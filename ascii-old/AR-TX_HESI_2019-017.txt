MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by HK Baugh Ranch, LLC
to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and assessment of the Riverbend Ranch tract
in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would involve developing
portions of an approximately 293.4-hectare (725.0-acre) tract as a residential subdivision. The
overall tract is bounded by Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 266 (North Old Bastrop Highway) to the
northwest, FM 621 (Staples Road) to the southwest, and the San Marcos River to the north. Of
the larger 293.4-hectare (725.0-acre) tract, approximately 80.9 hectares (200.0 acres) adjacent
to the San Marcos River would be left undeveloped, and a large artificial lake (the John F. Baugh
Reservoir) occupies an area of approximately 10.1 hectares (25.0 acres) in the southwestern
portion of the tract that would be left unmodified. Excluding the 80.9-hectare (200.0-acre) area
along the river that would remain undeveloped and the 10.1-hectare (25.0-acre) lake, the
proposed development would cover approximately 202.3 hectares (500.0 acres) of the tract.
Effectively, the northern boundary of proposed development within the tract would be the Rancho
del Camino Real Railroad Road, a one-lane paved driveway that provides access to the main
ranch complex near the northern margin of the tract (i.e., this driveway and all areas north of it
would remain outside the proposed limits of development). For purposes of the cultural resources
survey, the project area was considered to cover the approximately 202.3 hectares (500.0 acres)
of the overall property that falls within the boundaries of the proposed residential development
plan for property (Figures 1 to 3). The northern margin of the overall Riverbend Ranch property
actually extends slightly into Caldwell County north of the river, though the proposed development
area and corresponding survey area are located entirely within Hays County.
The proposed undertaking would be sponsored by HK Baugh Ranch, LLC, a private real
estate developer, on privately owned land. The developer is proposing to seek reimbursement
for some utility construction costs from a Public Improvement District (PID). Prior to initiating any
field activities, Horizon consulted with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) to determine
whether or not a PID qualifies as a political subdivision of the state of Texas. The PID would
provide financial remuneration for construction of some of the utilities within the proposed
residential subdivision but would not own any easements or lands within the development. The
THC recommended erring on the side of caution and conducting a survey under an Antiquities
Permit, and HK Baugh Ranch, LLC agreed to sponsor the survey. As such, for purposes of the
current undertaking, the project was considered to fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal

permits, licenses, or funds have been identified for the project. As the project THC, which serves
as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state of Texas, with an opportunity to
review and comment on the projectâs potential to adversely affect historic properties considered
eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL).
From April 1 to 5, 2019, Horizon archeologists Emily McCurdy, Jeffrey D. Owens,
Elizabeth Sefton, and Jared Wiersema conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the
project area. The survey was performed under the supervision of Jeffrey D. Owens, who served
as Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8831. The purpose of the survey
was to locate any significant cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
undertaking. Horizonâs archeologists traversed the project area on foot in parallel transects
spaced roughly 100.0 meters (328.1 feet) apart and thoroughly inspected the modern ground
surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The project area consists of an
extensive, open cattle pasture. Short pasture grasses covered the majority of the project area,
though the grass was quite short and patchy in most areas, affording good to excellent visibility
of the modern ground surface (60 to 100%). Ephemeral two-track field roads criss-cross the
project area, and several gravel roads provide access to different sections of the ranch. Extensive
trampling from cattle ranching was evident. Chert-bearing stream gravels ranging from small to
large in size are ubiquitous on the modern ground surface across the entire project area. Several
erosional cutbanks were observed within the project area that revealed a typical soil profile
consisting of a relatively shallow A horizon (apparently a former plowzone) underlain by extremely
dense gravel deposits, suggesting that the entire landform underlying the project area is a vast,
Pleistocene-age gravel bar. Many of the river gravels present within the project area are chertbearing, suggesting this area likely was a valuable source of lithic raw material throughout
prehistory. Similar sediment profiles were observed along the cutbanks of the unnamed stream
that flows through the project area. A large, artificial lake, the John F. Baugh Reservoir, occupies
an approximately 10.1-hectare (25.0-acre) area in the southwestern portion of the project area.
This lake was created by constructing an east-to-west-oriented earthen embankment across the
unnamed tributary. Several small boathouses are located along the edges of the dam. Numerous
small to moderate-sized stock ponds are also scattered throughout the project area. Disturbances
within the project area have been extensive, including construction of the John F. Baugh
Reservoir and numerous smaller stock tanks, a network of ephemeral field roads, and several
more substantial gravel roads throughout the ranch. Historically, the ranch was utilized primarily
for crop agriculture until the 1970s, and agricultural terracing is extensive throughout the project
area. Cattle ranching operations beginning in the 1980s have resulted in ongoing trampling of
the modern ground surface.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the TSMASS require a minimum of one shovel test per
1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) within project areas exceeding 40.5 hectares (100.0 acres) in size. As
such, 167 shovel tests would be required within the approximately 202.3-hectare (500.0-acre)
project area. Horizon excavated a total of 247 shovel tests during the survey, thereby exceeding
the shovel testing requirements for a project area of this size. Shovel testing revealed shallow
deposits of dense, gravelly, dark grayish-brown to black clay loam containing abundant river
gravels. Shovel tests were typically terminated a depths ranging from 10.0 to 45.0 centimeters
(3.9 to 17.7 inches) below surface due to the density of the river gravels.

The survey resulted in the re-location and reinvestigation of two previously recorded
archeological sites present within the project areaâ41HY272 and 41HY287. Site 41HY272
consists of an aboriginal lithic scatter situated atop a prominent hill in the approximate center of
the project area. At the time it was originally recorded in 1995 by Timothy K. Pertulla, this site
was described as consisting of tested chert cobbles, lithic debitage, bifaces in various stages of
reduction, and a few expedient flake tools. The site was recorded during a cultural resources
survey sponsored directly by the THC, though the purpose of the survey is not specified on the
site form. Site 41HY287 consists of an El Camino Real historical marker erected by the Daughters
of the American Revolution in 1918. This marker was recorded as an archeological site in 2000
in connection with an archeological survey conducted for a proposed Guadalupe-Blanco River
Authority (GBRA) raw water pipeline project, though the site consists only of the historical marker
and five crepe myrtle trees planted in a semi-circle surrounding the marker. These two sites are
recommended as ineligible for designation as SALs, and no further investigations are
recommended on either site.
Two additional previously recorded archeological sites within the project areaâ41HY288
and 41HY307)âwere not re-located or reinvestigated and appear to have been destroyed as a
result of construction activities associated with water pipeline projects undertaken within the past
20 years. Site 41HY288 was recorded in 2013 as a multiple-component site consisting of an
aboriginal campsite, represented by a scatter of burned rocks and lithic debitage, and an early
20th-century historic-age homestead or farmstead, represented by barbed wire fences, a utility
pole, a stock pond, and a scatter of porcelain and whiteware ceramic sherds and aqua, green,
and clear glass shards (though lacking any architectural features) located east of the intersection
of FM 266 (Old Bastrop Highway) and FM 621 (Staples Road). Site 41HY307 was recorded in
2000 as an aboriginal lithic scatter representing prehistoric lithic raw material procurement and
initial reduction activities located off the southern side of Rancho del Camino Real Railroad Road
(the private driveway that provides access to the Riverbend Ranch property).
Other recorded and unrecorded cultural resources are present nearby but beyond the
boundaries of the survey area associated with the proposed undertaking. Approximately
10 previously recorded archeological sites are located immediately beyond the boundaries of the
project area, but no evidence of any of these sites was observed within the project area during
the survey. Furthermore, a small cluster of historic-age structures and an isolated grave are
located along the private ranch driveway that provides access to the Riverbend Ranch tract.
These resources include the ca. 1870 Charles Lewis McGehee Cabin, a mid-20th-century house
occupied by the current ranch foreman, and the Clara McGehee Cemetery. The Clara McGehee
Cemetery consists of a single grave and headstone, that of Clara Lillian McGehee (born 1861;
died 1862), under a large live oak tree located near the abovementioned structures. There are
no indications of any additional graves on this small cemetery. All of these resources are located
outside of the boundaries of the current project area, and documenting these resources was
outside the scope of the current project.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify

H369-180258

Management Summary

historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified within the project
area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends
a finding of âno historic properties affected,â and no further archeological work is recommended
in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and
historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human
remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or
ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should
cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be notified
immediately. Following completion of the project, all project records will be prepared for
permanent curation at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by HK Baugh Ranch, LLC
to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and assessment of the Riverbend Ranch tract
in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would involve developing
portions of an approximately 293.4-hectare (725.0-acre) tract as a residential subdivision. The
overall tract is bounded by Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 266 (North Old Bastrop Highway) to the
northwest, FM 621 (Staples Road) to the southwest, and the San Marcos River to the north. Of
the larger 293.4-hectare (725.0-acre) tract, approximately 80.9 hectares (200.0 acres) adjacent
to the San Marcos River would be left undeveloped, and a large artificial lake (the John F. Baugh
Reservoir) occupies an area of approximately 10.1 hectares (25.0 acres) in the southwestern
portion of the tract that would be left unmodified. Excluding the 80.9-hectare (200.0-acre) area
along the river that would remain undeveloped and the 10.1-hectare (25.0-acre) lake, the
proposed development would cover approximately 202.3 hectares (500.0 acres) of the tract.
Effectively, the northern boundary of proposed development within the tract would be the Rancho
del Camino Real Railroad Road, a one-lane paved driveway that provides access to the main
ranch complex near the northern margin of the tract (i.e., this driveway and all areas north of it
would remain outside the proposed limits of development). For purposes of the cultural resources
survey, the project area was considered to cover the approximately 202.3 hectares (500.0 acres)
of the overall property that falls within the boundaries of the proposed residential development
plan for property (Figures 1 to 3). The northern margin of the overall Riverbend Ranch property
actually extends slightly into Caldwell County north of the river, though the proposed development
area and corresponding survey area are located entirely within Hays County.
The proposed undertaking would be sponsored by HK Baugh Ranch, LLC, a private real
estate developer, on privately owned land. The developer is proposing to seek reimbursement
for some utility construction costs from a Public Improvement District (PID). The PID would
provide financial reimbursements for construction of some of the utilities within the proposed
residential subdivision but would not own any easements or lands within the development. Prior
to initiating any field activities, Horizon consulted with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) to
determine whether or not a PID qualifies as a political subdivision of the state of Texas and
whether or not the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural
Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). The THC recommended erring on the side of caution
and conducting a survey under a Texas Antiquities Permit, and HK Baugh Ranch, LLC agreed to
sponsor the survey. As such, for purposes of the current undertaking, the project was considered

to fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. At this time, no federal
permits, licenses, or funds have been identified for the project. As the project represents a publicly
sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor was required to provide the THC, which serves as
the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state of Texas, with an opportunity to review
and comment on the projectâs potential to adversely affect historic properties considered eligible
for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL).
From April 1 to 5, 2019, Horizon archeologists Emily McCurdy, Jeffrey D. Owens,
Elizabeth Sefton, and Jared Wiersema conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the
project area. The survey was performed under the supervision of Jeffrey D. Owens, who served
as Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8831. The purpose of the survey
was to locate any significant cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
undertaking. The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the project area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the THCâs Rules of Practice and
Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 26, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for
Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and
cultural backgrounds, respectively, of the project area. Chapter 4.0 describes the results of
background archival research, and Chapter 5.0 discusses cultural resources survey methods
Chapter 6.0 presents the results of the cultural resources survey, and Chapter 7.0 presents
cultural resources management recommendations for the project. Chapter 8.0 lists the
references cited in the report, Appendix A summarizes shovel test data, and Appendix B contains
a master construction plan for the proposed development of the project area.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in southeastern San Marcos at the southern corner of Hays
County, Texas, near the boundary of two significant physiographic provincesâthe Edwards
Plateau and the Blackland Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated
between the Edwards Plateau on the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain on the east, is a low, rolling
land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the
Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an
area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and
streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are
associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between
uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer
rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in
others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone
in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
Physiographically, the project area is situated on gently rolling uplands located south of
the San Marcos River. Based on geomorphological characteristics of these landforms observed
in deep erosional gullies and cutbanks within the project area during the current survey, the
landforms within the project area appear to consist of an extensive Pleistocene-age gravel bar
containing dense, deep deposits of river-rolled gravels overlain by a shallow A horizon composed
of dense gravelly clay. Two branches of an unnamed tributary of the San Marcos River arise near
the western corner of the project area, flowing eastward into the John F. Baugh Reservoir in the
southwestern portion of the project area. The tributary continues eastward from the earthen dam
that impounds the lake, flowing eastward to its confluence with the San Marcos River near
Martindale along the Caldwell-Guadalupe county line. Elevations within the project area range
from approximately 170.7 to 195.1 meters (560.0 to 640.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl).
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the Guadalupe River basin. Hays
Countyâs numerous streams generally flow in an easterly direction. The principal waterways are
Bear, Cypress, and Onion creeks as well as the Blanco and San Marcos rivers. The Edwards
Aquifer underlies the eastern portion of the county, and the San Marcos Springs, located north of
the City of San Marcos, are the second largest in Texas, delivering over 102 million gallons daily.

H369-180258

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

The project area is situated on an upland landform just east of the confluence of the San Marcos
and Blanco rivers, and the San Marcos River forms the northern margin of the overall Riverbend
Ranch property. The San Marcos River meanders generally southeastward across the coastal
plain, discharging into the Guadalupe River near Gonzales in Gonzales County. The Guadalupe
River continues southeastward, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico near Port Lavaca.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Hays County is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age sedimentary rock strata,
while areas of alluvium may be present adjacent to major streams and rivers. Geologically, the
majority of the project area is situated on the Upper Cretaceous Pecan Gap Chalk Formation
(Kpg), which consists of chalk in the lower part grading upward to chalky marl with microgranular
calcite in clay matrix (USGS 2019). A small portion along the northeastern margin of the survey
area is situated on the Upper Cretaceous Navarro Group and Marlbrook Marl (âupper Taylor marlâ)
(Kknm), which consists of clay in the lower part grading upward to calcareous, massive, thinly
laminated clay in the upper part (USGS 2019). The floodplain of the San Marcos River to the
north is characterized by Quaternary-age fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt), though the survey area
does not extend onto the river floodplain (USGS 2019).
The project area traverses a mosaic of soil units typically composed of calcareous clayey
alluvium of Late Pleistocene age mixed with smaller areas of clayey residuum that formed in situ
from mudstone bedrock (Table 1; Figure 4) (NRCS 2019). The vast majority of the landforms and
soils within the project area are of considerable antiquity and pre-date the Holocene epoch. A
narrow sliver along the northeastern margin of the project area is situated on the Oakalla soil unit,
which represents the only Holocene-age alluvial soil within the project area, though this area
represents less than 0.1% of the overall project area. Areas along the unnamed tributary of Onion
Creek that flows through the project area on either side of the John F. Baugh Reservoir are
characterized by Quaternary-age Tinn series alluvium.
While aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial sediments
adjacent to major streams in Central Texas, the antiquity of the landforms and soils within the
project area suggests that any aboriginal cultural resources present would be constrained to the
modern ground surface and/or shallowly buried contexts in erosional settings lacking depth and
integrity. Historic-age resources may occur in virtually any physiographic setting but are most
common in urban settings and in rural areas suitable for agriculture. The majority of the project
area is characterized by agricultural land located adjacent to the San Marcos River and has
potential for historic-age resources.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably

cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily
forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by
grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to
5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Hays County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is influenced
primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by polar air
masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and fall.
Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate characterized
by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas manifest
regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west
and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical
subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (cm) (32.0 inches [in]) and
temperature averages 19Â°Celsius (C) (67Â°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36Â°C (96Â°F) in
August (the warmest month) to 15Â°C (59Â°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time,
however, drier periods lasting from three to seven years, when total annual rainfall ranged from
30.5 to 63.5 centimeters (12 to 25 inches), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to
127.0 centimeters (45.0 to 50.0 inches) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall. Two
extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain that fell within an 18hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9-centimeters (22.0inches) deluge that fell in less than three hours near OâHarris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently
that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east
often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from
the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the
region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943). Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary,
characterized as âapproximate,â between Blairâs (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes
through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in the Texan province
is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite (1948) as a C2 (moist
subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and
hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this soil
type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas include
the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies.
Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat and bog
marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert pocket gopher
(Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse
(Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit
(Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), ground squirrel
(Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana), hispid pocket mouse
(Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and
jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the Austroriparian provinceâeastern
box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)âoccur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including seven grassland and nine forest species, are also
found, including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis) (grassland
species), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus
olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink (Eumeces
obsoletus) (forest species). Only five species of urodele fauna are known from this area, including
small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and
eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts as a barrier to urodele

distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west and the Austroriparian
fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouseâs toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the Texan
into the Austroriparian province include Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Streckerâs chorus
frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile and
amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchardâs cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water snake
(Nerodia rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early
historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewittâs (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of
North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian
bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and
settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central
Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There
is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is
divided into two periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These

H369-180258

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points
(i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which
is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and
Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most markedly,
burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the Late
Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In addition,
the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute evidence
of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially accounts for the
lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Ãlvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed

16

180258_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of
500.0 Acres of the Riverbend Ranch Tract, San Marcos, Hays County, Texas

South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay. However,
European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The first half of
the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as the first
effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social systems.
This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data suggest population
declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation on the part of the
Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement of Texas began in
the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
Before the first Spanish explorations of the area, several Native American cultures
occupied the Edwards Plateau and the area now known as Hays County. This included the
distinct archeological manifestation known as the Toyah Phase as well as the descendants of the
Coahuiltecan-speakers, the Payaya, Tonkawa, and Jumano (which included sub-groups Cibolo,
Hape, Mescale, Cholome, Cantona, Catqueza, and Caynaya) (Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012; Wade
2003). Post-European-contact tribes included the Lipan Apache, Kiowa-Apache, Wichita, and
Comanche (Newcomb 1961; Wade 2003). Lesser-known groups and âmicro-social coalitionsâ
included the Ape, Arame, Bagname, Bobole, Ervipiame, Geniocane, Gueiquesale, Jumee,
Mabibit, Manos Priestas, Natage, Ocane, Pataguache, Pinanaca, Siano, Teaname, Teroodan,
Ypandi, Xaesar, and Xoman, all of which appeared in the Spanish records beginning in the mid18th century (Wade 2003).
The Tonkawa Indians, whose tribal name is a Waco word, tonkaweya, which means âthey
all stay together,â were historically tied to Central Texas as early as the late 17th century (Jones
1969:65; Newcomb 1961:134). Their linguistic family was thought to be affiliated with Karankawa,
Comecrudo, and Cotoname, all a part of the Coahuiltecan stock (Swanton 1915, 1940); however,
the former three languages are extinct, resulting in difficulties in establishing any relationships to
Tonkawan (Jones 1969). The Tonkawa may have been an amalgamation of several independent
bands, including the Tonkawas proper, the Mayeyes, the Cava, the Cantona, the Emet, the Sana,
the Toho, and the Tohaha Indians (Carlisle 2010).
Led by Friar Nicolas Lopez and Juan Dominguez de Mendoza, the Mendoza-Lopez
Expedition of 1684 was sent by the Spanish Crown to explore the unchartered âKingdom of Tejasâ
and to document the encroaching French presence from the East (Wade 2003). As the entrada
made their way eastward through the Edwards Plateau, they came across the present-day San
Marcos Springs on January 28. There, the Spanish expedition camped for several days and killed
31 bison bulls, celebrated Mass, and named the river in honor of Saint Mark (Wade 2003).
Several years later, in 1691, Governor Domingo Teran de los Rios and his expedition came
through the area now known as San Marcos. Near the San Marcos River, de los Rios
encountered several thousand Native Americans mostly from West Texas (the Cibola and
Catqueza) and north-central Mexico parading with banners with images Our Lady of Guadalupe
and carrying a âlarge, well-preserved wooden crossâ (Foster 2008:185). As New Spain expanded
the boundaries of its frontier north past the Rio Grande, the viceroy in Mexico City had sent the
Aguirre expedition to pursue lands upon which to build future mission and presidio complexes
(Chipman 1992). This was part of a continuing effort to convert the Tejas indios (Chipman 1992).
In April 1701, Fathers Olivares and Espinosa traveled with the Aguirre entrada to the area of

H369-180258

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

present-day Hays County, where they were explored the San Marcos and Blanco rivers as well
as Onion Creek (Chipman 1992). In 1727, Brigadier General Pedro de Rivera y Villalon
encountered several bison on the San Marcos and Blanco rivers (Wade 2003). It was a common
occurrence for several bands of Native Americans to travel upwards to 643.7 kilometers
(400.0 miles) from West Texas and northern Mexico to hunt bison on the Southern Plains in
central Texas during the height of the âLittle Ice Ageâ from A.D. 1400 to 1700 (Foster 2008).
El Camino Real, also known as El Camino Real de los Tejas and later as the Old San
Antonio Road, passed through Hays County and linked the mission systems of northeastern
Texas and western Louisiana with the Spanish frontier in northern Mexico and southward to
Mexico City. This dendritic system of roads was the most important channel of immigration,
commerce, communication, and supplies for the Spanish presidio-mission complexes and
provincial government centers in Tejas. Officially established by the Teran de los Rios entrada in
1691, it is likely that the Spanish used preexisting indigenous trading routes that linked Caddoan
people to Coahuiltecans and Jumanos (Chipman 1992; Foster 2008; Wade 2003).
The first attempts at Spanish colonization in the area of present-day Hays County began
in late 1755, when Capitan Rabago, under the orders of Governor Barrio, removed the San Xavier
Mission and San Francisco Xavier Presidio from the confluence of the San Gabriel River and
Brushy Creek to a more favorable site on the San Marcos River (Chipman 1992; Wade 2003).
The decision to relocate may have been made to provide closer military protection for the Los
Almagres Ore Mine in San Saba (Wade 2003). This move was short-lived, however, and the San
Xavier presidio-mission complex was removed to San Antonio in 1756 (Chipman 1992). Despite
this relocation, Capitan Parrilla, en route to the Los Almagras mine, moved nine Tlaxcaltecan
families, cattle, supplies, and troops to San Marcos from March to May 1757, though it is
unconfirmed where exactly they settled or what accommodations they utilized (Wade 2003). Hays
County generally laid dormant from European excursions until the Spanish settlement San
Marcos de Neve was founded from 1808 to 1812. It was positioned at the junction of the Camino
Real and the San Marcos River, and 82 persons, mostly born in New Spain, practiced agriculture
and livestock husbandry until the villa was eventually abandoned due to Comanche, Tonkawa,
and Tawakoni attacks, floods, and crop failures (Folsom 2010).
After the Mexican War for Independence, several empresarios, or land grants, were issued
to capitalists Juan Martin Veramendi, Juan Vicente Campos, and Thomas Jefferson Chambers in
an attempt to populate the area (Cecil and Greene 2010). The Mexican government operating
from the Departments of Coahuila and Texas issued a league of land to Thomas G. McGehee,
the first Anglo-American to settle what is present-day Hays County, in 1835 (Cecil and Green
2010). In March of 1848, the nascent Texas Congress carved Hays County, named in honor of
John Coffee Haysâ Texas Rangers company, was carved from the territory south of Travis County.
By 1850, San Marcos was chosen as the county seat. From 1850 to 1860, the countyâs population
grew from a mere 387 to 2,126 as more Anglo-Americans settled the area. In 1849, General
Edward Burleson dammed the San Marcos Springs to generate power for his saw and grist mills,
which resulted in the formation of San Marcos Springs Lake. Hays Countyâs first cotton gin was
built by W.A. Thompson in the early 1850s, and, soon after, Ezekiel Nance, utilizing slave labor,
built a dam on the Blanco River to power his sawmill, gristmill, and cotton gin (Nance 2010). The

first Methodist church congregation was organized by Alfred B.F. Kerr in San Marcos in 1847,
and the first schools were established between the years 1849 and 1852 (Cecil and Greene 2010;
Williamson 2010).
Many of the first Anglo-American settlers in Hays County were from Arkansas, Georgia,
and the Deep South; as such, the majority of the countyâs eligible voters (n=166) voted in favor of
secession from the Union in February 1861 (Timmons 1973). Several citizens from the county
volunteered for the Confederate Army, including Colonel Peter C. Woodâs Thirty-sixth Texas
Calvary and Company A (Cecil and Greene 2010). The post-war Reconstruction period in Hays
County saw an economic spur resulting from the cattle drive industry as well as the intensification
of agriculture that was practiced in the more arable Blackland prairies found in the eastern half of
the county. The population boomed from 4,088 in 1870 to 14,142 in 1900 as more settlers saw
opportunities afforded by institutions of education, such as the Coronal Institute founded in 1866
and the Southwest Texas Normal School chartered in 1903. Also adding to the prosperity was
the Hays County rail line funded by the International-Great Northern Railroad, which connected
San Marcos to Austin and, later, to San Antonio (Cecil and Greene 2010). By World War I, Hays
County was predominantly dependent upon an agricultural economy, and the population
remained relatively stagnant until the opening of the Gary Job Corps Training Center in 1964 and
an enrollment boom at Southwest Texas University when it officially switched from a teacherâs
college in 1969. By 1970, the population of the county was 27,642.
Today, San Marcos is home to several endangered species including the Texas Blind
Salamander, the fountain darter, and the San Marcos gambusia. A rare species of aquatic rice,
the Texas wild-rice, only grows within a 0.8-kilometer (0.5-mile) radius of San Marcos Springs.
Perched on top the Edwards Aquifer discharge zone, the city sits above a system of unique
limestone caves, including Wonder World Cave, Ezell Cave, and enormous aquatic caves full of
unique fauna such as the blind albino catfish. Camp Ben McCulloch, positioned on Onion Creek
near Driftwood, was organized in 1896 to serve as a Confederate soldier reunion camp; today, it
hosts several festivals, such as Old Settlers Music Festival. As of 2018, Hays County has a
population of 222,631, and 24% of its citizens have a bachelorâs degree. Whites dominate the
ethnic makeup of the county at 88%, African-Americans at 4%, and Asians at 1%. Texas State
University is a large provider of jobs, and in 2018 the school had 38,666 students enrolled.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed the THCâs Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (TASA) online database for information on previously recorded archeological sites and
previous archeological investigations conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the
project area. Based on this archival research, 25 previously recorded archeological sites, four
cemeteries, and a segment of El Camino Real de los Tejas (a National Historic Trail) are located
within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the project area (Figure 5; Table 2) (THC 2019).
The previously recorded archeological sites consist of a mix of aboriginal campsites and
lithic scatters related primarily to lithic raw material procurement activities, historic-age farmsteads
and debris scatters, features related to El Camino Real, and multiple-component sites that contain
both prehistoric and historic-age components. Of the 25 known archeological sites, 17 sites
contain aboriginal cultural components consisting of lithic artifact scatters that date mostly to
undermined prehistoric timeframes based on a lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, though
prehistoric components dating to the PaleoIndian and Early Archaic periods were observed on
two sites. Fourteen of the 25 archeological sites contain historic-age components consisting of
historic-age farmsteads and homesteads, domestic debris scatters lacking associated
architectural or cultural features, and two sites that relate to El Camino Real. Most of the historicage farmsteads and homesteads have been dated only to undetermined historic timeframes,
though dates spanning the early 19th to mid-20th centuries have been suggested for five of the
sites. No information is on file regarding two of the previously recorded sites.
Two of the 25 archeological sites relate to El Camino Real (41HY287 and 41HY290), a
branching Spanish Colonial roadway system that connected Spanish missions across southern,
central, and northeastern Texas to western Louisiana to the east and Mexico to the south. Site
41HY290 refers to a segment of El Camino Real recorded adjacent to and off the northwestern
side of FM 266 (Old Bastrop Highway) to the southwest of the project area. Site 41HY287
consists of a small granite historical marker placed off the southeastern side of FM 266 northeast
of its intersection with FM 621 (Staples Road). This marker identifies FM 266 as El Camino Real
and was erected by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1918.
Many of the known cultural resources are located well outside of the project area and
would not be disturbed as a result of the proposed undertaking. However, four of the previously
recorded archeological sites (41HY272, 41HY287, 41HY288, and 41HY307) are located within

the current project area. Two of these four sites (41HY272 and 41HY287) within the current
project area were re-located and reinvestigated during the current survey. Site 41HY272 consists
of an aboriginal lithic scatter situated atop a prominent hill in the approximate center of the project
area. At the time it was originally recorded in 1995 by Timothy K. Pertulla, this site was described
as consisting of tested chert cobbles, lithic debitage, bifaces in various stages of reduction, and
a few expedient flake tools. The site was recorded during a cultural resources survey sponsored
directly by the THC, though the purpose of the survey is not specified on the site form. Site
41HY287 consists of the abovementioned El Camino Real historical marker erected by the
Daughters of the American Revolution in 1918. This marker was recorded as an archeological
site in 2000 in connection with an archeological survey conducted for a proposed GuadalupeBlanco River Authority (GBRA) raw water pipeline project, though the site consists only of the
historical marker and five crepe myrtle trees planted in a semi-circle surrounding the marker.
Sites 41HY272 and 41HY287 are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.0, Results of
Investigations.
The remaining two previously recorded sites (41HY288 and 41HY307) within the current
project area were not re-located or reinvestigated and appear to have been destroyed as a result
of construction activities associated with the abovementioned water pipeline projects. Site

H369-180258

25

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research

41HY288 was recorded in 2013 as a multiple-component site consisting of an aboriginal campsite,
represented by a scatter of burned rocks and lithic debitage, and an early 20th-century historicage homestead or farmstead, represented by barbed wire fences, a utility pole, a stock pond, and
a scatter of porcelain and whiteware ceramic sherds and aqua, green, and clear glass shards
(though lacking any architectural features) located east of the intersection of FM 266 (Old Bastrop
Highway) and FM 621 (Staples Road). This site was recorded during an archeological survey
conducted for a Crystal Clear Water Supply Corporation water pipeline project (Nickels 2013).
Site 41HY307 was recorded in 2000 as an aboriginal lithic scatter representing prehistoric lithic
raw material procurement and initial reduction activities located off the southern side of Rancho
del Camino Real Railroad Road (the private driveway that provides access to the Riverbend
Ranch property). The site was recorded during an archeological survey conducted for the Canyon
Regional Water Authority Pipeline Project (Schoeder et al. 2000).
Furthermore, eight additional previously recorded archeological sites (41HY282,
41HY308, 41HY397, 41HY398, 41HY399, 41HY404, 41HY410, and 41HY411) and one cemetery
(the Clara McGehee Cemetery) are located either along the current survey area boundary or
immediately beyond it. Six of these eight sites (41HY397, 41HY398, 41HY399, 41HY404,
41HY410, 41HY411) were recorded in 2007 during a cultural resources survey conducted of the
proposed right-of-way of FM 110 (Roger et al. 2007). The majority of these six sites (41HY397,
41HY398, 41HY399, 41HY404, 41HY411) consist of aboriginal lithic scatters and historic-age
debris scatters of undetermined prehistoric and/or historic age, though one of the six sites
(41HY410) consists of an early 20th-century farmstead (several standing buildings associated
with this farmstead are visible on modern aerial imagery to the southeast of the project area). An
unnamed private driveway extends northeastward from FM 621 (Staples Road), roughly
paralleling the southeastern boundary of the project area all the way northeast to the San Marcos
River, which likely explains the presence of historic-age debris along this feature. The linear
FM 110 survey corridor ran the length of the southeastern boundary of the current project area,
though the survey area abutted the boundary of the Riverbend Ranch property and did not actually
cross over onto it. Of the remaining two of the eight sites located adjacent to the project area
(41HY282 and 41HY308), site 41HY282 consists of an aboriginal lithic scatter of undetermined
age, and 41HY308 reportedly consists of the Baugh Homestead, which consists of a sparse
scatter of late 19th-century domestic debris (no architectural or cultural features were noted).
Both sites 41HY282 and 41HY308 were recorded in 2000 during the GBRA raw water pipeline
survey mentioned above. Finally, the Clara McGehee Cemetery is located off the eastern side of
Rancho del Camino Real Railroad Road, the private driveway that provides access to the
Riverbend Ranch. This cemetery consists of a single grave and headstone, that of Clara Lillian
McGehee (born 1861; died 1862), under a large live oak tree near a small cluster of historic-age
structures (Figures 6 and 7). There is no indication of any additional graves surrounding the grave
of Clara McGehee, and this isolated grave and the nearby historic-age buildings, including the ca.
1870 Charles Lewis McGehee Cabin (Figure 9) and a mid-20th-century house occupied by the
current ranch foreman (Figure 8), are located well outside the boundary of the project area (these
resources were photo-documented during the survey, though they are not present within the
project area). The McGehee Cabin has an Official Texas Historical Marker (OTHM) and a 1989
Landmarks Award from The Heritage Association of San Marcos mounted by the front door.

Finally, a segment of El Camino Real de los Tejas, a branch of a Spanish Colonial roadway
system that extended through southern, central, and eastern Texas, has been documented in the
vicinity of the project area. As noted above, a segment of the trail itself was observed adjacent
to FM 266 to the southwest of the project area that was recorded as site 41HY290, and a granite
historical marker (site 41HY287) was erected off the southeastern side of FM 266 just northeast
of its intersection with FM 621 noting that this roadway represents the former El Camino Real de
los Tejas. The projection of El Camino Real de los Tejas shown in Figure 5 shows the trail
extending through the northwestern portion of the project area, though it should be noted that this
projection is based on historical maps of questionable accuracy at this scale. It is likely that
FM 266 (the Old Bastrop Highway) represents the actual alignment of the historic trail in this area.
This roadway forms the northwestern boundary of the project area but does not extend within the
project area.
A review of historical aerial photographs dating from 1954 to the present and US
Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps dating from 1966 to the present indicates that no
historic-age structures have stood within the project area since the mid-20th century, though
several structures are shown on historical imagery off the northern side of Rancho del Camino
Real Railroad Road just north of the survey area that are still present (NETR 2019). Historical
aerial photographs show that the ranch was used primarily for crop agriculture in the 1970s, and
extensive agricultural terracing is evident that suggests the ranch had been adapted for crop
agriculture for at least several decades prior. From the 1980s onwards, however, the property
appears to have been primarily used for cattle ranching. A small cluster of historic-age buildings
is evident on all historical images along the Rancho del Camino Real Railroad Roadâas
discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.0, Results of Investigations, these resources include the
Charles Lewis McGehee Cabin, a ranchhand house that appears to have been constructed in the
mid-20th century, the Clara Lillian McGehee grave, and some open-sided equipment storage
sheds. A second complex of buildings currently stands at the northern end of the Rancho del
Camino Real Railroad Road to the north of the survey area. These buildings are the dwellings of
the current owners of the ranch and were constructed in the 1990s and early 2000s; therefore,
these structures are not of historic age (NETR 2019).
Based on the THCâs TASA database, four prior cultural resources surveys have been
conducted within or immediately adjacent to the project area. In 1995, the THC sponsored a
small survey that covered a prominent hill east of the John F. Baugh Reservoir in the approximate
center of the project area for an unspecified project. In 2000, the proposed right-of-way of a
GBRA raw water pipeline was surveyed along the northwestern margin of the project area (this
raw water pipeline was subsequently constructed, and disturbances within an approximately 15.2meter- [50.0-foot-] wide linear corridor were observed during the current survey extending along
the entire northwestern edge of the project area). In 2007, the proposed right-of-way of FM 110
was surveyed along the southeastern margin of the project area, though this survey does not
appear to have actually crossed over onto the Riverbend Ranch property (Roger et al. 2007). In
2013, the proposed right-of-way for a Crystal Clear Water Supply Corporation water pipeline was
surveyed along the northeastern side of FM 621 (Staples Road) (Nickels 2013). The vast majority
of the property has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

From April 1 to 5, 2019, Horizon archeologists Emily McCurdy, Jeffrey D. Owens,
Elizabeth Sefton, and Jared Wiersema conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the
project area. The survey was performed under the supervision of Jeffrey D. Owens, who served
as Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8831. The purpose of the survey
was to locate any significant cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
undertaking. Horizonâs archeologists traversed the project area on foot in parallel transects
spaced roughly 100.0 meters (328.1 feet) apart and thoroughly inspected the modern ground
surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The project area consists of an
extensive, open cattle pasture (Figures 10 to 11). Short pasture grasses covered the majority of
the project area, though the grass was quite short and patchy in most areas, affording good to
excellent visibility of the modern ground surface (60 to 100%). Ephemeral two-track field roads
criss-cross the project area (see Figure 11), and several gravel roads provide access to different
sections of the ranch. Extensive trampling from cattle ranching was evident (Figure 12). Chertbearing stream gravels ranging from small to large in size are ubiquitous on the modern ground
surface across the entire project area (Figure 13). Several erosional cutbanks were observed
within the project area that revealed a typical soil profile consisting of a relatively shallow A horizon
(apparently a former plowzone) underlain by extremely dense gravel deposits, suggesting that
the entire landform underlying the project area is a vast, Pleistocene-age gravel bar (Figures 14
to 16). Many of the river gravels present within the project area are chert-bearing, suggesting this
area likely was a valuable source of lithic raw material throughout prehistory. Similar sediment
profiles were observed along the cutbanks of the unnamed stream that flows through the project
area (Figure 17). A large, artificial lake, the John F. Baugh Reservoir, occupies an approximately
10.1-hectare (25.0-acre) area in the southwestern portion of the project area (Figures 18 to 19).
This lake was created by constructing an east-to-west-oriented earthen embankment across the
unnamed tributary (Figure 20). Several small boathouses are located along the edges of the dam
(Figure 21). Numerous small to moderate-sized stock ponds are also scattered throughout the
project area (Figures 22 to 23).
Disturbances within the project area have been extensive, including construction of the
John F. Baugh Reservoir and numerous smaller stock tanks, a network of ephemeral field roads,
and several more substantial gravel roads throughout the ranch. As noted in the previous chapter,
the ranch was utilized primarily for crop agriculture until the 1970s, and agricultural terracing is

extensive throughout the project area (Figure 24). Cattle ranching operations beginning in the
1980s have resulted in ongoing trampling of the modern ground surface, and water pipelines have
been constructed along the northwestern and southwestern boundaries of the project area.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of one shovel test per 1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) within
project areas exceeding 40.5 hectares (100.0 acres) in size. As such, 167 shovel tests would be
required within the approximately 202.3-hectare (500.0-acre) project area. Horizon excavated a
total of 247 shovel tests during the survey, thereby exceeding the shovel testing requirements for
a project area of this size (Figures 25 to 27). Shovel testing revealed shallow deposits of dense,
gravelly, dark grayish-brown to black clay loam containing abundant river gravels. Shovel tests
were typically terminated a depths ranging from 10.0 to 45.0 centimeters (3.9 to 17.7 inches)
below surface due to the density of the river gravels. All sediments were screened through 6.35millimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of
all shovel tests were determined using hand-held Garmin eTrex Global Positioning System (GPS)
devices based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel testing was capable of
fully penetrating sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits, and it
is Horizonâs opinion that the pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and judgmental shovel
testing were adequate to evaluate the cultural resources potential of the project area. Specific
data for all 247 shovel tests excavated during the survey are presented in Appendix A.
Two of the four previously recorded archeological sites present within the project area
were re-located and reinvestigated during the surveyâ41HY272 and 41HY287. Site 41HY272

consists of a sparse scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage and tested cores on the crest and slopes
of a prominent hill in the approximate center of the project area, and site 41HY287 consists of a
small, pink granite historical marker erected off the side of FM 266 in the western corner of the
project area by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1918 to mark the location of El
Camino Real (i.e., FM 266; a.k.a. Old Bastrop Highway). In the field, standard site recording
forms were used to record pertinent information on location, physiographic setting, and local
environmental characteristics; types and quantities of artifacts observed; distribution and
densities of artifacts; characteristics of standing architectural features; artificial and natural
impacts; and the condition of surface and subsurface archeological deposits. Scaled sketch maps
were drawn that illustrated site boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural features, standing
architectural features; and/or material concentrations; as well as notable features of the
landscape. The sites were thoroughly photo-documented using color digital photography, and
photographic logs were maintained of all photographs taken. Based on the information recorded
on the standard archeological site recording forms in the field, Texas Archeological Data Site
Update Forms were completed by Horizonâs laboratory personnel using the most current version
of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratoryâs (TARL) TexSite archeological data collection
software, and the forms were submitted to TARL to update the existing site files.
Attempts to re-locate the remaining two previously recorded archeological site within the
project areaâ41HY288 and 41HY307âwere unsuccessful. Site 41HY288 was recorded as a
multiple-component site containing a scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage and burned rocks and
the remnants of a possible early 20th-century farmstead or homestead consisting of some barbed
wire fencing, a utility pole, and a few ceramic sherds and glass shards located near the
intersection of FM 266 and FM 621 in the western corner of the project area. Site 41HY307 was
recorded as a sparse scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage extending along the southern side of the
Rancho del Camino Real Railroad Road, the private driveway that provides access to the
Riverbend Ranch property. Both of these sites were initially recorded during cultural resources
surveys associated with water pipeline projects, and these water pipeline projects were
subsequently constructed. While a rectangular stock tank is present in the western corner of the
project area that may have been associated with site 41HY288 (see Figure 23), all other
indications of this site are gone. It is Horizonâs opinion that construction of the pipelines effectively
destroyed the archeological deposits associated with sites 41HY288 and 41HY307.
Furthermore, attempts to re-locate site 41HY308, reportedly the location of the original
Baugh Homestead, were unsuccessful (see the âArea Aâ inset in Figure 25, which marks the
approximate location of site 41HY308). The mapped location of this site actually falls outside the
boundaries of the current project area, but extra shovel tests were excavated in this area to
determine whether or not this site potentially extended into the project area. No cultural resources
were observed in this area. Similarly, no cultural resources were observed along the southeastern
boundary of the project area near the mapped locations of several sites recorded just beyond the
boundaries of the Riverbend Ranch tract during a prior survey of the proposed right-of-way of
FM 110 (see Figure 5).
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log

H369-180258

43

Chapter 5.0: Survey Methodology

was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with makerâs marks) and nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural resources were collected during the survey. Following
completion of the project, all project records will be prepared for permanent curation at TARL.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a âreasonable and goodfaith effortâ to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 CFR
800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Two of the four previously recorded archeological sites present within the project area
were re-located and reinvestigated during the surveyâ41HY272 and 41HY287. Site 41HY272
consists of a sparse scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage and tested cores on the crest and slopes
of a prominent hill in the approximate center of the project area, and site 41HY287 consists of a
small, pink granite historical marker erected off the side of FM 266 in the western corner of the
project area by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1918 to mark the location of El
Camino Real (i.e., FM 266; a.k.a. Old Bastrop Highway). These two sites are discussed in detail
below.
No new archeological sites were documented during the survey. As noted in the previous
chapter, the project area consists of open pastures and former agricultural land that is situated on
a vast gravel bar of probable Pleistocene age. River gravels ranging in size from pebbles to small
boulders are ubiquitous throughout the project area on the modern ground surface, and the gravel
deposits increase in density with depth to the point where effectively very little soil is present within
the gravel matrix. Many of these river gravels are chert-bearing. The project area contains an
almost continuous, very low-density scatter of tested cobbles and lithic debitage. Average artifact
densities were typically in the range of one artifact per 100.0 square meters (1,076.4 square feet).
This distribution of cultural materials is typical of lithic raw material procurement locales in central
Texas; however, with the exception of site 41HY272, no concentrations of cultural materials were
observed that warranted recording as archeological sites. Undoubtedly, the historical land use
within the ranch for crop agriculture until the 1970s and cattle ranching beginning in the 1980s
and continuing to the present day has resulted in relatively extensive disturbances that probably
obscure any spatial patterning of prehistoric cultural materials that may once have been present.
Notably, river cobbles artificially broken through decades of agricultural and cattle ranching
activities are far more common than prehistoric artifacts that exhibit clear morphological
characteristics of flintknapping, such as bulbs of percussion (and associated flake scars) and
striking platforms.

SITE 41HY272
General Description

Site 41HY272 consists of a low-density scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, including tested
chert-bearing river cobbles, river cobble cores, and lithic debitage, on the crest and slopes of a

prominent hill in the approximate center of the project area (Figures 28 to 30). This site was
originally recorded by Timothy K. Perttula in 1995 during a cultural resources survey sponsored
directly by the THC for an unspecified purpose. At the time, the site was recorded as covering an
area measuring roughly 240.0 meters (787.4 feet) north to south by 180.0 meters (590.6 feet)
east to west, though the mapped boundaries depicted on the THCâs TASA online database are
somewhat larger, measuring approximately 310.0 meters (1,017.1 feet) north to south by
250.0 meters (820.2 feet) east to west. At the time, the site was described as containing large,
tested chert cobbles; lithic debitage; scattered limestone burned rocks; thick bifaces in various
stages of reduction; and a few flake tools. Archeological deposits were described as extending
to depths of 20.0 to 30.0 centimeters (7.9 to 11.8 inches) below surface.
Horizon confirmed the location and general characteristics of site 41HY272 noted on the
original site form during the current survey. The site falls within a large cattle pasture, and the
site is covered in short pasture grasses. The site is defined based on a slightly higher density of
aboriginal lithic materials than the surrounding area, though no high-density concentrations of
cultural materials were observed on the site. Elevations on the range from approximately 182.9 to
187.5 meters (600.0 to 615.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
The dimensions of the site depicted on the THCâs TASA online database were not modified
based on the results of Horizonâs survey activities. As such, site 41HY272 defines a roughly
circular area on the crest and sideslopes of the prominent hill on which it is situated, measuring
roughly 310.0 meters (1,017.1 feet) north to south by 250.0 meters (820.2 feet) east to west.
A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated within the delineated boundaries of site
41HY272, though numerous additional shovel tests were excavated in the surrounding area.
Cultural materials observed on site 41HY272 are constrained primarily to the modern ground
surface, though a few artifacts were observed at depths of 10.0 to 30.0 centimeters (3.9 to
11.8 inches) below surface in three of the shovel tests excavated on the site. Sediments on the
site consist of shallow, dense, gravelly very dark grayish-brown to black clay loam overlying dense
gravels. Shovel testing was capable of fully penetrating sediments with the potential to contain
subsurface cultural resources.
Observed Cultural Features
No cultural features or indirect evidence of cultural features, such as burned rocks, were
observed on site 41HY272, though scattered burned rocks were noted on the site form when the
site was originally recorded in 1995.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41HY272 consist of a low-density surface and shallow
subsurface scatter of tested chert-bearing river cobbles, cobble cores with multiple large flakes
removed, and associated lithic debitage and shatter. No bifaces, expedient flake tools, or burned
rocks were observed, though these were described on the original site form. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts were observed.

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41HY272 consists of an extensive, low-density surface and shallow subsurface
scatter of aboriginal tested chert cobbles, cobble cores, and lithic debitage on the crest and slopes
of a prominent upland landform. Chert-bearing river cobbles are ubiquitous on the site and in the
surrounding area, and the site is interpreted as a lithic raw material procurement locale (i.e.,
âquarryâ) where the initial stages of core reduction and stone tool manufacture were conducted.
Cultural materials are constrained primarily to the modern ground surface, though a few artifacts
were observed in three positive shovel tests at depths ranging from 10.0 to 30.0 centimeters
(3.9 to 11.8 inches) below surface, and prior impacts from agricultural terracing, plowing, and
harvesting; ongoing cattle ranching activities; and erosion are evident. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were observed, and the site can be dated only to an undetermined prehistoric timeframe.
Based on the extent of prior disturbances, the lack of integrity of archeological deposits, and the
lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, site 41HY272 possesses minimal potential to contribute to
an understanding of the prehistoric past. The site is recommended as ineligible for designation
as an SAL, and no further work is recommended on the site in connection with the proposed
undertaking.

6.2

SITE 41HY287
General Description

Site 41HY287 consists of a pink granite historical marker erected in a small, fenced
enclosure off the southeastern side of FM 266 (Old Bastrop Highway) approximately 40.0 meters
(131.2 feet) northeast of its intersection with FM 621 (Staples Road) (Figures 31 to 33). The
marker commemorates the location of El Camino Real, which is believed to be coextensive with
FM 266 in this area. The marker was put in place by the Daughters of the American Revolution
in 1918. This historical marker was recorded as an archeological site in 2000 during a cultural
resources survey for a GBRA raw water pipeline. The raw water pipeline was subsequently
installed, as evidenced by a disturbed linear right-of-way that runs along the northwestern margin
of the project area, though the historical marker was left in place. Horizon confirmed the presence
of the historical marker that represents site 41HY287, though the setting and characteristics of
this small âsiteâ have not changed since the site was recorded in 2000.
Horizontal and Vertical Extent of Cultural Resources
The historical marker is situated within a small fenced enclosure at the edge of the FM 266
right-of-way, facing northwest toward the road. The fenced enclose measures 3.0 meters
(9.8 feet) in length northeast to southwest by 2.0 meters (6.6 feet) in depth northwest to
southeast. No shovel tests were excavated as the site does not have the potential for subsurface
archeological deposits.
Observed Cultural Features
Site 41HY287 consists of a single cultural feature, a pink granite historical marker set into
the ground facing FM 266 (a.k.a. Old Bastrop Highway) to the northwest. The marker reads as
follows:
Kings Highway
Camino Real
Old San Antonio Road
Marked by the
Daughters of the
American Revolution
and the State of Texas
A.D. 1918

Five crepe myrtle trees have been planted in a semi-circle across the back of the small
fenced enclosure that frames the marker.
Observed Cultural Materials
Aside from the historical marker and the accompanying small decorative copse of crepe
myrtle trees, no cultural materials are present on site 41HY287.

Summary and Conclusions
Site 41HY287 consists of a pink granite historical marker erected in a small, fenced
enclosure off the southeastern side of FM 266 (Old Bastrop Highway) near its intersection with
FM 621 (Staples Road). The marker was erected in 1918 by the Daughters of the American
Revolution to commemorate El Camino Real, which is likely to be coextensive with FM 266 in this
area. Five crepe myrtle trees form a decorative semi-circle surrounding the marker. While the
marker commemorates the historic El Camino Real, it is not itself associated with this National
Historic Trail. The marker may be in the same location in which it was originally placed in 1918,
though is unknown when the fenced enclose was constructed or the crepe myrtle trees planted.
Typically, historical markers are not evaluated for their eligibility for designation as SALs, and the
marker is mentioned in this chapter largely because it was recorded as an archeological site in
2000 during a prior survey of a nearby water pipeline. The marker does not itself necessarily
represent a class of resource that is afforded protection under the Antiquities Code of Texas; as
such, the marker is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL. However, Horizon is
not aware of any plans to remove or move the marker in association with the current project, and
it is unlikely that the marker would be disturbed as a result of the proposed undertaking. That
being said, the marker likely could be moved elsewhere along the FM 622 roadway without losing
any of its historical context or setting. No further investigations are recommended on site
41HY287 in connection with the current project.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:

â¢

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

â¢

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.

â¢

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the project area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for designation as SALs.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR Â§60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by three requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the four criteria for eligibility listed
above, and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As
discussed here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory
and history according to various periods of development in various times and at various places.
Thus, the significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic
development and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular
period of development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding
of prehistory. All four criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought
to bear for historic sites.

7.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

H369-180258

57

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he siteâs archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.4

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

From April 1 to 5, 2019, Horizon archeologists Emily McCurdy, Jeffrey D. Owens,
Elizabeth Sefton, and Jared Wiersema conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the
project area. The survey was performed under the supervision of Jeffrey D. Owens, who served
as Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8831. The purpose of the survey
was to locate any significant cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
undertaking. Horizonâs archeologists traversed the project area on foot in parallel transects
spaced roughly 100.0 meters (328.1 feet) apart and thoroughly inspected the modern ground
surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The project area consists of an
extensive, open cattle pasture. Short pasture grasses covered the majority of the project area,
though the grass was quite short and patchy in most areas, affording good to excellent visibility
of the modern ground surface (60 to 100%). Ephemeral two-track field roads criss-cross the
project area, and several gravel roads provide access to different sections of the ranch. Extensive
trampling from cattle ranching was evident. Chert-bearing stream gravels ranging from small to
large in size are ubiquitous on the modern ground surface across the entire project area. Several
erosional cutbanks were observed within the project area that revealed a typical soil profile
consisting of a relatively shallow A horizon (apparently a former plowzone) underlain by extremely
dense gravel deposits, suggesting that the entire landform underlying the project area is a vast,
Pleistocene-age gravel bar. Many of the river gravels present within the project area are chertbearing, suggesting this area likely was a valuable source of lithic raw material throughout
prehistory. Similar sediment profiles were observed along the cutbanks of the unnamed stream
that flows through the project area. A large, artificial lake, the John F. Baugh Reservoir, occupies
an approximately 10.1-hectare (25.0-acre) area in the southwestern portion of the project area.
This lake was created by constructing an east-to-west-oriented earthen embankment across the
unnamed tributary. Several small boathouses are located along the edges of the dam. Numerous
small to moderate-sized stock ponds are also scattered throughout the project area.

500.0 Acres of the Riverbend Ranch Tract, San Marcos, Hays County, Texas

Disturbances within the project area have been extensive, including construction of the
John F. Baugh Reservoir and numerous smaller stock tanks, a network of ephemeral field roads,
and several more substantial gravel roads throughout the ranch. Historically, the ranch was
utilized primarily for crop agriculture until the 1970s, and agricultural terracing is extensive
throughout the project area. Cattle ranching operations beginning in the 1980s have resulted in
ongoing trampling of the modern ground surface.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the TSMASS require a minimum of one shovel test per
1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) within project areas exceeding 40.5 hectares (100.0 acres) in size. As
such, 167 shovel tests would be required within the approximately 202.3-hectare (500.0-acre)
project area. Horizon excavated a total of 247 shovel tests during the survey, thereby exceeding
the shovel testing requirements for a project area of this size. Shovel testing revealed shallow
deposits of dense, gravelly, dark grayish-brown to black clay loam containing abundant river
gravels. Shovel tests were typically terminated a depths ranging from 10.0 to 45.0 centimeters
(3.9 to 17.7 inches) below surface due to the density of the river gravels.
The survey resulted in the re-location and reinvestigation of two previously recorded
archeological sites present within the project areaâ41HY272 and 41HY287 (Table 3). Site
41HY272 consists of an aboriginal lithic scatter situated atop a prominent hill in the approximate
center of the project area. At the time it was originally recorded in 1995 by Timothy K. Pertulla,
this site was described as consisting of tested chert cobbles, lithic debitage, bifaces in various
stages of reduction, and a few expedient flake tools. The site was recorded during a cultural
resources survey sponsored directly by the THC, though the purpose of the survey is not specified
on the site form. Site 41HY287 consists of an El Camino Real historical marker erected by the
Daughters of the American Revolution in 1918. This marker was recorded as an archeological
site in 2000 in connection with an archeological survey conducted for a proposed GBRA raw water
pipeline project, though the site consists only of the historical marker and five crepe myrtle trees
planted in a semi-circle surrounding the marker. These two sites are recommended as ineligible
for designation as SALs, and no further investigations are recommended on either site.
Two additional previously recorded archeological sites within the project areaâ41HY288
and 41HY307)âwere not re-located or reinvestigated and appear to have been destroyed as a
result of construction activities associated with water pipeline projects undertaken within the past
20 years. Site 41HY288 was recorded in 2013 as a multiple-component site consisting of an
aboriginal campsite, represented by a scatter of burned rocks and lithic debitage, and an early
20th-century historic-age homestead or farmstead, represented by barbed wire fences, a utility
pole, a stock pond, and a scatter of porcelain and whiteware ceramic sherds and aqua, green,
and clear glass shards (though lacking any architectural features) located east of the intersection
of FM 266 (Old Bastrop Highway) and FM 621 (Staples Road). Site 41HY307 was recorded in
2000 as an aboriginal lithic scatter representing prehistoric lithic raw material procurement and
initial reduction activities located off the southern side of Rancho del Camino Real Railroad Road
(the private driveway that provides access to the Riverbend Ranch property).

Other recorded and unrecorded cultural resources are present nearby but beyond the
boundaries of the survey area associated with the proposed undertaking. Approximately
10 previously recorded archeological sites are located immediately beyond the boundaries of the
project area, but no evidence of any of these sites was observed within the project area during
the survey. Furthermore, a small cluster of historic-age structures and an isolated grave are
located along the private ranch driveway that provides access to the Riverbend Ranch tract.
These resources include the ca. 1870 Charles Lewis McGehee Cabin, a mid-20th-century house
occupied by the current ranch foreman, and the Clara McGehee Cemetery. The Clara McGehee
Cemetery consists of a single grave and headstone, that of Clara Lillian McGehee (born 1861;
died 1862), under a large live oak tree located near the abovementioned structures. There are
no indications of any additional graves on this small cemetery. All of these resources are located
outside of the boundaries of the current project area, and documenting these resources was
outside the scope of the current project.

7.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified within the project
area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends
a finding of âno historic properties affected,â and no further archeological work is recommended
in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and
historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human
remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or
ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should
cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be notified
immediately. Following completion of the project, all project records will be prepared for
permanent curation at TARL.
