Abstract
Flatrock Enginering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources linear survey of the YGrade to Equistar Pipeline right-of-way in both Nueces and San Patricio counties, Texas. The Area
of Potential Effect is 24.7 miles long x 100 feet wide, for a total of 299 acres. With the exception
of 350 meters of the right-of-way that will cross tracts of land owned by the City of Corpus
Christi, the remainder of the 24.7-mile right-of-way will cross publicly owned properties. The
entire project is privately funded, and thus no state Antiquities Permit was required for other than
the City of Corpus Christi tracts. The cultural resources survey of those City of Corpus Christi
tracts has been reported separately under Antiquities Permit #6451, and is referenced in this report.
Based upon the latest re-alignment, Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough
pedestrian survey and dug 33 shovel tests on November 1-4, 2012 and then on February 5 -7,
2013, resulting in the discovery of 41SP262, a scatter of artifacts in the drainage bottom of Rincon
Bayou in San Patricio County. Tierras Antiguas assessed the cultural material as in secondary
context, with little, if any research potential. Otherwise, the right-of-way will generally course
through upland areas with shallow soils, though cultivated fields, or though residential
neighborhoods.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the project should be considered as having “no
effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should
be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Introduction
TexStar Midstream
Services Limited
Partnership of San
Antonio, Texas is the lead
agency for the Y-Grade to
Equistar Pipeline that is
proposed for construction
in southern San Patricio
and northern Nueces
counties (Figures 1-7).
TexStar Midstream in turn
contracted with Flatrock
Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd. of
San Antonio to ensure the
requirements for
environmental and
cultural assessments
would be conducted in a
professional compliance
manner. At the request of
Flatrock, Tierras Antiguas
A r c h a e o l o g i c a l Figure 1. Location of the Project Area, and Nueces and San Patricio
counties in Texas.
Investigations (TAAI)
conducted a cultural
resources survey of the Project Area (PA) during the period November 1-4, 2012 and then on
February 5 -7, 2013 (Figures 1-7).
The project is privately funded, and all but 350 meters of the right-of-way will cross privately
owned properties; thus no antiquities permit was required for other than the 350 meters. For that
small portion of the right-of-way, TAAI obtained Antiquities Permit #6451 from the Texas
Historical Commission. No evidence of cultural material was found along that 350-meter stretch
(Nickels 2013).
The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). In addition to a surface survey of the 24.7-mile right-ofway, Tierras Antiguas excavated 33 shovel tests adjacent to river, stream, and bayou crossings.

Project Setting
Geology, Soils, and Hydrology
As shown in Figure 8, the Y-Grade to Equistar Pipeline will cross over and through four
geological formations.
Quaternary-aged Alluvium (Qal) is made up of clay, silt, sand, and gravels with abundant organic
material. These recent alluvial deposits are commonly found on point bars, natural levees, stream
channels, backswamps, coastal marshes, mud flats, clay dunes, sand dunes, and oyster reefs, and
terraces along stream channels in Nueces and San Patricio counties (Fisher 1975).

7

Beaumont Formation clays (QbC) and sands (Qbs) are Middle Pleistocene in age, and are
commonly found on barrier islands and beach formations, as well as along inland stream channels
(Fisher 1975).
Deweyville Formation sand, silt, clay, and gravels (Qd) are possibly Late Pleistocene in age.
Deweyville deposits are commonly found on point bars, natural levees, and both active and relict
stream channels in the near coastal areas of Texas. Typically, these deposits are extant along the
Nueces River up to 55 feet above sea level (Fisher 1975).

Figure 8. Geological map of the Project Area.
As shown in Figures 9-15, the Y-Grade to Equistar Pipeline will dissect 21 different soil types that
offer varying depths, resulting primarily from alluvial processes related to the Nueces River, as
well as tidal deposits from the Gulf of Mexico. As such, these various soil classifications
otherwise imply the potential for the preservation of intact cultural resources to exist (Guckian and
Garcia 1979; Websoil Survey 2013). Typical soil pedons of these nine classifications are
synthesized following Figures 9-15.

Elevations, Rivers, and Streams
The low elevations in San Patricio and Nueces counties range from sea level along the Gulf of
Mexico shoreline, up to 200 feet above sea level in the western portions of the counties where the
coastal plains give way to rolling caliche hills. Southeasterly flowing rivers and creeks include the
Aransas and Nueces rivers, and Chiltipin, Oso, San Fernando, and Petronila creeks (Guthrie
1996a; Long 1996). Hurricane storm surges have frequently inundated the low coastal areas as
well as areas further inland along the Nueces River and Rincon Bayou (Map 2013).

Flora, Fauna, and Climate
The Project Area lies within the Coastal Prairie physiographic region of Texas (Figure 16). The
region is made up of a complex of marshes, upland grassland, and some forested habitat. Along
riverine environs are primarily large elms and oaks, along with some relict sabal palms, and
thornscrub. Otherwise, mesquite, huisache, tall prairie grasses, and prickly pear cacti are common.
The regional flora area has been classified as being part of the Tamaulipan biotic province
extending out from northeast Mexico (Figure 17). This is the only part of Texas where some
vegetation exhibits growth throughout the year (Blair 1950). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent occurrence, with a mix of woody and grassland
species providing a savanna environment during prehistoric times (Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis
1964).
The original vegetation was an open grassland mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and ash
were common along perennial streams. Due in part to overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the
invasion of woody species has changed the vegetation into “Texas brush country” dominated by

17

mesquite, acacia, spiny hackberry, brazil,
whitebrush, lotebrush, and others
(Diamond et al. 1987:203-221). On sandy
soils, the brush includes mesquite with
mixed grasses. In contrast, clay soils
support mesquite (Proposis juliflora),
various species of Acacia, and mimosa,
granjeno or desert hackberry (Celtis
pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera
angustifolia, lindheeimeri), tasajillo
(Opuntia leptocaulis), and species of
Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).
Modern vegetation in San Patricio and
Nueces counties includes cordgrasses,
salt grasses, marsh millet, tall grasses,
oak, acacias, mesquite, and prickly pear
(Guthrie 1996a; Long 1996).
Modern wildlife includes deer, javelina,
rabbits, raccoons, coyotes, bobcat, quail,
muskrat, beaver, mink, ring-tailed cat,
badger, fox, turkey, duck, geese,
jacksnipe, sandhill crane, and whooping Figure 16. Physiographic regions of Texas

two counties is just over 30 inches. The
average low temperature is just over 46
degrees in January, the average high
temperature is 93 degrees in July, and the
average numer of growing season days is
306. Overall, the climate can be classified
as humid subtropical (Guthrie 1996a;
Long 1996).

Cultural Context and
Chronology
The Project Area lies within the Central
Texas Coast archaeological region as
refined by Ricklis (2004). All dates are
given as approximate years before
present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.

Figure 17. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.

18

Paleoindian (11,000 - 7500 B.P.)
Although some Paleoindian artifacts have been found, no intact paleoindian components have
been found in the Central Texas Coast region, so that a chronology of the Paleoindian period or
stage cannot be adequately defined (Ricklis 2004). Exasterbating the discovery of intact
components is due in part to the rising sea level along the coast since Paleoindian campsites were
occupied; those campsites are presumably under water, far east of today’s shoreline. Ricklis
surmises that if buried and intact Paleoindian components are discovered, they will be in today’s
riverine environments away from the modern Gulf of Mexico shoreline.
Early Archaic (7500 - 4200 B.P.)
Two sub-periods are recognized during the 3,300-year Early Archaic period along the Central
Texas Coast. The earlier sub-period ranges from about 7500 to 6800 B.P., and is based upon
radiocarbon dates from shoreline archaeological sites in the Nueces Bay area. Sites during this
period are predominantly oyster shell middens situated on upland margins overlooking the bay.
These middens are the result of exploitation of oysters as a food source, but more often than not
few artifacts have been found. Those chipped stone pieces that have been found resemble Central
and South Texas, Uvalde and Gower dart points. Worked shell pieces include flaked sunray venus
clamshell scrapers and knives. Faunal remains are mostly non-existant at these sites, but that could
be due to the relative rapid disintegration of bone in the silty soils. Otherwise, only a few of the
more resiliant fish otoloiths have been found, suggesting that the occupants of the shoreline at this
time relied heavily on shellfish as their primary food source.
A valid archaeological record for the next circa 1,000 years is largely unknown. However, the later
sub-period of Early Archaic shoreline occupation sites date to around 5800-4200 B.P. Ricklis sites
radiocarbon data from 15 site components dating to this period. Cultural manifestations during this
sub-period are primarily oyster shell lenses, with occasional fish otoloiths and chert flakes.
However, one site (41NU221 - McKinzie Site) yielded a relatively thick shell midden, along with
hundreds of chert flakes, two Bell points, a Tortugas point, and two modified shells. Triangular
dart points have also been found on the surface at the Maens Site (41NU184) in Nueces County.
Potential evidence of an Early Archaic structure in the form of post molds were also documented
at 41NU184 (Ricklis and Gunter 1986). Although animal bones are not generally found at these
sites, the presence of chipped stone dart points and scrapers suggest that hunting must have been
very much a part of the subsistence base. Seasonally, data retrieved from oyster shells and fish
otoliths indicate that shellfish were most likely exploited in the winter through early spring, and
fish were trapped or caught in the fall and early spring. Although Ricklis (2004) surmises that
based upon the number of sites discovered, human populations may have increased during this
later sub-period, he cautions that the number of sites that could have existed during the earlier subperiod may well have been destroyed and removed by a dynamically eroding landscape.
Middle Archaic (4200 - 3100 B.P.)
This period is poorly dated, and may reflect a hiatus in Gulf shoreline occupation between 4200
and 3100 B.P. Ricklis (2004) opines that the numerous midden shell deposits that were present
during the Early Archaic and Late Archic, are either absent during the Middle Archaic, or are most
certainly few in number. Environmentally, the relative absence could be attributed to a rapid sea
level rise and highstand during the Middle Archaic. Much more effort needs to be exerted to find
19

and research Middle Archaic components before this period can begin to be more clearly
understood.
Late Archaic (3100 - 950 B.P.)
Roughly 3,000 years ago, the sea level in the Gulf of Mexico stabilized to what we see it today.
Much like Central Texas, the archaeological sites along the Central Texas Gulf Coast are larger
than during the Early Archaic, the middens at these sites are thicker, and there are a relatively
wider variety of tools being were being produced and utilized. These data strongly suggest that
populations increased significantly, and sites were likely occupied for longer periods of time.
Concurrent with the stabilized shoreline, and in effect the biotic production offered in coastal
estuaries, gathering shellfish became a very important food source, but supplemented with fish and
white-tailed deer. Around the middle of the Late Archaic, ca. 2,000 years ago, fishing became very
much an important part of the subsistence base. One of the more important Late Archaic
archaeological sites investigated is the Kent-Crane site (41AS3). It is situated on a shoreline bluff
above Copano Bay, was likely occupied as early as about 2,700 years ago, and extends for roughly
1,000 meters along the bluff. The intensive occupation at Kent-Crane is manifested by a sea shell
midden as much as 1.8-meters thick.
A second significant archaeological site in the Central Texas Gulf Coastal area that represents a
Late Archaic occupation period is the Mustang Lake site (41CL3). Once again, this site was
occupied during a period of apparent sea level stabilization very similar to today’s level. The first
occupations at the Mustang Lake site appear to be temporally co-eval with those at the Kent-Crane
site. Once again, there are dense layers of oyster shells, along with bone, and chipped stone. In the
upper-most portion of these midden layers, archaeologists found sandy-paste pottery sherds. Other
significantly important Central Texas Gulf Coastal, Late Archaic sites investigated at Ingleside
Cove on the northeastern shore of Corpus Christi Bay include 41SP43 and 41SP120.
Late Prehistoric (950 - 250 B.P. [A.D. 1000 - 1700])
Along the Central Texas Coast area, a marked change in stone tools, the transition from the
shoulder-thrown atlatl to the bow and arrow as a more accurate and deadly killing weapon, and
the production of clay vessels for storage and cooking occurred around 950 B.P. (A.D. 10001700). Ricklis (2004) divides the Central Texas Coast Late Prehistoric period into two subperiods, the Initial Late Prehistoric and the Final Late Prehistoric.
Initial Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1000-1250/1300)
A robust Initial Late Prehistoric occupation excavated at 41SP120 dates to between A.D. 1022 and
1209. Fish consumption was prolific, with human dietary needs supplemented by the hunting and
consumption of deer. Arrow points recovered at 41SP120 included triangular, Fresno-like
specimens. Further north within the coastal area, Scallorn arrow points have been found in
association with plain, sandy-paste pottery sherds. Although sandy-paste pottery appears to have
been manufactured during the earlier part of this sub-period, there is evidence to suggest that
decorated wares such as Rockport Black-on-Gray were a result of evolving pottery manufacturing
and design during the later centuries.

20

Final Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1250/1300 - 1700)
As with much of the rest of what we now know as Texas, the archaeological record in the Central
Texas Coast area reveals that the variety of chipped stone tools increased dramatically, and the
manufacturing of ceramic vessels in terms of quality, shape, and style changed significantly. These
changes demonstrated a marked advancement in tool production, and food storage and cooking
manufacturing technology, and further infer substantial changes in subsistence choices and mobility
patterns that occurred during this roughly 450-year period.
Chipped stone tools include smaller and presumably stream-lined arrow points such as the Perdiz
type, small unifacially flaked end scrapers, bifacially flaked knives, drills, and small prismatic
blades removed from blade cores. Pottery sherds found at period sites include those from bowls,
jars, and ollas which have been coated or decorated with asphaltum, and may have incised designs,
and even ceramic smoking pipes. Pottery types during the Final Late Prehistoric are named as
Rockport Incised, Rockport Crenelated, and Rockport Black-on-Gray; otherwise referred to as the
“Rockport Phase”. Remains found at Rockport Phase sites suggest the reliance of fish as a food
source probably reached its peak in prehistory, while the reliance on shellfish was largely
overshadowed.
There appears to be a non-discrete boundary between sites located close to the Gulf Coast
compared to those located roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) inland. At about that imaginary line,
Rockport pottery typical of shoreline occupations wanes, whereas bone-tempered pottery so typical
of Late Prehistoric Toyah occupations (e.g., Collins 2004; Hester 2004; Hester and Parker 1970;
Black 1986) tends to be prevalent. It was during the latter part of this Final Late Prehistoric subperiod when the bison became so much a predominate part of Toyah occupation, that the reliance
on bison herds also penetrated the imaginary 40-kilometer line west of the Gulf Coast, along the
riverine environs leading to the coast. For example, at the Mellon site (41RF21) in Refugio County,
bison and deer bones were found in association with Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points, and
Rockport pottery sherds.
Historic (ca. A.D. 1700-Present)
Although the coast of the Gulf of Mexico was charted by Spanish Captain Alonso Alvarez de
Pineda in 1520, perhaps the earliest white men to see this land area of Texas were Alvar Nuñez
Cabeza de Vaca, and two or three of his shipwrecked companions. De Vaca traversed parts of
southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the huntergatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). His stay with the Miriami in
1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves to the easily
exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending a hunting
party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near each other in
the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other succulents (Campbell
and Campbell 1981:13-37). In addition, his diary speaks extensively of the ways of the Karankawa
Indians, a nomadic tribe that favored the modern site of the community of Refugio as a campsite
and eventual permanent village (Leffler 1996).
In 1722, the faithful Catholic fathers, with support from the Spanish Crown, established Mission
Señora del Espiritu Santo de Zúñiga in Goliad in an attempt to Christianize and otherwise
21

domesticate the Karankawas. Later, in 1793, Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio was founded at
the confluence of the Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers (Leffler 1996). However, Indian
depredations caused the location of this mission to be moved twice; the final site to be on the
Mission River in what is now modern-day Refugio. In 1830, the mission was closed, but by that time
Mexican ranchos surrounded the area.
In the early 1830s, colonists from Ireland, New York, and New Orleans were enticed to settle in the
area under empressario land contracts. During the Texas Revolution in 1835, residents of the area
were forced to flee to the east during the “Runaway Scrape”, and the Mexican town of La Bahia was
nearly destroyed.
Following the Civil War, the area’s economy was bolstered by cattle ranching and corn farming.
However, by 1900 the cattle industry had declined significantly. With the coming of railways in the
early 1900s, and a renewed cotton demand, cotton became the most predominate cash crop. In the
1920s, oil and gas were discovered in the area, and although somewhat diminished by the Great
Depression, production of oil and gas in the area has been a mainstay, and today is on a springboard
driving the economy of San Patricio and Nueces counties.

Site Types to be Expected Along the Pipeline
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Nueces and San Patricio counties are prehistoric open
campsites ranging in age from the late Paleoindian period through the Historic period. Some of these
represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped for
one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of people
that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these same
campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these large
campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing multiple
hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from making them,
ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and aquatic
animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites occur
in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine environment that offered a wide
variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water sources.
Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different food source that could be exploited
such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts.
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
22

look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are not a real common type of archaeological site that can be expected along the YGrade to Equitar Pipeline. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools
that were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The
general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites
suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time ( However,
small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more
knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings or
surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of
chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes removed,
called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality of stone that
could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to
judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the cobble was
tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality,
coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away from these sites,
what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces
of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large
cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides,
reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make
finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not found
on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where raw
material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use, so they
are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found on
any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops that
were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried today, and
the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and lithic scatters in the Nueces
and San Patricio County areas have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the
eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but differ
from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at times they
specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were not yet freed
from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types of sites are very rare
in the Central Texas Coast region for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not
present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up
gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone
remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well
as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
23

Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no documented of burned rock middens in either Nueces or San Patricio counties. Burned
rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like
modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger
rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a
thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable,
another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched
out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion
of the formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented at 32 sites within Nueces and
Refugio counties and are occasionally found elsewhere in the Central Texas Coast region. Individual
and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both upland and coastal
settings, as well as in alluvial terraces along streams.
Shell Middens
As discussed in the “Cultural Chronology” section above, within an approximate 40-kilometer (25mile) zone from the modern Gulf Coast shoreline, archaeologists should expect to discover
prehistoric campsites where shellfish were exploited in abundance as a food source. As a result, the
thousands, or hundreds-of-thousands of shells were discarded, and over repeated usage, these sites
can be identified by layers of shell refuse sometimes as much as 1 to 2 meters in accumulated depth.
Although these refuse middens are more often than not directly associated with relative long-term
open campsites with campfire remains, bone, pottery, and chipped stone, because of the vast
accumulation of shell debris, archaeologists have tended to describe the overall site as a “shell
midden site”.
Historic Sites
Early explorers ventured into the area beginning in the 1500s, both the French and Spanish
established permanent structures in the region in the 17th and 18th centuries, and Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in the area by the early 19th century. Historic sites are not abundant,
but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to ranching and
farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types most commonly
include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation remains from both
main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial or cemetery, school
houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or construction projects.

Nueces County History
Based upon artifacts discovered in Nueces County, it appears that humans may have occupied this
area as early as 8,000 years ago. Following that, the earliest known campsites indicating more stable
and permanent occupations can be dated to what is termed the Aransas culture, beginning roughly
4,000 years ago. The Aransas culture gave way to the Karankawas, about 1400 A.D. As in San
24

Patricio County, Karankawas, Coahuiltecans, Lipan Apaches, and Tonkawas were those first
encountered by Europeans explorers and settlers in the 16th and 17th centuries. As with much of
Texas, European contact with the indigenous groups in Nueces County resulted in decimation of the
Native Americans due to disease, mixing among defined bands, tribes, and cultures, effectively
eliminating previously existing discrete and distinct groups (Long 1996).
The first European contact with the indigenous peoples of Nueces County ‘may’ have been made
by members of Alonso Álvarez de Pineda’s expedition as the Spanish sailed into Corpus Christi Bay
in 1519. Perhaps the most researched and published Spanish venture into what is now Nueces
County occurred in 1528 when Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his fellow crew members were
shipwrecked on the Texas coast. It is probable that de Vaca and his captors traveled through Nueces
County as they rounded the coastal inlands of Corpus Christi Bay. Presumably because of its
remoteness from inhabited Spanish holdings in what today is northern Mexico, the Nueces County
area was not of a matter of interest until the Spanish learned of a French presence, and the
establishment of a French colony and fort in the region in 1685 under René Robert Cavelier, Sieur
de La Salle (Fort La Salle). Upon learning of the French encroachment into Spanish territory,
Governor Alonso de León led an expedition to the fort but found it burned and abandoned. In 1747,
Captain Joaquin Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra departed from Presidio La Bahia at present-day
Goliad and explored the Nueces River to its mouth on Nueces Bay (Long 1996).
Under Spanish rule, large tracts of land were granted and ranching gained a foothold until 1812
when the Indians began raiding and pillaging. These depredations continued through 1824 when
a peace treaty was finally signed with the Comanches and Lipan Apaches. Under subsequent
Mexican rule, other large tracts of lands were again granted. Turmoil during the Texas Revolution
caused many landowners to flee the area, and following the revolution, both Texan and Mexican
raiding parties were at conflict within the county. At this time, both countries laid claim to the area
south and west of the Nueces River. In the meantime, illegal trading was prevalent within this
disputed territory, and the area’s ranches were virtually abandoned until after the Mexican War in
1845. During the Civil War, Corpus Christi emerged as a nucleus for Confederate trade. But Union
troops seized control of Mustang island in 1863, and bombarded Corpus Christi. Nevertheless,
unsanctioned trade goods were traveled via overland routes along the coast (Long 1996).
Following the Civil War, ranches with cattle, horses, and sheep bolstered the progressive economy
in Nueces County. In fact, Nueces County lead all other counties in Texas in the number of sheep
and cattle being raised, and the human population increased exponentially. In 1874, the Corpus
Christi sea channel was dredged to eight feet to allow for steamers to pass through it, and about the
same time a narrow-gauge rail line was constructed from Corpus Christi to Laredo. Another rail line,
the San Antonio and Aransas Pass, was completed in 1886 from Corpus Christi to San Antonio.
Cotton was the main cash crop through the early 20th century, but with large quantities of cabbage,
onions, spinach, carrots, cucumbers, and turnips being grown. In 1926 the Port of Corpus Christi
was opened. Cotton production waned through the 1940s, but peaked again in the late 1940s. As
with many counties in Texas, the discovery of oil and natural gas in Nueces County in the 1920s has
provided a generally stable economic stimuli. This stimuli is now peaking in the first quarter of the
21st century.

25

San Patricio County History
Artifacts found in San Patricio County suggest that the area has been occupied for at least the past
6,000 years. Around A.D. 1400, the Karankawa Indians inhabited the area, and written historic
accounts reveal that the Karankawas, Coahuiltecans, Lipan Apaches, and Tonkawas were
encountered by Europeans explorers and settlers. The earliest known explorer was Alonso Álvarez
de Pineda, a Spaniard who in 1519 sailed into the bays behind Aransas Pass. In 1689 and again in
1691, Spaniard Alonso de León sailed along the coast, exploring the bays. Frenchmen sailors landed
on St. Joseph Island in 1712, and again in 1718. The interior of San Patricio County was later
penetrated by Spaniard Ortiz Parrilla. In 1828, the Mexican government granted 80 leagues of land
in the area to empresarios John McMullen and James McGloin provided they would settle 200 Irish
catholic families on the land. The first families arrived in 1829, and established the town of San
Patricio de Hibernia on the north side of the Nueces River (Guthrie 1996a).
The Texas Revolutionary War brought turmoil to San Patricio County, as it did with most of Texas.
In 1835, a company of volunteer militia from the McMullen and McGloin Colony captured Fort
Lipantitlán, a Mexican fort built in 1833 to restrict Anglo immigration into Texas (Guthrie 1996b).
Most colonists were forced to evacuate the area due to the war, and even following the war, the
Mexican army continued raids into the area as late as 1842. As a result the county was depopulated
except for the soldiers, a few traders, and a few adventurers who dared pass through. General
Zachary’s army stabilized the area in 1845, and by 1850 settlers began moving back into San
Patricio County. Cattle and sheep were the main livestock raised in the 1850s, and local farmers
raised corn, sweet potatoes, potatoes, beans, and peas. During the Civil War the “Cotton Road”
which ran through the county became a major smuggling route to Matamoras County. Both
Confederate and Union forces were present in the county. The Confederacy built a fort at Aransas
Pass, the Union sent ships to the area in an attempt to stem the smuggling, and Union sailors landed
near Ingleside, burning houses and confiscating livestock (Guthrie 1996a).
Following the considerable disruption during the Civil War, earlier settlers again began returning
to San Patricio County. The land was cheap, and new immigrants returning from the war found the
area a desirable place to live and raise crops. By 1870, there were 602 people living in the county,
roughly 52,000 acres were being farmed, and corn was the major cash crop. In 1896, the St. Louis,
Brownsville and Mexico Railway was routed through the county, and Rockport was envisioned as
a major deep-water port on the Gulf of Mexico. The discovery of oil and gas deposits in the early
1900s further caused land prices to rise, as the local economy diversified from a predominantly
farming base. By the 1980s, large industries were fully operational along the bayfront, and shrimp
and other seafoods were exported in large quantities. Although, the oil and gas boom experienced
in the county waned significantly in the 1970s, the county is currently once again experiencing a
boom in these industries (Guthrie 1996a).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within each of the two counties, the results simply provide the data that is available.
26

In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the
types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. That said, the data that is
available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the areas of the near coastal areas of Texas that the
surveys represent. Most of the near coastal areas of exas have never been subjected to formal
cultural resource surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is
very poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least
some aspect of what the region looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Nueces County
As of February 12, 2013 there were 321 archaeological sites recorded in Nueces County. Of those,
229 are described as prehistoric open campsites, ranging in age from the Paleoindian through Late
Prehistoric periods. Shell middens are present on 26 of the 229 open campsites, and human burial
remains have been found at 31 of the campsites. In addition, there are five shell middens, and four
sites with human remains that are not directly associated with open campsites. Lithic scatters are
fairly rare in Nueces County, probably in part due to the paucity of quality raw material in the area.
To date, there have been only 18 archaeological sites that can be classified as lithic scatters. Nueces
County is blessed with an abundance of historical components - 43 recorded thus far. These include
an early 19th century river crossing of the El Camino Real, a Spanish Colonial ranch headquarters,
General Zachary’s camp dating to 1845, an 1800s school house site, Mexican-era sites, and early
to mid-20th century farmsteads and trash scatters, as well as many others. State Archeological
Landmarks documented within the county include 27 shipwrecks, the Fort Lipantitlan and MexicanTexan site, the Oso Lake Midden site with human burials, the San Antonio and Aransas canal and
causeway, the Old Bayview Cemetery, the Nueces County Courthouse in Corpus Christi, and a
variety of other very interesting sites (Atlas 2013).
San Patricio County
As of February 12, 2013 there were 252 archaeological sites recorded in San Patricio County. Of
those, 170 are described as prehistoric open campsites, ranging in age from the late Paleoindian
through Late Prehistoric periods. A few of those Late Prehistoric sites also exhibit very early EuroAmerican artifacts, suggesting they span into a transitional period what Hester (2004) would term
as the Protohistoric. Notably, there are 65 archaeological sites where oyster shell middens make up
the bulk of the features, and these shell middens are the predominant feature on over 29% (50 of
170) of the open campsites. There are 32 archaeological sites classified as prehistoric lithic scatters
or procurement sites where broken stone tools, tested cobbles, cores, and debitage are present.
Human burials have been found at eight sites in the county. Although seven of the eight are
prehistoric in age, skeletal remains of a single individual found at one site may have been a victim
of the hurricane that devastated the Gulf Coast in 1919. Historic components have been documented
at 34 sites. These range in age from the very earliest presence of Anglo Americans in the county,
to established farmsteads and cemeteries through the 1950s. Among the many examples of historic
sites are the ghost town of Angelita, a Spanish Colonial and Republic of Texas road, trash scatters
with musket balls and bottle glass, early ranching and farmstead buildings, and Civilian
Conservation Corps structures. The only State Archeological Landmark listed in San Patricio
County is a wreck of the ship “Dayton” (Atlas 2013).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework
is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the regions.
The historic framework is structured around the 1800s and 1900s settlement in the area as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests, government representatives, and
early Anglo-American settlers, through the Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty periods, and
into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences adjacent to the ROW were to be documented
with photographs and included in this report of investigations.
All shovel tests were dug in 20-centimeter (cm) levels, and all sediments were screened through 1/4inch wire mesh. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered from shovel tests
were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 20 cm of the backfilled shovel test. The
results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, and the results are
summarized in Table A-1, Appendix A.
The lone archaeological site discovered (41SP262) was mapped using a pace-and-compass method,
as well as a GPS. Field notes were made about the site and a sketch map was drawn. Digital
photographs of the site and selected artifacts were taken, as well as selected photographs
representing the surveyed right-of-way in general, and a photo log was maintained.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
Typically, sandy clay and clay soils with fragmented limestone caliche were encountered in the
upland, northern portion of the ROW, while expected deeper clay loams were present along the
lower portion. An exception was in the area of Shovel Tests 50 and 51, where deep sugar sand was
encountered on the slope south of the concrete channeled drainage (see Figures 10 and 12). Notably,
that slope had been artificially terraced for farming sometime in the not too distant past.
No historic cultural material was observed either on the surface, in any of the 33 shovel tests
excavated, or in any of the numerous pig ruts and other animal borrows examined. The only
evidence of prehistoric materials observed either within or adjacent to the right-of-ways was on site
41SP262, described below.

ephemeral and subtle
erosional swills in the bottom of the bayou’s channel strongly suggests that the cultural and noncultural materials present have been washed from some unknown locale to the east. Six shovel tests
placed on the surface of the adjacent terrace revealed no evidence of cultural material (see Figure
27 and Table A-1), but the results of shovel testing as well as the extremely hummocky surface did
suggest that the immediate area had been subjected to repeated episodes of flooding and washing.
Artifacts observed within the drainage included small, widely dispersed fire cracked rocks, middle
and late stage bifacial manufacturing flakes, and a crude bifacial scraper, all manufactured from
fine-grained chert (see for example, Figure 25). Although scattered oyster shells and Rabdotus shells
were mixed within the assemblage, none appeared to exhibit evidence of cultural alteration.
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
It appears that the artifacts at this location have been washed downstream from an undetermined
area, and all are in secondary context. If any part of the actual site still exists, it may lie to the east,
some 100 meters or more. Regardless, this area along Rincon Bayou would have been an ideal
location for prehistoric inhabitants to exploit both marine and terrestrial resources. Without the
discovery of diagnostics, the period (or periods) of occupation along this area of the bayou remains
an unknown.
In sum, the portion of the site that will be impacted by construction of the Y-Grade to Equistar
Pipeline consists of secondarily deposited artifacts. Other than its positioning on the landscape, in
its current heavily disturbed condition, we assess the research value of the portion of the site that
lies within the Y-Grade to Equistar Pipeline right-of-way as minimal at best. In view of this, Tierras

33

Antiguas recommends that construction of the Y-Grade to Equistar Pipeline as planned be allowed
to proceed through the site, with no further investigations.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100% pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to >95% visibility was conducted, along
with the excavation of 33 shovel tests. The only evidence of cultural material observed either on,
or below the surface was on Site 41SP262, where all cultural material within the pipeline right-ofway appears to be in secondary context, and as such is assessed as non-significant. As such, Tierras
Antiguas recommends that construction of the Y-Grade to Equistar Pipeline should be allowed to
proceed as currently designed. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any
properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or
inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be allowed
to proceed without further archaeological work.
However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction of the Y-Grade to Equistar
Pipeline, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
