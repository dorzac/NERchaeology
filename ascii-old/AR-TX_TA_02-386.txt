Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the
2.88-mile Locke Lateral, to be installed by Williams Energy in north-central McMullen County,
Texas. The project was entirely privately funded, and the properties across which the pipeline
will cross are privately owned; therefore, no Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
A full pedestrian field survey was conducted by two archaeologists on June 7, 2016. Surface
visibility along the proposed right-of-way varied from 70 to 100-percent. Although the right-ofway courses either through or adjacent to seven previously recorded archaeological sites, no
evidence of cultural material was observed within the proposed Locke Lateral right-of-way.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Locke Lateral be allowed
to proceed as it is currently planned, with no further archaeological investigations. However,
Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any undiscovered cultural resources are encountered
during development along the lateral extension, such finds should be examined and evaluated
by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
No artifacts were collected or curated.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly three individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed
to the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Ms. Judy
Desmond, Project Manager at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, and Mr. Ronnie
Glenewinkel and Mr. David Black, Environmental Coordinator and Permitting Specialist at
Williams Energy. All were extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their
overall knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s
scope of work.
In addition, we express our sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologist Belisario
Silva, who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured the
survey was conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Introduction
Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd., requested
a cultural resources background
review, with a subsequent field
survey of the proposed 2.88mile Locke Lateral in northcentral McMullen County, to
be developed by Williams
Energy, and
hereinafter
occasionally referred to as the
Project Area (PA) (Figures 13). Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations
(TAAI) archaeologists
conducted the field survey
along the right-of-way on June
7, 2016.

McMullen

located in
south-central
Texas mid-way
between the
Gulf of Mexico
to the east, and
the Rio Grande
to the west (see

about 330-390 feet above mean sea level. Clayey and loamy soils support the growth of small
predominately mesquite trees, and thorny scrub brush with assorted cacti, chaparral, and grassy
understory.
With its semi-arid environment, the counties are generally frost free from mid-February through
early December, allowing for a 290-day growing season. The average annual rainfall is about 24
inches. However, rainfall amounts vary significantly from year to year, and the high
evapotranspiration effects in the area effectively offset any beneficial surplus of annual rainfall.
This is another reason irrigation systems are so necessary, and commonly found in use today
throughout the area. Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently hovering
above 980F, although humidity is generally low compared to environments closer to the Gulf
Coast. Overall, the area’s climate can be classified as subtropical steppe (Leffler 1996).
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande are the major southeasterly trending rivers draining the
South Texas region. A subtle divide through the county causes numerous intermittent creeks to
flow south into the Nueces River, and others to drain toward the north, and into the Frio River.
2

Many drainages intermittently flow into
both rivers during infrequent seasonal
periods of abundant rainfall. Although
there are many springs in the area, very
few are active due primarily to the dip
of the substrate shales which carry these
subterranean seeps to the south and
east. Ancient springs that may have
existed in the area at one time have
likely succumbed to overgrazing and
irrigation pumping during modern times
(Brune 1981).
Flora and Fauna
The Project Area lies within the South
Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation
area as defined by Gould (1975), and
the regional flora of South Texas has
been classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending
out from northeast Mexico (Figures 4
and 5). This is the only part of Texas
where some vegetation exhibits growth Figure 4. Physiographic regions of Texas
throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg).
2016). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively
recent occurrence, with a mix of woody
and grassland species providing a
savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989;
Hester 1980; Inglis 1964). The original
vegetation was an open grassland
mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks,
pecan, and ash were common along
perennial streams. Due in part to
overgrazing and the exclusion of fire,
the invasion of woody species has
changed the vegetation into “Texas
brush country” dominated by mesquite,
acacia, spiny hackberry, brazil,
whitebrush, lotebrush, and others
(Diamond et al. 1987:203-221).
On sandy soils, the brush includes

Figure 5. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.

mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast, clay soils support mesquite (Proposis juliflora),
various species of Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), lignum
vitae (Porliera angustifolia), cenizo (Leucophyllum texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana),
prickly pear (Opuntia lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), and species of Condalia and
Castela (Blair 1950).The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits some of the greatest
mammalian species diversity in the state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards,
and several species of turtles, salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950).
Approximately 50 species of fish have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years
ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years. It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the
past few thousand years in the area that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The
greater changes have been induced by human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas
along the river and streams for construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which
has lowered water tables, and overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps,
springs, and streams in the area, they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter
intervals than exist at the present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Locke Lateral lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by Hester (1980,
1995, 2004; Figure 6). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due to the
compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated
within the region. Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of information that exists for
south Texas and as such offers only a “general framework” for prehistoric periods particular to
the region (Figure 6). All dates are given as approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before
1950.

4

Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of
Clovis-type points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no
camp sites or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting
was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as
deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked
rock cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic
groups were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are
thinly distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low
during the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
“few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization
5

of a wide range of resources,
especially such year-round
resources as prickly pear and
lechugilla, as well as rodents,
rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350
B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441)
suggests that the period
between 4450 and 2350 B.P.
reflects the Middle Archaic in
south Texas. The Middle
Archaic appears to have been a
time of increased population,
based on the large number of
sites from this period (Story
1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128).
On the South Texas Plains,
exploitation of widely scattered,
year-round resources such as
prickly pear continued
(Campbell and Campbell
1981:13–15), as did hunting
deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the
Early Archaic now began to
coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into
larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest
(Weir 1976:126). Many
researchers believe burned rock
middens are a result of this
endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt
1991; Weir 1976). The
common presence of deer
remains in burned rock
middens encourages the view
that deer processing took place
at burned rock midden sites. Figure 6. South Texas Archaeological region cultural

archaeological sites in south Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the
Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974). Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period,
suggesting a movement toward less mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest
occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County,
which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner et al. (2011) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period
during the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is
represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap
the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this
marked a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and
bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw
1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not
disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
7

Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a
nonstandard manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the
ones that best suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core
reduction and the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology
is a continent-wide phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah
assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
8

Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans
were rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

McMullen County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in McMullen County indicate that the area has been occupied for about
11,000 years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land
hospitable. Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed
rabbitskin robes, and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly
increased the deadliness of their spears (Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they
learned to make pottery and to hunt with bows and arrows. During the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, the Coahuiltecan Indians native to McMullen County were squeezed out
by other Indian who were migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from
the south. Many of the Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and
Comanches moved in to take their place (Leffler 1996).
“In the earliest of written accounts, no permanent Spanish settlements seem to have been
established in the area now known as McMullen County. In 1828, the land was assigned to John
McMullen and James McGloin, who contracted to settle the area with 200 Catholic immigrants.
By 1835 the Mexican government had issued perhaps fifteen grants of land in the area of present
McMullen County to colonists associated with the McMullen-McGloin project. None of these
grantees actually settled on the land assigned to them, however. By 1836, when Texas seceded
from Mexico, the area remained populated almost entirely by the Indian bands that roamed
through the area.
When William Bollaert, an English land speculator, traveled through the area between the
9

Nueces and Frio rivers in 1844, for example, the only people he encountered were convicts who
had escaped from a prison in Laredo. Even after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo definitively
assigned the Nueces Strip to Texas, outlaws and unfriendly Indians delayed development of the
area for years. By 1860, there were perhaps 100 settlers in the county. By the late 1860s and
early 1870s, a number of ranches had been established, mostly in the northern part of the county.
For protection, ranchers often grouped their dwellings together” (Leffler 1996).
Prehistoric Site Potential
Without written or oral accounts before the 1700s, it is difficult or impossible to truly say what
bands or tribes were within the modern political boundary of McMullen County before then.
Only cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and
apparent lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods.
Archaeologists have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites, including large
open campsites that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces with numerous
campfires, where a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered
animal remains are found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or on higher
terrain where more ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can expect
stone chipping stations, or prehistoric quarries.
Historic Site Potential
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the McMullen
county area, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
traversed parts of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling
among the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Covey 1961). His account of
his experiences in 1533–34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether
themselves to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter, and summer,
occasionally sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many
groups would live near each other in the semiarid environs of south Texas to harvest prickly pear
pads and other succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–37).
It was not until about 1865, that the surrounding frontier hinterlands that are now politically
known as Atascosa and Mc Mullen counties were considered safe enough for white settlers to
begin establishing smaller ranches and farmlands without complete annihilation by the many
roving bands of angry Comanche raiders from the north, as well as other displaced Native
American groups (Leffler 1996). In sum, there may be rare and isolated occurrences of early
ranching activities along the Locke Lateral, but the expectations of encountering any
archaeological site of significance from the 1500s through the mid-1900s along the lateral was
minimal.

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review

The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the Project Area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.
Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within the county, the results simply provide the data that is available. In reality, the
number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the types of
cultural resource surveys, and the areas of those surveys. That said, the data that is available on
the Texas Atlas is only as good as the areas of south Texas that the surveys represent. Most of
south Texas has never been subjected to formal cultural resource surveys, so it is conceded that
the true character of the archaeological record is very poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few
surveys that have been accomplished provide at least some aspect of what the region looks like
from an archaeological perspective.
McMullen County
As of May 19, 2016 there were 672 documented archaeological sites in McMullen County. Of
those, 456 are prehistoric open campsites with evidence that as a whole, open campsites in the
county have been occupied from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods. As with most of
the region, many campsites are situated on stream terraces, but there are also some in the uplands.
Two-hundred-nineteen sites are classified as lithic scatters, and generally these are located in the
uplands and along stream cutbanks where gravels outcrop. They also exhibit evidence of being
used for the past 11,000 years. Twenty-four lithic procurement sites have been recorded in the
county, as has a single sandstone burned rock midden. Three prehistoric human burials have been
documented. Historic sites consist of local family cemeteries, with just a few burials in each,
house sites and farmsteads from as early as the 1850s, and trash scatters (Atlas 2016).

what bands or tribes were within the modern political boundaries of McMullen County before

Archaeologists have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites, including large
open campsites that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces with numerous
campfires, where a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered
animal remains are found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or on higher
terrain where more ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can expect
stone chipping stations, or prehistoric quarries.
Nevertheless, the lack of previously documented sites is thought to be a direct reflection of the
lack of cultural resource surveys near the PA that would have located sites, rather than the
probable non-existence of sites. In fact, the Project Area lies to the west of a large archaeological
survey conducted in anticipation of the construction of the Choke Canyon Reservoir (e.g., Hall
et al. 1981).
During that survey conducted in the 1980s, 116 prehistoric archaeological sites located in both
Live Oak and McMullen counties were documented, ranging in age from 350 years ago to 11,000
years ago. Through all the periods of Choke Canyon's history, humans subsisted by hunting and
gathering natural food resources available in the area. In addition, archaeologists from the Center
for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio conducted archaeological
investigations at eight historic sites at Choke Canyon Reservoir. A number of different types of
structures were investigated, the purpose being to extract as much information as possible about
architecture, lifestyles, and settlement patterns during the last half of the 19th century within the
reservoir area. Artifacts recovered helped recreate the life of the people, demonstrating how they
met the challenges of living in a frontier area, and how life changed after the Civil War and the
coming of law and order, railroads, and modern communications (Fox and Ward 1986).
Archaeological Sites and Surveys
As shown in Figure 3, the Locke Lateral will impact portions of archaeological sites 41MC405407, 41MC794, and 41MC795 (described below). Otherwise, the Texas Atlas shows that multiple
archaeological surveys had been conducted within one mile of the proposed Locke Lateral, and
ten other archaeological sites had been documented.
Old Maps, Aerial Photographs, Historic Research
A standard source of review is the extensive collection of online maps and aerial photographs
available at the Perry Castañeda Library at the University of Texas at Austin Perry Castañeda
Library. This source would normally prove invaluable for researching the possibility of, and
potential for, historic sites and structures to exist within one mile of a project area. In this case,
the Locke Lateral appears to be in a rural area of McMullen County that either warranted little
attention, or the area was void of historic structures. The earliest maps found were a 1925 U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers map of the Tilden area, which shows no structures either within or
adjacent to the proposed Locke Lateral (Perry Castañeda Library 2016).
12

Nevertheless, the lack of comprehensive historic map and aerial information, coupled with the
paucity of cultural resources surveys within the area is possibly, and perhaps probably, why no
information is available regarding the presence of historic structures, ranching or industrial
activities, or persons of historic significance to the immediate area.
Technically, any structures old than 45 years are now considered of interest by the Texas
Historical Commission, and this should be considered when the pipeline right-of-way is
excavated. Historic sites recorded in McMullen County consist of local family cemeteries with
just a few burials in each, house sites and farmsteads from as early as the 1850s, and trash
scatters.

Soils
A review of county soils maps and publications online indicated that there are six different soil
types that will be encountered along the Locke Lateral right-of-way (Table 1; Figure 7). The six
soil types indicate that they are of varying depths, with different sedimentation, deposition, and
erosional rates (Web Soil Survey 2016). However, potential terrace deposits in close proximity
to Far Live Oak Creek and two first order tributaries of Live Oak Creek offer the highest potential
for buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist. In this case, the pipeline extends across
prime areas that prehistoric inhabitants may have occupied.
In reality, without an on-the-ground physical examination and shovel testing program, the true
existence of deeply buried and intact archaeological deposits that can be potentially significant
to our understandings of Texas prehistory can only be modeled and surmised. As such, Tierras
Antiguas recommended a full pedestrian survey along the proposed right-of-way.

Field Survey Goals, Methodology, and Levels of Efforts
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing if appropriate. The topics
addressed were site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical
framework is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems
for the South Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic survey
methodology;

14

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Two archaeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian survey along the pipeline, meandering back
and forth across the 60-foot width of the right-of-way. Surface visibility ranged from 70 to 100
percent. Particular attention was provided to the crossings of first and second order tributaries of
drainages. All cutbanks, and rodent and mammal backdirt piles along the right-of-way were
thoroughly examined.
In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both
prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via
sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic
artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as significant to the interpretation
of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics.
These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal
Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic
occurrences adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in this
report of investigations.
Two shovel tests were dug in the previously mapped location of archaeological site 41MC407.
They were dug in 20-centimeter (cm) levels, and all sediments were screened through 1/4-inch
wire mesh. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered from shovel tests were
not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 20 cm of the backfilled shovel test. The
results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, and are available upon
request from TAAI in Martindale, Texas.
The shovel tests were documented were mapped using a GPS. Field notes were made about the
site in general, and the portion of the site that was to be impacted by construction of the Locke
Lateral was photographed. In addition, the surfaces within the right-of-way though sites
41MC405, 41MC406, 41MC794, and 41MC795 were thoroughly examined. Finally, digital
photographs representing the surveyed right-of-way in general were taken as well, and a photo
log was maintained.

Results of the Investigations

During the survey it became readily apparent that approximately 90 percent of the project’s
surface area was either mechanically disturbed by ranching activities such as bulldozing, brush
clearing, cultivation, and burning. In addition, much of the Locke Lateral right-of-way paralleled

15

a previously buried pipeline, and previously installed utility poles. However, the surface visibility
was excellent, allowing for the discovery of any artifacts along the right-of-way.
No evidence of cultural materials was observed along any portion of the right-of-way.
Nevertheless, the archaeological sites as mapped by various surveys that will be impacted by
construction of the Locke Lateral are described below.

41MC405
Background and Site Setting
This prehistoric lithic scatter of an unknown age was first documented by Espey, Huston &
Associates archaeologists while surveying a utility right-of-way for the Karnes Electric Co-op in
2000. As shown in Figure 8, the site centroid as mapped in 2000 indicates that it is located on
the west edge of a first order tributary of Live Oak Creek. The soils are mapped as Montell clay
(MtB) within the Locke Lateral right-of-way, and the site’s elevation slopes toward the northeast
from 341-340 feet above mean sea level. In 2000, archaeologists observed a sparse scatter of
chipped stone flakes and cobbles on the surface. Shovel testing revealed no subsurface cultural
material. They opined that the site was disturbed, surficial in nature, roughly 35 percent intact,
possessed limited research potential, and not eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).

Figure 8. Location of 41MC405.

16

Current Investigations
Two TAAI archaeologists conducted a pedestrian survey of the portion of the Locke Lateral that
was to impact 41MC405 as mapped in 2000, with particular attention being provided to both sides
of the intermittent tributary. Although surface visibility averaged greater than 70 percent, no
evidence of cultural material was observed on the surface within the Locke Lateral right-of-way.
Following the pedestrian survey, they excavated two shovel tests on opposite banks of the
tributary (see Figure 8). No artifacts were found in either of the two shovel tests, and turbated and
mottled soils were present to 60 centimeters below the surface.
Site Summary, Conclusions and Recommendation
The portion of 41MC405 that will be impacted by construction of the Locke Lateral was
previously examined in 2000, and archaeologists assessed the site as surficial in nature and
heavily disturbed. Following our 2016 surface examination and shovel testing in the Locke
Lateral right-of-way, TAAI archaeologists discovered no evidence of cultural material. In sum,
it is the opinion of TAAI that construction of the Locke Lateral through this portion of 41MC405
will not impact significant cultural resources, and that construction should be allowed to proceed
as planned, with no further archaeological investigations. However, TAAI recommends that if
previously undiscovered cultural resource deposits are encountered during development, TAAI
or any other professional archaeological consultant be contacted to evaluate those finds.

41MC406
Background and Site Setting
This site was defined as prehistoric lithic scatter and procurement site of an unknown age. As with
41MC405, it was first documented by Espey, Huston & Associates archaeologists while surveying
a utility right-of-way for the Karnes Electric Co-op in 2000. As shown in Figure 9, the site as
mapped in 2000 indicates that it covers roughly 475 meters from east to west, and roughly 100
meters from north to south. The soils are mapped as Montell clay (MtB) within the Locke Lateral
right-of-way, and the site’s elevation slopes toward the northeast from 365-340 feet above mean
sea level. In 2000, archaeologists observed a sparse scatter of chipped stone flakes, cores, and
crude bifaces on the surface. Shovel testing revealed no subsurface cultural material. They opined
that the site was disturbed, strictly surficial, roughly 40 percent intact, possessed limited research
potential, and not eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Current Investigations
Two TAAI archaeologists conducted a pedestrian survey of the portion of the Locke Lateral that
was to impact 41MC406 as mapped in 2000. Surface visibility averaged greater than 70 percent.
The only evidence of cultural material observed on the surface were widely dispersed chipped
stone cortical flakes. Otherwise, machine crushed cobbles were prevalent across the area.

Figure 9. 41MC406 site map.
Site Summary, Conclusions and Recommendation
The portion of 41MC406 that will be impacted by construction of the Locke Lateral was
previously examined in 2000, and archaeologists assessed the site as surficial in nature and
heavily disturbed. Following our 2016 surface examination of the Locke Lateral right-of-way,
TAAI archaeologists discovered an ephemeral surface scatter of primary and secondary flakes.
In sum, it is the opinion of TAAI that construction of the Locke Lateral through this portion of
41MC406 will not impact significant cultural resources, and that construction should be allowed
to proceed as planned, with no further archaeological investigations. However, TAAI
recommends that if previously undiscovered cultural resource deposits are encountered during
development, TAAI or any other professional archaeological consultant be contacted to evaluate
those finds.

41MC407
Background and Site Setting
This site is a third along the periphery of the Locke Lateral that was documented in 2000 by
Espey, Huston & Associates archaeologists while surveying a utility right-of-way for the Karnes
Electric Co-op. At that time they classified it as a lithic procurement site with scattered pieces of
chipped stone flakes within a dense outcrop of chert cobbles. No diagnostics were observed, so
the period or periods of occupation of this site is unknown.
In 2000, archaeologists estimated that the surface artifacts extended roughly 150 meters from east
to west and 40 meters from north to south, but the only map available shows only the site’s
centroid (Figure 10). The soils are mapped as Montell clay (MtB) and Monwebb clay (MwA)
within the Locke Lateral right-of-way, and the site’s elevation slopes toward the northeast from
360-350 feet above mean sea level. In 2000, archaeologists observed a sparse but extensive
surface scatter of chipped stone flakes and tested cobbles. Shovel testing revealed no subsurface
cultural material. Their evaluation of the site was that it was disturbed, strictly surficial, roughly
18

45 percent intact, possessed limited research potential, and not eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

Figure 10. 41MC407 site map.
Current Investigations
On June 7, 2016, two TAAI archaeologists conducted a pedestrian survey of the portion of the
Locke Lateral right-of-way that was to impact 41MC407 as the area was described by
archaeologists in 2000. Surface visibility averaged between 30 and 90 percent in June 2016.
Notably, the western edge of the site exhibited significant erosion (Figure 11), while examinations
of cutbanks within the proposed Locke Lateral right-of-way revealed no evidence of cultural
material. Terrace remnants that could contain buried and intact cultural materials were tested by
the excavation of three shovel tests (see Figures 10 and 12). However, no evidence of cultural
materials were observed in any of the three tests excavated to 80 centimeters below the surface.

41MC795
Background and Site Setting
This is a second prehistoric lithic scatter adjacent to the Locke Lateral that was documented in
March 2014 by TerraExplorations archaeologists during a survey of the Nustar Choke Canyon
Loop project. Based upon a widely dispersed surface scatter of chipped stone, they estimated the
site as measuring roughly 585 meters (nw-se) x 70 meters (e-w), but surmised that the scatter
likely extended both to the east and west beyond their survey corridor (Figure 15). Widely
dispersed surface artifacts observed in 2014 included 116 flakes, 14 cores, 2 scrapers, 1 preform,
2 unifacial tools, 1 bifacial tool that they surmised could be a Hell Gap knife, and 1 lanceolate
biface. These two latter tools suggest a possible Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic occupation.
The soils are mapped as Maverick clay (McC), Whitsett-Picosa complex (WPD), and Montell
clay (MtB) within the Locke Lateral right-of-way, and the site’s elevation slopes toward the
southeast from 360-320 feet above mean sea level. Although 25 shovel tests were excavated in
2014, subsurface cultural material was found shallowly buried in only two of the 25. Their
evaluation of the site in 2014 argued that it was heavily disturbed, generally surficial only,

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations

A full pedestrian field survey was conducted by two archaeologists on June 7, 2016, and five
shovel tests were excavated in locales where there was a potential for buried and in situ cultural
deposits to be extant. No cultural materials were observed in any of the five shovel tests. Surface
visibility along the proposed right-of-way varied from 70 to 100-percent. The only evidence of
cultural material observed on the surface were widely dispersed chipped stone cortical flakes on
previously recorded site 41MC406. Otherwise, machine crushed cobbles were prevalent across
the area.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Locke Lateral be allowed to
proceed as it is currently planned, with no further archaeological investigations. However, Tierras
Antiguas further recommends that if any undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during
development along the Locke Lateral, such finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras
Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.
