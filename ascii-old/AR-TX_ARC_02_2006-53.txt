ABSTRACT
On November 17 and 21, 2006, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of a 50 acre tract which the
North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) intends to use for a
disposal site for sediment from the dredging of an existing channel
through which water from Lake Chapman is transported to their pump
station. The survey area is located east of the community of Peerless north
of FM 71. Hopkins County Road 4810 is west of and adjacent to the study
area. The archaeological survey was conducted for Freese and Nichols,
Inc. which is doing the environmental permitting for the water district.
Since the NTMWD is a political entity of the State of Texas, an antiquities
permit was required and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission issued Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4306 for the survey.
It was anticipated that a quarry site might be encountered due to the
presence of Uvalde/upland gravels further north of the area. However, no
archaeological sites were seen on the ground surface during the intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey and no cultural materials were found in
ten shovel tests. The absence of gravels in the subsurface is probably a
result of the material deflating onto the surface from erosion through
natural as well as farming activities. At least seventy-five percent of the
area had been farmed and twenty-five percent was eroded and incised.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted.
Although unlikely, if buried sites are discovered during construction, work
should immediately cease in that area, and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission should be notified. Work should not
continue until the proper investigations have been carried out after
consultation with the Archeology Division.

INTRODUCTION

On November 17 and 21, 2006, AR Consultants Inc., (ARC) conducted an intensive
pedestrian survey of approximately 50 acres for a proposed sediment disposal site located
east of Peerless in Hopkins County, Texas. The sediment disposal site was investigated
because the North Texas Municipal Water District intends to dredge silt from an existing
channel in Chapman Lake (formerly Cooper Lake) and needs a site to dispose the
sediment from the dredging operation. The proposed sediment disposal site is located
approximately 3,484 feet east of the community of Peerless and about 1,877 feet north of
FM 71. Hopkins County Road 4810 is west of and adjacent to the study area. The study
area is located on a divide and in an upland setting. The scope of the project included a
records review, a pedestrian survey and shovel testing areas considered to have potential
for containing buried archaeological site deposits, and a final report.
The intensive pedestrian archaeological survey was done for Freese and Nichols, Inc.
which is conducting the environmental permitting for the North Texas Municipal Water
District (NTMWD). Since the NTMWD is a political entity of the State of Texas, a Texas
antiquities permit was required and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission issued Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4306 for the archaeological survey.
An outfall structure may be placed in the intermittent first order drainage present in the
northern portion of the study area; therefore, relevant federal legislation includes the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291).
This report was written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (N.D.). The following report presents a brief description of the natural
setting of the project area. This is followed by a short discussion about cultural history of
Hopkins County, Texas. The research design and methodology follow. The results of the
field survey are presented in the major section of the report. Recommendations conclude
the text. A list of references cited is at the end of the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Hopkins County is located in Northeast Texas and is bordered on the north by the South
Sulphur River. The northern half, in which the study area is located, and the southwestern
quarter are mapped as Blackland Prairie while the southeastern quarter is in the post oak
belt. Of the little timber present in the county, hardwoods are found along drainages. The
terrain ranges from level to rolling. Streams drain into the South Sulphur River north of
the divide (Gilbert and Gilbert 2006:1).
The underlying bedrock consists of the Tertiary-aged undifferentiated Midway Group
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1966). The Midway Group consists of the Wills Point and
Kincaid Formations. The formations consist mainly of clay but contain siltstone
concretions, thin beds of limestone with some sandstone.
The soil association for the study area is the Wilson-Bazette which consists of nearly
level to strongly sloping upland loams (Lane 1977:General Soil Map). A variety of soils
are present in the 50 acre tract and consist of Wilson clay loam with 1 to 2 percent slopes,
eroded Ferris clay with 5 to 12 percent slopes, Bazette clay loam with 3 to 5 and 5 to 12
percent slopes and Crockett loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes (Lane 1977:Sheet 12).
The Blackland Prairie upland (Kuchler 1969:Region No. 68) is classified as being
dominated by Andropogon-Sipa grasses, and Gould (1975) notes that little bluestem is
the climax dominant. Various other grasses are present. Mesquite is also present today
but this is due to recent invasion of this species into the Blackland. According to various
authors, including Lynott (1979), the prairie once supported a cover of tall grasses and
was inhabited by now absent herbivores including bison and antelope. Certainly, deer still
inhabit the floodplain forests.
The study area lies within the Texan Biotic Province (Blair 1950:101-102). Forty-nine
species of mammals occur within the province including deer, raccoon, rabbits and
opossum. Both species of terrapene (Terrapene ornate and Terrapene carolina) occur, as
well as nine species of lizards. In addition, thirty-nine types of snakes can be found, along
with thirteen species of anuran fauna.

CULTURE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The earliest occupation in Hopkins County was during the Paleo-Indian period (11,000 to
8,000 B.C.) and is expected to have been by ancient Native Americans who made very
distinctive Clovis points. No Clovis points are reported to have come from the county
(Meltzer and Bever 1995:49). These point styles and other early styles are probably
present in artifact collections from sites in the county, but they have not been recorded at
TARL and are not discussed in the literature. Even with insufficient data on Paleo-Indian
occupation, there is little question that the region was occupied during that time period.
Subsequent occupation during the Archaic period (8,000 B.C. to A.D. 500) is recognized
as having two temporal divisions, an Early Archaic period and a Late Archaic period.
Both are characterized as a hunting and gathering way of life practiced by mobile bands
who occupied recognized group territories. Dart points, grinding stones, and specific
point types characterize these periods. Early Archaic point types include; Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Edgewood, Meserve, Dalton, San Patrice, Kirk, Palmer, and Wells. While
Late Archaic point types are Gary, and Ellis to name a few. The fauna hunted and
gathered by these early people was a truly modern animal population. Habitation sites
have not been reported in the county.
After the Archaic period, pottery and arrow points were added to the Indians' set of tools.
These technological changes coincided with a gradual increase in population size. The
prehistoric Caddoan peoples are first recognized about A.D. 500 to 600. These early
Caddoans occupied large villages which were located along the major drainages. The
villages occasionally contained low earthen mounds, and usually consisted of several
individual houses. Cemeteries are frequently associated with, but separate from, the
villages. The economy was based on foods secured by hunting and gathering, although
farming was probably practiced by A.D. 1000.
About A.D. 1300, a shift in site location away from the major drainages, and into the
headwaters of smaller tributaries resulted in the rearrangement of people into small, but
numerous, hamlets scattered throughout the region of northeast Texas. Major sites seem
to have continued being located on the banks of the Red River in Texas and Louisiana
during this period. Farming was certainly important during this period, and these people
are recognized in the historic period as the Hasinai Confederacy of the Caddo.
Anglo-American interest in Hopkins County began with land speculation before and
during the time period of the Republic of Texas. Lovick Dikes was issued a land title by
the Mexican government before November 13, 1835, and Thomas J. Rusk, Colonel James
Reilly, and Edward P. Gains patented land in the area. The first permanent settlement was
made in December of 1842 a few miles northeast of Sulphur Bluff by William and
Harvey Hargrave (St. Clair 1965:12).

Hopkins County was created out of Lamar and Nacogdoches counties and was named for
the pioneering Hopkins family or for Eldridge Hopkins, the owner of the land donated for
the county seat of Tarrant County (St. Clair 1965:16). The original size of the county was
reduced in 1870 and 1871 by the creation of Rains, Delta, and Lamar counties. The
county seat was moved to Sulphur Springs in 1871.
The evolution of wagon roads from trails and the coming of the railroad fueled the
economic development of the county by promoting immigration. The first settlers had
come by way of Jonesborough and points northeast, and in spite of the fact that the main
road from the Red River to Central Texas missed Hopkins County, there had been an
important trail entering from the northeast and exiting at the southwest corner (St. Clair
1965:11 ). As attention was focused on the central part of the county, roads radiated to all
sections.
In 1876 the first railroad line, the East Line and Red River, designed to connect Jefferson,
Sulphur Springs, and Greenville, was begun. The second railroad was the St. Louis
Southwestern to Texas Railroad which passed through Sulphur Springs west to Fort
Worth,.
Previous Archaeological Investigations
The majority of work that has been carried out in Hopkins County centers around
Chapman (formerly Cooper) Lake (Hyatt et al 1974; Doehner and Larson 1978; Doehner,
Peter, and Skinner 1978; Jurney and Bohlin 1993; Fields et al 1997). Of those reports,
Fields and others found that most of the sites were located on slight elevations within the
floodplain or along interfluves. Outside of the Chapman Lake area, very little
archaeological work has been published about Hopkins County. However, three sites
containing lithic debris, Gary points and fire-cracked rock have been located along Bear
Creek (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2006). A survey for the Soil Conservation
Service (Hyatt 1974) found nine sites along intermittent drainages. All of the sites were
classified as small temporary camps and consisted of surface lithic scatters.
Two analogous sites (41HP192) and the Finley Quarry site (41HP174) were recorded
during the archaeological survey of Chapman Lake (Jurney and Bohlin 1993). Site
41HP192 is in an upland setting and consist of a thin veneer of Uvalde/upland gravels
above 500 above feet msl as is the study area. Site 41HP174, also located in the uplands,
has Uvalde/upland gravels which are almost continuous over the site area. Interestingly,
the site is located approximately 450 feet above msl, but the slopes continue upward to
above 500 feet msl. These sites will be discussed later.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
The purpose of the research design outlined below was to insure that fieldwork makes a
contribution to a better understanding of the prehistoric and historic settlement of
Hopkins County, Texas. As a result, we proposed the research problems below.
One demographic research problem guided the field survey. It focused on the prehistoric
utilization of the various parts of the upland and intermittent tributaries that are crossed
by the pipeline routes. Survey for Chapman Lake has shown that prehistoric sites appear
to be concentrated in the bottomland settings in the floodplains of major drainages
(Doehner, Peter, and Skinner 1978:213-219). There is no major consensus about the
function of the various sites, therefore the following was proposed as the first research
problem:
Prehistoric sites which may represent temporary hunting, gathering camps or
quarry sites [lithic procurement sites], if near lag gravel deposits.
We anticipated that these site type locations would be mutually exclusive and that
recording the number and types of tools and flakes/chips, and other artifacts would allow
for the recognition of different tool kits and time of occupation.
Secondly, since the study area is adjacent to a county road, it was felt that historical
residences might be encountered.
The third, and even more basic, research problem guided the survey; simply stated the
question asked “How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they
leave behind?” Most frequently, small-scale surveys of this type gather information in
response to this more open-minded research question, which guides almost all
archaeological surveys.
As previously stated, the area of effect is 50 acres. The study area was investigated by the
surveyors walking meandering transects oriented east-west which were spaced 30 meters
apart. Although the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) recommends that a shovel test
be excavated per three acres, this recommendation was not followed. Shovel testing was
done on a judgmental basis due to the upland setting. Shovel tests were excavated in
areas that had from less than 10 to 50 percent ground visibility. Areas with greater than
50 percent ground visibility were not shovel tested. The loamy matrix was screened
through ¼" hardware cloth screens and the clayey matrix was broken by hand and
visually examined as were the pit walls. Shovel tests were dug to at least 30 cm below the
surface or to the subsoil. Since the analogous recorded sites in the area were found on the
surface or in the upper 20 cm, it was felt that artifacts would be present in the upper 20
cm, or plow zone, of the shovel tests. Notes were made on the topography, soil,
vegetation as well as other relevant data and photographs were taken. Based on the
geology and the soils present, no backhoe trenching was needed.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into various parts. The survey area is described and is followed by
a description of the survey. The Uvalde/upland gravel is discussed next. Conclusions
derived from information gathered during the survey ends the chapter. Shovel tests are
discussed generally in the text, but specific information is provided in Table 1. Shovel
test locations can be found on Figure 5.
The Survey Area
The survey area consists of 50 acres in a rectangular shape east of and adjacent to CR
4810. The study area consists of a forested area adjacent to the first order drainage in the
northern part of the study area which makes up about 25 percent of the study area. The
rest is in improved pasture. Trees in the forested area and along fence lines include oak,
hackberry, elm, hickory, eastern red cedar, honey locust, sumac, sweet gum and
mesquite. Understory vegetation includes clover, saw greenbriar, grape vine, berry vines,
rabbit grass, broomweed and native grasses and bushes. The improved pasture consists of
coastal Bermuda grass. The first order drainage has a slope of at least 10 degrees with a
narrow channel. Uvalde/upland gravels (Figures 2 and 3) are present along the edge and
in the channel. Scattered cobbles can be found in the improved pasture. Ground visibility
in the forested area ranged from less than 10 to 50 percent. However, the eroded slopes
allowed for excellent observation due to the 100 percent ground visibility (Figure 4).
Eye-height visibility averaged 40 meters. Ground visibility in the improved pasture was
at least 70 percent. Eye-height visibility was excellent.

The Survey
Survey began in the northwest corner adjacent to CR 4810 and proceeded east. Some
time between 1964 and today, the road east of the study area was fenced off and a CR
4810 was built west of the study area. Shovel test 1 was excavated on top of a knoll
approximately 60 m east of CR 4810 where the Uvalde/upland gravel was present. The
shovel test uncovered 35 cm of culturally sterile clay. Shovel test 2 was placed on a ridge
overlooking the drainage to the west and uncovered 34 cm of culturally sterile clay.
Shovel tests 3 also was placed on ridge overlooking the drainage and uncovered 36 cm
culturally sterile loamy clay.
Shovel test 4 was placed in the vicinity of two wooden sheds that had collapsed and the
shovel test encountered 35 cm of fine sandy clay. No cultural materials older than 50
years were found in the vicinity of the sheds and no house foundation, cultural features,
cistern, well or root/storm cellar were found. Shovel tests 5 and 6 were placed on a bench
overlooking the drainage to the west. Shovel test 5 uncovered 93 cm of sandy clay and
shovel test 6 encountered 30 cm of loamy clay. Both shovel tests were culturally sterile.

Shovel test 7 was placed on a ridge that overlooked the drainage to the northwest and the
shovel test uncovered 30 cm of culturally sterile loamy clay. Shovel tests 8 and 9 were
placed along a slight northeast-southwest trending ridge. Both shovel tests were culturally
sterile. Shovel test 8 uncovered 30 cm of clay overlying clay containing calcium
carbonate nodules to 35+ cm below the ground surface. Shovel test 9 encountered 30 cm
of loamy clay. Shovel test 10 was placed on ridge that overlooks the drainage to the north
and uncovered 35 cm of culturally sterile loamy clay.
No cultural materials were found older than 50 years on the ground surface during the
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey and no cultural materials were found in the
shovel tests.
Uvalde/upland gravel
As previously mentioned, Uvalde/upland gravel is present in the north central part of the
study area. The material consists of quartzite. No chert was present. None of the cobbles
appear to have been tested. Widths range (Figure 6) from 3 to 4 cm to 15 to 18 cm. Most
of the gravels are in the small and large category. Intermediate size cobbles are scarce.
Most of the smaller cobbles have movead downslope due to erosion. Attempts were made
to flake the cobbles, but were unsuccessful.

Figure 6.

Width range of Uvalde/upland gravels from the study area.

The study area was compared to two sites. Site 41HP174 is located approximately 1.3
miles north of the study area and site 41HP192 is located on the Hopkins/Wood County
border south of the study area. The Uvalde/upland gravel cobbles were nearly continuous
of a 400 square meter area on site 41HP174, the Finlay Quarry site, (Jurney and Bohlin
1993:153) which is not the case in our study area. While not as abundant as site

41HP174, lithics and tested cobbles are present at site 41HP192 (Jurney and Bohlin
1993:80) and covered approximately 2,500 square meters. Artifacts were found 20 cm
below the ground surface in shovel tests. No flakes or cobble concentrations were present
in the study area, and, a rough estimate is that probably one knappable cobble was
present per square meter. Also, no artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests.
Interestingly, no chert was present at the two sites which is similar to the study area. Site
41HP192 was on Bazette clay loam and site 41HP174 was on Crockett loam. Both soils
are present in the study area although more study will be needed before a correlation
between soil type and gravel can be made. The author suggests that the quartzite was not
used because of its poor quality and that more suitable quarry sites were closer to the
South Sulphur River north of the study area.
Conclusions
No cultural materials were found during the pedestrian survey or revealed by shovel
testing. No historic structures or signature plants were seen. The prehistoric sites that
have been recorded nearby were probably along areas where water flow was more
permanent north of the study area, and, possibly where chert was present in the
Uvalde/upland gravel outcrops. Historic sites were not found. The European-American
historic inhabitants of the area may have preferred to live closer to roadways and use the
study area for farming or pasture land.

RECOMMENDATIONS

It is AR Consultants’ recommendation that further cultural resource investigations are
unwarranted since no archaeological sites were encountered on the surface during the
intensive pedestrian survey and no cultural materials were found in the shovel tests.
However, if buried cultural resources are encountered during the construction, work
should immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission be advised of the discovery. Work should not continue until the
proper investigations have been carried out after consultation with the Texas Historical
Commission.
