Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

Abstract
The Texas Governor’s Mansion is one of the most important Governor’s Mansions in America.
It was declared a Texas Historical Landmark in 1962, and placed on the National register
of Historic Places in 1974. While undergoing Deferred Maintenance Project renovations in
June 2008, the Texas Governor’s Mansion was set on fire by an arsonist. After the fire, the
project then became one of comprehensive stabilization and restoration. Plans for restoration
that would impact the soils around the mansion called for 1) new utilities, to include a ground
source heat pump geothermal installation with 40 to 50 wells, 2) removal of brick pavers and
a pecan tree at the rear of the Mansion, and 3) a basement addition to the rear of the Mansion.
The State Preservation Board (SPB) is responsible for the preservation and maintenance of
the Mansion, and managed this project for the state. In November 2010, the SPB contracted
with Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm) of Austin to conduct archaeological
monitoring of ground disturbances that were planned during the ongoing restoration program.
A Scope of Work was approved by the Texas Historical Commission, and Antiquities Permit
#5822 was issued for the project. Archaeologists remained on call, and conducted spot
monitoring as requested during the period November 2010 through October 2011.
During the course of trenching investigations at the rear of the Mansion, as well as the
monitoring of multiple trenches and hand-excavated soils removed by construction workers
on all four sides of the Mansion, a total of eight cultural features were documented, and 191
artifacts were collected.
Following analysis, redundant and potentially non-significant artifacts were recommended
to be discarded. Otherwise, those artifacts that were deemed to be potentially significant for
possible future studies will be permanently housed at the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin.

Acknowledgments
It has been our distinct pleasure to work with the Texas State Preservation Board staff. Ms.
Dealey Herndon, Ms. Katie Daly, and Mr. Kevin Koch knew all the answers to our questions,
and coordinated a multitude of schedules to ensure overall success. They are true professionals
dedicated to the historic preservation of not only the Mansion itself, but also the cultural
resources on the grounds.
Other professionals that were extremely helpful, ensured communication concerning ongoing
construction schedules, and were genuinely interested in the history of the grounds are Mr.
Jerry Ott, Construction Project Manager for White Construction Company, and Project
Superintendent for White Construction Company, Daniel Howard.
We would be remiss if we did not mention Mr. Hector Medrano, longtime gardener at
the Mansion, and who because of his knowledge was able to provide us with invaluable
information regarding the extensive soil disturbances that have occurred on the grounds. In
terms of interpreting the integrity of archaeological deposits and features, his information was
extremely helpful.
Assisting in our subsurface investigations at the rear of the Mansion, the backhoe trenching
was skillfully accomplished by Mr. Miguel Castro of BCS Services. Mr. Sonny Horton, owner
of BCS Services coordinated backhoe services for us on short notice. The logistics for the
geothermal well system installation were very efficiently orchestrated by Jason Swann, Marco
Mortero, and Justino Martinez.
David Nickels served as the Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist for the project,
and Emory Worrell conducted the bulk of the monitoring chores. The artifacts were analyzed
by Dave and Emory, and Emory prepared the artifacts, photographs, and supporting documents
for curation.
Our gratitude also goes to those talented people who contributed their expertise in GIS,
photography, and figure presentation. Much of the artifact photography was accomplished by
Dan Rose, and Joel Butler’s professionalism is exhibited in the drafted figures and overlays
presented in the report. Nick Trierweiler was EComm’s Project Manager and reviewed and
edited the draft report. Margo Gregory re-edited and produced the report for publication.
Thanks very much to these most gifted individuals.
Finally, we are indeed grateful to the Texas Historical Commission’s Mr. Jim Bruseth and Mr.
Mark Denton. They were very helpful in freely offering their historic knowledge, expertise,
and advice throughout the project. Mark took the time to visit the site more than once.

Chapter 1

Introduction and Background
1.1

Introduction

This report is organized into four main sections. Section 1 provides a brief background
explaining how this project came about, along with a brief history of the Governor’s Mansion,
focusing on ground disturbing events that have occurred on the Mansion’s grounds through the
years.
Section 2 discusses the goals and methods, including some background on historical artifact
analysis. Section 3 provides the results of the investigations, beginning with discoveries
on the west side of the Mansion, and progressing in a clockwise manner to the north, east,
and south lawns. Section 4
summarizes the results and
provides recommendations for
the curation or non-curation
of artifacts, as well as further
research. Appendix A presents
a description of three whole
bottles found by construction
workers. Finally, a listing of the
artifacts collected during this
project is included at Appendix
B.

1.2	Background
The Texas Governor’s Mansion
(41TV1872) was designed
and built by Abner Cook, a
master builder who constructed
numerous
Greek
Revival
style architectural homes in
Austin. Between 1854 and
1856, he designed and built the
Mansion for Governor Elisha
Marshall Pease. It is within
walking distance of the State
Capitol (Figure 1), and has
been occupied by every Texas

governor since 1856. From both an architectural and a historic perspective, the Texas Governor’s
Mansion is one of the most important Governor’s Mansions in America (Alexander 1985). It
was declared a Texas Historical Landmark in 1962, and placed on the National register of
Historic Places in 1974 (Smryl 2011).
While undergoing Deferred Maintenance Project renovations in June 2008, the Texas Governor’s
Mansion was set on fire by an arsonist. At the time of the fire, the Mansion was several months
into a comprehensive deferred maintenance project to upgrade the mechanical, electrical, and
plumbing systems, as well as make other improvements related to the operations of the home.
After the fire, the funds set aside for the Deferred Maintenance Project were re-allocated to
the Stabilization Project, and the project then became one of comprehensive stabilization and
restoration. Plans for restoration that would impact the soils around the Mansion called for 1)
new utilities, to include a ground source heat pump geothermal installation with 40 to 50 wells,
2) removal of plywood and brick pavers at the rear of the Mansion, 3) removal of a pecan tree
at the rear of the Mansion, and 4) a basement addition to the rear of the Mansion.
The State Preservation Board (SPB) is responsible for the preservation and maintenance
of the Mansion, and managed this project for the state. Although neither the SPB nor the
Texas Historical commission (THC) anticipated that the restoration project would encounter
unidentified areas of archaeological significance that possibility could not be ruled out. For
that reason, the SPB elected to engage a qualified archaeological firm to be a part of the project
team throughout the construction phase.
In November 2010, the SPB contracted with Ecological Communications Corporation
(EComm) of Austin to conduct archaeological monitoring of ground disturbances that were
planned during the ongoing restoration program. A Scope of Work was approved by the Texas
Historical Commission, and Antiquities Permit #5822 was issued for the project. Archaeologists
remained on call, and conducted spot monitoring as requested during the period November
2010 through October 2011.
Specific archaeological tasks identified before construction began included:
1) Monitor the removal of a pecan tree stump and root ball located in the rear of
the Mansion.
2) Conduct backhoe investigations in the rear of the Mansion following brick
pavement removal of an area approximately 70 feet (ft) x 70 ft. This encompassed
an approximate 30-ft x 30-ft basement addition as well as an approximate 20-ft
layback buffer area along three sides.
3) Monitor the excavation of trenches for the installation of geothermal lines
throughout much of the grounds surrounding the Mansion.

1.3	Project Setting
The Governor’s Mansion is located on an entire city block in downtown Austin, Texas (Figure
2). A thin layer of natural dark loam (10YR 3/2) topsoil is consistent across the Mansion’s
2

grounds where it has not been otherwise
disturbed. Geologically, it sets on
a high, Pleistocene Capitol Terrace
(Rodda 1970:7) consisting of highly
rubified very gravelly sandy clay that
grades with depth from reddish brown
(2.5YR 4/4) to light olive brown (2.5Y
5/3). The gravels are comprised of
cherts and quartzites. These alluvium
deposits are approximately 9–10
meters thick, and lie uncomformably
on Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk
(Figure 3). Given the thin layer of
Holocene topsoil overlying very ancient
alluvium on the Mansion grounds, the
probability of discovering stratified
and intact prehistoric archaeological
deposits is minimal. However, as will
be discussed, there are historic features
that have been excavated into these
soils as early as the 1850s.

1.4	Brief History of the
Governor’s Mansion

Figure 2. City map showing the location of the
Texas Governor’s Mansion in downtown Austin.

We present here a brief history of the
renovations that have occurred to the Mansion since construction began in 1854. More relative
to the current project, however, are the improvements that have been made to the grounds
surrounding the Mansion. The most comprehensive chronology of modifications and changes
to the Governor’s Mansion has been compiled by Prewitt and Associates following their 2008
investigations. This list by Doug Boyd and Jennifer McWilliams is presented in their 2009
publication as Table 1.2 on pages 8–14 (Boyd and McWilliams 2009), and compiled primarily
from Daniel et al. (1984) and Gammel (1898). It is from these sources that we synthesize the
construction that has occurred on the grounds through the years since the Mansion was first
constructed, and by implication their impact on buried features.
Texas joined the Union in 1845, with Austin remaining the capital of the once former Republic
of Texas. The burgeoning state was in need of a new governor’s residence and in 1848, Congress
passed a joint resolution authorizing the construction of a residence for the Governor (Gammel
1898, Vol. 3:29). After careful consideration a lot was chosen which is surrounded by Lavaca,
Guadalupe, Tenth, and Eleventh streets (see Figure 1). Master builder Abner Hugh Cook was
contracted to design, procure materials for, and construct what would be the home of every
Texas governor since 1856 (Alexander 1985).

Abner Cook’s previous building
experiences can be found in the southern
states of Georgia and Tennessee, where
he undoubtedly was influenced by
the Greek Revival style architecture
common to such prominent residences
of the area. Andrew Jackson’s country
place, the Hermitage, was said to be
a significant influence. After moving
to Austin in 1839, Mr. Cook began
designing and building residences
first in the Federal-style, then in the
Ionic Greek style which was to be the
style of the new Governor’s Mansion
(Hafertepe 2011).
Construction of the Mansion began
in 1854 with Abner supplying the
materials from his interests in a lumber
mill in Bastrop and a brick kiln that
he built on Shoal Creek in Austin. The
basic plan of the house consisted of a
square, two-story building with a grand
Figure 3. Geological map of the area
Greek Ionic portico on the front, eastsurrounding the Governor’s Mansion.
facing side of the house. Not much is
known about the workers involved in
the construction, but it was common
during this time period for slave labor to have been used, if not directly in the building of
them—at least in the production of construction materials such as bricks and lumber. Handmade Austin common bricks (with a “frog” on one side) and wood from Bastrop were the chief
building materials for the Mansion.
Many structures in Austin were built with Austin common bricks in the mid to late 19th century.
The Loblolly pine harvested from Bastrop for construction was apparently not kiln-dried, as a
fractured piece of wood from the Mansion still emanates a strong sap smell (D. Emory Worrell,
personal observation). Machine-cut nails were predominantly used as the fastening hardware
in the carpentry work. A two-story ell was built at the rear (west side) of the house and used as
a kitchen and servants’ quarters. This semi-detached structure was the only means of entrance
for servants, via a covered porch (Hafertepe 2011).
Outbuildings were common for houses of this period and the Governor’s Mansion was no
exception. Generally located at the back of the house in the northwestern quadrant, original
outbuildings included the stables/carriage house, barn, chicken house, and tool shed (Blake
and Kibler 1999).

By 1856, the Mansion was first occupied by Governor Ilisha Pease, and a cistern and privy had
been dug. However, the privy was located in the north-central area of the west lawn, and was
apparently offensive to prominent Austin citizen Joseph Harrell who lived nearby. It was then
moved to the central area of the south lawn, and the structure can be seen in photographs from
the 1890s.
In addition to the installation of a modern toilet inside the Mansion, a garden house and gazebo
were constructed, and numerous trees, shrubs, flowers, and vegetables were planted in 1870
(Gammel 1898, Vol. 4:314; Daniel et al. 1984:90–92). In 1871, the gardener ordered 341 loads
of dirt and 166 loads of manure brought in. By 1874, horse stables had been constructed on
the grounds. In 1877, water hydrants and fountains were installed on the grounds. In 1883, a
new stable was built on the southwest corner of the Mansion. By 1898, the old fence around
the entire grounds had been replaced with a new one, the old sidewalks on the grounds were
terraced, and new steps had been built.
By 1900, cement sidewalks and cement block curbings, and Bermuda grass terraces were
installed. In 1901, legislative appropriations were made for the construction of a new stable
(the current Carriage House) northwest of the Mansion. By 1902, all of the walks had been
graveled, and more trees, flowers, and grass had been planted. In 1914, a family dining room
was constructed over the original cistern and porch area; most outbuildings were torn down
(including the old cistern house and summer house); and picket fences across the front and
sides of the grounds were removed—while fences enclosing the horse lot in the southwest
corner and the Carriage House still remained in place.
A new greenhouse was constructed in the southwest corner of the grounds around 1915, and
included a boiler and hot water system. In 1927, the flower garden was converted to a vegetable
garden. Around 1933, new trees were planted, and a new retaining wall was constructed on
the north side of the Mansion where low spots were filled in. An unknown number of cooking
pits were dug on the grounds in 1941 for an inauguration party. By 1959, an underground
sprinkler system had been installed, walkways were again repaired, and a retaining wall along
the south edge of the grounds had been built. By 1969, the grounds had undergone significant
landscaping, and a brick and iron fence had been built around the grounds; it was at this time
that the “Buckeye Fence” was installed on the brick walls.
In 1969, front gates were installed. By 1982, new construction on the grounds included a
gazebo on the south lawn, a wood front porch to replace a brick porch, a widened driveway to
the Carriage house, new sections of a brick wall by the gate on the north side of the Carriage
House, and widening of the front entrance brick walkway. In addition, the sprinkler system
was upgraded, fence brick walls were replaced with wrought-iron fencing, and additional
landscaping had taken place.

1.5	Previous Archaeological Investigations
The first archaeological investigations project on the grounds of the Mansion was undertaken
by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. in 1998 and 1999. Monitoring of trenching operations on the

north lawn of the Mansion resulted in the discovery, and subsequent excavation of the original,
1850s privy (Blake and Kibler 1999).
More extensive archaeological monitoring and excavations were conducted by Prewitt and
Associates in 2008, during a construction project to replace buried sewer and water lines, and
to expand the basement. A total of 15 features were discovered, including a brick wall for the
1856 basement stairway, a brick wall foundation for the 1856 porch, a later brick-walled grease
trap, and two brick-lined cisterns dating to 1856 and 1914. In addition, ground penetrating
radar employed on the south lawn most likely located in the privy pit that was dug in 1856
(Boyd and McWilliams 2009).

Project Goals and Methods
2.1	Goals
The goals of this project were to:
1) identify all cultural materials observed during soil removal, and if possible to
place the artifacts within a temporal framework;
2) identify all subsurface cultural features, and place them within a temporal
framework based upon their design and architecture, as well as archival research;
3) advise the SPB as to the potential significance of these discoveries in an
expedient manner so that they could either be avoided during construction, or
mitigated in a timely manner; and
4) prepare a professional written report of these investigations as required by
contractual agreement with the SPB, as well as satisfying the requirements of
Antiquities Permit #5822.

2.2	Methods
Although
construction
work
schedules
were
effectively
communicated
throughout the duration of
the project, two EComm
staff archaeologists remained
on call in order to respond
to unsuspected discoveries
of cultural materials and
features.
Construction
workers used both a backhoe
and trackhoe for trenching, as
well as shovels in some areas
for soil removal (Figures
Figure 4. Backhoe operations under the patico in the
4 and 5), as trenching and
immediate rear of the Governor’s Mansion (facing south).
other soil removal operations
were carefully monitored by
archaeologists (Figure 6).
During backhoe investigations on the west side of the Mansion, sediments and soils below
the brick paving were to be carefully removed in shallow scrapes (2–3 inches [in]) using a
smooth-bladed bucket. The number of backhoe trenches necessary to evaluate the extent of

any cultural deposits or
features uncovered was to be
determined by the Principal
Investigator.

Figure 5. Trackhoe operating on the south
lawn of the Mansion (facing northeast).

Construction was halted
when cultural features were
unearthed. They were fully
documented either with
sketch maps or photographs,
or both. They were then
shot in with a sub-meter
accuracy Global Positioning
System (GPS). Features of
potential significance were
immediately brought to
the attention of a member
of the SPB. Artifacts were
collected and bagged for
further
analysis.
Each
bag was labeled with an
approximate horizontal and
vertical provenience along
the trenchlines.

All artifacts collected were
accounted for daily while in
the field, and inventoried at
the EComm laboratory. All
artifacts were then identified
and analyzed. Artifacts and
samples were separated by
artifact type and recovery
context to facilitate analysis.
Processing of recovered

and sorting into appropriate
categories. These data were
then entered into an Excel
spreadsheet. Artifacts later determined to be redundant, from heavily disturbed contexts and
non-significant (e.g., vitrified sewer pipe pieces, unidentifiable brick fragments) were discarded
with the permission of the THC.
Otherwise all cultural material to be permanently curated was prepared for storage in accordance
with federal regulation 36 CFR part 79, and in accordance with current guidelines of the Texas
8

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

Archaeological Research Laboratory. Lithic, metal, and ceramic artifacts were washed, airdried, and stored in archival-quality bags. Acid-free labels were placed in all artifact bags.
Each bag was labeled with a provenience or corresponding Lot number. Artifacts larger than
a dime were labeled with permanent ink and covered by a clear coat of acrylic. Other artifacts
were separated by class and stored in acid-free boxes with standard labels.
Finally, all cultural material, field notes, photographs, and drawings, along with a copy of the
final report on acid-free paper, and computer disks pertaining to this project are stored in acidfree boxes at TARL.

2.3	Historic Artifact Analysis
2.3.1 Bottle and Dinnerware Glass
Finding a piece of bottle or jar glass, or dinnerware glass with a maker’s mark on it is always
helpful in determining its approximate date and place of manufacture, as well as its likely
contents. However, there are many other characteristics that can provide clues as to the
probable age and contents of bottles, such as mold seams and scars from the manufacturing
process, labeling, closure types, and glass color. As technology and customer desires changed
through the years, so too did the manufacturing of bottles. It is these discriminators that allow
archaeologists to approximate their age. Primary reference sources used for the bottle glass
analysis were Munsey (1970) and Toulouse (1971). Other specific references are cited within
the following text.
Selected pieces with possibly diagnostic characteristics such as seams, decorations, and makers’
marks were pulled from the collection for further examination. The individual characteristics
of glass often overlap through time.
In the 1700s, bottles were generally hand blown (thus no mold seams). The lip was then crudely
applied in a separate action. Although a lipping tool was used in the production of this piece,
it is considered to be an applied finish and not a “true” tooled finish. A tooled finish employed
the use of a mold, which incorporated the forming, or at least the pre-forming, of the finish
within the mold. After removal from the mold, the bottle was then “tooled” of its remaining
imperfections. This applied and crudely tooled finish, typically just called an ‘applied’ finish,
was placed and shaped on the neck, after the removal from the blowpipe (Lindsey 2011). After
1850, finishing tools which smoothed the inside and top of the lip were commonly used.
The year 1904 marked a significant change from hand-blown bottles to automatic bottlemaking machines. Another technological advancement allowed for the common manufacture
of screw-top bottles and jars. Although screw top bottles had been used prior to the 1800s,
they were considered specialty items and were not common until about 1924 (Polak 1997:24).
Various labeling and decorative techniques such as raised lettering and etching (frosting) were
also used beginning in the 1880s.

Additives caused glass colors to change through time. Aqua, amber, olive green, and brown are
natural colors produced in glass manufacture. However, before 1880, the predominate colors of
bottles glass were shades of green and blue. The standard, natural color of most cheap bottles
produced since the beginning of making glass until about 1900 (and even somewhat later for
medicine bottles) was aqua with varying hues of green and blue. Glass is a mixture of lime,
soda, and sand with traces of iron oxides. When molten, the iron oxides in the sand creating a
chemical which produces the aqua color (Munsey 1970:69; Kendrick 1966:53).
With the exception of “black” glass, glass color was not an important consideration until around
1880 when food manufacturers began adding manganese to the glass as a decolorizer. After
exposure to the sun’s ultra-violet rays, the manganese would change the color of the glass to
amethyst or purple. Manganese worked fine until the outbreak of World War I in 1915 which
led to another defining temporal characteristic to occur in bottles. Prior to 1915, Germany
was a main supplier of manganese. When the war broke out, the supply of manganese was
no longer available to the bottle makers and they resorted to using selenium as a decolorizing
agent. Selenium causes the glass to turn an amber color when exposed to sunlight (Munsey
1970:55; Kendrick 1966:53). By about 1930, the glass manufacturing process was refined so
that neither manganese nor selenium had to be used, resulting in clear glass with no hue. In
addition, milk glass was commonly used in the production of cosmetic and toiletry bottles, and
in ointment/cream jars from the 1870s to the mid-20th century (Lindsey 2011).
Although admittedly problematic—when no other period-diagnostic characteristics were
available—we used glass color, along with personal subjective observation such as thickness,
flaws in the glass, and the degree of patination or corrosion in assigning shards to a particular
time period.

2.3.2 Window Glass
Window glass can potentially be dated. Archaeologist Randall Moir (1988) devised a formula to
date window glass accurate to within a span of 14 years. Moir’s data regression formula yields
a regression coefficient of .93 at a 95 percent confidence level of ±7 years. Quite simply, the
equation uses the thickness modes of window glass found at a site to provide an approximate
date within ±7 years that the glass was manufactured. The equation is: I=84.22(T) +1712.7 (in
which I = the initial date of construction and T = the mean thickness in millimeters). It should
be noted that the regression formula is designed for window pane glass, but not special plate
glass which is usually thicker than the upper 3.3-mm parameter set for window glass (Moir
1988:264).
Obviously, the date of manufacture does not necessarily represent the date the glass was brought
to the site, or the date it was broken, but it does offer a reasonable time frame. By examining
the variations in the thicknesses of glass found on a site, archaeologists are sometimes able to
estimate not only when a house or barn was built, but perhaps even when and how many times
it was renovated. Dating broken window glass shard thicknesses has been used successfully
in south and central Texas (e.g., Gross and Meissner 1997:240–241), and they have also been
correlated with hurricanes near the Gulf Coast (Leezer 2006).

2.3.3 Ceramics
Dinnerware
This section discusses the various types of dinnerware ceramics recovered. They include
decorated and undecorated whiteware, as well as earthenware, a generic term we use here
for modern flowerpots. A small quantity of porcelain and ironstone are also present in the
assemblage.
Whiteware
Whiteware is a highly fired refined clay with a vitreous surface. Whiteware was commonly
imported to America from Britain during the 1800s, but the demand for undecorated type
increased significantly in America by 1860. This type became a common tableware setting for
middle class families in this area of Texas after the 1860s, replacing pewter and wooden wares
(Fox et al. 1989:45), and are still being produced today (Miller 1991).
Ironstone
Ironstone is a highly fired earthenware from about 1860–present in Texas. Also referred to as
“stone china,” “white granite,” and “granite ware,” it can be decorated or undecorated. Highly
fired furnaces enabled the production of ironstone wares around 1813, but they probably
became popular in Texas in the 1850s and 1860s. Raised molded designs began appearing on
ironstone wares about 1875. Like softer fired whitewares, ironstone was a popular, relatively
inexpensive utilitarian kitchenware, but was much more durable and didn’t break as easily. It
is still being produced today (Fox et al. 1989; Kovel and Kovel 2001a, b; Miller 1991).
Porcelain
A small amount of Chinese porcelain imported to Mexico on the Manila galleons is present on
nearly every Spanish colonial site in Texas. It can be differentiated by very careful examination
from European and American porcelain by the very slightly blue gray tint of the body, and
when decorations are present, the grayish blue designs lie beneath the glaze, or delicately
painted orange floral designs lie over the glaze. Porcelain is rarely present on eighteenth and
early nineteenth century sites because the fragile ware had to be transported from Europe (Ivey
and Fox 1981:35), but became more common after 1832, when it was commonly manufactured
in the United States (Barber 1976:126–127).

2.3.4 Nails
Nails can be classified into three main categories: 1) hand wrought, 2) cut with hand hammered
heads or cut with machine-made heads, or 3) wire. Hand wrought nails were commonly used
until the 1800s, falling off in popularity with the introduction of cut nails. Cut nails with handhammered heads were popularly in use between ca. 1790 and 1825, followed by cut nails with
machine-made heads which were commonly used from ca. 1825 to present. Though they were
Ecological Communications Corporation

11

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

introduced prior to the 1850s, wire nails did not become the dominant type until the 1890s
(Nelson 1968:1–10).

2.3.5 Nuts, Bolts, and Screws
Before 1860, nearly all nuts, bolts, and screws made in the U.S. were either made by blacksmiths
or made in small shops using hand tools with limited production. As for bolts, the small shops
used square iron strips and turned them making them round and to add threads. The end of
each piece was left to form the square head. Beginning in 1859, William Clark was granted a
series of patents to manufacture bolts out of round rods, using a machine to fashion the heads.
Nut manufacturing remained much the same, using square rods, bored through and turned
on a lathe to cut the threads, and then cut in small sections. Production was much faster, and
manufactured bolts and nuts were much in demand from that time through the present (Nuts
and Bolts 2011).
The first patented machine to produce screws was designed by Job and William Wyatt in
England in 1760, and they finally opened the world’s first screw factory in 1776. From 1800 to
1860, British screw factories were able to increase screw production from fewer than 100,000
gross of screws per year to nearly 7,000,000 gross per year. The first screw factories in the U.S.
began operating in 1810 in Rhode Island. Pointed screws were developed in 1849, Phillipshead screws were designed and perfected during the period 1860–1890, and the socket-head
screw was designed in 1907. By 1900, the modern screws as we know them today were being
mass produced so that the U.S. was the leading producer of screws in the world (Rybczynski
2000:75–86).

2.4	Prefield Planning
Before the project began the Principal Investigator discussed research issues, field
methodologies, and analysis strategies with members of the SPB and THC to refine fieldwork
and reporting standards. Prior to initiation of actual fieldwork, more detailed archival research,
and examination of soil survey, geology, and topographic maps were used to better understand
the potential for intact soils and cultural features around the Mansion. To ensure systematic
recording procedures, the Principal Investigator archaeologist met with the primary monitor
before the fieldwork began to review feature and artifact classifications, and recording
procedures.
In mid-November 2010, EComm representatives Nick Trierweiler and David Nickels met on
site with THC representatives (Jim Bruseth and Mark Denton), SPB representatives (Dealey
Herndon, Kevin Koch, and Katie Daly), and White Construction Company representatives
(Jerry Ott and Duane Campbell). At this meeting the overall project and scope of work
were discussed in detail to ensure all parties were in agreement on scheduling, notification
procedures, and how the monitoring and recording of features was to be conducted. This
meeting also included a tour of the Mansion grounds with various representatives sharing their
knowledge of buried cultural features previously documented around the Mansion, as well as
12

areas where additional features could potentially be buried. A follow-up examination of the
Mansion grounds was then conducted by Principal Investigator David Nickels and Primary
Monitor D. Emory Worrell on 24 November to review monitoring and recording procedures.

Results of Investigations
During the course of trenching
investigations at the rear of the
Mansion, as well as the monitoring of
multiple trenches and hand-excavated
soils removed by construction workers
on all four sides, a total of eight cultural
features were documented (Table
1), and 191 artifacts were collected
(Appendix B). This section describes
the excavations and monitoring results,
beginning with the west side (rear)
of the Mansion, and working
clockwise around the Mansion
(Figure 7). The features are
described in detail, and uniqueitem artifacts either associated
with features or found as
isolates are also discussed.

3.1.1 Tree Stump
Removal
In January 2011, contractors
began removing a brick wall
forming the perimeter of a raised
bed filled with topsoil around a
large pecan tree stump at the
rear of the Mansion (Figure 8).
It was readily apparent that the
entire 45-foot in diameter raised
bed had been filled with both
construction debris and mottled
soils, before being covered over
with a thin layer of topsoil.

A typical profile, with irrigation pipes is shown in Figure 9. A French drain feature within the
raised bed area was also documented. The rootball on the pecan tree proved to be shallow
and was easily removed with a front-end loader, causing minimal disturbance to the original
ground surface (Figure 10).

Near the southwest portico
pillar was a buried clay
chimney flue with a layered
brick bottom and filled with
gravel. It apparently served
as a French drain off of the
portico roof (Figures 11
and 12). The bottom layer
consisted of one yellow
half, six red halves, and
two red whole bricks. The
yellow
brick
fragment
was manufactured by the
Butler Brick Company in
Austin, using the dry press
technology
(Steinbomer
1982). Six red brick halves
bear the “Abilene” maker’s
mark, indicating they were
made by the Abilene Brick
Company
(Steinbomer
1982). This particular style
was manufactured after
World War II (Williams
2011). The two whole red
bricks bear no maker’s
marks; they are both 7¼
inches long x 3¾ inches
wide, x 2¼ inches thick, not
highly fired, but with crisp
edges (Figure 13).
Artifacts observed within
this area included two
medium size mammal bones,
red and yellow bricks (from

colored glazed tile fragments,
an amber bottle glass shard, a
modern clay flowerpot sherd, and
an unidentifiable ferrous metal
fragment. The two medium sized
mammal bones are a sawn long
bone and a fractured scapula.

Investigations
A second task involved the

trenches at the rear, west side of
the Mansion where plans called
for the construction of a basement
and extended ramp entryway. This
would impact the ground to about
eight feet below the surface at its
deepest (under the patico) with a
sloping ramp to the west. Overall,
the area to be impacted would be
roughly 70 ft x 70 ft (see Figure 7).
A total of 11 trenches of varying
lengths were dug using a backhoe
with a 24-inch bucket while being
carefully monitored for both cultural
features and artifacts (Figure 14).
Excavations revealed that the

with a matrix of grayish roadbase
mixed with red coarse sandy clay.
The approximate 24-inch layer
of gravelly red clay gradually transitioned to red gravelly sand with occasionally light olive
brown clay mottling. Excavations were generally terminated in Pleistocene soils between 36
inches and 54 inches below the rubified red sandy clay surface. A typical trench profile is
shown in Figure 15. The only artifacts observed consisted of an occasional red brick fragment,
a few clear glass shards, and an undecorated whiteware sherd, all within mixed fill.
No historic cultural features were observed. However, a clay sewer pipe with a 3-inch diameter
and brown glazed exterior was discovered in the north wall profile of Backhoe Trench 2 (BHT
2), near its eastern end. It was further encountered near the northern end of BHT 4. It was

set in the bottom of a ditch dug
shallowly into the red clay, and
then covered with dark brown
loam, followed by mixed fill
(Figure 16). Its alignment
suggests that it led from near the
northwest corner of the Mansion
to the south edge of the Carriage
House. It was most likely
installed sometime in the 1930s
through 1950s.
A large metal tank was
encountered near the south
end of BHT 6 (see Figure
14). It was approximately 9 ft
long and perhaps 24 inches in
diameter, with a 1-inch pipe
extending from its northern end.
Excavations were terminated in
this immediate area until it could
be inspected by SBP personnel,
and it was later removed under
hazmat conditions.

Feature 2—
Possible Well
One feature that could possibly
be an abandoned well was
uncovered during the geothermal
trenching phase. Feature 2 was
discovered in the south-central
area of the circular drive while

was
conducting
horizontal trenching west of
the Mansion (see Figure 14).
An excavated pit lined with
dry stacked limestone and
filled with burned matrix was
encountered below one foot of

imported gravel fill. The
limestone rocks lining the
pit appear to be unaltered,
and most measure between
15 to 20 inches in length
and width, with a thickness
between 4 to 8 inches. A
few smaller fragments were
also observed, measuring
between 5 to 10 inches in
length, width, and thickness.
In profile, the feature
measures 5 ft across, from
outside wall to outside wall,
and the rock alignments are
roughly 1 to 2 ft wide on both
sides (Figure 17).

The matrix within the feature
measures 2 to 3 ft in width
and consists of a very dark
grayish brown (10YR3/2)
gravelly clay mixed with ash
and charcoal. This horizon
extends to 3 ft below the
surface at its deepest point
with a rounded profile at the
bottom. The matrix below
that, from 3 to 5 ft, is a strong
brown (7.5YR5/6) gravelly
clay with numerous charcoal
fragments. All elements of
the feature appear to extend
below the trench bottom at 5
ft below the surface. Along

with what appears to be paint
chips dispersed throughout
the feature, only one clear
glass shard and one metal fragment were observed in association with the feature. The glass
shard was recovered from the backfill and the metal item from the bottom of the trench.
Although one possibility is that the feature could be a filled-in well, there are no available
archival records to indicate a well in that area. Nevertheless, the feature was fully documented
with photographs, a sketch map, field notes, and a GPS.

3.2	North
Side
of the

Mansion
A series of geothermal
trenches
and
two
utility trenches were
excavated on the north
side of the Mansion in
addition to hazmat soil
removal in the garden
area (Figure 18). One
feature was documented
within the trenches, as
was a length of clay
sewer pipe. Selected
examples of clay pipe,
yellow bricks, and
stone were collected
for further examination.
In addition a total of
46 glass, ceramic,
and metal artifacts
were collected—all as
isolates within trench
backdirt (Appendix B).

3.2.1 Feature 3—
Garden
Stone Path

area on the north side of the Mansion.

Feature 3 is an exposed section of dry stacked limestone, found in the central area of the North
lawn, just south of the North garden area (Figures 18 and 19). Approximately 20 to 30 tabular
limestone rocks, stacked to a width of about 8 inches, were exposed beneath roughly one foot
of topsoil, just above the gravelly clay horizon. The un-hewn rocks are highly fragmented
with some as large as 12 inches long and 4 inches wide. After discussion with the grounds
keeper, it was determined that this feature was the remnants of an old garden path covered by
landscaping soil within the last 15 years (Hector Medrano, personal communication, June 22,
2011). A similar path was observed on the surface about 15 ft northwest of the feature in the
northwest garden area (Figure 20).

discovered while workers
were removing contaminated
soil from the north border

The pipe was encountered
at approximately 1½ ft
below the surface, running
at roughly 303 degrees. As
more contaminated soil was

drain on the northeast corner
of the house. Measuring
close to 20 ft in total length,
nine 2-ft sections of ceramic
pipe were exposed, along
with one broken section
and one partially buried
section (Figure 21). The
4-inch diameter sections are
connected by bell and spigot
joints with no apparent
sealing mortar. Both the
interior and exterior exhibit a

direction that would lead in
close proximity to the North
Cistern recorded by Prewitt and Associates in 2008. Further investigation would be needed to
determine whether this indeed was a rainwater intake for the North Cistern.

3.2.3
Feature 5—Brick
and Mortar Section
Feature 5 consists of an exposed section
of plastered brick and mortar unearthed at
the north corner of the 1856 structure and
the 1914 addition (see Figure 18). It was
discovered during soil removal while trying
to locate the source of a water leak in this area.
An obvious site of multiple excavations,
construction, and backfilling episodes,
this area was heavily disturbed. Numerous
fragments of ceramic pipe, concrete pipe,
metal pipe, PVC pipe, concrete mortar, and
several Type I Austin Common bricks were
observed. Most of the pipes appear to be
abandoned storm and sewer drains replaced
by plastic PVC piping.

Figure 21. Feature 4 – clay pipeline; facing west.

Figure 22. Feature 5—Brick and
mortar section; facing west.
Ecological Communications Corporation

A section of intact Austin Common brick
and mortar with cement plaster on one side
was recorded (Figure 22). No frogs were
observed on the bricks indicating they may
have been Type 2 bricks. The exposed section
is 10 inches below the surface, measuring
15 inches long, with a width of about 10
inches. It is in an upright position, though
probing by trowel did not reveal evidence
of further extension into the ground. These
construction materials are similar to ones
used in a grease trap recorded by Prewitt and
Associates in 2008. However, the location
of the grease trap is several feet west of the
current feature. In addition, the walls of the
grease trap are about half as thick, and it was
encountered 3 ft below the surface, which
is significantly deeper than the current
feature. It is possible that this represents a
fragment of the original grease trap that was
pushed into this location during previous
renovations.
A section of clay sewer pipe was uncovered
one foot below the surface in the northcentral portion of the north lawn (Figure
23

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

Figure 23. Clay sewer pipe discovered in the northcentral portion of the north lawn; facing southeast.

23; see also, Figure 18). The
ceramic pipe has a very thin
pale grey mortar-like interior
and exterior covered surface.
The interior diameter of the
pipe is 6 inches, and the
sections are connected by bell
and spigot joints. A powdery
layer of debris was observed
in the exposed section of pipe
from where a geothermal
well core punctured it and
sent a mixture of water and
shale running down the
pipe. The pipe is running at
207 degrees, heading in the
direction of the northwest
corner of the original 1856
structure.
The pipe was then “scoped”
with a camera by a technician
hired by the SPB. It is filled
with large gravel at 53 ft, right
at the north retaining wall.
Towards the Mansion it goes
for another approximately
45 ft, and is then filled with
concrete. There were two
downspouts at that northwest
corner of the Mansion, and
it was likely a storm drain
before the retaining walls
were built in 1967.

occasionally scattered within trench backdirt piles on

Yellow Bricks and
Cut Stone

An occasional Type 1 Austin
Common pinkish-yellow brick and pieces of cut limestone were observed along the trench
backdirt piles. These were isolated occurrences and appeared to be within filled, heavily
disturbed contexts. Selected examples are shown in Figure 24. A typical example of Type 1
Austin Common brick collected measures 8 inches long x 3-5/8 inches wide x 2¼ inches thick,
and has a rectangular frog. According to Boyd and McWilliams (2009:81), “Type 1 Austin

24

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

Common bricks with a rectangular frog are the earliest bricks used at the Governor’s Mansion”
“…and it is presumed that all of the bricks used in the 1856 construction are probably Type 1.”
Ceramics
A total of 20 ceramic sherds were recovered. Four unglazed, white earthenware pieces appear
to be from flower pots of an indeterminate age. Ten whiteware sherds were found. Whiteware is
of the less durable and less expensive common ceramic tableware assemblage for middle class
families after the 1860s, replacing pewter and wooden wares (Fox et al. 1989:45). However,
they are still being produced today (Miller 1991, 1993). Three appear to be base fragments
for small bowls, while the other seven are too fragmented for further identification. All are
undecorated except for one piece that has a raised molded design suggesting a post-1875 date
of manufacture (Miller 1991).
Four undecorated ironstone sherds were also found. Like softer fired whitewares, ironstone
was a popular, relatively inexpensive utilitarian kitchenware, but was much more durable and
didn’t break as easily. Although it was commonly imported into Texas in the 1850s and 1860s,
like common whitewares, it is also still being produced today (Fox et al. 1989; Kovel and
Kovel 2001a, b; Miller 1991).
One body sherd of undecorated porcelain was
recovered from the backdirt. Porcelain is a more
expensive, but fragile tableware imported from
Europe beginning in the early 19th century. However,
it became more common after 1832, when it was
commonly manufactured in the United States (Barber
1976:126–127; Ivey and Fox 1981:35).
Other than the raised molded decoration on a
whiteware sherd discussed above, the only decorated
piece of whiteware found on the north side of the

central area of the north lawn. The popularity of Flow
Blue ceramics began in 1835 when they were first
mass produced. They remained popular through the Victorian era, but by 1910 they were no
longer in demand (Snyder 1992:7).
Bottle Glass
A total of 23 bottle glass shards were found. Only three had either a maker’s mark or mold type
indicators. The first is a thick, dark green, heavily patinated body and partial base fragment that
exhibits slightly raised concentric rings on its exterior. The raised rings indicate it was likely
a part of a manufacturing technology that was used from about 1869 through 1903 (Polak
1997:27).

One clear glass jar fragment has a screw top. Its clarity, along with the screw top technology,
suggests it was manufactured after 1930 (Polak 1997:24). The third glass shard with a
diagnostic mark is from a thick, dark brown bottle base, and has a raised capital letter “A” on
it. Mold seams on the base suggest a pre-1903 technology (Munsey 1970; Toulouse 1971).
Although Toulouse discusses two glass manufacturers that used the “A” in raised lettering
as maker’s marks, the bottle color and manufacturing technology of this specimen suggest it
was not manufactured by either of the two. Overall, the attributes of this specimen suggests a
manufacturing period from about 1860 through 1880 (Toulouse 1971:23).
On the remaining 20 shards, although admittedly
problematic, we used glass color, along with
personal subjective observation such as thickness,
flaws in the glass, and the degree of patination or
corrosion in assigning shards to a particular time
period. In that regard, the remaining 20 shards
can be assigned to approximate time periods as
shown in Table 2.

Lightning Rod Glass Insulator
A green-colored glass lightning rod
insulator was collected during soil
removal in the north border garden
area next to a pecan tree (see Figure
18). It bears the name “SPRATT” in
raised lettering. James Spratt opened
a business selling lightning rods,
points, and insulators in Cincinnati,
Ohio in 1848. On February 5, 1850,
he received a patent to produce the
side-type insulator as shown in Figure
26. They were made in both green

and aqua colors. By
1855, he was no longer
in the insulator business
(Insulator Companies
2011; Ohio Lightning
Rod Insulators 2011;
Moulton 2011; National
Insulator
Companies
2011). Based upon these
early dates, this artifact
could conceivably be an
artifact from the original
construction.

Bullet Cartridge

A spent, or fired, .45
caliber brass bullet
cartridge (Figure 27)
was found in soil
removed on the north
border garden (see
Figure 18). It is a center
fire type and is headstamped with “REMUMC” “45 COLT.”
Center fire cartridges
were
produced
beginning about 1858,
and the .45 caliber bullet
and Colt single action
revolver were adopted
for use by the Army
in 1873 (Cartridge
Figure 27. Bullet cartridge, .45 caliber.
Collector 2011). The
head-stamp on this
specimen indicates it
was manufactured by the Remington Arms-Union Metallic Cartridge Company in Bridgeport
Connecticut (Headstamp Codes 2011:45; Logan 1959:61–63). Remington and Union Metallic
were combined into the Remington Union Metallic Company in 1912 at Bridgeport, but the
company was closed in November 1946 (Remington 2011). Although bullets remain in firing
condition for years if stored properly, it is safe to assume that this specimen had to have been
manufactured no earlier than 1912 and no later than 1946.

Composition
material is made from
a mixture or conglomeration of organic materials such as wood fibers or guttapercha latex,
bound together by shellac and rubber (Pool 1987:286). This type of material was commonly
used in the manufacture of buttons in the U. S. between 1875–1925 (Brown 1942:43).
Horse Tooth
A heavily worn horse
tooth was recovered
from an electrical utility
trench excavated on the

Faunal Remains
Four animal bones were observed and collected. Three of the four are fragments from the rib of
a large mammal, with no evidence of cutting, sawing, or burning. The fourth is a sawn segment
of a long bone from a medium size to possibly large mammal. It also exhibits no evidence of
burning.
Metal Spoon
This specimen was found in close proximity to the original Ell Kitchen and the west wing
kitchen that was part of the 1914 addition. It is made from ferrous metal and as shown in Figure
30 is heavily rusted. It may have been enamel-coated, but in its current condition it is difficult
to discern. Mass production of white enamel-coated tinware thrived by the last quarter of the
19th century, but it can still be purchased today (Enamelware History 2011).

and 1914 west wing kitchen addition.

3.3	East Side (Lawn) of the Mansion
A series of geothermal trenches were excavated on the east side of the Mansion, in addition
to hazmat soil removal in the border garden area (Figure 31). One feature was documented
within the trenches, and a total of ten artifacts were collected—all as isolates within trench
backdirt. They include two doll parts, a whiteware body sherd, a marine shell, a cut nail, and
five window glass shards (Appendix B).

3.3.1 Feature 6 – Probable Stone Pathway
Feature 6 is a group of hewn and un-hewn limestone rocks uncovered in the trench excavated
to connect the geothermal pipes to the east side of the Mansion (see Figure 31). The rocks
were unearthed approximately 8 ft east of the northernmost front column, just outside the east
border garden. In profile, the group of rocks measured roughly 6 ft in length, and roughly 1
ft thick (Figure 32). They were encountered at approximately 1 ft below the surface. Most
rocks measured between 5 and 10 inches and appeared to be unaltered; however, two of the
Ecological Communications Corporation

29

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

rocks with distinct cut marks were
collected. In addition, a large,
square, apparently hand-hewn
rock was removed, measuring
approximately 2 ft x 2 ft, with a
width of 4½ inches (Figure 33).
The rocks appeared to have been
dry stacked, and are possibly the
remnants of another abandoned
pathway.
Window Glass

Figure 31. Locations of trenches and Features on east side.

A total of five window glass
shards were found on the east side.
Measurements revealed only one
mode, with a mean thickness of
3.0 mm. Applying this thickness
mean to Moir’s (1988:264) data
regression formula indicates
that the glass was manufactured
sometime between 1958–1972, a
period during which significant
repairs and renovations were
made under the Price Daniel and
John Connally administrations.
Cut Nail
A square, 4½-inch cut nail with a
machine-made head (Figure 34)
was found north of the front stairs
during soil removal in the east
border garden area (see Figure
18). Cut nails with machinemade heads were commonly used
from ca. 1825 to present. Though
they were introduced prior to the
1850s, wire nails did not become
the dominant type until the 1890s
(Nelson 1968:1–10).

Bisque Doll Leg

Figure 33. Square rock removed from bottom of trench.

Figure 34. Square, cut nail.

Figure 35. Bisque doll leg.

Ecological Communications Corporation

This specimen was collected during
soil removal from the east border
garden, north of the front steps
(see Figure 31). The colloquial
term “bisque doll” is a French
word—among doll enthusiasts and
collectors—and is sometimes used
interchangeably with ‘porcelain
doll’ or ‘china doll’ (Bisque Dolls
2011). Bisque is basically an
unglazed porcelain with a matte
finish. Doll heads, arms, and legs
were manufactured and sold as
separate pieces so they could be
attached to cloth bodies. Depending
on how large they were and how
they were accessorized, bisque
dolls could be cheap, or they could
be expensive (Schroeder 1971:94).
Bisque dolls were produced from
the 1840s until after World War I,
with the amount of production and
number of manufacturers increasing
significantly around 1860 (German
and French Dolls 2011).
The specimen shown in Figure 35
is the left leg of an untinted, solid
bisque doll. Its only coloration is
a blue painted garter ribbon in the
upper calf area. A hole in the top
of the hip was for a wire-held joint.
No rust stains are visible around the
hole, indicating that the wire was
likely brass. The bisque is of good
quality, suggesting that the doll was
of good quality also.
On the interior, top of the hip is an
incised mold mark of “80.” A search
of various websites and hard copy
publications indicates that the “80”
mold mark on bisque dolls was used
by two manufacturers. The first was
31

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

used by the Scheutzmeister & Quendt Company in Boldstadt, Germany, beginning in 1891
(Doll Reference 2011a). The second manufacturer to use the “80” mold mark was the William
Goebel Porzellanfabrik factory, beginning about 1892 (Doll Reference 2011b).
The Texas governor occupying the Mansion in the early 1890s was Governor James Stephen
Hogg (1891–1895). Although he had two sons, his only daughter was Ima Hogg, who was born
in 1882, and who would have been nine years old when Governor James Hogg first moved into
the Mansion (Bernard 2011; Cotner 2011).
Porcelain “Frozen Charlotte” Doll Body
This specimen was also collected during soil removal from the east border garden, north of
the front steps (see Figure 31). It is commonly referred to as a “Frozen Charlotte” penny doll,
because unlike the china limb dolls with rotating or moveable parts, the arms and legs of these
dolls were molded permanent. According to St. George (1948:42–45), Frozen Charlotte was a
vain young damsel, who in an American folk ballad, froze to death because she vainly refused
to cover her fancy ballroom dress while on a sleigh ride.
Frozen Charlottes were made entirely out of porcelain from about 1850 through about 1920,
and ranged in size from 1 inch to 18 inches (China Doll 2011). “These little dolls were generally
cheaply made, but some were made of glazed porcelain, decorated with gold colors or other
luster, and were ‘10-cent’ dolls. Most had painted shoes and faces, and many were wigged.
Others had molded hair and some even had molded bonnets. They could be either solid or
hollow. Dolls of this type have been insecurely dated as early as the mid-1850s (Angione
1973:83–84)” (Meissner 1997:61).
As shown in Figure 36, this specimen
found at the Governor’s Mansion
is missing its head, and most of
its arms and legs. Nevertheless,
it is unmistakably a small Frozen
Charlotte doll. Given its wide
range of manufacture, it could have
been a play toy of any of the Texas
governors’ children who lived in the
Mansion from the 1850s through the
1920s.

Marine Shell

Shown at Figure 37 is a Channeled
Whelk shell. It was collected during
soil removal north of the Mansion’s front steps along the east border garden area (see Figure 18).
The Channeled Whelk (Busycotypus canalicalatus) is a common species that inhabits the Gulf
of Mexico coastal bays (Abbott and Dance 1982). As such, it is possible that this specimen was
32

brought to the Mansion grounds
after an excursion to the Texas Gulf
Coast.

3.4	South Side
(Lawn) of the Mansion

Figure 37. Channeled Whelk found
in soils near the front steps.

A series of geothermal trenches
were excavated on the south lawn
of the Mansion, in addition to
hazmat soil removal in the border
garden area (Figure 38). Two
features were documented within
the trenches, and 27 glass, ceramic,
and metal artifacts were collected
(Appendix B).

3.4.1 Feature 7—
Soil Anomaly
Feature 7 is a soil anomaly
discovered along the eastern edge
of the south lawn (Figure 39),
consisting of a yellow (2.5Y6/8)
silty fill starting at approximately
18 inches below the surface. The
deposit is about 4.5 ft long, and
with a width of about 1 ft. No
artifacts were observed in, or near
the feature.

3.4.2 Feature 8—
Trash Deposit

Figure 38. Locations of trenches and
Features on the south side.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Feature 8 was discovered in a
geothermal trench approximately
6 ft northwest of the gazebo
(see Figure 38). A concentration
of burned and buried trash was
uncovered below the topsoil,
within the gravelly clay horizon.
This deposit of cultural material
was first encountered during the
33

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

geothermal well boring
process, which is apparent
in profile, as the well cuts
into the feature (Figure 40).
No artifacts were observed
on the surface, but as the
horizontal trenching reached
the geothermal well, artifacts
began to be uncovered.

Figure 39. Feature 7, soil anomaly on eastern
edge of south lawn; facing east.

Although there did not
appear to be a uniform
shape to the deposit, it was
3 ft at its deepest, starting
at approximately 1 ft below
the surface, and the width of
the deposit was roughly 3 ft
across. The matrix consists
of a dark brown (10YR3/2)
gravelly clay loam with
numerous charcoal and ash
deposits. Artifacts recovered
from the feature included
aqua, brown, clear (slight
amethyst hue), and dark green
bottle glass, unidentified
metal, a horseshoe fragment,
whiteware,
earthenware
(probable modern flower
pot), a ceramic construction
tile, a metal battery post,
cut bone, and several
domesticated pig vertebrae
(whole).

Figure 40. Feature 8—trash deposit northwest of the
gazebo on the south lawn; facing northwest.

In addition, a clear chimney
glass shard that appears to
be from a kerosene lamp or
lantern ‘straight” chimney
was found. The “straight” chimney was commonly used in hall lamps where dim lighting
was preferred. This particular glass shard does not fluoresce when exposed to either long or
short wave ultraviolet light, indicating it does not contain lead; lead was used in lantern glass
before 1864 (Woodward et al. 1984:61; National park Service 2000). The concept of fuel
burning lamps was first patented in 1784, but it wasn’t until 1864 that kerosene became readily
available as a fuel source in the U.S. and kerosene lamps became the norm. Although “straight”
34

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

chimneys on hall lamps can
pre-date the use of kerosene,
they were also continuously
used into the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries
(Woodhead et al. 1984:58,
62).
The base of a whiteware
plate or bowl collected from
within the feature bears a
Homer Laughlin maker’s
mark (Figure 41). The
Homer Laughlin China Co.
was established by Homer
Figure 41. Homer Laughlin maker’s mark.
and Shakespeare Laughlin in
1871. They built a plant on
the banks of the Ohio River in 1873, gaining a reputation for producing some of the first and
finest quality ceramic ware in the United States. The company was sold to William Edwin
Wells and Louis I. Aaron in 1897, who in turn expanded the company to three plants by 1903.
Well known companies, such as the F. W. Woolworth Co. and the American Cereal Co. of
Chicago, were important carriers of this line of dinnerware. The mark reads “Homer Laughlin,”
with “Hudson” underneath, and dates to around 1900 (Homer Laughlin China Company 2011;
Lehner 1988:247–248).
Collectively, the artifacts recovered from Feature
8 can tentatively be assigned to a period of 1880–
1915. A modern thumb tack with a plastic head
and a piece of flagging tape were also recovered,
indicating modern disturbances.

3.4.3 Other Artifacts on the South Lawn
Other artifacts found in trench backdirt on the
South lawn include a plain whiteware shard, two
undecorated ironstone shards, two earthenware
sherds (probable flower pot), brown body and neck
bottle glass shards, a clear glass (no hue) dinnerware
rim sherd, and one window glass shard. The
window glass thickness (3.1 mm) implies a period
of manufacture between 1958 and 1972.
The brown glass bottle neck shown in Figure 42
was collected from geothermal trench backdirt
near the south end of the front porch. It exhibits
Ecological Communications Corporation

Figure 42. Bottle neck.
35

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

a “laid-on-ring”, a tooled plain and broad
sloping collar, and no mold seams. These
characteristics imply an approximate period
of manufacture between 1890 and 1910
(Bottle Finishes 2011).
A layer of construction rubble consisting
of fractured limestone and Austin Common
brick fragments was discovered under the
south-central portion of the South Lawn. It
was uncovered during soil removal along
the south retaining wall down to its footing.
Construction workers removed the soil and
gravel fill that was behind the wall, leaving
the soil cut as it was when the wall was built
in 1967 (personal communication, Kevin
Koch, December 27, 2011). Although not in
the original scope of work, Mr. Koch alerted
EComm archaeologists to the discovery.
Emory Worrell responded and documented
the rubble layer that appeared to be in a
low artificial swale along the wall. It was
roughly 15 inches below the modern surface,
ranged in thickness from 6 to 9 inches, and
extended approximately 25 ft from east to
west (Figures 43 and 44; see also, Figure
38). No other cultural material was observed
in association.

Chapter 4

Summary, Conclusions, and
Recommendations
During the course of trenching investigations at the rear of the Mansion, as well as the
monitoring of multiple trenches and hand-excavated soils removed by construction workers
on all four sides during the period November 2010 through October 2011, a total of eight
cultural features were documented and 191 artifacts were collected. The features consisted of
abandoned stone pathways, a trash deposit, a French drain, a brick and mortar section, a clay
pipeline, a soil anomaly, and a possible stone-lined well. All were impacted to some degree
by the trenching operations, but all except the French drain were generally left in place and
re-buried following utility installation.
Seven of the eight features were either heavily disturbed or are assessed as non-significant.
However, there may have been a well at the rear of the Mansion (Feature 2) that has not
previously been identified either in archival research or subsurface investigations which could
be significant. In that regard, we recommend archaeological investigations be undertaken in
that immediate area before any further soil disturbance occurs in the future.
Many of the 191 artifacts collected proved to be unique, and have provided an array of both
personal and construction items. As a whole, they offer in a continuum an idea of how life was
at the Mansion over the past 150-plus years.
After all of the 191 artifacts were analyzed in the EComm laboratory, it became apparent
that there was redundancy among some items, such as clay sewer pipe for example. Other
items appear to have little or no potential to contribute to our understanding of the history
of the Governor’s Mansion or Texas. These items we recommend be returned to the SPB
for their disposal or storage as they see fit, and they are earmarked accordingly at Appendix
B. Otherwise, we recommend that all other artifacts be permanently curated at the Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory.
Finally, it is evident from this project that although much of the grounds surrounding the
Mansion have been significantly disturbed over the years, there are still discrete pockets of intact
soils, and perhaps cultural features. In addition, the discovery of unique artifacts, regardless of
their contexts, has been able to contribute to the history of the Mansion and its occupants. In
that regard, we recommend that any further construction, or any other soil disturbances that are
to occur on the grounds, be monitored by a qualified archaeologist.

Archaeological Investigations and Construction Monitoring at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, Austin, Texas

During the period of renovation, construction
workers found three whole bottles, and turned
them over to Mr. Kevin Koch of the SPB. Kevin
conducted historical research on the bottles,
and graciously allowed us to photograph them
and present his findings in this appendix. They
have since been returned to Mr. Koch for a SPB
display.

Henkell Sect Champagne Bottle
This bottle (Figures A-1 through A-3) was found
under the library, just east of the fireplace.

This particular bottle of champagne was likely produced in Germany between 1894 and 1908.
In response to an inquiry from Mr. Koch, the following e-mail was received from Ms. Barbara
Burkardt of Henkell-Setkellerei in Germany:

Dear Mr. Koch,
Thank you so much for photos and pictures about an old Henkell Sect bottle that
you found at the Governor’s Mansion, Austin.
The Henkel winery delivered their wines and champagnes ever since 1847 to
the United States, encompassing the vast region between New York, Milwaukee,
down to Galveston.
Although our champagne winery was founded in 1856 in Mainz, Henkell &
Cie did not produce Henkell Trocken right away. Branding – Henkell Trocken
is a brand name – in Germeny was not put into action locally before 1876.
Brand protection on a national level was not possible until 1895. The very
first brand that Henkel created was Henkell Trocken – this was done in 1894.
Henkell Trocken developed from a range of Henkell champagnes, only specified
by the name of their “dosage’, mild, dry, sweet. Henkel Sect Trocken was first
produced beginning in 1856, whereas the champagne with the brand name was
not produced earlier than 1894.
I think your pictures show a Henken Trocken (half size) made between the
early 1890s and 1908, and selling for about $2.00 per bottle. Since 1909, our
champagne was manufactured in Weisbaden; from then on the labels would say
Henkel & Co. Bierbach-Wiesbaden.
Yours,
Barbara Burkhardt

Sharp & Dohme Pharmaceutical Bottle
The specimen shown in Figures A-4 and A-5 is a Sharp & Dohme medicine bottle. It was
also found under the library, just east of the fireplace. The Sharp & Dohme Company was
established in Baltimore, Maryland in 1860, and by 1892 was manufacturing a wide variety
of pharmaceuticals in both liquid and pill form. The mold seam on this bottle indicates it was
machine-made, it would have had an applied paper label, its base has raised lettering “S & D”
and the number “3”; these attributes indicate it was likely manufactured after 1903. Sharpe
& Dohme merged with pharmaceutical giant Merck & Company in 1953 (Bottle Books.com
2011; Scripophily.com 2011).

Martha Washington Wine Bottle
This bottle was found while removing the elevator. The elevator had a concrete retaining wall
around the base of the shaft which was about 3 feet above the basement floor level. The dirt
behind the east wall of the shaft was about 6 feet higher than the basement floor. Construction
worker David Warwick noticed a small crack in the shaft, looked behind the concrete shaft
wall, and saw the bottle in some loose dirt. Mr. Warwick then used a stick to rake the bottle to
the crack in the wall shaft so he could retrieve it.
According to Kevin Koch, the elevator
became non-operational in the early 1940s.
The addition was built in 1914 and at that
time the basement was excavated, leaving
about 6 feet of soil above a retaining wall
adjacent to the 1856 structure. The central
crawl space was shored in the late 1950s,
and the foundation wall was underpinned.
In sum, it would be very hard to tell what
journey this particular bottle took for it to
get to where it was found.
This particular specimen has the words
“EPPSTEIN & SON” “VINTNERS” “FORT
WORTH” in raised lettering near the bottom,
and the number “3” in raised lettering on its
base. Kevin Koch’s research indicates that
the brand name “Martha Washington” was
issued to Milton C. Eppstein, doing business
at the corner of Eighth and Throckmorton
Streets in Fort Worth Texas. Mr. Eppstein
was involved in selling champagne, sherry
and assorted wines (Martha Washington
2011a). In 1912, Milton Eppstein was issued
a federal trademark serial number for selling
these same wares. Notably, the serial number
expired in 1993 (Martha Washington 2011b).

Figure A-6. Martha Washington wine bottle.

The base of the bottle bears a “B” in raised lettering maker’s mark. This is most likely the
maker’s mark used by the Buck Glass Company of Baltimore, Maryland from 1909-1961
(Toulouse 1971:57-58; Elling 2011). Note its ribbed design, paper label, finely machined
and smoothed neck and lip, and the clarity, but with slightly amber hued glass. The labeling,
lettering, and machine technology suggest a post-1903 period of manufacture, while the clarity
of the bottle with a slight amber hue suggests a period of manufacture between 1915 and 1930.
