ABSTRACT
During the months of August and October 2009, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive
linear archeological survey of the City of Amarillo’s Proposed Potter County Well Field in Potter and Carson
Counties, Texas, under Texas Antiquities Permit #5364. The proposed well field consists of approximately 35
miles of water transmission and/or utility corridors and 21 one-acre well pads and a five-acre pumping station.
The project is partially funded through the Texas Water Development Board’s (TWDB) Water Infrastructure
Fund. The survey was completed for compliance with the TWDB’s Environmental Assessment guidelines tied
to the project funding and, since the waterlines, etc., will be installed within permanent and temporary
easements owned by the City of Amarillo, in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code. The project will be
permitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under a Nationwide Permit #12 for utility line activities.
General conditions of this permit require that the project be evaluated for potential impacts to property listed or
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under requirements of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. The investigations included a 100 percent pedestrian survey augmented by
shovel testing in areas having a high probability for sites to occur and areas of low ground surface visibility. A
total of 92 shovel tests were excavated during the course of the survey, and five of these tests were positive for
cultural material. Additionally, archeologists excavated three backhoe trenches on the depositional terraces of
Berry Sand Draw with none containing cultural materials. There are no previously recorded archeological sites
located within the proposed project area. As a result of the survey, four previously undocumented
archeological sites, 41PT490-41PT492 and 41CZ81, were identified in the proposed project area. Sites
41PT490 and 41CZ81 are prehistoric open campsites of unknown age and both exhibit a surficial scatter of
lithic debitage and possibly tools. Sites 41PT491 and 41PT492 are two components of the World War II
training camp called the Ritter Rifle Range. Site 41PT491 is a surficial scatter of fired .45 caliber bullets, while
41PT492 consists of the scant remains of the Boyce family house that was used for target practice during the
Range’s operation. Additionally, surveyors encountered four isolated finds of individual historic and
prehistoric artifacts, a mid-20th century trash burn pile, and an abandoned segment of SH 136 during the course
of their investigations. Based on the results of the archeological survey, it is the conclusion of this report that
Sites 41PT490-41PT492 and 41CZ81, the isolated finds, burn pile, and road bed do not contain deposits that
warrant inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. No standing structures were encountered near the project area during the archeological survey;
consequently, it was determined that the project would have no impact on non-archeological historic-age
resources. Therefore, the Principal Investigator recommends that the proposed development project will result
in no effect upon historic properties and construction should be allowed to proceed. This report is submitted in
partial fulfillment of Texas Antiquities Permit #5364. This survey followed a no-collection policy; however,
project-related notes, photographs, and other documents will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Hicks & Company was pleased to have the opportunity to conduct the archeological investigations of the
Potter County Well Field project north of the City of Amarillo and thoroughly enjoyed the investigations,
the land, and the people. The investigators’ experience was greatly improved through the help of two key
individuals. Scott Honeyfield, P.E., the project engineer with Parkhill, Smith, and Cooper provided
invaluable insight and assistance in laying the groundwork for getting our crew to the area and
coordinating our investigations with the City of Amarillo. Eric Rodriquez, of the City of Amarillo, was
an essential member of our investigative team by contacting various landowners and guiding us through
some very tricky terrain (much to his truck’s chagrin) to our survey corridor, even getting stuck in the
sand on one occasion. Hicks & Company would also like to thank the ranchers and their foremen for
graciously offering their assistance in vehicle extraction if it was ever needed. Finally, thanks are
extended to Chris Caran of the Texas Water Development Board and Ed Baker of the Texas Historical
Commission for providing insights and recommendations for the proposed investigations and reviewing
various correspondences under tight timelines.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION
In August and October of 2009, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive
archeological survey for the City of Amarillo’s proposed Potter County Well Field. The City of Amarillo
is proposing to construct a large water well field that will include 15 to 25 wells, a utility corridor
(consisting of a roadway, base course 12 feet in width, collection pipelines, and overhead power lines
herein after referred to as “utility corridor”), pump station, and water transmission pipeline in eastern
Potter and western Carson Counties, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed project will convey water pumped
mostly from the Ogallala Aquifer (there are other minor aquifers that are also contributory) in Potter and
Carson Counties through a transmission pipeline to water distribution facilities in Amarillo, Texas. The
project will be constructed within a permanent easement obtained by the City of Amarillo and is therefore
subject to the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC). Funding for the project is partially provided by the Texas
Water Development Board (TWDB) through their Water Infrastructure Fund (WIF). Archeological
coordination has been completed to include in a TWDB-Environmental Assessment (EA) that is required
for project funding. The project will be permitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under a
Nationwide Permit #12 for utility line activities. General conditions of this permit require that the project
be evaluated for potential impacts to property listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of
historic Places under requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
The proposed well field and utility corridors are located east and west of SH 136 approximately 14 miles
(22.5 km) northeast of Amarillo, Texas, with the transmission pipeline joining existing infrastructure near
the intersection of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Lake Street in the City of Amarillo. The proposed
project is divided into six segments. Segments 1-3 include the main transmission line, Segment 4 consists
of utility corridors, and Segment 5 includes well pads and a primary pumping station (Figure 1).
Segment 6 is the proposed east-west interconnect line that will join the utility corridors of Segment 4 to
the existing Carson County Well Field Transmission Line. Segments 1-3 of the project will include a 42­
inch main transmission pipeline approximately 18,845 feet (3.6 mi/5.7 km) long in the northern portion,
while the southern portion will incorporate approximately 71,268 linear feet (13.5 mi/21.7 km) of 48-inch
transmission pipeline. Segment 4 will include approximately 18 miles (29 km) of collection pipelines
ranging in size from 10 inches to 42 inches, with associated utility corridors. Segment 5 includes 21 well
pads (each located on one-acre sites), and a primary pump station that will be located on a five-acre site
(Figure 1). Segment 6 measures approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km) in length and is composed of 42-inch
lines. The main transmission line (Segments 1-3) and utility corridors (Segment 4) will typically lie
within a 30-foot permanent easement, with an additional 70-foot temporary construction easement located
to one side of the permanent easement. Therefore, the project area encompasses approximately 35 linear
miles with a 100-foot easement (424 acres) and includes 26 acres for well pads and a pump station (450
acres total). The depth of the trench excavation will vary from about 4.5 feet for the smallest (10-inch)
utility corridors to approximately 7.5 feet for the 48 inch line. At several existing utility crossings, the
trench cut may need to be deepened two to three additional feet. At one existing utility crossing, the
trench will be 15 to 18 feet (3-6 m) deep.
Background research was conducted for this project in May 2009. The results of the background research
indicate that there are no previously recorded archeological sites or previously conducted surveys within
the proposed project area. Two historical trails, the Gregg and Marcy routes of the Fort Smith-Santa Fe
Trail, have been recorded near the proposed project area. In addition, the Alibates Flint Quarries National
Monument is located approximately seven miles north of the project area. The proposed project area was
recommended for an archeological intensive survey based on a lack of the previous investigations in the
area and the high probability for sites to occur.

Introduction

The effects of this project on historic structures has not been coordinated with the THC because initially
there were section 106 triggers for this project. Because the project may require a USACE Nationwide
Permit, the projects effects on historic structures must be considered per Section 106. Segments 1-3 and 6
consist solely of subsurface elements and would have no effect on standing structures. Segments 4 and 5
consist of above-ground elements but are located in open ranch land that has, in most locations, already
been impacted by numerous overhead utility lines and there are no standing structures in the vicinity.
Therefore it is recommended that the project would have no potential to effect non-archeological historicage resources, and an architectural survey is not recommended.
An intensive archeological survey was conducted over 100 percent of the proposed project area and
consisted of a pedestrian survey augmented by shovel tests. Ninety two shovel tests were performed, five
of which were positive for cultural material. Three negative backhoe trenches were also excavated on
various terraces of Berry Sand Draw. As a result of the intensive survey, four archeological sites,
41PT490-41PT492, and 41CZ81, four isolated finds, and one historic trash pile were identified within the
proposed project area. Site 41PT490, likely a prehistoric open campsite, consisted of a surficial scatter of
mostly late stage lithic debitage and a possible hammerstone. Another possible prehistoric open campsite,
41CZ81, was identified and consisted of a surface scatter of lithic debitage and a possible metate
fragment. Site 41PT491 was a scatter of historic age bullets that are associated with a World War II-era
U.S Army Rifle range located west of the project area. Site 41PT492 consists of a crater that marks the
location of the Boyce family home that was used for target practice by the Army. The four isolated finds
consisted of a Scallorn arrow point, lithic debitage, and a fragment of whiteware ceramic. It is the
conclusion of this report that Sites 41PT490-41PT492 and 41CZ81 are not eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places or for listing as State Archeological Landmarks. Therefore, it is the
recommendation of the Principal Investigator that the proposed project will have no adverse effect upon
historic properties.
The fieldwork for this project was conducted between August 18 and August 27, 2009, and October 12
and October 14, 2009. Mason Miller served as the Principal Investigator and John Campbell was the
Project Archeologist. Field crew for the project consisted of Mason Miller, John Campbell, Samantha
Walden, Marin Millen, and Andrew Bryant. The report was written by John Campbell, Mason Miller,
and Samantha Walden. No artifacts were collected during the course of these investigations, however, all
related project materials including, but not limited to, project photos, shovel test forms, backhoe trench
forms, maps, and daily notes will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the
University of Texas in Austin, Texas. This report is submitted in partial fulfillment of Texas Antiquities
Permit #5364.

Environmental Background

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The project area of the Potter County Well Field is located in the southeast section of Potter County and
extends into the far west side of Carson County. The alignment sits on a caprock plain that surrounds
three sides of the Southern High Plains, the other side gradually flattening into the Edwards Plateau
(Sabin et al. 1995). The southernmost portion of the project area reaches an elevation of 3,650 feet mean
sea level; the northern end is measured at a mean sea level of 3,330 feet. Extensive erosion of the caprock
plain caused by the course of the Canadian River creates an area known as the Canadian River Breaks.
This rugged terrain (Figure 2) flattens to the relatively even plains typically associated with the Southern
High Plains toward the city limits of Amarillo (Figure 3).
The prairies, though generally flat, are accented by a few rolling hills and depressions. Among some of
these depressions are playa lakes, numbered at roughly 20,000 in the Southern High Plains alone (Sabin
et al. 1995:290). Their unique natural development in the Blackwater Formation leaves archeologists
debating their exact origin, though it is clear the playas are internally drained (unlike evaporating shallow
lakes), with associated lunettes (mounds of lake sediment) adjacent to the playas. The general consensus
estimates playa lakes to be at least 10,000 years old with some estimated to be up to 35,000 years old.
They are filled with dark gray clay with minimal calcareous deposit, silty to loamy sediment, and sand
(Sabin et al. 1995:290). The exact cause of playas and coinciding lunettes is still in question, but
substrata permeability and playa growth are known to be directly related. A small number of playas were
encountered during survey, all of them occurring outside of the study corridor on the southern half of the
project area.

Environmental Background

Geology
Geological units of the project area include the Quartermaster and Whitehorse Group (Pqw), the Trujillo
(TRdj) and Tecovas (TRdv) of the Dockum Group (TRd), Ogallala (To), and the Blackwater Draw (Qcs)
(Knowles et al. 1984; GAT 1981). These units comprise the High Plains deposits that sit atop Permian
redbeds, the cause of the broken escarpment and irregular land surrounding the area’s creeks and canyons
(Pringle 1980). The oldest unit, the undivided Quartermaster and Whitehorse Group, generally consists
of interbedded sandstone, sand, siltstone, shale, gypsum, and dolomite, and is covered by the Dockum
Group. The Dockum is mainly comprised of red siltstone, sandstone, claystone, and shale. The younger
Ogallala was formed by water in the Tertiary period during the erosion of the Rocky Mountains.
Formation on the uneven existing surface resulted in varied thickness of sand, silt, gravel, and caliche.
This stratum also contains the aquifer for all of the southernmost Great Plains, the Ogallala aquifer, from
which extensive mining has caused significant lowering of the water table levels in the project area
(Knowles et al. 1984). On the Ogallala, the Quaternary-aged Blackwater Draw formed the bedrock
directly underlying the project area during the Pleistocene epoch from eolian deposits of the Pecos River
Valley. It consists of fine- to medium-grained quartz sand with a thickness up to 25 feet.

Soils
Most of the ancient alluvial loam, clay loam, and sandy loam comprising the project area range from deep
to very deep and are generally well drained with moderate permeability. According to the Web Soil
Survey (USDA, NRCS) the soils in the south end of the project area (Segment 1) are characterized as
Pullman clay loam (PuA, PuB and Px). This deep, well-drained soil has high amounts of calcium and
moderate clay. Heavy rainfall during survey, though, caused the matrix to become thicker and more
plastic during shovel testing than in dryer conditions. Continuing north on Segment 2, a mixture of Acuff
loam (AcB and AcC), Paloduro clay loam (PaC), and Oltom clay loam (OcA and OcB) extends deeply as
the land begins to subtly undulate moving toward the Canadian River Breaks area. Segment 3 continues
over rolling, hilly land with soils including: Mobeetie-Veal (MVD), an alluvial and colluvial fine, sandy
loam; Mobeetie-Tascosa (MTE), a fine, sandy, gravelly loam; Likes (LeD), an excessively drained fine

loamy sand; and Tivoli (Tf), an excessively drained fine sand. North of the pumping station (Segment 5)
at the end of Segment 3, the project alignment branches into all directions along Coetas Creek, across SH
136, and back down the highway approximately 2.5 kilometers north of FM 293 (Segment 4). The
Mobeetie-Tascosa and Mobeetie-Veal sandy loams continue to cover the area toward Coetas Creek, while
a small portion of the project area crosses shallower Potter-Mobeetie soil as it nears Alibates Creek.
Segment 6, between Segment 3 and the southern branch of the Segment 4, crosses soils similar to that
seen throughout Segment 3. (Pringle 1980)

Hydrology
The project area lies within the southern portion of the Canadian River Basin with the Red River Basin
beginning just south of the survey alignment. The division between the two rivers runs through Amarillo
heading east-northeast toward Oklahoma, causing the tributaries of the area to flow in opposite directions
depending on their location relative to the basin divide (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). Extending
west from the Red River, Prairie Dog Town Fork lies just south of Amarillo terminating in Palo Duro
Canyon twenty miles (32 km) south of the city (Gibson 1932), while the northernmost portion of the
project area lies just south of Lake Meredith, fed by the Canadian River. Several tributaries flow
southward toward the project area from Lake Meredith, the nearest to the project area being Coetas Creek,
a dry creek bed not included in the investigation but taken into consideration when interpreting the area.
Southwest of Coetas Creek, Berry Sand Draw, a dry creek bed with high potential for artifacts, intersects
the project area just south of the main pumping station. Unexpectedly deep loamy sediment and very
rugged terrain characterize this area; further investigation of Berry Sand Draw is discussed later in this
report. Stalanaker Lake, a large playa lake, is just west of Segment 2 and was full at the time of survey, as
were other minor playa lakes in the area. Beyond Berry Sand Draw and nearby Coetas Creek, none of the
tributaries from the Canadian or Red River significantly affect the project area. Their proximity, though,
theoretically poses an area suitable for prehistoric or historic inhabitance.

Climate
Overall, the area experiences a dry, steppe climate consistent with the rest of the Southern High Plains.
Rainfall is variable both monthly and annually, occurring mainly in thundershowers between May and
October. An unusually wet summer at the time of survey had left many of the flat fields mucky with
standing water and a high density of mosquitoes. Winters are relatively mild with temperatures dropping
below 32 degrees only during short-lived cold spells. This leaves nearly 200 days of growing season,
with the last freeze roughly coinciding with the beginning of spring thunderstorms (Pringle 1980:2-3).
Most notable during survey were the unrelenting winds that blow across the flat plains. Average wind
speeds in the area range from 16 to 24 kilometers per hour with gusts up to 80 kilometers per hour (Sabin
et al. 1995:287).

Flora and Fauna
Of the 91,000 square kilometers of High Plains, approximately half of the area is grasslands (Knowles
1984). McMahan (1984) describes the vegetation specific to the area as Mesquite Brush, MesquiteJuniper Brush, and Mesquite Shrub/Grasslands (the most prominent). The Mesquite Shrub/Grasslands
(Figure 4) include narrow-leaf yucca, grassland prickly pear, purple three-awn, buffalo grass, and little
bluestem, along with a wide range of other grassland species. Crops are a large portion of the vegetation
in the area as well. Corn and grain sorghum are the most common row crops, while soybeans and sugar
beets require favorable conditions as well as extensive irrigation (Pringle 1980:33-37).

Environmental Background

Within Potter and Carson Counties alone, the Cooperative Wildlife Collection (TAMU 2009) reports one
species of salamander, 12 species of frogs and toads, four species of turtles, 10 species of skinks and
lizards, and 21 species of snakes. Among these, common species include the Texas horned lizard, plains
black-headed snake, and the Great Plains skink. The grasslands support a number of mammal species as
well, from the black-tailed prairie dog and the black-tailed jackrabbit to the white-tailed deer and whitethroated woodrat. During survey, several pronghorn antelope were also spotted, along with desert
cottontail and various species of pocket mice. Historically, bison are associated with the area, though
none were observed during the project area survey. Birds common to the area include the roadrunner,
field sparrow, lesser prairie chicken, burrowing owl, and mourning dove.

Land Use
While much of the project corridor is characterized as open ranch land evidence of construction, utilities
and gravel mining indicated extensive historic and modern land use in the area. Sub-terrain facilities such
as pipelines and oil and gas operations and surficial disturbance such as overhead power lines, roadways,
and agricultural and industrial activities were prominent at numerous locations. In all other areas the
landscape, was generally open and unaltered.
The land within the southern portion of the project area consists primarily of level, plowed fields and land
used for livestock grazing. Significant disturbance was evident on the surface, especially after rain.
Cattle tracks, along with some deer, jackrabbit, prairie dog, and other mammal tracks were clearly seen on
surfaces with high visibility. Just outside of the project area are sorghum crop fields, though no crops
were grown within the immediate survey alignment. A modern railroad passes through the fields at the
northern end of Segment 1. Gravel traces and rail parts can be seen in the area surrounding the 15-foot
railway mound bisecting the open land. Remnants from an old railroad are also visible in Segment 1
toward the intersection of SH 136 and the SH 335 Loop. The disturbed land still shows the path of the
original railroad up to this intersection and out of the project area extending northeast. The land toward

Environmental Background

the middle of the project area (Segments 2-3 and Segment 6) generally consists of plowed fields and
livestock grazing land as well. As the alignment approaches the highway again (Segment 4), a cut road
(location of Site 41PT490) runs along the east side of SH 136 and continues through much of the northern
portion of the project area through plowed fields. Continued use of the road is apparent in the deep tracks
and newly hardened soil within the roadway. At the northern end of the project area, the utility corridors
leading out to the proposed well sites cross land used for cattle grazing on both the east and west sides of
the main alignment. Several well sites had already been constructed; at these sites, the soil was densely
packed and deeply cracked from the weight of the construction equipment used. Tire tracks were visible
where the path of the utility corridors deviated from existing two-track or dirt roads.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The proposed project area is located in the Southern High Plains in the panhandle of Texas. Johnson and
Holliday (2004) divide the cultural chronology of this region into five general periods: Paleoindian
(11,500 to 8,500 B.P.); Archaic (8,500 to 2,000 B.P.); Ceramic (2,000 B.P. to ca. A.D. 1450);
Protohistoric (ca. A.D. 1450 to 1650); and Historic (A.D. 1650 to the present). The Ceramic Period is
also referred to as the Plains Woodland Period (Johnson and Johnson 1998). Other archeologists have
further subdivided some of these periods based on variations in regional archeology and they are
discussed below.
An important feature near the project area is the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument. These
quarries are the location of more than 700 hand dug flint quarries concentrated on roughly 60 acres that sit
atop a mesa. The unique flint quarries were used as a source of raw materials for weapons and tools by
prehistoric cultures spanning 12,000 years (NRHP 2009). In addition to the quarries, the site is
surrounded by campsite locales and petroglyphs (NRHP 2009). Alibates Flint Quarries National
Monument is located approximately seven miles north of the project area.

Paleoindian Period (11,500 to 8,500 B.P.)
The Paleoindian Period emerges in the archeological record near the end of the Pleistocene and continues
into the Early Holocene. The climate at this time was cooler and moister with lower fluctuations in
seasonal maximums, allowing for a more diverse range of species (Hofman 1989). This period is
characterized by an economy of big game hunting and nomadic settlement patterns as well as the
utilization of large fluted and unfluted lanceolate projectile points. This period can be further divided into
Clovis (11,500 B.P. to 11,000 B.P.), Folsom (10, 800 B.P to 10,300 B.P), and Late Paleoindian (10,000 to
8,500 B.P.) (Johnson and Holliday 2004).
All of these substages have similar patterns in settlement, subsistence, and lithic technology. The
variations in these substages is reflected by a shift from large game hunting (mammoth, extinct bison, and
camel) with fluted projectile points during the Clovis substage to the hunting primarily of extinct bison
and the adoption of a more diverse tool kit represented at Folsom sites and unfluted points of the Late
Paleoindian. The Folsom tool kit, in addition to fluted points, included bifacial knives, spurred
endscrapers, gravers, and other flake tools that were highly curated and conservative in its manufacture
(Hofman 1989; Hofman and Graham 1998). In the Late Paleoindian stage, unfluted, parallel flaked,
lanceolate points emerge, along with bone and stone anvils, bone needles, and flake knives, while
subsistence remains consistent with the earlier Folsom stage (Mercado-Allinger 2004).
Paleoindian sites in the Southern High Plains are generally characterized as kill and butchering sites or
camp sites (Holliday 1997). Although kill locations and butchering locations may be separate (Johnson
1997), these sites tend to occur in the archeological record in valleys close to waterways, while camp sites
are more often found in upland settings along valley margins and near playa lakes (Holliday 1997;
Johnson 1997). Some notable Paleoindian sites in the region include the Blackwater Draw Locality #1 in
northeastern New Mexico, Lake Theo southeast of Amarillo, the Miami Site northeast of Amarillo, and
Lubbock Lake, south of Amarillo.

Archaic Period (8,500 to 2,000 B.P.)
The archeological record for the Archaic Period in the Southern High Plains is sparse and few sites have
been excavated that give only a small picture of life during the Archaic. One of the main characteristics

Archeological Survey – Amarillo Potter County Well Field – January 2010

13

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

of this period is the shift from the wetter mesic climate of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene to
more xeric conditions and eventually widespread drought and aridity during the Altithermal (7,500 to
5,000 B.P.) (Meltzer 1999). The increased drought and aridity saw an increase in aeolian erosion and
deposition, which would have effected site preservation, evidenced at Lake Theo (Harrison and Killen
1978) and may account for gaps in the archeological record (Johnson and Holiday 2004). The primary
economy of the Early Archaic Period appears to be focused on modern bison hunting as evidence from
Blackwater Draw Locality No.1, San Jon (New Mexico), and Lubbock Lake suggests (Kay 1998),
however as the climate became drier and bison populations were reduced, subsistence appears to diversify
to more lower ranked resources during the Middle Archaic (Meltzer 1999). Adaptations to the changing
environment suggest a less mobile hunting and gathering population “tethered” to limited water sources
(Hofman 1989), regional abandonment of drier areas, utilization of locally available lithic resources, and
wider use of new technologies (Meltzer 1999). Lithic assemblages during the Archaic Period are
characterized by the dominance of expedient cores and flakes, but also the occurrence of more formalized
tools (Hofman 1989). Heat treatment of chert also emerges during this time, possibly as a response to the
lower quality of locally available chert (Harrison and Killen 1978; Hofman 1989). Ground stone artifacts,
such as manos and mortars, are also common during this period (Hughes and Willey 1978) and further
suggest a shift in diet and specialized plant processing. Another technological adaptation during the
Middle Archaic was the use of water wells, which have been reported at Blackwater Draw Locality No. 1,
Rattlesnake Draw (New Mexico), and Mustang Springs (south of Lubbock) (Johnson and Holliday 2004;
Meltzer and Collins 1987).
Climate conditions begin to ameliorate during the Late Archaic bringing about a rise in bison populations
and a more stable landscape (Johnson and Holliday 2004; Meltzer 1999). Diversified subsistence and
short term settlement remain consistent with that of the Middle Archaic with the exception of increased
bison exploitation. The number of Late Archaic sites in the archeological record also increase as a result
of the more stable environment. Overall the Archaic period is a period of adaptation to changing
environmental conditions. These adaptations are characterized by a change in subsistence, a more
dynamic tool kit, and the utilization of more locally available resources.

Ceramic Period (2,000 B.P. to CA. A.D. 1450)
This period is also referred to as the Plains Woodland Period and represents both a technological shift and
a shift in settlement or mobility. The major characteristic of this period is the introduction of the bow and
arrow and ceramics (ca. 1,830 to 1,700 B.P.) to the region (Johnson and Holliday 2004; Johnson and
Johnson 1998). Three phases are recognizable during this period and consist of a Transitional Archaic
period, the Palo Duro Complex, and the Antelope Creek Phase. Evidence of the transition from the Late
Archaic is seen at the Blue Clay and Deadman’s Shelter sites southeast of the project area which included
deposits containing dart points, corner-notched arrow points, and ceramics (Hughes and Willey 1978) and
at the Sanders site which contained dart points and cord-marked pottery (Johnson and Johnson 1998).
This transitional period does not differ dramatically from the Late Archaic in that subsistence is still
focused on bison and other low order resources. In addition, these transitional groups are still relatively
mobile, utilizing camps on a seasonal basis (Johnson 1997; Johnson and Johnson 1998).

Palo Duro Complex
The Palo Duro complex emerges in this region around A.D. 500 and continues to around A.D. 1,200
(Boyd 2004). The Palo Duro people are considered to have been a semi-sedentary group occupying the
Caprock Canyonlands at the headwaters of the Red and Brazos Rivers (Boyd 2004). The remains of this
group generally manifest in three types of sites, campsites, rockshelters, and residential bases (Boyd
2004). Notable features of this period include pithouse features, storage pits, arrow points, Mogollon

Archeological Survey – Amarillo Potter County Well Field – January 2010

14

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

brownware ceramics, and burials. The economy of the Palo Duro complex shifts away from bison
hunting as a primary activity and broadens its subsistence spectrum with more of a focus on antelope,
deer, and plant subsistence, and possibly limited horticulture (Boyd 2004). The nature of Palo Duro
complex sites varies in function and intensity and reflects seasonal use, abandonment, and reuse (Boyd
2004).

Antelope Creek Phase
The Antelope Creek phase occurs between approximately A.D. 1,200 and 1,500 and represents a mix of
stone slab architectural sites, open camps, and rockshelters concentrated around the valleys and tributaries
of the Canadian and North Canadian Rivers (Drass 1998; Brooks 2004). The Antelope Creek culture is
most characterized by the use of stone slab architecture in the construction of multi-room and single-room
houses occurring as homesteads, small hamlets, or large villages (Drass 1998). Pit features found at the
Alibates quarry are also likely associated with the Antelope Creek phase (Drass 1998). The more
permanent sites occupy steep terraces, valley walls, alluvial terraces, and occasionally high mesas (Drass
1998; Brooks 2004). Storage pits, bell and basin shaped, are common around structures and burials can
occur inside house structures or in hilltop cemeteries near villages (Drass 1998). The subsistence of these
groups was focused on horticulture, gathering, and hunting (Brooks 2004). The lithic assemblage from
these sites is a mix of expedient and curated tools (Brooks 2004) that included small corner and side
notched arrow points, ovate, beveled knives, drills, and scrapers (Drass 1998). Ceramics are
predominantly Borger Cordmarked vessels consisting of thin, heart shaped jars with wide mouths (Drass
1998). The Antelope Creek phase disappears quickly from the archeological record as settlements shift
from multi-room houses to primarily single room houses and from the major floodplains to springs, and
subsistence becomes more focused on bison; this disappearance may be attributed to climate change
(Brooks 2004).

Protohistoric (CA. A.D. 1450 to 1650)
The Protohistoric period in the panhandle is marked by two distinct cultural complexes, the Tierra Blanca
complex and the Garza complex (Mercado-Allinger 2004). The Tierra Blanca complex is found primarily
along the Canadian and Red Rivers and likely occupied much of the area around the Alibates quarry
beginning in A.D. 1,450 (Vehik 2002). Artifacts associated with the Tierra Blanca complex include
glazed-polychrome and plain utility wares, Washita, Harrell, and Fresno arrowpoints, beveled knives,
“snub-nosed” end scrapers, and side scrapers (Hogan 2006; Mercado-Allinger 2004). Trade with the
Pueblo groups in New Mexico is evidenced both by a large amount of glaze-polychrome wares (Hogan
2006; Mercado-Allinger 2004) and an increase of alibates agatized dolomite at Pueblo sites coinciding
with the emergence of the Tierra Blanca complex (Vehik 2002). Two sites types are recognized in
association with this complex, large villages and hunting camps (Hogan 2006). Large village sites are
characterized by the presence of stone foundations of jacal structures (Hogan 2006).
The Garza complex generally occurs further to the south around Lubbock Lake (Johnson and Holliday
2004) and the headwaters of the Brazos River (Hogan 2006), although it may have extended as far north
as Palo Duro canyon (Johnson and Holliday 2004). The Garza complex appears between A.D. 1,550 and
1,700, but may have appeared earlier (Hogan 2006). Artifacts from Garza complex sites are similar to
that of the Tierra Blanca, but also include basally notched Garza and Lott points (Hogan 2006). Sites
from this complex are generally temporary camp sites, but evidence from Bridwell Site of an artificial,
circular embankment suggests more permanent villages (Hogan 2006). Trade with the Pueblo groups in
New Mexico is also common among the Garza complex as trade wares similar to those found at Tierra
Blanca sites are also found at Garza sites (Mercado-Allinger 2004).

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

Both the Tierra Blanca and Garza cultures likely had similar subsistence and settlement patterns. Hogan
(2006) suggests these groups were likely semi-sedentary groups that primarily focused on bison and
possibly limited horticulture (Chipman 1992). When the Coronado expedition crossed the region in 1541,
they described two groups of bison hunters in the southern plains, the Querechos and the Teyas, which
lived in tipis and used dogs for transport (Chipman 1992; Hogan 2006). These two groups are considered
to represent the Tierra Blanca (Querecho) and Garza (Teya) cultural groups. Furthermore, the Querechos
are considered to be Plains Apache and the Teyas (Hogan 2006) are likely a western extension of the
Plains Caddo or Wichita groups (Drass 1998).

Historic (A.D. 1650 to the Present)
The Apache emerge as the predominant cultural group in the southern plains up until the mid 18th century
(Chipman 1992). The Lipan Apache continue with a semi-nomadic life way focused on bison hunting
and tipi and wikiup residences, but also adopting the horse, primarily as a food resource (Chipman 1992;
Hanson 1998). In the early 18th century, the Comanche arrive in the Panhandle of Texas and force the
Lipan Apache south into the Edwards Plateau (Chipman 1992). Joined by the Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache
in the early 19th century, these groups maintained a nomadic settlement pattern focused on bison hunting.
In addition, the Comanche maintained constant warfare with both the Lipan Apache and the Anglo
settlers entering the region (Mercado-Allinger 2004). The Comanche and its allies were eventually
displaced from the region by the U.S military in the 19th century.
The first Anglo-Europeans and Anglo-Americans to reach the panhandle were the Spanish explorers in
the 16th century. During the 19th century the area was increasingly occupied by buffalo hunters, Indian
traders (comancheros), sheep herders (pastores), and military personnel (Mercado-Allinger 2004). Adobe
Walls is a historic trading post that operated in the 1860s and 1870s along the Canadian River (Johnson
and Holliday 2004) and Tecovas Springs was utilized by comancheros and New Mexican pastores
(Anderson and Leffler 2009). The Gregg and Marcy routes of the Fort Smith-Santa Fe Trail passed
through Potter County and were established by Josiah Gregg in 1840 and Colonel R.B. Marcy in 1849.
These trails were used by gold seekers heading west to California and later by military and stage lines
(Texas Historic Sites Atlas 2009a; 2009b).
Near the end of the 19th century the majority of Potter County was established as ranchland. The Fort
Worth and Denver City Railway came across the county in 1887 prompting locals to establish Potter
County and the city of Amarillo as the county seat (Anderson and Leffler 2009). Plant agriculture
became more widespread between 1900 and 1910 focusing mainly on corn, sorghum, and wheat. In
1918, a gas field was discovered northwest of Amarillo as well as oil deposits in nearby Hutchinson
County; many oil companies soon headquartered in Amarillo (Anderson and Leffler 2009). During the
Great Depression and the accompanying Dust Bowl, many oil companies and farmers went out of
business and Amarillo became the regional center for the administration of New Deal Programs
(Anderson and Leffler 2009). During World War II new jobs came to the area through the construction of
the Amarillo Army Air Field (later Amarillo Air Force Base) and the Pantex Munitions Plant (Anderson
and Leffler 2009). Following the war the economy remained largely ranching and farming with the
addition of the manufacturing of helium, natural gas, oil, and sand and gravel (Anderson and Leffler
2009).

Previous Archeological Investigations
The background research for this project determined that there are no previously recorded archeological
sites and no previously conducted surveys within the project area. However, there are two previously
recorded sites (41PT140 and 41PT141) and four previously conducted surveys within one mile of the

project area. In addition, two historical markers associated with historic trail routes are located
approximately two miles from the project area and the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument is
located approximately seven miles to the north of the project area.
The two previously recorded sites in the vicinity of the project area are located just south of SH 136 near
the southern end of the project area. No information regarding the sites was available on the Atlas.
However, the sites are located within the boundaries of previously conducted survey by Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Amarillo (Clements) Unit
(Schroeder and Rader 1995). The survey report states that site 41PT140 and 41PT141 are prehistoric
lithic scatters with no definable features or temporally diagnostic artifacts. The sites did not meet the
criteria for listing on the NRHP. No other sites were recorded during the survey.
Limited information was available on the three remaining surveys besides the dates of the surveys and
their general locations. A survey conducted by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) in 1975
is located along Grand and Eastern streets near the southern terminus of the project transmission line. No
sites are recorded in the vicinity of the survey. A small survey located near the US 60 and SH 136
intersection is located about a mile south of the southern project terminus. The survey is likely related to
the US 60/ Atchinson, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad overpass conducted by the Federal Highway
Administration and TxDOT in 1991 (TxDOT 1991). No sites are recorded in the vicinity of the survey.
The remaining survey is identified in three separate locations near the southern end of the project area.
One of these locations appears to be located just over 200 m south of the project area near its intersection
with SH 136. No sites are in association with this survey location or the other two locations, which are
located beyond a mile north of the project area.
The two historical markers are for the Fort Smith-Santa Fe Trail and Gregg and Marcy routes. The routes
mark the location of the overland route connecting the river ports of Fort Smith and Van Buren, Arkansas
with Santa Fe, New Mexico (Texas Historic Sites Atlas 2009a; 2009b). The northern Marcy route marker
is located 1.6 miles north of the northern most proposed well location while the southern Gregg route
marker is located 2.7 miles southeast of its closest proximity to the project area. Both markers are located
in the vicinity of traces and ruts related to the overland route. During the fieldwork conducted for this
project the Marcy route marker was missing.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
This section presents field methodology for the Phase I archeological investigations of City of Amarillo’s
proposed Potter County Well Field. All investigations were conducted in accordance with the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and 36 CFR 800, the Texas Antiquities Code (13 TAC
26), the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation
(48 FR 44716-44742), and the Secretary’s Standards for Identification (48 FR 44720-44723), and TAC
#5264.
To complete the archeological investigations along all linear project segments, archeologists traversed the
alignment on foot and visually inspected the ground surface for surficial evidence of archeological
deposits. Surveyors followed two 10-meter interval transects along the project corridor. Despite
unusually heavy rains in the region prior to the current investigations that produced denser than normal
vegetation, ground surface visibility tended to be good to excellent (50-80 percent), particularly with
distance to the north. As such, surficial inspection was the primary means of archeological investigation
for this survey. In locales where surface visibility was less than 40 percent (particularly along the
southern third of the study alignment), archeologists excavated shovel tests at a rate of 16 tests per linear
mile. In addition, one shovel test was excavated at each proposed well location regardless of surface
visibility or soil deposits in an effort to gather an accurate summary of soils throughout the project
corridor. Additionally, archeologists excavated shovel tests at a rate of 2 tests per acre within the
proposed 5-acre pumping station. All shovel tests were excavated to a depth of one meter, to bedrock, or
to clearly sterile subsoils before terminating. Shovel tests for this survey rarely reached the maximum
depth, generally contacting sterile subsoils or bedrock above the one-meter mark. Soils within each
shovel test were screened through ¼-inch metal hardware cloth, and results of tests were summarized on
standardized forms. Each shovel test was marked with handheld and sub-meter GPS units and plotted on
field maps.
Archeologists excavated a total of three backhoe trenches along various depositional terraces of Berry
Sand Draw. Each trench measured approximately four meters long and was dug to clearly sterile subsoil
(BHTs 1-2) or clearly disturbed contexts (BHT 3). Soil from each trench was screened through ¼” mesh
and briefly documented through notes, profiles, and photographs, then refilled.
All archeological deposits were investigated in a manner that was appropriate to the condition of the
deposits themselves. With Sites 41PT490, 41PT492 and 41CZ81, archeologists excavated at least five
subsurface shovel tests while investigating the sites in an effort to identify the subsurface nature and the
horizontal extent of those deposits. Site 41PT491 was clearly a single-component historic archeological
site that bore no potential for subsurface deposition. As such, the site was investigated and recorded
solely from surficial inspection alone. Sites were evaluated using the NRHP criteria of significance (36
CFR 60.4). The NRHP criteria are as follows:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects of state and local importance that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and
a) that are associated with the events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

Methodology

c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic value, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
d) that yielded, or may be likely to yield, information on prehistory or history.
Typically the most applicable criteria for evaluating archeological properties is criterion d. In general,
prehistoric and historic sites containing subsurface deposits in the form of features or middens that are
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP fall within criterion d. Sites that are viewed as likely to contain intact
subsurface deposits are determined by occupation intensity, function or type of site, and the degree of
disturbance. Site integrity and condition are key factors in evaluating NRHP significance. Criteria
considerations: ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures; properties owned by
religious institutions or used for religious purposes; structures that have been moved from their original
locations, commemorative in nature; and properties that have achieved their significance within the past
50 years shall not be considered eligible for the NRHP (36 CFR 60.4).
Additionally, archeological sites were evaluated for potential SAL eligibility through the TAC’s
evaluation criteria as outlined in the “Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas,
Chapter 26, Section 26.8):
1) the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history of
Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2) the site’s archeological deposits and artifacts within the site are preserved and intact, thereby
supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history
4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby
contributing to new scientific knowledge
5) the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur and official
landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal protection, or alternatively further
investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site
cannot be protected.
Archeologists followed a no-collection policy. All artifacts encountered in the field were observed,
briefly documented through notes, photographs, and/or drawings, and then returned to their find location.
All project-generated notes, forms, photographs, and other materials will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

Results of Investigations

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive survey over the entire proposed project
area. In general, the project area consisted of high, rolling upland plains dissected by numerous shallow
drainages. The project area follows the divide between the drainages of the Red and Canadian Rivers in
the southern half and then turns to the north into the Canadian River drainage system. Berry Sand Draw
is the only major drainage traversed by the proposed project area, however, Coetas Creek lies
immediately north of the project area and Stalanaker Lake (a playa lake) is located just west of the project
area. The project area was mostly in pasture with short grasses, cactus, and yucca affording generally
good to excellent surface visibility. Shovel testing augmented the pedestrian survey in areas of low
ground surface visibility or areas that had a high probability for sites to occur. Ninety-two shovel tests
were excavated, five of which were positive for cultural material. Four archeological sites, 41PT490­
41PT492 and 41CZ81, were identified as a result of the survey as well as four isolated finds and a mid
20th century trash burn pile.
For the purposes of this investigation, the project area of the Amarillo Potter County Well Field was
divided into six segments. Segments 1-3 include the main transmission line, Segment 4 consists of utility
corridors, and Segment 5 includes well pads and a primary pumping station. Segment 6 is an additional
transmission line called the Carson County Interconnect which links the well field to additional
infrastructure in the neighboring county. The proposed main transmission line runs roughly northnortheast across farm land and flat prairies into rangeland with more relief and native vegetation,
terminating at the primary pumping station. From the primary pumping station emerge two sets of
branched utility corridors, the west collection line and the east collection line. Descriptions of the
individual segments are provided below.

Segment 1
Segment 1 begins just north of 24th Avenue on the north side of Amarillo at a water pumping station
(Figure 5) and tank operated by the City of Amarillo and proceeds north and east for approximately 4.5
kilometers. The portion of this segment between 24th Avenue and SH 136 is primarily pasture land with
short grasses. The project area follows two-track roads over the majority of this portion. At SH 136 the
segment turns northeast and lies within a former railroad bed until crossing into pasture at St. Francis
Avenue. Approximately 2.5 kilometers northeast of St. Francis Avenue is the termination of Segment 1,
where the proposed project area turns due north. For most of Segment 1, the proposed project area is
adjacent to property fences along two track roads. Disturbances noted in this segment include the former
railroad berm, dumping, road grading, a power substation, and some minor disturbances from residential
development.
Thirteen shovel tests were excavated in Segment 1, and none of these were positive for cultural material.
Shovel testing was limited due to disturbance, high ground surface visibility (0 to 70 percent), and
pastures with standing water. Soils observed in this segment consisted of an upper plow zone of very
dark, grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty sandy loam overlying dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) silty clay
loam. The majority of the shovel tests bottomed out into yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), dense, carbonitic
silty sandy clay between 40 and 70 centimeters below ground surface. No cultural resources were
identified within this segment.
This segment consists of subsurface elements only and has no effect potential to non-archeological
historic-age resources.

Segment 2
Segment 2 extends for approximately five kilometers north to south between SH 136 to just north of
Stinnett Road (Figure 6). The southern half of this segment is all short grass pasture and numerous
prairie dog towns. The project area in this southern half follows a remnant fence line consisting of a very
low berm and a few fence posts. A transmission line crosses the project area at the south end parallel to
SH 136. The northern half of this segment is owned by Xcel Energy, which operates a number of water
storage ponds on the property, although none are in the proposed project area. This northern half was
plowed at the time of survey, but nothing was planted. Disturbance in Segment 2 was very minimal and
confined to the transmission line, El Rancho Road and the minor disturbance of the prairie dog towns
(although this disturbance may be more severe below ground). Stalanaker Lake is also located just west
of Segment 2 and is a large playa lake.
Three shovel tests were excavated in this segment and all were negative for cultural resources. The
limited shovel testing was due primarily to the high ground surface visibility (80 to 100 percent) within
the segment. The soils in this segment consisted of dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) sandy clay loam
overlying dense, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy clay around 40 centimeters below the ground surface.
No cultural resources were identified within this segment.
This segment consists of subsurface elements only and has no effect potential to non-archeological
historic-age resources.

Segment 3
Segment 3 begins just north of Stinnett Road and extends 14.5 kilometers northeast until terminating at
the proposed main pumping station, loosely following an existing overhead transmission line (Figure 7).
Portions of the segment that cross Berry Sand Draw were backhoe trenched in order to further test for
buried cultural remains. The terrain in Segment 3 shifts from the plowed fields and pastures in the
southern portion of the overall project area and transitions mainly of rolling plains with roughly cut
drainages. Erosion is the main source of disturbance of the land in this area, especially in and around the
drainages and along terrace edges. Short grasses and yucca were the primary vegetation in the area,
though lower areas were usually covered with taller grasses.
Thirteen shovel tests were conducted along Segment 3. The portion of the alignment crossing through
Berry Sand Draw had the highest potential for cultural materials. The segment crosses the northernmost
tip of the draw and its associated ridges, terraces, and lowlands (Figure 8). The middle of the segment
hints at nearby Berry Sand Draw as the rolling hills slope more steeply down toward the drainage.
During heavy rains, Berry Sand Draw fills and erosion of the surrounding sandy soils continues to slowly
change the modern landscape. Six shovel tests were excavated within the draw area, and all were
negative for cultural resources. Two backhoe trenches were also excavated during October of 2009 near
Berry Sand Draw (see Backhoe Trenching section). Surface visibility varied between 10 to 50 percent
depending on location. Shovel tests were concentrated in areas with lower visibility and within the
sediment deposits in the draw. Soils in this segment consisted of reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loamy sand on
terraces and course tan (7.5YR 5/4) sand within the drainage. No cultural resources were identified
within this segment.
This segment consists of subsurface elements only and has no effect potential to non-archeological
historic-age resources.

Seven shovel tests were conducted throughout the rest of Segment 3; all were negative for cultural
resources. Overall, shovel tests were limited due to high ground surface visibility (generally over 40
percent) along the course of Segment 3. Terraces overlooking shallow drainages had the highest
visibility, while lowlands were filled with thicker vegetation. At historic bullet scatter Site 41PT491,
very high visibility in conjunction with the surficial nature of the artifacts resulted in surface inspection
only. The site is associated with a U.S. Army rifle range 200 meters west of the alignment (Figure 9).
Soils within the southern and middle portions of the main alignment of Segment 3 consisted of medium

brown (5YR 4/2) to dark brown (5YR 3/4) sandy loam with calcium carbonate and depths between 30
and 50 centimeters. The northern portion of Segment 3 nearing the primary pumping station was
characterized by brown (7.5YR 4/4) soft sandy loam with orange and gray soil toward 60 centimeters.
Average depths of shovel tests in this area ranged between 55 and 66 centimeters and were terminated
due to compact caliche and clay.

Segment 4
Segment 4 consists of utility corridors leading from the primary pumping station at the end of Segment 3
to 21 proposed, four of the wells are constructed previously as prototypes, well sites (well sites along with
the pumping station compose Segment 5). The utility corridors follow two-track or graded roads (often
within the alignment rights-of-way) throughout Segment 4, lending accessibility for construction and
maintenance of the wells. The majority of vegetation consisted of short grasses and yucca, but, as in
Segment 3, taller grasses were common in lowlands. The utility corridors extend northwest and southeast
from the pumping station, branching into all directions further away from the main water line. The utility
corridors of Segment 4 lying west of the pumping station cross over rugged hills and terraces with the

northern portions looking over Coetas Creek (Figures 11 and 12) just northeast of the project area. The
lines expand northwest to cover a total of 9.75 kilometers of land with high amounts of erosion along with
vehicle disturbance out to and on previously constructed well sites. The utility corridors of Segment 4
extend east for 1.5 kilometers and from there continue another kilometer east to a well pad site, north to
cover 14 kilometers through a series of branches (extending into far western Carson County), and south to
cover 16 kilometers down SH 136 and west toward the main alignment. The majority of the land in this
portion of Segment 4 was characterized as an undulating surface with many terraces, then becoming less
rugged toward the southern portion of the south extension. Disturbance on the east side of Segment 4 was
mainly a result of relief erosion, vehicle tracks leading to well pads, and an old highway running along the
east side of existing SH 136. This road extended for several kilometers through the lowlands and terraces
alongside the highway and was cut down approximately 15 centimeters below ground surface.
Figure 11: View facing west of the rugged landscape of the Coetas Creek tributary near the north end of the
overall project area.

Four shovel tests were excavated on the western portion of utility corridors, all of which were negative.
Within the west utility corridors there were no sites found, but Isolated Find 2, a modified chert core, was
found on a hilltop near a well pad site, and Isolated Find 3, a chert flake or possible scraper, was found
just 50 meters south of Coetas Creek. Shovel tests were performed at each location to ensure no cultural
materials were buried. Ground visibility was variable depending on location; higher terrains had higher
visibility (70-90 percent) while lower terrains had lower but still sufficient visibility (10-50 percent). The
soils on the west utility corridors of Segment 4 consisted of dark brown (10YR 3/2) silty loam with
moderate amounts gravel and some tan to medium brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy soil and were excavated to a
typical depth of 50 cm. The chert core and flake/possible scraper were the only cultural materials on the
western side of Segment 4.

Seventeen shovel tests were excavated on the eastern portion of Segment 4, one of which (AM7) was
positive for cultural materials. Two sites were encountered, Sites 41TV490 and 41CZ81, prompting
seven and five shovel tests, respectively. The only positive shovel test of the eastern side was in Site
41TV490 (AM7), which contained two chert flakes. The site as a whole is a prehistoric surficial lithic
scatter of an unknown age. It contains late-stage lithics and one possible hammerstone and extends 75
meters north-south by 50 meters east-west at the southernmost tip of the east utility corridors. Site
41CZ81, located on a northeastern branch of the east utility corridors within Carson County, consists of
an unknown prehistoric surficial scatter of late-stage flakes. The distribution across the 35 by 35 meter
site is very sparse and sits on a high finger ridge terrace adjacent to a drainage area. Isolated Finds 1 and 4
were found along this portion of Segment 4 as well. Isolated Find 1, a small projectile point, was found
on the surface near the southernmost well pad site on the eastern side of the main water line, while
Isolated Find 2, a white glazed stoneware sherd, was found on the surface approximately 1.5 kilometers
east of the primary pumping station. Ground visibility over the eastern portion of the utility corridors was
high (usually at least 40 percent) and consisted mainly of dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) silty loam with
occasionally large amounts of medium to dark brown (5YR 4/3) clay or sand. Caliche was usually the
cause of shovel test termination at depths ranging from 15 to 100 centimeters.
This segment consists of above ground elements, however there are no standing structures in the vicinity
and therefore there is no potential to effect non-archeological historic-age resources.

Segment 5
Segment Five includes 21 one-acre proposed well pad sites and the five-acre primary pumping station
site. Each well site is located at the end of a collection line usually on level ground. Generally, well sites
located on the western side of the main alignment were on terraces or uplands above drainages, while
those on the eastern side ranged from hilltops on rolling plains to rugged terraces. The well sites already
constructed at the time of investigation (Figure 13) had a high level of disturbance due to construction,

leaving the area barren and deeply cracked. Erosion at proposed well pads surrounded by drainages was
the main source of disturbance along with very light vehicular traffic along two track and graded roads.
The primary pumping station (Figure 14) is situated on a slightly eastward sloping upland just north of a
graded road and west of a privately-owned caliche quarry. Erosion due to these factors was the main
cause of disturbance adjacent to the proposed pumping station area.

Results of Investigations

Twenty-one shovel tests were excavated at one-acre well sites. Visibility was usually high (most often
70+ percent but at least 30 percent) and soils were generally consistent with those of the utility corridors
leading to the well sites. Soils at well sites yet to be constructed ranged from dark brown (5YR 3/2) soft
silty loam to medium brown (10 YR 4/4) sandy soil with maximum depths of typically 40 centimeters.
At the well sites already built, soils were dry, sandy, and most likely a result of constrtuction activities
such as “slush pit” excavation.
Ten shovel tests were performed within the five acres of proposed pumping station land, all of which
were negative for cultural materials. Visibility in the area was very high (normally at least 50 percent).
Soils within the five acres were mainly light to medium brown loam or sandy loam with caliche toward
termination, which usually occurred at a depth of about 30-50 centimeters. Soils on the west side of the
pumping station, though, were drier than those to the east and contained small amounts of gravels. No
cultural resources were found at the primary pumping station.
Though this segment consists of above ground elements, there are no standing structures in the vicinity
and, therefore, there is no potential to effect non-archeological historic-age resources.

Segment 6
Segment 6 extends approximately 1.8 kilometers east-west from the westernmost collection line leading
off SH 136, connecting Segment 3 to the utility corridors of Segment 4. This segment passes
immediately north of or within a large, well-maintained main access gravel road. Disturbance was
generally very high. The alignment crosses the very southern headwaters of Berry Sand Draw a quarter
of a kilometer from the segment’s eastern terminus, overlooking the drainage as it extends toward the
north-northwest. This creek crossing is, according to project engineers, repeatedly washed out during
heavy rains and has been subject to repeated subsequent reconstruction. The majority of the eastern
portion of the segment crosses intermediary terraces overlooking drainages associated with Berry Sand
Draw, while the western half of the segment is rugged with rolling hills and upland plains (Figure 15).
Vegetation was limited to short grasses, cacti, yucca, and thick burrs throughout most of the segment.
Erosion is significant in a single area toward the eastern terminus due to construction on the north side of
the dirt road leading into the area off SH 136. The rest of the segment remains largely intact.
This segment consists of subsurface elements only and has no effect potential to non-archeological
historic-age resources.
Eleven shovel tests were excavated in the segment, four of which were positive for cultural remains.
Three of the positive shovel tests (SW101, SW103-104) were conducted within an isolated mid-20th
century burn pile located in the eastern portion of Segment 6, the other (SW110) within 41PT492, just
east of 41PT491. The burn pile consists of a historic trash collection including glass bottles, pulled wire,
nails, metal scraps, and bricks (see Historic Locality Discussion). Also within this segment,
archeologists recorded 41PT492, which consists of a large crater where a historic house once stood along
with associated debris (see Site Discussion). Throughout the area, surface visibility averaged at about 50
percent. Soils within the segment consisted of silty sandy loam of varying shades (7.5YR 4/3, 5/4, and
6/4) which typically terminated at an average of 50 centimeters. One trench was excavated in Segment 6
near the eastern terminus of the alignment just off the dirt road.
This segment consists of subsurface elements only and has no effect potential to non-archeological
historic-age resources.

Backhoe Trenching
During the course of field investigations, archeologists encountered two depositional terraces of Berry
Sand Draw that bore indications of being larger and deeper than initially anticipated and could have
contained significant cultural materials. Archeologists revisited these locales and utilized mechanical
trenching to investigate the potential for deeply-buried archeological deposits, excavating three backhoe
trenches in the process.
Backhoe Trenches 1 and 2 were excavated on the lower and upper (respectively) terraces overlooking a
prominent crossing of Berry Sand Draw to the north (along Segment 3; Figures 8 and 16). From field
survey, it was clear to researchers that, within the proposed transmission pipeline line corridor, the
Draw’s steep northern terrace forms the creek’s erosional side while the gradual, rolling southern terraces
were depositional. Backhoe Trench 1, excavated on the first terrace, was excavated to a maximum depth
of 282 centimeters. Soils within the trench consisted of 10YR5/4 tan, uniform, soft sand from 0-23
centimeters followed by 114 centimeters of 7.5YR4/3 brown dense sand. Soils transitioned to a gravelly,
wet, coarse sand at a depth of 137 centimeters and extended (with increasing gravels and moisture
content) to its terminus. This lower gravelly, base may constitute an earlier channel of the Draw. The
trench did not contain any artifacts or features, or any other evidence of human occupation.
Backhoe Trench 2, excavated on the Draw’s secondary terrace was also negative for cultural materials
(Figure 17 and 18). This trench contained a generally similar soil profile with soft, uniform sand
extending from the surface to 155 centimeters, followed by gradually coarser subsoil that extended to 235
centimeters. Beneath this subsoil, the trench extended to 271 centimeters through gravelly, cobbly sand
that was clearly pre-cultural.
Along Segment 6, archeologists excavated a single backhoe trench within a severely disturbed floodplain
of Berry Sand Draw, near its headwaters. According to representatives of the City of Amarillo, this creek
channel floods repeatedly during heavy rains and the subsequent flooding washes out the channel. At the
time of survey, this channel was found to be heavily modified with evidence of recent mechanical grading

and push piles throughout (Figure 19). Backhoe Trench 3 was placed in what was thought to be the least
disturbed portion of the corridor. Archeologists immediately noted abundant indications that disturbance
extended well below the surface with heavily mottled cobbly clay in the upper 130 centimeters followed
by 60 centimeters of pale green and yellow, mottled gravelly clay that frequently slumped into the trench
when dug, a strong indication of introduced fill and modern modification (Figures 20 and 21). Due to the
extent of slumping and the clear abundance of indications of modern disturbance, the trench was
terminated at 191 centimeters. This trench was negative for cultural materials, features, or other evidence
of historic age or prehistoric cultural activity.

Site Descriptions

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
41PT490
Site 41PT490 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of unknown age encountered within a segment of proposed
utility corridors (Segment 4) east of SH 136, near the eastern edge of Potter County (see Appendix A).
Situated along a cleared and graded ranch road immediately east of a property fence line, the site is
primarily composed of surficial, late-stage lithic flakes and one possible hammerstone (Figure 22). The
site is found on a low upland terrace overlooking a very small intermittent tributary to Berry Sand Draw
flowing approximately 100 meters to the north (Figure 23). The surficial scatter measures approximately
75 meters north-south by 50 meters east–west (3,750 square meters). Seven shovel tests excavated within
the site boundaries revealed artifacts extended to a maximum depth of 10 centimeters below the ground
surface. Surface visibility in the site is very good, typically greater than 60 percent (nearly 100% within
the graded ranch road). The ranch road, graded to approximately 15 centimeters below the natural ground
surface, constitutes the primary modern disturbance for the site. At the southern end of the site, a short
caliche drive leads through a gate and onto the highway, outside of the proposed easement
While occasional flakes were regularly found on the ground surface within the site boundaries,
archeologists recorded three separate, distinct lithic scatters that were more dense. Within the site
boundaries the artifacts vary in surface density, with the highest concentrations within the graded ranch
road near the site’s center and quickly tapering off to the east and west (particularly to the west, where the
highway right-of-way has been graded for drainage ditches and no elements of the site were visible).
Each scatter contained primarily tertiary-stage alibates chert flakes scattered at a density of approximately
two to four flakes per three-square-meter area (Figure 24). Microliths were also encountered in an ant
mound located within the site boundaries, but, from shovel test data (see below) those micro-flakes were
likely from the upper 10 centimeters of sediment. A quartzite hammerstone was also recorded near the
site’s northern-most lithic scatter. This hammerstone fit well in the hand and contained clear pocking at
its apparent distal end. Aside from the scatters themselves, no other features were observed within any
portion of the site, nor were any diagnostics or evidence of organic preservation noted.
Seven shovel tests (Table 1), placed at approximately 20-meter intervals in areas of surface artifacts
within the proposed utility corridor, were generally negative for subsurface artifacts, though Shovel Test
AM7, excavated near the site’s northern terminus, contained two flakes in the upper 10 centimeters of
sediments. As can be seen in Table 1, the soils within the site were typical of the project area with 30 to
60 centimeters of 7.5YR3/2 to 5/3, soft brown silty loams reaching a dense red clay B horizon.
Lacking significant features and the prevalence of late-stage lithic debitage, archeologists conclude that
this site was likely a temporary campsite that was only briefly occupied. The concentration of flakes
along the property’s fence line could be an indication that portions of the site once extended into the
existing highway right-of-way; however, those elements have likely been destroyed by construction and
drainage grading. Furthermore those areas were outside of the current survey corridor and were not
intensively inspected. Lacking any diagnostics or evidence of organic preservation, it is impossible to
assign Site 41PT490 to a specific period, furthermore, lacking subsurface deposition, it is also impossible
to assess how much of the site is intact and preserved (if any). Given the density of artifacts within the
graded ranch road, it is likely that very little of the site remains intact. Overall, it is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that Site 41PT490 is a minor lithic scatter that lacks any of the criteria that would
make it eligible for listing as a SAL or in the NRHP. Furthermore the site should not require any
additional investigation with no further coordination prior to construction and the project should be
allowed to proceed in the vicinity of this site.

Site 41CZ81
Site 41PT490 is a very small, prehistoric lithic scatter of unknown age encountered within a segment of
proposed utility corridors near the western edge of Carson County (see Appendix A). Situated on a high
finger ridge terrace immediately north of a property fence line, the site is composed of sparse, surficial,
late-stage lithic flakes and one possible metate fragment (Figure 25). The site has a commanding view of
the surrounding countryside and overlooks a prominent tributary of Coetas Creek to the east and a minor
tributary to the west. To the north, the finger terrace descends gradually to its base at an artificial tank.
The site is delineated by the extent of surficial lithics and limitations of the landform, measuring
approximately 35 x 35 meters (1,225 square meters). Five shovel tests excavated during site
investigations revealed artifacts were limited to the ground surface. Vegetation observed within the site
area is typical of this portion of the project corridor with clumps of short ranch grasses and occasional
mesquite saplings and yucca (Figure 26). Surface visibility in the site is very good, typically greater than
60 percent with very little indication of modern disturbance beyond fence placement and slight erosion
and isolated pockets of bioturbation (cattle trails and hoof gouges).
Within site boundaries, archeologists noted four very small clusters of one to five brightly colored flakes
of alibates chert, each within a five-square-meter area (Figures 27 and 28). Like Site 41PT490, the flakes
observed within Site 41CZ81 were primarily late-stage debitage that lacked any indication of use wear.
No formal tools were noted, though a single, flat sandstone cobble fragment found on the ground surface
was possibly the remnant of a metate. Additionally, beyond the small scatters themselves, no other
features were found within the site boundaries nor were there any indications of organic preservation.
Five shovel tests excavated during site investigations were negative for cultural materials (Table 2).
Tests revealed a consistent soil composition within the site of 10-30 centimeters of tan loams overlying
dense, orange clay loams and caliche.
Lacking any diagnostic artifacts, features, or organic preservation, Site 41CZ81 is most likely a minor,
surficial temporary camp site used for a very brief period of time. The site lacks any of the components
that would make it eligible for listing as a SAL and does not warrant any additional investigation beyond
that conducted during the course of this survey.

Sites 41PT491 and 41PT492
Near the intersection of Segments 3 and 6, archeologists noted two interrelated archeological sites
(41PT491 and 41PT492) that are likely attributed to a brief, but historic, occupation in the region during
the middle of the 20th century (see Appendix A). Site 41PT491 is an unusual, large, historic bullet scatter
found along the central portion of the main transmission pipeline approximately three miles southwest of
the proposed pumping station. The site consists solely of a large scatter of apparently fired bullets that
have likely overtopped a historic U.S. Army rifle range located approximately 200 meters to its west. No
other artifacts were observed within the site boundary of any kind. Due to excellent surface visibility and
a clear lack of other types of artifacts (historic or prehistoric), this site was inspected and recorded solely
based upon surface inspection.
Within the survey corridor, the surficial scatter measures approximately 50 meters north-south by 30
meters east-west (1,500 square meters) though the scatter likely extends well beyond the area subject to
field survey. Within this site boundary, archeologists noted an abundant scatter of corroded, fired bullets
littering the ground surface (Figure 29). While it was impossible to count each one, the Principal
Investigator estimates bullet totals within site boundaries at approximately 50-70 with some clusters of
five to eight bullets per square meter. The bullets were heavily corroded and generally lacked
deformations that would be expected from high-speed impact, however, lacking any casing, it was
obvious that they had been fired. Each bullet appeared to be the same caliber (.45 caliber: 0.4375 inches
in diameter x 0.625 inches in length) with a corroded lead core and a metal jacket (Figures 30 and 31).
The bullets, from their dimension, appear to be .45 caliber ACP solid point types that were developed in
the early 1900s and eventually were U.S. Army issue for use with their Colt M1911A1 semi-automatic
pistol (Wikipedia 2009a and b; Figures 32 and 33). In use to this day, the ACP round is known for its
accuracy and effectiveness against human targets. It is also particularly well-known for its low firing
pressure and relatively slow speed. This low speed could be a reason that so few of the bullets were
deformed from impact on the ground surface.
As mentioned above, the scatter was found down-range of a “U.S. Army Rifle Range” depicted on the
Berry Sand Draw USGS Topographic map. The range’s firing berm was located well outside of the
current study corridor and was only cursorily inspected from the project easement (Figure 34).
Measuring approximately 100 yards (91 m) in length and standing some 10-12 feet (3-4 m) high, the
berm was substantial on the otherwise gently-rolling landform. Though no other standing structures were
observed in any other area in the vicinity of the firing range, one 16 x 5-foot (4.8 x 1.5 m) rectangular
concrete foundation was noted near the gravel access road that leads to the range (Figure 35). Wooden
planks and lumber were scattered over the foundation’s surface. It is unclear what type of structure may
have stood at this location as it was nonetheless somewhat downrange of the berm.

Site Descriptions

According to Eric Rodriquez (personal communication 2009), an employee of the City of Amarillo who
spoke directly with the property’s current landowner, Beaumont Boyce, this range was called the Ritter
Rifle Range. It was built by the U.S. Army in 1944 as part of a larger bivouac for training troops and was
used until 1946. This period of operation corresponds to a period of intensive use of the Amarillo Army
Air Field (part of the current International Airport approximately 15 miles to the south) for mechanics,
flight, and basic training during the war (Krenzolak 2009). This range may have served as one of the
training facilities associated with the air field installation. Given the singular nature of the bullets
observed in the area, the level of corrosion, and Mr. Rodriquez’ identification of the property, it is very
likely that these bullets were fired by U.S. Army personnel during training for World War II. Given the
number of bullets found within the site, it must have been fairly early in their training as so many shots
clearly missed their mark and overshot a very large and prominent berm.
Located approximately 300 meters to 41PT491’s southeast and immediately north of the prominent gravel
access road that marks Segment 6 is Site 41PT492 (Appendix A, Figure 36). Measuring approximately
80 meters east-west by 60 meters north-south, this site consists of a 10-meter diameter depression in the
otherwise flat grassy upland with isolated planks of lumber and a single wooden post lying on the ground
or standing upright nearby (respectively Figures 37 and 38). To the depression’s north is a long, linear
arrangement of short, vertical galvanized steel 2.5-inch pipes spaced approximately 12 feet apart along
with a light scatter of lumber (Figure 39). At the site’s western terminus, archeologists noted a single
fired .45 caliber bullet along with a corroded, spent matching bullet casing, and a large, heavy iron plate.
At its eastern terminus, archeologists noted a prominent earthen push-pile and two conspicuously large
and prominent trees that were most likely artificially planted at this location. A very diffuse scatter (1
artifact per 10 square meters) of historic artifacts (primarily various dimensions of lumber, but occasional
pieces of scrap metal and glass) was noted throughout the site boundaries. This scatter was the primary
means of site boundary delineation.
Five shovel tests were excavated during investigations of Site 41PT492 (MM102, SW108-111) in
portions of the site closest to the water line corridor (Table 3). Only one (SW110) of these tests was
positive for cultural materials: two 3-inch-long pulled wire nails and one one-inch-long pulled wire nail
(Figure 40). Excavated in the center of the prominent depression that marks the site’s main feature,
Shovel Test SW110 contacted subsurface fallen lumber at a depth of approximately 15 centimeters
followed by sterile gravelly sand at 30 centimeters. Soils throughout the site consisted of 10 to 20
centimeters of dark brown (10YR4/3) sandy loam followed by 20 to 40 centimeters of pale gravelly sand
and caliche. Beyond the features described above and the nominal compliment of historic artifacts, no
other cultural manifestations were encountered within the site boundaries.
According to Mr. Rodriquez, Site 41PT492 corresponds to the current landowner’s father’s family home.
Mr. Boyce’s (the current landowner) father lived in the home for some time prior to 1944 and vacated the
structure during the U.S. Army’s occupation and use of the Ritter Rifle Range. The home is assumed to
have been vacant while the Army conducted its training because, according to the landowner, the trainees
eventually (and without the permission of the landowner) began firing on the structure and using it for
target practice. Presumably over repeated training sessions and numerous spent rounds the home was so
damaged that the elder Mr. Boyce demanded the Army purchase the home and repay him for the
damages. The Army obliged and when they ceased training in the area, left the landowner with the
structure. Though still standing, the house was no longer livable and was used for hay storage for some
time. The landowner eventually demolished it, leaving the prominent depression that now marks the
primary site feature.

Figure 40: Artifacts encountered within Site 41PT492.

Knowing that this site represents a former home, archeologists noted a distinct lack of associated
outbuildings, walkways or other, related features common with historic domestic structures and also
noted a relatively scant artifact assemblage. This could indicate that the house was only intended for
temporary use, or it was a very small home overall. The long line of vertical iron pipe and associated
wood planks could be the remnants of a fence, or, more exotically, it could be some Army training
equipment, as the landowner told the surveyors that other impromptu World War II training apparatus are
found throughout his property (none of which were encountered during this survey). Finally, the spent
.45 bullet and the large, heavy metal plate could indicate that this was another portion of the firing range
with the plate representing a possible target. Attempts were made to confirm some of these hypotheses by
locating photographs of the area (particularly aerials of the mid-1940s to 1950s) but none were readily
available.
According to the 1930 U.S. Census, there were four Boyce families living in Potter County: the John K.
Boyce family (wife – Margaret C., daughter Margaret C., son – John K.), the Mrs. Tannihill Boyce family
(son – William G., daughter – Elizabeth, son – Albert G., daughter – Anne L., daughter – Mary L.), the
William C. Boyce family (wife – Julia E., daughter – Barbara), and a Mrs. William C. Boyce. Three of
the family heads list Tennessee as their birthplace indicating that they were likely siblings who moved as
a family to the area (Census 1930). None of the families list Beaumont as a child and none of the family
addresses appear to match the property on which 41PT492 is located so it is unclear which family can be
attributed to the site. None of the family names is listed in the Handbook of Texas and, given the setting,
it is unlikely that the site can be associated with an individual of local or national significance.
While 41PT491 and 41PT492’s likely association with such a storied period of American history is
noteworthy, the sites in and of themselves lack any associated features or other artifact types within the
survey corridor. The information gathered through this survey and the brief subsequent oral historical
investigation have sufficiently gleaned as much data from the site as is warranted. It is highly unlikely
that other, more significant features associated with the Ritter Rifle Range would be found within the
project corridor as any features would invariably have to have been placed downrange of the firing range,
a categorically inhospitable location. Any features of interpretive substance (bivouac/tent locations,
buildings, trash deposits, etc.) were, according to the landowner placed on the other side of the firing
berm south of the access road, in much safer environs. While the firing berm and associated concrete

Site Descriptions

foundation that were noted are part of a larger historic site in and of themselves that do warrant additional
investigation, these features were too far beyond the current study corridor to investigate fully and will
not be affected by the proposed construction. Sites 41PT491 and 492 are therefore not considered eligible
for listing as a SAL and do not warrant additional investigations prior to construction.

Historic Locality
Located near Segment 6’s eastern terminus, archeologists noted a small, primarily surficial, cluster of
historic debris and ash immediately north of the proposed transmission line (Appendix A). Measuring
approximately 400 square meters (20 x 20 m), the scatter is situated on the high, secondary terrace
overlooking the Berry Sand Draw headwaters farther to the west (see Figure 41). Within the scatter,
archeologists noted various pieces of clear, green, and brown bottle glass, scrap metal (mostly bucket
fragments), pulled wire nails, ceramic tile, and two red-paste bricks. Near the scatter’s center,
archeologists noted a distinct ashy zone measuring approximately 10 meters in diameter. With the clear
abundance of ash in this area, it is likely that this locality is a trash burn pile. Among the bottle glass,
archeologists noted three separate likely 1940s to 1950s temporal diagnostics. Archeologists recorded a
small, cylindrical sauce jar with the common Owens-Illinois Bottling Company maker’s mark (elongated
diamond with circle in center) on the base that has been assigned a likely production date of 1942 or 1952
(Lockhart 2004). Also, one Royal Crown bottle carried the cursive “Duraglas” insignia (also attributed to
the Owens-Illinois Bottling Company) on its base that was used from 1940 until the mid-1950s (BLM and
SHA 2009). Finally, fragments of two hobbleskirt Coca Cola bottles (bottled in Amarillo) were noted
amongst the scatter. Lacking the tell-tale blue tint that is attributed to bottles of the World War II era,
these examples either pre-date 1942 or post-date 1946 (more likely the latter; Lynch 2009).
Five shovel tests were excavated within the scatter with three being positive for shallowly-buried
complementary historic-period artifacts including pulled wire nails, melted glass, and additional scrap
metal. Shovel Test SW103, dug in the center of the ashy zone, contained a relatively large amount of
burned wood fragments as well as nails and glass. None of the buried artifacts were found below a depth
of 10 centimeters while the ground surface in the area was fairly dense with historic artifacts
(approximately 8 artifacts per square meter). Beyond the ashy burn pile area, no other features were
noted. Lacking any associated structural features or more significant clusters of artifacts, archeologists
did not consider the materials to warrant formal designation as an archeological site and instead
documented it as a minor historic locality. From the variety of artifacts found, as well as the redundant
temporal diagnostics from the bottle glass maker’s mark, this locality is most likely a historic period trash
burn pile that is dated to the late 1940s or early 1950s. No further investigations are warranted for this
resource.

Isolated Finds
Through the course of the field investigations, archeologists encountered several other pieces of historic
and prehistoric material culture that were located beyond the recorded archeological sites discussed
above. These finds were all found as individual items in isolation of other artifacts and/or features. Each
find is considered to lack cultural significance and lacks overall potential for listing in the NRHP or as a
SAL. Below is a brief discussion of each of these finds.

Isolated Find 1
Archeologists, while surveying one of the southern-most utility corridor west of SH 136, turned south to
investigate a proposed well location, but errantly did so too far to the west. Investigators, while reaching
the incorrect well pad location, observed an arrow point fragment on the ground surface (Figure 42). The
arrow was located on a low terrace overlooking tributaries of Berry Sand Draw to the north and south
(Appendix A). The point, measures approximately 1.3 centimeters wide and 1 centimeter long and is
composed of pink, red, and white alibates chert. The point’s base and distal tip were missing, so
conclusive identification was not possible; however, it has been tentatively identified as a Scallorn
fragment. Scallorn points, common throughout most of Texas, are attributed to the Ceramic period (A.D.
700-1200) in this region of Texas. Slight dentition was observed along one edge that could be evidence
of retouching. No other artifacts were observed in the vicinity on the ground surface nor were any
encountered within Shovel Tests SW11 and AB9, which were excavated in the vicinity. As mentioned
above, surveyors errantly observed the point fragment in an area that is not slated for water utility corridor
construction. Subsequent survey in the actual construction alignment was negative for any related
artifacts or features. The find was considered isolated, photographed, and returned.

Isolated Find 2
On a low bluff in the intermediary waist between two hilltops, near the project’s northwestern terminus,
archeologists observed a single white and pink alibates chert tertiary flake lying on the ground surface
among a scatter of natural cobbles and gravels (Appendix A; Figure 43). The flake was found
immediately north of a gravel road that marks the utility corridor’s proposed alignment. The flake,
measuring approximately four centimeters long by 2.5 centimeters wide had a slightly unifacial profile,
but, citing the abundance of chips and alterations to the artifact that are likely artificial (bioturbation or
mechanical road stripping), this is likely a modern modification. Two shovel tests excavated in the
vicinity (MM1 and AM13) were negative for complementing cultural resources and no further artifacts
were observed on the ground surface nearby. This flake was considered an isolated find, briefly
documented and photographed, and returned to its find location.

Site Descriptions

Isolated Find 3
Isolated Find 3 is located at the northern-most proposed well site along the northwestern utility corridor
(Appendix A). At this well site, archeologists observed a single, unifacially-reduced, banded pink
alibates chert flake with abundant evidence of use-wear and retouch along one edge. The flake was
sitting on the ground surface of a large, open terrace overlooking Coetas Creek to the north. The flake,
measuring approximately 5.5 centimeters in length and 2.5 centimeters in width, fit comfortably between
the thumb and forefinger. The artifact bore numerous pocks and potlids, indicating that it likely had been
burned at some point, however all of these marks were on the convex face only (see Figure 44). This
may be a manifestation of the region’s inhabitants’ preference for heat-treating chert prior to reduction
(see Cultural Background Discussion) or an indication that the artifact is a re-used item that, between
functional periods, was burned. Ground surface visibility at the find location was excellent (>70%) and
archeologists conducted extensive surface inspection to find additional artifacts or possible features on
such a promising landform. Additionally, Shovel Test AB13, excavated in the vicinity, was negative for
subsurface artifacts. No other flakes, tools, or other artifacts were observed within the well pad site;
however, three additional flakes were encountered outside of the well site, eroding down the hill slope to
the west. This flake may have once been part of a larger site that has since eroded and is no longer extant.
The artifact was considered an isolated find, briefly documented, and returned to its find location.

Isolated Find 4
Located in an open field east of SH 136, Isolated Find 4 consisted of a single sherd of plain whiteware.
The sherd measures approximately 3 centimeters long and 2.5 centimeters wide (Appendix A; Figure
45). This item was slightly concave, indicating it might have been a segment of a plate or bowl, while the
exterior face bore some slight decorative relief. This find was made in the middle of an open field with
no other artifacts or features observed anywhere near the find location. Shovel Test MM6, excavated
nearby, was negative for any subsurface artifacts through shallow upland soils. It is unclear what this
item may have come from originally or how it got to this location, but it was considered an isolated find,
photographed, and returned.

Abandoned Segment of State Highway 136
Approximately 1,200 meters south of the intersection of SH 136 and Ranch Road 1342 (Appendix A),
surveyors noted the apparent remnants of an abandoned asphalt roadway immediately east of the existing
SH 136. Crossing the proposed project utility corridor only briefly, the abandoned road was composed of
a graded, flat roadbed, scattered chunks of asphalt, and what appeared to be a right-of-way monument
well outside of the existing highway right-of-way (Figures 46 and 47). The abandoned roadway diverged
from the existing road and extended toward the northeast, outside of the study corridor. This abandoned
roadway is clearly visible in aerial photos as a gently-curving corridor that extends to the north then
gradually merges with the existing roadway again. The 1955 Berry Sand Draw USGS 7.5’ quadrangle
depicts the abandoned roadway as that of SH 136 (Appendix A) with no straightened segment visible on
the modern aerial. Clearly the roadway observed within the study corridor is that of the original SH 136

route that, at some point after 1955, was abandoned and straightened, while the original roadway segment
was returned to the landowner and the asphalt was broken up and removed. This find is not considered to
be of particular significance and does not warrant any additional investigation or avoidance during
construction.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Under TAC Permit #5364, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted a 100% intensive linear and
areal archeological survey of the City of Amarillo’s proposed Potter County Well Field project in eastern
Potter and extreme western Carson Counties, Texas. The archeologists conducted linear archeological
survey along approximately 35 linear miles of proposed utility corridors and water transmission lines, 21
water well pads (each measuring one acre), and a five-acre pumping station. Surface inspection was
supplemented with shovel tests in locales with low surface visibility with the potential for containing
subsurface archeological deposits. The southern third of the project corridor was found to be primarily
flat, open cattle-grazing pastures and agricultural fields with minimal evidence of extensive modern
disturbance. A moderate length of the proposed pipeline corridor in this segment follows a historic
railroad bed that is now overgrown and severely disturbed, while another traverses disturbed contexts as it
parallels the existing highway ROW. The central third of the project corridor was low and gently-rolling
with one distinct creek crossing (Big Sandy Draw). Finally, the northern third of the project traversed the
spines of deeply-cut upland ridges overlooking Coetas Creek with excellent surface visibility and minimal
subsurface deposition. The overwhelming majority of the utility corridors that spread through this
northern-most third are being placed within contexts that have been severely impacted by two-track and
graded ranch roads.
Heavy rains prior to the field investigation resulted in a large number of inundated fields with extensive
standing water. Additionally, the heavy rains resulted in lusher than usual ground surface vegetation;
however, surface visibility was still considered good through much of the study corridor. Ninety-two
shovel tests were excavated (particularly along the southern third of the project corridor where surface
visibility was the lowest) with five being positive for subsurface archeological resources. Additionally,
three negative backhoe trenches were excavated on various terraces of Berry Sand Draw that intersect the
project alignment. Archeologists documented four archeological sites during the course of the survey
including two minor surficial lithic scatters (41PT490 and 41CZ81) one historic, likely World War II-era,
surficial bullet scatter (49PT491), and an associated house remnant (41PT492). None of the sites meet
the criteria to make them eligible for listing in the NRHP or as SALs. One burn pile of historic (mid-20th
century) trash was briefly recorded as a historic locality. In addition to the three previously-unrecorded
sites, archeologists encountered four isolated finds, including one likely Scallorn arrow point dating to the
Ceramic period, two pieces of lithic debitage, and a relief-decorated whiteware sherd. Finally,
archeologists briefly documented the remains of a curved segment of the original SH 136 that was
abandoned and removed once the roadway was straightened some time after 1955.
The Principal Investigator further recommends that construction along all portions of the proposed project
has minimal potential for impacting significant archeological and historical resources and should be
allowed to proceed with no further regulatory coordination under the Antiquities Code of Texas and the
National Historic Preservation Act needed with no historic properties affected. In the unlikely event that
during construction, such resources are encountered, Hicks & Company recommends that all work in the
area cease until such time as representatives of the THC are contacted and a professional archeologist can
assess the deposits for potential NRHP/SAL eligibility.
The effects of this project on historic structures has not been coordinated with the THC because initially
there were section 106 triggers for this project. Because the project may require a USACE Nationwide
Permit, the projects effects on historic structures must be considered per Section 106. Segments 1-3 and 6
consist solely of subsurface elements and would have no effect on standing structures. Segments 4 and 5
consist of above-ground elements but are located in open ranch land that has, in most locations, already
been impacted by numerous overhead utility lines and there are no standing structures in the vicinity.

Conclusions and Recommendations

Therefore it is recommended that the project would have no potential to effect non-archeological historicage resources, and an architectural survey is not recommended.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit #5364. All project-related forms, notes, and
photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.
