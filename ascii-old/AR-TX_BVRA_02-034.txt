ABSTRACT
A preliminary environmental and archaeological assessment of the 9.07 acre site
of the proposed Woodway Park addition in Brazos County, Texas was conducted by
archaeologist William E. Moore of Brazos Valley Research Associates and geologist
David S. Pettus of Southwest Geoservices in September of 1994. This study did not
locate any evidence of hazardous waste material or other items of environmental
concern, nor were any prehistoric or historic sites found to be present. The park site is
considered by the archaeologist to be a low probability area for prehistoric sites.
Historic utilization of the park site has been primarily agricultural and/or ranching.

INTRODUCTION
The City of College Station, Texas plans to acquire ownership of a 9.07 acre tract
of unimproved land in the southwestern sector of the City of College Station to be used
as a neighborhood park. Acquisition of the 9.07 acres will increase the size of the area
to be developed as Woodway Park. Currently, this property, which is situated in the
Crawford Burnett Tract (Abstract 7) of 71 acres, is owned by Mohawk Ltd, c/o Edsel G.
Jones, 310 University Drive East, College Station, Texas 77840. The purpose of this
investigation was to obtain an opinion from a professional archaeologist and geologist
regarding the potential for the presence of hazardous waste materials and/or significant
cultural resources (prehistoric or historic sites) within the proposed park site.
The project area is located in an area that is partially wooded and divided by a
small intermittent stream that is a tributary of Bee Creek. The tract is bordered on the
east by the old I & GN Railroad right-of-way (ROW) and on the west by the Jones-Butler
Road ROW. To the north is a 3.92 acre tract already owned by the City of College
Station (adjacent to Holleman Drive) and to the north the project area is bounded by the
remainder of a 47.27 tract owned by Mohawk, Ltd. The topography of the project area
is basically level and its elevation is 280-290 feet above mean sea level. According to
the National Flood Insurance Program's Flood Insurance Rate Map number 48041-C0182-C dated July 2, 1992, a portion of this tract could be within the 500-year
designated flood hazard boundary. The project area site plan and boundary survey is
depicted in Figure 1, and its location on the 7.5' USGS topographic quadrangle
Wellborn, Texas is depicted as Figure 2.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Prior to entering the field, the Geologist visited the Brazos County Courthouse
and examined tax records at the County Tax Assessors Office and conducted
interviews with the staff of the Brazos County Appraisal District. The archeologist
checked site records for the area and reviewed recent contract reports for Brazos
County.
Maps examined include two aerial photographs believed to date to the 1970s, the
7.5' USGS topographic map Wellborn dated 1961 (photorevised 1980), and various land
ownership maps and plats provided by the City of College Station. The Brazos County
soil survey (Mowery et al. 1958) and supplement (Chervenka 1978) were also
consulted. In addition, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin,
Texas was contacted regarding the presence of previously recorded sites within the
project area.
The entire 9.7 acre tract was examined by the two investigators. The Geologist
looked for evidence of past or present activities that would result in the disposal of
industrial waste within the project area and vicinity. Signs of these activities could be
abandoned oil field equipment, barrels and other kinds of containers used to store
chemicals, discoloration on the vegetation and water, and, of course, the presence of
waste materials.
The archaeologist looked for evidence of cultural resources, prehistoric and/or
historic sites within the project area. Signs of these kinds of sites might include
prehistoric or historic artifacts on the surface or buried beneath the ground surface and
surface indications of historic activity such as standing structures and/or other
indications of farming/ranching such as fences, water troughs, and pens.
Poor ground visibility necessitated shovel testing by the archaeologist. Very few
areas of exposed ground surface were present and these were examined closely for
cultural materials. Shovel tests were excavated on both banks of the tributary and
shovel probes were dug randomly throughout the project area. In this report a shovel
test is defined a hole from which all excavated matrix is screened through 1/4 inch
hardware cloth, while a probe is simply a hole dug with a shovel from which the
excavated matrix is not screened. Typically, probes are efforts to test the soil in areas
where testing is not considered necessary. Sometimes a planned test is aborted when
clay is discovered at the surface. In these instances, the tests become probes. This
was the case for all of the probes dug for this project. In all, 14 shovel tests and 4
shovel probes were dug. The dirt from each test was returned, or backfilled, to the hole
once it was completed. Shovel tests were dug to clay. Data obtained from shovel
testing were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120).
According to Fenneman, this physiographic section is subdivided according to the age
of the geological formations (Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The
area is hilly and situated within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as
an area characterized by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are
acid sandy loams or sands.
The climate is subhumid to humid and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees and a July maximum temperature of 95 degrees
combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180). The
altitude varies from 200-400 feet. The project area is located on a tract of land that is
bisected by an intermittent tributary of Bee Creek. Elevations within the project area
vary from 280-290 feet.
The entire project area is located within the Lufkin fine sandy loam (Ld), 1-3
percent slopes as defined in the 1958 soil survey for Brazos County (Mowery et al.
1958:44, Sheet 35). The Lufkin series consists of grayish-forested Planosols developed
in alkaline clay and sandy clay. Runoff ranges from very slow to moderately rapid with
the rate depending on the surface gradient. Internal drainage is very slow. Only about
5% of these soils were in cultivation in 1950 with about 60% abandoned field/pasture.
The rest was in native woodland pasture. Currently, the soil survey is being updated;
this information was not readily available at the time of this investigation.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A check of the records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
in Austin, Texas revealed no archeological sites have been recorded in the project area.
According to the files at TARL, numbers have been assigned or reserved for 123 sites
in Brazos County (No site forms have been filed for sites 41BZ106 - 41BZ108).
Fifty-four sites, or 43 percent of this total, were recorded as a result of the Millican
Reservoir Project to the southeast of the present study area.
Data for the discussion which follows were taken from the TARL site files, the
THC library, various bibliographies (Moore 1988, 1989b; Patterson 1986; Simons 1981),
a data base by Leland W. Patterson (1989), and published volumes of an ongoing
project abstracting Texas contract reports (Moore 1990, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1993a).
The previous works discussed below consist of major projects in Brazos County and
vicinity and those smaller area surveys that resulted in recording new sites or assessed
sites previously recorded. The remaining studies that did not record sites can be found
in those works cited above.
Sites are often recorded as a result of collectors sharing their information with
archaeologists or state agencies.
The first sites recorded in Brazos County
(41BZ1-41BZ7) document private collections and were recorded in the 1960s and
1970s.
Other sites recorded by individuals include 41BZ31-41BZ35; 41BZ38;
41BZ73-41BZ74; 41BZ76; 41BZ83-41BZ84; 41BZ90-41BZ91; 41BZ93-41BZ102. This
information was taken from the TARL site files.
Much of the data regarding sites in Brazos County are from surface collections.
At prehistoric sites this often occurs as surface scatters containing debitage with few, if
any, diagnostic artifacts. Therefore, very little is known concerning the cultural affiliation
of many sites in the county.
Although, in general, this area has not been the locus of major projects by
professional archaeologists, several studies in the vicinity have provided valuable
comparative data. Excellent summaries of the prehistory of this part of Texas have
been compiled by Kotter (1981) Roemer and Carlson (1987), Prewitt (1981), and Thoms
(1993).
Prehistoric Investigations in Brazos County
The first systematic investigation in Brazos County occurred when portions of the
Navasota River Basin were surveyed within the authorized damsite for the Millican
Reservoir in 1971 by R. T. Ray and Alton Briggs for the Texas Historical Commission
and Texas Water Development Board. According to Kotter (1981:391- 392), this initial
survey recorded nine archeological sites (41BZ8-41BZ16).
One site (41BZ15)
contained an historic component as well as prehistoric materials. The results of this
project remain unpublished.

6

A second archeological survey of the Navasota River Basin was conducted by
the Texas Archeological Survey (Sorrow and Cox 1973) for the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District. This work was carried out in anticipation of the
proposed Millican Lake on the Navasota River that would inundate portions of Brazos,
Grimes, and Madison counties. Flooding caused by frequent rains during the project
made it impossible for much of the bottomlands to be examined. The amount of land
surveyed is not mentioned in the report. Shovel testing was not conducted. In Brazos
County, fourteen prehistoric sites (41BZ17- 41BZ30) were recorded. Nine sites
(41BZ8-41BZ16), previously recorded by the Texas Historical Commission in 1971,
were revisited.
The majority of the prehistoric sites found by Sorrow and Cox were thinly
distributed lithic scatters exposed in rodent spoil piles. Approximately half of all sites
examined contained only lithic debitage, and only three sites contained evidence of
subsistence in the form of mussel shell or grinding stones. According to Kotter
(1981:34-35), this survey was useful in that it demonstrated that large numbers of sites
exist in an area previously thought to contain few cultural resources.
It was concluded that the number of sites recorded represents only a fraction of
the total present in the basin. The age of sites in the basin is believed to range from
Paleoindian to Historic. It was recommended that a more comprehensive study of the
area, including subsurface testing, be carried out prior to construction of the dam.
A review of prehistoric and historic resources in the Millican Project was
conducted by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kotter and Victor 1981) prior to an
assessment of the cultural resources of the Millican Project (Navasota River Basin) by
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kotter 1981).
This survey recorded 32 sites
(41BZ39-41BZ70; 41BZ75 [out of the project area]) and two localities. Site 41BZ46 is
historic and 41BZ66 contains prehistoric and historic components.
The Millican project represents the most intensive study of cultural resources in
Brazos County. Data collected indicate that significant cultural resources are present
within all portions of the project area. Although some of the sites may be eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places, not one was nominated. The possibility of the area
as a district was discussed.
The Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (TSDHPT)
conducted a survey of the State Highway crossing of the Navasota River in 1977. Two
prehistoric sites, 41BZ36-41BZ37, were recorded. Both were recommended for further
testing. This information was taken from the TARL site files.
An archeological survey was conducted by the Cultural Resources Laboratory,
TAMU in 1980 of a proposed pipeline corridor (Baxter 1980). A pedestrian survey,
augmented by shovel testing, evaluated prehistoric site 41BZ22 previously recorded by
Sorrow and Cox (1973). It was concluded the site is not significant and no further work
was recommended.

7

An archeological survey was conducted by the Cultural Resources Laboratory,
TAMU in 1981 of seven tracts of land in Brazos, Grimes, Madison, Montgomery, and
Walker counties (Carlson 1981). The size of the project area is not mentioned in the
report. One prehistoric site (41BZ37), previously recorded by TSDHPT in 1977, was
examined. That part of 41BZ37 in the project area was disturbed and not considered
significant. No new sites were recorded.
The Archeological Research Laboratory, TAMU conducted an archeological
survey of the proposed Millican Landfill project in 1984 (Drollinger 1984). Eighty-eight
acres were examined by a pedestrian survey augmented by shovel testing. This survey
resulted in the recording of five prehistoric sites (41BZ78- 41BZ82) and six isolated
finds. Additional testing to determine site significance was recommended for sites
41BZ78, 41BZ79, and 41BZ81.
An archeological survey of the proposed Bryan Industrial Park was conducted by
the Archeological Research Laboratory, TAMU in August of 1984 (DeMarcay 1985). A
pedestrian survey and shovel testing of 112 acres resulted in the recording of three
historic sites, 41BZ71, 41BZ72, and 41BZ77. These sites were disturbed and no further
action was recommended.
In 1986, an archeological survey of the proposed Bryan Athletic Complex was
conducted by the Archeological Research Laboratory, TAMU (Drollinger 1986).
Pedestrian survey and shovel testing of a 60 acre tract resulted in the recording of one
historic site (41BZ86) producing artifacts dating to the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Testing of this site for significance was recommended if avoidance is not
possible.
Two prehistoric sites (41BZ87-41BZ88) and one historic site (41BZ89) were
recorded by TSDHPT in 1987. This work was done as
an evaluation of proposed State Highway 47. This information was taken from the
TARL site files.
An archaeological survey for the Coulter Field Environmental Assessment
Project was performed in 1989 by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore 1989a).
One historic site, a early twentieth century house site (41BZ92) was found in the 247.75
acre tract.
In 1990, TSDHPT conducted an assessment of the park and ride lots (9.5 acres)
along FM 2818 (Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation 1990).
One previously recorded site (41BZ73) was evaluated.
The environmental firm, Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc., surveyed a 5.9
kilometer transmission line in 1990 (Baxter 1990) and recorded two lithic scatters
(41BZ103 and 41BZ104).

8

A cultural resources survey by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc., was conducted
in 1991 (Gearhart 1991). Examination of three 2.3 hectare well pads recorded one
prehistoric lithic scatter as 41BZ105.
The first major project in the county since the Millican Reservoir study was
conducted by the Archeological Research Laboratory, TAMU, in 1991. A survey of
selected areas of a 530 acre tract resulted in the recording of eight sites (41BZ109 41BZ111; 41BZ119 - 41BZ123). Of this total, 2 sites are prehistoric, 4 are historic, and
2 contain both prehistoric and historic components. In addition, to the survey,
previously recorded site 41BZ1 was evaluated (report in preparation, Alston Thoms,
personal communication).
In May of 1992, the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) conducted a
survey of a portion of the proposed wastewater treatment plant on White Creek
approximately 3 miles southwest of the current project area and associated facilities
(Whitsett and Jurgens 1992). Six sites (41BZ112 - 41BZ117) were recorded. Testing
was recommended for two prehistoric sites (41BZ112 and 41BZ115) and archival
research for the historic component of 41BZ115. An additional survey was requested to
cover 102 acres not covered during their in-house investigation.
Following up the recommendations by TWDB, The Archeological Research
Laboratory, TAMU, surveyed the remaining 102 acres and recorded 41BZ118, a
probable farmstead complex occupied during the late 1800s and early 1900s (Thoms
1993). This site was considered to possess significant research potential and testing
was suggested if avoidance is not possible. Testing was also conducted at 41BZ112
and testing and archival work at 41BZ115. Site 41BZ115 was recommended for further
work if avoidance is not possible and that portion of 41BZ112 in the project area was
not considered significant.
Brazos Valley Research Associates has been involved in several recent cultural
resources investigations in Brazos County, two of which were in close proximity to the
current project area. In the spring of 1993, Archaeology Consultants, Inc. and Brazos
Valley Research worked together and examined 203 acres proposed for the site of the
Bush Presidential Library Center project (Moore and Warren 1993). Two prehistoric
sites (41BZ124 and 41BZ125) were recorded. Neither site was recommended for
additional work. The standing structures associated with the Swine Center on the
Texas A&M University campus were not considered significant.
Brazos Valley Research Associates surveyed a 12 acre Tiffany Park site in
Brazos County in the summer of 1993 and recorded a very disturbed historic site which
was recorded as 41BZ126 (Moore 1993b). This site was not considered to possess
research potential and no additional work was recommended.
Most recently, Brazos Valley Research Associates conducted a survey of the 14
acre Support Services Building site for Texas A&M University (Moore 1994). No sites
were found and it was recommended that work be allowed to proceed.

Historic Investigations in Brazos County
The only historic site to be examined by professional archaeologists is the
Richard Carter homestead (41BZ74) about five miles south of Coulter Field on Carter
Creek. At circa 1831, this is one of the earliest historic sites in Brazos County. It was
first excavated under the direction of Shawn Bonath Carlson (1983) of the Archeological
Research Laboratory, TAMU, in 1983.
Additional archeological investigations were conducted at this site in December
of 1985 as a prerequisite to development of a city park. Ninety-eight test units produced
artifacts typical of a mid-nineteenth century dwelling and further confirmed the presence
of the Carter homestead at that location. Based on this work, 41BZ74 was considered
eligible for State Archeological Landmark status. The fieldwork was directed by Shawn
Bonath Carlson (1987).
In July of 1985, Mt. Zion Baptist Church was recorded by Erwin Roemer and
William E. Moore as 41BZ85. This structure is believed to be the last remaining building
from the original Stone City community. This site was recorded during the 41BU16
project (Roemer and Carlson 1987).
In addition to the historic archaeological project mentioned above, various
aspects of Brazos County history have been documented in the form of books, theses,
and articles. A history of the county written for the Texas Sesquicentennial celebration
by the Brazos County Heritage and History Council and the Family History Foundation
is the most comprehensive study that has been done at this time. This book was written
by several authors and edited by Glenna Fourman Brundidge (1986).
Other relevant studies include a compilation of place names of Brazos County
from 1821-1880 by John Williams Diem (1981), a manuscript describing life in Bryan
during the period 1821-1921 by Mary Edna Dorsey (1976), a history of Brazos County
written by Elmer Grady Marshall (1937) for his masters thesis, an early history of Bryan
and the surrounding area by Joseph Milton Nance (1962), and a historical tour of
Brazos County compiled by students of Bryan High School (Ragsdale 1976).

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGY
The project area is located within the boundaries of a large region consisting of
eleven counties and described by Kotter (1981:30-34) in his discussion of the Millican
Reservoir project. According to Kotter (1981:30), this region forms a geographic and
environmental unit that exhibits traits that differ from nearby areas and cannot be
classified as belonging to any of the presently defined adjacent cultural expressions. In
his scheme the Brazos River forms the approximate western boundary and southern
Brazos and Grimes counties represent the southern boundary. Kotter's prehistoric
chronology is divided into three major periods or lifeways: Paleoindian, Archaic, and
Formative. This chronology is tentative and often relies on comparative data from
adjacent regions.
Paleoindian Period
The common conception of the Paleoindian period is the time following the last
ice age (Pleistocene) in North America when man wandered about the continent in
pursuit of megafauna such as mammoth, mastodon, and earlier species of bison.
Although not much is known about their diet, plants and other smaller animals probably
were as important to the Paleoindian as an occasional mammoth or other large animal.
Recent subsistence data in the region relate to this period. At site 41BZ76 on the
Brazos River evidence has been found that a mammoth may have been butchered by
Paleoindians about 10,000 years ago (Carlson, et al. 1984; Steele and Carlson 1989)
and sites on the Robertson County side of the Brazos River have produced freshwater
mussel shells associated with chert flakes that date to between 6000 and 8000 years
ago (Haywood and Waters 1990).
Paleo-Indians are also noted for the manufacture of unique and distinctive
projectile points. In Brazos County a variety of Paleo-Indian point types has been
found. Most of these specimens have been surface collected. Known types found in
Brazos County include Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Meserve, Plainview, San Patrice,
and Scottsbluff. Descriptions of these and other types mentioned in this section are
found in Turner and Hester (1985) and Suhm and Jelks (1962). Although dates for this
period are tentative, Paleoindians probably occupied the general area between 7000
and 8000 years ago (Prewitt 1981; Bond 1977; Shafer et al. 1975) and perhaps longer.
Sites with in situ deposits dating to the Paleo-Indian period, however, have been
few in number and none have been found in Brazos County. Sites that have produced
surface collected specimens include the Thurmond site, 41BZ2, 41BZ73, and 41BZ70.
Located just across the Brazos River in Burleson County is Winnies Mound (41BU17).
Excavation at this site by Bradley F. Bowman (1985) in 1983 resulted in the recovery of
two Paleo-Indian artifacts, a Plainview-like dart point and a San Patrice dart point. In
adjacent Grimes County an ongoing testing program by Espey, Huston & Associates,
Inc. has recovered evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation in the form of dart point types
Angostura, Dalton, and Lerma point (Rogers 1993:123).

11

Archaic Period
The Archaic period is generally defined as the time following the extinction of
Pleistocene megafauna during which small bands of hunters and gatherers roamed the
countryside in search of food in the form of plants and animals. The addition of
horticulture, pottery, and the bow and arrow are viewed as major technological changes
that led to the end of this period. During this time the overall population gradually
increased as evidenced by a greater number of sites. Kotter's (1981:31-34) discussion
of the Archaic for the Navasota River basin is divided into four phases, Early, Middle,
Late, and NeoArchaic.
The early Archaic is viewed by Kotter as a period of transition from the big-game
hunting traditions of Paleoindians to a broader based economy. He believes that during
the early stages of this period groups of people were utilizing Paleoindian technology
while practicing an Archaic economy. The Angostura type projectile point is considered
diagnostic of this early phase, although others classify it as Paleo-Indian. Although
most evidence of this phase occurs as single finds, apparent occupation sites are
reported within the Lake Limestone area (Prewitt and Mallouf 1977; Mallouf 1979). Site
41BU17, located just across the Brazos River in Burleson County has also produced
projectile points that have been dated as Early Archaic (Bowman 1985).
During the later phase of this period a diversification of stemmed projectile point
types and tool types appeared. This assumption is based on artifact types considered
typical of the early Archaic period in other areas of Texas. Diagnostic artifacts of this
phase include Gower, Hoxie, Axtell, Carrollton, Dawson, Trinity, and Wells types as well
as Waco sinkers and Clear Fork gouges.
Throughout the early Archaic period there appears to have been close affinities
with cultural areas to the west (Central Texas) and north (North-central Texas). Later
phase sites of the early Archaic period are more numerous in the northern portion of the
region and along mainstream river channels. The numbers decrease along lateral
tributary streams. Site records at TARL list one site (41BZ26) in Brazos County as early
Archaic.
The Middle Archaic period appears to be simply a continuation of those adaptive
strategies employed during the late Archaic discussed above. Kotter (1981:32) believes
that no significant changes in the basic exploitative strategies occurred since the early
Archaic.
The region defined by Kotter (1981) is situated on the western edge of the
geographical extent of the La Harpe Aspect as defined by Johnson (1962). Tool types
are comparable to those found in East Texas and, according to Kotter (1981:32), "may
lend some credence to the validity of the La Harpe Aspect as a generalized adaptive
system during the middle Archaic." Point types considered by some to be diagnostic of
this period include Yarbrough, Neches River, Pedernales, Morrill, and Dawson. Site
records at TARL do not list any sites in Brazos County as Middle Archaic. Projectile
points diagnostic of this period have been found at site 41BU16 on the Brazos River in
Burleson County (Roemer and Carlson 1987).

12

The late Archaic is marked by changes in subsistence orientation and an
increase in the intensity of influence from other cultural areas. For the first time there
was a marked exploitation of major river tributaries and other areas away from the
mainstream river channels. Prewitt and Grombacher (1974) believe the use of tributary
streams may be indicative of sporadic or seasonal exploitation and not semi-permanent
camps. The projectile point assemblage is characterized by a contracting stem
tradition, primarily the Gary type. Other diagnostic tools include Godley, Woden, Ensor,
Kent, Refugio, and Edgewood projectile points; Bristol and Erath bifaces; Bronson
knives; and Perkin pikes. Sandy paste ceramics associated with Gary points are
thought to occur throughout the area as well. Site records at TARL list four sites
(41BZ78, 41BZ79, 41BZ81, and 41BZ82) in Brazos County as probable Late Archaic.
The Neoarchaic is marked by the addition of arrow points and the use of
ceramics. Kotter (1981:33) believes few, if any, changes in subsistence strategies
occurred during this time. This argument is strengthened by the association of Gary
points and ceramics. No direct evidence of horticulture is known from this region. He
also states that the Neoarchaic period probably continued to the time of historic contact.
Cultural materials diagnostic of this period are common in the region. Neoarchaic sites
are found along both mainstream river and tributary environments indicating the same
localities exploited during the late Archaic were utilized. During the Neoarchaic, there is
a demonstrable relationship between this region and adjacent cultural areas. Trade and
cultural borrowing with groups in East, North-central, Southeast, and Coastal Texas is
believed to have been present.
The Formative Stage followed the Archaic and is viewed by Kotter (1981:34) as a
time when changes in social and economic organization, accompanying a dependence
on agriculture, occurred. This can be identified by the presence of mound and village
sites. However, if agriculture was practiced in the region it was probably not intensive
or widespread. Sorrow and Cox (1973) believe evidence of this stage in the region may
exist due to the large number of sites within their project area containing ceramics. Site
records at TARL do not list any sites in Brazos County as Formative.

HISTORIC CHRONOLOGY
Very little evidence of historic Indian groups has been found in the region.
Mallouf (1979) reported the presence of Poyner Engraved ceramics at some sites. This
type has been found at historic Indian sites in East Texas and may date from A.D. 1200
to A.D. 1700 (Suhm and Jelks 1962:123-125). The possibility of metal arrow points in
this region has been noted by Duffield (1960). The two historic Indian groups most
likely to have lived in Brazos County are the Bidais and Tonkawa. Kotter (1981:34)
believes archaeological sites with evidence of historic contact may exist in all portions of
this area. The scarcity of such sites, he believes, is due to the short time span of
occupation and the limited sample of cultural materials available from surface
examinations. Site records at TARL do not list any sites in Brazos County as Historic
Indian.
The earliest European activity in the area was by French and Spanish explorers
who were interested in claiming Texas for their countries. During the 17th and 18th
centuries many explorers passed through the area in an attempt to establish missions
and gain footholds in Texas. Of the many roads and trails created during this time, the
Old San Antonio Road (OSR) which connected Saltillo, Mexico with Natchitoches,
Louisiana forms the western boundary of Brazos County about 10 miles from the project
area.
The earliest settlement in this part of Texas was Pilar de Bucareli, established
near Natchitoches by the Spanish in 1774 for exiles from Los Adais Mission. Its
location was at the intersection of the La Bahia Road and Old San Antonio Road on the
east bank of the Trinity River about 60 miles northeast of the project area. The purpose
of this settlement was to support Spanish interests in the area (Bolton 1970:406-407). It
remained populated until 1779 when Indian raids, fire, and floods forced an
abandonment of the frontier (Victor 1981:236).
By the early 1800s, Texas was under the control of Mexico following a revolt
against Spain in 1810. Actual settlement of the area began in 1820 with the arrival of
Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred settlers. Mexico viewed American settlement
as a means of developing its northern state and raising capital through land sales (Miller
1986:8). The project area is located in the tract of land patented by Joseph E. Scott
between 1838 and 1841. Andrew Robinson, who established a ferry across the Brazos
River in 1821 about 40 miles southeast of the project area, was probably the first settler
to enter the Brazos Valley (Webb 1952:490). Andrew Millican moved to the area in
1821 and is recognized as the first Anglo-American settler to establish a home in
Brazos County. During this period the area was sparsely settled with most inhabitants
depending on agriculture for their livelihood. According to McKay (1986:2), only two
families were living in the county seat of Boonville as late as 1852. These pioneer
communities, according to Walker (1986:21), "retained their rural, agricultural nature
well into the twentieth century."

14

Victor (1981:239) credits the arrival of the railroad in 1860 as the beginning of the
second phase of settlement in Brazos County. McKay (1986:1) writes that before the
railroad, Brazos County was populated primarily by Southern agrarians living on
scattered farms and plantations along the river bottoms. The railroad changed the way
people lived. In 1870, for example, self-contained farmers were dominant and less than
half of Texas had been settled. By 1900, the entire state had been transformed into an
empire with commercial agriculture the main industry (Spratt 1983). In less than 30
years, Bryan became a permanent trade and population center with cotton the main
crop (McKay 1986:4). The population of Brazos County in 1870 was an increase of
232% since 1860 (McKay 1986:3). According to Diem (1981), Brazos County settlers
were not town builders. He states that Boonville was the only real town in existence
before 1860. Most of the development in the county resulted from the railroad. Bryan,
Millican, Benchley, and Wellborn were towns created because of the Houston and
Texas Central Railway.

The period from 1900 to 1938 is marked by increased growth, primarily due to the
continuation of the railroad as a major influence on the local economy and the
emergence of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas as a major college. A
major factor to growth in the immediate area, the railroad, was increased in 1901 when
the college granted a right-of-way near the project area to the Houston and Texas
Central Railway in 1901. Small farms, often managed by tenant farmers and
sharecroppers, continued to exist and subsistence farming with an occasional cash
crop, usually cotton, was common.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been
recorded in the project area. There was also no indication that any portion of the
proposed park site had been surveyed by professional archaeologists. Several
significant archaeological projects have been carried out in Brazos County and vicinity
with the closest being conducted by TAMU and Archaeology Consultants, Inc. on
nearby White Creek. Interviews with personnel at the Brazos County Appraisal District
indicated that, to the best of their knowledge, the area has been used for pasture. This
appears to be supported by the aerial photographs and soil survey for Brazos County.
The maps examined showed no evidence of industrial structures or disposal areas
within the project area.
The field survey did not locate any evidence of the presence of hazardous waste
within the project area. No oil sheen or discoloration on the water surface or on
vegetation was observed. This suggests to the geologist that no hydrocarbon pollution
of any significance exists in the area surveyed. Also, no evidence of structures other
than modern sewers, telephone lines, fences, and gates was found. No barrels, other
kinds of containers, or borrow pits were present. We observed that along the Holleman
street side at least two sewer access mains and two pvc pipes that may indicate ground
water monitoring may be ongoing. The stream was intermittent with ponds formed by
artificial dikes. The presence of cattle indicates the current use of the project area is
ranching. It seems reasonable to assume that ranching has been the primary use of
this tract. There is no indication at this time that a specific historic site is present within
the project area.
No prehistoric sites were found. It is the opinion of the archaeologist that this is
an area that may not have been deemed suitable for a campsite by the prehistoric
groups in the area. Probably any utilization of this area in prehistoric times was
temporary, and it is unlikely that evidence of temporary activities will be found utilizing
normal survey methods. The stream that flows through the project area is ephemeral at
this location and probably was not a dependable source of water in prehistoric times. In
fact, according to the topographic quadrangle, this stream ends less than 300 meters
from the project area.

16

RECOMMENDATIONS
No prehistoric sites were found to exist within the project area, and no historic
utilization except for evidence of farming and/or ranching was observed. Also, no
evidence of the presence of hazardous waste, past or present, was seen. Therefore, it
is recommended that the City of College Station be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. It is always possible that sites can be overlooked during any investigation
of this type. Should any evidence of a prehistoric site or historic site (other than the
farming/ranching features discussed earlier in this report) be discovered during park
construction it is recommended that the project be stopped until the situation can be
evaluated by the Texas Antiquities Committee. This recommendation is relevant only if
the project becomes subject to state or federal review.
