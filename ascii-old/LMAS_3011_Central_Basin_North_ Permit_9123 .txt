Lone Mountain Archaeological Services, Inc. (Lone Mountain) conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of every source point and every third receiver line and surveyed reroutes around
all archaeological sites encountered, in accordance with the scope of work. Lone Mountain
archaeologists Suzan O'Larick, Noel Pacheco, Brian Patton, Hudson Pauk, Steven Storer,
Richard Fransisco, Chelsea Winter, Randy Davis performed this survey from October 11 2019
through November 3, 2019 under Texas Antiquities Permit 9123. Douglas Boggess is serving
as Principal Investigator. The survey was conducted according to guidelines established in
Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas, published by the Council of Texas Archaeologists
and endorsed by the Texas Historical Commission. All project documentation will be curated

This part of Texas sits on four geological formations, including the Quaternary deposit, undivided; Sand sheet
deposits; Sandy deposits, undivided; and Maxon Sandstone and Glen Rose Limestone, undivided. The Quaternary deposit, undivided geologic formation was formed down during the Phanerozoic, Cenozoic, and Quaternary. The formation comprises sand, silt, clay, and gravel, locally indurated with calcium carbonate (caliche)
and includes point bar, natural levee, stream channel, sand dune, terrace, alluvial fan, landslide bolson and
playa deposits. The Sand sheet deposits, are windblown sand areas of large dunes on the Van Horn-El Paso
Sheet (1968) with sparse grass, moderate to very high permeability, low to moderate water-holding capacity
and a shallow water table formed during the Holocene. Sand deposits, undivided are windblown deposits,
sand sheets, dunes, and dune ridges undivided formed during the Holocene. Maxon Sandstone and Glen Rose
Limestone, undivided, are limestone, clay, and sandstone deposits formed during the early Cretaceous. A
number of soil types is present (Table 1.1).

The project area falls within the Trans-Pecos Vegetation region, giving way to the High Plains just to the north
and the Edward Plateau to the east. Vegetation is similar to that found within the Chihuahuan desert, and
includes creosote, mesquite, four-wing saltbush, tarbrush, acacia, soaptree yucca, prickly pear, cane cholla,
Christmas tree cholla, Spanish bayonet, ocotillo, horse crippler cactus, and various forbs and grasses. Surface
visibility is between 80 percent and 90 percent.

The surveyed space falls within a small sample of the High Plains of west Texas, near enough to the neighboring Trans-Pecos and Edwards Plateau to contain various times cultural traits familiar to archaeologists working
in the those areas. The current project is an intensive, non-collection, pedestrian survey. Given the location of
the survey area, it is possible that a wide range of cultural resources will be found and must be placed in an
established cultural context in order for their data potential to be fully realized.

Human settlement in North America is first identified during the Paleoindian period (10,500 to 6500 B.C.).
Despite some evidence indicating a human presence in the New World earlier than 10,500 B.C., Anderson and
Faught (2000) argue that current evidence is insufficient to describe any cultural trends prior to the appearance of the Clovis complex at around 10,500 B.C., Hayden's (1976) arguments for the Malpais pre-San Dieguito/San Dieguito material notwithstanding (Heilen 2004). The Paleoindian period is characterized by a
subsistence strategy focused on hunting now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna, including Bison antiquus and

3

Plano sites are generally thought of as forming the terminal elements of the Paleoindian big game hunting tradition. Plano is known for a number of artifact complexes. Each complex is distinguished by a series of large
lanceolate and unfluted projectile points, including Angostura, Frederick, Firstview, and Scottsbluff.

Although Paleoindian groups probably utilized small game and plant foods in addition to large game species,
a change in subsistence strategy to full reliance on these food sources marks the transition to the Archaic from
the Paleoindian period. Large-scale climatic changes and the extinction of megafauna caused people to
develop a more diverse subsistence base. Mobility was cyclical and more restricted in extent, compared to
Paleoindian strategies. Once productive resource procurement locations were established, these were often
reused on a seasonal basis.
This change in food procurement is marked by wide-ranging changes in the Archaic tool assemblage. While
Paleoindian assemblages consist mainly of projectile points and meat processing tools, a growing number of
groundstone implements suggest a greater reliance on plant foods at this time. Archaic projectile points are
shorter than those of the Paleoindian period, and larger than arrow points used during the following Ceramic
period. Points of this period are generally stemmed or corner-notched, and exhibit more extensive morphological variability and less precision in the quality of manufacture than those of the Paleoindian period.

Folsom sites date from 9000 to 8200 B.C. The Folsom complex exhibits technological distinctions from the
Clovis complex. Diagnostic projectile points include fluted Folsom and unfluted Midland points, which are similar in outline. In addition to these points, the tool assemblages include spoke shaves, end scrapers, perforators, knives, denticulates, drills, choppers, awls, and abrading stones (Cordell 1997). These artifacts are often
found in association with bison kill sites, such as that found in Crane County at 41CR10, known as the Hot
Tubb Site.

Three distinct complexes have been identified in west Texas for the Paleoindian period: Clovis, Folsom, and
Plano (a Dalton complex is known in the east). In general archaeological sites are assigned to particular complexes of the Paleoindian period based on the presence of distinctive diagnostic projectile points. The earliest
complex, Clovis, generally dates from as early as 10,500 to 9000 B.C. The tool assemblage is characterized by
Clovis points (which are bifacially worked lanceolate projectile points with a concave base), transverse end
scrapers, side scrapers, bifacial knives, gravers, perforators, and hammerstones (Cordell 1997).

mammoth. Diagnostic stone tools associated with this period include end scrapers and large, unstemmed lanceolate projectile points, which are often fluted. It is postulated that during this period, points were attached
to thrusting spears. A reliance on big game hunting has been established, but it is unclear to what extent
these people exploited other available resources such as plants (Judge 1982). Little evidence has been found to
suggest the use of structures during this period. From negative evidence, it has been assumed that people
lived a nomadic lifestyle with the use of structures apparently uncommon.

The Archaic period is typically divided into an Early (6500 to 3500 B.C.), Middle (3500 to 1200 B.C.) and Late
Archaic (1200 B.C. to A.D. 700), with the last few four hundred years between A.D. 300 and 700 referred to
as a Transitional period, when new technologies such as pottery and the bow and arrow seem to have slowly
come into use.

The Late Prehistoric period is characterized by the adoption of the bow and arrow and the frequent use of
pottery. Much of the pottery found in the area may include many of the same types also found in southeastern
New Mexico (e.g., brownwares and Chupadero Black-on-white, a decorated type frequently made in central
New Mexico) as well as Bullard Brushed, a Late Prehistoric Caddoan type. The earliest use of ceramics in southeastern New Mexico was initially suggested to have occurred between A.D. 600 and 900 (Lehmer 1948, Corley 1965, Jelinek 1967). However, radiocarbon dates obtained from Deadman's Shelter, between Amarillo and
Lubbock indicate that Jornada Brown may have appeared as early as A.D. 200 (Hughes and Willey 1978).
While the appearance of villages next to agricultural fields and reliable water sources appears to have accom-

The Spanish may have entered west Texas prior to A.D. 1536, when Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca, surviving a
shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico, possibly passed through west Texas or portions of northern Mexico just to the
south. He may even have crossed into southeastern Arizona before he made his way south into Mexico (Covey
1983), though others argue that he was already well to the south in northern Mexico (e.g., Weber 1992).
Castle Gap, a pass located on west edge of Upton County, just east of Crane County, may, however, be
described in Cabeza de Vacas report (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rkc12). Cabeza de Vaca's
initial report concerning the lands to the north led to a 1539 expedition by Fray Marcos de Niza. Cabeza de
Vaca's and de Niza's reports in turn prompted Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado to lead the 1540 expedition in
search of riches to be found in the fabled cities of "Quivira" (Katz and Katz 1985). This portion of Texas came
to be used as a route by later Spanish explorers to areas south and east. Coronado likely passed well to the
north of the surveyed area while returning from Quivira. In 1629, Franciscan friars Juan de Salas and Diego de
Leon left northern New Mexico to visit the Jumanos in the vicinity of what is now San Angelo, Texas, followed
by Father Juna de Ortega in 1632. Other expeditions that may have passed near the area were led Diego de
Castillo and Hernan Martin in 1650, followed by the Diego de Guadalara expedition of 1654, both sent from
Santa Fe to look for freshwater pearls on the Concho River to the south and east.

The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period is sometimes referred to as the Protohistoric period. Projectile points decrease in size, with small triangular points becoming the predominant type.
Many early Protohistoric sites appear to have been contemporary with Ochoa-phase settlements and may represent the appearance of Athabaskans in the region. The Spanish encountered Jumano (first called Teya) and
Apache (Querecho) groups in the area, and with European contact, metal projectile points appeared. The
Kiowa to the north speak a Tanoan language similar to that spoken in the Tanoan pueblos (Newcomb 1961).
Jelinek (1967) has suggested the Jornada Mogollon from the Fort Sumner area formed the ancestral core of
the Kiowa, who then ranged north and east pursuing bison, while the Jumano are possibly descended from
more southerly Jornada Mogollon (Newcomb 1961). However, establishing such pedigrees is difficult considering how poorly understood the movements of populations are at the end of the Late Prehistoric period and
throughout the Protohistoric period.

Crane County is located just west of the Edwards Plateau, identified as the âClassic Toyah culture areaâ falling
within the âShared Toyah areaâ (Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012). The Toyah phase dates between A.D. 1300 and
1700. Toyah sites often include Perdiz, Fresno, Harrell, and Garza points and may have locally made bone-tempered pottery (e.g., Leon Plain) as well as Southwestern and Caddoan tradewares. The lithic toolkits found on
Toyah sites suggest an economic focus on bison hunting.

panied these new technologies in neighboring regions, current evidence suggests that life in much of this part
of the Southern Plains continued to resemble that of the preceding Archaic period, with an increased reliance
on bison toward the end of the period.

Native groups present in the area during the Spanish Colonial period were nomadic. Early Spanish records
indicate several native groups on the Llano Estacado including Apaches, Querechos, Vaqueros, and Teyas. Apachean groups extended their range to the southern portion of the state sometime in the 1500s. By about
1630, the Apache were ranging as far south along the Pecos as the Seven Rivers area. During the early 1700s,
Comanches and their allies drove the Apache from the Plains, and the surveyed area fell near the southern
edge of the Comanche and Kiowa range by the late 1700s. Some Apache settled in the Pecos Valley and in
the mountains of southeastern New Mexico while others moved into central Texas and northern Mexico. By
the early to mid-1800s Comancheros had established trade with the Comanche, and other residents of the
Plains. There were no permanent settlements in the area by Pueblo or Hispanic groups during the Spanish
Colonial period (Olmsted 1975). Originally a part of Tom Green County as organized in 1874, Crane County
was established in 1887, but not officially organized until 1927, following oil and gas discoveries. The county
was named for a president of Baylor University. Crane County currently is home to 4,375 people engaged in
ranching and oil and gas production.Lone Mountain archaeologists performed this survey between October
11, 2019 and November 3, 2019.

Any cultural remains predating 1968 (whether an isolated occurrence or a site) and all previously-recorded sites
within 50 ft of the survey corridor were to be recorded. Isolated occurrences and the locations of any not-relocated previously-recorded sites within 50 ft of the survey corridor were to be photographed and shovel tested
(as described below). At least six shovel tests were to be excavated to find a site boundary and to evaluate the
vertical integrity of a site.

Isolated occurrences are cultural remains that do not qualify as sites. They generally consist of single artifacts or
artifact scatters that are of extremely low density and are widely dispersed, and are indicative of a single or
unintentional activity. Isolated occurrences are often found in redeposited context and cannot be related to
other nearby sites or isolated occurrences. In addition, isolated occurrences are generally 50 years old or older,
although Lone Mountain may record more recent materials as isolates if there is a sound reason for documenting their presence. Isolated occurrences were recorded in the field on the Lone Mountain isolated occurrence
form, a GPS reading was taken, and their locations were plotted on the USGS quadrangle.

Lone Mountain conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of every source line and every third receiver line. Survey corridors were 50 ft wide. Archaeologists walked 15-m interval transects and excavated 197 shovel tests
outside of those performed for discoveries (sites and isolated occurrences as described below). Especially intensive low-interval survey was conducted in areas where previously-recorded sites were expected within or near
the project area. Reroutes were surveyed around archaeological sites, regardless of NRHP eligibility or any
other measure of significance under THC guidelines.

This survey was conducted according to guidelines established in Texas Antiquities Permit 9123 and Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas, published by the Texas Historical Commission. Data for this project were
gathered employing traditional pedestrian survey methodology coupled with shovel testing when appropriate.
Photograph and feature logs were maintained. Forms and paperwork used in the field were intended to facilitate the easy entry of a site description into the TexSite system. Data collection conducted (GPS location of
finds, characterization of fire-cracked rock, photographing of diagnostic artifacts, etc.) in the field also serves
to address a basic research orientation that is achievable during an archaeological survey for a low impact
undertaking such as this.

one Mountain conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of every source point and every
third receiver line and surveyed reroutes around all archaeological sites encountered.

Sites may be defined as a certain number of cultural materials greater than 50 years in age, such as 10 or more
artifacts in a 15 sq m area, or one or more features. Cultural resource sites are extremely variable in size, and
range from a cluster of several objects or materials to structures with associated objects and features. A site
may consist of secondarily deposited cultural resource remains. Features such as hearths, cairns, rock alignments, masonry concentrations, burned adobe, fire-cracked rock concentrations, cists, corrals, and rock art are
generally recorded as sites. Sites also include definite locations of traditional cultural or religious importance to
specified social or cultural groups. A site may be less than 50 years old if it can be demonstrated that a property has achieved exceptional importance within the past 50 years (Criterion Consideration G).

All observed cultural material was recorded according to Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) guidelines. No
artifacts or samples were collected.

Settings that were deemed to have potential for buried cultural deposits included those surveyed lines crossing
soils that are deeper and more likely to contain subsurface cultural remains. Dunal areas and playa, basin, or
drainage edges were selected as particularly likely to contain such deposits. Lone Mountain excavated 197
shovel tests in these settings, finding no otherwise undiscovered buried cultural remains (Appendix A).
Portions of the surveyed lines crossed existing networks of roads, well pads, tank batteries, flowlines, in-use
and abandoned pipelines, and other oilfield-related installations. These disturbances either destroy or expose
otherwise buried cultural remains. Settings with the appropriate soil types that had less visible or extensive
areas of prior disturbance were selected therefore for shovel testing. Testing intervals varied at times from the
16 per mile recommended in the THC survey standards and depended on the judgment of the surveying
archaeologists to focus on locations that retained a potential for buried cultural remains. As the depths of
sandy Holocene deposits can vary, especially in dunal settings, Lone Mountain excavated tests with a shovel to
depths of at least 40 cm to 60 cm, and continued tests with a 10 cm bucket auger to end at the maximum
length of the auger or on a cemented material such as caliche or an impenetrable hardpan (as described in
Tables 1.1 through 1.4).
Shovel tests were to be 30 cm in diameter or on a side and excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits, if
possible. They were dug in levels no thicker than 10 cm with sediments screened through Â¼-inch mesh unless
high clay or water content required that they be troweled through.

Shovel testing was to be conducted at all isolated occurrences, sites, the locations of not-relocated previouslyrecorded sites, any settings that had potential for buried cultural materials, and places that had a low surface
visibility due to excessive vegetation (less than 30 percent surface visibility, except on slopes greater than 20
percent). Features that were trowel or shovel tested were otherwise left in place.

The documentation of historic homesites (and other historic resources) was to include archival research and
historic context.

C H AP T E R

If sites were encountered, boundaries were defined according to Texas guidelines. Artifacts and features were
marked and site boundaries were determined by the distribution of these marked cultural materials. Sites were
recorded using a Lone Mountain Site Record form. A sketch map was drawn of each site, and site locations
were plotted on the appropriate USGS quadrangle. Digital photographs were taken showing the setting, any
features, a sample of nondiagnostic artifacts, and any temporally diagnostic artifacts (ceramics and points). A
representative sample of artifacts from each site was recorded using Lone Mountain artifact analysis forms.
Drawings of diagnostic or representative formal tools were made. Lone Mountain conducted shovel testing at
each site and examined rodent burrows, road cuts, drainages, and other disturbed locations to determine if
subsurface cultural deposits were present. Buried charcoal, ash, artifacts, burned rock, or buried cultural strata
constitute subsurface cultural materials. If shovel testing failed to locate strong evidence of buried cultural
deposits, trowel scrapes were performed.

Trowel probes were conducted in features on archaeological sites and are used to evaluate the data potential
of possible hearth features and establish the depth of charcoal deposits and are intended to be minimally
intrusive. If shovel testing failed to indicate that extensive buried cultural deposits were present on a site, Lone
Mountain excavated and screened at least four 50 cm by 50 cm trowel scrapes to a depth of no more than 10
cm.

Lone Mountain was to evaluate each archaeological site for NRHP eligibility as well as State Archaeological
Landmark status. The key criterion for most prehistoric sites is the potential of the site to contain additional
data relevant to future research (i.e., NRHP Criterion D). The potential for important additional data is often
dependent on the presence or absence of buried cultural deposits. On each site, the possibility of buried cultural deposits was assessed by a variety of means as noted above. Observations were noted regarding the like-

1.The site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history of
Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2.the site's archaeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3.the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
4.the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge. and
5. there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and the official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively, further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site cannot be
protected. (Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Rule 26.10)

Because the survey area is located on University Lands, sites are also assessed for eligibility for designation as
State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL), as detailed in Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Rule 26.10. Criteria to
be considered include:

Partially buried late historic and recent materials observed throughout the project area indicate that eolian processes operate at a rapid pace. In many environments, when the phrase âburied cultural materialâ is used, the
term âintactâ is usually implied. However, in an active dunal environment where burial, deflation, and reburial
of cultural strata may take place over the matter of just a few years, evidence for buried cultural material is not
necessarily evidence for intact buried cultural material. This adds another layer of difficulty to the evaluation of
sites. However, even a deflated site may be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP, especially if more
than 100 artifacts are present. In the case of historic sites, NRHP Criteria A, B, and C are more likely to be relevant. The relationship between the resources within the project area and the historical context of the project
area were taken into account when evaluating these sites.

lihood of buried cultural deposits based on several characteristics. For example, indications of potential site
depth include stratigraphic soil profiles exposed along road cuts and arroyos or cultural materials in the backdirt piles of rodent burrows.

The THC Texas Archaeological Site Atlas indicates that one previous linear survey has passed through or very
near the southern edge of the survey area. This is TAC permit 8307, Atlas no.8500080817, performed in 2018
by SWCA for the Crane to Midland Pipeline project. This survey did not encounter any archaeological sites
within the survey area. No sites have been found within the survey area. The closest previously recorded site is
41CR28, located approximately 900 m east of the survey area at the base of Concho Bluff. 41CR28 was
