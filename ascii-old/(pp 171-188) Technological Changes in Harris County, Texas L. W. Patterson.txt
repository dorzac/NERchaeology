TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN
HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS*
L. W. PATTERSON
ABSTRACT
Technological changes through time for prehistoric sites in Harris
County, Texas are reviewed, for a time interval from the Middle Archaic to
the late prehistoric. Significant changes occur in flake tool sizes, ceramic
usage, and the frequency and size of sites. A number of artifact types are
also considered where little change occurs with time. Information
presented is based on 26 sites, and demonstrates the value of intensive
surface survey work.

INTRODUCTION
This paper will review changes in technology among various Indian
populations occupying inland Harris County, Texas, from the Middle
Archaic period until late prehistoric time. There seems to be little
change in the general cultural pattern over this time interval, with a
hunting and gathering lifeway practiced, and no evidence of
agriculture. According to the account of Cabeza de Vaca (Covey
1972), a nomadic hunting and gathering pattern was still being
practiced in this area in early historic period. Since a nomadic way of
life is involved, the technology to be discussed probably reflects
seasonal use of campsites.
A survey by Wheat (1953) represents the most significant published
work done in this inland area of Harris County. McClure (1975) is
continuing to publish a series of site surveys along inland White Oak
Bayou in Harris County. The writer is also continuing to publish a
series of site surveys for Harris County (Patterson 1975d). Shafer
(1968) has published information on inland sites in nearby
Montgomery County and Aten (1967) has reported in Jamison site in
Liberty County. Most studies in the general area have concentrated
on littoral sites (cf. Aten 1971; O’Brien 1971). Littoral sites are rich in
shell, bone and ceramics, but relatively poor ia lithic materials,
except for a site reported by Duke (1970, 1971). In contrast, inland
sites have large quantities of lithic materials, smaller amounts of
pottery, poor bone preservation, and little shell. Some inland sites in
Harris County do have enough bone preservation, however, to give a
picture of which animals were utilized (Wheat 1953: Table 8; Smith
1975). No information is yet available on plant remains. Although
shell fish occur in fresh-water streams, there is little evidence to
indicate that they were an important food source. Seasonal

subsistence patterns and the relationship of inland to littoral sites
remain poorly known. Dillehay’s (1975) study on coastal subsistence
is practically the only problem-oriented work done to date. Shafer
(1974:2-3) has pointed out that most work in southeastern Texas has
been subject to the vagaries of salvage archeology, without a
designed research plan. This paper is a summary of a number of sites
of various dates, and demonstrates the value of intensive surface
survey work, especially when resources are not available for a large
excavation program.

CHRONOLOGY
In considering changes in material technology through time, it is
necessary to establish a basic chronology related to artifact types. A
synthesis of chronology for this specific area indicates three basic
periods, which will be called Archaic, Woodland (cf. Shafer 1975),
and late prehistoric. The Archaic is the earliest period considered
here and is preceramic, the Woodland period has ceramics and dart
points, but few bifacial arrow points, and the late prehistoric period
has predominantly bifacial arrow points and few dart points. It
should be made clear that names for these periods on the upper Texas
coast do not have the same cultural meaning as in other areas, since
the basic living pattern remained essentially in the Archaic tradition
until historic time.
The stratigraphy at the Doering site (Wheat 1953) has been used to
establish the relative chronology of artifact types, but Wheat
established no absolute dates. Aten (1971: Fig. 10) gives a date of 200
A.D. for the earliest ceramics in this area, and A.D. 600 for the start
of bifacial arrow points, which can be used to define the terminal
Archaic and Woodland dates. A starting date of about 3000 B.C. for
the earliest materials discussed here in the Archaic period is taken
from the estimates of Suhm and ]elks (1962: 1969,171) for the start of
Bulverde and Carrollton dart points. There is a Carrollton focus
radiocarbon date (Smith 1969: 5) related to these point types with
special note taken of ground bases on Carrollton and Trinity points
during this period.
It may be seen in Table 1 that a number of projectile point types are
found over long time periods. Several of Wheat’s provisional types
have been reclassified, using current terminology. Bulverde, Trinity,
Carrolltan, and Williams are among the earliest types of Archaic dart
points shown. Except for Perdiz points, Wheat shows a well defined
starting time for bifacial arrow points, including Catahoula, Fresno,
and Scallorn. The Perdiz point will be discussed further with the
chronology of the bow and arrow. Gary contracting stem dart points
are found throughout the entire time interval under discussion, of
perhaps 4,500 years, and are most numerous in the Woodland period.

A number of dart points that Wheat illustrates as Gary (1953: P1.36)
should probably be classified as Kent type.
There are a number of dart point types that start in the middle to
late Archaic period, and continue into the Woodland period. These
include Ensor, Ellis, Elam, Pedernales, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Trinity,
and Wells. Since a number of dart point types seem to have long time
spans, they are not very useful as specific time markers, except to
note that they are earlier than the late prehistoric period. Carrolltonand Williams dart points may be specific to the Archaic period, as is
perhaps the practice of basal grinding. Various combinations of
arrow points, dart points and ceramics can be used to identify the
three broad time periods under discussion. Fig. 1 shows basally
ground Williams, Trinity, and Carrollton dart points from site 41 HR
206 in inland Harris County. Ground base dart points are
characteristic of the middle Archaic period, and are the earliest
artifacts found in this survey. Gary dart points tend to become
smaller in later time, as noted by Ford and Webb (1956) for Poverty
Point. This is true for Harris County sites, with Gary points generally
of 50 to 70 mm length in the Archaic period, and 30 to 45 mm length in
the Woodland period. Table 4 summarizes projectile points found in
this survey in relationship to time periods.

SITE PATTERNS

Archeological materials from 48 sites in inland Harris County were
reviewed. There were 26 of these sites with projectile points, and
these were selected for this study. There are nine late prehistoric, six
mixed late prehistoric/Woodland, five Woodland, one mixed
Archaic/Woodland, one pure Archaic, and four mixed with all time
periods. The multi-component sites are predominantly mixed
Archaic/Woodland, and will be treated as such in the statistical
summaries. By time periods, then, there are 19 sites with late
prehistoric components, 16 Woodland, and six Archaic. As shwam in
Fig. 2, sites with only late components tend to have fewer lithic
artifacts. It is concluded that a larger number of small sites were
used in late time, with less use frequency, compared to a few large
sites in the Archaic and early Woodland.

If a time period of 4,500 years is used for the range of sites under
discussion, both Wheat’s work and more recent surveys by the writer
show that projectile point production was fairly constant with time.
This may be an indication of roughly constant population density over
long time periods, although population density could vary considerably at specific times. The period of A.D. 600 to 1500 for biracial arrow points is 20% of the total time interval considered.
Referring to Table 2, Wheat (1953: 198-199) showed that arrow points
were 16.5% of total projectile points, and recent work by the writer
gives 19.7% of total points as bifacial arrow points. If there is any
indication at all of a population maximum, it would be during the late
Archaic and Woodland periods.

CERAMICS
Wheat (1953) developed information on pottery for this area, and
Aten (1971: Fig. 10) has added further details and dating. Plain
ceramics start at about A.D. 200, there is also a stamped design type,
which is rare and probably has rather short duration. Then Goose
Creek sandy paste pottery starts and continues through late
prehistoric time. Both Wheat and Aten note some use of bone
tempering in late time, and this is confirmed on more recently found
sites, such as 41 HR 248. Because of its short duration, stamped
pottery in Harris County is a good time reference, and possibly
matches the starting times of sites 41 HR 6, 7, and 267. Incised pottery
has wide time distribution, but is fairly scarce, as noted by Wheat
(1953: Table 1), and this more recent survey. A summary of incised
patterns has been given by O’Brien (1971: 345), which possibly
applies to this area. The most common pattern found in recent survey
work is single line interior incising. Only 2.8% of all sherds examined
had any type of incising. O’Brien (1974: 57) has commented on the
possible significance in time of incised patterns and rim shapes. Few
rim sherds were found in survey work for this report.
Wheat (1953: 191) noted that there was a lower amount of pottery
in late strata, and recent survey sites seem to confirm lower amounts
in the late prehistoric period on inland sites. This could mean less use
of pottery and/or a lower frequency of site use. It is felt that less
pottery was used in the late prehistoric period because the ratio of
potsherds to flakes decreases then. Together with the information
that sites tended to be smaller and more numerous in late time, this
may indicate a shift in subsistence pattern after the Woodland
period. Fig. 3 is a plot of sherd-to-flake ratio versus time, and
definitely shows a peak at the end of the Woodland period. Potsherd
counts probably have value in a relative comparison of sites of
different ages, but on an absolute basis sherd counts are probably

176

low. Due to poor firing techniques used in the manufacture of local
pottery, there is some disintegration of potsherds. During wet
weather the author has observed potsherds in the process of total
disintegration on several sites, including 41 HR 215. As mentioned
previously, pottery on inland Harris County sites is not as plentiful as
on littoral sites.
There are no noticeable differences in ceramic thicknesses with
time. Sites in general have a range of thicknesses for potsherds from 4
to 9 ram. The average of 4 late prehistoric sites is 6.0 mm and the
average for Archaic/Woodland site 41 HR 206 is 6.3 mm.
THE BOW AND ARROW
In previous papers (Patterson 1973a,b), the writer has
hypothesized that the bow and arrow diffused to Texas from the far

north during the Archaic period, together with small prismatic blade
technology, using the Mesolithic type compound point. The presence
of the compound point in Alaska has been demonstrated by Larsen
(1968: 54). Another example of early use of the bow and arrow, closer
to Texas, is the occurrence of crude unifacial arrow points at the
LoDaisKa site in Colorado (Irwin and Irwin 1959: 34-37), earlier than
bifacial arrow points. Possible elements for compound arrow points
occur throughout the various time periods being reviewed for Harris
County. The side blades are similar to Eurasian microliths, in that
they are unifacial segments of prismatic blades, have a straight edge
for hafting, and have the other lateral edge trimmed to a rough
geometrical shape. Unifacial end blades are both stemmed and
unstemmed (Patterson and Sollberger 1974}.
The writer has elsewhere speculated (Patterson 1973c) that the
Perdiz arrow point evolved from the Gary dart point, as there is a
roughly continuous grading in size from Gary dart points to Perdiz
arrow points. As shown in Table 1, Wheat found Perdiz points
starting much earlier than other biracial arrow points, but he tended
to dismiss this data. It is felt that this evidence should be considered
as an example of a development period for an arrow point form from
a dart point form, with the bow and arrow already in use with simpler
unifacial points. There are a number of other arrow point/dart point
similarities in this area, such as Almagre/Cliffton, Ellis/Scallorn, and
Matamoros/Fresno. Sollberger (1967, 1970) has noted similar
relationships.

Study of the weight distribution for contracting stem points in
Harris County also suggests evolution of arrow point forms from dart
point forms, as sho’cm in Fig. 4. Dart points weighing over 6.5 grams
are found in Archaic context, and smaller dart points weighing 3.5 to
6 grams are found in late Archaic and Woodland contexts. There is a
discrete group of points found only on Woodland and later sites,
weighing 2 to 3 grams, which suggest a multi-purpose use for both
dart and arrow points. Biracial arrow points found mainly on late
prehistoric sites form another discrete group under 2 grams in
weight.
Since possible unifacial elements for compound arrow points exist
even on later prehistoric sites, the compound arrow point or at least
unifacial end blades may have been in use concurrent with biracial
arrow points. This is not too surprising, when consideration is given
to some of the crude, almost unifacial Cliffton points found together
with well made Perdiz points. A possible example of transition to

PRISMATIC BLADE TECHNOLOGY
Small prismatic blade technology in Harris County exists in fairly
constant quantities for all time periods under discussion. Blade cores,
blades, and retouched blade tools have also been found for all time
periods. Since blade technology is so generalized (Patterson 1973a,b),
with a variety of blade core types, it has not been possible to relate
blade core types to specific time intervals, possibly because small
blade technology diffused in a generalized form. Wedge-shaped and
semi-conical cores seem to start early, and conical cores have been
found in all time periods. A unique example of a discoidal blade core,
with four striking platforms, was found on a mixed Woodland/Late
Prehistoric site, 41 HR 248. This core is close to one illustrated by
Montet-White (1968: Fig. 6) for the late Archaic/early Woodland
period in Illinois.
Prismatic blades from Harris County are referred to as a "small
blade technology," distinct from larger Paleo-Indian blades. Most
Harris County blades are under 20 mm in width, while published
examples of Paleo-Indian blades generally average over 20 mm in
width (Converse 1973: 14; Hammatt 1969). A starting time of 3000 B.C.
for small blade technology in Texas would be consistent with
Borden’s chronology for southward diffusion of small blade
technology from Alaska, and the early Magic Mountain, Colorado
date of 3500 B.C. (Irwin-Williams and Irwin 1966: Fig. 59) for

180

microblades. Various prismatic blade traditions have been discussed
in a separate paper [Patterson 1975b).
Prismatic blade technology follows a general tendency of lithic
flakes to become smaller on late sites. Microblades of under 11 mm
width are found on even the earliest sites, however. Table 3 shows
that prismatic blades, and microlithic side and end blades occur
throughout the entire time interval under consideration. The
percentages of prismatic blades shown are higher than in a previous
report (Patterson 1973b), because more material has been found, and
small irregular flakes below 15 mm square are no longer counted.

FLAKE TOOLS
By far the most important artifacts in number on these sites are
utilized general-purpose flint flake tools. As Sollberger (1969) has
shown, sharp unretouched flake edge make excellent cutting tools. A
number of flakes and prismatic blades occur, without definite time
significance, with unifacial marginal retouch that could be classified
as side and end scrapers. Noticeable heavy retouch by pressure
flaking is not frequent. Most utilized flakes simply display use
retouch. Wheat’s collection of selected artifacts from this area at the
Smithsonian Institution was examined, with the same conclusion as
more recent finds.
What is really significant about flake tools is the tendency toward
smaller size in later time. As may be seen in Fig. 5, this becomes
pronounced in the Woodland period and later, after 200 A.D. Size
change appears to be evolutionary, rather than sudden. Through the
Archaic period, the three size ranges used for this study occur in
about equal proportions. After the start of the Woodland period,
there are increases in the percentage of smaller flakes of 15 to 20 mm
square, and decreases in the percentages of the two larger flake
categories, of 20 to 25 mm and over 25 mm. Sharer (1974: 14) has
noted the shift to smaller lithic tools in late prehistoric time in
southeastern Texas, and Dee Ann Story (personal communication)
notes this same tendency in other parts of Texas.
Flake size categories are arbitrary selections, and a rapid accurate
method was used to measure the large number of flakes. A size range
of 15 to 20 mm indicates that a flake is larger than a 15 by 15 mm
square and will fit inside of a 20 mm square. Other size ranges use
larger squares for measurement. No special flake orientation or
tedious use of calipers is required. A rapid method becomes a
necessity when large numbers of flakes are involved.
Harris County has what could be called a "thin flake industry,"
with most flakes ranging from 2 to 5 nun in thickness. Few thick flake
tools are present. Use of smaller flake tools in later time possibly
indicates a shift in technology, more efficient use of a scarce

182

resource, or possibly even increased mobility in lifestyle. If more
hafting was used with smaller flakes, it is not directly apparent, as no
special preparation for halting, such as notches, is generally present.

LITHIC MATERIALS
A previous paper [Patterson 1974} has commented on types of lithic
materials used in Harris County. In general, there does not appear to
be any time significance in materials used for lithic artifacts.
Assemblages reflect what would be expected of flint sources within
25 to 100 miles, with an occasional find of possibly more remote
origin. The uses of petrified wood and red jasper for projectile points
are exceptions. For dart points, petrified wood was over-utilized and
jasper was under-utilized, compared to the amounts of these
materials occurring on various sites. Harris County itself has no
significant lithic resources. For arrow points, the situation is
reversed. Petrified wood is practically never used, and red jasper
begins to be used with a frequency close to its general distribution on
sites. There is some use of jasper for small late dart points.

CLAY BALLS
Roughly shaped clay balls or "blobs" are found on Archaic and
Woodland sites in Harris County. Smith (1969: 6) has noted the
presence of this type of material in the Archaic period of the Dallas
area. Late prehistoric sites in Harris County have few clay balls. Aten
(1967: 39), Ambler (1967: Table 3), Patterson (1975a: 13, 1975c: 18),
and Shafer (1968: 74) have made comments on the occurrence of clay
balls in this general area. The function of clay balls has not been fully
determined, although most appear to be fire-baked. Perhaps they
were used for cooking, as the more precisely shaped Poverty Point
examples, Huxtable, et al (1972) have dated clay balls in the
Mississippi Valley to both Archaic and Woodland periods. As with
clay balls, fire-cracked rock does not seem to occur on late sites.

BIFACIAL TOOLS
Bifacial non-projectile point tools are not time-diagnostic in Harris
County. This has been shown by Wheat (1953: Table 6) for a wide time
range. Contrary to Wheat’s information on the Doering site, bifacial
tools do not occur as high percentages of lithic assemblages on Harris
County sites. Wheat seems to have struck a cache of bifacial tools on
the Doering site, not duplicated by his other sites, or by the writer’s
later survey work. After examining Wheat’s collection at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, it is concluded that a number of
Wheat’s bifacial tools are actually projectile points or preforms,
resembling, in a morphological sense, the Lermo, Tortugas, and
Refugio types. Thus, Wheat’s count of bifacial tools is on the high side.
Finer pressure flaking is observed on what few bifacial tools occur on
late sites.

CONTINUITY
Most of this paper has been devoted to examining technological
changes. There are a number of traits that may demonstrate some
continuity of the Archaic lifeway, in contrast to changes being considered. For this specific area, over the approximately 4,500 years
under discussion, traits with more or less continuous time distribution
include: bifacial tools, bone tools, notched lithic tools, gravers, perforators, prismatic blades, blade cores, microliths, choppers, drills,
scrapers, and lithic heat treating. The persistence of traits over long
time periods has been noted by Lorrain (1968: Table i) for stone tools,
and by Preston (1969) for projectile points, in other areas of Texas.
The occasional finds of drilled stone pendants and incised bone on
Harris County sites has not been resolved in respect to time.
Some possible examples of burins have been found on Harris County sites, but are few in number, and without time significance. Bandi
(1969: 177) has noted that burins have only a subordinate role in

Alaskan microblade industries. It is suggested here that there is no
real need for burins in thin flake industries, as other tools are easier
to make from thin flakes that will function just as well for graving as
burins. Burin-like tools can be made very easily by simply snapping
thin lithic flakes or removing a few pressure flakes. In contrast, in
thick lithic flake industries, a burin blow is probably one of the
easiest methods of making a graving tool.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS
The major conclusions reached as a result of this research are
listed below:
1.

Sandy paste pottery was the principle type used over the entire
ceramic period, with some late use of bone tempering.
2. Late sites reveal less pottery than earlier ceramic sites.
3. Late sites are smaller, but more frequent.
4. Over the time interval considered, there was a trend toward
smaller lithic artifacts in later time.
5. Small prismatic blades were probably in use for the entire time
period of roughly 4,500 years.
6. The bow and arrow may have been in use for the entire time
period, with early use of unifacial point elements.
7. A number of artifact types do not have time-diagnostic value,
which may indicate continuity in some technology over long time
periods.
8. Taken together, the tendencies in later time to use smaller sites in
greater numbers, use smaller lithic tools, and use less pottery may
indicate a drift to a more mobile type of existence. However, these
changes could simply indicate technological changes together
with less use of specific campsites. Tom D. Dillehay (personal
communication) has suggested that a more mobile type of lifeway
may be associated with an increased ability to schedule use of a
wider variety of food resources. People would be moving more to
take advantage of greater subsistence opportunities.
