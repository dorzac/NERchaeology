ABSTRACT
In December 2015 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resource management survey for the City of Tyler, Texas of five
tracts totaling 163 hectares (402 acres) along Pilot Road west of the Lake Tyler East for
timber thinning operations. The pedestrian survey was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit #7486 in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. The visual
examination of the tracts found a well location which was surveyed as part of three
unrelated archaeological surveys in the project area and the summit of an upland ridge
was leveled in the past. Shovel testing of the project area was successful in establishing a
15 meter (50 foot) buffer for 41SM213. One secondary thinning flake was recovered and
will be curated in the Anthroplogy Laboratory at Stephen F. Austin State University.
DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to State
Archaeological Landmarks or National Register of Historic Places eligible properties and
SAL as defined by the Antiquities Code of Texas for the proposed timber thinning
provided logging equipment stays outside the buffer for 41SM213.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2015, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey for the City of Tyler, Texas of five tracts at the east
end of Pilot Road near the Lake Tyler East (Figure 1). The survey was conducted upon
request of the City of Tyler for timber thinning operations in compliance with the Texas
Antiquities Code. The project was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
under Texas Antiquities Permit #7486. All terms of the permit were carried out pursuant
of the Texas Antiquities Code.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries and place a buffer around site 41SM213.
The previous investigations, shovel testing, and landform were used to place the site
buffer around 41SM213.
survey.

No other cultural resources were documented during the

The pedestrian survey found the summit of an upland ridge was severely

impacted by ground disturbance activity in the past. One secondary flake was collected
from a shovel test near 41SM213. The flake will be curated at the Stephen F. Austin
State University Anthropology Laboratory in Nacogdoches, Texas.
The report was prepared following the short report format outlined by the Council
of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a). Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a
determination of “no effect” to cultural resources eligible to the National Register of
Historic Places or State Archaeological Landmarks for the proposed timber thinning
operations.
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed timber thinning includes removing select trees from the five tracts
totaling 163 hectares (402 acres (ac)) with heavy machinery. The tracts are on the east
and west sides of Pilot Road. No trees will be cut within 30 m (100 ft) of the lake shore.
The three tracts include a low ridge and an ancient stream terrace. The lake forms the
eastern boundary and private land with modern residences form the western and southern
boundaries. There is no obvious modern development in the project area; however,
several disturbed areas were observable on the aerial photographs and noted during the
pedestrian survey. Vegetation includes mixed hard and soft wood trees with moderate to

deadfall. Soils are include Lilbert (LtC) on the summit of the upland ridge with DelryBesner (Db) complex on the terrace (NRCS 2015). Lilbert soil series have A and E
horizons of fine sandy loam 86 cm (34 in) over a Bt horizon of sandy clay loam. Derly
series soils are in swales with 35 cm (14 in) of silt loam over clay loam interspersed with
ridges of Besner fine sandy loam 155 cm (63 in) deep over silty clay loam.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Smith County was part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The large area investigations in the area are
limited to those along Lake Fork Reservoir (e.g., Brusheth et al 1977) to the northwest
and Lake Palestine (e.g., Keith 1971) to the south. Large linear surveys were conducted
for new roads (e.g., Campbell et al. 2008). The smaller surveys were typically for road
improvements (e.g., Nelson and Perttula 2012). These investigations found, tested, and
conducted data recovery efforts on a variety of historic and prehistoric sites. Most of the
surveys mentioned above focused on low lands and areas adjacent to perennial streams
and well developed floodplains. The numerous small surveys in the area include both
upland and lowland settings. The investigations that documented archaeological sites
found that prehistoric and early historic sites were found adjacent to stream channels in
the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region.
Initially, D.A. Story and others (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) describe the prehistoric
cultures of the Gulf Coastal Plain from southwest Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. The
Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). This document includes several historic contexts, each of which deals with a
particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407)
describes the Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area
between the Red River in the north, the Trinity River in the west, and Angelina River in the
south.

3

The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200
B.C. - A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the
historic Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian
period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and
gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic
(7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200
B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing
utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens,
prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle,
and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of
northeast Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture
(A.D. 800-1600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).

Larger

aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial
areas.

Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds (Perttula

2004:379). A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level
as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also
established. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the
current cultural setting of the area and marks the expulsion of native populations and the
progression of the American immigrants as they established farms, towns, and counties.
The earliest American moved into the Neches Saline area in the late 1820’s. Smith County
was officially formed on 11 April 1846 with Tyler as the County Seat. Local farmers grew
cotton, fruit, and vegetables. Cash crops became more prevalent with the arrival of the
International-Great Northern Railroad in Whitehouse in the 1870’s. Surviving the Civil
War, the area remained rural until the East Texas oil boom. Industry, the growth of Tyler,
and the creation of Lake Tyler in the 1960’s all contributed to the growth and maintenance
of the area although, chicken, cattle, and siviculture still dominate the local economy
(Smith 2010).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities
Code following survey standards described by the Texas Historic Commission (2015)
and report guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). The purpose of these investigations
was to locate prehistoric and historic cultural resources within the project area, delineate
the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, and make a preliminary evaluation of each
site's integrity and potential for State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) designation and/or
National Register of Historic Properties (NRHP) eligibility. All fieldwork and reporting
comply with the ethics standards of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2015). The atlas contains a current
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys,
archaeological site location maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records
show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded
sites. Of immediate concern, site 41SM213 is within the project area. Shovel tests were
excavated approaching the site boundary.

Positive shovel tests, landform, and the

previous investigation results were used to refine the site boundary. A 30 m (100 ft)
buffer was flagged around the site. No logging vehicles will enter the site buffer.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area relying on
shovel testing and visual examination to locate archaeological sites within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30
centimeters (cm) square in 10 cm (4 in) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35
in). Following the THC guidelines, the pedestrian survey included a surface inspection
focused on areas with exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds) along with a
shovel tests. Shovel tests and surface feature locations were recorded with Ashtech GPS
units with sub-meter post-processing accuracy.

Notes were made about soil color,

texture, and shovel test depth. Photographs were made of the area and shovel test
profiles as needed to illustrate the variety of landforms and soils encountered during the
survey.

RESULTS
The project area includes five tracts totaling 163 ha (402 ac) on either side of Pilot
Road between modern residences on the west and south sides and the lake on the north
and east sides. Topography, surface features, vegetation, and soils are described below.
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2015) found one advocational survey and five professional archaeological survey within
1.6 kilometers (km) (1 mile (mi)) of the project area (Appendix B). The advocational
survey recorded eight sites (41SM166, 41SM167, 41SM204, 41SM205, 41SM209,
41SM211, 41SM212, 41SM213, 41SM214, and 41SM217) within one mile of the current
project area but provided no data on the sites. The professional surveys include six
surveys by AEL (Perttula and Nelson 2004, 2005a, b, c, d and e) for well locations and
two surveys by DETAC for timber thinning (Galan 2013a and b). These surveys revisited
sites 41SM209, 41SM213, and recorded 41SM346. All of these sites are prehistoric
artifact scatters on sandy rises within the floodplain (now partially submerged) or on
ridge summits adjacent to the floodplain (now on the lake shore).
Two of the surveys (Perttula and Nelson 2004 and 2005b) were conducted for
well locations within the current project area.

The 2004 survey included two well

locations (Anderson and Echard Heirs F) and an access road. The survey for the Echard
Heirs F well location revisited 41SM213 which was recorded by advocational
archaeologists as sherds recovered from the swash zone. AEL shovel testing on the
adjacent landform recorded 41SM213 as a single component Caddo occupation with
artifacts between 20-40 cmbs. Artifacts recovered from eleven shovel tests include 13
sherds and three lithic fragments on elevated landforms adjacent to the lake shore. As a
result of this archaeological survey, the Anderson location was built but the Echard Heirs
F well location was not built. The results of this survey and of the 2005b survey for the
Musselwhite Gas Unit No. 1 (not built) to the south were incorporated into the present
survey strategy for Tracts 16813 and 1607.
Tracts 16813, 1607, and 16299
Tracts 16813, 1607, and 16299 total 145 ha. (358 ac) between Pilot road and Lake
Tyler East. The northern boundary is a boat ramp and the southern boundary is a private

property line. Topographically, the tracts are on the shoulder of a wide upland ridge
separating Lake Tyler East and West. Vegetation is mixed hardwood and pine with a
light to moderate understory of various bushes and shrubs. Ground cover is leaf litter.
Soils include Derly on low ridge summits and Besner in swails in Tracts 16705 and
16813 while Tract 16299 is Lilbert near the summit of the ridge.
A total of 57 shovel tests (J1-9, R1-9, V1-25, V28-34, and V41-47) were
excavated across the tracts. Shovel testing focused on elevate landforms overlooking the
lake.

Depth ranged from 20-80 cmbs in mostly light brown sandy loam. Many of the

test were contained either wet or saturated soil below 60 cmbs despite dry weather the
previous two weeks before the survey (Figures 2 and 3).
The current archaeological investigations included a visual examination and
shovel testing. The investigations began by excavating a line of shovel tests from the
Anderson Pad (constructed), across the Echard Heirs F Pad (not constructed), and toward
41SM213. One dark gray secondary thinning flake was found in shovel test J2 on the
summit of a low ridge overlooking the lake. Tests were then excavated along the margin
of the landform to look for more artifacts and establish the site boundary. No more
artifacts were found and a line of flagging tape was hung in trees around the landform to
mark the site boundary.
Shovel testing continued south and north of the site along the ridges overlooking
the lake then westward around the Anderson well pad. Observed soils in tests on ridges
were deep light brown sandy loam. Tests were terminated at 80+ cmbs (32+ inbs) at a
weak Bt horizon. Tests in swales were shallower darker brown sandy loam which
became saturated between 40 and 60 cmbs (16 and 24 inbs). No artifacts were found in
the shovel tests or during the surface inspection except for the one flake on 41SM213.
Tracts 16428 and 1670
Tracts 1648 and 1670 totals 18 ha (45 ac) between Pilot Road and private
residence to the west, south, and north. Topographically, the tracts are on the shoulder
and summit of a wide upland ridge separating Lake Tyler East and West. Vegetation is
mixed hardwood and pine with a light to moderate understory of various bushes and
shrubs. Ground cover is leaf litter. Soils include Derly on low ridge summits and Besner

Tract 16428 was severely disturbed by excavations up to 2 m (7 ft) deep on the summit of
the ridge. Review of Goggle Earth maps show the area was cleared of trees and has
several trails in 1995.
A total of 25 shovel tests (V26-27, V35-40, and V48-64) were excavated across
the tracts. Shovel testing focused on low ridges across the tracts. Swales were either
inundated with water or soils were wet. Depth ranged from 50-80 cmbs (20-32 inbs) in
light brown sandy loam on undisturbed ridges, brown and grayish brown sandy loam in
swales, and reddish brown sandy loam in disturbed areas (Figure 2 and 4). No artifacts
were found in the shovel tests or during the surface inspection.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Tyler, Texas will conduct timber thinning on five tracts of land along
Pilot Road near Lake Tyler East. DETAC performed a cultural resources survey of the
tracts in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code under Texas Antiquities Permit
#7486. The project was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries and establish a buffer for 41SM213 to ensure
logging operations do not impact the site. The surface inspection found only one well
pad was constructed of the three surveyed in 2004 and 2005 in the project area.
Additionally, the summit of the ridge east of Pilot Road was leveled in the past. A total
of 62 shovel tests were excavated across the project area with an emphasis on several low
ridges and the area of 41SM213. Shovel test found deep light brown and reddish brown
sandy loam on the ridges and shallow dark brown sandy loam soil in the swales. One
flake was found in a shovel test on 41SM213.

The flake will be curated at the

Anthropology Laboratory at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas.
A 15 m (50 ft) buffer was placed around the site to keep logging equipment off of
41SM213.
Based on the shovel test results and the visual examination, there is little chance
of encountering any additional undiscovered cultural resources in the project area. In the
event that human remains and/or archaeological materials are discovered during timber
thinning, then the project activity will cease in the immediate area and DETAC shall be
notified of the discovery. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no
effect” to properties listed or eligible for the NRHP as defined by the National Historic
Preservation Act and State Archaeological Landmarks as defined by the Antiquities Code
of Texas provided the logging operations stay outside of the marked buffer for 41SM213.
