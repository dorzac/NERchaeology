A Lithic Tool Cache in
the Texas Panhandle

ABSTRACT
This paper reports the finding of an undisturbed cache of lithic
tools and flakes at a site on Pedrosa Creek in Potter County, Texas.
The cache contained a total of 51 chipped stone items representing a
variety of tools made of several different kinds of lithic material. The
cache may date to the time of the Antelope Creek Focus, and gives
significant information as to the implements and materials in the
possession of one individual.

INTRODUCTION
The cache was found at a site recorded as A-1107 in the files of the
Panhandle Plains Historical Museum and West Texas State University at
Canyon, Texas. The site is on the Frying Pan Ranch of the Bush Estate in
Western Potter County. It is situated on Pedrosa Creek, which runs northward into Tecovas Creek, which in turn runs northeastward into the
Canadian River.
Site A-1107 lies at the base of a sharp east-west escarpment of the
Ogallala formation which forms the northern edge of the Llano Estacado
and the southern edge of the Canadian River breaks. Springs in the
general area form near the base of the escarpment. The top of the caprock
is approximately 1,160 meters AMSL with the springs forming about 1,100
to 1,130 meters AMSL. Signs of occupation are found on both sides of
Pedrosa Creek near a spring which is active today. These indications
extend 1,000 meters downstream {north} and 500 meters east to west from
the spring. Although very little of the site is found upstream (south} from
the spring, the cache was located upstream.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
The site contains numerous darkened midden areas with burnt rock
and broken burned rocks. Flint, other lithic debris, and bone are
widespread in washes. One potsherd of Borger Cordmarked (Suhm and

nearest probable sources of this material are to the west in New Mexico.
Three mortar holes are located on the highest knoll forming the west bank
of Pedrosa Creek, and two others are found east of the creek about 30
meters from the present channel. Small corner-notched, side-notched, and
triangular arrow points have been found on the site, with the greatest
concentration near the mortar holes to the west. A fall with a large pool
forms on the creek near this spot. Archaic dart points have been reported
from this site, and a Paleo-lndian (Agate Basin) point has been found in the
creekbed not far away.

INVESTIGATION OF THE CACHE
Large flint flakes and some bone fragments were found on the surface
10-15 meters south of the cache. The lithic cache was discovered when a
portion of a large thick biface (Artifact #I) was exposed by erosion. After
the biface was uncovered with a trowel, and two additional pieces were
removed, it was surmised that the find was a cache. The remaining pieces
were removed in layers. The first two layers were neatly arranged, but the
third was more random with overlapping (Fig. 1), the fourth layer may
have been more than a single tier, with considerable overlapping of the
pieces. Layers.5 and 6 were mainly utilized flakes, with the position of
pieces very random and the order of removal uncertain. The pieces were
laid horizontally throughout, with the well worked tools near the top. The
area of the cache was approximately the size of the biface and the depth
was about I0 cm (Fig. 2). Two small bone fragments were in the cache but
were so badly deteriorated that they could not be identified. No points
were found in the cache. After all the pieces were removed, the soil was
screened for approximately one meter around the cache area, and Artifact #14 was found in the loose soil taken from the cache. The soil in the
cache was indistinguishable from the surrounding sterile soil. Darkened
soil about 30 cm to the north of the cache was also screened but was
sterile.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS
The 51 lithic artifacts found in the cache are described individually
in Table i and pictured in Figs. 3-6. Table 1 indicates the type, size, and
material of each specimen and includes remarks on some of the items.
When noted, right and left edges are as seen when looking at the flake
with the proximal end at the bottom.
Of the 51 pieces in the cache, 21 are classifiable as well-worked
tools, 5 as retouched flakes, 22 as utilized flakes, and 3 as unmodified
flakes. The 21 specimens regarded as well worked tools include I large
thick biface (#I), 1 beveled knife (#5), 1 drill (#6), 2 scrapers (#2 and 7),

2 side scrapers (#8 and 9), 6 end scrapers (#3,4,11,14,16, and 17), and 8
knives (#10,12,13,15,18-20, and 43). Artifact numbers correlate with
specimens as illustrated in Figs. 3-6. The knives are unusual being
extremely straight along one edge with little or no work on remaining
edges. These are made on very thin flakes. The five pieces listed as
retouched flakes (#22,24,26,32, and 36) show some minor flaking. The 22
items shown as utilized flakes (#21,27,31,33,35,37-42, and 44-51) show
some signs of wear damage from use, but no work beyond striking from
the core. Many of these still retain the striking platform. The remaining
3 pieces (#23,25, and 34) show no sign of either work or use.
Certain of the pieces are remarkably similar. These include 2
scrapers (#2 and 7), which are large, thin triangle unifaces; the 2 side
scrapers (#8 and 9), which are small flakes with one well-worked edge;
2 of the end scrapers (#3 and 4) which are large unifaces; 2 of the end
scrapers (#11 and 14) which are small square unifaces; 2 of the end
scrapers (#16 and 17) which are small rectangular unifaces; 3 of the
knives (#10,12, and 13) which are thin flakes with one edge well-worked
in a very straight line, and with squared corners; 2 of the knives (#15
and 19) which are thin flakes with one well-worked edge and a rounded
corner; and 2 of the knives (#20 and 43) which are small square
unifaces with fine work on one edge.
With regard to material, the vast majority (43) of the pieces are
Alibates agate, 3 are Tecovas jasper (#4,5, and 25), 2 are Edwards flint
(#9 and 14), 1 is Potter chert (#8), 1 is Dakota quartzite (#20), and 1 is
Tecovas quartzite (#3). Fourteen pieces of the Alibates agate are very
distinctive (#10,19,21,22,26,27,29,30,36,38,41,46,48, and 50) and more
than likely came from the same core. Pieces 21 and 50 can be fitted
together as struck from this core. The 3 pieces of Tecovas jasper are
similar enough to be from a single core. It is also noteworthy that the
specimens of material other than Alibates agate are all classifiable as
well-worked tools, except for the one piece of Tecovas jasper (#25).
Also, on the five retouched flakes, all work is on the right edge of the
inner face, or the left edge of the outer face.
The Alibates agate which makes up the bulk of the material in the
cache is a local material quarried approximately 65 kilometers to the
northeast on the Canadian River near Fritch, Texas (Southwest Regional
Office, National Park Service 1975). The nearest known source of the
Tecovas materials is an outcrop on Sierrita de la Cruz Creek a few
miles to the north, but the material also occurs in the Canadian River
breaks north of Amarillo, and along the eastern caprock escarpment
from the Palo Duro Canyon southward. Edwards flint occurs along the
southern part of the escarpment and southward into the Edwards
Plateau. Potter chert comes from Pliocene and Pleistocene gravel
deposits at many places in the Texas Panhandle. Dakota quartzite

CONCLUSIONS
The lithic cache was found in a buried, neatly stacked, undisturbed
condition. The cache should therefore show the variety of materials and
the range of tools in the possession of a single person at a particular
time. Although consisting largely of flakes with only slight modification
by or for the use in cutting or scraping processes, the cache also includes an interesting variety of more extensively shaped unifaces and
bifaces for chopping, cutting, scraping, and perforating. And despite the
ownerâs obvious preference for Alibates agate, an interesting range of
other materials, both local and remote, is present. Work on the finished
tools in general is excellent quality; most of the remainder of the flakes
show some signs of use or minor trimming for sharpening an edge.
Dating of the cache is difficult without point types as reference.
The wide variety of points found on the site (from Paleo-Indian through
Archaic to Neo-American) is of no assistance. However, the beveled
knife (Artifact #5) is characteristic of artifacts found in assemblages
attributable to the Antelope Creek Focus (Hughes 1962} along the
Canadian River in this part of the Texas Panhandle. Approximate
dating of this cultural unit is 1200-1450 A.D. If the beveled knife can be
used as an indicator, the cache would be about 500 to 700 years old.
