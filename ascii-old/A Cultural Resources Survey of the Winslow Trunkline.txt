Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the
11.2-mile Winslow Trunkline to be developed by Mockingbird Midstream Gas Services, L.L.C.
(Mockingbird) in western La Salle County, Texas. The project was entirely privately funded, and
the properties through which the pipeline is to be constructed are privately owned; therefore, no
Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
A pedestrian survey of the right-of-way was conducted by two archaeologists in September 2011.
The survey revealed that much of the pipeline right-of-way had been mechanically disturbed in
the recent past. The only evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural material observed along
the proposed right-of-way were three prehistoric core reduction flakes.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the installation of the pipeline be allowed to proceed
as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any additional, undiscovered
cultural resources are encountered during development, such finds should be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly four individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. David Black,
Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr. Ryan DeBarros, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, and Mr. Ronnie Glenewinkel, Environmental Coordinator at Mockingbird
Midstream. All were extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall
knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of
work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologist Belisario Silva,
who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured these
surveys were conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Introduction
Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd., requested a
cultural resources survey of the 11.2mile Winslow Trunkline right-of-way in
western La Salle County, proposed for
development by Mockingbird
Midstream Gas Services, L.L.C.
(Mockingbird), and hereinafter
occasionally referred to as the Project
Area (PA) (Figures 1 - 3). Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations
(TAAI) conducted a pedestrian survey
of the right-of-way in September 2011.

Modern
Environmental
Setting

Figure 1. Location of La Salle County and the Project
Area in Texas.

Climate
and
Vegetation
La Salle County is
located in south-central
Texas near its southern
border with Mexico (see
Figure 1). Its current
political boundary
encompasses 1,517
square miles. The
generally flat to rolling
terrain ranges in
elevation from about
600-800 feet above
mean sea level. Clayey Figure 2. Location of the PA on large topographic map.
and loamy soils support
the growth of small predominately mesquite trees, and thorny scrub brush with assorted cacti and
grassy understory.

With its semi-arid
environment, the county
is generally frost-free
from mid-February
through
early
December, allowing for
about 288 growing
season days. The
average annual rainfall is
about 22 inches, with
most rainfall occurring
in May and September.
These peaks are the
result of thunderstorms
bearing moist air from
the Gulf of Mexico to
the east, and the Pacific
Ocean much farther to
the west. La Salle
county is part of what is
known as the ‘Winter
Garden Region’ for the
vegetables grown there
(Leffler 1996).
However, rainfall
amounts
vary
significantly from year to
year, and the high
evapotranspiration

beneficial surplus of
annual rainfall. This is another reason irrigation systems are so necessary, and commonly found
in use today throughout the area. Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently
hovering above 1000F, although humidity is generally low compared to environments closer to
the Gulf Coast. Overall, the climate can be classified as subtropical steppe.

Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande are the major southeasterly trending rivers draining the
South Texas region. A subtle divide through the county causes numerous intermittent creeks to
flow south into the Nueces River, and others to drain toward the north, and into the Frio River.
Many drainages intermittently flow into both rivers during infrequent seasonal periods of
2

abundant rainfall. Although there are
many springs in La Salle County, very
few are active due primarily to the dip
of the substrate shales which carry these
subterranean seeps to the south and
east. Ancient springs that may have
existed in the area at one time have
likely succumbed to overgrazing and
irrigation pumping during modern times
(Brune 1981). During our investigation
of the project area in July 2011, we
observed no water flowing, or niche
pools.

Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South
Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation
area as defined by Gould (1975), and
the regional flora of South Texas has
been classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending
out from northeast Mexico (Figures 4 Figure 4. Physiographic regions of Texas
and 5). This is the only part of Texas (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg)
where some vegetation exhibits growth
throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map
2011). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively
recent occurrence, with a mix of woody
and grassland species providing a
savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester
1980; Inglis 1964).
The original vegetation was an open
grassland mixed with brushy chaparral.
Oaks, pecan, and ash were common
along perennial streams. Due in part to
overgrazing and the exclusion of fire,
the invasion of woody species has
changed the vegetation into “Texas
brush country” dominated by mesquite,
acacia, spiny hackberry, brazil,

whitebrush, lotebrush, and others
3

(Diamond et al. 1987:203-221). On sandy soils, the brush includes mesquite with mixed grasses.
In contrast, clay soils support mesquite (Proposis juliflora), various species of Acacia, and
mimosa, granjeno or desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera
angustifolia),lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), and species of Condalia and Castela
(Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits some of the greatest mammalian species diversity
in the state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several species of turtles,
salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50 species of fish
have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and cenizo (Leucophyllum texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana), prickly
pear (Opuntia) more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the
present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Winslow Trunkline lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by Hester
(1980, 1995, 2004; Figure 6). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due
to the compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated
within the region. Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of information that exists for
4

south Texas and as such offers
only a “general framework” for
prehistoric periods particular to
the region (Figure 6). All dates
are given as approximate years
before present (B.P.), i.e.,
before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950
B.P.)
This period is estimated at
between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in
south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward
the close of the Pleistocene.
Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include
Clovis and Folsom projectile
points. The wide distribution of
Clovis-type points across most
of North America and even into
Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the
people who made them. Other
artifacts associated with the
Clovis culture include bifaces
and prismatic blades, engraved
stones, bone and ivory points,
stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners. During the late
Paleoindian interval, the first
stemmed lanceolate points, such
as Angostura, Golondrina, St.
Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among
a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian
adaptation has been considered
to be one of small bands of
nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late
Pleistocene fauna, including
mammoth, mastodons, bison,
camel, and horse, across North

America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been placed on the wide diversity of plants
and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans, such as turtles and tortoises, alligators,
mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Collins
1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and
burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly
common in south Texas; however, no camp sites or killsites have been found south of a large
workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian
finds in south Texas have consisted of surface lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black
1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as deer, fish,
and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock
cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups
were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including most
of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low during
the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization of a
wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as
well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the
South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at
least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
6

rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1999) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during
the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented
by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this marked a
transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and
a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter
1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites
were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
7

point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and
the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending
a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near
each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).

8

Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then, is
generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

La Salle County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in La Salle County indicate that the area has been occupied for about
11,000 years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land
hospitable. Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed
rabbitskin robes, and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly
increased the deadliness of their spears (Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they
learned to make pottery and to hunt with bows and arrows. During the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, the Coahuiltecan Indians native to La Salle County were squeezed out by
other Indian who were migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from the
south. Many of the Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and
Comanches moved in to take their place (Leffler 1996).
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the La Salle
County area, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
traversed parts of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling
among the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Covey 1961). His account of
his experiences in 1533–34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether
themselves to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter, and summer,
occasionally sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many
groups would live near each other in the semiarid environs of south Texas to harvest prickly pear
pads and other succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–37).
By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico with
thousands of cattle, and using Native Americans as slave labor. This encroachment by the Spanish
9

forced Native American groups from northern Mexico to flee into south Texas. Beginning in the
late 1600s, however, Spaniards passed through the area on the Old San Antonio Road, a camino
real, to and from other Spanish settlements in Texas. In the 1700s and 1800s, there are
documented accounts of Spanish entradas passing through the area, but none have been noted
to establish any sort of permanent bases in present-day La Salle County (Chipman 1992)
After the Mexican War of Independence the Mexican government used land grants to encourage
its citizens to settle in Texas. Perhaps as many as seven grants were made between 1832 and 1834
that included territory now in La Salle County. None of the recipients seem to have made use of
the land, however. By 1836, when Texas became independent from Mexico, the area remained
populated almost solely by Indians (Leffler 1996).
Between the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War (1836–46), most of La Salle County lay in
the disputed area between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River, and it became a haven for
desperate characters until about 1865. New settlers who lived in jacals or dugouts were
frequently being harrassed by hostile Indians and outlaws. Due in part to being pursued by the
Texas Rangers, and being decimated by disease, the Indians were forced to leave La Salle County
by 1877. By 1880, cattle ranching was firmly established, and although sheep ranching was also
an important part of the economy at the time, by 1900 extended droughts and an increase in
predators combined to make sheep ranching a tough and dwindling business (Leffler 1996).
As with rest of the nation, during the Great Depression many of the county’s farmers were forced
to cut back their once-lucrative vegetable production, and they fell back on raising poultry, hogs,
and dairy cattle (Leffler 1996). The discovery of large oil and gas fields in the county in the 1950s
certainly bolstered La Salle County’s economy, and although large ranches lay claim to most of
the land in the county, the production of oil and gas are very much a progressively increasing part
of the county’s development (Leffler 1996).

Site Types That Could be Expected Along the Right-of-Way
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in La Salle County are prehistoric open campsites
ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure 6). Some of
these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped
for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of
people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these
same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these
large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing
multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from
making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from
terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells.
Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine
10

environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands
away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, and cacti offered a
different food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly
pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze
on the northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone
tools (Dillehey 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients
that can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that could be expected
within the PA. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that were
left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The general
absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites
suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time ( However,
small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more
knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings
or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples
of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes
removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality
of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’
the cobble to judge whether it was usable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the
cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of
poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away
from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the
thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic
scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles
flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further
reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry
blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to
areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry
blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
11

today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in La Salle County have been
documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but
differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at
times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were
not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types
of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not
present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up
gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone
remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as
well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Although a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded in south
Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no documented burned rock middens in La Salle County. Burned rock middens result
from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like modern-day roasting
pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks that serve
as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal source,
they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is dug
near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ firecracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the
formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in south
Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both
upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric cemetery
found in proximity to the PA is 41LK28, in Live Oak County.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of
permanent structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992). The area was generally
not considered safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers
then began establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler 1996).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
12

abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects. In general, the area has been historically used predominantly as ranchland
pasture, with no development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock
tanks, corrals, and sparsely scattered outbuildings. site of significance from the 1500s through the
mid-1900s along the line were minimal.

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review

The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
La Salle County
Very few, and sparsely scattered archaeological surveys have been conducted in La Salle County.
There are only 99 archaeological sites recorded within the county, and a large number of those
were found on pipeline surveys. Nevertheless, the time-diagnostic artifacts discovered in La Salle
County provide evidence that the landscape was occupied as early as 11,000 years before the
present.

13

The site types are as varied as the landscape. Large open campsites with numerous hearths, or
campfires, a wide assortment of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered animal
remains are most commonly located along stream or river terraces. Where gravels outcrop, either
along eroded streambeds, or on higher terrain where more ancient gravels are sometimes exposed
in isolated pockets, one can expect stone chipping stations, or prehistoric quarries (Atlas 2011).
Of the 99 sites, 54 are prehistoric open campsites, and 45 are prehistoric lithic scatters. The more
significant and deeply buried open campsites with archaeological research potential lie close to
streams. Historic components on these same prehistoric sites include historic windmills and areas
of scattered glass and ceramic sherds, or in some cases there are large trash dumps. One unique
historic site is Fort Ewell (41LS19), an adobe structure located on the old Laredo to San Antonio
Road, and that served the U.S. Army from 1852-1854. The only State Archaeological Landmark
(SAL) recorded in La Salle County is the County Courthouse in Cotulla (Leffler 1996; Atlas
2011).
Finally, one of the more potentially significant archaeological sites in the south Texas
archaeological region is located in La Salle County; this being the Oulline Site (41LS3). The
Oulline Site covers approximately 40 acres, and is located about eight miles north of Cotulla.
Diagnostic artifacts recovered from this large open campsite range in age from the Paleoindian
through the Late Prehistoric periods, and demonstrate the potential for other significant
archaeological sites to exist in the area (Hester et al. 1969).
Surveys and Sites within One Mile of the Current Project Area
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archeological sites indicated that
no professional archaeological surveys had been conducted within one mile, and there were no
known archaeological sites within one mile of the proposed Project Area. However, as shown in
Figure 3, TAAI has conducted a survey of the Leona East Trunkline in February 2011. The only
potential sites within one mile of the Winslow Trunkline may have existed adjacent to IH-35, the
historic area known as Tuna Siding. However, that area was bored under, and any historic
structures or artifacts that may have existed in that area were not be disturbed by construction
(Nickels 2011).

Historic Site Potential
A standard source of review is the extensive collection of online maps and aerial photographs
available at the Perry Casteñada Library at the University of Texas at Austin (Perry Casteñeda
Library 2011). Although this source would normally prove invaluable for researching the
possibility of, and potential for, historic sites and structures to exist within one mile of a project
area, in this case the PA is in such a rural area that no old maps or aerial photographs were
available.
A second standard research source consulted for old maps and aerial photographs was a very
comprehensive and large compilation of old maps and aerial photographs compiled by the Texas
Department of Transportation from dozens of historic archives throughout the state of Texas.
14

Once again, the Winslow Trunkline appears to be in a rural area of La Salle County that either
warranted little attention, or the area was void of historic structures.
In general, the area has apparently been historically used as ranchland pasture, with no
development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock tanks, corrals, and
sparsely scattered outbuildings. As such, no maps or aerial photographs dating before 1982 were
found in the usual reliable online databases. In sum, there may be rare and isolated occurrences of
early ranching activities along the pipelines, but the probability of encountering any archaeological
site of significance from the 1500s through the mid-1900s on the line is unlikely.
Nevertheless, the lack of comprehensive historic map and aerial information, coupled with the
paucity of cultural resources surveys within the area is possibly, and perhaps probably, why no
information is available regarding the presence of historic structures, ranching or industrial
activities, or persons of historic significance to the immediate area. Technically, any structures old
than 45 years are now considered of interest by the Texas Historical Commission, and this should
be considered when the Project Area is developed. Historic sites recorded in La Salle County
consist of local family cemeteries
with just a few burials in each,
house sites and farmsteads from
as early as the 1850s, and trash
scatters.

Soils
As illustrated in Figures 7-9,
there are 14 soil types that will be
dissected by construction of the
Winslow Trunkline. These soils
types are consistent with the
varying terrain in the western
portion of La Salle County, and
as such, the potential for buried
and intact cultural resources
varies with the terrain and soils
(Gabriel et al. 1994; Web Soil
Survey 2011). Table 1 provides a
brief description of the soil types,
and their potential for buried
deposits, and thereby implying
their potential prehistoric
significance.

The soils within the PA suggest from minimal to high probabilities for buried and intact
archaeological deposits to exist, and although it is unlikely that significant sites are extant in the
upland areas, soils along streams are more likely to contain intact archaeological deposits.

Field Survey Goals, Methodology, and Levels of Effort
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey. The topics addressed were site type, distribution, density,
size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is structured around patterns of
settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Two archaeologists
conducted a general
survey of the pipeline,
meandering back and
forth across the 100foot wide right-of-way.
Surface visibility ranged
from 90 to 100 percent
(see for example, Figure
10). All cutbanks, and
rodent and mammal
backdirt piles along the
ri gh t -o f-way were
thoroughly examined. In
accordance with a
general “no collection”
policy, cultural material
of a redundant nature,
both prehistoric and Figure 10. Shovel testing at Los Raices Creek crossing; facing north.
19

historic, were not to be
collected. Instead, they
w ere t o be ful l y
documented via sketches,
field photographs, and
copious notes.
Exceptions were to be
made for diagnostic
artifacts, particularly
those artifacts which
could be considered as
significant to the
interpretation of Texas
prehistory, such as Early
Archaic-Paleoindian
transitional, or
Paleoindian diagnostics.

Figure 11. Cutbank at Las Raices Creek crossing; facing northwest.

These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal
Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic
occurrences adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in this
report of investigations. A total of 45 shovel tests were dug in 20-cm levels, and all sediments
were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts
recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of
the backfilled shovel test. The results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test
forms, are on file at the Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations office in Martindale, Texas,
and may be made available upon request.

Results of the Field Investigations
An inspection of the surface along the right-of-way revealed predominately eroded, deflated, and
mechanically disturbed surfaces. Two areas that suggested a moderate to high probability for
terrace deposits and possibly buried and intact cultural deposits to exist were along the Las Raices
Creek crossing and one of its first order tributaries. These areas were shovel tested, with negative
results (Figure 12). The only evidence of cultural material along the trunkline consisted of three
interior flakes widely scattered across an eroded slope, with thin soils and ironstone fragments.
They were core reduction flakes made from tan, non-heat treated, fine-grained chert. These were
designated as Isolated Find 1 (see Figure 12).

20

21

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A survey conducted by two archaeologists in September 2011 revealed that much of both rightof-ways had in the recent past been mechanically disturbed, and other than isolated three core
reduction flakes, no evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural material was observed. As
such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the development of theWinslow Trunkline as currently
planned be allowed to proceed. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any
undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development of the pipeline , such finds
should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant.
