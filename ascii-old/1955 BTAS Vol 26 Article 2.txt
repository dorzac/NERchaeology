LITTLE SUNDAY: AN ARCHAIC SITE
IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE
JACK

T.

HUGHES

As recently pointed out by Suhm, Krieger and Jelks in
their Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology (1954, p.
63), practically nothing is known about the Archaic Stage
in the Texas Panhandle, and "The definition of cultural remains in this gap is an important future problem for Texas
archeology." Their statement that "no sites have yet been
located where a definite complex can be defined" (p. 66)
is not strictly accurate, for the archeological survey conducted by the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum since
1952 has revealed a great many Archaic sites in the Panhandle. However, it is true that no reports had been published on these sites up to that time. The purpose of this
article is to help remedy this situation (see also: Tunnell
and Hughes, 1955).
Although none of the Archaic sites located by the Museum
has been excavated, and few of them have been tested, surface examinations at several have produced significant results. Considering this fact, and the urgent need for data
on the Archaic Stage in the Panhandle, it seems worthwhile
to report initial work at one of these sites, pending future
excavation. For this purpose one of the richest and purest
localities so far discovered, the Little Sunday site (designated A160 in the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
records), has been chosen.
Archaic sites in the Panhandle are of several different
kinds, and have produced a wide variety of remains. This
diversity is readily understood when it is realized that the
Archaic Stage was several thousand years long-enough
time for much cultural change even at the slow rate of
simple cultures. It should be kept in mind, therefore, that
the Little Sunday site is not necessarily typical of all sites
throughout the Panhandle during the entire Archaic Stage.
The complex represented at the Little Sunday site is yet
to be fully defined culturally, geographically, and chronologically; there are other Archaic complexes in the Pan-

handle whose definition has not yet begun; and probably
there are others whose existence is not yet even suspected.

The Region
The Little Sunday site is on the Edd Reynolds ranch in
eastern Randall County, Texas. It is on the northwest rim
of Little Sunday Canyon, which drains northeastward into
Palo Duro Canyon. Palo Duro Canyon, which drains southeastward, has been cut into the eastern Caprock Escarpment
of the Staked Plains by the Prairie Dog Town Fork of Red
River. Little Sunday Creek joins the Prairie Dog Town
Fork within the boundaries of Palo Duro State Park, and
on the southeast side of Little Sunday Canyon, the Lighthouse, a prominent erosional feature familiar to many park
visitors, is visible to the east from the Little Sunday site.
The Staked Plains are a high piedmont sloping eastward
from the Rockies, bounded on the north by the breaks of
the South Canadian River, on the east by a tall jagged
escarpment eroded by the headwaters of the Red, Brazos,
and Colorado rivers, and on the west by the valley of the
Pecos River. To the south the Staked Plains merge with the
Edwards Plateau. In the vicinity of the Little Sunday site
the Caprock Escarpment has an elevation of about 3400
feet, and the Prairie Dog Town Fork and its tributaries
have cut through several hundred feet of the nearly horizontal sedimentary formations which underlie the present
surface of the Staked Plains: Pleistocene loesses at the
top; light-colored caliches and sands of the Ogallala formation (Pliocene); massive Trujillo sandstones and colorful Tecovas shales of the Dockum series (Upper Triassic);
and red beds of the Quartermaster formation (Uppermost
Permian) at the bottom.
Climatically, this is a land of extremes, with a temperature that rises and falls rapidly over a wide diurnal and
annual range. Both heat and cold, however, are greatly
ameliorated by the aridity, so that the weather is pleasant
most of the time. Winds blow continually during most of

the year, prevailingly from the southwest. Cold "northers"
strike suddenly in winter, but do not last long.
The Staked Plains are a broad, level expanse of grassland
interrupted occasionally by narrow, winding strips of woodland reaching westward up the rare stream courses. Near
the Little Sunday site mesquites border the canyons, and
prominent among the profusion of trees and other vegetation within the canyons are junipers and cottonwoods. Until
recently, bison and antelope on the plains and deer in the
breaks were the principal game animals of the region. Migratory waterfowl are important among the game birds of
the Staked Plains, since the region with its countless playa
lakes is a major flyway.

The Site
The Little Sunday site was discovered on October 5,
1954, by University of California vertebrate paleontologist

Dr. Don E. Savage and a party of students prospecting for
fossils. Dr. Savage took me to the site on the afternoon of
its discovery and I returned to it later that afternoon with
another student group. A few days later, on October 10, I
visited the site again with my family. Considering the
abundance of artifacts on the surface around the site, its
inconspicuous position, and its inaccessibility, I doubt that
it had been searched before its discovery by Dr. Savage.
The site lies near the bottom of an eroded slope which
stretches down from a flat interfluvial divide on the north
to the sharp rim of Little Sunday Canyon on the south.
It is a relatively small, roughly triangular patch of soil
stabilized by sod, an erosional island surrounded by washes
and sloping eastward, contrary to the general southward
drainage around it. The cultural remains are buried in the
soil, which lies on an erosional surface of similar eastward
slope. It is evident that local topography has undergone
considerable change since this surface was formed. That
some of this change has taken place since the site was established on this surface, and is still taking place, is shown by
the thickness of the cultural zone exposed at the heads of

58

Texas Archeological Society

the steep washes along the high west and south sides of
the erosional island, and by the amount of camp debris in
the washes-signs that much of the site has been removed
along these sides and is still being removed.
The features that made this particular place attractive as
a camp site are not readily apparent. The nearest water
today consists of springs in the canyon below and playas
on the flat above, although it is possible that some more
convenient supply existed at the time the site was occupied.
The washes which surround the site reveal that what is
left of the occupational zone rests on the fairly even, eastward sloping, erosional surface of a compact, highly calcareous, reddish sand which outcrops as bedrock at this
level along the slope above the canyon rim. The cultural
materials are contained in a relatively soft, humus darkened,
brownish sand which reaches a thickness of more than 2
feet along the steeply washed south and west edges of the
erosional island, and pinches out to the east. This deposit
is covered with grass, in contrast with the denuded slopes
around it.
Along the west and south edges of this deposit, where it
is well exposed, flint chips, fire-darkened hearth rocks, and
heat-cracked pebbles (probably used for "stone boiling"
cooking) are visible from top to bottom of its outcrop, and
are especially numerous in the lower part. The adjoining
washes are littered with similar remains. Rock hearths of
undetermined size and shape, accompanied by pieces of
charcoal and bison bone, are being uncovered by erosion at
a few places in the deposit. Future excavation of these
features promises to add much to present knowledge of the
cultural content of the archeological complex responsible
for the site, and to provide materials for radiocarbon dating.
It remains to be determined to what extent the deposit
enclosing the camp debris consists of reworked local sand
washed onto the site from its formerly higher surroundings,
or of wind-blown sand like that found at places on the interfluvial divide above the site.

The Artifacts
Surface collecting to date has produced 160 artifacts.
Although some of these were taken out of the occupational
level, most were picked up in the surrounding washes. Except for two specimens of shell, all artifacts are of stone.
Of the 158 stone artifacts, 146 are chipped implements
and 12 are grinding tools.
Most (107) of the 146 chipped stone artifacts are composed of local materials, 35 are from more distant sources,
and four are of uncertain origin. The local materials are Tecovas jasper (73 specimens), a bright-colored, ledge-forming rock in Triassic outcrops of the eastern Caprock Escarpment; Ogallala chert (32) , a drab, grainy stone occurring
in basal gravels of local Pliocene beds; and silicified wood
(2) , obtainable from nearby sources. The foreign materials
are the well-known Ali bates flint (20), a silicified dolomite
of Permian age from quarries in the Canadian River valley
north of Amarillo; the fine gray flint from Cretaceous formations in Central Texas (12) , which will be referred to
here as Edwards flint ; and Dakota quartzite (3) , a pastelcolored metamorphosed sandstone of Cretaceous age outcropping along the western Caprock Escarpment in New
Mexico. Although the materials of a few specimens may
have been mistakenly identified, I believe the identifications
are essentially correct. If they are reliable, they indicate a
group of people depending mainly on local sources, hence
probably residents of the area rather than travelers through
it, but having some direct or indirect connections to the
north, southeast, and west, in that order of importance. A
more thorough study of flint sources in this and adjoining
areas would yield valuable information.
Seventy-nine of the chipped stone artifacts are unifacially
flaked , 67 are bifacially flaked.
The 79 unifaces are of three main kinds: 72 scrapers, five
gravers, and two gouges. Thirty-nine are Tecovas jasper,
17 Alibates flint, 14 Ogallala chert, seven Edwards flint , one
Dakota quartzite, and one moss agate.

60

Texas Archeological Society

The 72 scrapers are of six kinds : 30 end scrapers, 19 side
scrapers, eight flake scrapers, seven concave scrapers, five
disc scrapers, and three core scrapers. Thirty-six are Tecovas jasper, 15 Alibates flint, 12 Ogallala chert, seven Edwards flint , one Dakota quartzite, and one moss agate.
End scrapers (30; Pl. 9, a-e). These are flakes with the
dorsal face retouched across one end to form a rounded bit.
Sixteen are complete, seven are bit fragments , and seven
are butt fragments. The bit normally is at the opposite end
of the flake from the striking platform. Rather thin, slightly
elongated flakes usually were selected, but no particular
form was preferred, and shaping was confined to the bit,
although a few specimens have some retouching along one
or both edges. As a result, most of the end scrapers are
irregular in outline; only a few have the triangular outline
often shown by such artifacts. The few triangular specimens tend to have steeper bits than the others, most of
which have unusually low-angle bits. Thick-bitted and
keel-backed forms are not present. Signs of hafting, such
as constricted or smoothed edges, are lacking. The bits of
a few specimens show slight wear. The end scrapers range
in size from 29 x 24 x 27 to 64 x 42 x 10 mm.; most fall near
the middle of this range. Twelve are Tecovas jasper, nine
Alibates flint, six Edwards flint, and three Ogallala chert.
A voidance of coarse-textured stone for end scrapers is notable, and this may help explain the unusually high proportions of Alibates and Edwards flint in this artifact class.
Side scrapers (19; Pl. 9, f, g). These are flakes with the
dorsal face retouched along one side to form a scraping
edge. They are even less formalized and more variable
than the end scrapers. A few specimens are incomplete.
As a rule, the side scrapers are smaller and thicker than
normal for this type of artifact, with a steeper bit. A few
are thin, long, and narrow, but most are thick, short, and
broad. Outline is irregular ; any shaping is confined to the
scraping edge, which is usually convex but may be straight
or rounded. The scraping edges of a few specimens are
slightly worn. Size is from 37 x 28 x 8 to 73 x 63 x 17 mm.

Eleven are Tecovas jasper, five Ogallala chert, one Alibates
flint, one Edwards flint , and one moss agate. Dominance
of local materials for these comparatively amorphous side
scrapers is notable.
Flake scrapers (8) . These are small, unshaped flakes with
one edge partly retouched. Some may be fragments of end
or side scrapers. The retouching of a few may have resulted
from use. Six are Tecovas jasper, one Ogallala chert, and
one Alibates flint.
Concave scrapers (7; Pl. 9, h, i). These are small, unshaped flakes with a retouched concavity on one edge. The
widths and depths of the concavities show considerable
variation. Four are Tecovas jasper, two Alibates flint, and
one Dakota quartzite.
Disc scrapers (5; Pl. 9, j, k). These are circular to oval in
outline and plano-convex in cross section, shaped all or most
of the way around by chipping of the dorsal face. Size range
is limited: the smallest is 30 mm. across and 6 mm. thick;
the largest 42 x 12 mm. Three are Tecovas jasper, two
Alibates flint.
Core scrapers (3; Pl. 9, o, p) . These are fist-sized pebbles
with a flat face used as a striking platform for producing a
rounded scraping edge by percussion flaking. The flat face
is a natural fracture surface on two specimens, artificial on
one. Size ranges from 77 x 63 x 30 to 98 x 70 x 47 mm. All
are Ogallala chert.
Gravers (5; Pl. 9, l). These are small, thin, irregular
flakes with a more or less prominent, beak-like point produced by various degrees of retouching along one or both
edges. In most cases the points bear tiny flake scars possibly resulting from use. The gravers are much alike in
size; a typical specimen measures 41 x 24 x 8 mm. Three
are Tecovas jasper, two Alibates flint.
Gouges (2; Pl. 9, m). These are examples of the wellknown "Clear Fork gouge." With their flat ventral surface,
keeled dorsal surface, beveled bit, sharp corners, and straight

64

Texas Archeological Society

edges, they tend to be trapezoidal in both cross section and
outline, and sometimes are referred to appropriately as
"trapezoidal scrapers." They may have been used as chisels
or adzes as well as scrapers or gouges. Their general form
indicates hafting, and this inference is sometimes strengthened by the ground or worn appearance of their lateral
edges. The two specimens from the Little Sunday site, however, are not smoothed along the lateral edges, and do not
show the use-polish sometimes seen on the bit. They are
of similar size, 57 x 36 x 18 and 60 x 44 x 20 mm. Both are
Ogallala chert.
The 67 bifaces are of five kinds: 23 projectile points, 21
knives, 10 blades, eight choppers, and five drills. Thirtyfour are Tecovas jasper, 18 Ogallala chert, five Edwards
flint, three Alibates flint, three unidentified materials, two
Dakota quartzite, and two silicified wood. Alibates flint is
notably scarcer among the bifaces than among the unifaces.
The 23 projectile points are of six kinds: nine Ellis, seven
Refugio, three unidentifiable fragments, two Palmillas, one
Lange, and one Folsom point. Fourteen are Tecovas jasper,
four Edwards flint, two Alibates flint, one Ogallala chert,
one silicified wood, and one is unidentified material. All
are heavy enough to be considered dart points. Twelve of
the classifiable specimens are stemmed (Ellis, Palmillas,
and Lange points), eight are stemless (Refugio and Folsom
points). Only the Folsom point has ground edges. Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks estimate the ages of these point types,
except Folsom, at 4000 B.C. to 1000 A.D., and assign them
to various complexes of the Archaic Stage in Texas. The
Folsom type "had given way to other types by approximately 7000 B. C." (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, p. 426) and is assigned to the Paleo-American Stage.

Ellis points (9; Pl. 10, a-f) . Nine projectile points compare more closely with Ellis points than with any other
types described by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks. Although
more of them have the slightly concave bases of Lange
points (p. 436, Pl. 97) than the convex bases of Ellis points

Little Sunday: An Archaic Site in the Texas Panhandle

65

(pp. 420 and 422, Pl. 89), all of them fall below the size
range given for Lange points and within that for Ellis
points. All of the specimens are somewhat damaged, two
being merely shoulder fragments and one only a stem fragment. The smallest, probably resharpened, is 24 x 20 x 5
mm.; the largest, 44 x 29 x 5 mm. Minimum neck width,
possibly indicative of foreshaft diameter, ranges from 12
to 15 mm. Five are Tecovas jasper, three are Edwards flint
showing some patination, and one is silicified wood. The
cultural affiliations of Ellis points are described as "Widely
distributed in Archaic Stage, more or less throughout Texas
except for Southwest section and probably the upper Panhandle. Never numerous in any particular area but may
be of greatest relative frequency in East Texas Aspect"
(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, pp. 420, 422). Their age is estimated as "1000 B.C. or earlier to 500 or 1000 A.D."
Refugio points (7; Pl. 10, g-m). Seven projectile points
fall within the Refugio type as defined by Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks (p. 474, Pl. 117), except that all are below the
minimum size. If this situation is found repeatedly in this
and adjoining areas, it may become advisable to modify
the definition of Refugio points by lowering the minimum
size to include smaller specimens, or to establish a separate
type for them. Three are complete, two are tipless, and two
are basal fragments. Workmanship tends to be somewhat
cruder than that of the stemmed points. Some of the Refugio
points may be small knives or blanks rather than projectile
points, but most are too narrow to be blanks. Size varies
little ; the smallest measurable specimen is 45 x 18 x 5 mm.,
the largest 51 x 22 x 8 mm. The former specimen, composed
of an unidentified, translucent, speckled, light gray flint,
is somewhat aberrant in having slight notches at the basal
corners (Pl. 10, m) . Of the remaining specimens, five are
Tecovas jasper , one Alibates flint . Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks
(p. 474) give the cultural affiliations of Refugio points as
"A minor type in various Archaic complexes," and the
estimated age as "Possibly 2000 B.C. to 1000 A.D."

66

Texas Archeological Society

Unclassifiable projectile point fragments (3) . These tip
fragments are small enough to suggest projectile points
rather than knives, and wide enough to suggest one or
more of the stemmed types rather than the stemless Refugio
type. Two are Tecovas jasper and one is Edwards flint.
Palmillas points (2 ; Pl. 10, n). Two projectile points correspond in all features to Palmillas points as described by
Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (p. 462, Pl. 110) . One tipless specimen of Tecovas jasper is 50 x 22 x 8 mm.; a larger, complete
specimen of similar material disappeared from the collection before it could be measured or photographed. Cultural
affiliations and estimated age of Palmillas points are given
(ibid.) as "A minor type in most complexes of Archaic
Stage in various parts of Texas" and "Probably within the
Christian era."
Lange point (1; Pl. 10, o). A single badly damaged projectile point of Ogallala chert compares favorably in all
respects with Lange points as defined by Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks (p. 436, Pl. 97). Although the original length
and width of this specimen cannot be accurately estimated,
it is considerably larger than the Ellis points. Cultural
affiliations and estimated age of Lange points are given
(ibid.) as "Primarily Edwards Plateau Aspect, extending
into East Texas Aspect, Aransas Focus on coast, and towards
plains below Panhandle" and "About 4000 B.C. to 1000 A.D.
or greater part thereof."
Folsom point (1) . The forward half of a Folsom point,
made of Alibates flint and fluted on both faces nearly t o
the tip, was found at the Little Sunday site. Grinding of
the lateral edges extends slightly past the break. The fragment is 20 mm. wide and 4 mm. thick; its original length
cannot be accurately determined. If Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks are correct in estimating that Folsom points disappeared about 7000 B.C. and that Lange points appeared
about 4000 B.C., then these artifacts are separated b y a gap
in time of about 3000 years, and it must be concluded either
that this camp site was known to Paleo-American as well

as Archaic people, or-more probably-that the Folsom
point was picked up elsewhere and brought into camp by
the makers of the Archaic points. The possibility remains,
however, that the age estimates are inaccurate, and that
there is an overlap in time between Paleo-American and
Archaic points such as the Folsom and Lange types. This
possibility receives some support from the frequent association of various Paleo-American and Archaic point types
on camp sites of the Panhandle and elsewhere, and poses
an important problem to be investigated, as Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks point out on pp. 104-106.
Twenty-one biface artifacts of simple outline, distinguished from stemless projectile points by wideness and greater
size, and from blades by thinness and better flaking, are
classified as knives. Some of these artifacts may be blanks,
especially the small specimens. The knives are of three
kinds: 18 unclassifiable fragments, two triangular, and one
lanceolate. The high proportion of fragmentary specimens
suggests either hard use of finished artifacts for cutting
purposes or accidental breakage of unfinished artifacts in
the manufacturing process. Nine are Tecovas jasper, seven
Ogallala chert, two Dakota quartzite, one Alibates flint,
one Edwards flint, and one silicified wood. The high proportion of coarser materials among these larger artifacts
is noteworthy.

Unclassifiable knife fragments (18). Eight of these are
corners, seven are tips, two are midsections, and one is an
edge fragment. They suggest a wide size range for the
original artifacts. The corner fragments are square to rounded, indicating triangular to oval outlines. Eight are Tecovas
jasper, five Ogallala chert, two Dakota quartzite, one Alibates flint, one Edwards flint, and one silicified wood.
Triangular knives (2; Pl. 10, p, q). These have straight
bases, square corners, and convex edges. The smaller specimen is complete, Tecovas jasper, and 47 x 32 x 9 mm.; the
larger is a base fragment , Ogallala chert, and ? x 47 x 7

mm.

Lanceolate knife (1). This tipless specimen has roughly
parallel edges and a convex base. It is Ogallala chert, ? x 31
x 9 mm.
Blades (10; Pl. 10, r-t). These biface artifacts are round
to triangular in outline, thick and crudely flaked. Some
may be blanks or rejects. Six are complete and four are
base, corner, or edge fragments. The smallest measurable
specimen is 42 x 42 x 21 mm., the largest 85 x 60 x 22 mm.
The less complete specimens indicate original artifacts falling within this size range. Seven are Tecovas jasper, two
Ogallala chert, and one (the largest and best made blade,
Pl. 10, r) is greenish-gray phyllite or slate of uncertain
origin.
Choppers and hammers (8; Pl. 10, v, w). These fist-sized
pebbles show chipping and battering around part or all
of their circumference. All are the tough Ogallala chert,
which was readily available in smooth chunks of convenient
size and shape for choppers and hammers. The chipping of
most was intentional; in a few it may have resulted from
use. One or two of the heaviest specimens show extensive
battering without significant chipping.
Drills include two key-shaped specimens, two unclassifiable fragments, and one reworked from a knife. All are
Tecovas jasper except one of unidentified material.

Key-shaped drills (2; Pl. 10, u). These are similar in shape
and size, with expanded, rounded bases 24 and 25 mm. wide,
respectively. Their original lengths cannot be estimated.
Unclassifiable drill fragments (2). A tip fragment of a
large drill measures 44 x 14 x 8 mm. A midsection of a still
larger drill measures 21 x 15 x 9 mm. The latter specimen
is burned so that the material is indeterminate.
Reworked knife drill (1). This is a badly broken specimen
of what appears to have been a knife reworked into a drill;
it is a midsection, with both drill tip and knife base missing.
The knife was 34 mm. wide and 7 mm. thick.

of grinding implements, seven reprepresent milling stones. All except
a micaceous, fine-grained, gray to
nearby outcrops of the Trujillo forA few show some lime encrustation.

Manos (7). Three of these are halves, two are edge fragments, and two are central fragments. The halves indicate
manos of sub-rectangular outline with partly shaped edges.
One half fragment has both faces worn and pecked-one
flat, the other transversely convex. It is 100 mm. wide and
41 mm. thick, with maximum thickness along one side. A
second half fragment has one face worn flat, the other
slightly worn and transversely convex. It is 100 mm. wide
and 29 mm. thick, again with maximum thickness along one
side. A third half fragment has one face worn flat, the other
unworked. It is 102 mm. wide and 43 mm. thick; this time
with maximum thickness down the middle. The uniformity
of width among these three mana halves is worth noting.
The two edge fragments show shaped edges. One edge
fragment 24 mm. thick has one face worn flat and pecked,
the other unworked. A second edge fragment 26 mm. thick
has one face worn flat, the other unworked. One central
fragment is 23 mm. thick with one face worn flat, the other
unworked; a second central fragment, hardly more than a
chip, is composed of local quartzite and retains part of one
worn flat face.
Milling stones (5). Three of these are central fragments
and two are edge fragments. The largest central fragment ,
27 mm. thick, has one worn and pecked slightly concave
face; the other is unworked. The other two central fragments are quite thin, evidently as a result of splitting; one
has a worn flat face, and the other has a worn slightly
concave face. Both of the edge fragments show edges pecked
into shape. The larger edge fragment has one worn and
pecked concave face, the other unworked. It is large enough
to indicate an oval basin some 10 mm. deep and 130 mm.
wide. The maximum thickness of 35 mm. occurs near the
edge. The milling surface is sooty. The smaller edge frag-

ment has one worn and pecked slightly concave face, t he
other unworked. It has a maximum thickness, also near the
edge, of 30 mm .

Shell pendant fragments (2 ; Pl. 9, n). These pieces of
worked conch shell evidently represent a single large pendant, although they do not match. The larger fragment retains part of an inner hole as well as the outer edge. If th e
pendant had a central perforation and a circular outline,
as indicated by approximately parallel arcs of hole and
edge, it may have had a diameter of about 90 mm. The
smaller fragment retains only part of the outer edge. Both
pieces are smooth and plain.
CONCLUSIONS
Surface examinations of the Little Sunday site have produced sufficient data and artifacts to make possible a start
at defining the archeological complex represented at the
site. Except for the fact that similar features have been
observed and similar artifacts collected at many comparable
localities along the eastern Caprock Escarpment, nothing
is known as yet about the geographic distribution of the
complex. What is now known of the cultural content, cultural affiliations, and chronological position of the complex
may be summarized as follows:
The making of open camps on canyon rims, and the use
of hearth rocks and pebbles for "stone boiling," are shown
by the position of the site and the kinds of features observed.
The shapes and sizes of the fireplaces remain to be determined by excavation. Nothing is yet known about structures,
if any, or burials. An emphasis on hunting supplemented
by gathering is indicated by the abundance of dart points,
hide scrapers, and choppers, accompanied by milling stones.
The Twilla bison kill in the southeastern part of the Panhandle may represent this or a similar Archaic complex
(Tunnell and Hughes, 1955) . Among artifact types which,
t aken together and with the above traits, might be expected
to have some diagnostic value in identifying the complex
when it is found elsewher e, the following are especially

noteworthy: dominance of Ellis and Refugio points, accompanied by other Archaic point types in minor amounts,
and perhaps rarely by Paleo-American point types; plain
knives represented by numerous fragments; many crude
blades and heavy choppers; some key-shaped drills; abundant end scrapers, usually large, thin, and unworked except
across the rounded bit; many side scrapers, usually small,
thick, and unworked except along the scraping edge; some
concave scrapers; a few disc scrapers and gravers; occasional heavy core scrapers and Clear Fork gouges; a number
of milling stones with oval basins and edges shaped by
pecking; and manos of sub-rectangular outline.
That the inhabitants of the Little Sunday site were residents of the region is shown by the preponderance of local
materials used for these artifacts. Materials of some chippedstone artifacts imported from the north, southeast, and west,
however, indicate some roaming or trading in those directions, and fragments of conch shell indicate some remote,
though probably indirect connections with the Gulf coast.
Certain of the artifacts, such as dart-point types and Clear
Fork gouges, suggest southeasterly connections, although
in a general way the complex also resembles the few others
of comparable age that have been defined in the Plains to
the north and the Rockies to the west.
The indications of age provided by the physical features
of the site are supported by the general character of its
cultural remains, in particular by the dart-point types and
the Clear Fork gouges, whose antiquity has been recognized.
Ages of the two dominant point forms have been estimated
from 2000 B.C. to 1000 A.D., and it may be assumed that
the age of the site falls somewhere within this range, until
excavation has provided evidence for more precise dating.
These dates and the character of the complex serve to place
the component within the time-culture unit referred to by
Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) as the Archaic Stage,
which appears to be equivalent to the period that has been

74

known in the Plains as Intermediate or Middle Prehistoric.1
Although it would be unreliable by itself, negative evidence-the absence of traits generally late in this region,
such as pottery, arrowpoints, double-pointed alternate-beveled knives, and obsidian-also indicates the antiquity of
the Little Sunday site.
Excavation of this site and further investigation of many
similar sites in the Panhandle promise full cultural, temporal, and spatial definition, eventually, of the Little Sunday and other Archaic complexes of this region. Aside from
assembling of evidence, the main problem will be that of
dividing into meaningful units a history of long, slow culture
change recorded only in features and artifacts of few types
and unspecialized forms. This problem is one in which analyses of frequencies and associations of types will be of far
more value than mere presence-absence determinations;
hence the emphasis on quantification in this report.
