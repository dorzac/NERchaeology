Acknowledgements
This dissertation would not have been possible without the unwavering
support of my partner, family, and professors. Sherie Railsback, your patience,
support, and encouragement are the main reasons this dissertation came to
fruition. My mother, Alice H. Galindo and her siblings, Elizabeth Rocha, Pedro
Hernandez, Jr., and Marie Rangel, all contributed their knowledge to this effort
and each one is a source of unending moral support and encouragement. I also
thank all my committee members, Fred Valdez, Jr., Martha Menchaca, Tom
Hester, Sam Wilson, Maria Franklin, and Bill Doolittle, each of whom contributed
according to their specialty and helped to make this a truly interdisciplinary effort.
This archaeological project was conducted in Tamaulipas, México under
Permit 401-36/0848 from the Consejo de Arqueología del Instituto Nacional de
Antropología e Historia (INAH). Financial support for the fieldwork part of this
research project was provided in part by the Peyton Wright Fellowship from the
Department of Anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin. The
Mesoamerican Archaeological Research Laboratory (MARL) at the University of
Texas at Austin provided the use of a Total Data Station (TDS), a Global
Positioning Satellite unit, a digital camera, a laptop computer, and various other
pieces of excavating and recording equipment. The Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin provided mapping and
excavating equipment, including the use of a vehicle and an equipment trailer.
Friends of TARL generously provided the insurance for the project vehicle.
The College of Liberals Arts at the University of Texas at Austin has also
provided financial assistance for the archival and oral history parts of this
v

dissertation project with a Hibbs Research Scholarship (2001). TARL provided an
office space for the writing phase of this project, while MARL supplied the
desktop computer. The information compiled and published by the Spanish
American Genealogical Association was instrumental to this dissertation, as were
the resources of the Benson Latin American Collection Library and the Barker
Texas History Center.
In Mier, several people deserve credit for facilitating my project, including
Arq. Gil Javier Guerra Sandoval, his grandmother Doña María Berta Hinojosa de
Guerra, and their families, who are the landowners of Rancho El Saladito; Profa.
María Lourdes de Balderas M., Secretaria Municipal; Lic. Antonio Guerra
Sandoval (local historian and writer), and Sr. Ruben García Barrera (local
historian and writer). All provided encouragement and invaluable assistance that
enhanced the results of this project. Many others provided friendship and
guidance during my three-month’s stay in Mier, including Felipe Lozano, Angel,
Mari and Rogelio, Blas, Rael, and Chuma. In Roma Arq. Carlo Rugerio, who I
first met in 1998, guided me to people and resources that proved to be essential to
my research. In Ciudad Miguel Aleman, I thank Gustavo Guerra B. and his son
Gustavo Guerra who introduced me to Mae and Boli in Mier.
Volunteers for this project included Ruth A. Mathews and Antonia
Figueroa González, who helped with the mapping phase. Ing. Herminio Aguilar
Garza, a geologist with PEMEX, volunteered for the mapping and excavation
phases. His nephews, Marco Antonio Picazzo, Aaron Quintana Jimenez, Dante
Ochoa Aguilar, and Amir Aguilar Flores also supplied their keen eyesight and
helped with the surveying. Sherie Railsback, Lori Linder, and Tony Linder also
vi

provided surveying assistance. This project would not have been completed in
such a timely fashion without the assistance of Daniel García Hernández, the only
paid staff member of the project and an excellent surveyor and excavator .
Thanks is also due Bruce Moses at the Center for Archeological Research
(CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), who taught the
mapping crew to use the TDS. Also thanks to Anne Fox at CAR, who provided
resourceful assistance with the artifact analysis. Arqlo. Gustavo Ramírez Castilla,
formally of Tamaulipas and now with the INAH office in the state of México, was
instrumental in the preparation of my proposal for INAH and also provided
guidance throughout the project. A fellow graduate student, Apen Ruiz, helped me
translate the INAH proposal.
Numerous fellow graduate students also deserve credit for stimulating
discussions and helpful commentary including, Kerri Barille, Jaime Brandon,
Rissa Trachtman, Whitney Battle, Skye Wagner, Kecia Khan-Perry, Mindy
Bonine, Richard Meadows, Tammy Walter, and Jane Lakeman. Several people
gave me early opportunities to learn archaeological techniques, including James
Neely, James Karbula, Julie Kunen, and my committee supervisor Fred Valdez,
who each deserve a special thanks.
While acknowledging the credit due my peers and supervisors, I accept
full responsibility for any error of fact or interpretation.

Spanish Colonial Ranching Communities
Along the Lower Río Grande Valley

Supervisor: Fred Valdez, Jr.

Before the Río Grande valley became a contested border between the
United States and Mexico, and between predominantly Latino and AngloAmerican societies, it was the northern frontier of Spanish Nuevo Santander and a
border between Spanish Mexico and indigenous societies to the north. The
pobladores, or colonists, who moved into the region from mining communities to
the south in the 1730s, and their descendants to the present day, had to adapt
constantly to the changing political, economic, and social environment, as people
in borderlands always do.
This dissertation involves archaeological excavations and historical
analyses of ranches and towns associated with this border in order to understand
the nature and articulation of the ranch and town settlements, the types of
viii

household production and livestock raising that sustained them, their trade
relationships as reflected in their material culture, and the complex issues of
ethnic identity construction along a contested border through time. Although my
primary goal is to shed new light on a process of colonization and adaptation to a
border context that went on a century before the more-studied Anglo-American
colonization of the region, this is also a personal journey, because I am a
descendant of these early pobladores and my family’s roots are in this border
region.
Between 1748 and 1755, the civilian colonists of Nuevo Santander
established 23 communities, including 6 along the banks of the Río Grande.
These pobladores received porciones, or land grants, in 1767 on which to
establish livestock ranches. The porciones were on both banks of the Río Grande,
because Nuevo Santander’s northern boundary was the Nueces River. The
pobladores and their descendents literally lived con un pie en cada lado, with a
foot on each side of river. Ethnohistoric information documents the early settler
practice of living and growing crops on the south bank, while conducting
ranching activities on the north bank of the Río Grande (Casteñeda 1976). Thus,
these ranches were among the first of their kind in present-day Texas,
representing a unique form of civilian colonization based on the relocation of
entire families, and without major emphasis on missions and presidios.

Chapter 1
Historical and Archaeological Context of Borderlands Project Area
Introduction
Before the Río Grande valley became a contested border between the United
States and Mexico, and between predominantly Latino and Anglo-American societies, it
was the northern frontier of Spanish Nuevo Santander and a border between Spanish
Mexico and indigenous societies to the north. The pobladores, or colonists, who moved
into the region from mining communities to the south in the 1730s, and their descendants
to the present day, had to adapt constantly to the changing political, economic, and
social environment, as people in borderlands always do.
This dissertation involves archaeological excavations and historical analyses of
ranches and towns associated with this border in order to understand the nature and
articulation of the ranch and town settlements, the types of household production and
livestock raising that sustained them, their trade relationships as reflected in their material
culture, and the complex issues of ethnic identity construction along a contested border
through time. Although my primary goal is to shed new light on a process of colonization
and adaptation to a border context that went on a century before the more-studied
Anglo-American colonization of the region, this is also a personal journey, because I am
a descendant of these early pobladores and my family’s roots are in this border region.
Cattle ranching in South Texas matured into an industry during the last decades
of the nineteenth century, but the origins of livestock raising date to the eighteenth
century Spanish colonization efforts at Mission Espíritu Santo (Walter 1997, 1999,
2000), the missions and ranches at San Antonio (Scurlock et al. 1976, Ivey and Fox
1981, Ivey 1983, Jones and Fox 1983, Taylor and Fox 1985, Fox and Houk 1998),

1

and the ranching communities of Nuevo Santander (Alonzo 1998, Bonine 2001,
Chipman 1992, Fleming 1998, Fleming and Pertulla 1999, George 1975, Jackson
1986, Jones 1979, Montejano 1987, Perttula, et. al., 1999). Between 1748 and 1755,
the civilian colonists of Nuevo Santander established 23 communities, including six along
the banks of the Río Grande. These pobladores received porciones, or land grants, in
1767 on which to establish livestock ranches. The porciones were on both banks of the
Río Grande, because Nuevo Santander’s northern boundary was the Nueces River.
The pobladores and their descendents literally lived con un pie en cada lado, with a
foot on each side of river. Ethnohistoric information documents the early settler practice
of living and growing crops on the south bank, while conducting ranching activities on
the north bank of the Río Grande (Casteñeda 1976(3):164). Thus, these ranches were
among the first of their kind in Texas, representing a unique form of civilian colonization
based on the relocation of entire families, and without major emphasis on missions and
presidios.
Until recent decades (Alonzo 1998, Bonine 2001, Chipman 1992, Fleming
1998, Fleming and Pertulla 1999, George 1975, Jackson 1986, Jones 1979,
Montejano 1987, Perttula, et. al., 1999), Texas historians and scholars have either
ignored (Bolton 1921, Tjarks 1997, Yoakum 1935) or minimized (Bannon 1970,
Bolton 1970) the contributions of these Spanish colonial ranching families. The lack of
rigorous scholarly attention to these contributions has compelled local historians and
avocational genealogists to fill the void (Gonzalez 1998, Graham 1994, Hinojosa 1992,
Myers 1969). Although Spanish and later Mexican bureaucracies created a wealth of
information about these early colonists, they also leave many questions about their daily
lives unanswered. Archaeology is well-suited to recover the material culture that can
2

illuminate the colonists’ daily practices and provide the context needed to interpret these
activities. By incorporating evidence from material culture, archival documents, oral
histories, and genealogical data, archaeology can access ethnic identity construction
along the border and examine how they were manipulated and evolved through time.
Organization
The dissertation is organized into eight chapters, which address seven major
aspects of the project. Chapter 1 provides context for the dissertation project by
summarizing the historical and archaeological backgrounds that are pertinent to the area
of study. The historical and archaeological information contained in the author’s master’s
report (Galindo 1999) provide the foundation for this chapter, however, a greater
emphasis has been placed on recent archaeological projects involving rancho settlement
in the region for comparative purposes (e.g., Pertulla, et al. 1999, Fleming and Pertulla
1999, Bonine 2001).
Chapter 2 is a summary of the indigenous heritage of the Lower Río Grande
Valley that illustrates the various populations and their cultural traits as recorded by the
Spaniards. The natural resources of the Río Grande provided sustenance for hunting
and gathering groups for thousands of years. The mid-eighteenth century colonists
encountered indigenous groups and others that had been displaced from Nuevo Leon
and elsewhere. The labor of Indians undoubtedly helped to build Mier and the other
colonial towns along the Río Grande, but the specifics of their contribution remain a
mystery. Adoption of Indian children by colonists is an example of the interaction or the
collision between the two cultures. The scant evidence of this practice suggests that such
children were not treated the same as their natural-born siblings where marriage and
property were concerned.
3

A majority of the families who settled Mier, Tamaulipas, Mexico, were from
Cerralvo in neighboring Nuevo Leon. Chapter 3 examines the continuities and variations
between settlement in Mier and Cerralvo, including the ethnicities of the population,
while comparing the distinct geography, natural resources, and economies. It analyzes
how the pobladores’ processes of adapting to the ranchos along the Lower Río Grande
were guided by their previous experiences. Cattle and a distinct herding method are
traced through Cerralvo to Mier, establishing the invaluable contributions made by
Nuevo Santander colonists to the nineteenth-century Anglo cattle industry.
Chapter 4 traces the evolution of Charles E. Orser, Jr. and Brian M. Fagan’s
(1994) definition of historical archaeology that advocates a multi-disciplinary approach,
with the focus on the daily lives of the ordinary people who have traditionally been
ignored by academicians. This chapter incorporates the elements of Orser and Fagan’s
definition into the archaeology of South Texas and northeastern México by exploring the
ethnic identities of the colonists. In the process, I challenge some of the historicized
myths associated with the region, including those concerning settlement patterns and the
myth of racial purity.
Chapter 5 summarizes the various archaeological concepts of households and
household production with the goal of better understanding the morphology and functions of Spanish colonial rancho settlements. Within this framework, three early nineteenth-century ranchos, which appear in several sets of census data for Mier, are
reconstructed with the help of genealogical records and analyzed in terms of household
organization and production.
Chapter 6 provides an ethnohistorical summary of the eighteenth- and nineteethcentury rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas, the likely precursor of modern El Rancho
4

Saladito. Geographical and genealogical data are combined with ethnographic interviews to complement the archaeological data and guide the interpretation of it.
Chapter 7 contains the excavation summary for each suboperation, the artifact
analysis, and an interpretation of the material record. Contrary to traditional conceptions
about the isolation of the frontier, the archaeological record reveals the wide-reaching
trade relationships that sustained the Nuevo Santander colonists . The summary and
conclusions form Chapter 8.
Historical Background
This dissertation is built upon a foundation of ethnohistorical and genealogical
research, which in part was the author’s Master’s report (Galindo 1999). To add
information and perspective to the scant data about Mier that I found written in English,
I relied on Spanish-language historical and archival sources, local histories, and genealogical publications by some of the area families.
Mier was established in 1753 at the confluence of the Río Grande and the Río
Alamo by Capt. José Florencio Chapa and 38 families from Cerralvo, Nuevo Leon,
who joined 19 families that were already living on ranches in the area (Graham 1994:19,
Sánchez 1994:28). The settlement was part of José de Escandón’s colonization plan for
the Province of Nuevo Santander (Alonzo 1998: 30). Escandón, Conde de Sierra
Gorda, received in 1746 a viceregal commission to conquer and settle the area which
lay east of the Sierra Madre Oriental and stretched from the Panuco River in Mexico to
La Bahia del Espíritu Santo on the present-day Texas Gulf Coast (Myers 1969:15).
The Spanish crown was motivated to colonize this area in part by the French
attempt at settlement at Matagorda Bay and their continued presence in Louisiana
(George 1975:7). Another factor was the Native American population of the region who
5

posed a serious threat to established settlements in Nuevo Leon and Coahuila and
would become increasingly attracted to the large herds of cattle and horses that roamed
unattended in the Spanish style of ranching (Myers 1969:18, George 1975:7, 27).
Finally, the possibility of precious ores in the Tamaulipi Mountains and the availability of
salt along aboriginal trails also made this area attractive for colonization (George
1975:7).
Between 1748 and 1755 Escandón, along with about 3,000 colonists and 146
soldiers, established 23 communities. The settlers did not receive individual land grants
until 1767; however, most received a ten-year tax exemption, seed, supplies, and
money. This was not the case in Mier, which was founded at no cost to the crown,
although the pobladores did receive grants of land.
One of six communities along the Lower Río Grande Valley (Figure 1), Mier
grew out of the ranch headquarters of José Felix de Almondoz that was formed in 1734
by 166 people in 19 families (Casteñada 1976:171, Graham 1994:19). It was originally
called El Paso del Cántaro and located eight leagues northwest of Camargo. When
Camargo was established in 1749 these 19 families were forced to enroll as settlers of
that community or be driven off their land (Casteñada 1976:171). These same families
would form the core of the population of Mier on March 6, 1753, when the town was
renamed and organized as part of Nuevo Santander. Mier was the site of the easiest
ford of the Río Grande and also had high-quality limestone beds for construction
material (Scott 1937:81). It was primarily a ranching community, but also enjoyed good
commerce with Nuevo Leon, where many settlers had their origins and maintained
connections (Scott 1937:81).

Porciones, or Land Grants
Porciones, or land grants, were awarded to settlers in Nuevo Santander in
rectangular strips along the Río Grande and other tributaries. In Mier there was a 14year delay between the establishment of the town and the granting of land. Porciones
included between 1/2 and 9/13 of a mile in river frontage to ensure water access for
7

livestock or irrigation and were 11 to 14 miles deep, usually encompassing 4,200 to
6,200 acres (Sánchez 1994:33, Alonzo 1998:40). The amount of land colonists received depended on their previous service to the crown in a military or civilian capacity,
and the number of years that they had lived in the community (Myers 1969:21). The
allotments were also sized according to the climate and the use to which the land would
be put. If the land had limited access to water, rendering it unsuitable for agriculture, and
would instead be used for pasturing livestock, then the colonists received a larger grant
(Myers 1969:21). Land suitable for irrigation and farming was divided into smaller units.
There were three types of the larger, stock-raising grants, each called a sitio, or
location. Sitio de ganado major was for raising large animals, such as horses, cows,
burros, and mules, and usually contained about 4,336 acres (Myers 1969:21). Sitio de
ganado menor was for raising sheep and goats, and usually contained about 1,920
acres (Myers 1969:21). Sitio de criadero de ganado, or cattle breeding ranch, contained about 1,084 acres (Myers 1969:21).
The settlers were obligated to take possession of the land, to begin raising
stock, and to defend their property from Native American encroachment. The families
were required by Escandón to live in town while men or laborers commuted back and
forth to the ranch, although colonists actually adopted several settlement strategies
(Graham 1994:22).
In Mier 80 porciones were designated when the land was surveyed in 1767
(Scott 1937:81). Land for a mission was also set aside at this time. Mier’s land grants
were located in what today are the municipalities of Mier and Cuidad Miguel Aleman in
northern Tamaulipas, and the southern part of Starr County in Texas, including the town
of Roma. The map of the porciones (Figure 2) is based on several sources—primarily
8

an unprovenienced and undated copy of a map on file with the Texas General Land
Office. I projected boundary lines that had faded on the original map and extended the
numbering where I could with confidence. I was able to assign neither porción 9 nor 30
through 32 to a place on the map. Additionally, there are large areas of the map without
numbers. I also used information from a 1958 map of Mier that illustrates porciones 33
through 54 and provides data about the porciones awarded for the mission. Information
about the 24 porciones located north of the Río Grande (55 through 78) comes from
Starr County maps dating from 1930 and 1974.
Summary of Marriage and Inheritance Patterns Among Mier’s Pobladores
The marriage and inheritance patterns offer clues to the motivations and strategies employed by the early settlers. Fifty-five percent of the 94 marriages studied
involve a spouse from another landowning family (Galindo 1999). In 37.5 percent of the
families the porciones involved are adjacent to each other. A pattern of multiple siblings
in one family marrying into the same other family is evident in 17 of the 94 (or 18
percent) unions examined. Multiple-sibling marriages occur in 12 of the 32 families
studied (or 37.5 percent).
Oral history indicates that such intermarrying practices were necessary among a
limited population on the frontier (Alice H. Galindo personal communication 1997). It
also suggests that these marriage practices persisted beyond the frontier to urban areas
and long after the population had expanded (Alice H. Galindo personal communication
1997).

Previous Archaeological Investigations
Introduction
The research of historic archaeology of South Texas and Northeastern Mexico
can be traced back a mere 50 years to the limited excavations and surveys undertaken
when the Falcon Dam and Reservoir was constructed along the Río Grande as a binational project. The contributions of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century pobladores, or
Spanish colonists, have been largely ignored by academicians interested in early Texas
history. Nonetheless, the families who settled Nuevo Santander and established ranchos
for livestock raising laid the foundation of the cattle industry for which Texas became
famous. This project, informed by local historians and oral traditions, uses census and
demographic data to supplement the limited archaeology accomplished to date in the
area.
Figure 3 illustrates the settlements and ranches that were documented in the
flood plain of the Falcon Reservoir before it was constructed. In February 1949, Alex
Krieger from the University of Texas at Austin surveyed the area that would become the
new spillway for the National Parks Service (Krieger and Hughes 1950). A total of 55
sites documented by Krieger and Jack Hughes during 1949 and 1950 as they conducted an archaeological survey and testing along the entire length of the U.S. side of
the proposed reservoir. The next year, the River Basins Survey of the Smithsonian
Institution conducted emergency excavations of three sites, including two historic sites,
in what became the first major archaeological investigation in the area (Hartle and
Stephenson 1951). Fortunately, the artifacts from these excavations were recently
analyzed (Bonine 2001) and this analysis joins investigations at Los Corralitos and
Cabaseño ranches in Zapata County, Texas (Fleming and Pertulla 1999, Pertulla, et al.

1999), and research of a more ethnographic nature focusing on Mier, Tamaulipas,
Mexico, (Galindo 1999). The 1950 survey and testing included work by Luís Aveleyra
Arroyo de Anda, an archaeologist from INAH who spent 10 days surveying the Mexican shore line. An important observation based on this survey that survives in Krieger
and Hughes’ work is the similarity between the material culture of both sides of the Río
Grande.The following sections summarize the previous archaeological research in the
area and compare the sites to settlement at Rancho El Saladito.
Excavations at 41SR39 and 41SR43 in Starr County, Texas
The emergency excavations conducted at 41SR39 and 41SR43 by Donald
Hartle and Robert Stephenson in February and March of 1951, were prompted by their
impending destruction. They excavated two historic sites within 500 feet of each other.
Both residential areas were in the path of Falcon Dam’s spillway. Each site consisted of
multiple one-room stone structures arranged along a water source, either the arroyo or
the Río Grande. The associated features included middens, a fireplace, and a storage
pit. The artifacts from these excavations were stored at TARL for 50 years before they
were analyzed in a thesis by Mindy Bonine (2001).
41SR39 Artifacts
The floors of the interiors of two stone structures were excavated and interpreted as dwelling units occupied during the latter half of the eighteenth century, based
on construction techniques and an analysis of the Mexican Majolicas in the collection
(Bonine 2001, Goggin 1968). The stone structures, where preserved and recorded,
were constructed of dry-laid, chinked masonry, that was plastered on the interior. The
majority of the 3,441 recovered artifacts at 41SR39 are ceramic, comprising 96% of
the total. Other artifacts include those of bone, lithic, and glass, which total 3.6%. A
13

smaller sample of metal and shell artifacts was encountered in the excavations (Bonine
2001).
Alex Krieger labelled the locally-made earthenware jars and ollas, “Mier Plain,”
based on the ceramic sample from 41SR39 and 41SR43 (Hartle and Stephenson 1951,
Kreiger and Hughes 1950).

*(Bonine 2001)

Bonine (2001) also uses ceramic distribution to interpret the function of the
structures, finding more evidence of cooking, serving, and storing vessels at House 1
than at House 2. In fact, the ceramic count is ten times greater at House 1 and the low
numbers of ceramics distinguishes House 2 from all the other structures at the two sites.
If the ceramic evidence is not weighty enough, House 1 also contains the only fireplace
documented at either site, which lends credence to Bonine’s interpretation of House 1
as a kitchen.
41SR43 Artifacts
The floors of the interiors of four stone structures were excavated and inter-

14

preted as dwelling units occupied contemporaneously with 41SR39 (Bonine 2001). The
stone structures were similarly constructed with better preservation of the plastered
interior walls. Likewise, the majority of the 5,102 recovered artifacts at 41SR43 are
ceramic, comprising 89% of the total. Other artifacts include those of lithic and bone,
which together comprise 9% of the total. A smaller sample of shell, metal, and glass
artifacts was encountered in the excavations (Bonine 2001).

*(Bonine 2001)

Again, Bonine (2001) compares the ceramic count and ratios of types found in
each structure and interprets House 1 to be a place of food preparation and consumption, and/or a dwelling used for general living. House 4 is also a general living area, but
with less ceramic evidence for food preparation and consumption. The two other
structures suffered more from erosional damage and no attempt to interpret their
function was made.
At neither site did the investigators identify courtyards, patios, irrigation systems,
gardens, outside cooking features, fences, or jacales (Bonine 2001).

Excavations at Cabaseño Ranch (41ZP79), Zapata County, Texas
During the 1990s a prolonged drought period caused the Falcon Reservoir to
drop to record low water levels, thus exposing some 40 historic archeological sites.
These sites were recorded and studied during 1996 through a joint effort by the National Park Service, the Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, and the University of Texas at Austin (Perttula et al. 1996).
This effort stands in sharp contrast to the decades of inaction on the part of the
International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), the federal agency charged
with the management and protection of archeological sites in the reservoir under both
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Archeological Resources
Protection Act of 1979 (Perttula et al. 1996). The IBWC’s inaction is not surprising
given the agency’s deplorable treatment of the local people who were displaced when
the reservoir was opened in 1953 (Byfield 1966). Many people whose property was
condemned by the IBWC were never properly compensated (Byfield 1996:48-50). If
the agency did not respect or value living people and their property, it is not surprising
that the same agency does not respect or value the vulnerable historic archaeological
sites that represent these same people’s ancestors.
Timothy K. Perttula returned to Area I at the Cabaseño site (41ZP79) in 1998
and conducted archaeological excavations. The ranching settlement at Area I appears to
date between 1775 and 1800, based on the presence of certain types of majolicas and
the absence of both European ceramic wares and bottle glass (Perttula et al. 1999:327328). As such, Area I at the Cabaseño site represents one of the earliest Nuevo
Santander ranchos identified at Falcon Reservoir (Perttula et al. 1999:328). Majolica

16

types found at Area I include Puebla Blue and White II, San Elizario Polychrome,
Puebla Green on White, Aranama Polychrome, and Huejotzingo Blue on White
(Perttula et al. 1999:328).
The Cabaseño site is at the confluence of the Arroyo Cabaseño and the Río
Grande and was associated with the porciones awarded to the pobladores of Revilla
(now Guerrero Viejo). Five features were identified at Area I, including three stone
structure foundations and two bone-filled pits, all within an approximate area of 25 X
20 meters (Perttula et al. 1999:331). The foundations are about 6.5 X 4 meters and are
comprised of uncut sandstone fieldstone stacked one to two courses high (Perttula et al.
1999:331). The bone pits contain evidence of cow, sheep, and goat remains (Perttula et
al. 1999:331, 336). There is probably an associated midden, but during the 1998 field
season it remained underwater (Perttula et al. 1999:331).
About 50 meters south of Area I is the most substantial occupation at
Cabaseño, dating to the mid-nineteenth century, based on the presence of Englishware
and Guanajuato Polychrome majolica (Perttula et al. 1999:330). Features include a
large two-room stone structure, two smaller stone structures, a lime pit, several trash
middens, and a possible horno, or an outdoor baking or cooking oven (Perttula et al.
1999:330).
About 20 meters east of Area I are features that date to the early twentieth
century, including a corral, a midden, a two-room pier construction, and two collapsed
jacales, or thatched-roof and wood post structures that may have been plastered
(Perttula et al. 1999:330).

Excavations at San José de Corralitos Ranch, Zapata County, Texas
San José de Corralitos, or Los Corralitos (small corrals), was established in
1766 by José Fernando Vidaurri. He was the grandson of José Vásquez Borregos, who
received a 329,000 acre land grant from the Spanish crown to found Nuestra Señora
de Dolores hacienda in 1750 (Fleming and Perttula 1999:395). Los Corralitos was a
5,000 acre subdivision of this grant (Fleming and Perttula 1999:395). Dolores and
Laredo were the only two of the six Nuevo Santander communities along the Río
Grande to be on the river’s north bank, or in modern-day Texas, although porciones
were awarded on both banks of the river by every settlement except Dolores.
Dolores was different from the other communities in that it maintained a
mounted security force for protection from incessant Indian attacks, no mission was
ever associated with it, its population did not grow as fast as the other towns, and the
pobladores of Dolores did not receive their own land grants; instead they were essentially hired laborers at a private hacienda (Scott 1937:39).
By 1786 a fortaleza, or fort, was completed at Los Corralitos, which suggest
that this is the earliest known ranch building still standing in Texas (Fleming and Perttula
1999:395). Its age is based on archival documents and several defensive architectural
features, including troneras, or gunports, and a lack of windows (Fleming and Perttula
1999:395, 400). The fortaleza is a one-room structure with a single doorway and six
troneras (Fleming and Perttula 1999:400). It measures 33 feet long by 18.33 feet wide
by 13.5 feet high and is the closest building to the river (Fleming and Perttula
1999:400). The other stone structure, which is about 100 years younger, is at a right
angle to the fortaleza, separated by about 45 meters (Fleming and Perttula 1999:400).
The fortaleza, or Building 1, is constructed of roughly dressed sandstone blocks
18

with mud mortar (Fleming and Perttula 1999:400). The larger blocks are at the four
corners of the building and each has two cut faces (Fleming and Perttula 1999:400).
Chinking stones were used to fill in the gaps left by the irregular-shaped blocks, which
formed the walls between 2.47 feet and 2.83 feet thick (Fleming and Perttula
1999:400). Both stone structures at Los Corralitos now have metal roofs, but a small
portion of the fortaleza’s original fireproof roof survives. The type of construction is
known as terrado, or layered (Fleming and Perttula 1999:400). The additional weight
of the plastered roof was supported by a series of 20 vigas, or beams, that were then
covered perpendicularly by a layer of 1 inch X 4 inch boards (Fleming and Perttula
1999:400). On top of this were placed a layer of small stones that were mortared and
coated with a mixture of lime, sand, and gravel, known as chipichil (Fleming and
Perttula 1999:400). The flat roof was slightly sloped for drainage and five wooden
canales, or roof drains, were originally along the west side of the fortaleza (Fleming and
Perttula 1999:400). There were also six protected areas for roof-top defenders
(Fleming and Perttula 1999:401).
Building 2 has two rooms and probably dates to the late nineteenth century
(Fleming and Perttula 1999:401). It measures 51.83 feet X 20.17 feet and has two
external doorways (Fleming and Perttula 1999:401). Its flat roof is similarly constructed
terrado, with vigas, smaller boards, and chipichil (Fleming and Perttula 1999:401).
Building 2 has no troneras or other defensive features.
Sharon E. Fleming and Perttula establish a framework for the architectural
evolution of ranch houses in Zapata County, although it may well apply to other Nuevo
Santander ranchos as well. The first period is defined from 1750 to 1848 and is called
the Spanish-Mexican Colonial Ranch Buildings (Fleming and Perttula 1999:405). These
19

are defined by their defensive architectural features, which may include thick stone wall
construction, a flat fireproof plastered roof, troneras, fortified rooftop positions, few
doorways, and/or a lack of windows (Fleming and Perttula 1999:406).
Their second division is defined from 1849 to 1874+ and is called the PostColonial Ranch Buildings (Fleming and Perttula 1999:406). This is a transition period
during which defensive architectural features continue to be incorporated into new
construction. Eventually decorative and functional features are developed that replace
most of the defensive features (Fleming and Perttula 1999:406). These are outward
signs that a building’s defensibility is no longer the primary concern of its residents,
although some features like flat plastered roofs and a lack of windows continue to be
popular (Fleming and Perttula 1999:406).
The last division in Fleming and Perttula’s framework is from the last quarter of
the nineteenth century to the present and is called the Unfortified Ranch Buildings
(Fleming and Perttula 1999:407). Distinctive changes include the lack of troneras, the
introduction of windows, wider doors, thinner walls, and pitched roofs with combustile
roofing materials (Fleming and Perttula 1999:407).
Jacales
The most enduring house form in the Lower Río Grande area, the jacal, does
not fit into the above framework. Stone buildings were built by wealthier people or
those with a convenient quarry. Jacales might have only been used as a temporary
shelter for members of the upper class during the construction of a stone house, but for
most of the population they were permanent residences. Jacales continue to be constructed and used in the area around Mier and lots of other places in Mexico and
Central America. It is a no-frills style of construction that uses readily-available material:
20

larger poles are placed vertically in a footing trench, then smaller branches are woven
horizontally between the poles. The walls might be plastered on the interior, exterior, or
both. A center pole helps support the thatch roof, which was originally made of grass or
cane, although modern jacales have metal roofs.
It is impossible to say exactly when pobladores began building jacales, but it
seems reasonable that they adopted this building method from indigenous groups.
Granted, most of the Indians of the Lower Río Grande were mobile hunters and gatherers who used simple ramadas, but near Mier at least two groups, the Garzas and
Malaguitas or Malahuecos, built houses of mats and thatch that they dismantled and
moved (Salinas 1990:122). Certainly, the addition of wattle, daub, and plaster was a
later innovation, but essentially jacales represent an enduring adaptation of indigenous
technology. The remains of jacales are difficult, if not impossible, to locate
archaeologically, but their importance to the survival of the Nuevo Santander
pobladores should not be forgotten.
An undated survey of the ranchos of Mier, located in that city’s archives,
documents the prevalence of “casas de paja,” (literally: straw or thatch houses), among
eighteenth-century colonists (Galindo 1999:119-121). This likely refers to what are
today called jacales. Table 3 reproduces the enumeration of buildings at various ranchos
of Mier, which was divided by relative location to the area rivers. This list was located in
the Casa de Cultura Archivo de Mier (Mier Archives) in Box G-25 and inside a folder
marked 1753, although the actual document is not dated. One indication that the
document may actually date to sometime after the 1770s is a reference to Roma (in the
ranch name “El Arroyo Frente de Roma”), which was officially founded in 1765.
This building survey illustrates the abundance of jacales relative to stone build21

ings. Jacales outnumber stone structures by a ratio of 37 to 1. On the 38 ranches listed
in Table 3, there were 296 straw houses, or jacales, and only 8 stone houses. Perhaps
the prevalence of jacales gives some indication of the relative security of the ranchos of
Mier as compared to other areas where fortified buildings were essential.

Comparing Rancho El Saladito to Previous Archaeological Research
in the Area
The archaeological evidence produced by this research project at Rancho El
Saladito must be considered in the context of previous research. In all of the examples
cited in this chapter, stone foundations or buildings were documented. However, at
Rancho El Saladito in the area of earliest occupation (east of the Arroyo Saladito) no
stone structures were located. On the west side of the arroyo is a stone structure built in
1928 and the remains of an earlier outdoor horno, that according to oral history was
associated with a jacale.
Evidence is presented in Chapter 6 that indicates the precursor of Rancho El
Saladito was El Rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas, which was founded by the recipient
of Mier Porción 6, Ramón Guerra. Although this ranch is not named in the above survey
of house types, it is likely that Los Guerras (with 11 jacales) describes the same ranch,
considering its location between Las Flores (Mier Porción 7) and Sabinitas (Mier
Porción 5). Los Guerras also is listed near La Ysla de los Hinojosas, which is across the
Río Grande from Rancho El Saladito.
Given the low occurrence overall of stone buildings, it is not surprising that
eighteenth- or nineteenth-century examples were not encountered at Rancho El
Saladito. This is despite the existence of a convenient quarry, and the occurrence of
stone buildings at 41ZP39, 41ZP43, Cabaseño, and Los Corralitos. One possible
explanation is that sites on the north bank of the Río Grande were more prone to Indian
attacks and thus needed the protection afforded by stone.
Ceramic artifacts at Rancho El Saladito, unlike architecture, are very similar to
those from 41ZP39, 41ZP43, and Cabaseño. Majolica types are identical, as are Mier
24

Plainwares forms. Later Englishwares also bear uncanny resemblances and may indicate
either similar aesthetic tastes among consumers or the prevelance of certain decorative
types in the marketplace.
Ceramics from mission contexts in other parts of Texas, although not summarized in this chapter, can also be compared to the collection from Rancho El Saladito
with informative conclusions. Ceramics from Texas mission contexts were studied in a
type collection at the Center for Archeological Research at the University of Texas at
San Antonio. Basic differences between the two collections include the lack of French
faience or Chinese porcelain in the Rancho El Saladito collection. Less expensive
majolica types such as Huetzingo Blue on White and Puebla Green on White are more
common in the ranch context.
Thus, although it is helpful to study the broad context into which Rancho El
Saladito fits, in the areas of architecture and ceramic artifacts El Saladito stands apart
from its neighbors to the north on ranches and at missions. There are likely multiple
reasons for these differences, not the least of which is the state of relations with the
indigenous people that Mier colonists encountered. The next chapter summarizes the
numerous Indian groups associated with Mier and surrounding communities and serves
as a reminder that the Nuevo Santander colonists did not enter an empty landscape.
Rather they were met by various indigenous groups who may have shared certain
cultural traits, but also maintained their own unique identities. Undoubtedly, some
members of these groups contributed their labor, knowledge, and skills to help the
colony succeed. These contributions are evident today in architecture and in the nutritional and medicinal use of native plants.

Chapter 2
The Indigenous Heritage of the Río Grande Communities of Nuevo Santander
The Nuevo Santander colonists who established the six Río Grande settlements
of the mid-eighteenth century, including Mier, did not enter an unpopulated landscape.
Both native inhabitants, and later, enterprising ranchers from Nuevo León, preceded
them. The natural resources of the Río Grande had been supporting indigenous hunting
and gathering groups for thousands of years, as the prehistoric archaeology of the region
attests (Boyd 1997; Boyd, et al. 1997; Epstein 1969; Hester 1980; 1989a; 1989b;
1990; 1995; McClurkan 1980; MacNeish 1958; Nance 1980; Suhm, Kreiger and
Jelks 1954; Taylor 1937, 1966). By 1582, when Cerralvo was first founded as the
capital (Contreras López 1999:29), the colonizers of Nuevo León began displacing
indigenous groups. During the early years of Nuevo León, many Indians were captured
and sold into slavery for work in the mines near Zacatecas, Sombrerete, and Mazapil
(Salinas 1990:15). Some who escaped this fate migrated to the shores of the Río
Grande, joining groups already there.
Fresh water in this arid region attracted settlements across the millennia. The
area of northeastern México and south Texas adjacent to the Gulf of México is known
as the Gulf Coastal Plain or the Gulf Coastal Lowlands (West 1964:57-61). The
foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental form the boundary of this plain in Tamaulipas. In
Texas the Gulf Coastal Plain ends at the Balcones Escarpment of the Edwards Plateau.
Nuevo Santander was bounded by two of the region’s three perennial rivers: the
Río San Fernando to the south and the Río Nueces to the north. The third, the Río
Grande, bisected the colony. All three deliver water to the Gulf of México, with the
exception of the Río Grande in the last few decades. Streams in this region are generally

26

small and intermittent, however, between Camargo and Laredo there are several
perennial streams, including the Río San Juan, the Río Alamo, (which flows through
Mier), and the Río Salado. All three feed into the Río Grande. Early European
observers consistently reported indigenous groups along these waterways (Salinas
1990:11).
The colonial record contains few details regarding the indigenous populations
and their culture. “For any particular Indian group, little can be said about its culture at
any time during the 367-year period covered by documents” (Salinas 1990:135).
Martín Salinas’ comprehensive effort to correlate the indigenous groups discussed in
Spanish colonial primary documents (1990) makes a distinction between native groups
and those that migrated to the Río Grande area. Large numbers of displaced Indians
occupied eastern Nuevo León during the first half of the eighteenth century (Salinas
1990:14). Their prolonged attacks on small area settlements were a contributing factor
to the establishment of Nuevo Santander, which would lead to their further displacement
and/or assimilation. The following sections summarize the prehistoric archaeology of the
area and then provide the group names and cultural traits of Indian groups recorded in
colonial documents for the area around Mier, Tamaulipas.
Prehistoric Archaeology of the Area
The prehistory of northeastern México was first examined with the fieldwork of
Richard MacNeish (1958) in Tamaulipas during the 1940s. Walter Taylor was also an
early contributor with an archaeological survey of Coahuila (1937), and his summary of
cultures in northeastern México (1966). Luis Aveleyra Arroyo de Anda and others
excavated a vertical shaft cave in Coahuila during 1953 and 1954 (Nance 1992:5).
Work continued in 1960s with the Northeast México Archaeological Project, which
27

was directed by Jeremiah F. Epstein and involved excavations at nine sites and limited
surveying of the region (Nance 1992:5). Epstein’s survey focused mainly on Nuevo
León, but also involved eastern Coahuila and northwestern Tamaulipas (Epstein
1969:xi).
The construction of the Falcon Dam and Reservoir, completed in 1953,
prompted archaeological survey and limited excavations through the River Basin
Survey Projects (Hartle and Stephenson 1951, Kreiger and Hughes 1950). Upon this
foundation, Dee Ann Suhm, Alex Krieger and Edward Jelks (1954) developed the
first chronology for the prehistoric component of the region, based on projectile
points and associated artifacts. Although a substantial contribution at the time, their
work has since become regarded as too simplistic and unable to account for the
cultural diversity that has become evident through subsequent work in the area (Boyd,
et al. 1997). Recent work by Salinas (1990) has demonstrated the linguistic and
cultural diversity of indigenous groups in South Texas. The cultural manifestations of
South Texas indigenous groups have been described as “often varying distinctly from
stream to stream” (Hester 1980).
The chronology developed by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) is imperfect,
but it remains a useful organizing device and for this reason a summary of their
chronology is provided. Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) divided the Archaic stage in
the Falcon Reservior area into two foci: Falcon and Mier. Falcon Focus artifacts
were said to include large dart points and to represent lithic technologies that
persisted for thousands of years and into the Spanish colonial period. Tortugas were
the most common type found, often with Abasolo and Refugio. Langtry, Shumla, and
Almagre are other types that appear infrequently in South Texas contexts. The Falcon
28

Focus was thought to have lasted from 5000 B.C. to A.D. 500 or 1000 (Suhm, Krieger
and Jelks 1954).
The Mier Focus represented a continuation of the Falcon Focus and associated
artifacts, plus the appearance of two familiar but diminutive types: Matamoros and
Catan. Additionally, several small arrow points appear, including Fresno, Perdiz, and
Starr, which was considered a local type. Langtry, Shumla, and Almagre continued to
be evident. Matamoros and Catan were thought to have chronolocial significance in
southern Tamaulipas (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954). Tortugas and Abasolo are
associated with pre-ceramic excavation levels, whereas Matamoros and Catan are
found in later ceramic levels. One Catan point was recovered at Rancho El Saladito in a
surface collection.
Starr points are triangular with lateral edges ranging from straight to concave.
Basal concavity ranges from slightly concave to V-shaped with longish ears. Many Starr
points are roughly equilateral, but this varies from more elongated to stubby. Starr points
are found along the Lower Río Grande Valley and the Lower Texas Coast and are
associated with the Brownsville Complex during the Late Prehistoric (Prewitt 1995:130;
Turner and Hester 1993:231). Two Starr points were recovered during the
archeological project at Rancho El Saladito: one in an excavation unit and the other in a
surface collection.
The Mier Focus was alternatively described as the transitional phase between
the Falcon Focus and historic times or as the late phase of the Falcon Phase; either way
it was dated from A.D. 500 or 1000 until the Late Prehistoric period (Suhm, Krieger
and Jelks 1954).

29

The Late Prehistoric Period in southern Texas shares some cultural patterns with
Central Texas, especially regarding the Toyah Horizon (Black 1986, Hester 1995:443).
Dart points such as Ensor, Matamoros, Catan, and Zavala persist into Late Prehistoric
contexts and contribute to the uncertainties about the internal chronology of the region
(Hester 1995:443). Along the Río Grande below Laredo the common projectile points
are Starr, Caracara, and Toyah types.
MacNeish (1958:189) defines a class of artifacts that are diagnostic of the
Brownsville Complex. The primary diagnostic artifacts are shell disks and pierced shell
disk beads, columella plugs, rectangular conch shell pendants, mollusk shell scrapers,
and Starr, Fresno, and Matamoros projectile points. Items which distinguish the
Brownsville Complex include pierced whole conch shells, small snail shell beads, conical
pumice pipes, bivalve beads, Marginella beads, conch shell fishhooks, Cameron points,
chipped pin-like drills, shell plugs with rectangular cross-sections, and columella gouges
(MacNeish 1958:189). Based on the size of their projectile points, MacNeish thought
the inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers who used bows and arrows and
relied heavily on marine resources (MacNeish 1958:189).
Indian Groups Recorded Along the Río Grande
It is difficult to identify with certainty the groups that occupied eastern Nuevo
León because the Spanish used descriptive names and not their native ones (Salinas
1990:17). Group names were often duplicated across vast geographical regions among
unrelated peoples (Campbell and Campbell 1985:9-10). These practices make it
impossible in most cases to determine the continuity between groups that may have
migrated from Nuevo León to the Río Grande. Instead, the next section will concentrate
on the Indian groups identified in colonial documents that were associated with the six
30

Río Grande settlements of Laredo, Dolores, Revilla, Mier, Camargo, and Reynosa. The
mission registers for Camargo and Reynosa are now missing, but Herbert E. Bolton
examined both of these registers early in the twentieth century and his research is the
foundation for later work by Salinas (1990). Martín Salinas, who built upon a
foundation of ethnographic work laid by T. N. Campbell, examined the primary
documents created by the Spanish and extracted the scattered bits of information about
indigeous groups on both banks of the lower Río Grande. The following Table 4
summarizes 39 Indian groups known from Mier and surrounding areas as compiled
from Salinas (1990). The table is followed by a series of maps illustrating the relative
location of the Indian groups (Figures 4, 5, and 6). Next a summary of the textual
references and graphic representations of Indian individuals and groups found in the
colonial record is presented. The chapter concludes with an examination of 12 Indian
groups specifically associated with Mier and a summary of the cultural traits associated
with them collectively.
Textual References to Local Indian Groups
When Jose de Escandón explored the region that became Nuevo Santander, he
recorded at least 31 separately named Indian groups (Salinas 1990:19). For his 1747
report, Escandón apparently relied on Capitán Santiago, a leader of the Comecrudo
group he encountered near his base camp, which was near the modern city of
Matamoros (Salinas 1990:29). He reported that about 2,500 families lived south of the
Río Grande, with the largest group being the Comecrudos (Salinas 1990:29). Escandón
described Indians that fished and hunted deer and birds with bows and arrows (Salinas
1990:29). He noted that the men wore no clothing, while the women wore skirts made
of animal skins or grass (Salinas 1990:29). Capitán Santiago used smoke signals to

166 individuals in 27 families, besides those who had not registered, and several
servants (Guerra 1989:17). He mentioned two operative irrigation canals along the Río

does not quantify, Escandón reported there are many peaceful Indians who reside and
work with the colonists (Guerra 1989:18). Two years later when Agustín López de la
Cámara Alta inspected Mier there were 95 members of the Garza tribe (28 men and 67
women and children), led by Francisco and Margarita, a member of the extinct Zalayas
group who had become a leader of the Garzas (Guerra 1989:23). She was described

as a widow, a Christian, and a translator who lived in the home of Capt. Jose Florencio
de Chapa so he could better subjugate them (Guerra 1989:23). The census also
included 27 members of the Malahuecos group (8 men and 19 women and children),
which was led by Antonio de la Cruz.
López de la Cámara Alta inspected Nuevo Santander in 1757 and recorded 14
Indian groups for the Río Grande area (Salinas 1990:30). He wrote observations about
41

eight of these that he grouped together as having similar cultural traits. For example, he
noted that all of them were tattooed, although he could discern no correlation between
the tattoo patterns and their ethnic affiliation (Salinas 1990:31). The men of these groups
sported tattoos only on their faces, while women adorned both their faces and bodies
(Salinas 1990:31). López de la Cámara Alta alluded that these eight groups spoke
dialects of the same language, which may have been Comecrudo (Salinas 1990:31).
La Mision de la Purísima Concepción
The mission at Mier seems to have existed in name only from its establishment in
1753, with no record of any structures until the construction of the church Purísima
Concepción began in 1780 and was completed in 1795 in the main town square
(Guerra 1989:31, Salinas 1990:157). Irrigation projects in neighboring towns of Revilla
and Camargo failed, either because the rivers were too entrenched or floods wiped out
any efforts to dig canals or plant in the alluvial soils. The same situation prevailed at
Mier. The mission, if it existed at all in the early years of the settlement, probably could
not have provided for the Indians. They would have been forced to continue hunting and
gathering for themselves, much like the situation in neighboring towns.
Mier did not have a resident priest until 1767; instead, the settlement relied on
the priest at Camargo for the first fourteen years of its existence. Incidently, no mission
lands were granted until 1767 when the pobladores also received their porciones and
solares, or town lots. The mission was assigned Porción 79, but I have never been able
to find a map with that numbered porción on it. The closest I came was on a 1985 city
planning map in the Presidente Municipal’s office that has “Tierras de la Mision” written
across six unnumbered porciones south of the Río Alamo. They are labeled from east to
west, Lajita, Borrega, Corral de Barranca, Penitas, Tepehuaje, and Santa Domingo. A
42

table included on the map gives the dimensions and areas of the porciones, which total
more than 150 hectares. The planning map was drawn by civil engineer Jesus Gomez
Cuellar, who based it on another 1958 map.
Graphic Representation of Indigenous Individuals or Groups
There are two undated and anonymous drawings in the archives at Mier that
depict Indians and appear to have been drawn by a non-European artist, based on
several graphic representations (Arq. Carlos Rugerio, personal communication 1998).
The drawings must be post-1795 because a completed church is depicted.
The first drawing shows a Friar Pedro Martín addressing three Indians, who
may represent the leaders of their respective groups (Figure 7). Their names are given
as Achitome, Oxtipaque, and Tuzcatp, or Tuzcatl. In the background is the mission
church, which was completed after the 1780s. In the upper right corner are a glyph and
the word, “cynapicatly,” which seems to indicate an indigenous artist, perhaps with a
Nahuat background (Arq. Carlos Rugerio, personal communication 1998).
The second drawing depicts José de Escandón and three figures that greatly
resemble those from the first drawing, except they all have Christian names: Juan
Serrano, Pedro Arias, and Joseph Peres Lozano (Figure 8). The caption, “Aquí se
demuestra como el Conde de Sierra Gorda repartió los solares a las 27 familias
fundadoras de Mier,” can be translated, “This demonstrates how José de Escandón,
Count of the Sierra Gorda, distributed town lots to the 27 founding families of Mier”
(author’s translation). The above three names are not among any version of the list of
pobladores for Mier, and may actually represent the Christian names adopted by
converted Indians. If this is indeed the case, then it is interesting that Indians were

included in the distribution of town lots instead of with the porciones set aside for the
mission in 1767. The graphic style of the elements that tie each depicted individual to
property suggests a non-European artist (Arq. Carlos Rugerio, personal communication
1998).
Named Indian Groups
The following descriptions concentrate on the groups associated with the
mission Purísima Concepción at Mier, including the Malagueros (aka Malaguitas or
Malahuecos), Garzas, and Zalayas. These three groups, all of which were native to an
area between Cerralvo and the Río Grande, are consistently associated with the mission
at Mier before 1790 (Salinas 1990:157-158). Between 1790 and 1818, other area
Indian groups are mentioned in missionary reports, including Aguichacas, Anda el
Camino, Chinitos, Cotonames, Cueros Quemados, and Pajaritos (Salinas 1990:158).
Two others, the Western and Eastern Carrizos, are included in the discussion because
they were significant cultural groups whose boundary was drawn at Mier. Likewise, the
Guajolotes or Cacalotes are discussed because they were also recorded in the vicinity
of Mier.
Malaguitas or Malahuecos
The Malaguitas or Malahuecos, as they were first recorded, represent one of
the few groups of Indians that it is possible to trace from Nuevo León to the Río
Grande with some certainty (Salinas 1990:46-47). The Malahuecos are identified in
1735 as having attacked Cerralvo and nearby settlements (Salinas 1990:46-47). They
were living between the Río Sabinas and the Río San Juan at that time, not far from
what later became Revilla and Mier (Salinas 1990:47). In 1756 Malaguitas and Garza
Indians are recorded living in the vicinity of Mier, with a combined population of 132
46

(Salinas 1990:47). A year later López de la Cámara Alta mentions both groups as living
near Mier, having encountered 220 people in 50 families (Campbell and Campbell
1985:29; Salinas 1990:47). Most of these Indians lived on the north side of the Río
Grande, but 32 Malaguitas lived on the outskirts of Mier (Salinas 1990:47). The last
mention of the Malaguitas at Mier is in 1772 when their population combined with the
Garzas totaled 85 (Salinas 1990:47). The Malaguitas, mentioned as residents in ten
different missions, continued to migrate along the Río Grande from Coahuila to the Gulf
Coast, where they lived at least until 1812 (Salinas 1990:49). The place name
Malahuecos is still used for an area along the Río Alamo, to the west of Mier.
Garzas
The name Garzas (Spanish for “herons”) was first applied to various groups in
the Cerralvo area as early as 1715, but from 1756 until 1829 the Garzas were reported
living at or near Mier, some on the north bank of the Río Grande (Salinas 1990:96-97).
In 1770 their population at Mier was 101; by 1793 this number was 300, suggesting an
increase by immigration or by absorbing remnants of other groups and not by the natural
result of births (Salinas 1990:97). The Garzas are never recorded east of Mier and
were probably connected to the area between Cerralvo and the Río Grande
communities (Salinas 1990:97).
Zalayas
The Zalayas are mentioned in missionary documents from 1688 in Cerralvo and
again in 1735 as one of the groups that attacked Agualeguas, near Cerralvo (Salinas
1990:113). The one mention of any Zalayas along the Río Grande comes in 1757 when
Margarita, identified as the last of the Zalayas, is reported living with the Garzas in Mier.
She had been baptized in Agualeguas and was serving as the leader of the Garzas. This
47

is the only mention of a woman leader anywhere along the Río Grande (Salinas
1990:113) She lived in the home of Capt. Jose Florencio de Chapa so he could better
subjugate the Garzas (Guerra 1989:23). Francisco is another leader mentioned for the
Garzas at this time (Guerra 1989:23). Instead of being contradictory, the situation may
be that the Garzas and other indigenous groups had distinct war leaders and political
leaders. Among the vocabulary Albert Gatschet (1891) collected for the Comecrudo
language are words for at least two kinds of leaders (Swanton 1940:76, 92 as cited in
Salinas 1990:130). This is also supported by a comment made by Escondón that the
leaders of the Indian groups had authority only in times of war (1798:1-5; as cited in
Salinas 1990:130).
Aguichacas
Missionary reports also contain information about groups that did not enter a
mission, but were located nearby, such as the Aguichacas. This group is mentioned in
various reports between 1790 and 1814 as living near Reynosa and Mier (Salinas
1990:31). Salinas (1990:31) suggests that this group was native to the area even though
their group name does not appear in earlier reports.
Anda el Camino
The Anda el Camino is another group mentioned in missionary reports from
Mier dating to between 1809 and 1818, and from Reynosa between 1797 and 1816
(Salinas 1990:32). Their name is Spanish for “the wanderers,” and they were noted for
frequently visiting the towns and ranching settlements (Salinas 1990:32).
Chinitos
“Chinitos” is a Spanish diminutive form of the name for Chinese, however, it is
not likely that this group represented a Chinese-Indian population (Salinas 1990:95).
48

This group is mentioned only in late missionary documents from between 1790 and
1818, when they are reported living near Revilla and supporting themselves by hunting
(Salinas 1990:95). They probably represent the merging remnants of several groups
from the Cerralvo area (Salinas 1990:95).
Cotonames
The Cotonames were first recorded living near Mier in 1757 by López de la
Cámara Alta. They were also associated with the La Sal del Rey deposits in modern
Hidalgo County, Texas (Salinas 1990:40). In later decades this group was affiliated with
Reynosa, while their association with the salt deposits remains constant (Salinas
1990:40-41). Cotonames are linked to Mier and Reynosa by various documents from
between 1808 and 1831, although their population is evidently declining (Salinas
1990:42). Based on linguistic data, the Cotonames and another local group called the
Eastern Carrizos or Yué are either the same group or two distinct groups that shared the
same language (Salinas 1990:42-43).
Cueros Quemados
Cueros Quemados (Spanish for “burned skins”) are first mentioned in 1735 in
connection to attacks in the Cerralvo area, but later documents place the group on both
banks of the Río Grande between Revilla and Camargo (Salinas 1990:96). In 1750
Escandón counted 33 Cueros Quemados (10 men and 23 women and children), who
he reported were born and raised opposite Camargo on the north bank of the Río
Grande where the Río San Juan joins it, or modern Starr County (Salinas 1990:96).
Two years later the group is congregated at Camargo’s mission along with six other
groups (Salinas 1990:96). By 1757 the Cueros Quemados population at Camargo is
down to 23 (6 men and 17 women and children) and they are noted to travel upstream
49

as far as Revilla (Salinas 1990:96). The last references to the Cueros Quemados are
during the 1790s in Camargo and Mier (Salinas 1990:96).
Pajaritos
Pajaritos is Spanish for “little birds,” and this name was applied to Indian groups
in various areas, but here it refers to a group that was first recorded by Alonso de León
in the Río San Juan valley (Salinas 1990:102). The Pajaritos were reported in 1735 to
have been involved with the attacks on the Cerralvo area, but in 1748 they are reported
as frequent and peaceful visitors to Cerralvo (Salinas 1990:102). Six men and 11
women and children of this same group entered the mission at Camargo in 1751
(Salinas 1990:103). By 1757 their numbers at the mission had grown to 56 (19 men
and 37 women and children), obviously not the result of natural population increase due
to births, but rather migration (Salinas 1990:103). This group continues to be recorded
at Camargo’s mission until at least 1809. They are also reported up the Río Grande as
far as Mier between 1790 and 1818 (Salinas 1990:103).
Western Carrizos
Carrizos, Spanish for “reeds” or “canes,” is a name that was applied to various
Indian groups spread over a wide geographical area, probably none of which were
related by anything else than the type of shelter they built: a frame covered with reeds or
canes (Campbell and Campbell 1985:62-63; Salinas 1990:91). The Carrizos in the
Mier area lived on both sides of the Río Grande and can be divided into Western
Carrizo and Eastern Carrizo, with the boundary between the two falling roughly at Mier
(Salinas 1990:91-92). In 1728 Carrizos appear on a map on the north bank of the Río
Grande near its intersection with the Río Alamo, or in present-day Zapata and Starr
counties (Alvarez Barreiro 1729, map, 1730, 108-118; Wheat 1957, 82-84, map
50

115c; as cited in Salinas 1990:92). Also called Tusan in some mission registers, the
Western Carrizos were referred to by the Garza Indian group as Yemé (Salinas
1990:92-93). A sampling of their language, collected by Jean Louis Berlandier between
1826 and 1834, is related to the Comecrudo language (Goddard 1979:370-371, 378381; as cited in Salinas 1990:93). Few cultural traits were noted for the Western
Carrizos, but we do know that they looked for work at Dolores in 1754 and brought
animal hides there to trade in 1757 (Salinas 1990:92). A few of the foods they ate were
recorded in 1768, including maguey bulbs, snakes, rabbits, and rats (Salinas 1990:92).
Eastern Carrizos
The Eastern Carrizos were associated with the salt deposits in modern Hidalgo
County when they were first recorded in 1757 as living near the Gulf coast (Salinas
1990:93). Later documents associate the group with the area on the north bank from
Camargo to the Gulf coast, where they hunted, fished, and collected wild plant foods
(Salinas 1990:94). The Eastern Carrizos, called Yué by other Indian groups, spoke a
language that is related to the Cotoname language (Goddard 1979:369-371, 377-380;
as cited in Salinas 1990:94).
Guajolotes or Cacalotes
The Guajolotes or Cacalotes (Nahuatl for “turkeys” or “ravens”) are names
given to several Indian groups by the Spaniards. The Guajolotes were recorded in 1750
as one of six groups in the area around Camargo with Blas de Santa María as their
leader (Campbell and Campbell 1985:62; Salinas 1990:45). After 1752 no mention is
made of this group, instead a similar name of Cacalotes appears. Salinas (1990:45)
suggests that either one name replaced the other for the same group, or that the
Guajolotes may have lost their ethnic identity and the name Cacalotes refers to a distinct
51

group. López de la Cámara Alta is the first to use Cacalotes in his 1757 inspection
report to describe a group in the vicinity of Camargo and Revilla, with some members
living near the salt deposits (Salinas 1990:45).
Cultural Summary of the Indigenous Population of the Region
In 1747 Escandón estimated the Indian population south of the Río Grande at
2,500 families or about 7,500 individuals. The largest group, the Comecrudos, both
fished and hunted deer and birds with bows and arrows. The Spaniards were struck by
their dress, or lack thereof, enough to note that while the men wore no clothing, the
women wore skirts made of animal skins or grass (Salinas 1990:29). Smoke signals
were used to communicate with surrounding groups when the Comecrudos’ political
leader wanted to announce a meeting with Escandón (Salinas 1990:29). Later analysis
of the Comecrudo language would show separate terms for political leaders and war
leaders (Swanton 1940:76, 92 as cited in Salinas 1990:130).
The two most common forms of indigenous architecture were the square
ramada, or brush arbor which provided a roof and perhaps one or two walls; and the
round frame covered with reeds or canes, which was associated not only with the
Carrizo Indians, but also the Garzas and Malaguitas or Malahuecos. Neither type
structure offered a complete enclosure.
Early reports note the prevalence of tattooing among the Indian groups known
from Mier and surrounding communities. In the San Antonio missions, “Borrado,” which
apparently referred to heavily tattooed people, was applied as a generic term to Indians
from various groups along the Lower Río Grande Valley. Men restricted their tatoos to
their faces, but women wore tattoos on their faces and their bodies. Tattooing practices
among various groups must have been similar as membership in a particular group was
52

not evident to observers based on tattooed designs alone.
Very few specific animals that were hunted by Indians were recorded by
Spanish observers, however, it is thought that deer was the prinicipal game animal,
followed by the peccary (Campbell 1998: 51; Salinas 1990:115). Smaller animals
hunted include rabbits, rats, mice, turkey, birds in general, and snakes (Salinas
1990:116). In later times, wild horses and the colonists’ livestock were also preyed
upon (Salinas 1990:116).
As hunters and gatherers, Indian groups practiced seasonal migration, travelling
to different areas according to a schedule of harvest. They may have used canoes or
travelled by foot using a system of trails (Salinas 1990:128). Sandals made of leather
were used to protect the feet from thorns, although numerous references suggest Indians
were often barefoot (Campbell 1998: 51; Salinas 1990:129).
Pobladores undoubtedly learned the most about native plants from Indians.
Edible seeds, berries, and plants that were favorites of the Indians became part of the
colonists’ diet, including mesquite beans, prickly pear fruit, ebony seeds, wild cucumber,
and chili peppers (Campbell 1998: 51; González 1998:79). Knowledge of medicinal
herbs, barks, leaves, roots and seeds was also learned from the Indians. For example,
juice extracted from mesquite leaves was used to treat pink eye, while a tea from the
seeds of the wild olive plant was used as a cough medicine (González 1998:77).
Colonial documents record a few herbal remedies, including treating fevers with a tea
from cenizilla leaves and using ebony seeds as purgatives (Salinas 1990:134).
Herbal medicine as practiced by the Indian groups of the area did not help them
defend against diseases brought by the Europeans, such as syphillis, smallpox, and
measles (Salinas 1990:134, 140). Epidemics repeatedly ravaged the indigenous
53

populations, in one case reducing the number of Indian families at Camargo in 1749
from 37 to 15 families (Salinas 1990:140).
Indian attacks on communities of Nuevo León were common until the last
decades of the eighteenth century (Jones 1979:37). These attacks were a consequence
of slave-hunting expeditions as early as the 1580s, followed by the harsh treatement of
indigenous people and their forced resettlement into congregaciones, or Indian villages,
by Governor Martín Zavala (Jones 1979:36). Incessant attacks by Indians also
characterized the settlements of Nuevo Santander, epecially during the second half of
the eighteenth century when many colonists were killed or injured and large numbers of
livestock were run off (Jones 1979:77). The prevalence of attack is reflected in the
area’s architecture, for example by 1786 a fortaleza, or fort was completed at Los
Corralitos, near Dolores (Fleming and Perttula 1999:395). The threat of Indian attack
continued into the nineteenth century. Laredo’s 1819 census documents the
abandonment of 37 of its 54 ranchos because of raids by Indians (Jones 1979:77).
The Sale and Adoption of Indian Children
There are a few accounts of Indian children being sold to pobladores in
exchange for domesticated animals and other goods (Salinas 1990:39, 52, 120, 130).
The sale of children is one factor proposed by Salinas (1990:140) for the decline in
Indian population:
“In the late eighteenth century, particularly along the lower Río Grande,
discouraged parents sometimes sold children to Spaniards to become
servants and laborers. This was common enough at the time to warrant
a viceregal investigation (Riperdá 1772; Cabello 1780; Evia
1968:165)”
54

Genealogical research has revealed that some of the pobladores of Mier
adopted Indian children (Galindo 1999:38-39). For example, Gaspar García and
Gertrudis Barrera, who received Mier Porción 1, adopted three children: a son and two
daughters. The baptismal records for both daughters state they are adopted Indians
(SAGA publications 1989). Their first adopted daughter, María Josefa García, was
baptized January 3, 1769. She died on March 21, 1781.
The second adopted daughter, María Antonia García, was baptized February
25, 1770. She married Jose Pablo Leal on May 20, 1800. That year they appear on
the census for Mier, living at the family’s Rancho de Guardado (Overstreet 1990:68).
Both of them are listed as though they are a part of a household headed by her brother,
José Antonio García and his wife Gertrúdiz Flores. I do not know the actual date when
the census was taken, therefore, it is impossible to tell if they are married yet.
That Pablo Leal is listed as part of Antonio García’s family would seem to
indicate that he was a workman living with the family. That Antonia García, daughter
(albeit adopted) of one of the most prominent families in Mier, would marry a workman
and not the son of a landowner (like most of her siblings), seems to indicate that she did
not have the same status as the natural children of Gaspar García and Gertrudis Barrera
or his later wife Guadalupe Flores. If Antonia García and Pablo Leal are in fact married
when they appear on the 1800 census, then their placement with her brother’s family
also suggests they did not enjoy the same status or independence as other married
couples. Pablo Leal died on December 1, 1812, at age 39. Antonia García lived to be
at least 76 years old, dying on December 9, 1846. She does not reside at Rancho de
Guardado when the 1817 census is taken (Galindo 1999:99-102) and apparently she
and Pablo did not have children. Pablo’s parents were José Toribio Leal and María
55

Petra Palacios, who baptized one child in Cerralvo in 1763 and three others in
Camargo between 1770 and 1773.
Conclusion
The information presented here about Indian groups is from colonial government
and mission reports. Clearly a number of various indigenous groups populated the
frontier along the Río Grande at the time of the arrival of the pobladores and continued
to co-exist at least through the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Large numbers of
indigenous people undoubtedly died from disease or physical violence with the
colonists. However, through the social mechanisms of marriage, adoption, and religious
conversion at least some indigenous people were incorporated or assimilated
themselves into colonial society. They also contributed their knowledge, physical labor
and creative energies on the ranches and toward the construction of Mier’s church on
the main plaza (Figure 9). Certain carved elements such as the floral motifs in the stone
around the church’s entrance suggest an artist of indigenous descent (Arq. Carlos
Rugerio, personal communication 1998). Although specific contributions by indigenous
individuals may be difficult to pinpoint because of a lack of documentation, this chapter
demonstrates that even though some questions about the indigenous population cannot
be answered, it is still informative to pose the questions and glean as much as possible
from the available information.

Chapter 3
Mining Community Origins of Nuevo Santander Colonists
Introduction
A majority of the Nuevo Santander colonists who arrived at the Spanish frontier
in 1753 and became farmers and ranchers in Mier, Tamaulipas, heralded from the
nearby mining community of Cerralvo, Nuevo León. This chapter examines the
ethnicities of the population and compares the geography, natural resources, and
economies between Mier and Cerralvo to better understand the pobladores’ processes
of adapting to the ranchos along the Lower Río Grande. It explores how the settlement
at Mier reflected both continuities with, and variation from, settlement in Cerralvo.
Cattle and a distinct herding method are traced through Cerralvo to Mier, establishing
the invaluable contributions made by Nuevo Santander colonists to the nineteenthcentury Anglo cattle industry.
The two settlements are in distinct environmental zones—Cerralvo is in the
foothills of the Sierra Madres Oriental, whereas, Mier, although only 60 kilometers to
the northeast, is located at the confluence of two rivers in the Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure
1 on page 7). Cerralvo’s economy developed in large part because of its mineral
wealth, while farming and ranching were the principle industries of Mier.
The colony of Nuevo Santander is not usually included when scholars consider
the Spanish colonial influence in Texas (Bolton 1921, Tjarks 1997, Yoakum 1935).
Thus, the colony of Nuevo Santander is not usually considered part of Texas history,
despite the 24 porciones of Mier on the north bank of the Río Grande that were officially recognized by Texas as the legal property of the descendents of Nuevo Santander
colonists in accordance with the terms of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Until

58

recent decades (Alonzo 1998, Bonine 2001, Chipman 1992, Fleming 1998, Fleming
and Pertulla 1999, George 1975, Jackson 1986, Jones 1979, Montejano 1987,
Perttula, et. al., 1999), the contributions of Nuevo Santander ranchers have gone
ignored, despite the debt owed to these early vaqueros by the nineteenth-century Anglo
cattle industry. Land was granted to colonists on both banks of the Lower Río Grande
from Laredo to Brownsville. Therefore, this study is also undertaken to supplement
Texas history, specifically, in Starr County, which includes about one-third of the total
land granted by the Spanish Crown to the inhabitants of Mier.
I begin by setting the context with a brief review of the history of the founding of
Mier, followed by a summary of the early history of Cerralvo containing information
about the economy, natural resources, demography, and climate of the area. In turn, I
offer a more indepth look at Mier’s population and rancho settlements and provide an
analysis of the continuities in lifeways between the two communities.
Mier, Tamaulipas
Mier grew out of the ranch headquarters of José Felix de Almondoz that was
formed in 1734 by 166 people in 19 families (Casteñada 1976:171; Graham 1994:19).
It was originally called El Paso del Cántaro and located 8 leagues northwest of
Camargo. When Camargo was established in 1749 these 19 families were forced to
enroll as settlers of that community or be driven off their land (Casteñada 1976:171).
These same families would form the core of the population of Mier in 1753, when the
town was renamed and organized as part of Nuevo Santander. Mier was the site of an
easy ford of the Río Grande and also had high-quality limestone beds for construction
material (Scott 1937:81). It was primarily a ranching community, but also enjoyed good

59

commerce with Nuevo León, where many settlers had their origins and maintained
connections (Scott 1937:81).
Cerralvo, Nuevo León
Thirty-eight of the 57 families who settled Mier were from Cerralvo. Although
relatively close together, the towns are in distinct ecotones that are dominated by the
Río Grande and the piedmont region of the Sierra Madres Oriental, respectively.
Cerralvo’s history reflects its birth as a mining community, whereas the set of resources
available in Mier did not include minerals suitable for mining. Despite these significant
differences, much continuity with Cerralvo is evident in the settlement of Mier, especially
with regards to cattle herding and livestock raising.
Cerralvo was founded April 20, 1582, by Don Luís de Carvajal y de la Cueva,
who christened it Cuidad de León (Hoyo 1962; León 1986:18; Contreras López
1999:29). In this same area before 1577, Alberto del Canto had established Las Minas
de San Gregorio (Hoyo 1962; León 1986:18). In 1626 don Martín de Zavala renamed
León, San Gregoria de Cerralvo (Hoyo 1962; León 1986:18). These multiple place
names reflect the difficulty in sustaining frontier populations and the need to periodically
revitalize the settlements. Cerralvo is located in the foothills of the Sierra Madres
Oriental near where two geological formations, Midway and Mendez, come together
(Hayward 1965:9). The Midway formation is characterized by shale with some
interbedded lenses and layers of sandstone and limestone, with conglomeratic beds in
some areas at the base (Hayward 1965:8). The Mendez formation is gray to blue gray
shales in compact but poorly bedded layers with a few thin calcareous sandstone beds
(Hayward 1965:9). To the south-southwest of Cerralvo are the Sierra de los Picachos
or the Cerralvo Mountains, where many of the area mines are located (Hayward
60

1965:9). The silver and lead mines are dug into lower Cretaceous limestone and have
through the centuries produced more than 50 million dollars of ore, although production
has dropped significantly since 1955 (Hayward 1965:9). Cerralvo would have attracted
a labor force of free and enslaved workers to its mines. This would have likely included
Indians, Blacks, mestizos, and mulattos. No doubt, penisulares and criollos were also
attracted to Cerralvo as a frontier mining town with potential for wealth, but they were
likely the minority of population. A lack of demographic data for Cerralvo precludes
further inferences, however, the preceeding assumptions seem reasonable, given the
following statistics for Zacatecas as cited by Herrera Casasús (1998):
“Pero volviendo al siglo XVIII, hemos visto que había muchos esclavos
negros laborando en las minas del país. Tan solo en las minas de
Zacatecas, por 1570, había 300 españoles y más de 500 esclavos
(Archivo General de la Nación (AGN), Inquisición, 813, 6, as cited in
Aguirre Beltran 1940:211). En 1608 en la misma ciudad habitaban 300
españoles peninsulares, 1200 criollos, pero ‘los indios y negros son en
mayor número porque entre unos y otros habrá 3000 con mestizos y
mulatos’ (AGN, Inquisición, 786, 4, as cited in Aguirre Beltran
1940:211). Muchos de los mulatos cimarrones y libres se acomodaron
en las minas de las provincias del norte, in las haciendas y en las
congregas” (Herrera Casasús 1998:45).
Author’s translation:
By the eighteenth century there had been many black slaves toiling in the
mines of New Spain. For example, in the mines of Zacatecas in 1570,
there were 300 españoles and more than 500 slaves (Archivo General
de la Nación, Inquisición, 813, 6, as cited in Aguirre Beltran 1940:211).
In 1608 in the same city there were 300 peninsulares, 1200 criollos,
with Indians and Blacks in the majority at 3,000 including mestizos and
mulattos (Archivo General de la Nación, Inquisición, 786, 4, as cited in
Aguirre Beltran 1940:211). Many of the runaway and free mulattos
worked in the mines, the haciendas, and in the congregas of the
northern provinces (Herrera Casasús 1998:45).

Eighteenth-century Cerralvo was described as having a fair amount of silver,
abundant lead and some copper, as well as the necessary infrastructure in the form of
grinding mills to process the ore (León 1961:348). As mentioned previously, Cerralvo’s
early existence was as a mining community, which, in turn, was a consequence of
Spain’s initial exploration and settlement strategy for New Spain, based on mineral
resources. The mountains surrounding Cerralvo were also sources of stones for construction, such as the marble quarried from nearby El Cerro del Topo for use in building
facades for houses in Monterrey (Montemayor Hernández 1971:16). Additionally,
Cerralvo is described as being relatively safe from attack by the Indian tribes in the area
(León 1961:348). This description is curious because it contradicts one of the motivations usually cited for the establishment of Nuevo Santander, namely the threat of attack
by Indians on mining communities (Myers 1969:18; George 1975:7, 27). Likely, the
threat of attack by nearby indigenous tribes was a topic stressed when requesting
governmental assistance, but qualified in other instances, such as when promoting
settlement.
Although archival sources do not quantify the Indian population, as many as 70
indigenous tribes are listed for the Cerralvo area (Montemayor Hernández 1971:31).
The names most likely represent those imposed by the Spanish, but there is a possibility
that some—like los guajolotes (parrots), los garzas (cranes), or los amapolas (poppies)—may represent actual clan names (Montemayor Hernández 1971:33). The
Spanish lumped these tribes of the North together as Chichimec, according to Aztec
tradition. They were largely hunters and gatherers, who relied mainly on deer, but also
fish and bear, depending on the local conditions (Montemayor Hernández 1971:32).
Among these indigenous people the Spanish noted a division of labor along gender lines
62

and a lack of private property (Montemayor Hernández 1971:32-33).
The climate of Cerralvo is a function of its location in the foothills of the Sierra
Madres Oriental at their confluence with the Gulf Coastal Plains (Montemayor
Hernández 1971:16). The summers are frequently excessively hot, while the winters can
be cold. From July to September there is a period of heavy rains and flooding, while in
February and March come cold fronts known as Nortes (Montemayor Hernández
1971:18). The vegetation varies according to hydrology, orography, and climate from
prickly pear cactus and mesquite to conifers and pasture lands (Montemayor
Hernández 1971:18). One of the jewels of Cerralvo and likely one of the main attractions for settlement, besides the area’s mineral wealth, is its natural spring. Today it is the
site of a national park. Named for the huge cypress trees that surround it, Parque El
Sabinal is an incredible place. The cool water and the abundant shade easily take 20
degrees off the hottest summer day.
Cerralvo, while it owed its existence to the presence of mineral resources, was
also a community that was active in agriculture and ranching. The seventeenth-century
historian Juan Díez de la Calle noted the abundance of water in and around Cerralvo
and its peaceful countryside (León 1986:25). The settlement was located amongst
numerous pastures and fertile lands that produced every kind of cultivated crops,
including fruit trees and melons (León 1961:83). Eventually, the tribes that migrated
through the area became increasingly hostile and a military detachment was established
that reduced the tribes’ population, while some individuals became integrated into
Cerralvo’s population (León 1961:83). Here a contradiction arises, in that descriptions
of eighteenth-century Cerralvo emphasize a scarcely populated frontier, where presumably interracial marriages were more likely to occur. Yet, simultaneously there exists the
63

“myth” that the Nuevo Santander settlers of the North were distinct from their central
and southern Mexican counterparts in that they did not intermarry with the indigenous
population to the same extent (León 1986:26). The reasons given include the greater
animosity that existed between the colonists and the Indians in the North, and differences between mobile versus sedentary indigenous communities (León 1986:26).
Clearly Cerralvo would have required a substantial labor force to exploit her mineral
wealth, and these laborers would likely have been Indians, Blacks, mestizos, and
mulattos. Demographic data for Cerralvo are lacking; however, there is evidence in
Mier for a substantial population of afromestizos during the eighteenth century (Herrera
Casasús 1998).
To summarize, Cerralvo was a mining and cattle community located at the
juncture of the mountains and the coastal plain that had sufficient water sources to
support the industry, agriculture, and husbandry of the settlement. The climate can be
harsh, but for the most part the rains are beneficial, rather than destructive, and provide
varied and abundant vegetation, which in turn supports wild and domesticated animals.
For much of its early history the community was sparsely populated and its residents
were likely multi-ethnic. Initially, there was a significant indigenous population that was
slowly either decimated or integrated into español society.
At this point, I return to a discussion of Mier that will lend itself to comparison
with the above data about Cerralvo.
Pobladores of Nuevo Santander
Despite prospects of certain hardship, Nuevo Santander colonists were attracted to the frontier by the economic opportunities it offered. Each family was given
between 100 and 200 pesos, a houselot on which to build, pasture lands, and agricul64

tural land, with provisions for the construction of irrigation canals and wells, as well as
for initial supplies of grain (Herrera Casasús 1998:27). These families, then, were
motivated in great part by ambitions for a better life. The money offered the settlers
would have been enough for a slave to buy his or her freedom, for example, and allow
them to participate in the opportunities of the frontier, not the least of which was the
chance to own land (Herrera Casasús 1998:46). Mier was founded without cost to the
crown; however, its pobladores did receive land grants.
The practice of enslaving prisoners of war continued longer on the sparselypopulated frontier than in the more heavily-populated areas of New Spain after being
officially abolished by the Crown (Zavala 1965:43). Indians taken prisoners in northern
Tamaulipas were transported in shackles to México City via San Luis Potosi and
ultimately sent as labor reinforcements to Veracruz and La Habana during the second
half of the eighteenth century (Herrera Casasús 1998:26).
The ethnicities of the Mier pobladores are often left out of secondary sources.
Of the many publications that duplicate the 1753 census, I was able to locate only one
that retained the ethnic designations. Even so, only one couple was specifically identified
as “españoles” and only one individual was identified as “mestiza.” The 1753 census
also enumerates about 36 un-named servants and their family members. As previously
stated, the families who were already living in the area when neighboring Camargo was
established were forced to register with that settlement or risk losing their property. The
Camargo census of 1749 contains casta designations for 16 individuals who also appear
on the 1753 census for Mier. All of them are “españoles.”
Of the 103 named persons in the 1753 census for Mier, all 36 adult names
appear with the titles, “Don” or “Doña” with the exception of four (Herrera Pérez
65

1986:99-101). These titles are usually associated with españoles. They may also be
used to refer to older people, regardless of ethnicity; however, in this case most of the
pobladores were younger people. Considering the use of titles, together with the casta
designations known from the 1749 Camargo census, it seems reasonable to assume that
most of the pobladores were españoles. The four people who do not receive these titles
are: José Bazán Pardo and Ana Salinas, who was identified as a mestiza, their son
Joaquín Bazán Pardo, and Alonso García Lugo, a soldier with the Royal Squadron.
Joaquín Bazán Pardo was married to Doña Manuela González and he received
Mier Porción 34. In the 1767 listing of porciones he is referred to simply as Joaquín
Bazán (Herrera Pérez 1986:113). It is possible that “Pardo” was a family name, but it is
equally possible that it is a casta designation which means the offspring of an español
and a Black (Barnes et. al. 1981:92). This possibility seems more likely, especially given
the absence of the “Don” title in the census and the absence of “Pardo” in the context of
land granting.
José Bazán Pardo was married to the mestiza Ana Salinas and he received Mier
Porción 40. His death record states that he was from Cerralvo. Similar to Joaquín’s
case, the “Pardo” designation associated with José disappears in the 1767 listing of
porciones. Casta categories are not evident in the marriage records of José and Ana’s
four children (SAGA publications 1989); however they surface in the next generation
when their grandson Norberto Bazán and his bride Ignacia Bazán are labeled “mulato”
and “mulata,” respectively, in their marriage record of November 8, 1809 (Figure 10;
Galindo 1999:25). Ignacia’s parents were José Seberiano Bazán and María Gregoria
Tanguma who were married in Mier on January 20, 1792.
The soldier Alonso García Lugo was married to Doña Tomasa de la Garza, but

Figure 10: The José Bazán Pardo and María Ana Salinas family, including one third-generation marriage that illustrates the assignment of
casta categories (SAGA publications 1989; Galindo 1999:26).

I was unable to locate any baptismal, marriage, or death records for either of them in
Mier or Camargo. His name is not among the porcion recipients.
An analysis of ethnicities as registered in the baptismal records for Mier between 1767-1804 demonstrates that the majority of inhabitants were español, or at
least registered that way (Herrera Casasús 1998:59). In general, the shortage of
peninsulares meant that children of legitimate marriages between español men and
Indians, Blacks, or mestizo women produced children that were classified as españoles;
while the illegitimate children of español men and Indians, Blacks, or mestizo women
were classified as mestizo (Herrera Casasús 1998:60). Maria Luisa Herrera Casasús
(1998:59-60) analyzed about 75% of the baptismal records from Mier between 17671789 and documented 388 births that breakdown as follows in Table 5:

It is significant that despite no births of Black children being recorded between
1767 and 1789, the Black population of Mier was 102 in 1788. This growth may be
the result of migration, or, if Blacks were not Catholic, they may not have registered
their children with the Catholic Church. Also significant is the 42% of Mier’s population
that is either Black or afromestizo in 1788. We cannot know for certain what the Black
population in Mier was between 1753 and 1767 unless more census data are located.
There may have been Blacks among the servants who were not identified in the 1753
census. The 1788 census stands as an anomaly with respect to the Black population of
Mier without casta information for the ensuing years. Sixty-five years later we know that
Mier’s population is recorded as 5,082 with no Blacks or afromestizos registered
(Herrera Casasús 1998:71).
Thus, we catch a glimpse of an emerging Black population on the frontier that is
somehow integrated into the mestizo or español categories to the point of disappearing

69

in about a century’s time. The exact mechanism of this transformation remains unclear
until census data including casta designations for 1788-1853 are located. However,
some general conclusions can be drawn from the proliferation of casta categories during
the eighteenth century. Intermarriage among people of different casta categories meant
that terms had to be created to describe their children. Also during the eighteenth
century, the practice of importing slaves from Africa or from slave traders in the Antilles
into New Spain had just about been abandoned because the mulatto population offered
a ready supply of cheap manual labor (Herrera Casasús 1998:5-6). “The division of
castas, through mestizaje, or racial mixing, was erasing the visible barrier of skin color
and somatic characteristics, therefore diminishing segregation somewhat” (Herrera
Casasús 1998:5-6 (author’s translation)).
Blacks likely intermarried with españoles, Indians, and mestizos to the point
where in dress and appearance (skin color, hair texture, language, etc.) their descendants became classified as mestizo or español. The low population density of Nuevo
Santander favored the rapid mestizaje of the population and opened the way for the
resultant mestizos to ascend the social scale (Herrera Casasús 1998:46). After all, on
the frontier privileges usually reserved for peninsulares or criollos, like owning property,
carrying a weapon, and riding a horse, became available to the pobladores in exchange
for their population and defense of the frontier, regardless of their race or ethnic backgrounds. Gonzalo Aguirre Beltran (1972:273) cites the text of an eighteenth-century
ordinance, which found it necessary to explain that in the towns of Nuevo Santander the
population was not all Indian. The ordinance noted lighter skin color as well as the
manner of dress and the use of the Spanish language as factors that distinguished some

70

Indians as españoles (León 1924:27 as cited in Aguirre Beltran 1972:273).
The information about the ethnicities of the pobladores presented in this section
will be explored more deeply in the next chapter; however, at this point it is important to
note that one of the major continuities between Cerralvo and Mier is population. As a
mining community, Cerralvo probably had a significant percentage of Indians, Blacks,
indomestizos, and afromestizos in its population. No doubt many of these people would
be attracted to Mier and the other Nuevo Santander settlements along the lower Río
Grande. The lack of comprehensive census data for the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries makes it difficult to quantify the casta population; however, their presence must
not be ignored.
Los Ranchos de Mier
The ranch as a social institution has its beginning in Spain as early as the eleventh or twelfth centuries. Gregorio de Villalobos is credited with bringing the first cattle
to the Southern Veracruz Gulf Coast about 1521 from the Antilles (Doolittle 1987:4;
Sluyter 1996:164). The descendents of the Villalobos herd were moved into the Valley
of México and eventually populated the entire central highlands (Doolittle 1987:4).
The first cattle in northern New Spain, however, were brought by Don Luís
Carvajal y de la Cueva to Cerralvo from the Pánuco basin of southern Tamaulipas and
northern Veracruz (Doolittle 1987). When Carvajal arrived in 1582 he established
Ciudad de León (now Cerralvo, N.L.) at the site of the abandoned Las Minas de San
Gregorio (Contreras López 1999:28-29). The cattle that Carvajal brought were not
descendents of the Villalobos herd, but rather from a herd imported in 1527 for the
soldier-colonists at Santisteban de Pánuco (Doolittle 1987:4). These soldiers had been
left in 1522 by Hernán Cortés and by the time Governor Beltran Nuño de Guzmán
71

considered their request for cattle and horses, they were impoverished and nearly
destitute (Doolittle 1987:4).
A large percentage of these soldiers were from the Las Marismas, a wetland
area in Spain along the lower Río Guadalquivir of Andalusia, where horse-mounted
vaqueros practiced the seasonal movement of cattle between wetlands and hill lands
(Butzer 1988, Jordan 1993, Sluyter 1996:161-162, 164). The Pánuco soldier-colonists
traded locally-acquired Huastecan Indian slaves for cattle and horses from the Antilles
and are credited with introducing the open-range herding system into México (Chipman
1967:157, 198-99; Doolittle 1987:4).
Carvajal received an encomienda and a royal commission to conquer, colonize,
and govern a region known as Nuevo Reyno de León that emcompassed about
1,614,000 km2 (Contreras López 1999:233). Carvajal was required as part of his grant
agreement to herd cattle from the Pánuco region and establish a livestock-raising
industry (Alessio Robles 1938:101-109 and Reyes 1944:33 as cited in Doolittle
1987:7). His greatest contribution was not the cattle, however, but the horses and a
herding technique, unique in New Spain, that involved rounding up feral or semi-feral
cattle from horseback (Doolittle 1987:7).
The descendents of Carvajal’s herd were most likely moved to the Río Grande
along with Nuevo Santander colonists. They would eventually be known as Texas
Longhorns (Graham 1994:12). Thus, the system of cattle ranching that sustained the
eighteenth-century colonial settler in Nuevo Santander, and that would develop during
the latter half of the nineteenth century into a complex capitalist venture by Anglo
ranchers in Texas, was an extension of the system that the Spanish imported and
adapted to the New World. It was a method that developed along the coast of New
72

Spain using horse-mounted vaqueros, or cowboys, and dogs to manage cattle herds for
long-distance grazing, periodic roundups, branding, and long-distance cattle drives
(Graham 1994:9,10). Herded, branded cattle in Spain commonly co-existed with wild,
unclaimed stock on unfenced ranges (Graham 1994:9). These are all characteristics of
the ranching method adopted by Nuevo Santander colonists.
The ranch was a means for controlling vast areas of unoccupied land with few
settlers (Myers 1969:8). Whereas cattle ranching on the coast of New Spain involved
huge herds of cattle exclusively that were managed by horse-mounted vaqueros,
livestock raising on the Meseta Central in Spain involved smaller herds of mainly sheep
and goats, but also a few cattle (William Doolittle, personal communication 2003).
These mixed herds also characterized livestock raising in Nuevo Santander.
According to a census conducted in 1757 by Don José Tienda de Cuervo, Mier
had 274 inhabitants and a total of 44,015 livestock, including horses, cattle, burros,
mules, sheep, and goats (Myers 1969:15, 60). The entire colony, according to the same
census, had 80,000 ganado major (horses, mules, and cattle), and more than 333,000
ganado menor (sheep and goats) (Myers 1969:15). Thus, the number of animals per
capita in Mier in 1757 was 161, and the colonists of Mier controlled approximately
11% of the total livestock of Nuevo Santander at that time. Although smaller, tamer
herds of mixed animals might be successfully tended by herders on foot, the open range
cattle tradition along the lower Río Grande required the use of horse-mounted vaqueros. Apparently the colonists combined the New Spain coastal style of herd management with the strategy adopted from the Spanish Meseta Central to fit their unique
circumstances.
The wealth of Nuevo Santander colonists was comprised primarily of their
73

herds, as cows and cowhides became a medium of exchange and an important economic resource (Myers 1969:8). Trade restrictions imposed by Spain and a lack of
ports hampered the development of the livestock industry, but in addition to the sometimes illegal transactions with the French in Louisiana, colonists drove herds to Nuevo
León, Coahuila, Monterrey, and the Presidio de Río Grande (present-day Eagle Pass)
(Myers 1969:43).
The colony of Nuevo Santander had no presidios and few missions; therefore,
the private ranch became the primary method of settlement for the first 100 years
(Myers 1969:15; Graham 1994:19). Indeed, “the ranch outlasted the mission and the
presidio and became the only great Spanish institution to survive nearly intact into the
modern age” (Myers 1969:56). In this respect Mier is not unique – other contemporary
settlements in the area also grew out of ranch headquarters, including Laredo, Guerrero,
and Matamoros. The later communities of Zapata, Roma/Los Saenz, Garceño, and Río
Grande City also originated as ranch headquarters on early land grants (Graham
1994:19, 22).
After land grants were awarded in 1767 during the General Visit of the Royal
Commission of the Colonies of Nuevo Santander, the new owners were required to
take possession, construct homes on the ranch, mark the boundaries of their property,
and stock the land with animals, in order to validate their land claims (Graham
1994:20,22). Thus, many families who had lived for years in the towns of Camargo,
Revilla, Reynosa, and Mier, now relocated to ranches (Graham 1994:22). The women
and children from those families who could afford it remained in town for amenities such
as the schools, churches, and protection from Indian raids that the towns provided,
while the men of these families spent certain seasons on the ranch (Graham 1994:22).
74

The men of the wealthiest families were able to remain in town and instead sent workers
to the ranch to care for the animals (Graham 1994:22).
Land grants in Camargo, Revilla, Reynosa, and Mier were awarded in 1767 on
both sides of the Río Grande. The river at this time was not a divider of nations, rather,
it existed as one clearly defined geographic entity that served to unite people (George
1975:20; Graham 1994:20). The ranchers who claimed land and maintained herds on
both banks (Graham 1994:20) best exemplify this fact.
Conclusions: Continuities and Variations
The two most salient differences to consider in a discussion of the settlement
patterns of Mier in relation to Cerralvo are the vastly different landscapes and, as a
consequence, the varied natural resources available to their inhabitants. As an industry
dependent on accessible natural mineral resources, mining had an impact on Cerralvo’s
economy that has no corollary in Mier’s history. Mier, on the other hand, was wellsuited for large-scale ranching, which involved cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and mules.
The riverine setting and the alluvial soils provided fertile agricultural lands in Mier,
although the area was subject to seasonal flooding. The Río Grande also provided Mier
a transportation route not available to inland Cerralvo.
Some of the continuities apparent between the two communities include the
agricultural and ranching traditions. The inhabitants of Cerralvo developed agriculture
and ranching to support the mining industry, so that colonial settlers in Mier would likely
have been familiar with, if not proficient at, both classes of activities. Therefore, they
would have been attracted by the availability of land and pasture in Mier. The cattle
brought to Mier were probably descendents of the herd that Carvajal brought to
Cerralvo in the 1580s along with a horse-mounted vaquero style of herd management.
75

Other continuities derive from the exploitation of stone resources. Material for
construction of many of Mier’s homes and buildings was quarried from a hill about 1.5
km from the plaza. The settlers’ familiarity with the hills of Cerralvo, especially El Cerro
del Topo, no doubt aided in their exploitation of the mineral resources around Mier.
The most significant continuity, however, is that of the human population.
Settlers from Cerralvo constituted two-thirds of Mier’s initial population. People of
color and those of mixed-race, above all, would have been attracted to the freedom and
opportunities available in both communities, but more so in Mier because of the
landgrants. On the frontier people could, with relative ease, improve their social castes,
at least on paper, by acting the part. Apparently, mestizos and mulattos who owned land
and property, who dressed like españoles, and spoke Spanish were regarded as
españoles in the official records or their children became españoles when baptized.
Herein lies a dilemma that future research must consider: when scholars locate
the necessary demographic information, how reliable can the racial designations be?
Assuming the foregone to be true, then I suspect census data for the frontier in general
would reveal an exaggerated number of españoles and an undercount of people of
color. We know that both localities were initially surrounded with significant indigenous
populations that were eventually decimated by abuse and conflict or incorporated by
acculturation into español society. We also know, at least in Mier, but likely in Cerralvo
as well, that Blacks, mulattos, and afromestizos formed a substantial part of the population. What continues to elude us are the exact population figures or proportions and the
processes of intergration, acculturation, and/or assimilation. The next chapter attempts
to address some of these issues by taking a more in-depth look at ethnicities among the
colonists.

Chapter 4
Historical Archaeology and Ethnicities Among Nuevo Santander Rancho
Communities in South Texas and Northeastern México
Historical archaeology in South Texas and northeastern México is a nascent
field, one well-positioned to incorporate new ideas, especially with regard to the
following definition. The current trend in historical archaeology is towards a multidisciplinary approach, rooted in anthropology and history, which focuses on illuminating
the daily life of ordinary people, whose lives have been traditionally ignored in academia
(Orser and Fagan 1994). As well, theoretical development has led historical
archaeology to an exploration of subjects such as ethnicity, which had not previously
been attempted through archaeology. It is through this theoretical development that
historical archaeology, as an emerging sub-discipline, has been able to mature with newfound confidence, in part by re-affirming our unique contribution to the greater body of
knowledge, namely the diachronic perspective and the material culture dimensions of
our work. What remains is for historical archaeologists to successfully apply
provocative theoretical stances with equally innovative methodological developments.
Theoretical positions can be difficult to apply to an analysis of the archaeological
record at a given historical site, depending on the kinds of artifacts recovered and the
types of relevant archival material available. This chapter summarizes the current
direction archaeology is taking and compares this trajectory with what has been
accomplished to date by historical archaeologists in the area of South Texas and
northeastern México, where Spanish colonial ranching developed during the eighteenth
century. What follows is a summary of the definition of historical archaeology as put
forth by Charles E. Orser, Jr. and Brian M. Fagan (1994) and an application of their

theoretical concept to the artifacts from the previously mentioned 1951 excavations of
two sites that likely represent a single colonial rancho on a porción associated with
Mier, Tamaulipas, México. Additionally, I challenge several popular myths that persist
about the region involving settlement patterns and the ethnic composition of the
pobladores.
An Emerging Definition of Historical Archaeology
Orser and Fagan’s definition of historical archaeology (1994:14) is based on
three past definitions, from which they construct a new comprehensive one. The first has
its roots in historic preservation and is characterized by the study of a period, such as
classical, medieval, etc. (Orser and Fagan 1994:6-8). It relied on a distinction between
historic and pre-historic that correlated to literate v. non-literate. Further definitions
were developed to describe situations where literate people had contact with and wrote
about non-literate ones.
A second past definition of historic archaeology describes it as a method that
uses diverse sources of information, while incorporating approaches from both history
and anthropology (Orser and Fagan 1994:8-11). Ethnohistory emerges as the study of
the past using non-Western indigenous historical records, and especially, oral tradition.
Ethnohistory often focuses on people who are known to have existed in history but who
are known largely through the writings of outsiders. Oral history is unwritten verbal
history and tradition, often in the form of genealogies and family histories.
The final past definition cited by Orser and Fagan focuses on a specific
historical topic and the concept of a world system. James Deetz (as cited in Orser and
Fagan 1994:11) defines historical archaeology as the “archaeology of the spread of
European culture throughout the world since the fifteenth century and its impact on
78

indigenous people.” The world system of trade, travel, and transportation facilitated the
spread of ideas and people. The variation of settlement in the colonies is considered
proof of the significant influence of indigenous people on the Europeans. Although
Deetz’s definition is considered classical, it is also criticized by Orser and Fagan
(1994:14) for having a Eurocentric perspective.
Historic archaeology, as recently defined by Orser and Fagan, is a
“multidisciplinary field that shares a special relationship with the formal disciplines of
anthropology and history, focuses its attention on the post-prehistoric past, and seeks to
understand the global nature of modern life” (1994:14). They define the term postprehistoric, the opposite of prehistoric, to signify “that the world was a different place
after Europeans took Western culture to various places on the globe,” but without
privileging literacy or giving it a primary role in shaping recent history (Orser and Fagan
1994:19). They suggest that the focus on the global nature of modern life maybe the
most important facet of historical archaeology. Although we study the minute and
particular, it is possible to have insights based on small-scale researches that allow
“insights into the larger issues of world history” (Orser and Fagan 1994:19).
The past studied by historical archaeologists is often still unfolding and, thus, is
relevant to the present, especially in the borderlands where cultures came into contact.
We have the ability to concentrate on named, known people from the historical record
and add a dimension to their lives based on the archaeological record. In this way we
document the daily lives of people known previously only in a general sense. By nature
our individual archaeological projects emphasize the small-scale, the minute and
particular. We can choose to excavate sites that represent ordinary people, not
members of the elite, but we have other obligations with respect to the artifact analysis.
79

It is our responsibility to give our small-scale projects a global dimension by combining
them with archival research, oral histories, and genealogies, thus creating a rich context
for the material culture we uncover. Through this multi-scalar approach we may facilitate
discussions of ethnicity.
Ethnicities Among Nuevo Santander Colonists
The existence of the casta system in colonial New Spain makes a consideration
of ethnicity essential to understanding the social context of the archaeological record.
Españoles included both those born in Spain (peninsulares) and in the New World of
European descent (criollos). The Indian category included only those people of full
indigenous descent. The castas were composed of mestizos (español and Indian) and
other people of mixed descent including afromestizos (Indian and Black or mestizo and
Black). Of course, the españoles benefited the most from Crown policies regarding
legal and economic privileges. Peninsulares fared better than criollos when one
considers their monopoly on international trade and high-level governmental positions.
Criollos were appointed to less prestigious positions and enjoyed other privileges
reserved for españoles, including the ability to own property, to ride a horse, and to
carry a weapon.
“The social and economic mobility of the rest of the population was seriously
limited by the legal statuses ascribed to their ancestral groups” (Menchaca 2001:63).
Indians benefited in some way by their access to communal lands, but as a group, they
were not accorded much social prestige. Mestizos may have enjoyed more social
prestige, but they were not accorded similar privileges reserved for either españoles or
Indians (Menchaca 2001:63-64). A frontier such as the Río Grande communities of
Nuevo Santander likely provided members of casta groups an opportunity to move
80

from a life as a wage laborer in a mining community to life as a property owner and
livestock raiser. They would have traded the relative security of a mining community for
a commitment to defend their property and hence the frontier against attack by Indian
groups.
Here I return to a myth of racial purity among Nuevo Santander colonists that I
first mentioned in the previous chapter. This myth is kept alive by local historians and
scholars alike. Here I quote two paragraphs from Raúl García Flores (1996:2) and offer
my translation:
“Una creencia sin fundamentos pero repetida hasta el cansancio
pretende que en las fronteras de la Hispanoamérica Colonial pobladas
por grupos cazador-recolectores o con una agricultura incipiente, la
población estuvo compuesta por españoles colonos, sin mezcla con la
población nativa. Ese “purismo racial” encuentra sus ecos, por ejemplo,
en Argentina o el norte de México. Traspolando la innegable
marginación y extinction de los indios en la segunda mitad del siglo
XIX, se nos presenta una imagen distorsionada de la sociedad colonial,
en la que la presencia native fue pilar indispensable no solo de la
población sino del concepto mismo de América que manejaba la
administración criolla y peninsular.
“En el Noreste de México los prejuicios han predominado sobre el
conocimiento científico. Se assume sin mayor argumento que la
‘auténtica’ y ‘original’ población de la zona se compuso por criollos y
uno que otro Tlaxcalteca, casi sin participación de los indios locales ni
mucho menos de negros o mulatos.”
Author’s translation:
“One belief without foundation but that has been repeated until it is
worn out, is the pretense that in the frontiers of colonial New Spain
where the indigenous populations were hunter-gatherers or practiced
incipient agriculture, the Spanish colonists did not mix with the native
peoples. This ‘purity of race’ myth has its echoes in Argentina and in
northern México. Considering the undeniable marginalization and
extinction of Indians during the second half of the nineteenth century, this

81

myth presents a distorted image of colonial society, in that the
indigenous presence was an indispensable pillar not only of the
population, but also of the self-concept of America that was maintained
by the criollos and peninsulares of the colonial administration.
“In northeastern México such prejudices have dominated scientific
belief. It is assumed without major argument that the ‘authentic’ or
‘original’ population of the region was composed of criollos and a few
Tlaxcalan Indians, but without the participation of the local indigenous
groups, much less that of Blacks or mulattos (García Flores 1996:2).”
García Flores (1996:3) could find only two scholars who dared challenge this
myth as it relates to northern México: a small study by Isidro Vizcaya (1969) that
evaluates the composition of castas in the population of Nuevo Leon at the end of the
colonial period; and Pedro Gómez Danés who studied the population at the Misión de
Hualahuises in Nuevo Leon (1990). Gómez Danés developed two themes in later
articles (1993) regarding the colonial population of Nuevo Leon. The first states that the
colonial population of Nuevo Leon was essentially mestizo with a high percentage of
indiomestizos and afromestizos. His second theme is that the native population,
collectively referred by him as chicimecas, was not exterminated, but rather actively
participated in the construction and mestizaje of northeastern México (Gómez Danés
1990 as cited in García Flores 1996:4).
My approach to studying the ethnicities of the Nuevo Santander colonists is
based on a working definition of ethnicity as put forth by Sian Jones (1997), which
considers ethnic groups to be “culturally ascribed identity groups, which are based on
the expression of a real or assumed shared culture and common descent (usually
through the objectification of cultural, linguistic, religious, historical and/or physical
characteristics)” (Jones 1997:84). Furthermore, I consider ethnicity to be a process

82

involving “a consciousness of difference, which to varying degrees, entails the
reproduction and transformation of basic classificatory distinctions between groups of
people who perceive themselves to be in some respect culturally distinct” (Eriksen
1992:3 as cited in Jones 1997:84).
My approach aims for a contextual analysis of a multidimensional ethnicity. I
regard the school of thought known as primordialism, which views ethnicity as
biologically determined and related to psychological kinship and blood relations, as too
narrow a definition to explain the social dynamics of the Nuevo Santander colonists.
Instead I find instrumentalism, with its emphasis on culture, to be a better vehicle for
understanding the subtleties and complexities of fluid ethnicities and social identities on
the frontier. Instrumentalism defines ethnic origin according to its cultural manifestations
and considers ethnicity to be malleable depending on necessity or circumstance (Fesler
and Franklin 1999). This approach allows for consideration of how ethnicities are
constructed, how identities are manipulated by those who wear them, and how and why
such identities function as they do for the bearer in varying social contexts. At its core,
my approach assumes that ethnic identification and affiliation serve as dynamic
negotiating social forces.
My research questions concerning ethnicity include an analysis of the
mechanisms by which settlers relinquished some identities and assumed new ones. Was
the process instantaneous, with the granting of certain privileges, or does the identity
shift take one or several generations to evolve as aspects of language and material
culture develop? How reliable is the ethnohistorical record for determining the ethnic
identities of Nuevo Santander colonists?

83

Mapping Material Culture and Archival Documents Theoretically
The material record for South Texas and northeastern México, besides this
dissertation project, consists primarily of the collection at TARL from excavations by the
Smithsonian Institute in 1951, which was only recently analyzed (Hartle and Stephenson
1951, Bonine 2001). It is to these artifacts that the following discussion will refer,
although the author is aware that more recently collected and analyzed materials exist
(Pertulla 1999). Mindy Bonine (2001) approached the data looking for cultural
processes at the household level and considered all six one-room, stone structures to be
part of the same rancho settlement. Unfortunately for the direct historical approach, the
land grantee’s family does not appear in subsequent records from Mier, however,
comparative data from other sources can help one infer the nature of life on the rancho
of Porción 55 (1817 Mier Census as reproduced in Galindo 1999:90-107). Although
there are limits to the amount of information artifacts from excavations fifty years ago
can contribute, what is important for the present discussion are the general classes of
artifacts available to the archaeologist and methods of analysis that realize the promise
of the above definition of the practice.
Alternatively, extensive archival sources are available regarding the colony of
Nuevo Santander in general and Mier in particular (i.e., church marriage, baptism, and
death records, and city, state, and national archives). It has been possible for scholars to
examine the marriage, inheritance, and settlement patterns of the pobladores (Galindo
1999), as well as to document the presence of Indians and Blacks in the founding of
Mier (Herrera Casasús 1998).
Archaeology along the lower Río Grande has another obligation to fulfill: To
amply and extend South Texas history, taking fuller account of the significant relationship
84

between South Texas and Nuevo Santander. Despite the 24 porciones of Mier on the
north bank of the Río Grande that were officially recognized by Texas as the legal
property of the descendents of Spanish settlers, Nuevo Santander gets left out of Texas
history. Land was granted to colonists on both banks of the Lower Río Grande—from
Laredo to Brownsville—and these pobladores practiced some of the earliest livestock
raising in what is now Texas. Therefore, historical archaeology is uniquely poised to
revise and supplement South Texas history, specifically in Starr County, which includes
about one-third of the total land granted by the Spanish Crown to the inhabitants of
Mier.
How does all this relate to the theory behind Orser and Fagan’s definition? Let’s
look at specifics. The connections between the first part (being multidisciplinary while
rooted in anthropology and history) and the practice of historical archaeology in South
Texas to date seem evident in recent works (Bonine 2001, Galindo 1999, Herrera
Casasús 1998), even though its roots began as rescue archaeology in the 1950s.
Two challenges to the historical archaeologist in this respect are: 1. The archives
are not available translated, except in rare cases, therefore, the Spanish language is
requisite, as is familiarity with Spanish colonial terms and abbreviations; and 2.
Information in the archives is often difficult to locate or access, except on rare occasions
that sources such as the Benson Latin American Collection or the Texas General Land
Office contains compilations, translations, or copies.
One avenue open to future scholars in this region is to create a multidisciplinary
forum or network for researcher to facilitate communication among the varying
approaches. It could be as simple as an annual conference or thematic presentations at

85

one of the existing conferences, but it would serve to encourage interest in the region
and to build a network of scholars in varying disciplines and make possible the requisite
multidisciplined approach. Concentrating interest by the establishment of annual field
schools to excavate rancho sites in South Texas would also provide graduate students
with the opportunity of sustained research.
The second part of Orser and Fagan’s definition (1994) deals with the concept
of a post-prehistoric past, a term that signifies that the world was a different place after
Europeans took Western culture to various places on the globe, but without privileging
literacy or giving it a primary role in shaping recent history. I interpret this to mean the
intersection, or more properly, the collision between history (or popular myth) and
anthropology. This is the juncture where archaeology can facilitate the amplification of
history. Orser and Fagan’s definition has several applications for South Texas
archaeology in this regard.
Ethnic Composition of Pobladores
I presented a section in the last chapter that reviewed the first census for Mier in
1753 and extrapolated the casta designations from it and from the Camargo census of
1749. That the majority of the colonists were designated “espanol” is not surprising
given oral history, but the interesting result of the exercise were three people who did
not have “Don” or “Doña” titles before their names. Ana Salinas was designated a
mestiza, while her husband José Bazán Pardo had neither a title nor an apparent casta
designation. The same was true for their son, Joaquín Bazán Pardo. As I searched for
more information about the Bazán Pardo family, I could not find the last name “Pardo”
in any volume of baptimal, marriage, or death records from Camargo, Cerralvo, or
Mier. What I deduced what that their last name was actually Bazán while “Pardo” was
86

their casta designation meaning the child of a Black and an español (Barnes et al.
1981:92). Significantly, the casta designation disappears for both men in the official
document which grants them porciones in 1767. Similarly in all the baptismal, marriage
and death records I located for the two (as compiled by SAGA), their last names are
simply Bazán with no casta information. Unfortunately, I was not able to locate an
official records that designated either of them as “español.” Instead what I found was
that the ethnicity of one of José and Ana’s grandsons is noted on his marriage record in
1809 as “mulato,” thus reaffirming the likelihood that “Pardo” was a casta designation
and not José’s mother’s maiden name.
The Bazán family record also reveals that the process of “whitening” or
changing castas was not instantaeous, that landownership was a factor, but not the
factor, and that “progress” during one generation may suffer a setback in the next. The
above example also emphasizes how very little is known about the Indian and Black
population that contributed to the settlement at Mier beyond baptismal records and
casta designations in census data (Herrera Casasús 1998). These documents often yield
conflicting or incomplete information. For example, in the 1753 census for Mier there
are at least 36 servants and their family members (or about 26% of the total population)
whose names and casta designations remain a mystery.
Most servants are listed with the families who own significant amounts of
livestock and who would logically need help tending to all those animals, but the two
factors do not always correlate, as Table 7 illustrates. The number of children in each
family does not appear to be a factor in the employment of servants. It would appear
that six of the nineteen families in the Mier census of 1753 have servants. However, the
livestock of five of the nineteen families were counted along with their parents, and these
87

families are indented beneath their parents in the table. Thus, when looking for a
correlation between amount of livestock and the need for servants it is useful to note
that six of the fourteen livestock-owning groups, or about 43% employ servants. Two
extended families, the Peñas and the Hinojosas, each own about 4,000 animals and
each employ nine servants. Nicolás González and Ana Josefa García, however, own
more than 2,000 animals but do not have any servants. Another couple with about the
same amount of livestock, Juan de Chapa and María Rita López de Jaen, employ 13
servants, the most of any other family.

Oral tradition holds that the pobladores were mostly of Spanish ancestry, were
well-educated, and spoke a proper form of Spanish (Gonzalez 1998). But as Table 7
illustrates a significant percentage of the founding colonists (about 26%) were servants

88

of unknown casta designation. Most likely, they were not españoles. Another early
census known for Mier (provided in the following Table 8) supports the myth that the
pobladores were mostly españoles, but again there is about 28% of the population that
is Indian or mestizo.

Although these data from 1779 reinforce the information about casta
designations gleaned from the 1753 census, the data in Table 8 also raise some
interesting questions when considered contextually. Specifically, Table 6 on page 69 lists
casta designations as registered in the 1788 Census for Mier, just nine years later. The
figures do not lend themselves to easy comparison because some of the casta categories
are lumped together, but apparently, within nine years Black and afromestizo categories
grow from zero to 42% of this population. It is also significant that total population
actually decreased by 15, thus, they must be replacing the earlier population. In other
words, españoles, Indian, and indomestizos went from being 100% of the population to
constituting only 58% of it in nine years.
Herrera Casasús’ (1998:60) research that was summarized in Table 5 on page
68 demonstrates that between 1767 and 1789 there were 113 births designated
afromestizo or about 29% of all births during this period. Clearly, this segment of Mier’s

89

population that was not apparently represented in earlier years of the colony
experiences a growth spurt during this time. The reasons for this remain unclear.
The historical record is silent at this point until the next available census with
casta information in 1853. By then Mier’s population is recorded as 5,082 with no
Blacks or afromestizos. The questions remain: Where did the Black and afromestizo
population come from, settle, and either go, or else, how were they integrated into the
society? How are these changes in population reflected in the material record? These
are all valid avenues of inquiry for historical archaeologists and involve issues that must
be approached from more directions than just the archives.
I attempted in the previous chapter to answer, despite a lack of relevant data,
how the afromestizo population was integrated into Mier based on general trends in
México at about the same time. Basically, most scholars agree that afromestizos did not
disappear, but rather through intermarriage and changes in dress and appearance their
descendents became classified as mestizo or español.
Settlement Patterns of Pobladores
Historical sources and oral history also offer conflicting information about the
exact nature of settlement in Nuevo Santander. Where did the population concentrate?
Within the boundaries of the town central, or on rancho settlements? Requirements for
land tenure included the provisions that settlers must reside on the land, protect it from
Indian attack, and construct homes (preferably of stone). Individual porciones were not
assigned in Mier or elsewhere in the colony until 1767, some fourteen years after the
initial colonists arrived; however, we know from the historical record that nineteen
families already lived on one or more ranchos in the vicinity of Mier in 1749 and
probably as early as 1734. These people would already have established ranchos by
90

the time that settlement at Mier was made official in 1753. Furthermore, settlers who
arrived in 1753 with livestock would have required sufficient pastures.
Class or wealth also plays a role in the rural vs. urban settlement pattern of
Spanish colonial society. The more affluent families were able to hire workers to run the
rancho, while the family resided in town with the advantages of increased security and
more social activities like school and church (Gonzalez 1998). Archaeology is uniquely
positioned to answer these questions about the nature of early colonial settlement.
Excavations at a wide-range of ranchos, a comprehensive rural regional settlement
survey, an assessment of the construction dates of extent historical structures in central
Mier, and further research of archival material, are all viable approaches to these
research questions.
This brings us to the final part of Orser and Fagan’s definition, which seeks to
understand the global nature of modern life. This means that insights based on smallscale research may allow insights into the larger issues of world history. The recent past,
as studied by historical archaeologists, is still unfolding and thus is relevant to the
present, especially in the borderlands where cultures come into contact. The Río
Grande has served to unite populations for centuries, if not millennia, before European
settlement. In reality, this geographical feature has been a divider for only 150 years of
its existence (from the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo until NAFTA). In this way
archaeology in South Texas and northeastern México can contribute to a better
understanding of contemporary border culture by studying the interconnections of past
settlements, trade networks, and cultural exchange. Such discussion would naturally
include considerations of class and ethnicity, factors that have influenced past
development and certainly continue to affect current society.

Chapter 5
Household Archaeology and the Nuevo Santander Ranching Community
Introduction
Given that a significant aspect of historical archaeology in South Texas
and northeastern Mexico focuses on civilian ranching settlements, it follows that
the sub-discipline should embrace the recent theoretical debate regarding
household archaeology (Netting and Wilk 1984, Ashmore and Wilk 1988, Hendon
1996, Yanagisako 1979). As stated in the previous chapter, a defining trend in
historical archaeology is toward a multi-disciplinary approach, rooted in
anthropology and history, that focuses on illuminating the daily lives of ordinary
people—subjects traditionally ignored in academia (Orser and Fagan 1994).
This chapter summarizes the various archaeological concepts of
households and household production with the goal of better understanding the
morphology and functions of Spanish colonial rancho settlements. To this end,
genealogical and archival data are combined to reconstruct the individuals and
their livestock that populated these ranchos. This is also an exercise in developing
research methods and designs, including both archival and excavation strategies. I
first summarize the archaeological conceptions of households and then present
three brief reconstructions of ranchos as recorded in census data for Mier,
Tamaulipas, Mexico. After comparing the two characterizations, I offer a
definition for rancho households based on the two sets of data, while considering
the implications of this definition for this and future archaeological excavations.
Archaeological Conceptions of Households
Archaeology at the household level is not unique to historical archaeology,
but it is in this area that distinct households are identifiable both on the ground

92

and through documentary evidence. The concept is relatively new, with the main
theoretical foundations laid out fewer than 20 years ago. There is a strong bias
from a functional, structural, and cultural perspective that shapes the definition of
household. This perspective is counterbalanced by a regard for the activities of its
members (Netting and Wilk 1984, Ashmore and Wilk 1988) and the
corresponding symbolic dimensions of households (Hendon 1996, Yanagisako
1979).
The following is a summation of the various theoretical sources that have
influenced my approach to an ethnohistorical account of the Spanish colonial
settlement of Mier. It is guided in general by Mary C. Beaudry’s call for a
contextual and interpretive approach to household analysis, with attention to the
variation of households (1989:84-85). She calls for detailed, interpretive studies
of individual home sites that account for site formation processes and that focus
on the contextual relationships among artifacts and soil strata. In other words, she
advocates conducting highly detailed, multi-disciplinary case studies of individual
sites and their histories (1989:85). Specifically, she calls for the “combination of
different forms of contextual analysis—cultural and historical context derived
from documentary evidence and environmental context derived from ecological
data” (1989:89). Together these analyses provide historical archaeologists with a
“powerful interpretive device that allows for greater…understanding (of) how
cultural behavior at the level of the household has influenced the formation of the
archaeological record (1989:89).
The theoretical framework upon which I base my working definition of
“household” incorporates primarily the ideas of Robert Netting and Richard Wilk
93

(1984), who established the distinction between the morphological ways of
describing households in terms of kinship and residence patterns, from the
structural and behavioral aspects of the household. They sought to change the
questions that archaeologists ask about households from those grounded in
structure to those grounded in activity. They advocate “relating both the
morphology and the functions of the household groups to each other and to wider
social, economic, and cultural realms” (1984:4).
Defining Households
Netting and Wilk (1984:7) defined five categories of household activity:
production, distribution, transmission, reproduction, and coresidence. The
intensity of production is seen to affect the size of households. Simultaneous labor
requirements of major productive tasks and the existence of diverse tasks within a
yearly cycle contribute to a tendency for larger household groups (Netting and
Wilk 1984:7).
Distribution involves transactions between households. Larger groups may
pool their resources to compensate for sources of income that are diverse,
seasonal, variable, or unpredictable (Netting and Wilk 1984:9). Transmission
refers to the intergenerational transmission of property within households. “In
general, socioeconomic stratification appears to be directly reflected in average
household size….wealth and prestige attract and hold the members of larger
households while the poor can usually sustain only smaller groups of coresidents” (Netting 1982 as cited in Netting and Wilk 1984:13). Coresidence,
according to Wilk and Netting’s (1984:17) definition, refers to household

94

members sharing living space, the physical confines and availability of which
condition the size and composition of households.
Wendy Ashmore and Robert Wilk (1988:4) added consumption to the list
of household functions and refined the terms used to describe aspects of
households such as coresidence groups, and dwelling. A coresidence group is a
group of people who regularly share living quarters without necessarily sharing
household activities (what Laslett (1972) defined as housefull). A dwelling is the
physical structure within which residential activities took place. Households can
be dispersed among a number of dwellings (Horne 1982 as cited in Ashmore and
Wilk 1988:6).
Ashmore and Wilk considered household archaeology as an extension of
settlement archaeology (1988:7). Settlement patterns are seen to consist of a
hierarchical set of patterns at different scales usually involving three tiers: single
structures, site layouts, and intersite distribution (Ashmore and Wilk 1988:7).
S.J. Yanagisako (1979:166) explored the contested meaning of domestic,
which she presented as having at its core two sets of functional activities: those
pertaining to food production and consumption and those pertaining to social
reproduction, including child-bearing and child-rearing. She proposed that there
are three types of variables that underlie variations in domestic organization. She
postulated that as domestic groups move through their developmental cycles, one
can expect not only changes in the demographic structure, but also an impact on
the economy of the household as its size and the composition of the eligible
producers within the domestic group change (1979:167). Her third variable is
stratification, which is evident in fluctuations in size and wealth, social mobility,
95

and the kin ties that bind together households in different strata (Yanagisako
1979:175).
Yanagisako advocated the study of kinship as a symbolic system in which
“meanings attributed to the relationships and actions of kinsmen are drawn from a
range of cultural domains, including religion, nationality, ethnicity, gender, and
folk concepts of the ‘person’” (1979:193). This symbolic system approach helps
to make sense of the range of diversity present in family and kinship
organizations within one society (1979:193). It also aids in the study of inequality
within domestic organization, specifically with respect to the political and
economic processes of societies (1979:196).
Julia A. Hendon (1996:46) expanded on the symbolic dimension of
households by applying Pierre Bourdieu’s (1977) sense of practice to the term.
She arrived at her definition of household by considering what people do as
members of a domestic group and the meanings assigned to their actions. She
used household and domestic group interchangeably to refer to the task-oriented,
coresident, and symbolically meaningful social group that forms “the next bigger
thing on the social map after the individual” (1996:47). Hendon emphasized the
conflict inherent in a domestic group that consists of social actors differentiated
by age, gender, role, and power whose agendas and interests do not always
coincide (1996:46). “The household is, in effect, politicized in that its internal
relations are inextricable from the larger economic and political structure of
society” (1996:46). She also addressed the implications of craft specialization at
the household level, by pointing out that “incorporating specialized production
into the household’s definition of its appropriate and necessary tasks must result
96

in reallocations of time and responsibility for specialists and other household
members alike” (1996:52). “It may also change the balance of power among
household members and how certain tasks are valued” (1996:52).
Archaeological Applications of Household Theory
The framework of household theory can facilitate our understanding of the
organization and production systems of rancho households, thereby illuminating
the motivations and survival strategies employed by eighteenth-century colonists.
Knowledge of this sort can be used to guide future archaeological excavations.
For example, census data reveal that multiple households resided on each rancho
(Galindo 1999), so survey and excavations must consider the number and
arrangement of structures across the landscape that constitute a single rancho. The
number and types of animals each family possessed (also accessible through
census data) can help plan the appropriate scope of archaeological investigations,
specifically, how activity areas were located and in what combinations they were
likely to be found. Ethnographic data reveal that socioeconomic factors
influenced residence patterns, such that one household may have maintained both
a dwelling in town and one on the rancho.
A Sampling of Ancient Ranchos as Recorded on the Census of 1817
Methodology
The following reconstructions are based on information contained in a
portion of a census from approximately 1817. I cross-referenced these data with
information from the baptism, marriage, and death records of Mier, Tamaulipas,
Mexico, as published by the Spanish American Genealogical Society. The
approximate date of the census was determined after comparing the baptism
97

records of 15 residents of El Rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas with their ages as
recorded on the census. This partial census comes from an individual’s private
collection and was analyzed with permission. It is reprinted in its entirety in the
author’s master’s report (Galindo 1999:90-107).
The census documents the residents and livestock on eight ranchos: Santo
Tomas de Sabinitas, Santa Teresa de Guardado, San Gregorio del Saleno, San
Pedro de las Flores, Santa Barbara de Morteritos, San José de la Rinconada, Jesus
de Buenavista, and San Lorenzo de las Minas. A total of 411 residents in 76
families lived on these 8 ranchos. An average of 9.5 families lived on each
rancho, with the average family containing about 6 members.
Descriptions of Three Nuevo Santander Ranchos
In the following description of three of the eight ranchos recorded in the
1817 census, an effort was made to trace the genealogy of the residents of the
ranchos to expose settlement patterns. The descriptions include information about
the top livestock owners for each rancho. The three ranchos are presented
according to the number of livestock the residents owned, beginning with the one
with the fewest animals, El Rancho San Pedro de las Flores.
For this rancho, I was able to trace each family back to two Sáenz
families. The same is true for El Rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas, where 10 of
11 families are a part of the Ramón Guerra and Rosalia Hinojosa family. At El
Rancho Santo Tomas de Sabinitas, however, a lack of archival information made
it impossible to determine if or how 6 of the 17 families are related to the Manuel
Angel Hinojosa and Juana Sánchez family. All six families are Hinojosas, which
makes it likely that they are blood relatives.
98

El Rancho San Pedro de las Flores
According to the 1817 census, this rancho had 45 residents in 9 families,
who owned 54 animals. All nine of these families have been traced through the
marriage, baptism, and death records of Mier to the two poblador families of Juan
Francisco Sáenz and Teresa Peña, and Miguel Sáenz and Gertrudis Hinojosa
(Figures 11 and 12). The exact relationship between Juan Francisco and Miguel
Sáenz could not be determined from the Mier records. Juan Francisco received
Mier Porción 7 and Miguel was awarded Porción 73 in 1767 (Figure 2 on page
10). Rancho residents include the children and grandchildren of these pobladores.
In terms of livestock, San Pedro de las Flores ranked seventh among the
eight ranchos in the partial census (Table 9). The largest livestock owner was Juan
Francisco and Teresa Peña’s son, Francisco Sáenz, who owned 27 cows, horses,
and mules. The next largest owner is the husband of Miguel’s greatgranddaughter, Emenegildo Guerra, who had 16 cows, horses, and mules.
The average family size was five, with a range from three to nine. More
than one-half of the residents are under age twenty. Another third are between the
ages of twenty and thirty-nine.
El Rancho Santo Tomas de Sabinitas
According to the 1817 census, this rancho had 80 residents in 17 families,
who owned 319 animals. Eleven of these families have been traced through the
marriage, baptism, and death records of Mier to the Manuel Angel Hinojosa and
Juana Sánchez family (Figure 13). Manuel Angel received Mier Porción 5 while
his father was awarded Porción 4 in 1767 (Figure 2 on page 10). The extended

families of two of their daughters and two of their sons resided together on this
rancho.
In terms of livestock, Santo Tomas de Sabinitas ranked fourth among the
eight ranchos in the partial census (Table 9). The eldest son of Manuel and Juana,
Santiago Hinojosa, was the largest livestock owner with 256 animals, including
200 sheep and 50 goats. No one else on the rancho owned sheep or goats.
Santiago’s younger brother, Marcelino Hinojosa, owned 17 cows, horses, and
mules. Of the two daughters of Manuel and Juana who lived on the rancho,
Anastacia’s husband also owned 17 cows, horses, and mules and Gertrudis’
husband owned 5 cows and horses.
The average family size was 4.7 people, with a range from two to nine.
One-half of the residents were under age twenty. Twenty five percent were
between the ages of twenty and twenty-nine.
El Rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas
According to the 1817 census, this rancho had 63 residents in 11 families,
who owned 1,824 animals. Ten of these families have been traced through the
marriage, baptism, and death records of Mier to the Ramón Guerra and Rosalia
Hinojosa family (Figure 14). The eleventh family was more distantly related
through Rosalia’s uncle Gervacio Hinojosa. Ramón was awarded Mier Porción 6
in 1767 (Figure 2 on page 10). Rosalia’s father Manuel Hinojosa received Mier
Porción 4, while her brother Manuel Angel Hinojosa received Porción 5.
Three sons and three daughters of Ramón and Rosalia, along with their
families, resided on the rancho. After the death of their son Vicente Guerra, their
daughter-in-law, María Josefa Ramírez, continued to reside on the rancho, even
104

after she remarried. Her second husband, Ramón Barrera, was the largest
livestock owner, with 1,144 animals, including 800 sheep and 300 goats. In terms
of livestock, San Lorenzo de las Minas ranked second among the eight ranchos in
the census (Table 9). Alejandro Guerra, the eldest son of Ramón and Rosalia, was
the second-largest livestock owner, with 451 animals, including 400 sheep and 36
goats.
The average family size was 5.7, with a range from two to ten. More than
one-half of the residents were under age twenty. Another 25% are between ages
twenty and thirty-nine.
Summary and Analysis of Census Data
The census data for Mier ranchos (Galindo 1999) reveal a settlement
pattern of multiple, closely related households residing together on one rancho.
Except for two widows, livestock was exclusively male-owned. It was
concentrated in the hands of a few male members, although not always the eldest
males of the lineage. Male in-laws often had significant livestock holdings.
The distribution of livestock among males within a rancho sheds light on
inheritance patterns and marriage strategies. Distinct animal husbandry strategies
are also evident in the census, with some ranchers choosing to raise more sheep
and goats than cattle or horses. Others raise cows and horses to the exclusion of
sheep and goats. These strategies reveal a specialization of production at the
household level that implies mutual cooperation among rancho residents. There
was probably a high degree of self-sufficiency in terms of crop and livestock
production on the ranchos. Coupled with cooperative practices among neighbors,
it no doubt worked to ensure the survival of all rancho residents and neighbors.
106

The distribution patterns of livestock ownership may hold clues to the
distribution of people on the ranchos. For example, households with larger herds
might live farther apart from each other than those with smaller herds because of
pasture requirements. It is also possible, given the likelihood of attack on the
frontier, that households were located in relatively close proximity for mutual
protection. The necessity to live close together may have prompted the settlers to
rely on alternative herding methods. The management of the herds may have been
accomplished by mobile teams of horse-mounted vaqueros working at great
distances from their primary dwellings. Thus emerges a settlement pattern of
multiple, extended families residing together on one rancho and constituting, at a
certain scale, a household in terms of production, distribution, transmission,
reproduction, co-residence, and consumption.
Definition of Rancho Household
Informed by the noted theoretical approaches and based on the census
data, I define the Spanish colonial rancho household as comprised of members of
an extended kin network residing in multiple structures arranged strategically
along the landscape. Their land would have belonged jointly to the kin network or
lineage, while each unit of the network would have exerted control over their
respective livestock and pastures. The overall economic strategy would have
favored the rancho as a whole over individual kin units. Thus, Spanish colonial
ranchos were characterized by a high degree of mutual cooperation and
organization based primarily on kin relationships, although there was room for
fictive kin and laborers on the ranchos.

107

This is a working definition and no doubt will be modified as future
excavations and research proceed. It may prove cumbersome to define a rancho as
comprised of 10-15 households, as well as difficult to locate archaeologically.
This definition will have to evolve to account for the instances when one family
or lineage maintained two separate residences, one each in town and on the
rancho. Further documentary research may reveal more about the economic
workings of the ranchos, specifically, whether they were economically unified or
if individuals transacted independently of other rancho members. The
complementary distribution of livestock, with different kin units specializing in
certain animals, suggests that economic activity was more on the level of ranchos
rather than on the individual kin unit level.
Conclusion
The morphology and functions of Spanish colonial rancho settlements are
made evident when the analysis is focused at the household level. This type of
analysis also helps to concentrate on the daily lives and activities of ordinary
people. Individuals and their relationships to the household are considered
through a multi-scalar approach that combines genealogical and archival data to
reconstruct the individuals and their livestock that populated these ranchos. Such
information is crucial to developing excavation strategies and interpreting the
material culture of the ranchos. The next chapter is the application of this theory
and methodology to the origins of Rancho El Saladito.

108

Chapter 6: The Ethnohistory and the Origins of Rancho El Saladito
Introduction
This chapter documents the ethnohistory and origins of Rancho El
Saladito, the site of an archaeological research project focusing on a Spanish
colonial civilian ranching settlement, which dates from the mid-eighteenth century,
and is associated with the community of Mier, Tamaulipas, Mexico (Figure 15).
The archaeological project forms a crucial part of this multi-scalar study, which
incorporates ethnographic, genealogical, and archival research. The archaeological
project was accomplished during three roughly month-long phases that consisted
of mapping, excavating, and analyzing the recovered artifacts. Together with prior
research (Bonine 2001, Fleming and Perttula 1999, Galindo 1999, George 1975,
Hartle and Stephenson 1951, Krieger and Hughes 1950, Perttula et. al 1999) this
fieldwork helps document some of the earliest ranches associated with Texas.
The settlement at Rancho El Saladito is divided into two temporally and
spatially distinct occupations. The ranch is bisected by the Arroyo El Saladito
which delivers both run-off and sulfurous spring water to the Río Grande. Based
on artifact analysis and census data, settlement on the east side of the arroyo began
shortly after Mier was founded as part of the colony of Nuevo Santander in 1753
and continued until after 1824 when Matamoros became an international port and
a conduit of English ceramics.
Oral history tells us that a settlement of one or more jacales existed in 1928
on the east side of the arroyo (Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra,
personal communication 2002). Operation 1, Suboperations A and B were placed
near this location. After the property changed hands, construction started on the
109

Figure 15: Rancho El Saladito is located east of Mier, Tamaulipas, Mexico, along Highway 2.

west side of the arroyo where settlement continues to the present, and includes a
one-room stone structure, the ruins of a dam, the ruins of a lime kiln, a building
stone quarry, and a sulfurous spring. Although oral history puts the beginning of
the most recent occupation at 1928 on the west side of the arroyo, certain glass
and metal artifacts (magnesium (purple) bottle glass and square nails) suggest an
occupation on the west side dating to at least the late 1800s.
Fortunately, several sets of census data survive for Mier, including 1782,
1790, 1800, and a partial census from approximately 1817. Using a combination of
genealogical information, land grant records, and census data, it is possible to trace
the descendents of the pobladores who founded El Rancho San Lorenzo de las

110

Minas, which may have been the precursor to Rancho El Saladito. The next two
sections address both the origins of the ranch, of the colonists, and their
descendents who inhabited it.
General Historical Background of Project Area
The Origins of Rancho El Saladito
According to oral history, Rancho El Saladito is located within the original
boundaries of Mier Porción 6, which was awarded to José Ramón Guerra in 1767
(Gil Javier Guerra Sandoval, personal communication 1998; Herrera Perez 1986).
Genealogical research conducted by family members also connects them to the
José Ramón Guerra and María Rosalia Hinojosa family (Gil Javier Guerra
Sandoval, personal communication 1998). Rancho El Saladito was purchased in
1928 by Adolfo Hinojosa Sáenz and San Juana Gómez Gómez (Doña María Berta
Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra, personal communication 2002).
One of their daughters, Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra, was
about six years old when they bought the ranch. She remembers one or two jacales
in the vicinity of Operation 1, Suboperations A and B (personal communication
2002). Her family never occupied the jacales, but rather her father hired Francisco
Hinojosa Barrera to build a stone house on the opposite side of the Arroyo El
Saladito (Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra, personal communication
2002). Francisco, like many of the other ranch laborers, lived in the nearby
community of Los Guerra. The house he built still stands today and is maintained
by the family (Figures 16 and 17).
Adolfo Hinojosa Sáenz and San Juana Gómez Gómez lived on the ranch
and coordinated the work of a few laborers. In times of harvest or slaughter, they
111

Saladito.

112

employed up to 10 people. Most of the laborers came from Los Guerra and went
home at night. Occasionally they would stay overnight at the ranch inside a jacal
associated with the cooking horno excavated at Operation 2, Suboperation A
(Figure 18). There was also another jacal structure to the immediate north of the
stone building, where a covered cement porch is now located (Doña María Berta
Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra, personal communication 2002).
Adolfo and San Juana’s children did not live at the ranch, but they joined
their parents there on the weekends. The children lived in Mier with their
grandmother so they could attend school. They traveled by wagon to the ranch.

Figure 18: Operation 2, Suboperation A. The remains of a cooking horno located southeast of
the stone structure.
113

Their parents grew crops on a terrace between the stone house and the arroyo.
There was another garden close to the house with a variety of vegetables. They
also raised a wide variety of animals. (Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de
Guerra, personal communication 2002).
Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra supplied the names of her
parents and grandparents. She also knew her husband’s parents and his maternal
grandparents. Using the baptismal, marriage, and death records for Mier (SAGA
publications 1989) and census data (Overstreet 1990), I reconstructed the
following family tree (Figure 19). Unfortunately, I found no further information
about Hildegardo Guerra’s ancestors. A wealth of information exists, however,
about the Hinojosa and Gómez families. For example, it turns out that the founders
of Rancho El Saladito, Adolfo Hinojosa and San Juana Gómez, were both distantly
related to the Manuel Angel Hinojosa and María Juana Sanchez family. Four
generations back on San Juana Gómez’ family tree is María Ines Hinojosa, the
daughter of Manuel Angel Hinojosa and María Juana Sanchez. This family
received Mier Porción 5 in 1767 (Figure 2 on page 10). Another of their sons, Jose
Vicente Hinojosa, is three generations back on Adolfo Hinojosa’s family tree.
Manuel Angel Hinojosa’s sister, María Rosalia Hinojosa married Ramon
Guerra, who received Mier Porción 6 in 1767 (Figure 2 on page 10). My research
did not establish a connection between Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de
Guerra’s family and the Ramon Guerra family; however, research undertaken
previously by family members has made this connection (Gil Javier Guerra
Sandoval, personal communication 1998). If I could find more information about

Gil Javier Guerra (my informant’s great-grandfather), I would likely be able to
connect these families through time.
Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra’s family tree includes five
recipients of Mier Porciones and one from Camargo. In Mier, porciones 2, 5, 8,
20, 21, and 67 were awarded to José Santiago Barrera, José Manuel Angel
Hinojosa, José Gervacio Hinojosa, Nicolas Gonzalez (porciones 20 and 21), and
José Antonio Ramirez, respectively (Figure 2 on page 10). According to census
data, there are also several ranchos that are associated with her family tree,
including Rancho La Bonita y San Nicolas, Rancho Los Arrieros, and Rancho San
Francisco. I focus now on the family of José Ramón Guerra and María Rosalia
Hinojosa, who established a El Rancho San Lorenzo on their porción.
Based on the baptismal, marriage, and death records for Mier (SAGA
publications 1989), I have reconstructed the family tree for José Ramón Guerra
and María Rosalia Hinojosa (Figure 20). She was the daughter of Manuel Hinojosa
and Ines de Chapa, who received Mier Porción 4. Rosalia’s brother Manuel Angel
Hinojosa, as I previously noted, received Mier Porción 5 and her uncle Gervacio
Hinojosa received Mier Porción 8 (Figure 2 on page 10). This does not exhaust the
list of her relatives who received land grants in Mier’s jurisdiction, but it helps
illuminate the settlement pattern of the immediate area. For example, Mier Porción
7 was awarded to José Juan Francisco Saenz and María Teresa Pena (Figure 2 on
page 10). Two of the Saenz daughters married two of María Rosalia Hinojosa’s
nephews within six days of each other in January 1786 (SAGA publications 1989).
Thus emerges the image of a sparsely populated frontier whose settlers are
strengthened by their extended family ties. Marriage bonds united families,

property, and landgrants. Among the pobladores of Nuevo Santander, Rosalia’s
nephews did not stand out because they married sisters. The low population
density contributed to the frequent practice of multiple siblings marrying into the
same other family, as did the motivation to consolidate land holdings and/or
maximize access to key natural resources (Galindo 1999).
Ancient v. Modern Ranch Locations
The map of Mier’s porciones is based on several sources, but primarily it is
derived from an unprovenienced and undated copy of a map on file with the Texas
General Land Office. I projected boundary lines that had faded on the original map
and extended the numbering where I could with confidence. I was able to assign
neither porción 9 nor 30 through 32 to a place on the map. Additionally, there are
large areas of the map without numbers. I also used information from a 1958 map
of Mier that illustrates porciones 33 through 54. Information about the 24
porciones located north of the Río Grande (55 through 78) comes from Starr
County Texas maps dating from 1930 and 1974 (Galindo 1999).
For this part of the analysis, I decided to superimpose the porción map
onto a modern map of the area to determine with what accuracy I could match up
ancient porciones with their modern locations (Figure 21). Specifically, I wanted to
see if the modern location of Rancho El Saladito matched up with Mier Porción 6.
I used several landmarks and features to match up the two maps. First I used the
Río Grande as a guide, while matching up the location of Roma on the two maps. I
also used the Río Alamo and its tributaries as guides. In the end I had to accept an
imperfect match, which is inconclusive, but instructional.

118

Figure 21: Map of the Mier porciones overlaid on a modern map of the area.

119

Specifically, the positioning of Mier and the Isla Hinojosa on the porción
map does not match up well with their modern equivalents when simultaneously
there is the best fit according to the Río Grande, the Río Alamo, and the town of
Roma. The placement of Mier is not as critical because there is a good fit along the
Río Alamo in that area; however, the placement of the Isla Hinojosa is very critical,
given the location of Porción 6 in relation to this island.
The overlay is inconclusive. It is not clear whether Rancho El Saladito is a
part of Porción 6 or 7 when evidence from only the overly is considered. However,
according to the relative location of the Isla Hinojosa with Porción 6 as portrayed
in the porciones map, and based on the strength of oral history, it is more likely
that the ranch is indeed associated with Porción 6 and the Ramón Guerra family.
Origins of the Guerra and Hinojosa Families
Manuel Hinojosa and Ines de Chapa brought their family to Mier from
Cerralvo, Nuevo Leon. This family was one of 19 associated with the ranching
settlement of José Felix de Almondoz that was formed in 1734 by 166 people
(Casteñeda 1976; Herrera Perez 1986; Graham 1994). The ranch was called El
Paso del Cántaro, located near and named for an easy ford of the Río Alamo. This
passage led to at least two nearby and reliable fords of the Río Bravo (Río
Grande): El Paso de los Arrieros (muleteers), located between Mier Porciones 53
and 63; and El Alamo, located between Mier Porción 66 and the town plat
(González 1998; Figure 2 on page 10). This branch of the Hinojosa family appears
in the historical record in 1749 associated with the colonial settlement of Camargo.
They, along with the other 18 families of El Paso del Cántaro, were forced to
enroll as settlers of Camargo to prevent being driven off their land (Casteñeda
120

1976). These same families formed the core of the population of Mier in 1753,
when the town was renamed and organized as part of Nuevo Santander. Ramón
Guerra’s name appears on the list in 1749, associated with Manuel Angel
Hinojosa’s family, but he was not an approved colonist, perhaps because he was
not yet married (Guerra 1989). He and María Rosalia Hinojosa had to petition the
church in Cerralvo for permission to marry because they apparently were closely
related (Gil Javier Guerra Sandoval, personal communication 1998). By the 1757
census, Ramón Guerra and Rosalia Hinojosa had three children. Their property
included weapons, four horses, and three mules.
Several subsequent sets of census data survive for Mier, including for the
years 1782, 1790, 1800, and a partial census from approximately 1817. Using this
combination of genealogical information, land grant records, and census data, it is
possible to trace the descendents of the pobladores who founded El Rancho San
Lorenzo de las Minas, which is a likely candidate for the precursor to Rancho El
Saladito.
1782 Census of Mier
In the 1782 census under Rancho de San Lorenzo are listed two families
along with their ages (Overstreet 1990:12):

María Rosalia Hinojosa died in Mier on June 14, 1773. Ramón Guerra, the
widower, appears in this census nine years later living with his children on the
ranch. The family of his married son, Alvino Guerra, constitutes the remainder of
the ranch’s population. The order that the ranches appear in the 1782 census and a
crosscheck of the inhabitants shows that Gervacio Hinojosa, who received Mier
Porción 8, founded El Rancho San Francisco. Juan Francisco Sáenz, who received
Mier Porción 7, follows Gervacio in the census under the heading Rancho Las
Flores. Ramón Guerra, who received Mier Porción 6 comes next in the 1782
census followed by El Rancho San Salvador del Santiago Barrera, who received
Mier Porción 2 (Overstreet 1990). Thus, as we follow the census taker’s route
from the town’s center, we get an idea of the layout of the neighborhood and the
vast stretches of territory that separated the ranches.

122

1790 Census of Mier
In the 1790 census there is not a heading for El Rancho San Lorenzo, but
the following entries are sandwiched between those given for El Rancho Las
Flores and El Rancho Salvador, consistent with the order of ranches as they appear
in the 1782 census. Three families along with their ages are listed (Overstreet
1990:36-37):

Clearly Ramón Guerra lived a long and prosperous life. He is 73 years old
and still listed as head of a household, although it is likely that his two oldest

123

children who were still at home, Juana and Vicente, would have cared for him and
the ranch. I have been unable to determine when Ramón Guerra died. Likely he
died soon after this census was taken given his age and the fact that both Juana and
Vicente marry shortly thereafter. Juana marries José Antonio Peña on October 17,
1790. Vicente marries María Josefa Ramírez on November 22, 1791. It is not clear
who was the parent of Antonia, age 4. She represents the only new addition to the
family since the last census.
In other developments since the previous census, Alejandro Guerra married
María Luzgarda Garcia on March 3, 1783 and they are listed with three children in
the 1790 census. His brother Alvino has three additional children with his wife
María Rosalia Salinas, for a total of eight.
1800 Census of Mier
In the 1800 census under Rancho de San Lorenzo are listed five families
along with their ages (Overstreet 1990: 66-67):

I must first point out an error in the above data from the 1800 census of
Mier. There is either a recording or a transcription error with Antonio Alvino
Guerra’s age of 34. He is probably between the ages of 42 to 44, based on his age
in the 1782 census of 26 and his age in the 1790 census of 32. He is two years
younger than his wife Rosalia Salinas in 1782, but four years younger than her in
the 1790 census. Rosalia Salinas’ age is consistently recorded in the three sets of
data: 28 in 1782; 36 in 1780; and 46 in 1800.
The five families of El Rancho San Lorenzo all consist of the married
children of Ramón Guerra and María Rosalia Hinojosa and their families. Alvino

125

Guerra is the oldest and his family also appears in the 1782 and 1790 censuses.
María Guadalupe Guerra and her husband, José de los Santos Ramírez, constitute
a family without children. Her husband may be related to María Josefa Ramírez,
the widow of Guadalupe’s brother Vicente, who has a child named José de los
Santos Guerra. Alejandro Guerra and his wife Lugarda (spelled Luzgarza in other
places) García have six children, including the youngest Espiridiona, who is my
great-great-great grandmother on my maternal grandfather’s line.
Besides María Josefa Ramírez another widow is listed as head of a family.
María Catarina Guerra originally married José Antonio Gregorio Sanchez on
November 16, 1775. Her daughters bear the last name Sanchez in later marriage
and census records (SAGA publications 1989; Galindo 1999). It is significant that
this family does not appear associated with El Rancho de San Lorenzo in the two
previous censuses cited. Apparently Catarina Guerra returns to her family’s ranch
after the death of her husband. Their family is listed as among those living within
the town in both the 1782 and 1790 censuses. As we will see in the next example,
her daughters continue to call the ranch home after they themselves marry.
1817 Census of Mier
For the next part of the discussion, I refer to a partial census from
approximately 1817 that I encountered among a private collection of historical
documents while doing my thesis research in Mier (Galindo 1999). This partial
census documents the residents and livestock of eight ranchos, including San
Pedro de las Flores, San Lorenzo de las Minas, Santo Tomas de Sabinitas, Santa
Barbara de Morteritos, Santa Teresa de Guardado, San José de la Rinconada, San
Gregorio del Saleno, and Jesus de Buenavista. A summary of the census data for
126

the eight ranches is given in Table 13. According to this partial census, I have
reconstructed the family tree for the residents of San Lorenzo de las Minas (Figure
22).

By 1817 El Rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas continues to be occupied by
the descendents of three children of Ramón Guerra and María Rosalia Hinojosa.
Their son Alejandro is the oldest resident at age 59. He married September 6, 1813

130

for a second time after the death of his wife Luzgarda Garcia. According to this
census he lives with María de la Carmen Barrera and children from his first
marriage. Alejandro’s daughter María Casilda Guerra lives with the family, perhaps
with her three-year-old son, José Cesario.
María Josefa Ramírez, the widow of Ramón and Rosalia’s son Vicente,
continues to reside on the ranch even though she has since remarried and had three
more children. Within their family we see for the first time a household member
that does not appear to be related by blood or marriage. One possibility is that
Ygnacio de la Cruz may be a laborer who resides with the family. José María
Guerra is the son of Vicente Guerra and María Josefa Ramírez. He and his wife,
María Faustina Barrera, reside here with their two children.
María Catarina Guerra is the daughter of Ramón and Rosalia. At 57 she is
the oldest woman living at the ranch, second only to her brother Alejandro. She
remarried September 12, 1802 to Juan José Alvarez. They live with their son José
Antonio Alvarez. María Francisca Sanchez is the daughter of María Catarina
Guerra and her first husband A. Sanchez. She has married since the last census and
now resides on the ranch with her husband, José Antonio Guadiano. Josefa
Sanchez is also a daughter of María Catarina Guerra and A. Sanchez. She has also
married since the last census and now resides on the ranch with her husband,
Lazaro Bela, and their six children. María Petra Alvaren’s last name is probably
correctly spelled “Alvarez” and she is likely the daughter of Juan José Alvarez
from his first marriage. She resides here with her husband Blas Perez and their two
children.

131

María Manuela Guerra is the daughter of Alvino Guerra and Rosalia
Salinas. She and her husband José Rafael González live on the ranch with their five
children. María Guadalupe Guerra is also the daughter of Alvino and Rosalia. She
and her husband Santos continue to reside on the ranch raising their seven
children. José Angel Guerra is the son of Alvino and Rosalia. He is married to
Rosalia Hinojosa and they have three children. José Hilario Guerra is another son
of Alvino and Rosalia. He and his wife, María Nicolasa Garza, reside here with
their two children.
Summary of Census Data
In summary, after approximately 70 years of occupation the population of
the ranch continued to increase as the family grew through marriages and births.
For the nearly 40 years that documentation is available, this steady growth is
observable as the population increased from 15 people in two families in 1782 to
63 people in 11 families by 1817. The familial ties that bind these people are also
clearly evident in all but one case. With the exception of Ygnacio de la Cruz, all
ranch residents are members of an extended family descending from two of the
original pobladores of Mier, Ramón Guerra and María Rosalia Hinojosa.
Livestock Holdings in 1817
The 1817 census includes information on the livestock holdings of the
ranch residents. The following table summarizes the property of the residents of El
Rancho San Lorenzo (Galindo 1999):

Alejandro Guerra, the oldest surviving son of Ramón Guerra and Rosalia
Hinojosa, has a significant amount of property: 400 sheep, 36 goats, eight head of
cattle, five horses and two mules. The only other two owners of significant
amounts of livestock are related to the ranch and the descendents of the Ramón
Guerra family through marriage.
Ramón Barrera married Josefa Ramírez, the widow of Vicente Guerra,
who was Alejandro’s brother. He is 12 years younger than Alejandro, but he
controls the most livestock at the ranch: 800 sheep, 300 goats, eight head of cattle,
28 horses, and eight mules. Ramón and Alejandro are the only ones at the ranch to
own goats.
Santos Ramírez married María Guadalupe Guerra, Alejandro’s niece and
the daughter of Alvino and Rosalia Guerra. He is the same age as Ramón Barrera
and controls the following amounts of livestock: 200 sheep, five head of cattle, and
one mule. Together with Ramón and Alejandro, Santos is among the only ones at
the ranch to own sheep.
In terms of the variety of livestock, sheep are the most common, followed
by goats, then horses, cattle, and mules. Everyone except José Rafael Gonzalez

133

owns at least one cow, the greatest quantity being eight. The next most commonly
owned animal is the mule, as six out of eight have at least one. Again the greatest
quantity is eight. Finally, at least one horse is owned by five of the six propertied
ranch residents. Most people own five or fewer horses, but Ramón Barrera owns
28.
Property ownership at El Rancho de San Lorenzo exhibits some interesting
trends. First, age does not appear to correlate with wealth. Although Alejandro is
the oldest son of the original founders of the ranch, he does not own the most
property. Second, marriages have contributed significantly to the wealth of the
ranch by incorporating the property of in-laws. Third, the distribution of livestock
may indicate specialization by certain families in breeding or training certain
animals to the exclusion of others. This specialization likely influenced the spatial
arrangement of settlements across the landscape.
Other Disturbances
The Rancho El Saladito has been used throughout the centuries for livestock grazing, plow farming, and the mining of different kinds of stone; therefore,
many areas are partially or completely altered. Fortunately, with the exception of
occasionally grading the roads, the excavation area of Operation 1 remains relatively unaltered, except by the action of wind and water erosion. The preservation
of the material culture of Operation 2 is of a different nature, mainly because the
area is still utilized by the owners. The yard of the house is periodically graded by
machine along with the rest of the dirt road, which has displaced artifacts and
obliterated activity areas. Jacales have fallen down or been replaced with concrete
patios. For these reasons, the two habitation areas on either side of the Arroyo
134

Saladito contribute differently to our knowledge of past rancho settlements.
Among Operation 2 artifacts, for example, are 57 metal objects (many of them
farming implements) weighing 1,545 grams; meanwhile, very few metal objects
were recovered in Operation 1. This difference may be simply because Operation 2
represents a twentieth-century occupation and more metal implements were used
compared to earlier times. Alternatively, all metal objects may have been taken
from Operation 1, either by their owners as they left or by the new owners as they
moved to the west side of the arroyo in the 1920s.
Field and Laboratory Methodology
Introduction
This section describes the pre-field planning, the field methods of the
mapping/surveying and excavation phases, subsequent analysis of the cultural
material recovered, and its preparation for curation.
Pre-field Planning
Other chapters in this dissertation represent the extensive pre-field planning
that preceded the mapping and excavation phases. Historical background research
was conducted in the archives in Mier, at the Benson Latin American Collection at
the University of Texas at Austin, and at the Catholic Archives of Texas. An effort
was made to locate, collect, and incorporate the works of Mexican scholars and
local historians. Census data for the area were located with the assistance of Myra
Stanwick of the Spanish American Genealogical Association of Corpus Christi, the
same organization that has published several volumes containing the earliest
demographic data available for Nuevo Santander colonists. Additionally, several

135

visits were made to the Rancho El Saladito over a five year period to survey and
determine the extent of the archaeological deposits in preparation for this project.
Field Methods
Unit Excavations
Operation 1: East Side of the Arroyo El Saladito
All excavations were conducted using the metric system. The excavation
phase began September 21, 2002 on the east side of the Arroyo El Saladito and
terminated October 4, 2002. The east side excavations were designated Operation
1 and targeted the area of earliest occupation by Spanish colonists. Within this
framework, nine Suboperations (designated A through H) with a total of 49 lots
were excavated (Table 16). The equivalent of 36 1m2-units were excavated to
varying depths in arbitrary 10-cm levels. Twenty of these units terminated at the 20
cm below surface level, although two others reached the 50 cm and 100 cm levels.
In general, the artifacts were concentrated in the upper 20 cm of matrix. The 20-30
cm level was virtually sterile in all units, while sterility below the 30 cm level was
consistent. In total, Operation 1 involved the removal of 9.5 m3 of matrix.

Operation 2: West Side of the Arroyo El Saladito
Excavations then moved to the west side of the Arroyo El Saladito on
October 14, 2002 and terminated four days later. The west side excavations were
designated Operation 2. Within this framework, three Suboperations (designated A
through C) with a total of 18 lots, were excavated. The equivalent of eight 1m2units were excavated to varying depths in 10-cm levels (Table 17).

Eleven of the lots were part of Suboperation A, which investigated the
cooking horno. Two other 1m2 units were excavated, one located six meters from
the southwest corner of the extant stone building, and the other placed outside the
fenced yard, but about 10 meters southeast of the cooking horno ruins. No other
excavations were attempted on the west side of the arroyo as part of Operation 2
because of the disturbed nature of the deposits. The area around the extant house
has been repeatedly graded by machine, thus disturbing the artifacts and their
context. In total, Operation 2 involved the removal of 2.64 m3 of matrix, for a
project total of 12.14 m3 from the equivalent of 44 1m2-units.
Placement of Suboperations
Operation 1: East Side of the Arroyo El Saladito
Based on the mapping and surveying phase, excavation units on the east
side of the Arroyo El Saladito were placed according to surface finds of ceramic,
glass, or metal objects (Figures 23 and 24). Alternatively, units were placed atop
areas where numerous artifacts were evident on the surface after eroding out of
the sides of the arroyo. Initially there were two main areas of large surface

138

scatters; the first was tested with Suboperations A and B and is located near the
northernmost tip of the triangle of land formed by the arroyo to the west and the
Río Grande to the east. The second area is along the elevated bank of the arroyo
and was designated Suboperation C. The two areas are interesting for the contrast
in ceramic components that they each contain. Suboperations A and B revealed the
oldest Central Mexican majolicas at the site, while Suboperation C produced
mainly Englishwares dating after the 1820s.
Suboperation D is located about 50 meters south of Suboperations A and
B. This areas was tested with a 1 X 3 meter unit placed near where an engraved
metal utensil handle was found on the surface (Figure 25). The initials “J.B.,”
presumably of the engraver, appear on the reverse side of the handle along with

Figure 23: Detailed map of the Operation 1 excavations on the east side of the arroyo at Rancho
El Saladito.

Rancho El Saladito.

three decorative elements: a flower, a clover, and a crown. Despite the interesting
surface artifacts encountered in this area, the excavation revealed very few artifacts
in situ.
Suboperation E is located about 56 meters southwest of Suboperation D
and about 77 meters east of Suboperation C. It represents an area to the east of the
two dirt roads that presumably has not been disturbed, based on its elevated height
in comparison to the road surface level. Again, the placement of two 1-X-3-meter
units was determined based on surface finds and topography. Excavations were

140

placed near the location of surface
finds but an effort was made to identify
and clear the highest nearby elevation
in preparation for excavation. The
stratigraphy of all Operation 1 deposits
proved to be consistent, with the
exception of the southern unit of
Suboperation E. Here the top 10-cm

utensil handle from the surface collection

layer was virtually sterile, containing
only one ceramic sherd. The next 10cm layer contained more artifacts than

the upper layer, including a variety of ceramic types. The third 10-cm layer again
was practically sterile, with only a few bone fragments.
The majority of artifacts in Operation 1 units were consistently contained
within the top 20 cm of the excavations. No other unit had a sterile top 10-cm
layer. A consideration of the site’s formation processes helps explain this anomaly.
The prickly pear cactus plant that was removed to accommodate the excavation
unit was no doubt responsible for maintaining or accumulating soil beneath its
roots. Thus, the elevated surface area thought to represent a preserved living or
activity level had actually been elevated by the accumulation of soil beneath the
cactus. The bioturbation of the cactus’ roots had drawn the single ceramic sherd
upward from the cultural level.

141

Suboperation F is located between the two dirt roads in an area presumably
undisturbed by the road building and maintaining. The surface level in this area is
slightly elevated from the surface of the roads. The two excavation units were
placed based on the surface finds of plainware and majolicas in the area. Both units
contained very low artifact density, with most of the deposits concentrated in the
top 10 centimeters. The second 10-cm layer in one unit was practically sterile and
no artifacts were found in the same level of the other unit.
Suboperation G was located while clearing brush to facilitate the mapping
of the datums in Suboperation F. It is about 30 meters north of Suboperation F and
also located in the area between the two roads. Two discoveries contributed to
placement of two 1 X 3 meter excavation units for Suboperation G. The first was a
surface find in the road next to the subop of an iron ruido, complete with three
coscojos. Ruidos, or noisemakers, were used on saddles by Spanish soldiers during
the mid-eighteenth century (Simmons and Turley 1980:114-115). Some accounts
say they helped calm nervous horses, while others say the sound helped the horse
maintain a certain pace (Simmons and Turley 1980:115). Ruidos consist of two
elements: a higa and three attached coscojos. Two more higas (ruidos without the
cascojones) would be encountered in Suboperation G excavations (Figure 26).
The second clue was a surface scattering of artifacts that would not have
been revealed except the mapping crew was trying to take one more shot down a
winding road without moving the TDS. After all, swinging the machete can be
faster and easier than leveling the TDS anew. That was not the case this time as no
matter how much brush was removed, the angle of the shot remained impossible to
attain. We ended up moving the TDS to get the shot, but the effort was not wasted
142

as the clearing revealed a surface
scattering of artifacts at a significantly
higher density than what had been
observed nearby at Suboperation F.
This area was designated Suboperation
G.
Suboperation H is located
nearly 200 meters southeast of
Suboperations A and B. It was located
by pedestrian survey through the
presence of ceramic and metal artifacts
on the surface. It is very near both the
Río Grande and the property line.

ruido from Operation 1, Suboperation G
excavations and surface collection.

Operation 2: West Side of the Arroyo El Saladito

Excavation units on the west side of the Arroyo El Saladito were placed to
examine the construction of the horno and according to surface finds of ceramic,
glass, and metal objects. Suboperation A of Operation 2 was placed so that the
eastern half of the horno would be excavated. The horno was not dissasembled;
rather the matrix around it was removed to document the method of construction.
Suboperation B was placed close to the stone structure and in an area that did not
appear to have been regularly machine graded. Suboperation C was located
outside the fenced yard in an area where many surface artifacts were collected.

143

Mapping and Surveying
Operation 1: East Side of the Arroyo El Saladito
Mapping and surveying began August 23, 2002, with the assistance of Ruth
A. Mathews, and Antonia Figueroa Gonzalez. The mapping began on the east side
of the Arroyo El Saladito near the highway, which borders the ranch on the south
side. Initial understanding of the distance from the highway entrance of the ranch
to the area of oldest occupation by Spanish colonial settlers proved to be sorely
underestimated. Instead of being able to contain the east side occupation sites
within a 1 km2 grid as planned, it was necessary to include an area approximately
2.5 km long by 1.5 km wide. The east side settlements were concentrated in the
northern 200 meters long by 150 meters wide (Figure 27). Most of the ranch
between the highway and the area of oldest settlement is disturbed by recent road
building and gravel quarrying.
Prehistoric deposits in the form of projectile points, unifacial and bifacial
scrapers, debitage, and crude tools are visible on the surface in an area along the
western baseline of the map grid. Besides those artifacts associated with the
aforementioned Spanish colonial settlement, these were the only other
archaeological materials observed east of the arroyo.
The mapping phase initially established control points within the area of
earliest occupation on the east side of the Arroyo El Saladito. The process of
mapping continued throughout the excavation phase as areas were cleared and
datums and units were defined.

144

along the Arroyo El Saladito.

145

Operation 2: West Side of the Arroyo El Saladito
The settlement on the west side of the Arroyo El Saladito was mapped
within an area 650 meters long by 250 meters wide. It includes a stone building,
the ruins of a cooking horno, the ruins of a lime kiln, the ruins of a stone dam, a
building block quarry site, and a natural spring along the arroyo’s left bank (Figure
27). Based on oral history (Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra,
personal communication 2002), the extant stone house was built shortly after her
father, Adolfo Hinojosa Saenz, purchased the ranch in 1928 (Figure 16 on page
113). It was built by Francisco Hinojosa Barrera of Los Guerras using stone
recycled from a nearby cooking horno and additional blocks from the quarry.
According to Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra, the dam was either
newly built by her father or else he refurbished an older construction (personal
communication 2002). Regardless, the dam provided fresh drinking water to the
inhabitants, crucial because the sulfurous nature of the arroyo waters rendered it
unpalatable except to livestock. However, the sulfurous waters and associated clay
were used by humans for recreational and medicinal purposes (Doña María Berta
Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra, personal communication 2002).
Equipment and Procedure
The mapping equipment used for this project was a Sokkia Set 4 Total
Data Station (TDS) along with a SR-33 data collector. The Mesoamerican
Archaeological Research Laboratory provided the TDS, while the Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory furnished the data collector. Bruce Moses of
the Center for Archeological Research at UTSA provided several training sessions
for the mapping crew prior to the fieldwork.
146

Mapping at Rancho El Saladito began near the southeast gate on the east
side of the Arroyo El Saladito, which bisects the rancho. A control point near the
south fence line was established by driving a metal rod into the ground and then
designated “North 1000, East 1000.” This control point was also tied in with a
nearby cement utility pole, which made a convenient permanent reference point.
Mapping proceeded due north, establishing control points every 50 meters, until
the east bank of the Arroyo El Saladito prevented the mapping crew from
continuing in a northerly direction (Figure 28).
From Control Point 8, the mapping proceeded due east until the ranch’s
eastern fenceline was encountered (Control Point 12). At this point the mapping
crew attempted to again proceed due north, but the vegetation was quite thick and
clearing brechas proved to be unworkable given the amount of time we had for the
project. It also became evident that the area of earliest occupation was twice as far
from the road as had been previously estimated by the landowner and the author.
The mapping strategy had to be adjusted to include a larger area and to
compensate for the thick underbrush.
To speed up our arrival at the area of archaeological interest, the mapping
crew began to follow the dirt road as it winded through the ranch’s gravel quarries.
It took about 20 shots to reach the end of the road where an arroyo leads to the
Río Grande (Río Bravo del Norte). These east side settlements were concentrated
in an area roughly 200 meters long by 150 meters wide (Figure 28). Based on
ceramic analysis, the oldest occupation is near the end of the dirt road, where a
triangle of land is formed, bounded by the Arroyo El Saladito on the west and the

147

Figure 28: Detail of mapping effort along the east road and in crossing the arroyo at Rancho El
Saladito.

148

Río Grande to the east. Across the Río Grande from the Rancho El Saladito is La
Isla, the largest of four islands in this part of the river.
According to oral tradition, the eighteenth-century pobladores established
their ranch on the east side of the Arroyo El Saladito near the most important
resource for themselves and their livestock: fresh river water (Doña María Berta
Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra, personal communication 2002). Archival sources
document the Spanish colonial tendency to keep livestock on the north bank of the
Río Grande, while the colonists lived and farmed on the south bank (Casteñeda
1938:vol. 2, p. 172). Further evidence of the widespread nature of this practice is a
1792 map of Nuevo Santander that illustrates the ranching communities on the
north bank associated with each Revilla, Mier, Camargo, and Reynosa (Figures 29
and 30).
During the twentieth century, the ranch house was moved to the west side
of the Arroyo El Saladito, where a dam on an arm of the arroyo was constructed
to provide fresh water. Descendents cite the desire to be closer to town and to the
road among the motivations behind the move (Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez
de Guerra, personal communication 2002).
The control points along the dirt road were used as references for
subsequent and more detailed surveying. The mapping process continued
throughout the excavation phase as overgrown areas were cleared and datums and
units were established. Meanwhile, to complete the initial mapping phase, it was
necessary to get across the Arroyo El Saladito and to connect the two areas of
settlement on the map. For this the crew returned to Control Point 8, where a
temporary datum was established atop a nearby hill and designated TD 5 (Figure

28). From the hill it was possible to clearly see across the arroyo and into the yard
surrounding the ranch house. In this manner we established a control point in the
yard (Control Point 13) that could be used to orient the map on the west side and
tie the two maps together. Actual mapping of the west side, however, did not begin
until excavations were complete on the east side.
Initially, mapping on the west side concentrated on the structures inside the
fenced yard surrounding the ranch house and including the out buildings. The ruins
of a cooking horno were documented in the south corner of the yard and the area
around it was cleared of vegetation to prepare for excavations. The area to the
south, east, and west of the fenced yard was explored until the thick vegetation of
the arroyo prevented further passage. The mapping continued to the northeast
along a dirt road that followed a side channel of the arroyo, past the ruins of the
lime kiln and the dam (Figures 32 through 37). The road “ends” at the buildingstone quarry, an area with several bedrock outcroppings near the intersection with
the main channel of the Arroyo El Saladito (Figures 38 and 39). At this point of the
arroyo, the floor of the channel consists of a layer of exposed bedrock forming a
flat, regular surface that is very easy to walk across when the water is low (Figure
40). In fact, the “end” of another road on the opposite bank indicates that this spot
has served as a convenient crossing point for some time.
About 300 meters north of this crossing point and along the west bank is
the sulfurous spring head. The stretch of land between the quarry and the spring is
notable. Immediately northwest of the quarry are eroding sandy bluffs (Figures 41
and 42). Stone tools were recovered here on the surface, most likely after eroding
(Text continues on page 156.)

down from the tops of the bluffs. Salt can be seen coating the ground around the
base of the bluffs.
Between the crossing at the quarry and the Río Grande, the Arroyo
Saladito widens out and fills with water (Figure 43). The stretch of arroyo from
the crossing point to the springs and probably beyond is a geologic curiousity in
that one can see bubbles rising from numerous gas vents below the water surface
(Figure 44). The largest gas bubbles emerge from the spring itself (Figure 45). I
witnessed that it is possible to light the emanating gas; however, I was told the
effect is more dramatic at night (Figure 46). From this source flows enough cool
sulphurous water to maintain the level of the arroyo downstream from the spring
to the Río Grande, even during the summer (Figure 47). South of this point, the
water flow of the arroyo is little to non-existant unless runoff water is flowing after
a rain.
Figure 48 is a topographic map of the Operation 2 excavations and the
related features on the west side, including the stone house, a cooking horno, a
lime kiln, a dam, and a building stone quarry. Figure 49 is a photo of the house and
fenced area from the opposite side of the arroyo. The terrain to the southwest of
the stone house and fenced yard gently slopes to the arroyo and was farmed by the
twentieth-century inhabitants (Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra,
personal communication 2002). The lime kiln is located in an area of eroded sandy
hills that lie along a side channel of the arroyo. The lime produced here was used
to make the plaster for the stone building, according to oral history (Doña María
Berta Hinojosa Gómez de Guerra, personal communication 2002). The lime was
made by burning river shells and fossilized oyster shells. Limestone river pebbles,

because of their heat-retaining properties. The top of the bluff where the kiln is
located is covered with these blue-gray stones, however the bluff is made of sand
with little to no naturally-ocurring stone. Large building stones are visible downhill
from the eroding lime kiln and suggest that these may have been used in the kiln
construction (Figures 32 and 33 on page 155).

The same side channel continues north-northwest to the dam, less than 200
meters away. The dam was constructed of stone and took advantage of the
narrowing of a side channel of the main arroyo. Remnants of the original
contruction are visible along the west bank, while several large stones that are still
cemented together sit in the bottom of the channel (Figures 34 through 37 on page
155). Extensive topographic shots were not possible in the area of the dam
because of thick vegetation and a lack of time and resources.
Photographic and Other Types of Documentation
All photographic documentation of the excavations and artifacts was
accomplished digitally with a Nikon CoolPix 995 (supplied by the Mesoamerican
Archaeological Research Lab at the University of Texas at Austin).
Plan views and profiles were drawn for Suboperation 2A, the only excavation unit that involved an architectural feature. Architectural drawings were made
of the stone structure at Rancho El Saladito and are presented in Chapter 7.

160

Labratory Methods
Artifact Analysis
The washing and preparing of the artifacts for analysis occurred during
days that the weather prevented fieldwork. Thus, the cataloguing and analyzing of
the artifacts was able to commence immediately following the fieldwork phases on
October 21, 2002. Ten days later the analysis was complete. Recording efforts
beyong the mapping of the site included taking digital photographs of the artifacts
and rendering architectural drawings of the four sides and plan view of the stone
building.
Artifacts recovered in excavations and from surface collecting included
objects of ceramic, lithic, shell, bone, metal, and glass. A total of 2,407 artifacts
weighing 3,246 g were recorded from both sides of the Arroyo El Saladito. Of this
total, 90% of the quantity, or 2,161 artifacts weighing 544.8 g were recovered on
the east side of the arroyo from Operation 1. Although smaller in number, the
artifacts from Operation 2 on the west side of the arroyo actually weigh much
more (2701.2 g) because the total includes 57 metal objects.
Artifacts were separated into classifications and then counted and weighed.
Ceramic sherds were further separated into various types, including Galera,
Majolica, Mier Plain, and Glazewares. The sherds were then counted and weighed
within this framework. Pursuant to the permit for this project, all artifacts were
delivered to the INAH office in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, México (on
November 7, 2002), for curation along with copies of all the excavation forms and
the laboratory analysis paperwork. Copies of these documents are also on file at
TARL, along with digital images of the artifacts.
161

Analysis Procedure
The artifact analysis portion of this project was accomplished in a field
laboratory set up in one room of an apartment in Mier, Tamaulipas, Mexico, during
October 21-31, 2002. Equipment for the laboratory was provided by MARL and
TARL. The patio of the apartment was used to wash and dry artifacts.
Artifacts were separated into six categories, including ceramic, lithic, land
snail, aquatic shell, bone, and metal. After dividing them into categories, the
artifacts were counted and weighed with a digital scale. Land snails were discarded
after counting and weighing. All other artifacts were bagged separately in plastic
zip baggies, including a piece of acid-free paper with each, which contained the
provenience, quantity, and weight. The lithic and ceramic artifacts received further
examination. Lithic artifacts were divided into tools, projectile points, primary
flakes, secondary flakes, tertiary flakes, and shatter, all of which were
manufactured from chert. Primary flakes have 50-100% cortex on their outer
surface. Secondary flakes have 0-49% cortex and tertiary flakes have no cortex.
Shatter lacks diagnostic features like bulbs of percussion, but likely represents a
by-product of hard hammer lithic manufacturing.
Ceramic artifacts were divided into eight types: Galera Wares, Majolica,
Burnished Redware, Mier Plain Unglazed, Glazed wares, English wares, black slip,
and black on cream. The first six of these were the most common. English wares
were further divided and described based on the design, color(s), or technique.
Curation
Cultural material processed by the field laboratory in Mier was washed, airdried, and stored in archival-quality bags. Acid-free labels were placed in all
162

artifact bags. Each bag was labeled with a provenience. Artifacts were separated
by class into individual bags, but all bags with the same provenience were placed
together in an appropriately labeled archival-quality bag. Acid-free copies of the
field notes, excavation and laboratory forms, and drawings are on file with the
Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas office of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e
Historia, and on file at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory. All of the
artifacts and paperwork were taken to the INAH office in Ciudad Victoria (on
November 7, 2002), where they are curated according to the requirements of
Permit 401-36/0848 from the Consejo de Arqueología del INAH. Compact discs
containing digital photographs of the excavations and artifacts are also on file with
INAH and TARL.
Conclusions
Archival and genealogical research document a steady rate of growth at
San Lorenzo de las Minas, the likely precursor to Rancho El Saladito. The rancho
population increased from 15 people in two families in 1782 to 63 people in 11
families by 1817. Marriages and the subsequent incorporation of in-laws’ property
to the rancho contributed greatly to its economic success. The distribution of
livestock indicates apparent specialization by certain families in breeding or training certain animals to the exclusion of others. Such specialization would have
influenced the spatial arrangement of settlements across the landscape. The placement of the excavations described in the next chapter was based on ethnohistorical
information and the location of artifacts on the surface.

163

Chapter 7: Results and Discussions of Investigations
Introduction
Excavations were divided into two operations, one on each side of the
Arroyo El Saladito. Operation 1 encompasses the east side of the arroyo, where
the earliest settlement took place. Operation 2 is the west side of the arroyo, the
site of a mainly twentieth-century occupation.
Operation 1, Suboperation A
Description
Suboperation A is at the north end of Rancho El Saladito, near the
confluence of the Arroyo El Saladito and the Rio Grande (Figure 27 on page 146).
It is located in the northernmost area examined, where numerous Majolica sherds
were observed eroding into the arroyo. It is also near where one of the landowners
remembered encountering the foundation stones of a previous structure (Gil Javier
Guerra, personal communication 2002). His grandmother remembered jacales in
the same area when her father bought the ranch in 1928 (Berta Hinojosa de
Guerra, personal communication 2002). No structures, however, were
encountered in the survey or excavations of Operation 1. Suboperation B is about
six meters from Suboperation A and the two should be considered elements of the
same suboperation, regardless of their nomenclature. The two excavation units
received distinct suboperation designations because they were open

Operation 2
Introduction
Whereas Operation 1 encompassed the east side of the arroyo and the
earliest settlements, Operation 2 involves survey and excavation on the west side
of the arroyo, where a mainly twentieth-century occupation is evident. A few glass
and iron artifacts from the nineteenth century encountered here may have been
recycled or they may represent the occupation that preceded the Hinojosa family’s
rancho. Features encountered include a one-room, native stone house with an
indoor chiminea (or cooking hearth), the ruins of an horno (or outdoor baking
oven), the remnants of a calera (or lime kiln), a dam on a side tributary of the
arroyo, and a sulfurous water spring (Figure 27 on page 146). Operation 2
excavations are divided into three suboperations: A, B, and C. Suboperation A
investigates the outdoor cooking horno, excavating the east side of the feature in
11 lots. Suboperation B tests the area near the stone house, while Suboperation C
tests the area outside the fenced yard.
Operation 2, Suboperation A
Description
Suboperation A is the investigation of the ruins of an outdoor cooking, or
baking horno, associated with the twentieth-century occupation of Rancho El
Saladito (Figures 63 and 64), and perhaps an earlier occupation. The horno was
associated with a nearby jacal that housed the ranch’s workers during the first half
207

of the twentieth century (Berta Hinojosa de Guerra personal communication,
2002). No archaeological evidence for the location of the jacal was encountered,
which attests to the difficulty of locating such structures archaeologically.
Excavations revealed two courses of stone on top of footing stones at the base of
the horno (Figure 64). According to oral history, stones from the horno were used
to construct the house (Gil Javier Guerra personal communication, 2002). The
dismantled state of the horno, collaborated by this information from oral history,
together suggest a previous occupation, perhaps during the mid- to late-nineteenth
century.
Excavations were divided into 11 lots. The size of the final excavation was
2-X-3 meters2, minus a small portion of the horno that was not excavated within
this boundary (Figure 65).

Lot 1
Lot 1 of Suboperation A was a 1m2 unit located to the immediate east of
the horno’s east corner. The horno measures 1.75 X 1.40 meters and stands
between 40 and 50 centimeters high. A banqueta, or sidewalk, was revealed in this
lot, which probably marks the horno’s opening. Lot 1 was the upper 10
centimeters of the matrix and contained a lone artifact that was collected—a bolt
or rivet that weighs 14.2 grams (Figure 66). There were also five pieces of
209

unidentifiable metal scraps that were
observed, but not collected. Also
observed were two land snails, two
brown glass shards, limestone and grey
cobble chink stones, a wire nail, some
wood, and a metal and fake pearl snap
button with bits of red cloth attached.
FIGURE 66. A bolt or rivet recovered from
Operation 2, Suboperation A, Lot 1.

Lot 2
Lot 2 of Suboperation A was

the 10-centimeter level below Lot 1. The banqueta revealed in Lot 1 was not
removed, but the excavation of Lot 2 continued to the east of the platform to
determine if another course of stone was below. No further courses of the
banqueta were revealed, but it became evident in profile that it stretched the length
of the base of the horno along the southeast side and beyond. The matrix contained
small white limestone gravel and fewer sandstone chunks than Lot 1.
Artifacts collected as part of Lot 2 consist of four bone fragments that
weigh 3.4 grams. Two of these fragments appear to be from a small rodent.
Artifacts observed, but not collected, include a brown glass shard, a land snail, and
two aluminum grommets in leather.
Lot 3
Lot 3 of Suboperation A was below Lot 2 and involved the matrix from 20
to 30 centimeters below surface. No artifacts were collected as part of Lot 3;
however, objects such as four wire nails, three land snails, clear bottle glass shards,
a plastic button, and a .22 bullet casing were all observed.
210

Lot 4
Lot 4 of Suboperation A was below Lot 3 and involved the matrix from 30
to 40 centimeters below surface. No artifacts were collected as part of Lot 4;
however, eleven land snails were observed.
Lot 5
Lot 5 of Suboperation A was a 1-X-2 meter extention, adjacent at the
northwest corner of the original 1m2 unit. A portion of this unit, about 0.5 meter2
in the northwest corner, was actually part of the horno. This corner was cleaned to
reveal the principle construction stones, but not dismantled.
Lot 5 contained seven bone fragments that weigh 45.4 grams, including
two vertebrae from a small mammal. Other artifacts that were observed, but not
collected, include four wire nails, seven land snails, two clear glass shards, and
another metal and fake pearl snap button.
Lot 6
Lot 6 of Suboperation A was an 1m2 extension to the immediate south of
the original unit (Lots 1-4). Lot 6 was east of Lot 5 and involved the upper 10
centimeters of matrix. Collected from Lot 6 were 21 glass fragments, weighing
57.8 grams. All fragments appear to be from a rectangular-shaped bottle with a
metal cap. The bottle glass has a corrugated texture. Artifacts that were observed,
but not collected, include two pieces of brown glass, two land snails, a nut and bolt
fused together, a wire nail, and an iron scrap.
Lot 7
Lot 7 of Suboperation A was the 10-centimeter layer of matrix below Lot
6. Lot 7 contained two glass fragments that weigh 2.3 grams. One is a purple or
211

magnesium glass shard. The other is clear and corrugated, likely from the same
bottle collected in Lot 6. Other artifacts observed, but not collected, include three
pieces of unidentifiable metal and three land snails.
Lot 8
Lot 8 of Suboperation A was the matrix below Lot 5, but only in the
southern half of the original 2-X-2 m2 unit. Excavations revealed the remaining
stones comprising the banqueta adjacent to the horno. They also revealed the
southeast face of the horno (Figure 67).
Lot 8 contained two bone fragments that weigh 4.7 grams. Wire nails were
observed in the matrix, but not collected.
Lot 9
Lot 9 of Suboperation A was the upper 10 centimeters of matrix in a 1m2
extension north of Lots 1-4. Lot 9 contained one clear, rectangular glass fragment

that weighs 7.5 grams and appears to be the base of the same bottle collected in
Lots 6 and 7, although no reconstruction was attempted. The northern end of the
banqueta adjacent to the horno was determined with the termination of Lot 9.
Lot 10
Lot 10 of Suboperation A was a 50 centimeter layer in a 1m2 extension
west of Lot 9. A portion of this unit, less than 0.5 m2 in the southwest corner, was
actually part of the horno. This corner was cleaned to reveal the principle
construction stones in both plan view and profile, but was not dismantled.
Lot 10 revealed the footing stones upon which the horno construction
rested. The northeast profile of the horno illustrates the two large stones and a
third smaller one (Figure 68). These footing stones undercut the horno by about 10
centimeters.
Lot 10 contained 14 bone fragments that weigh 86.6 grams. A 71.4 gram
sample of the plaster was taken from the northeast face of the cooking horno as a
part of this lot. Artifacts that were observed, but not collected, include 12 land
snails, two unidentifiable metal fragments, a large wire nail, brown and clear glass
fragments, and a piece of plastic.
Lot 11
Lot 11 of Suboperation A was the excavation of the rubble from the top of
the eastern half of the horno to reveal its inner construction and possibly evidence
of its use. The rubble was mounded on top of the horno, with the peak of the
mound about 40 centimeters from the top of the top course of stone. Matrix was
sandy with numerous small to meduim-sized yellow and brown sandstone rocks.
Construction was achieved using three large stones on each side (70 X 45 X 23
213

cm; 50 X 45 X 25 cm; and 40 X 40 X 25 cm on the southeast side), each with at
least one cut-face. Cornerstones have two cut faces. Chink stones were used to
level and stablize the courses. Excavations did not encounter the interior of the
oven itself. The structure was likely dismantled below the surface of the oven when
its stone was recycled.
Lot 11 contained one metal fragment—a piece of barbed wire that weighs
36.5 grams. One light green glass bottle rim fragment weighing 4.1 grams was also
recovered from this lot. Objects that were observed, but not collected, include
three land snails, three clear bottle glass shards, and two wire nails.

Operation 2, Suboperation A
Summary
The Suboperation A excavations revealed the construction techniques used
to build the outdoor cooking or baking horno. Three large building stones were
used to form each side of each course. The large stones were leveled and stabilized
using smaller “chink” stones. The area in the center of the construction was filled
in with smaller stones and sand. A layer of plaster likely covered the entire
construction, although the plaster was found preserved only at the base of the
bottom course.
Overall, the artifact density seems low and modern garbage was mixed in
with older artifacts. The low density can be partly explained by the clean fill used
by the builders. Also, the area around the horno was likely kept relatively clean
while it was in use. Later, after most of the building blocks were recycled, the
lower courses and tumbled stones became the base of an informal trash pile—a
convenient place to throw things out of the way. Bioturbation and rodents’
burrows contributed to the mixture of artifacts across time periods.
Operation 2, Suboperation A
Surface Collection Summary
The surface collection associated with Suboperation A was assembled
throughout the course of mapping, surveying, and excavating the area. Artifacts of
ceramic, lithic, metal, and glass were recovered. The quantity and weight totals for
each category are given in the following Table 129:

chain links, a hinge (11.6 g), a square nail, and a strap. The glass sample includes
two clear fragments from a rectangular panel bottle, a purple, and a white shard.
Operation 2, Suboperation B
Description
Suboperation B is the testing of an area inside the fence that did not appear
to be regularly graded, based on its slightly higher elevation. Suboperation B is a
1x1-m2 unit located about six meters west of the stone structure’s southwest
corner (Figure 69). Modern green and brown bottle glass were evident on the
surface around the excavation. The only artifacts associated with this suboperation

216

are some clear bottle glass fragments
from Lot 1. The unit was excavated in
four lots to 50 centimeters below
surface. No change in soil color was
detected.
Lots 1 through 4
FIGURE 69. Operation 2, Suboperation B was
located about six meters southwest of the
stone structure.

Lot 1 of Suboperation B was
the uppermost 10-centimeter layer of

matrix and it contained 13 glass fragments weighing 25.8 grams. All of these
fragments are clear bottle glass. Lot 2 of Suboperation B was a sterile 10centimeter layer beneath Lot 1.
Also sterile, Lot 3 was the 10-centimeter layer beneath Lot 2. The level of
the unit at the bottom of Lot 3 was about the same elevation as the rest of the
fenced (and graded) yard. Finally, Lot 4 was the 20-centimeter layer below Lot 3,
which contained no artifacts.
Operation 2, Suboperation B
Summary
The Suboperation B excavations did not reveal a great many artifacts. It is
possible that in the past the area around the house was kept clear of trash, or that
the grading activities over time have adversely affected the archaeological record
in this area. Further test excavations are necessary to locate activity areas
associated with the twentieth-century occupation.

217

Operation 2, Suboperation C
Description
Suboperation C was the testing of an area outside the fence, but within
about 20 meters of Suboperation 2A (Figure 70). Pedestrian survey in this area
revealed a partial horse or mule shoe, olive glass fragments, and square nails on
the surface around this unit. Suboperation C was a 1m2 unit, excavated to a depth
of 30 centimeters in three lots.
Lot 1
Lot 1 of Suboperation C contains one ceramic body sherd from a brown
glazed ceramic vessel that weighs 0.3 grams. Four metal artifacts, totaling 62.2
grams were recovered, including half of a horse or mule shoe with square nail
holes that weighs 53.5 grams (Figure 71). Also in this lot were four glass fragments weighing 5.4 grams. Six land snails were observed, but not collected.
Lot 2
Lot 2 of Suboperation C was the 10-centimeter layer of matrix below Lot
1. Lot 2 contains four bone fragments that weigh 23.3 grams. Two of these fragments appear to be the proximal end of a femur from a large mammal. Also recovered in this lot was one unidentifiable metal fragment weighing 8.6 grams. Five
fire-cracked rocks and three land snails were observed, but not collected.

Lot 3
Lot 3 of Suboperation C was the 10-centimeter layer of matrix below Lot
2. Four land snails were observed; otherwise Lot 3 was sterile.

removed as part of Operation 2 excavations. The percentage of glass by weight for
this suboperation, 69.68%, is the expected density; whereas, the percentage of
metal by weight for Suboperation A, at 41.73%, is below the expected amount.
The virtual sterility of Suboperation B, the lack of ceramics in any excavation except Suboperation C, and the concentration of metal artifacts associated
with Suboperation C, are all factors that contribute to more unequal ratios than
those observed for Operation 1.

Stone Structure
The details of the construction
of the stone structure at Rancho El
Saladito were recorded as part of this
project. The building was measured
with both a cloth and a metal meter
tape (Figure 74). Architectural renderings for each façade of the building and

a plan view are presented in the following drawings (Figures 75-83). For

comparison, photographs of each façade are also included (Figures 84-91).
As previously mentioned, the one-room structure was built about 1928 by
Francisco Hinojosa Barrera from Los Guerras. He was commissioned by the new
property owners, Adolfo and San Juana Hinojosa. According to oral history, a jacal
was located to the immediate north of the stone structure, where today there is a
covered cement patio (Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gomez de Guerra, personal
communication 2002).
The structure was built of native sandstone, recycled from the nearby
horno and quarried from about 500 meters to the northeast. Presumably the transportation of the stone was accomplished by draught animals and wheeled carts.
The stones were plastered inside and out with a lime plaster that was manufactured
nearby in a calera, or lime kiln (Doña María Berta Hinojosa Gomez de Guerra,
personal communication 2002). The method of construction typifies a local style

that has changed very little from colonial days, except in the degree of fortification
and the roofing techniques.
Sometime during the 1940s the original roof was replaced with a galvanized tin roof. The original roofing material is unknown. Bricks and cement blocks
were added to the top of the northeast wall of the building to change the pitch of
the roof, presumably when the tin was added. These additional materials are

evident only from the inside, as the exterior was plastered, although unplastered
bricks and blocks were visible from the outside when a corner of the tin roof
peeled up after a storm. The difference in height between the external northeast
wall and its opposite is most evident in the exterior northwest and southeast wall
profiles (Figures 76 and 78).
Internal Features
The main internal feature of the stone structure is its chimenea in the
northwest wall. The base of the hearth is a single stone measuring 2 X 1.5 X .15
meters. Shelves were built into the corners of the room to either side of the hearth

using similar flat stones, but triangular-shaped, and much smaller (0.6 X 0.5 X
0.05 meters). The lower shelf in the west corner is the only square one. One other
triangular shelf was built into the east corner.
There are two niches or recessed areas near the top of the interior of the
southwest wall, now used for storage. The wooden ceiling that covers the northern
half of the room forms a loft that is also used for storage. It was built by spanning
the width of the room with five beams. These beams were then covered by slat
boards running the opposite direction (Figures 88 and 89).
The door in the southeast wall is handmade, but does not appear to be the
original door because there are four hinge posts embedded in the doorframe near
each corner. The current door uses only two of the hinge posts. The doorway was
probably originally spanned by two narrower doors.
The doorway in the northeast wall of the structure uses three similar hinge
posts on one side to mount the handmade door. This may be the original door or it
may have been added later when the jacal that was either attached to or built along
side the stone building’s northeast wall was torn down (Doña María Berta
Hinojosa Gomez de Guerra, personal communication 2002). In its place was laid a
concrete patio that is also covered with a tin roof. The covered patio is L-shaped
and wraps around the northeast and southeast walls of the structure. While working around the house yard, I frequently ate my lunch under this canopy. There was
usually a dependable southerly breeze and a nice view. Traffic on the highway
could be spotted almost a kilometer away from the vantage point the porch offered. I imagine that when the road was still made of dirt, the dust cloud of approaching traffic would have been visible at an even greater distance.

Cultural Material Analysis
Ceramics
Ceramics make up the largest class of artifacts recovered from Rancho El
Saladito east of the arroyo as part of Operation 1 excavations and surface collections. The excavations produced 1,090 sherds weighing 2,950.1 grams, while the
surface collection contains 1,010 sherds weighing 5434.5 grams. In contrast, Operation 2 ceramic inventory is comparatively very small. The excavations on the west
side of the Arroyo El Saladito revealed only one glazed sherd weighing 0.3 grams.
The Operation 2 surface collection contains 40 sherds weighing 266.9 grams.
Ceramic artifacts were divided into the following broad categories for
analysis: Unglazed Wares including Mier Plain and burnished wares (Gilmore 1974,
Ivey and Fox 1999, Lakeman 2001, Perttula, et. al. 1999), Lead-Glazed Wares
including Galera, green glaze, and brown glaze wares (Barnes 1980, Gilmore 1974,
Perttula et. al. 1999, Schuetz 1969), Tin Glazed Wares or Mexican Majolicas (Clark
and Juarez 1986, Deagan 1987, Fox 2003, Gerald 1968, Goggin 1968, Ivey and Fox
1981, Lakeman 2001, Lister and Lister 1982, May 1975, Seifert 1977), Whitewares
or Englishware, and porcelain. Further analysis was attempted for two types of
wares—Majolicas and Englishware—as these are time sensitive and can assist in
dating the occupation of the sites. In the following discussion of the various types,
the collection as a whole is referenced. A distinction is made between ceramics from
excavations versus those from surface collections in Tables 136 and 137, which
compare the relative percentages by quantity and by weight. Table 138 provides the
same type of information for the Operation 2 surface collection. Rim profiles separated by ceramic type are illustrated in Figure 92.

Unglazed Wares
This category is comprised mainly of locally-produced Mier Plain, but also
includes burnished wares and a painted creamware (Figures 93 through 111).
There are 576 specimens of unglazed wares or 27.83% (32.35% by weight) of the
Operation 1 collection. Mier Plain is thought to represent locally made wares by
Hispanic and Tejano potters that was intended for local consumption (Perttula, et.
al. 1999:335). Very few sherds contained a carbon streak in the middle, suggesting
that these were fired in the open air while the majority were kiln fired. Mier Plain
sherds likely represent medium- to large-sized jars and bowls of local clay, tempered with sand or crushed rock. Crushed shell or bone may also have been used
as temper.
The 42 sherds of Red Pattern-Burnished Ware in the Operation 1 collection
represent the continuity between pre-Columbian ceramic traditions in the Valley of
Mexico and potters who continue to manufacture it today (Ivey and Fox 1999:37;
Lakeman 2001). This ware has been been coated with a fine-grained slip and is
highly polished on both internal and external surfaces (Gilmore 1974:63). The
designs are burnished, while the background has a matte finish (Figures 100
through 102).
Six sherds of a creamware that has been painted black and/or red are
included in this unglazed category (Figures 107 and 111).

Lead-Glazed Wares
The largest class of ceramic artifacts in the Operation 1 collection is Leadglazed ware, which includes Galera ware, at 871 sherds weighing 3,801.6 grams,
or 42.08% of the total. Anne Fox conducted the first detailed analysis of lead
glazed wares in Texas (Gilmore 1974:55-59). Studying the collection from Mission
Rosario, near Goliad, Fox determined the category could be divided into sandy
paste and fine paste types (Gilmore 1974:55-59). Sandy paste wares, with yellow
or yellow and green glazes, are usually wheel-thrown with thick walls (Schuetz
1969:53). Fine paste types include Galera ware, various brown-glazed wares,
Tonalá, and Black Luster glaze ware (Figures 112 through 140).
Of the 871 lead-glazed sherds, 227 (or 26 %) are Galera ware. Carbon
streaks were not evident, which is characteristic of a well-fired and oxidized ware.
Common forms are chocolateras and bean pots with cream-colored and black
paints. Glazes include clear, yellow, and brown. Galera Polychrome is known from
after 1750, when ceramic forms replace copper chocolateras (Barnes 1980,
Perttula et. al. 1999). This ceramic tradition, like Red Patterned-Burnished ware,
continues to the present.

Tin Glazed Wares
The tin glazed wares in the Operation 1 collection are all Mexican Majolicas (Figures 141 through 180). Most of them are probably of Central Mexican
origin, having been manufactured in Mexico City, Puebla or Guanajuato (Deagan
1987, Goggin 1968, Lister and Lister 1982). Majolicas are wheel-thrown vessels
that have a distinctive opaque surface made possible by adding tin to the lead glaze
that covered both the vessel’s interior and exterior. Majolicas are twice-fired in a
kiln; the first firing sets the glaze and the second firing follows any painted decorations that are added (Fox 2003). General vessel forms include platos or brimmed
plates, two types of cups, tazas and pocillos, jarras or pitchers, and escudillas or
bowls (Lakeman 2001).
Florence and Robert Lister (1982) divided Mexican Majolicas into fine
grade and common grade, based on the color of the paste, the color and thickness
of the glaze and the color palette chosen for the painted decorations. Fine grade
Mexican Majolicas were manufactured from a red clay, whereas the common grade
used a pinkish tan paste. The lighter colored paste of the common grade made it
possible to use a thinner glaze. While both types were decorated with blue paint,
green was only used to decorate the common grade (Lister and Lister 1982).
In Puebla the Majolica industry mixed locally-available red and white clays
for a cream or peach paste (Deagan 1987:78). Majolica manufacturing began in
Puebla during the seventeen century and continues to the present. The “Puebla
tradition,” is a name given to a long series of blue and white wares from the
seventeeth and eighteenth centuries (May 1975:34, 43). The series includes several
types evident in the Operation 1 collection, including Huejotzingo Blue on White,
249

Puebla Blue on White, and San Elizario Polychrome. By the mid-eighteenth century, Puebla potters began to shift away from the blue-and-white styles to a predominately green and orange polychrome, which became known as the “Aranama
tradition” (Deagan 1987:79).
May (1975:47) dates the Aranama tradition to between 1780 and 1850,
with a transition period from the Puebla to Aranama traditions falling between
1790 and 1800. Green varieties, polychrome mixes, and unstandardized forms
occur during this transition period (1975:70). Several examples of the Aranama
tradition are found in the Operation 1 collection, including orange-banded,
Monterey and San Diego polychromes (Figures 141, 146, 148, 149, 151, 153, 155,
156, 159 and 160).
Majolica manufacturing ceased in Mexico City after 1750, however, the
industry in Puebla continued production and new centers developed, including in
Guanajuato (Deagan 1987:87). Several examples of Guanajuato polychrome are in
the Operation 1 collection (Figures 153 through 155).
The following descriptions are arranged in roughly chronological order and
include the types of Majolica present in this collection.
Huejotzingo Blue on White (1700-1850)
A single narrow blue rim band and the absence of any other decoration is
characteristic of Huejotzingo Blue on White (Deagan 1987:83, Goggin 1968:195196). A later version of this type (ca. 1775 to 1825) has a wavy rim band, which can
vary from blue to green or yellow (Seifert 1977:71 as cited in Fox 2003).
Puebla Blue on White (1700-1850)
This type is the most common and widespread eighteenth-century Majolica
250

encountered at Spanish colonial sites (Deagan 1987: 83-85, Goggin 1968:190195). As such it is also one of the most well-studied. Typical examples have precise
designs, composed mainly of lobes and dots, that cover most of the vessel surface
(Deagan 1987:84). Common motifs include floral, human, and animal designs.
After 1750, several variants are manufactured, including Puebla Green on White
and the Wavy Rim band variant (Deagan 1987:85).
San Elizario Polychrome (1750-1850)
This type resembles Puebla Blue on White in many respects, with the
addition of brown or black to outline the blue designs. Rims have a wide band,
edged in black, with blue pendants suspended from it. These pendants may be
highlighted with black accents (Deagan 1987:86, Gerald 1968:45). A long-legged
shore bird motif is a common design in the center of platos.
San Diego Polychrome (1770 to 1800)
This type is defined based on Mark Barnes and Ronald May’s excavations
from sites active during the first half of the nineteenth century in California and
Arizona (1972). Below the vessel’s orange rim band are yellow, green, and brown
balls outlined in black. The balls seem to be suspended from groups of black stems
(Fox 2003). San Diego Polychrome appears in the 1770s at Rancho de Las Cabras
near Floresville, Texas (Ivey and Fox 1981:35).
Monterey Polychrome (1800 to 1830)
This is another Aranama Polychrome variant that studies in California have
separated out into its own category (Barnes and May 1979:36; Fox 2003). Anne
Fox suggests an earlier date in Texas for this type, perhaps in the late 1700s (Fox
2003), based on its presence at Mission Espiritu Santo and Presidio La Bahia,
251

which moved to Goliad in 1749. Monterey Polychrome has an orange rim band
with a large yellow oval and black diagonal slashes below the rim band (Fox
2003). To either side of the yellow ovals, orange spirals alternate with green fronds
(Fox 2003). The Monterey Polychrome examples from this collection are quite
small, but the characteristic green fronds are evident below the rim band.
Guanajuato Polychrome (early 1800s)
This ware has a dark terra cotta paste and the background enamel has a
greenish cast (Lister and Lister 1974; Fox 2003) Decorations in the form of geometric designs, dot patterns and wavy lines are executed in rust, green, yellow, and
black-brown (Fox 2003). These wares are known from all Spanish colonial sites in
the San Antonio River Valley (Fox 2003), early nineteenth-century sites in Laredo
(Clark and Juarez 1986), and at Mission Refugio (Fox 2003).

Whitewares
The presence of this type of ceramic indicates a period of occupation
dating to after the first quarter of the nineteenth century. The opening of the
international port of Matamoros in 1824 facilitated the importation of new English
wares and broadened the ceramic trade of the region (Alonzo 1998:67-73;
Perttula, et. al. 1999:332).
Imported English wares, by virtue of mass production techniques, became
cheaper for northern frontier residents to buy than ceramics from Central Mexico
(Anne Fox personal communication 2002). The widespread availability of European wares had a significant impact on the Mexican Majolica manufacturing in
Puebla, where the number of production centers declined from 46 in 1773 to 16 in
1802 (Gerald 1968:54). In fact, between 1844 and 1856 a factory existed in Puebla
for the production of English-style transfer ware.
Examples of English whiteware in the Operation 1 collection include
varieties with handpainted designs, transferware, ironstone, and banded slipware
(Figures 181 through 204).
Most of the examples from the Operation 1 collection come from the
surface collection associated with Suboperation C, although a few were recovered
in excavations at Suboperations C, E, and G. The surface collections associated
with Suboperations D, E, F, G, and H, all contained examples of whiteware.
Significantly, no whiteware is among the collection recovered from Suboperations
A and B.

263

English whiteware is the largest class of ceramic artifact recovered in
Operation 2 surface collections (Figures 205 through 209).
Porcelain
No porcelain was recovered from any excavation; however, four sherds of
porcelain were gathered as part of Operation 1, Suboperation C surface collection
(Figure 210). There are 13 artifacts of porcelain recovered from Operation 2
surface collection, including a doll arm (Figure 211) that would have been wired to
the doll’s shoulder (Anne Fox personal communication 2003).

Tertiary flakes, at 100 pieces, are the most numerous of the lithic artifacts,
weighing 257.2 grams. When considered together with primary and secondary
flakes and shatter, there are 186 artifacts weighing 721.9 grams which represent
evidence of lithic tool manufacturing and retouching. These numbers are 87% of
the quantity, or 42% of the weight of all lithic artifacts recovered.
A wide variety of formal and expedient tools are included in this collection,
including: 10 projectile points, preforms, or fragments; six bifaces, preforms, or
fragments; five scrapers; three utilized flakes; two expedient tools; a blade; and a
core.
271

Operation 2
Five lithic artifacts weighing 167.7 grams were recovered through Operation 2 surface collections. Specifically, a projectile point (Figure 228), a projectile
point fragment (Figure 229), and a primary flake are associated with Suboperation
2A, while two flakes are associated with the bluffs north of the quarry.

Vertebrate Faunal Remains
Operation 1
A total of 401 bone artifacts weighing 768.5 grams were recovered
through Operation 1 excavations and associated surface collections (larger examples are in Figures 230 through 238). This total includes a human molar that
appeared previously (Figure 59 on page 196). A total of 31 bone artifacts weighing
163.4 grams were recovered through Operation 2 excavations (two examples are
in Figure 239).
Many of the 432 bone artifacts are small, not well-preserved fragments that
do not lend themselves to easy identification. A few are larger, like those pictured
on the following pages, and offer clues to the inhabitants’ diet. Photographic
documentation was accomplished in the field with the hopes of later identifying
some of the species represented in the collection. However, the difficulty in analyzing bones solely from photos allows only rudimentary identification.
Based on census data from 1817, we know that at Rancho San Lorenzo de
las Minas, the likely precursor to Rancho El Saladito, a variety of animals were
raised including sheep, goats, horses, cattle, and mules. These species are likely
represented in this collection. Hopefully, future funding will allow a more thorough
analysis of the faunal bone collection from Rancho El Saladito.

Shell
A total of 361 land snails (Rabdotus) weighing 365.5 grams and 162
aquatic shell fragments weighing 166.2 grams were recorded for Operation 1
excavations. An additional 16 aquatic shell fragments weighing 125.3 grams were
recovered from associated surface collections, including the utilized half shell in
Figure 55 on page 177.
On the other side of the arroyo, no shell artifacts were recovered in either
excavations or surface collections of Operation 2.
The land snails were not archived, but their quantities and weight was
recorded for future reference and/or analysis. Most of the aquatic shell fragments
were small, weighing one gram or less. Ethnographic data suggest that aquatic
shell was used along with fossilized oyster shell to produce cal, or lime, used for
plastering and cooking (Berta Hinojosa de Guerra, personal communication 2002;
Graham 1988).
It is likely that both prehistoric and colonial inhabitants of the area made
use of the local shellfish food resources and recycled the shell itself, either through
direct use or by processing it into cal. Although lime production is associated with
other Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Maya and Aztec, it is not a documented
practice among the hunting and gathering Coahuiltecan groups that occupied the
lower Rio Grande valley during prehistoric times.

283

Metal
Thirty-eight metal artifacts weighing 231.3 grams are recorded for the
Operation 1 excavations and associated surface collections. Several of these
artifacts are featured on previous pages, including a utensil handle (Figure 25 on
page 142), two higas and a ruido (Figure 26 on page 144), chain links and/or
hooks (Figure 54 on page 177), an embossed medallion (Figure 52 on page 176), a
cross pendant (Figure 53 on page 176), a thimble (Figure 60 on page 199), a hinge
(Figure 61 on page 201), a fragment of a scissor handle (Figure 62 on page 203)
and a modified iron bar that may have been used as a quarrying chisel (Figure 72
on page 220).
The majority of metal artifacts comes from the surface collections associated with Operation 2 and the west side of Arroyo El Saladito. A total of 57 metal
artifacts weighing over 2,145 grams were recovered from Suboperations 2A and
2C. Of these only seven artifacts weighing 121.5 grams were recovered in the
excavations. Farrier’s cut offs (Figures 242 and 255) indicate blacksmithing activities, while harness buckles (Figures 242, 250, and 258) and horseshoe fragments
(Figure 71 on page 219 and Figure 253) bear witness to horse- and/or mule-raising
activities. Two metal artifacts may be pieces of trunk hardware (Figures 241 and
246), while another is the trigger slot of a gun (Figure 245). Inside the stone house
were a pair of shears for sheep wool (Figure 262).
In the yard around the stone house were numerous implements used for
agriculture and other related activities. These iron tools are stored beneath various
trees in the yard. Figures 263 through 287 illustrate these artifacts, which were
only recorded and not collected.

Glass
A total of 44 glass shards weighing 233.8 grams were recorded for Operation 1 excavations and associated surface collections. Of these only six shards
weighing 6.3 grams came from the excavations. Photographs of three glass artifacts from this collection are on previous pages, including a green glass bottle
stopper from 1-C-1 (Figure 56 on page 178) and two olive glass fragments (Figure
58 on page 185) from the surface collection associated with Suboperation 1C.

Interpretations and Conclusions
A wide variety of activities are represented in the archaeological record at
Rancho El Saladito. The ceramic artifacts provide testament to the extensive trade
relationships that stretched at first to Spain through central and coastal Mexico and
later to England through Matamoros. The prevalence of early Majolica types
(Huejotzingo Blue on White, Puebla Blue on White, and San Elizario Polychrome)
in the northeastern corner of the study area (Operation 1, Suboperations A and B)
to the exclusion of English whitewares, indicates that this was the earliest area of
occupation, dating from the 1750s. Alternatively, English whitewares and later
Majolica types (San Diego, Monterey, and Guanajuato polychromes) are the
predominate types in Operation 1, Suboperation C, which is located about 150
meters to the southwest of Suboperations A and B.
Thus, at Rancho El Saladito there are at least two temporally distinct
occupations on the east side of the arroyo. Based on the ethnohistorical record,
Suboperations A and B may represent the first settlement at what was then known
as El Rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas. This location would have been strategically close to the Río Grande for access to fresh water. As the extended family
grew through births and marriages, more jacales were built to the south and
southwest along the pennisula that is formed by the intersection of the Arroyo El
Saladito and the Río Grande until the settlement area reached an approximate size
of 20,000 m2. This project did not survey the entire limits of the original porción,
so it is not possible to state with certainty as to how the inhabitants managed their
herds or where they raised crops. The animal herds may have been kept close to

301

the human occupation at first, but as the population of both grew, alternate strategies would have likely developed. Their smaller, tamer herds of mixed animals
might have been successfully tended by herders on foot, but larger and perhaps
feral herds of cattle would have required the use of horse-mounted vaqueros.
The northern frontier of New Spain is generally thought to have been an
isolated place where vast lands were occupied by relatively few people. Therefore
it is not surprising that despite access to extensive trade networks, evidence of the
colonists’ self-sufficiency is also found in the archaeological record. For example, a
large porcion of the ceramic collection is locally-made utilitarian wares that appear
to be used consistently throughout the occupation. The scissor handle and the
thimble from Operation 1 support ethnographic evidence that women made most,
if not all, of the family’s clothes and blankets. While cloth may have been purchased for clothing, sheep’s wool was used to make quilts and bedding. The size of
the thimble suggests it was used by either a petite adult, or possibly by a child.
Other metal objects from Operation 1, like the engraved utensil handle and
the higas or ruidos suggest locally-made products. The token with the name
“Baring Lxon” embossed on it may represent a form of local currency. The
farrier’s cast-offs from Operation 2 are by-products of blacksmithing, while horse
or mule raising is indicated by the number of buckles and shoe fragments recovered. Also at Operation 2 the numerous well-worn iron implements reveal the
extent of the twentieth-century agricultural efforts.
While most artifacts have a utilitarian purpose, some objects, like the glass
bottle stopper and olive glass fragments from bottles that probably contained wine

302

represents both access to trade relationships and possession of a disposable income. Other objects like the cross pendant or milagro tell us something about the
owner’s spiritual beliefs.

303

Chapter 8: Summary
There are some very tangible threads that run through Mier’s history and into
today’s reality. One is that settlement has been located at this easy ford of the Río
Alamo, (which was along the salt trail and three fords of the Río Grande), since at least
1734, when it was known as El Paso del Cántero. The ford has been and remains a
passageway. The indigenous people of the area were known for trading salt and for
using the trail across the Río Alamo. The Nuevo Santander colonists learned from the
indigenous groups and sent traders to exploit the deposit with mule-driven carts. Illicit
trade with Louisiana began early in the history of Mier and surrounding communities as
their distance to Central Mexico prevented enforcement of the casta restriction of
international trade to peninsulares. The North American Free Trade Agreement of 1995
opened the U.S. border for trade with Mexico in an unprecedented way, however,
illegal smuggling continues.
This dissertation presents archaeological excavations and historical analyses of
ranches and towns associated with the Lower Río Grande Valley to better understand
the nature and articulation of the ranch and town settlements, the types of household
production and livestock raising that sustained them, their trade relationships as reflected
in their material culture, and the complex issues of ethnic and social identity construction
along a contested border through time. My primary goal has been to shed new light on a
process of colonization and adaptation to a border context that went on a century
before the more-studied Anglo-American colonization of the region.
This dissertation places Mier in a broader context by revealing the material
culture that illuminates the colonists’ daily practices. The context needed to interpret
these activities is achieved by incorporating evidence from archival documents, oral
304

histories, and genealogical data. In this manner, archaeology can help access identity
construction along the border and examine how these identities were manipulated and
evolve through time. A consideration of the colonists’ mining community origins and a
cultural summary of the indigenous groups they likely encountered when they arrived at
the Río Grande also contribute to building a broader context within which to interpret
the artifacts. The material culture from Rancho El Saladito is then compared, for
contextual reasons, to that of previous archaeological investigations in the area.
Town and Rancho Settlements
Between 1748 and 1755, the civilian colonists of Nuevo Santander established
23 communities, including six along the banks of the Río Grande. This dissertation
focuses on one of these, Mier Tamaulipas, and the pobladores who received porciones
and established livestock ranches on both banks of the Río Grande. These colonists and
their descendents, like the indigenous populations before them, literally lived con un pie
en cada lado, with a foot on each side of river. These ranches were some the first of
their kind in Texas and represent a unique and enduring form of civilian colonization
based on the relocation of entire families, and without major emphases on missions and
presidios.
The excavations at Rancho El Saladito reveal a mid-eighteenth century
settlement on the east side of the arroyo that grew and spread along the landscape until
at least 1824 and perhaps until 1928. The archeological investigations also reveal a
twentieth-century settlement on the opposite side of the arroyo where draught animals
were relied on for agriculture, a wide variety of livestock was raised, cloth was woven
from wool, and iron working was practiced. The rancho inhabitants were largely selfsufficient; however, they also relied on trade relationships to supply them with the things
305

they could not produce, like sugar, coffee, wine, and tin-glazed (and later whiteware)
ceramic vessels.
Historical sources and oral history offer conflicting information about the exact
nature of settlement in Nuevo Santander. Where did the population concentrate? Were
they located within the boundaries of the town central as mandated by official decree?
Or on rancho settlements as demanded the necessities of their livestock? Class or
wealth also plays a role in the rural vs. urban settlement pattern of Spanish colonial
society. The more affluent families were able to hire workers to run the rancho, while the
family resided in town with the advantages of increased security and more social
activities like school and church (Gonzalez 1998).
Requirements for land tenure included the provisions that settlers must reside on
the land, protect it from Indian attack, and construct homes (preferably of stone).
Individual porciones were not assigned in Mier or elsewhere in the colony until 1767,
some fourteen years after the initial colonists arrived, however, we know from the
historical record that nineteen families already lived on one or more ranchos in the
vicinity of Mier in 1749 and probably as early as 1734. These people would already
have established ranchos by the time that settlement at Mier was made official in 1753.
Furthermore, settlers who arrived in 1753 with livestock would have immediately
required sufficient pastures.
Archaeology is uniquely positioned to answer these questions about the nature
of early colonial settlement. Excavations at a wide-range of ranchos, a comprehensive
rural regional settlement survey, an assessment of the construction dates of extent
historical structures in central Mier, and further research of archival material, are all
viable approaches to these research questions.
306

Although the scope of this dissertation is not on such a regional level, archival
information encountered during this course of research documents the prevalence of
jacales versus stone structures among the rancho settlement of Mier after 1765
(Chapter 1, Table 3). The jacal type of house form does not fit into a framework
developed for the rancho settlements known from Zapata County, Texas. It is
postulated here that stone buildings were built by wealthier people, those with a
convenient quarry, or those settlers who were at a relatively higher risk of attack by
Indian groups and who thus required a fireproof type of housing. Jacales might have
only been used as a temporary shelter for members of the upper class during the
construction of a stone house, but for most of the population they were permanent
residences and represent a construction style that endures to the present. The remains of
jacales are difficult, if not impossible, to locate archaeologically, but their importance to
the survival of the Nuevo Santander pobladores should not be forgotten. On the 38
ranches listed in Table 3, jacales outnumber stone structures by a ratio of 37 to 1. There
were 296 jacales and only 8 stone houses.
Household Organization and Production
The morphology and functions of Spanish colonial rancho settlements are made evident
when the analysis is focused at the household level. This type of analysis also helps to
concentrate on the daily lives and activities of ordinary people. For this dissertation,
individuals and their relationships to the household are considered through a multi-scalar
approach that combines genealogical and archival data to reconstruct the individuals and
their livestock that populated these ranchos. Such information is crucial to developing
excavation strategies and interpreting the material culture of the ranchos.

307

From this dissertation emerges a refined definition for households in a ranching
community. This definition is based on the examination of census data from about 1817
for people and livestock at three ranchos: El Rancho San Pedro de las Flores, El
Rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas, and El Rancho Santo Tomas de Sabinitas.
Genealogies for each rancho family were created using baptism, marriage, and death
records from Mier, Camargo, and Cerralvo. These genealogies were then used to
analyze the census data and to determine how each resident of the rancho was related
to one another.
Rancho households are comprised of members of an extended kin network
residing in multiple structures arranged strategically along the landscape. Their land
would have belonged jointly to the kin network or lineage, while each unit of the
network would have exerted control over their respective livestock and pastures. The
overall economic strategy would have favored the rancho as a whole above individual
kin units. Thus, Nuevo Santander ranchos were characterized by a high degree of
mutual cooperation and organization based primarily on kin relationships, although there
was room for fictive kin and laborers on the ranchos.
The census data from about 1817 for Mier ranchos reveal a settlement pattern
of multiple, closely related households residing together on one rancho. Livestock is
concentrated in the hands of a few male members, although not always in the eldest
males of the lineage. Male in-laws will often bring significant livestock holdings to the
rancho. Distinct animal husbandry strategies are evident in the census, with some
ranchers choosing to raise more sheep and goats than cattle or horses. Others raise
cows and horses to the exclusion of sheep and goats. An extensive settlement survey is
necessary to determine if households with larger herds or different kinds of livestock
308

might live further apart from each other depending on pasture requirements. It may be
that for mutual protection the rancho community erected their dwellings in close
proximity and managed their herds in other ways, perhaps by using mobile teams of
horse-mounted vaqueros who worked great distances from their primary dwellings.
In Chapter 6 an in-depth study of San Lorenzo de las Minas, the likely
precursor to Rancho El Saladito, reveals a steady rate of growth over a span of 35
years, based on archival and genealogical research. The rancho population increased
from 15 people in two families in 1782 to 63 people in 11 families by 1817. Marriages
and the subsequent incorporation of in-laws’ property to the rancho contributed greatly
to its economic success. The distribution of livestock indicates apparent specialization
by certain families in breeding or training certain animals to the exclusion of others. Such
specialization would have influenced the spatial arrangement of settlements across the
landscape. This information, taken in consideration with the ethnohistorical data,
influenced the placement of the excavations as much as did the location of artifacts on
the surface.
Trade Relationships of Nuevo Santander Colonists
Earliest trade relationships for procuring ceramics were with Puebla and later
Guanajuato, both in Central Mexico. The failure of early irrigation projects forced the
Nuevo Santander communities along the Rio Grande to trade hides, tallow, and wool
with the haciendas and mining communities of Nuevo Leon for corn, beans, and other
staples. The consumption of wine is suggested by the presence of olive glass shards.
Early trade in livestock that could be driven in herds also developed with Nacogdoches
and Louisiana. Matamoros opens its port to international trade after 1824 and through

309

this conduit the Rio Grande communities receive Englishware ceramics and other
merchandise.
Thus, although they were isolated on the frontier, these pobladores were also
connected by elaborate trade relationships that they manipulated for their survival. They
adapted to life on the border by being both flexible and conservative. They learned
about the land and its resources from the indigenous groups they encountered and/or
incorporated into Nuevo Santander society. They adapted the animal husbandry
methods passed to them by their Spanish ancestors and became very successful along
the Rio Grande, an area that proved particularly well-suited for open-range livestock
raising. They were innovative and combined a version of the indigenous housing with
wattle and daub and lime plaster and created the jacal, a frontier building that may not
have been fireproof, but it remains an enduring architectural form in the region.
Ethnic and Social Identity Among Nuevo Santander Colonists
Census data examined in this dissertation were neither consistently recorded nor
readily accessible. It comes from a variety of primary and secondary sources and
suffers by being incomplete. However, it is possible to say something about the
ethnicities by which the pobladores identified. Many colonists on the earliest census for
Mier (1753) are listed as “españoles,” while a few are mestizo. Records analyzed by
Maria Luisa Herrera Casasús (1998:59-60) show that of 388 baptismals between
1767-1789 in Mier, 113 or 29% were Afromestizos, while 224 or 58% were
españoles. The Mier Census of 1788 reveals 402 individuals or 42% of the total
populations were African or Afromestizos (Herrera Casasús 1998:70).
Clearly indigenous, African, and mestizo individuals were among the earliest
settlers of Mier, despite the local contemporary historicized myths to the contrary. A
310

frontier such as the Rio Grande communities of Nuevo Santander likely provided
members of casta groups an opportunity to move from a life as a wage laborer in a mine
or hacienda to a life as a property owner and livestock raiser. The dangers of the
frontier were offset by the opportunities for social advancement that it offered. On the
frontier people could improve their social caste, at least on paper, by acting the part.
Apparently, mestizos and mulattos who owned land and property, who dressed like
españoles, spoke Spanish, and practiced Catholicism were either themselves regarded
as Spanish in official records or their children became españoles when baptized.
Although census data from 1779 (Chapter 4, Table 8) reinforce the information
about casta designations gleaned from the 1753 census, these data also raise some
interesting questions when considered contextually. Specifically, I am referring to casta
designations as registered in the 1788 Census for Mier (Chapter 3, Table 6), just nine
years later. The figures do not lend themselves to easy comparison because some of the
casta categories are lumped together, but apparently, within nine years Black and
afromestizo categories grow from zero to 42% of the population. Clearly, this segment
of Mier’s population that was not apparently represented in earlier years of the colony,
experiences a growth spurt during this time. The reasons for this remain unclear but may
be related to the relocation of Nacogdoches and the shortage of land associated with
San Antonio (Martha Menchaca, personal communication 2003). It is also significant
that total population actually decreased by 15, thus, they must be replacing the earlier
population. In other words, españoles, Indian, and indomestizos went from being 100%
of the population to constituting only 58% of it in nine years.
The historical record is silent at this point until the next available census with
casta information in 1853. By then Mier’s population is recorded as 5,082 with no
311

Blacks or afromestizos. The questions remain: Where did the Black and afromestizo
population come from, settle, and either go, or else, how were they integrated into the
society? How are these changes in population reflected in the material record? These
are all valid avenues of inquiry for historical archaeologists and involve issues that must
be approached from more directions that just the archives.
Thus, we catch a glimpse of an emerging Black population on the frontier that is
somehow integrated into the mestizo or español categories to the point of disappearing
in about a century’s time. The exact mechanism of this transformation remains unclear
until census data including casta designations for 1788-1853 are located. However,
some general conclusions can be drawn from the proliferation of casta categories during
the eighteenth century. Intermarriage among people of different casta categories meant
that terms had to be created to describe their children. Also during the eighteenth
century, the practice of importing slaves from Africa or from slave traders in the Antilles
into New Spain had just about been abandoned because the mulatto population offered
a ready supply of cheap manual labor (Herrera Casasús 1998:5-6). “The division of
castas, through mestizaje, or racial mixing, was erasing the visible barrier of skin color
and somatic characteristics, therefore diminishing segregation somewhat” (Herrera
Casasús 1998:5-6 (author’s translation)).
Blacks likely intermarried with españoles, Indians, and mestizos to the point
where in dress and appearance (skin color, hair texture, language, etc.) their
descendants became classified as mestizo or español. The low population density of
Nuevo Santander favored the rapid mestizaje of the population and opened the way for
the resultant mestizos to ascend the social scale (Herrera Casasús 1998:46). After all,
on the frontier privileges usually reserved for peninsulares or criollos, like owning
312

property, carrying a weapon, and riding a horse, became available to the pobladores in
exchange for their population and defense of the frontier, regardless of their race or
ethnic backgrounds. Gonzalo Aguirre Beltran (1972:273) cites the text of an eighteenthcentury ordinance, which found it necessary to explain that in the towns of Nuevo
Santander the population was not all Indian. The ordinance noted lighter skin color as
well as the manner of dress and the use of the Spanish language as factors that
distinguished some Indians as españoles (León 1924:27 as cited in Aguirre Beltran
1972:273).
Thus, if and when census data can be located in their primary form and racial
designations can be extracted, how reliable will these designations be? The best way
would be to locate several sets of census data that span the first century of the colony’s
existence and trace individuals whose racial designations change through time. Another
avenue would be to examine not just census data, but the primary baptismal, death, and
marriage records. The handwritten entries contain more information regarding caste than
do the secondary versions reproduced from the Mormon library. If these records could
be systematically gleaned for at least the 20-30 earliest families associated with Mier,
then perhaps a better understanding of the complexities of ethnic and social identities
would emerge. Undoubtedly, the ethnic identities of the colonists were constructed and
manipulated by those who wore them. They functioned in different ways according to
the social context. For the Nuevo Santander colonists, ethnic identification and affiliation
would have been wielded like dynamic social forces, helping them negotiate their liminal
space on the frontier.

313

Continuities and Variations Between Cerralvo and Mier
The most significant continuity between the two communities was that of the
human population. Settlers from Cerralvo constituted two-thirds of Mier’s initial
population. People of color and those of mixed-race, above all, would have been
attracted to the freedom and opportunities available in both communities, but more so in
Mier because of the landgrants. As emphasized in the previous section, on the frontier
people could, with relative ease, improve their social castes, at least on paper, by acting
the part. The lack of comprehensive census data for the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries makes it difficult to quantify the casta population, however, their presence must
not be ignored.
Herein lies a dilemma that future research must consider: when scholars locate
the necessary demographic information, how reliable can the racial designations be? I
suspect census data for the frontier in general would reveal an exaggerated number of
españoles and an undercount of people of color. We know that both localities were
initially surrounded with significant indigenous populations that were eventually
decimated by abuse and conflict or incorporated by acculturation into español society.
We also know, at least in Mier, but likely in Cerralvo as well, that Blacks, mulattos, and
afromestizos formed a substantial part of the population. What continue to elude us are
the exact population figures or proportions and the processes of integration,
acculturation, and/or assimilation.
Other important continuities apparent between the two communities include the
agricultural and ranching traditions. The inhabitants of Cerralvo developed agriculture
and ranching to support the mining industry, so that colonial settlers in Mier would likely
have been familiar with, if not proficient at, both classes of activities. Therefore, they
314

would have been attracted by the availability of land and pasture in Mier. The cattle
brought to Mier were probably descendents of the herd that Carvajal brought to
Cerralvo in the 1580s along with a horse-mounted vaquero style of herd management.
Other continuities derive from the exploitation of stone resources. Material for
construction of many of Mier’s homes and buildings was quarried from a hill about 1.5
km from the plaza. The settlers’ familiarity with the hills of Cerralvo, especially El Cerro
del Topo, no doubt aided in their exploitation of the mineral resources around Mier.
The two most salient differences to consider in a discussion of the settlement
patterns of Mier in relation to Cerralvo, are the vastly different landscapes and, as a
consequence, the varied natural resources available to their inhabitants. As an industry
dependent on accessible natural mineral resources, mining had an impact on Cerralvo’s
economy that has no corollary in Mier’s history. Mier, on the other hand, was wellsuited for large-scale ranching, which involved cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and mules.
The riverine setting and the alluvial soils provided fertile agricultural lands in Mier,
although the area was subject to seasonal flooding. The Río Grande also provided Mier
a transportation route not available to inland Cerralvo.
Rancho El Saladito in the context of previous archaeological research in the
area
The archaeological evidence produced by this research project at Rancho El
Saladito must be considered in the context of previous research. In all of the examples
of previous archaeological cited in this chapter, stone foundations or buildings were
documented. However, at Rancho El Saladito in the area of earliest occupation (east of
the Arroyo Saladito) no stone structures were located. On the west side of the arroyo is

315

a stone structure built in 1928 and the remains of an earlier outdoor horno, which
according to oral history was associated with a jacal.
Evidence is presented in Chapter 6 that indicates the precursor of Rancho El
Saladito was El Rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas, which was founded by the recipient
of Mier Porción 6, Ramón Guerra. Although this ranch is not named in the survey of
house types (Chapter 1, Table 3), it is likely that Los Guerras (with 11 jacales)
describes the same ranch, considering its location between Las Flores (Mier Porción 7)
and Sabinitas (Mier Porción 5). Los Guerras also is listed near La Ysla de los
Hinojosas, which is across the Río Grande from Rancho El Saladito.
Given the low occurrence overall of stone buildings, it is not surprising that
eighteenth- or nineteenth-century examples were not encountered at Rancho El
Saladito. This is despite the existence of a convenient quarry, and the occurrence of
stone buildings at 41ZP39, 41ZP43, Cabaseño, and Los Corralitos. One possible
explanation is that sites on the north bank of the Río Grande were more prone to Indian
attacks and thus needed the protection afforded by stone.
Ceramic artifacts at Rancho El Saladito, unlike architecture, are very similar to
those from 41ZP39, 41ZP43, and Cabaseño. Majolica types are identical, as are Mier
Plainwares forms. Later Englishwares also bear uncanny resemblances and may indicate
either similar aesthetic tastes among consumers or the prevalence of certain decorative
types in the marketplace.
Ceramics from mission contexts in other parts of Texas, although not
summarized in this dissertation, can also be compared to the collection from Rancho El
Saladito with informative conclusions. Ceramics from Texas mission contexts were
studied in a type collection at the Center for Archeological Research at the University of
316

Texas at San Antonio. Basic differences between the two collections include the lack of
French faience or Chinese porcelain in the Rancho El Saladito collection. Less
expensive majolica types such as Huejotzingo Blue on White and Puebla Green on
White are more common in the ranch context.
Thus, although it is helpful to study the broad context into which Rancho El
Saladito fits, in the areas of architecture and ceramic artifacts El Saladito stands apart
from its neighbors to the north on ranches and at missions, respectively. There are likely
multiple reasons for these differences, not the least of which is the state of relations with
the indigenous people that Mier colonists encountered. Again, a body of research on a
more regional level would be necessary to address the reasons for some of these
differences.
Indigenous populations likely encountered by Nuevo Santander colonists
The Nuevo Santander colonists did not enter an empty landscape, instead they
encountered numerous Indian groups associated with Mier and surrounding
communities. They were met by various indigenous groups who, although they may have
shared certain cultural traits, also maintained their own unique identities. Undoubtedly,
some members of these groups contributed their labor, knowledge, and skills to help the
colony succeed. These contributions are evident today in architecture and in the
nutritional and medicinal use of native plants.
Our information about Indian groups comes from colonial government and
mission reports and is biased according to the goals of the observers. Clearly a number
of various indigenous groups populated the frontier along the Río Grande at the time of
the arrival of the pobladores and continued to co-exist at least through the first quarter
of the nineteenth century. Large numbers of indigenous people undoubtedly died from
317

disease or physical violence with the colonists. However, through the social mechanisms
of marriage, adoption, and religious conversion at least some indigenous people were
incorporated or assimilated themselves into colonial society. They also contributed their
knowledge, physical labor and creative energies on the ranches and toward the
construction of Mier’s church on the main plaza. Certain carved elements such as the
floral motifs in the stone around the church’s entrance suggest an artist of indigenous
descent (Arq. Carlos Rugerio, personal communication 1998). Although specific
contributions by indigenous individuals may be difficult to pinpoint because of a lack of
documentation, Chapter 2 demonstrates that even though some questions about the
indigenous population cannot be answered, it is still informative to pose the questions
and glean as much as possible from the available information.
Recommendations for Future Investigations
The Operation 1 excavations identify several areas that would be suitable for
future investigations, including Suboperations A and B, G, and H. These
recommendations are based both on the artifact density and the types of artifacts
encountered in each suboperation. A survey of a different type is needed to explore the
area around the spring to determine the extent of prehistoric occupation of the area by
indigenous groups. The same could be said for other areas of Rancho El Saladito that
are too heavily overgrown to permit intensive archaeological survey. The area along the
baseline may be heavily eroded, but it is possible that some intact prehistoric sites
remain, given the lithic artifact density and range of forms.
On a different scale, it is vital to encourage future scholarship in this region by
creating a multidisciplinary forum or network for researchers to facilitate communication
among the varying approaches. It could be as simple as an annual conference or
318

thematic presentations at one of the existing conferences, but it would serve to
encourage interest in the region and to build a network of scholars in varying disciplines
and make possible the requisite multidisciplined approach.
Interpretations and Conclusions
A wide variety of activities are represented in the archaeological record at
Rancho El Saladito. The ceramic artifacts provide testament to the extensive trade
relationships that stretched at first to Spain through central and coastal Mexico and later
to England through Matamoros. The prevalence of early Majolica types (Huejotzingo
Blue on White, Puebla Blue on White, and San Elizario Polychrome) in the northeastern
corner of the study area (Operation 1, Suboperations A and B) to the exclusion of
English whitewares, indicates that this was the earliest area of occupation, dating from
the 1750s. Alternatively, English whitewares and later Majolica types (San Diego,
Monterey, and Guanajuato polychromes) are the predominate types in Operation 1,
Suboperation C, which is located about 150 meters to the southwest of Suboperations
A and B.
Thus, at Rancho El Saladito there are at least two temporally distinct
occupations on the east side of the arroyo. Based on the ethnohistorical record,
Suboperations A and B may represent the first settlement at what was then known as El
Rancho San Lorenzo de las Minas. This location would have been strategically close to
the Río Grande for access to fresh water. As the extended family grew through births
and marriages, more jacales were built to the south and southwest along the peninsula
that is formed by the intersection of the Arroyo El Saladito and the Río Grande until the
settlement area reached an approximate size of 20,000 m2. This project did not survey
the entire limits of the original porción, so it is not possible to state with certainty as to
319

how the inhabitants managed their herds or where they raised crops. The animal herds
may have been kept close to the human occupation at first, but as the population of both
grew, alternate strategies would have likely developed. Herders on foot might have
successfully tended their smaller, tamer herds of mixed animals, but larger and perhaps
feral herds of cattle would have required the use of horse-mounted vaqueros.
The northern frontier of New Spain is generally thought to have been an isolated
place where vast lands were occupied by relatively few people. Therefore it is not
surprising that despite access to extensive trade networks, evidence of the colonists’
self-sufficiency is also found in the archaeological record. For example, a large porcion
of the ceramic collection is locally-made utilitarian wares that appear to be used
consistently throughout the occupation. The scissor handle and the thimble from
Operation 1 support ethnographic evidence that women made most, if not all, of the
family’s clothes and blankets. While cloth may have been purchased for clothing,
sheep’s wool was used to make quilts and bedding. The size of the thimble suggests it
was used by either a petite adult, or possibly by a child.
Other metal objects from Operation 1, like the engraved utensil handle and the
higas or ruidos suggest locally-made products. The token with the name “Baring Lxon”
embossed on it may represent a form of local currency. The farrier’s cast-offs from
Operation 2 are by-products of blacksmithing, while horse or mule raising is indicated
by the number of buckles and shoe fragments recovered. Also at Operation 2 the
numerous well-worn iron implements reveal the extent of the twentieth-century
agricultural efforts.
While most artifacts have a utilitarian purpose, some objects like the glass bottle
stopper and olive glass fragments from bottles that probably contained wine represents
320

both access to trade relationships and possession of a disposable income. Other objects
like the cross pendant or milagro tell us something about the owner’s spiritual beliefs.
Excavations at Rancho El Saladito performed for this dissertation, reveal only a
sample of what potentially can be learned about Spanish colonial ranching settlements.
With more resources to clear the area investigated as Operation 1 of vegetation, it
would likely be possible to define individual housing units, activity areas, and distinct
features. The archaeological deposits are neither deep nor well-stratified, considering
the consistent mixing of pre-historic with historic artifacts, thus large-scale horizontal
excavations may be the key to future investigations. At the very least, this dissertation
demonstrates that an ethnohistorical approach, using archival, genealogical, and oral
histories to supplement the archaeological record is an effective methodology and useful
for future investigations.
