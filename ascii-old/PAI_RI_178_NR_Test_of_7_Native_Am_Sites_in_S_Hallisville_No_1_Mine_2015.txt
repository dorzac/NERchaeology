ABSTRACT
Personnel from Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted test excavations to assess the
National Register of Historic Places eligibility of seven Native American archeological sites—
41RK674, 41RK680, 41RK693, 41RK695, 41RK703, 41RK704, and 41RK729—in northeast
Rusk County, Texas, in April–August 2014. This work was done for North American Coal
Corporation–Sabine Mine in compliance with the requirements of Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Railroad Commission of Texas. The
excavations consisted of 92 m2 (80.7 m3) of hand-dug test units and 63 backhoe trenches (702 m2).
Testing determined that the sites have components dating as early as the Middle Archaic
period (ca. 3500 b.c.) and as late as the Late Caddo period (late a.d. 1400s), with Late Archaic,
Woodland, Early Caddo, and Middle Caddo components represented as well. Four sites have
moderate to high densities of cultural materials representing substantial Native American
occupations. Sites 41RK674 and 41RK693 are interpreted as Late Caddo and Middle Caddo
farmsteads. Site 41RK703 has prominent Middle Archaic and probably Late Archaic components,
with lesser Woodland and Early Caddo components. The primary components at 41RK704
are Woodland, and a secondary component is Early Caddo. The other three sites were used
less intensively, with 41RK680 having a Woodland component, 41RK695 having a Late Caddo
component, and 41RK729 having an unidentified Caddo component.
The data from some of these sites, especially 41RK674, 41RK693, 41RK703, and 41RK704,
are useful for gaining a better understanding of how Native Americans used this part of the
Cherokee Bayou valley, but none of the seven sites offers to contribute additional important
information. Hence, all seven are judged ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places, and no further archeological work is recommended.

chapter 1: INTRODUCTION AND PROJECT
AREA DESCRIPTION

This report details the results of archeological investigations conducted for
North American Coal Corporation–Sabine Mine in Area W of the South Hallsville
No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit in Rusk County, Texas. These investigations were performed
by Prewitt and Associates, Inc., from April to August 2014 and consisted of test
excavations to assess the National Register of Historic Places eligibility of seven
prehistoric sites: 41RK674, 41RK680, 41RK693, 41RK695, 41RK703, 41RK704, and
41RK729. The work was done to assist North American Coal Corporation–Sabine
Mine in complying with the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Railroad Commission of Texas. These
sites were recorded in 2012 during archeological and historical resources surveys
of 4,392 acres in Area W and were recommended as needing further work to assess
their National Register eligibility (Dockall et al. 2014).
The remainder of this chapter describes the project area and its environmental
setting. Chapter 2 discusses previous archeological investigations in the area and
presents background information on Native American use of this part of northeast
Texas. Chapter 3 describes the field, laboratory, and analysis methods used in this
investigation. Chapter 4 details the work done at the seven sites and what was
discovered. Finally, Chapter 5 offers conclusions based on this work and provides
National Register of Historic Places eligibility assessments. The three appendixes
present metric data for the stone tools recovered and the results of macrobotanical
and radiocarbon analyses.
The seven sites are in northeast Rusk County, south of Cherokee Bayou
and northwest of the town of Tatum (Figure 1.1). Cherokee Bayou flows from west
to east along the north edge of Area W, and thus much of the land there is lowlying floodplain. Moving south from the floodplain, the central and southern parts
of Area W consist of Pleistocene terrace deposits and Eocene uplands. At least six
streams incise the uplands and flow north to Cherokee Bayou; four extend well back
from the valley wall. Four of the tested sites (41RK680, 41RK703, 41RK704, and
41RK729) are on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain, two (41RK674 and 41RK693) are
on the valley wall, and one (41RK695) is in the uplands along one of the tributary
streams.
The floodplain of Cherokee Bayou, which flows into the Sabine River beyond
the eastern boundary of the project area, is characterized by numerous sloughs,
flood chutes, backswamps, and small abandoned channels of the bayou, as well as
rises that probably are low Holocene or Pleistocene terrace remnants. Floodplain

Chapter 1: Introduction and Project Area Description
soils are dominated by Laneville loam, Owentown fine sandy loam, and Mattex clay
loam (along stream channels). Each of these soils, which formed in clayey and loamy
alluvium, is deep, moderately well drained, and slowly permeable (Griffith 2000).
Most of the floodplain soils are partially hydric, meaning that the upper part of the
soil profile is sufficiently saturated to create anaerobic conditions for parts of the
year. Such soils are characteristic of wetland areas.
Pleistocene terraces between the existing floodplain and the south valley
wall are limited to two parts of Area W, one in the central part (between and below
41RK674 and 41RK693) and the other on the eastern edge, which is a continuation of
a large terrace system to the east. Both are remnants of ancient terraces of the Sabine
River. Each area is characterized by gently downsloping terrain toward Cherokee
Bayou with interfluve ridges and toeslopes created by wet-weather drainages. The
terrace remnants appear to mantle the lower toeslopes of the southern valley wall.
Soils on the terraces are Laneville loam, Latex very fine sandy loam, Owentown fine
sandy loam, Sawlit-Sawtown complex, and Woodtell loam. These soils are moderately
well drained and slowly permeable (Griffith 2000).
The valley wall south of Cherokee Bayou abruptly rises in some places
from 250 to 310 ft above mean sea level over distances of only 120 m to a series of
prominent interfluves along the top of the valley wall, separated by small unnamed
streams that flow north. Principal soils associated with the valley wall and higher
bluffs overlooking the floodplain are Kirvin fine sandy loam and Tenaha loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000). Both soils are characteristic of steep to moderately steep slopes
and convex side slopes.
The uplands extend ca. 5.0 to 5.5 km southeast of the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain to the south edge of Area W near Tatum. Several different soils are
mapped in the uplands: Betis loamy fine sand, Bowie very fine sandy loam, Darco
loamy fine sand, Gallime-Alazan complex, Kirvin fine sandy loam, Kirvin soils
graded, Latex very fine sandy loam, Lilbert loamy fine sand, and Rentzel loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000). All of these are deep, excessively to well-drained, moderately
permeable sandy upland soils.
Subsurface geological units in the area are Tertiary in age and consist of
the Wilcox Group (undivided) overlain in areas by the Carrizo Sand (Henry and
Basciano 1979:2). The sites are within a geological structure referred to as the
Sabine Uplift. The Sabine Uplift region represents some of the region’s best sources
of lignite, having some of the thickest and most continuous seams (Kaiser et al.
1980). Alluvial sands and muds deposited by ancient river systems that meandered
across flat coastal plains during the Tertiary make up the Wilcox Group (Fisher
and McGowan 1967). The depositional environment of the Sabine Uplift and the
Wilcox Group was a transitional zone between Tertiary alluvial and deltaic plains
(Kaiser et al. 1980).
The project area is within the Piney Woods region of northeast Texas, where
shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), loblolly pine (P. taeda), and mixed hardwoods
including various oaks and black hickory (Carya texana) dominate the uplands.
Floodplain and bottomland settings are characterized by hardwood stands that

3

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
include sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), American elm (Ulmus americana),
and bald cypress (Taxodium distichum). The plant communities observed today
have been altered by historic and modern land use practices. Since the 1830s, native
hardwood and pine forests have been selectively altered by cutting and recutting
to clear fields for planting and to harvest timber. In some areas, filling of sloughs,
plowing, and leveling have also modified the natural topography.
The sites are within the northwestern section of the Austroriparian biotic
province (Blair 1950). Most of the animal species characteristic of the Piney Woods
and the Austroriparian province are adapted primarily to woodland and aquatic
habitats. According to Blair (1950:99), approximately 47 mammal species, 29 species
of snakes, 10 lizard species, 2 species of land turtles, and 18 urodeles typically occur in
this province in Texas. A few of the more common mammals are opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus
subflavus), red bat (Lasurius borealis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern gray
squirrel (S. carolinensis), Baird’s pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), hispidcotton rat
(Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(S. aquaticus). Other important mammals include raccoon (Procyon lotor), whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor canadensis), muskrat (Ondatra
zibethicus), and mink (Mustela vison). Black bear (Ursus americanus) was common
in northeastern Texas into the early part of the twentieth century.
The region has a humid subtropical climate. The average winter temperature
is 46ºF, and the average summer temperature is 81ºF. Total annual precipitation
is 45–50 inches and falls primarily between April and October. Average annual
snowfall is 1.0–1.5 inches (Griffith 2000:10; Orton 1975). The first freeze is typically
in late November, and the last freeze is typically in mid to late March, providing a
growing season of 240–245 days.

CHAPTER 2: archeological background

Previous cultural resources investigations
Many archeological investigations have been conducted in the vicinity of the
current project area (Figure 2.1). These include previous work in the eastern part
of the Rusk Permit and projects at South Hallsville/South Marshall Mine, Marshall
Mine, Martin Lake and Martin Lake Mine, and Oak Hill Mine.
Rusk Permit Area
In 2008–2009, North American Coal Corporation–Sabine Mine initiated work
south of the Sabine River in connection with a proposed new mining area known
as the Rusk Permit. To date, four archeological projects have been conducted there
(other than the one reported here). The first was an intensive pedestrian survey
of 6,925 acres in Area V straddling the Panola-Rusk County line (Dockall et al.
2010). This survey resulted in the discovery and documentation of 53 previously
unrecorded sites and collection of additional information on 4 previously recorded
sites. Of the total, 19 are prehistoric Native American sites, 35 are historic sites, and
3 are both prehistoric and historic. Fifteen of the prehistoric components are lithic
scatters, 6 contain materials relating to Caddo occupations, and 1 has Woodland-age
materials. Twenty-nine of the historic components are farmsteads or house sites, 4
are cemeteries, 2 are improved springs, 2 are roads, and 1 is a cluster of house sites
or farmsteads that formed a community.
The second project in the Rusk Permit area consisted of test excavations at
three Native American sites: 41RK557, 41RK558, and 41RK562 (Dockall and Fields
2011). The earliest evidence of occupation is limited to a single Evans point denoting
possible Middle Archaic period use and several Gary points indicating possible
Woodland period usage from 41HS557. There are no substantial deposits associated
with either Archaic or Woodland occupations at this site, however. Woodland to Early
Caddo occupation is best represented by the assemblage from 41RK562. It consists
of a series of heavily reworked and fragmentary Friley arrow points in association
with a small number of sherds that probably relate to Williams Plain, Marksville, and
Coles Creek pottery. The absence of features at this site makes it hard to say much
about the nature of the activities that occurred there, but the overall sparseness of
materials suggests limited use, perhaps as a short-term campsite.
The third project consisted of survey of the Rusk Permit Area W comprising
4,392 acres west of Area V (Dockall et al. 2014). Unlike the initial Rusk Permit

survey area to the east, Area W included floodplain associated with Cherokee
Bayou rather than with the Sabine River. This survey resulted in the discovery and
documentation of 66 previously unrecorded sites. Of the total, 33 are prehistoric
Native American sites, 22 are historic sites, and 11 are both prehistoric and historic.
Thirty-seven of the prehistoric components are lithic scatters, and 7 have both
lithic and ceramic artifacts. Of the 33 historic components, 30 are farmsteads, 1 is a

barn, 1 a roadway, and 1 is a cemetery. The historical resources survey documented
67 historic-age resources consisting of 41 domestic, 16 agricultural, 6 industrial,
2 religious, 1 funerary, and 1 transportation property types constructed between
about 1878 and 2000.
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., later conducted test excavations at 41RK551,
41RK571, 41RK582 and relocated the historic Ware cemetery (41RK572) in Area V
(Norment et al. 2014). Site 41RK551 is the mid-nineteenth-century Ware plantation,
and 41RK571 and 41RK582 are the mid–late-nineteenth-century Hendrick
plantation. The main part of the Ware plantation site (41RK551), which probably
contained the main house and several outbuildings, is on a ridge top that has suffered
from many years of plowing, as well as removal of structural remains in advance
of plowing. Hence, what remains of the buildings that once stood in this area are
mostly scattered brick fragments and artifacts. The only identified cultural feature
with integrity is in the southeast corner of the site, on the slope below the ridge
top. A chimney base and some footing stones representing an outlying building are
present here. It appears that this building was a domicile, and it is speculated that
it may have been occupied by slaves or an overseer. Test excavations at the Hendrick
plantation (41RK571) identified multiple chimney foundations and other structural
remains of the main house, a detached kitchen, and at least four other buildings,
including a possible smokehouse and several houses where slaves may have lived.
Other as-yet-unidentified buildings that were part of the complex probably are
present as well. One such building may have been in an outlying part of the complex
at 41RK582, just northwest of 41RK571.
One important site that is just outside the north boundary of the Rusk Permit
and that was known long before work in the permit area began is the Hudnall-Pirtle
site (41RK4). It is a very large (1,100x400 m) Early Caddo civic and ceremonial center.
The site is on a low terrace near the Sabine River. A. M. Woolsey first recorded this
site in the 1930s for the University of Texas based on an informant’s report. Woolsey
recorded it as a single mound. Later the site saw limited testing by Buddy Calvin Jones,
but this work was never reported. In 1989 and 1990, the staff of the Texas Historical
Commission and volunteers conducted test excavations (Bruseth 1991; Bruseth and
Perttula 2006). The site apparently dates mostly to a.d. 1000–1200 and contains
eight constructed mounds, three borrow pits, a plaza, and residential areas. HudnallPirtle must have been the focal point of a sizeable community of Caddo Indians in
this part of the Sabine River valley, and it is possible that associated residential sites
are scattered across nearby areas. Determining whether this is the case for the Rusk
Permit was one of the main objectives of the testing project reported in this volume.
South Hallsville/South Marshall Mine
Since the mid 1970s, some 39,000 acres on the north side of the Sabine
River have been surveyed archeologically in connection with North American Coal
Corporation–Sabine Mine’s South Hallsville/South Marshall lignite mine. The east
edge of this mine approaches Colliers Creek, a tributary of Eightmile Creek, and it
extends west to encompass parts of the valleys of Potters, Spring, Brandy Branch,
Hatley, Hardin, Rogers, and Clarks Creeks. At least 57 projects have been undertaken

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
here, resulting in the recording of more than 600 archeological sites (Table 2.1). The
vast majority are known only from survey-level data, but 4 have seen extensive
excavations, and another 95 have seen varying amounts of test excavations.
Some of the tested and excavated sites date mostly to the Archaic, Woodland,
or Early to Middle Caddo periods, but most have Late Caddo components that relate
to the Nadaco Caddo Pine Tree Mound community, which appeared in the a.d. 1300s
and endured for several hundred years. The focal point of this community was the
ceremonial center at 41HS15 on Potters Creek, which was surrounded by a village
nucleus of about 15 household compounds (Fields and Gadus 2012:646–651). At
least 25 other residential areas and probably short-term campsites are on Starkey
and Potters Creeks nearby, mostly in a 5.5-km stretch downstream; and at least 15
other sites, probably a mix of short-term campsites and more-intensively occupied
residential locales and including 1 other mound site, are scattered along other
Sabine River tributaries to the west and the adjacent upland margins overlooking
the Sabine floodplain.
Fields and Gadus (2012:654–664) argue that the home territory of the
Nadaco Caddo extended well beyond the surveyed area at the mine, perhaps over
an area roughly 50 km north-south by 60 km east-west and encompassing some
2,400 km2, with the Sabine River flowing through the middle. People were not
distributed evenly throughout this area, though. As noted, the main village was on
Potters Creek north of the river, anchored by 41HS15 at its north end. The rest of
the community appears to have been more rural, although perhaps at two different
scales. Other north-side tributary valleys, extending approximately from Mason
Creek on the west to perhaps Eightmile, Caddo, or Jackson Creek on the east, may
have supported moderately scattered settlements. The entire territory south of the
river, accounting for well over half of it and including the Rusk Permit area, appears
to have been sparsely settled.
Marshall Mine
In 2010–2011, Prewitt and Associates conducted archeological and historical
resources surveys within 2,144 acres of land in the proposed Marshall Mine in
Harrison and Panola Counties on the north side of the Sabine River east of the Rusk
Permit (Griffith et al. 2012). The archeological survey resulted in documentation
of 29 sites: 8 Native American, 18 historic, and 3 with both prehistoric and historic
components. Six of the Native American components contain materials relating to
occupations by Caddo Indians, including the C. D. Marsh site (41HS269), which is
one of the historic cemeteries that Buddy Calvin Jones used to define the Kinsloe
focus (Jones 1968). These sites were associated with the Late Caddo community
on Potters Creek to the northwest. The other Native American components are
sparse lithic scatters of unknown association. Eighteen of the historic sites are
farmsteads, 1 is a barn, and 2 are artifact scatters; they date almost entirely to
the twentieth century, with a few being associated with the Depression-era Sabine
Farms resettlement project. A subsequent survey of a 725-acre expansion of the
Marshall Mine westward onto the Sabine River floodplain documented 8 Native
American sites (3 with Caddo components) and 1 historic site (Burden et al. 2015).

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
Martin Lake and Martin Lake Mine
Survey of more than 25,000 acres at the Martin Lake Mine east and south
of the Rusk Permit indicates that Native American sites are not frequent there.
The earliest survey work in that vicinity was a brief investigation of Rusk County
conducted by Jack Hughes in 1948, during which he recorded four sites (Hughes
1948). Three of these sites were 41RK3 (Millsey Williamson), 41RK35 (Taylor), and
41RK36, which were later revisited and further recorded in a larger survey of the
Martin Lake tracts by Andrew McDonald (1972) for the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project. The later survey documented 46 prehistoric and historic archeological sites
within the Martin Lake impoundment area. The Millsey Williamson site, with
evidence of historic Caddo occupation, was one of seven sites that Buddy Calvin
Jones (1968) used to define the Kinsloe focus.
The Texas Archeological Survey performed testing at four sites (41RK21,
41RK32, 41RK36, and 41RK39) and more-extensive work at a fifth site (41RK19)
at Martin Lake (Clark and Ivey 1974). Site 41RK39 was documented as a
multicomponent site beginning in the Late Archaic period and continuing into the
Late Caddo period. Middle and Late Caddo occupations were documented at 41RK19,
41RK32, and 41RK39, with 41RK19 containing a single Caddo house, a possible
granary, and two middens dating mostly to the Middle Caddo period (Perttula 2014).
Site 41RK36 was identified as a contact-period Caddo occupation and contained
European trade items. No Woodland or Early Caddo components were identified at
any of the tested sites.
In 1981, the Texas Archeological Survey (Moncure and Jackson 1982)
conducted intensive pedestrian survey of the railroad and transmission line corridor
for the proposed Martin Lake Mine. No prehistoric sites were identified, but one
historic site (41RK104, the Thomas Jefferson Walling cabin) was recorded. This
site subsequently saw extensive research and data recovery to mitigate its loss
(Moncure 1984), and the cabin was restored and relocated to the grounds of the
Depot Museum in Henderson, Texas.
Espey, Huston and Associates (1983b) conducted a 19.5 percent stratified
survey of Martin Lake Mine Areas A, B, and C in 1983. Thirty-five 100-acre areas
were selected for survey, and 27 sites were identified. These consisted of 5 prehistoric
lithic sites, 4 undifferentiated Caddo occupations, 2 Late Caddo sites, 9 historic house
sites, 2 historic cemeteries, 1 historic sawmill, 3 undifferentiated historic sites, and 1
site with both prehistoric and historic components. All sites were in upland settings.
Two of the Caddo sites contained intact subsurface midden deposits, and 1 of the
historic sites was a late 1800s sawmill. Another set of Espey, Huston and Associates
projects during this time included the following: test excavations at prehistoric
sites 41PN14 (Early and Late Caddo?) and 41PN25 (Late Caddo); archival research
for historic sites 41PN32 and 41PN39 and the historic communities of Sugar Hill
and Harris Chapel; survey focused on 10 areas totaling 3,550 acres in which 11
prehistoric and 7 historic sites were found; testing at 41PN57, an undifferentiated
Caddo site; and survey of 550 acres in which 3 prehistoric sites were found (Espey,
Huston and Associates, Inc. 1984b).

Chapter 2: Archeological Background
A subsequent survey by Espey, Huston and Associates of 13,000 acres within
Martin Lake Mine Areas A, B, and C recorded 30 new sites—4 with prehistoric
components and 27 with historic components—and revisited 43 previously recorded
sites (Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. 1986). Archeological testing was conducted
on one previously recorded historic site (41PN42), and ethnohistorical research
was done for 41PN29 and 41PN26, also previously recorded. Later, Foster (1992)
completed HABS documentation of the John T. Brooks house and its associated
outbuildings at 41PN29, a nineteenth-century farmstead.
In 1988, Espey, Huston and Associates completed limited testing at four
historic sites at Martin Lake Mine—41PN75, 41PN78, 41PN91, and 41PN94—and
survey-level investigations at a fifth site, 41PN96, and limited work at a possible
prehistoric cemetery, 41PN48 (Kotter et al. 1988). Only 41PN75, the Mudcat Chimney
site, was judged to warrant further work, and data recovery investigations were
performed the following year (Kotter and Moore 1990). The excavations included
work in trash deposits in the yard of a house that had been occupied between 1880
and 1955.
In 1990, Espey, Huston and Associates surveyed 2,980 additional acres in
Martin Lake Mine Area B (Kotter et al. 1992). Much of the project Area Was in upland
settings, and just 2 prehistoric sites were found. Both were very low-density lithic
scatters with no temporal diagnostics. Eleven historic sites were located representing
mid- and late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century occupations. In 1992, Nash et al.
(1994) completed National Register testing at 4 late-nineteenth- to early-twentiethcentury farmsteads—41PN99, 41PN102, 41PN104, and 41PN115—in Martin Lake
Mine Area B.
In 1996, archeologists with Espey, Huston and Associates surveyed 2,378
additional acres in Martin Lake Mine Areas A and B (Taylor and Tate 1997). Thirty
prehistoric and 17 historic sites were investigated. Most of the prehistoric sites were
low- to very low-density lithic scatters unattributed to a specific time period. The
historic sites represented primarily early- to mid-twentieth-century farmsteads and
tenant homes that had been removed or were in very bad condition.
In 2000, PBS&J conducted archival research to assess the National Register
eligibility status of historic site 41RK443 in Martin Lake Mine, Area A-IV (Victor
2000). In 2005–2009, PBS&J undertook several other projects at the mine. These
include the following: surveys of 2,646 acres resulting in the discovery of 1 prehistoric
site and 29 historic sites (Coke et al. 2006; Dixon et al. 2006; Sherman et al. 2005);
National Register eligibility testing at ephemeral prehistoric sites 41PN124,
41PN131, 41PN137, 41PN214, 41RK194, and 41RK455 (Dixon et al. 2007; Sherman
et al. 2008, 2009); testing at multicomponent site 41PN144, followed by data recovery
excavations focusing on the early-nineteenth-century component there (Dixon et al.
n.d.); and survey of a 376-acre renewal area that resulted in the identification and
recording of three historic sites (41PN251, 41PN252, and 41PN254), one prehistoric
site (41PN253), and five prehistoric isolated finds (Watkins 2009).

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
Oak Hill Mine
The Texas Archeological Survey conducted a reconnaissance-level survey
of the Mill Creek area for Oak Hill Mine in Rusk County southwest of the Rusk
Permit area in 1980 (Moncure and Jackson 1980). The entire survey Area Was in
an upland setting and was assessed as having a low potential to contain prehistoric
cultural resources. Only four sites were documented. The results of this survey were
used to develop a predictive modeling tool for future planning phases of the Martin
Lake Mine area. Moncure and Jackson (1980:49) identified four probability zones
for archeological resources. Zone 1 was an area of high probability and consisted
of locations within 200 m of reliable water resources. Zone 2, moderate probability,
included places in excess of 200 m from reliable water sources but with other resource
potential such as terrain likely to have been used for game lookouts or other food
resources. Zone 3 was of low probability and consisted of localities in excess of
200 m from reliable water and an absence of secondary resources. Zone 4 comprised
all areas so disturbed as to have no remaining potential for intact archeological
resources. A later survey in Oak Hill Mine (Jackson 1982) applied the predictive
model developed in the earlier reconnaissance survey (Moncure and Jackson 1980).
The survey covered 6,500 acres and resulted in the documentation of 3 prehistoric
sites and 15 historic sites.
In the mid 1980s, Espey, Huston and Associates surveyed 346 acres at Oak
Hill Mine (Jones et al. 1987). One prehistoric site and 1 historic site were found, and
41 previously recorded sites were investigated. Prehistoric sites included campsites
and lithic and ceramic scatters, while historic sites were mostly house sites and
farmsteads dating to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In 1989, Rogers et al.
(1992) surveyed 2,280 acres at Oak Hill Mine. Twenty new sites (14 with prehistoric
components and 9 with historic components) and 3 previously recorded sites were
investigated, 5 of which were considered to warrant further work to assess their
eligibility for National Register listing.
Espey, Huston and Associates completed data recovery investigations at
the Millville Mill site, 41RK223, at Oak Hill Mine in 1993 (Foster 2000). The work
involved archival research, excavation, and architectural documentation at a
nineteenth-century mill associated with the town of Millville. The same year, Espey,
Huston and Associates undertook National Register testing at eight sites at Oak
Hill (Rogers et al. 1994). Historic sites 41RK86A and 41RK108 and prehistoric sites
41RK216 and 41RK218 were judged ineligible for National Register listing, while
prehistoric sites 41RK214, 41RK215, 41RK222, and 41RK223 were considered
eligible based on their potential to yield important information about the Woodland
and Middle Caddo archeology of the region. One of these sites, Oak Hill Village
(41RK214), saw extensive data recovery excavations in 1994–1995 (Rogers and
Perttula 2004). The site contained materials relating to occupations from the late
Paleoindian period through the Late Caddo period, but the predominant occupation
related to a large Middle Caddo (a.d. 1150–1450) village with over 40 structures.
In 1997, archeologists from Espey, Huston and Associates conducted
additional survey work at Oak Hill Mine (Skokan et al. 1997). National Register

Chapter 2: Archeological Background
eligibility testing was conducted at one of the sites found (41RK305), and this was
followed shortly by data recovery efforts (Cliff and Sills 2004). The investigations
revealed that the site was occupied between 1815 and 1860, and glass trade beads
found there suggested that it may have been used by Cherokee or another immigrant
Native American group.
In 1999–2000, PBS&J conducted National Register testing at sites
41RK107, 41RK240, 41RK242, 41RK243, 41RK276, and 41RK286 at Oak Hill Mine
(Sherman 2001). Site 41RK240 was considered to contain important information
for understanding the prehistory of the area, while 41RK107, 41RK242, 41RK243,
41RK276, and 41RK286 were judged to lack such information.
In 2003, PBS&J conducted National Register testing at prehistoric site
41RK328 at Oak Hill Mine (Cliff et al. 2004). It was interpreted as a large, diffuse
site that could have remains dating to the Archaic, Woodland, and Caddo periods.
No further work was considered warranted.
In 2004, PBS&J continued testing prehistoric sites at Oak Hill, working on
41RK295 and 41RK304 (Cliff and Sills 2005). Site 41RK295 was interpreted as a
large, diffuse site occupied perhaps in the Late Archaic and Early Caddo periods,
while 41RK304 was a small lithic site probably occupied in the Archaic period.
Neither was considered worthy of additional work.
In 2012, Atkins conducted additional investigations at four sites (41RK322,
41RK375, 41RK414, and 41RK233) (Sherman 2012; Sherman et al. 2013). Testing
showed that 41RK322 is an ephemeral late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century
artifact scatter. Site 41RK375 represents a Middle Caddo residential occupation.
Site 41RK414 is a diffuse, low-density prehistoric lithic artifact scatter. Shovel
testing at 41RK233 showed that the landform containing the site is eroded and
lacks significant cultural deposits. None of these sites were deemed eligible for
National Register listing.
Native american cultural chronology
Evidence of Native American occupation within the middle Sabine River
basin goes back at least 12,000 years and extends as late as the 1800s. This section
provides a discussion of how sites in this area may relate to prehistoric and early
historic utilization of the middle Sabine River drainage and northeast Texas in
general. The cultural history sequence used here is based largely on a temporal
framework derived from Story’s (1990:168–177, 213–222, 293–342) extensive review
of the archeology of the Texas Gulf coastal plain. Additional sources of information
include Perttula (1992, 1996, 2004, 2005), Girard et al.’s (2014) recent book on the
Caddo, and the exhibit entitled “Tejas: Life and Times of the Caddo” on the Texas
Beyond History website (www.texasbeyondhistory.net).
Paleoindian Period: 10,000–7,000 b.c.
The earliest evidence of Native American occupation of the northeast Texas
and northwest Louisiana region is attributable to the Paleoindian period. Projectile

15

points such as Clovis, Scottsbluff, San Patrice, Dalton, and Meserve, as well as
other distinctive tools like Albany scrapers, Red River knives, and Dalton adzes are
associated with this early period (Story 1990:177). Often these early artifacts are
recovered from nonaggrading upland settings where they occur as isolated finds
or are mixed with artifacts from later occupations such that little can be discerned
concerning early lifeways, other than that a particular landform had been a site of
occupation. Even with this paucity of information, investigators have concluded that
early adaptive strategies involved high residential mobility over large territories
with short-lived occupations by small groups who practiced a generalized subsistence
strategy focused on hunting. Population densities were low, and hence there was
little competition for resources. Constant group movement as well as fluidity of
group composition were highly adaptive means of avoiding or resolving stressful
economic or social issues (Story 1990:177; Story et al. 1990:425–426).
Evidence of early occupations near the Rusk Permit area consists mostly of
isolated projectile points, such as Dalton dart points from 41HS574 and 41HS588
(Dockall et al. 2008:119; Gadus et al. 2006:68) and San Patrice points from 41HS469
and 41HS890 (Keller 1994:11, 12; Wilder et al. 2007:56). Southwest of the project
area, the Oak Hill Village site (41RK214) produced a number of San Patrice points
(n = 11) as well as Dalton (n = 2) and Scottsbluff (n = 1) points (Rogers and Perttula
2004:141–143). The San Patrice and Dalton points suggest a strong late Paleoindian
period occupation of the site. Unfortunately, as is often the case, other artifacts or
cultural features that would provide a more complete understanding of what this
occupation entailed could not be associated with the points.
Sites with early artifacts to the north and east of the project area in the Red
River drainage include the Jake Martin site in northeast Upshur County (Davis and
Davis 1960), the Forrest Murphy site in Marion County (Story 1990:180), and the
John Pearce site in Caddo Parish, Louisiana (Webb et al. 1971). The Jake Martin
site yielded two San Patrice points, a Dalton point, and an early-style end scraper
(Story 1990:199). The Forrest Murphy site (41MR62), on a high terrace above Big
Cypress Creek, yielded an array of point forms including Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
San Patrice, and possible Scottsbluff, along with blade end scrapers (Perttula
2004:373; Story 1990:180, 184–185).
The John Pearce site is of particular interest in that San Patrice points
make up 45 percent (n = 62) of the points recovered from that site. Also found
were a number of lanceolate points representing Pelican, Meserve, and Clovis
types (Webb et al. 1971:11–19). Although little in the way of habitation features
or subsistence remains could be associated with these points, the variety and
concentration of other stone tools in the assemblage give an indication that this
early site may have functioned as a base camp within a wider settlement system
(Webb et al. 1971:40–41). Type varieties within the San Patrice points, two of
which were identified at the John Pearce site, suggest that the site was occupied
repeatedly by multiple related groups of people, possibly signaling the very early
beginnings of localized group territories. Tools other than projectile points include
end scrapers, side scrapers, burins, denticulates, and retouched flakes, all of which
suggest processing of resources gained through the hunt (Webb et al. 1971:40–47).

Chapter 2: Archeological Background
Tools missing from the assemblage, such as adzes, choppers, mullers and nutting
stones, and other ground stone tools, underscore the limited importance of plant
processing. Hunting appears to have been the cornerstone of the adaptive strategy
of these early Native Americans.
More recently, a series of lithic artifacts has been described from the Twin
Bird Islands site (16CD118) in Caddo Parish, Louisiana (Pevny 2014). The collections
include Dalton, San Patrice (varieties Hope, St. Johns, Brazos Fish Tail, and Leaf
River), Albany scrapers, a series of side- and corner-notched Archaic projectile
points, unifacial tools, and modified flakes. Although the materials are from
unsystematic collections, Pevny’s technological and functional analysis confirms
earlier interpretations of manufacturing trajectories detailed by Webb et al. (1971)
for San Patrice bifaces at the John Pearce site.
Archaic Period: 7,000–200 b.c.
Functional diversification of tool assemblages, including the addition of
ground stone tools for plant processing, indicates a change in adaptive strategy
that marks the Archaic period. Expedient tools are also an important part of these
assemblages, and there appears to have been limited tool curation and recycling
and more frequent use of local raw materials for tool production compared to
Paleoindian period assemblages (Story 1990:213; Story et al. 1990:426). And as
possibly seen beginning with the late Paleoindian San Patrice point varieties,
distinctive regional artifact styles became more pronounced during the Archaic
period, and the first true cemeteries signal stronger territorial identifications. Based
on these characteristics, adaptive strategies during the Archaic period appear to
have involved seasonal hunting and foraging of a wide variety of resources, with
plant foods attaining greater importance than earlier. Overall resource exploitation
patterns were intensive and more focused geographically. Decreasing residential
mobility heightened the importance of establishing trade relationships and building
alliances as mechanisms for solving economic and social problems that Paleoindian
groups managed simply by moving camps.
Archaic sites have greater accumulations of occupational debris than
earlier sites, and this may be attributed to repeated short-term occupations or
fewer longer-term occupations at the same locations. The impetus for changes in
mobility, subsistence, and technology during the Archaic may be attributed in part
to environmental changes that occurred across southeastern North America between
7000 and 3000 b.c. (Delcourt and Delcourt 1985:19–20). The Holocene thermal
maximum (Hypsithermal) may have had a significant influence on subsistence and
technology because it changed regional floral and faunal patterns.
Although the remains of occupations by Archaic peoples are numerous in
northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana, especially the occupations associated
with Late Archaic groups, the sequence of projectile point styles through this long
period and their associations with other artifact and ecofact assemblages are not
well established. Again, as with the Paleoindian period, problems lie with the lack
of well-stratified and well-dated sites and the poor preservation of faunal and

17

18

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
vegetal materials. However, some Archaic point types are common within the region,
and their relative frequencies at particular sites do provide some clues about the
development of local group identities. For the Early to Middle Archaic period, these
include points typed as Johnson, Wells, Bulverde, Morrill, Carrollton, Dawson,
Neches River, and Motley, while later Archaic period types include Yarbrough, Elam,
Ellis, Edgewood, Kent, and perhaps Gary.
Data recovery investigations at three multicomponent sites near the present
project area suggest that early Wells and later Yarbrough dart points mark local
adaptations during the Archaic period. Site 41HS74 (Heartfield, Price and Greene,
Inc. 1988) is on Hatley Creek, a north tributary of the Sabine River, north of the
current project area. This site has an Early to Middle Archaic component marked
by Wells (n = 6) and Carrollton (n = 11) dart points, which together make up
23 percent of the typeable dart points recovered (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc.
1988:7-8–7-20). However, Middle to Late Archaic period points constitute 50 percent
of the typeable points, suggesting more frequent reoccupation during that period,
with Yarbrough (n = 18) well represented. Other late dart points recovered include
Edgewood (n = 1), Ellis (n = 6), Ensor (n = 3), Kent (n = 6), and Williams (n = 3). The
remainder of the dart point collection consists of Late Archaic or Woodland period
Gary points (n = 20, 27 percent).
At the Oak Hill Village site in Rusk County, Late Archaic projectile points
again dominate the collection at 53 percent of the typeable dart points. Yarbrough
(n = 58) is prominent. Other types identified are Bulverde (n = 4), Darl (n = 2), Ellis
(n = 11), Kent (n = 14), and Woden (n = 9) (Rogers and Perttula 2004:151–165). An
Early to Middle Archaic component is also present based on the 29 percent of the
typeable points classed as Wells (n = 19), Morrill (n = 7), Carrollton (n = 1), and a
straight-stemmed provisional type (n = 9). In addition, several early types recovered
not common in the area include Cache River (n = 1), Palmer (n = 2), Big Sandy
(n = 1), and Lone Oak (n = 2). The investigators note that the majority of the early
points from Oak Hill Village appear to have been fashioned from nonlocal stones,
while the Late Archaic points appear to be made from local materials (Rogers and
Perttula 2004:151). This difference in material usage supports the conclusion that
the Archaic period saw the gradual establishment of local group territories.
Within the Potters Creek valley north of the Sabine River, excavations at
the Resch site (41HS16) revealed a Late Archaic component marked by mainly Ellis
(n = 45) and Kent (n = 42) dart points but with a strong presence of the Yarbrough
type (n = 15) (Webb et al. 1969:3–106). Fewer Early to Middle Archaic period points
were recovered (n = 26), with Wells (n = 5) and Palmillas (n = 16) points making up
most of the sample. Notable among the Early to Middle Archaic points is a single
specimen typed as a Sinner, which is comparable to the Evans type. The Evans point
is considered to be a temporal diagnostic for the beginning of the Middle Archaic
period in Louisiana (Saunders and Allen 1995:17).
A single Evans point manufactured of probable local chert was recovered
during test excavations at 41RK557 within the Rusk Permit Area V on the south
side of the Sabine River (Dockall and Fields 2011:44–45). This type is primarily

Chapter 2: Archeological Background
distributed in Arkansas and Louisiana, being recorded at Poverty Point, Jaketown,
and Cowpen Slough (Turner and Hester 1985). Schambach (1998:52) suggests that
Evans points have their greatest abundance and distribution in an area of Arkansas
from the Cooper site to the southeast into Cleveland and Lincoln Counties. Ford
and Webb (1956) defined the type based on four specimens from Poverty Point,
but Schambach reports hundreds of specimens from the aforementioned sites in
Arkansas.
Woodland Period: ca. 200 b.c.–ca. a.d. 900
The Woodland period is defined by significant changes in subsistence and
technology. Among these were the inception of horticulture, the introduction of
ceramics, and perhaps longer-term occupation at single sites. Other technological
changes include the first use of the bow and arrow in the region (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:45). The early ceramics include Williams Plain pottery, which are plain
and very thick bowls and flowerpot-shaped jars found in the Sabine, Sulphur, and Red
River drainage basins of northeast Texas (Perttula 2004:376). Sites in the Red River
drainage in southwestern Arkansas and northeastern Texas are often characterized
by abundant ceramics. However, the use of ceramics was not as prevalent in many
Woodland sites in the Sulphur and Sabine River drainages (Perttula 2004:376).
These regional differences could indicate variation in food-processing techniques,
subsistence preferences, and mobility during the period. Other diagnostic artifacts
include double-bitted axes, small thin Gary dart points, and, by the end of the period,
corner-notched arrow points such as Colbert and Friley (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:45–46; Perttula 2004:376; Story 1990:248).
People of this period were still mainly hunter-gatherers. More intensive
occupations are indicated by evidence of structures (postmolds, postholes, and burned
clay daub) and substantial midden deposits at some sites (Perttula 2004:277). Plant
food processing increased in importance as demonstrated by the increased presence
of various ground stone tools. Plant use included the processing of hardwood nuts
as well as the use and encouragement of some native plants such as sumpweed,
Chenopodium, maygrass, knotweed, and sunflower. Tropical cultigens, primarily
squash, were also introduced at this time, but the evidence indicates that Woodland
peoples were still primarily hunter-gatherers rather than farmers (Perttula
2004:377).
Site types consist of residential camps or base camps that may or may not
contain midden deposits, rare mound sites, and occasionally established cemeteries.
Sites can contain a variety of cultural features including pits, postholes, burials,
cremations, burned rock hearths, burned rock scatters, and hearth features without
burned rocks (Perttula et al. 1993:110–111). What the majority of these sites have
in common is the presence of Gary dart points and Williams Plain pottery or other
ceramic types associated with the lower Mississippi River valley (Tchefuncte
Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville Incised, and Marksville Stamped variety
Troyville), although these types usually occur in very low numbers. Evidence from
burial mound sites Coral Snake (McClurkan et al. 1966) on the Sabine River and
Jonas Short in the Angelina River drainage (McClurkan et al. 1980) indicates that

19

20

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
some inhabitants of northeast Texas were participating in far-flung social networks,
but the overall absence of ceremonial centers suggests there were no “social and
political entities linking multiple residential communities in formal ways” (Girard
et al. 2014:35).
The Resch site, the Oak Hill Village site, and 41HS74, discussed above as
examples of Archaic period components near the present project area, also have
Woodland period occupations marked by Gary dart points or early ceramics. Of
the three sites, Resch produced the most Gary points, making up 64 percent of the
typeable points recovered. Gary points are ubiquitous in Late Archaic, Woodland,
and Early Caddo period components in northeast Texas and northwestern Louisiana,
and their frequency at Resch suggests a substantial Woodland period occupation
(Webb et al. 1969:96–99). The Resch site dart point assemblage is complemented
by ceramic sherds representing deep bowls and flowerpot vases characteristic of
Williams Plain (Webb et al. 1969:20–24), along with Tchefuncte (1 vessel and 20
sherds) and Marksville (23 sherds) ceramics. In addition, 135 ground stone items,
consisting of pitted stones, grinding slabs, mullers, mauls, anvils, and hammerstones,
are indicative of the importance of plant processing at this site (Webb et al. 1969:67).
Recently tested 41HS231 just north of the Sabine River also has a notable
Woodland component, although it is mixed with remains from earlier and later
occupations (Dockall et al. 2008:57–96). This radiocarbon-dated component (a.d. 540–
810) is represented by Williams Plain pottery, a single possible Coles Creek Incised
sherd, Gary and perhaps Kent dart points, and perhaps Friley arrow points (Dockall
et al. 2008:145). Friley points along with sherds that probably relate to Williams
Plain, Marksville, and Coles Creek pottery mark a Woodland component at recently
tested 41RK562 in the Rusk Permit Area V south of the river as well (Dockall and
Fields 2011:67–79). Recent data recovery excavations at the Hawkwind site on
Potters Creek north of the Sabine River also recovered a significant collection of
Woodland materials (Ellis et al. 2013). Among these were 77 Gary points, 1 Friley
point, 41 ground stone tools, a few sherds with Marksville-related decorations, and
a suite of radiocarbon dates spanning most of the Woodland period and beyond.
Early Caddo Period: a.d. 900–1200
The Early Caddo period (or Formative [a.d. 900–1050] and Early [a.d. 1050–
1200] Caddo periods, according to the chronology proposed by Girard et al.
[2014:38–41]) in northeast Texas and adjoining areas is best known from sites that
served as ceremonial centers and have mounds and elaborate burials, including the
George C. Davis site in Cherokee County, Texas (Newell and Krieger 1949; Story
1997), Crenshaw in Miller County, Arkansas (Schambach 1982), and Gahagan
(Webb and Dodd 1939) and Mounds Plantation (Webb and McKinney 1975) in Red
River and Caddo Parishes, Louisiana. Characteristic ceramic types are Holly Fine
Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches Fingernail
Impressed, Coles Creek Incised and related types, Crockett Curvilinear Incised,
Pennington Punctated-Incised, Canton Incised, and Dunkin Incised (Gadus et al.
2006:20; Thurmond 1981:435). Diagnostic arrow point styles are Alba, Bonham,
Friley, Scallorn, and Catahoula (Gadus et al. 2006:20; Thurmond 1981:436).

Chapter 2: Archeological Background
As summarized by Perttula (1996:302), the key aspects of the development of
the Caddo cultural tradition are: (1) development and elaboration of complex social
relationships and political authority; (2) appearance of elite status positions in Caddo
communities; (3) increased sedentism; and (4) continued and enhanced reliance on
tropical cultigens and intensification of maize agriculture after a.d. 1200. Early
Caddo developments probably did not include true agriculture. Rather, subsistence
patterns of hunting and gathering augmented by horticulture developed during
the Archaic and Woodland periods probably continued (Fritz 1993:56). There was
an apparent increased reliance on plant foods that resulted in greater population
aggregations at mound centers. These aggregate populations provided surplus
labor to support the expanding ritual, political, social, and economic infrastructure
necessary for elite leaders to manage and control various resources.
Because the development of the Caddo culture was a local phenomenon, albeit
related to developments across the midwestern and southeastern United States, and
the Caddo Area Was ecologically diverse, there appears to have been substantial
cultural variation among Early Caddo groups. Story (1990:323) summarizes this
variation by hypothesizing that there were at least four Caddoan subtraditions (i.e.,
Arkansas Valley, Red River, Woodland Edge, and Piney Woods), and she speculatively
places sites in the middle Sabine basin within the Piney Woods subtradition.
In the middle Sabine basin surrounding the current project area, the Early
Caddo period is not well understood because of the paucity of excavated sites of this
age. Nonetheless, it is surmised that the region was occupied with some intensity,
based on the presence of the Early Caddo mound center at the Hudnall-Pirtle site on
a low terrace near the Sabine River in northern Rusk County (Bruseth 1991). This
site is a large (1,100x400 m) civic and ceremonial center, apparently dating mostly
to a.d. 1000–1200, that contains eight constructed mounds, three borrow pits, a
plaza, and residential areas. The work done there has yielded a sizeable collection of
artifacts, with the ceramics including sherds similar to Davis Incised, Kiam Incised,
Dunkin Incised, Weches Fingernail Impressed, Pennington Punctated-Incised,
Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Holly Fine
Engraved, and Coles Creek Incised (Bruseth and Perttula 2006:82–95). Projectile
point types include Catahoula, Friley, Scallorn, Homan, Colbert, Alba, Steiner, and
Kent (Bruseth and Perttula 2006:100–107).
Early Caddo habitation sites also occur in the middle Sabine, indicating
that some of the population was dispersed across the landscape. Near the current
project area, Resch, Oak Hill Village, and 41HS74 all have Early Caddo materials
and probably exemplify habitation sites. At none of these sites are the Early Caddo
components the primary ones, however, and thus it is hard to get a clear picture of
what typical habitations looked like.
Middle and Late Caddo Periods: a.d. 1200–1680
With increased reliance on maize agriculture after a.d. 1200, Caddo groups
occupied all major drainage basins in northeast Texas and adjoining regions. By the
Late Caddo period, these communities were represented by the Texarkana phase

21

22

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
on the Great Bend of the Red River, the McCurtain phase on the Red above the
Great Bend, the Belcher phase on the Red below the Great Bend, the Titus phase in
the Cypress Creek basin and on the upper and middle Sabine, the Angelina phase
downstream in the Sabine basin and westward into the Angelina River valley, and
the Frankston phase in the upper Neches and Angelina drainages (Girard et al.
2014:65–68; Perttula 1992:90). The ceramic types made and used by these groups
are too varied and numerous to list here, but the diagnostic arrow point styles are
more consistent, including Perdiz, Talco, Bassett, Maud, Turney, and Fresno (Fields
et al. 1997:90; Gadus et al. 2006:21; Thurmond 1990:232).
Along with variability in architecture, settlement configuration (including
mound building), and mortuary practices, the proliferation of ceramic styles
across the region reflects increased expression of social identities, with these
differences marking “zones where social interactions, perhaps including population
movements, trade, kinship connections, and other social alliances, were particularly
strong” (Girard et al. 2014:68–69). These Caddo were settled farmers. Many lived
in farmsteads and dispersed rural communities, but others occupied town-like
communities, particularly along the major rivers. Special-purpose buildings,
i.e., temples and the residences of political and religious leaders, were often
associated with the construction of earthen mounds, emphasizing the importance
of “public building-oriented ceremonialism” rather than the “individual-oriented
ceremonialism” that characterized the Early Caddo period (Girard et al. 2014:77;
Schambach 1996:40).
There is ample evidence for intensive use of the middle Sabine basin during
the Middle and Late Caddo periods. The extensively excavated Oak Hill Village site,
occupied primarily between a.d. 1150 and 1450, yielded evidence of more than 40
structures associated with five building episodes (Rogers and Perttula 2004:49). A
variety of pit and hearth features were also identified within the village area both
inside and outside the structures. Of 84 small pits excavated, 32 produced corn and
provide an indication of the ubiquity of this cultigen at the site (Rogers and Perttula
2004:97–107). In their discussion of the regional context for Oak Hill Village, Rogers
and Perttula (2004:23–26) include five comparable large habitation sites or villages
along the Sabine and its tributaries at the intersection of Rusk, Panola, and Harrison
Counties. These villages cover 3 to 8 acres and usually include a communal midden
and small cemetery or mound.
Recent work in Harrison County on the north side of the Sabine River has
identified numerous sites constituting the Pine Tree Mound community, which
was occupied from a.d. 1300 to perhaps the mid 1600s (Dockall et al. 2008; Fields
and Gadus 2012; Gadus et al. 2006; Wilder et al. 2007). The focal point of this
community was the Pine Tree Mound site, a ceremonial center with at least three
earthen mounds that once supported structures, areas with off-mound structures,
a plaza, and at least one high-status cemetery. Residential areas surround the core
ceremonial area and are scattered down Potters Creek and across adjacent stream
valleys. These village areas appear to have to contained only a house or two at any
one time, with many houses having been rebuilt several times. The village areas
also contain small cemeteries. Fields and Gadus (2012) suggest that the Pine Tree

Chapter 2: Archeological Background
Mound community equates to the home territory of the Nadaco, or Nondacao, Caddo,
who were documented in this part of the Sabine basin as early as a.d. 1542 and as
late as 1788.
Historic Caddo Period: a.d. 1680–1860
At the time of historic contact, the Caddo people included some 25 closely
affiliated groups settled along the Great Bend of the Red River extending into the
Piney Woods region of northeast Texas. Europeans had first entered northeast
Texas in a.d. 1542 as part of the De Soto entrada. The entrada probably followed an
ancient trail known as Hasinai Trace, later Trammel’s Trace, that passed through
the eastern part of the Rusk Permit area (Dockall et al. 2010; Fields 2008; Fields
and Gadus 2012:641; Gadus et al. 2006:133; Perttula et al. 1986:184; Wedel 1978:3).
Caddo groups that the Spanish explorers encountered as they traversed the Sulphur
River, Cypress Creek, and middle Sabine River drainages include the Nissohone,
Lacane, and Nondacao (Perttula 1992:21).
The few village and cemetery sites with European trade goods that are
known to occur in the middle Sabine area, dating mostly to the eighteenth century
and thus long after the entrada, are near Trammel’s Trace and have been given the
appellation Kinsloe phase (Jones 1968). Fields and Gadus (2012) suggest that at
least some of the Kinsloe sites could have been occupied by descendants of the Pine
Tree Mound community, perhaps augmented by other immigrant Caddo groups, but
the people who created these sites eventually may have become part of the Hasinai
confederacy, which was focused to the south along the upper Neches and Angelina
Rivers (Perttula 1992:166–177). This confederacy, along with the Kadohadacho
confederacy near the Great Bend of the Red River, were amalgamations of remnant
Caddo groups that began to form ca. a.d. 1700. These confederacies were successful
for a time in taking advantage of the Spanish and French contention for control of
east Texas. But they, too, continued to contract in population size and area occupied
due to the pressures of disease and competition for traditional resources with other
displaced Native American groups. This competition was exacerbated when EuroAmericans began to settle east Texas. By 1834, the Caddo relinquished their rights to
territory within the United States and, pushed from their traditional homeland, by
1860 were residing in Indian Territory, later to become part of Oklahoma (Swanton
1942:89–113).

CHAPTER 3: METHODS OF INVESTIGATION

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
From April to August 2014, a five-person crew from Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., conducted National Register of Historic Places eligibility testing at seven
prehistoric sites in Rusk County, Texas. The sites—41RK674, 41RK680, 41RK693,
41RK695, 41RK703, 41RK704, and 41RK729—will be impacted by mining-related
activities in North American Coal Corporation–Sabine Mine’s South Hallsville
No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W. These sites were recorded in 2012 by Prewitt and
Associates (Dockall et al. 2014) and were recommended as needing further work
for eligibility assessments.
Based on survey data, 41RK674 and 41RK693 appeared to be artifact
scatters where Caddo ceramics substantially outnumber lithics. Although midden
deposits were not identified at either, they appeared to represent Caddo occupations
associated with the nearby mound centers at the Hudnall-Pirtle, Lane Mitchell, or
Pine Tree Mound sites (4, 9, and 19 km to the northeast). Sites such as these would
have functioned within settlement systems consisting of a number of site types,
including multifamily villages, smaller residential hamlets, campsites, and resource
procurement and processing areas. If interpretable components could be isolated,
these sites would contribute to a better understanding of those settlement systems.
Their locations on the valley wall would have provided views of the floodplain to
the north and access to a variety of environmental niches such as upland forest,
floodplains, streams, and relatively level land for agricultural pursuits; hence,
their setting suggested they served as small residential sites, or perhaps campsites
associated with resource procurement or processing.
Site 41RK695 was the only Area W site in the uplands proper that had
a chance of having an interpretable Caddo component. Although the recovered
assemblage was small, it included five plain prehistoric ceramic sherds, which
might indicate an Early Caddo component connected to the Hudnall-Pirtle site. Like
41RK674 and 41RK693 above, it was viewed as having the potential to contribute to
a better understanding of Caddo settlement systems. Its setting and the low artifact
density suggested that it might be a campsite related to resource procurement or
processing activities.
The other four sites—41RK680, 41RK703, 41RK704, and 41RK729—are on
elevated rises on the floodplain of Cherokee Bayou. No instances of archeological
remains within stratified Holocene alluvium were observed in shovel tests at these

25

26

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
sites, but it was considered possible that such contexts could be present and, if
so, that it might be comparatively easy to isolate components in some areas. Two
sites (41RK680 and 41RK729) yielded small numbers of Caddo sherds, and a third
(41RK704) had an untypeable arrow point indicating it probably also has a Caddo
component. Site 41RK703 did not have any temporally diagnostic artifacts, but given
the setting and the findings at the other sites, it was considered likely to also have
Caddo materials. Hence, like 41RK674, 41RK693, and 41RK695 discussed above,
these sites appeared to have the potential to contribute to a better understanding
of Caddo settlement systems, particularly that associated with the Early Caddo
ceremonial center at the Hudnall-Pirtle site on the Sabine River just 2.9–5.2 km to
the northeast. The setting of these sites, i.e., on low floodplain rises, suggested they
were not suitable for year-round occupation, and the generally low artifact densities
at all but 41RK704 were consistent with this interpretation. Hence, these sites
may have been used as short-term campsites or procurement/processing locations
associated with exploitation of the surrounding floodplain.
The approach to testing these sites was based on the one used successfully
by Prewitt and Associates elsewhere in the Sabine Mine (Dockall and Fields 2011;
Dockall et al. 2008; Gadus et al. 2006). This approach begins with mechanical
trenching to identify areas where subsurface disturbance is limited; to identify areas
where cultural features are, or are likely to be, preserved based on the character
and thickness of the sediments; and to determine where features such as middens
are present. Trenching is followed by controlled manual excavations using 1x1-m
test units in areas with artifacts or cultural features, or with the potential for
preserved cultural features, to determine the contents of the sites and the densities,
distributions, and degree of integrity of the archeological remains. At the larger
sites (41RK674, 41RK680, and 41RK703), test excavations were limited to those
areas where shovel testing during survey showed that artifacts are most frequent;
this was done to avoid spending time testing areas with uninterpretable, sparse
artifact scatters. One of these sites (41RK680) straddles the disturbance boundary
for the mine, and the area outside that boundary to the north was not tested because
mining will not impact it.
Table 3.1 shows the amount of excavation done at each site. At four sites
(41RK674, 41RK680, 41RK693, and 41RK695), the intensity of investigation via test
units was comparable, at one unit per 156–194 m2. Variations from this pattern are
due mostly to differences in the sizes of the areas investigated, with the smallest
site, 41RK704, tested more intensively (one unit per 92 m2), and the largest site,
41RK703, tested less intensively (one unit per 1,060 m2). Site 41RK729 also saw
less intensive testing (one unit per 385 m2) because of its larger size and the fact
that the cultural materials there turned out to be especially sparse (i.e., there was
not much to investigate). The intensity of testing via trenches was comparable for
41RK674, 41RK680, 41RK695, and 41RK704 at 14–30 m2 of site area per square
meter of trench. Trenching was less intensive at 41RK693 and 41RK729 (61 and
110 m2 per square meter of trench) because they are heavily wooded and hard to
access with a backhoe. Trenching was least intensive (117 m2 per square meter of
trench) at 41RK703 because it is by far the largest site.

Field Methods
Trenching was done with a backhoe with a telescoping arm and smoothbladed bucket. The trenches were excavated to the Bt horizon when possible, but
some were terminated at the water table or a maximum depth of 130 cm below
surface so that the crew could safely document the sediments. Intermediate stops
were made above the base of the excavation to inspect for cultural features. Trench
sediments were not screened, but artifacts observed in the trenches and backdirt
were collected. The walls of the trenches were shovel scraped and troweled to see if
features were preserved. Trench profiles were documented with photographs and
schematic profile drawings and descriptions.
Manual excavations were carried out using 1x1-m units, sometimes placed
off the sides of trenches and sometimes apart from trenches. Units were excavated
in 10-cm levels, and the fill from all unit levels was dry screened through 1/4-inchmesh hardware cloth. Test unit depth depended on the thickness of the sands at
each location, averaging 87 cm. Vertical control was maintained by establishing
unit-specific datum stakes set at the ground surface. Unit and trench locations
were recorded with a Trimble GeoXH GPS. Potential cultural features discovered in
trenches and test units were cleaned, mapped, and photographed in plan view and
cross section. Flotation samples were collected from the features, and any remaining
feature fill was dry screened through 1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth. Feature locations
were mapped in relation to the trench or unit in which they were discovered.
Standard forms were used for recording information about backhoe trenches,
test units, and features; these notes were made by the project archeologist or
individual crew members involved in their excavation. Trench forms recorded
trench number, orientation, maximum length, and depth, as well as notes on the
sediments encountered and cultural materials collected. Test unit forms recorded
unit number, starting and ending depths below unit datum, recovery by level, and
a description of the sediments, disturbances, and features encountered. A level plan
was drawn only if features or significant disturbances were encountered. Feature
forms recorded dimensions, depth to point of recognition and to the bottom of the
feature, a description of the fill, feature contents, and a plan and cross section. Other
site documentation included the project archeologist’s journal and the photographic

27

28

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
record of all features, excavations, and site overviews. A digital camera was used
for all photographic documentation.
LABORATORY METHODS
The materials recovered from the tested sites were returned biweekly to the
Prewitt and Associates laboratory in Austin, Texas, for processing. Artifacts were
washed and labeled with the site number and a lot number indicat­ing provenience.
All lithic specimens identified as tools were given a lot-specific specimen number
to aid in their analysis. Other remains such as charcoal, charred nutshells, faunal
materials, burned clay, burned rocks, and unmodified rocks were cleaned and then
counted or weighed by provenience. Each artifact or item class was recorded in a
specimen inventory catalog.
Flotation samples were processed in the laboratory using a Flote-Tech
Flotation System. After processing, fine-screen fractions from the flotation samples
were sorted, mainly for macrobotanical and faunal recovery. As a means of achieving
a representative sample in a timely fashion, each fine-screen fraction was sorted
for a maximum of a half hour.
All artifacts, field journals, artifact inven­tories, trench notes, test unit notes,
feature notes, site maps, profile drawings, sediment descriptions, analysis notes, and
photographs generated dur­ing the project are curated at the Texas Archeo­logical
Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.
LITHIC ANALYSIS METHODS
In keeping with previous Prewitt and Associates projects at the Sabine Mine,
the methods and techniques of lithic artifact analysis employed by Gadus et al.
(2006) and Dockall et al. (2008, 2011) were applied with appropriate updates and
changes in data collection protocols. As with these earlier studies, the analysis of
lithic assemblages included attributes selected to examine aspects of raw material
use, tool technology and morphology, and core reduction strategies.
The theoretical approach applied in this study is that of technological
organization (Amick and Carr 1996; Carr 2008; Carr et al. 2012). Studies of lithic
technological organization address technical aspects of raw material procurement,
production, tool use, and tool discard patterns (Carr 2008:215–219). Technological
organization entails the techniques and methods a group uses to design its tools
to perform efficiently in meeting basic daily needs. The group must consider the
types of raw materials available, the distance and location(s) of suitable material,
techniques for getting and processing food, distribution and abundance of food and
nonfood resources, group mobility patterns, and interactions and relations with
other social groups (Koldehoff 1987:154; Nelson 1991:57).
The format for lithic analysis used in this study includes observations on
raw material type, technological attributes (stylistic and manufacture related),
functional information, typological assessments, and patterns of tool use, breakage,
repair, and discard. Debitage analysis incorporates mass debris analysis (Ahler

Chapter 3: Methods of Investigation
1989) and flake typology (Odell 2004) and technological interpretation of the results
(Odell 2004:121–129).
Caddo lithic technology is often characterized as having a generalized corereduction strategy, which may have been due, in large part, to increased sedentism
(Dockall et al. 2008, 2011; Johnson 1986; Parry and Kelly 1987; Shafer 1973; Teltser
1991). Across the region, there were systematic ways of overcoming lithic resource
limitations presented by spotty access, low abundance, small size, and poor quality.
Techniques of flaking small nodule/pebble materials, such as bipolar flaking and
indirect percussion, are known for northeast Texas and beyond (Brewington et al.
1995; Dockall et al. 2008, 2011; Shafer 1973; Studer 1982). Studies of generalized
core reduction by Teltser (1991), Johnson (1986), and Cobb and Webb (1994) all
emphasize that such reduction strategies were commonly employed to conserve
limited amounts of available nonlocal raw materials and artifacts manufactured
of these materials. Parry and Kelly (1987) argue for a technological association
between such techniques and material curation and increasing sedentism. Three
aspects of generalized core reduction defined by Parry and Kelly (1987:287) appear
to fit quite well with what is currently known for the bulk of Caddo lithic technology.
Briefly, these are: (1) core flaking techniques were not designed to provide flakes of
a specific morphology, i.e., there was no deliberate core preparation; (2) there was no
apparent distinction at the time of knapping between tools and waste, with debris
best suited to the task being chosen for use; and (3) very few of the selected pieces
of debris destined for tool use were modified prior to use, except for specialized tools
like bifaces, knives, and projectile points.
The Geological Environment for Lithic Procurement
Rusk County is dominated by Tertiary Eocene deposits, with Quaternary
Holocene and Pleistocene alluvial and terrace deposits along the larger streams and
rivers. The Eocene deposits are dominated by formations included in the Claiborne
Group: Sparta Sand, Weches Formation, Queen City Sand, Reklaw Formation, and
Carrizo Sand (Sandeen 1987). The uppermost segment of the Wilcox Group also
has been included as part of the initial Tertiary rock sequence in the county and
underlies the Claiborne Group. In terms of materials usable to make stone tools,
these formations would have been good sources for sandstone, limonite, hematite,
fluvial gravels, and some limestone. The Quaternary deposits are sources of usable
gravels, which are a mix of different lithologies inclusive of silicified wood, chert,
quartzite, sandstone, and occasional massive quartz pebbles and smaller cobbles.
Other suitable materials had to be procured directly from distant sources
or via exchange, either as raw materials or more commonly finished artifacts.
Previous analyses have shown that the procurement universe for lithic materials
in the region extended to include portions of central Texas, the Red River valley,
the Ozarks, and the Ouachita Mountains. People in the area also participated at
some level within broader exchange networks that functioned within the lower
Mississippi valley and greater southeastern United States. The array of nonlocal
materials identified in small numbers at sites in northeast Texas includes Boone
(Keokuk) chert, novaculite, Edwards cherts, Woodford chert, Big Fork cherts, Frisco

29

30

chert, Manning fused glass, Pisgah Ridge chert, Cotter dolomite, Elsey chert, and
basalt/basalt porphyry (Banks 1984, 1990; McFarland 2004; McGregor 1993; Perttula
1984; Thompson and Fellows 1969).
Raw Materials
Raw material type was recorded for all chipped and ground stone artifacts.
Stone categories consist of coarse- and fine-grained cherts, silicified wood, quartzite,
ferruginous sandstone, hematite or ocher, and other similar materials. Principle
sources for identification and understanding of the rock and mineral resources of
northeast Texas and adjacent areas include Shafer (1973), Banks (1984, 1990), Studer
(1982), Perttula (1984), and Fisher (1965). Additional sources of lithic identification
are McFarland (2004) and Thompson and Fellows (1969). Banks (1990), Perttula
(1984), and Shafer (1973) provide a regional perspective on the distribution and
prehistoric use of lithic materials in east and northeast Texas.
By far, most of the lithic materials from previously tested sites in the Sabine
Mine area are of local origin (Dockall and Fields 2011; Dockall et al. 2008, 2010;
Gadus et al. 2006; Studer 1982). At a series of sites on Starkey Creek, Gadus et al.
(2006) found that just 2–6 percent of the unmodified chipped stone debitage is of
nonlocal and probable nonlocal materials; the assemblages consist predominantly
of local quartzite (22–50 percent), fine-grained chert (24–35 percent), and silicified
wood (12–27 percent). At 41HS231 and 41HS588 on the north wall of the Sabine
River valley, Dockall et al. (2008:81–82) noted that local lithic materials make up
94–96 percent of the debitage with 62–65 percent being local gravel cherts and
quartzite and 21–22 percent being silicified wood. At the extensively excavated
mainly Late Caddo Pine Tree Mound site on Potters Creek north of the Sabine,
92 percent of the debitage and 87 percent of the chipped stone tools were of materials
that could have been procured locally (Fields and Gadus 2012:605). At three tested
sites on the south side of the Sabine River in Rusk County (41RK557, 41RK558,
and 41RK562), 91–97 percent of the debitage was of local cherts, quartzites, and
silicified wood (Dockall and Fields 2011).
In a detailed study of the Icy Eye site (41HS46) and vicinity near Pine Tree
Mound, the majority of the lithic materials identified by Studer (1982:25–27) were
attributed to fluvial gravels of the Wilcox Formation or gravel deposits associated
with the Sabine River. Materials from two nonarcheological sample locations
consisted of 32–37 percent chert, 46–51 percent quartzite, and 11–23 percent silicified
wood. Chert and quartzite made up 47 and 51 percent of the 41HS46 assemblage,
reasonably comparable to the sample collections. Silicified wood constituted only
2 percent, suggesting that raw material selection patterns at the site did not favor
this material.
Tool Attributes
Projectile Points
Projectile points were subdivided into arrow points and dart points. Where
possible, formal type names following Turner and Hester (1985) and other sources

Chapter 3: Methods of Investigation
are employed. Projectile points were coded as to completeness, manufacture
stage, fragment type or portion, failure or discard cause, raw material, and type of
secondary alteration. Secondary alterations could include thermal damage (other
than deliberate heat treatment), patina, oxide stains, pigment stains, carbonates,
and deliberate heat treatment. Metric attributes (recorded in mm) include maximum
length, maximum width, maximum thickness, left and right blade lengths, stem
length, stem width, neck thickness, neck width, and weight (in grams). Portions
include distal, distal-medial, medial, proximal-medial, proximal, lateral edge(s)
missing, barb/shoulder, ear/tang, stem, tip missing, lateral edge fragment, and other
fragments. Failure or discard categories include snap/end shock, impact/bending,
perverse, hinge/step, overshot, material flaw, platform loss, excessive heating,
multiple fractures, radial break, snap break, radial/snap break, resharpening, edge
collapse, and indeterminate.
Non-Projectile Point Bifaces
A variety of bifacial implements such as knives, perforators, and drills have
defined forms and characteristic patterns of use and constitute types of formal tools.
All bifacial tool identifications are based on Turner and Hester (1985) and assessment
of manufacture stages as indicated by technological attributes. All bifaces were coded
for raw material, completeness, portion, secondary alterations, fragment type, and
causes of breakage or discard similar to projectile points. Stages of manufacture
include initial reduction, early and later stage forming, finished product, recycled,
rejuvenated/resharpened, resharpening/repair byproduct, or indeterminate. Where
possible, complete and fragmentary bifaces were assigned to one of four heuristic
technological stages, Stages 1 through 4 based on Whittaker (1994:177–212).
These are based on changing technological and morphological characteristics of
the artifact. Stage 1 represents the initial reduction and shaping of the tool from
either a flake or other material mass. Outline shape is irregular, and cortex may
be present on one or both faces of the artifact. Hard-hammer percussion flaking is
characteristic of Stage 1 bifaces. Stage 2 bifaces exhibit a more characteristic outline
and cross-section morphology from additional flaking and often have no surface
cortex remaining. Bifaces of this stage have been refined in shape and thickness
by additional controlled hard- or soft-hammer percussion or a combination of these
techniques. Stage 3 bifaces show further development of the final shape and size
of the intended artifact and may exhibit additional trimming and shaping by softhammer percussion and pressure flaking. Stage 4 bifaces are those that are judged
to have reached the end stage of manufacture in terms of shape, size, and attributes
such as notching, edge serrating, edge or basal grinding, and haft elements. Metric
observations for bifaces include maximum length, maximum width, maximum
thickness, and weight.
Unifaces
A common observation of Caddo lithic assemblages is the scarcity of formal
unifacial artifacts and retouched flake tools (Dockall 1995; Dockall and Fields
2011; Dockall et al. 2008; Girard 1982; Kay 1984; Shafer 1973). Unifacial tools

31

32

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
are flake tools with moderate to substantial modification to the working edges,
with the retouch restricted to one face of the parent flake or chunk. A few may
sometimes exhibit minimal bifacial shaping or flaking along the working edge from
resharpening. These implements are commonly assigned to categories based on the
location and sometimes the type of retouch along the working edge, for example,
end scraper, side scraper, and end/side scraper. Raw material, manufacture stage,
portion or fragment, breakage or discard, and alteration were noted. Maximum
length, maximum width, maximum thickness, and weight were also recorded.
Edge-Modified Flakes
Edge-modified flakes do not appear to have any deliberate shaping or retouch
on any edge or surface and exhibit only modification that is probably due to their
use as tools for various tasks. Tool type, completeness, raw material, portion, failure
or discard cause, alteration, and metric measurements were recorded. All functional
assessments are based on interpretations of microscopic and macroscopic use wear.
A variety of edge-modified tool types are possible, some being functionally
identical to more-formal unifacial tool types. Others are more commonly minimally
modified if at all and may include gravers, perforators, burins, and radial and snap
break tools. Identification of specific types of edge-modified flake tools is based
primarily on the location and morphology of the functional edge(s) and characteristics
of use wear. Wear patterns for various tool motions and inferred functions are based
on research conducted by Tringham et al. (1974), Odell and Odell-Vereecken (1980),
and Odell (1981).
Cobble Tools
This category includes large pebbles and small cobbles with bifacially or
unifacially flaked edges. These tools are distinguished from cores by the presence
of use wear along the chipped edges. Often, they were employed in tasks requiring
tool mass and a durable edge, such as chopping or scraping hard materials. Cobble
tools may occasionally be reused cores or fragments of ground stone implements
that were recycled and repurposed with little or no additional modification except for
percussion retouch of an edge. Raw material, technological observations, and metric
dimensions and weight were collected as per other chipped stone tool categories.
Unmodified Debitage and Core Attributes
Debitage
Unmodified debitage was subjected to a two-step analysis involving size
grading and flake typology. Size grade or mass analysis (Ahler 1989) provides a
quick and reliable method of acquiring dimensional data that can be useful in
comparisons between sites. The categories used are: Size Grade 1, 19.0–25.0 mm;
Size Grade 2, 12.5–19.0 mm; Size Grade 3, 9.5–12.5 mm; Size Grade 4, 6.3–9.5 mm;
and Size Grade 5, <6.3 mm. Size grade analysis focuses on the collection and study
of size distribution data and basic flake shape information (Ahler 1989:25). It is
an efficient means of deriving behavioral and technological information from both

Chapter 3: Methods of Investigation
large and small samples of flaking debris and has been applied to other Caddo and
non-Caddo sites in the Sabine Mine area (Dockall et al. 2008, 2011; Dockall and
Fields 2011).
Debitage was also sorted by raw material and flake type (Table 3.2).
Flake type assignments represent qualitative evaluations of flake origin based on
morphology and technological attributes. In addition, an experimental flake type
collection was used for comparison. The basis for the technological states comes
from lithic analyses conducted by Girard (1982), Shafer (1973), Studer (1982), and
Dockall (Dockall 1995; Dockall et al. 2008; Dockall and Fields 2011), among others.
Each potential flake type contains information that identifies the specific technique
used to produce it or the stage of the manufacture process at which it was created
(Odell 2004:121). Complete and proximal portions of flakes were included in flake
determinations. Medial and distal fragments and shatter were dealt with separately.
Four additional observations were made for each flake type: the presence of
cortex, burning, heat treatment, and the total weight of flakes in each group. Because
the bulk of the lithic assemblage reflects the procurement and use of pebble-size
materials, cortex was recorded as a presence or absence variable rather than a
percentage estimate. The small size of the raw materials indicates that there will be
a higher representation of cortex among all stages of reduction, and hence estimates
of stage of manufacture based on cortex would be of questionable interpretive value.
Cores
Cores include all angular lithic chunks with evidence of single or multiple
flake removals. Core types included in the analysis are cobble/pebble, partial cobble/
pebble, noncortical, noncortical fragment, large flake, bipolar, tested material, blade
and microblade, bifacial or discoid, and angular mass of material that could not be
determined. Potential core flake removal patterns are unidirectional, bidirectional,
multidirectional, radial/centripetal, and indeterminate. Flake removal patterns are
modal and based on the most common pattern visible on the core face(s). In most
instances, the flake removal pattern(s) appear related to the number of striking
platforms and core reduction intensity.
Previous analyses of Caddo core reduction have indicated that the techniques
of flake production for tools were intimately tied to the mode of raw material
occurrence and resource abundance. Shafer (1973), Studer (1982), and Dockall
(Dockall 1995; Dockall et al. 2008; Dockall and Fields 2011) have demonstrated
the importance of the bipolar technique for exploiting small pebble and cobble raw
materials, but larger percussion cores were also employed to produce flakes for
tools. The studies indicate that the vast majority of these cores represent the use of
locally available raw materials. Caddo core technology was associated predominantly
with freehand hard-hammer percussion and bipolar techniques (see also Girard
1982:332–333; Shafer 1973:158).
Unidirectional cores have a single striking platform and one direction of
flake removal. Bidirectional cores have two directions of flake removal and at least
two striking platforms. Multidirectional cores have multiple striking platforms and

Table 3.2. Potential flake types and identifying technological attributes
Flake Type

Key Attributes

Bending initiation
(soft hammer or biface
thinning)

No or diffuse bulb of percussion. Distinct lip or ridge on the ventral aspect or
edge of the striking platform. May have a waisted or constricted appearance
just below striking platform. Profile shape typically arched, and plan view often
expands distally. Crushed or collapsed platforms may be present. Abraded,
faceted, or multifaceted platforms are common.

Conchoidal initiation
(hard hammer)

Typically has exuberant or pronounced bulb of percussion and thickened
cross section. Flake shape is variable and often dependent on core surface
morphology.

Wedging initiation (bipolar)

No bulb of percussion or only a sheared bulb. Ripple marks and crushed
and sheared faces on opposed ends of fracture surface indicating force from
opposing directions. Can be associated with abundant nondiagnostic shatter.

Notching

Can be produced by pressure or punch techniques. Flakes typically
C- or S-shaped with previous similarly shaped dorsal flake scars where
removed in sequence. Platforms typically single faceted (Titmus 1985; Weber
1994:635). Notching flakes expand laterally and ventrally like the Hertzian
cone.

Punch

Similar striking platform morphology as notching flakes but variable
flake morphology. When viewed from above onto the striking platform, has
pronounced gull-wing appearance. Typically a noticeable lip is below the
striking platform ventral edge and the top of the bulb of percussion. Exuberant
bulb of percussion or corresponding deep negative bulbar scar on biface.

Pressure

Typically displays laminar or elongate tonguelike shapes with small contact
platform area. Some are constricted below striking platform because platform
was isolated by pressure flaking before flake removal (Whittaker 1994:147).
Common very small bulbs of percussion produced during static loading.
Crushed platforms and broken flakes are common due to thinness.

Outrepassé or overshot

Can be either bending or conchoidal initiated but preserves remnant of
opposing lateral edge(s) of the biface. Distal end terminates in removal of a
portion of the opposing biface edge or in a feather or hinge well onto the surface
of the biface. Often has arched profile in cross section following contour of the
biface surface. Usually created by use of excessive force in flaking and generally
associated with biface manufacture.

Biface edge collapse

Both faces of biface lateral edge are preserved on the proximal end as the
striking platform. Would create corresponding open C shape along the edge
of the biface. Produced as a result of manufacturing error. Termination
morphology is variable (Masson 1998:686).

Biface/tool edge resharpening Flakes typically small (<20 mm) and vary in shape from parallel edged to
slightly expanding with fewer than three dorsal flake scars. Shape may be
influenced by biface or tool surface topography. Can be either Hertzian or
bending initiation and appear as small biface-thinning flakes in shape. May be
representative of late-stage biface shaping/finishing or flake tool retouch.
Uniface or tool edge retouch

Flakes variable depending on detachment technique. On some, striking
platform is rounded, stepped, or crushed from use wear. Common use wear
on dorsal surface, trailing distally from striking platform. Retouch technique
dictates presence or absence of bulb of percussion. Previous dorsal flake scars
can be common and represent previous edge retouch removals. Retouch flakes
have arched profile. Can expand distally or have mostly parallel lateral edges.
In profile, distal termination is curved (Andrefsky 1998:120). On others, flake
resembles small microblade or burin spall in form and size and may have been
produced by a burin retouch technique. On these flakes, one edge of the retouch
flake retains a portion or much of the uniface edge and have a triangular cross
section. Other various uniface retouch flakes described by Shafer (1970).

Blade

Long, thin flake. Commonly, length at least two times greater than width and
roughly parallel sided.

Microblade

Similar to blade but smaller.

Chapter 3: Methods of Investigation
Table 3.2, continued
Flake Type

Key Attributes

Burin spall

Variable depending on parent piece. Generally appear like small blades
or microblades with trihedral, trapezoidal, or rectangular cross sections.
Can display overlap with flakes produced by uniface or tool edge retouch
techniques. Terminations usually step or hinge. Depending on parent piece,
edge of burin spall can retain unmodified lateral edge of flake, bifacial edge of
either projectile point or small biface, or previous burin spall removal scars.
Striking platform varies from flat to faceted and occasionally ground or abraded
with small contact area.

Hoe/adze/celt

Origins and morphology variable. Distinguishing characteristic is presence of
dorsal surface polish indicating removal from item such as hoe, adze, or celt
(Odell 2004:121).

Core platform rejuvenation

Flakes removed from core platforms or surfaces to rejuvenate or repair the core
for continued flaking. Commonly removed from unidirectional flake and blade
cores. Disk-shaped flakes with remnant flake removal scars around the lateral
edge (portion or all) also fall into this category.

Hammerstone spall

Dorsal surface heavily battered with flake scar ridges. Typically of limestone or
quartz and quartzite with no evidence of burning to suggest thermal spall.

Shatter/angular and thermal

Includes fragments, chunks, and chips that cannot be assigned to a particular
flake type or identified as flake fragment. Retains no identifying technological
features. Specimens with evidence of burning or heat alteration (thermal) are
distinguished from those without (angular).

Flake fragment

Includes portions identified as fragments. Usually does not include proximal
fragments. Includes lateral edge remnants and medial, distal, and wedgeshaped fragments.

Nodule fragment

Fragments of nodules of materials similar to those used to manufacture
chipped stone tools but exhibit no indications of thermal fracture or features
associated with core reduction or tool use. May be cultural, but technological
origins are unclear. Distinct from shatter/debitage, hammerstone spalls, and
bipolar debris.

directions of flake removal and are typically farther along in the reduction process
than unidirectional and bidirectional cores. Reduction intensity of any of these core
types is relative to the initial mass and size of the raw material. Bipolar cores are
a separate matter because of the technique used to produce flakes. Where local raw
materials occur in the form of small pebbles and cobbles, bipolar flaking or nodule
smashing can be expected (Shafer 1973:65). These cores are usually produced by
orienting the long axis of the pebble on an anvil of hard stone and hitting the top
of the nodule with a hammerstone. With care, such cores can be rotated and struck
multiple times prior to becoming too small for flaking or before failure; thus, they
can be difficult to identify and segregate from shatter. No attempts were made to
identify the number of times a bipolar core had been rotated during flaking or the
number of striking platforms. Based on general observations, most of these cores
were rotated at least once and have multiple areas of impact, suggesting more than
one attempt to remove flakes.
Ground and Battered Stone Artifacts
Ground and battered stone artifacts were classified into the following
categories: mano, pitted stone, hammerstone, slab, anvil, pigment source, polished

35

36

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
stone, grooved stone, axe, celt, and indeterminate. Also included under this heading
in Chapter 4, though technically not belonging there, are manuports, i.e., clearly
introduced pebbles and cobbles that show no evidence of modification.
Manos
Manos are a grinding tool usually made of locally available abrasive
sandstone. Each piece could be roughly chipped and pecked to the appropriate
shape and size. Morphology varied according to need, and each tool was often used
for other functions in addition to grinding.
Pitted Stones
Pitted stones have one or multiple pits or depressions on one or more
fl at surfaces. The type(s) of wear traces observed that characterize each pit or
depression provide some clue as to the general nature of the tasks with which it
was associated. Pits with a roughened or battered appearance were probably used
as bases to accomplish bipolar percussion of small chert or quartzite pebbles or to
secure hardwood nuts during shelling to acquire the nutmeat. Those with smooth
or abraded pits may have functioned as small mortars for crushing and grinding
various materials such as pigments, herbs, and the like.
Slabs and Anvils
Slabs and anvils have broad flat, convex, or slightly concave surfaces with
multiple types of wear: grinding and smoothing, polishing, pitting, and crushing.
Wear type usually indicates that these broad tool faces served as work surfaces
for a variety of tasks. Often, multiple types of wear will occur together on one or
more tool surfaces. Many of the artifacts identified as pitted stones and slabs/anvils
have aspects of each, suggesting that the two functions may have often occurred
in tandem. Some of these artifacts probably also functioned as abraders and are
considered technologically similar to grinding slabs.
Hammerstones
Pebbles and cobbles of dense material with surface battering are identified
as hammerstones. These implements are typically of quartzite or sandstone.
Commonly associated with the manufacture of chipped and ground stone artifacts,
hammerstones probably were also used to pulverize and crush a variety of materials.
Some of these implements could have been used to manufacture or resurface grinding
implements like manos, metates, and grinding slabs.
Polished and Grooved Stones
Polished stones are naturally shaped pebbles or angular pieces of dense
material with smooth and polished exterior surfaces that can be differentiated
from simply stream-worn stones. Occasionally, isolated facets of wear and polish
with very fine striations or scratches are present. Such artifacts probably were
used in the manufacture of ceramic vessels to smooth and burnish the vessel walls.

Chapter 3: Methods of Investigation
Grooved stones are variable in shape and are usually made of abrasive material
like sandstone or ferruginous sandstone. Their functions likely varied but probably
included awl sharpening and shaping.
Grooved Axes
Grooved axes are present as complete and fragmentary specimens, and
occasionally fragments of probable axe preforms have been found. The primary
raw material is hematite. Axes are similar in function to celts but they have a
hafting groove that separates the axe bit and the poll end. Grooved hematite axes
are well known and are quite common in northeast Texas north of the Sabine
River and extending to the Red River in Arkansas and Louisiana (Turner 2006).
Often, fragments of these tools were repurposed into other implements, primarily
hammerstones or small pitted stones.
Celts
A celt is “either an ungrooved or slightly grooved stone axe,” according to
Shafer (1973:299). Suhm et al. (1954:532) describe celts as having a round or oval
cross section at the middle, with one end converging to form the bit and the other end
the poll. When the bit flares out wider than the body, it is referred to as a petaloid
celt. Bit shape is usually convex in plan view. Artifacts in this category frequently
exhibit almost fully ground surfaces but also may have areas with evidence of surface
pecking and battering from the shaping process. Materials typically are dense fineto medium-grained stones like Stanley or Jackfork sandstone and basalt/basalt
porphyries, both of which could be procured in the Ouachita Mountains region.
Occasionally, hematite was also used. Artifacts identified as celt preforms usually
have the general shape of the intended celt but exhibit direct percussion, pecking,
and battering over much of their surfaces from the manufacture process.
Pigment Sources
This category consists of irregularly shaped pieces of hematite, limonite,
and other minerals that exhibit cultural modification such as cutting, striations,
notches, scraping, or percussion flaking. The majority are inferred to have been
used as source material in the production of powdered pigments. Shape and size
are often the result of use in making pigment and not due to deliberate shaping.
Indeterminate Fragments
Fragments of ground stone tools not identifiable as to tool type are classified
as indeterminate. These fragments usually have one or more areas or faces that
exhibit grinding, battering, polishing, or similar wear.
Ceramic Analysis Methods
Ceramic artifact analysis focused on vessel form and attributes including
tempering agent, sherd thickness, surface finish and color, decoration, and design
elements and motifs. These attributes are used to characterize the samples, relate

37

38

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
sherds to defined ceramic types where possible, and provide data from which
inferences could be drawn about the chronological relationships between sites.
Generally, only sherds 1.5 cm in diameter or larger were analyzed. On occasion,
smaller sherds were included if they displayed a unique characteristic such as
peculiar design elements. All sherds were counted and weighed by provenience.
Vessel Form
Four basic forms have been defined for Caddo ceramic vessels: bowls, jars,
bottles, and ollas. These forms generally follow the definitions provided by Rice
(1987:216–217). A bowl may have a restricted or unrestricted orifice with height
varying between one-third the maximum diameter up to the maximum diameter of
the orifice. Jars are necked vessels with a restriction at the neck and an unrestricted
orifice; jar height is generally greater than its maximum diameter. Bottles and ollas
have a highly restricted neck-orifice with a globular or semiglobular body. The classic
Caddo bottle often has a bell-shaped body with a cylindrical neck that can double
the overall vessel height.
To identify vessels within a sample of sherds, inferences must be made
using all of the attributes of the sherd. Vessel part is the main characteristic used
in the determination of vessel form, with carinated sherds, necks, and rims key to
differentiating between bowls, bottles, and jars. However, other sherd characteristics
may also be helpful. For example, a scraped interior surface and the curvature of a
body sherd may indicate it is from a bottle or olla, and a carinated sherd with scroll
motif can be identified as a bowl.
Vessel Attributes
All sherds were sorted into the categories of rim, rim/carination, neck, body,
body/carination, and base. Characteristics recorded for these vessel parts include
rim orientation, orifice diameter, lip form, and base form. Rim orientation (inverted,
everted, straight, or indeterminate) was determined by placing the lip against
a flat surface and rotating the rim to find the angle at which the entire lip is in
contact with the surface. Most rim sherds are too small to indicate vessel orifice
diameter, but for the few that are large enough, this attribute was determined using
a concentric-circle scale graduated in 1-cm increments. Lip form was recorded as
flat, tapered, rounded, rolled, other, or indeterminate. Rim orientation and lip form
may be an indication of vessel function (Rice 1987:241). Everted and straight rims
with straight or tapered lips, which allow unrestricted access to the interior of a
vessel, can be associated generally with serving bowls or cooking pots. Everted rims
with tapered or rolled lips may also allow for easy transfer of vessel contents, and
a straight rim with flat lip could accommodate a lid or stopper. Base sherds were
defined by their relative thickness and angle to the vessel body. Base form includes
flat, rounded, and indeterminate. For Caddo ceramic vessels, the terms “carnation”
or “carinated” are commonly used to describe a sharp change in angle of the vessel
wall, often associated with bowls. The carination point usually would be classed
as a body sherd, but if it is large enough, a section of the rim may also be present.

Chapter 3: Methods of Investigation
Body sherds were defined as all sherds not classifiable as rims or bases; body sherds
make up the majority of the site samples.
Temper
Temper was recorded under 10x magnification on a fresh break as grog, bone,
grog and bone, voids, voids and bone, grog and bone and voids, hematite, grog and
hematite, and sand. Shell temper was not noted. Grog temper is defined as crushed
sherd fragments or prefired fragments of clay. Bone temper is crushed bone, which
though generally white, can show a bluish black coloration characteristic of burning.
Bone temper also may leach from the clay body leaving rounded or angular voids.
Hematite is identified as small reddish nodules within the clay body. Sand tempering
was recorded when large sand grains made up most of the sherd fabric. Both hematite
and sand are natural inclusions in East Texas clays, but the presence of sherds with
large amounts of hematite or sand may signal the selection of particular clays for
ceramic production or the intentional addition of these agents. Clay selection and
tempering agent would have been conscious choices made by the potter as part of
the manufacture process.
Surface Finish and Color
Exterior and interior surface finishes consist of scraping, smoothing/floating,
and burnishing. Scraped surfaces display deep marks from a hard tool that was
pulled across the vessel wall when the clay was still wet. Scraping removes excess
clay from the coiling process of building the vessel wall. These scrape marks usually
follow the horizontal curvature of the vessel wall. Surface smoothing usually follows
scraping to provide a uniform surface. Floating is a technique using a wet hand or
cloth to bring fine clay particles to the surface for a uniform finish. Weathering of
sherds often obscures surface finishes, making it difficult to distinguish a simple
smoothed surface from a floated one; smoothing and floating were collapsed into one
category for this analysis. A burnished surface differs from a smoothed or floated
one in that it is done on a dry or leather-hard vessel wall with a hard rounded tool,
such as stream-rolled pebble. Burnishing can leave parallel tool marks on the surface
along with a lustrous sheen. Aside from its aesthetic value, burnishing compacts
the vessel wall, making it less permeable to liquids.
Exterior surface color and core color were recorded for all sherds in
vernacular terms that can be related to Munsell colors as follows: black, 10YR 2/1,
2/2, 3/1, 3/2; gray, 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; dark brown, 7.5YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6; light brown,
7.5YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; reddish brown, 5YR 5/4; brownish red, 10R 3/3, 4/4; red, 10R
4/8, 5/6, 5/8; reddish yellow, 7.5YR 6/6; yellow, 10YR 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8, 7/6, 7/8; white
gley, 8/N; and green gley, 5/5G. These are meant to provide a description of a sherd’s
general color as it might have corresponded to the complete vessel. The colors are
not intended to provide definitive evidence of the firing technology.

Vessel Decoration, Elements, and Motifs
Vessel decoration, important in relating assemblages to established ceramic
types and possible intergroup relationships, was recorded using the categories of
decorative technique, design element and motif. Decorative techniques recognized
include brushing, incising, engraving, punctating, pinching, ridging, appliquéing,
and a combination of these techniques. Brushing refers to roughening by dragging a
cluster of sticks or stiff grass across the wet or semiwet surface of the vessel. Incising
was used to create generally fine-line decorations inscribed into the vessel surface
with a hard tool while the clay was still plastic, and engraving was used to make such
decorations after the clay hardened. Punctating involved using a fingernail or hard
tool to gouge indentations into a wet clay surface. Pinching refers to using fingernails
to pinch up ridges of wet clay, while ridging is similar but with the irregularities of
the pinched ridges smoothed over. Appliquéing involves attaching strips or nodes
of clay to the vessel surface; sometimes the strips were subsequently punctated.
The design elements identified range from nondistinctive engraved, incised,
or appliquéd lines to somewhat more-distinctive sets of lines that can be oriented on a
vessel to combinations of decorations (e.g., incised and punctated) that can be related
to specific motifs and ceramic types. Identifying specific motifs was problematic
because many of the incised and engraved wares used in the region prehistorically
had complex motifs that are hard to identify in sherd-based analyses, especially
when both samples and sherds are small and sherds are eroded.
A motif is “a complex unit of design consisting of a configuration or pattern
of configurations that retains its identity across a number of vessels and/or design
contexts within a particular style repertory” (Jernigan 1986:10–11). Motifs include
zone of punctations, zoned diagonal lines, diagonal lines at the rim, alternating
parallel lines, horizontal rows of punctations at the rim, vertical parallel lines at the
rim, and horizontal lines at the rim. Very few motifs were identified in this analysis,
though, and those that were are not particularly helpful in making type associations.

Chapter 4: results of testing

This chapter describes the seven sites investigated during this project,
the work done there, and the results of that work. For each site, sections describe
setting, previous investigations, work accomplished, sediments, site extent and
depth, cultural features, materials recovered, radiocarbon dates, and summary and
conclusions.
Site 41rk674
Setting
Site 41RK674 is situated on a broad, gently rolling interfluve summit
overlooking the Cherokee Bayou floodplain (Figure 4.1). Surface elevation ranges
from 275 to 285 ft above mean sea level, with the floodplain to the north at
240–250 ft. The southeast side of the site is bordered by an intermittent drainage
flowing northeast across the valley wall. Another drainage is about 220 m westnorthwest of the site. Both flow into an unnamed tributary that joins Cherokee
Bayou approximately 550 m north of the site. The drainage that passes closest
to the site is dammed in two places, with a large stock tank immediately south of
the site. The site is in the corner of a maintained pasture that covers much of the
interfluve summit. Vegetation bordering the south and east sides of the pasture
is dense secondary growth of deciduous hardwoods, yaupons, and vines. A small
sand-mining operation removed portions of the north edge of the landform. The
proximity of the sand pit and an adjacent spoil pile suggest that this operation may
have damaged or removed parts of a once-larger site area. However, examination of
the cut face of the sand pit revealed no additional cultural materials.
Previous Investigations
Site 41RK674 was initially recorded in 2012 during survey of the Rusk
Permit’s Area W (Dockall et al. 2014). Thirty-seven shovel tests were excavated
across the site, and 10 contained artifacts. Recovered materials consist of 18 ceramic
sherds, 1 distal flake fragment, 1 complete flake, and several possible fire-cracked
rocks. The shovel tests indicated that artifacts were most frequent between 20
and 60 cm below the surface. Site 41RK674 was one of only two sites in the survey
Area Where Caddo ceramics substantially outnumbered lithic artifacts. Additional
work was recommended to assess the relationship between 41RK674 and nearby
Caddo mound centers Hudnall-Pirtle, Lane Mitchell, and Pine Tree Mound to better
understand Caddo settlement systems.

Work Accomplished
Only the north part of the site was tested, as that area contained most of the
positive survey shovel tests. The untested southern two-thirds of the site appears to

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
be a very sparse lithic scatter, with only two positive shovel tests there containing
one flake and a piece of burned clay. Within the northern section, testing focused
on two microtopographic highs termed the East and West Knolls, as these areas
had positive shovel tests during survey and the intervening area did not. Trenches
and test units were evenly distributed across the two knolls. Three trenches and 5
test units were excavated on the West Knoll, and 7 trenches and 11 test units were
excavated on the East Knoll. Trenches varied from 8 to 10 m in length, with an
average of 9.8 m. Trench depth ranged from 0.6 to 1.3 m, with an average of 1.0 m.
Trench excavations totaled 156 m2. Test unit depth varied from 0.5 to 1.0 m with
an average of 0.79 m; 13.1 m3 of sediment were removed and screened.
Site Sediments
Area soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand (Griffith 2000). They are
very deep, well-drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy marine deposits on
uplands (Soil Survey Staff, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service 2009b). Excavations on the East Knoll revealed three sediment
zones. The uppermost zone is 20–30 cm of brown to dark yellowish brown fine sandy
loam with many fine roots and common krotovina. Zone II consists of 20–75 cm of
yellowish brown fine sandy loam or silty sand with common krotovina and lamellae.
The third zone was reached only in Test Units 5, 13, 15, and 16; it consists of strong
brown clayey sand at depths of 50–90 cm below the surface. Sediment profiles on
the West Knoll were shallower. The uppermost zone consists of 15–20 cm of brown
to dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam. Zone II is 15–35 cm of yellowish brown
fine sandy loam. Zone III is strong brown clayey sand, which was reached between
30 and 50 cm below the surface. Lamellae are not prevalent in these thinner
sediments. Zones I and II represent A and E horizons developed in sands freed up
by weathering of the clayey Eocene bedrock (Zone III, truncated Bt horizon) and
perhaps redeposited by colluvial or eolian processes during the Holocene.
Active rodent burrows and krotovina were observed in all of the trenches
and test units. Burned roots were encountered in Trench 3 and Test Units 2 and
16. These are likely the result of historic land clearing. A bolt recovered from Test
Unit 14 at 30–40 cm below the surface likely was displaced from the surface by
rodent activity.
Site Extent and Depth
Artifacts were recovered from all but one of the test units and seven of the
trenches, indicating that cultural materials are scattered across the two knolls
(Table 4.1). Lower densities of artifacts are found on the West Knoll (Test Units
9–12 and 14), with an average of 9.2 items/m2,, than on the East Knoll (37.7/m2). The
highest frequencies were in Test Units 13 and 16 (69 and 81 items, respectively).
Looking at all of the test units combined, frequencies are greatest in Levels 3 and
4 (20–40 cm), with appreciable quantities of artifacts occurring at 0–70 cm. Due
to the degree of rodent disturbance, it is unlikely that the vertical distribution of
artifacts is meaningful.

Note: Artifacts from other proveniences consist of 3 sherds from Trench 1, 1 sherd and 1 ground stone from Trench 2,
10 sherds from Trench 3, 14 sherds from Trench 5, 5 sherds from Trench 7, 3 sherds from Trench 8, and 11 sherds
and 1 piece of debitage from Trench 9.

Cultural Features
No cultural features were identified in any of the test units or trenches.
Materials Recovered
The artifacts recovered from 41RK674 consist of 2 cores, 25 pieces of debitage,
4 chipped stone tools, 3 ground stone tools, 466 prehistoric ceramic sherds, 4 faunal
bone fragments, 2 mussel shells, and 3.46 g of carbonized plant remains. Appendix
A contains metric data for the lithic tools.
Cores and Debitage
One of the two cores is a small (37.1 mm) local gravel chert pebble. Reduction
attempted by bipolar percussion resulted in localized battering on one end and
splintering and step fractures on the opposing end. The second core is a fist-sized
(90.2 mm) hematite cobble that had been previously used as a hammerstone based
on surface battering on the edges and faces. One end had been truncated by removal
of a large percussion flake to create a single-faceted striking platform for attempts
to remove additional percussion flakes. Several small flakes were removed, most
of them resulting in step and hinge terminations. Some exterior cortex is visible,
suggesting that this piece is not a recycled tool fragment such as an axe.
The very small debitage sample consists of five gravel chert, one gravel
quartzite, six hematite, two silicified wood, one mudstone, two ferruginous sandstone,
four other chert, and four Edwards Plateau chert. Sixty-eight percent of these are
locally obtained materials, and 32 percent (the other chert and Edwards chert) are
nonlocal. Both local and nonlocal materials are small (i.e., Size Grades 3–5), reflecting
the use of initially small local raw materials and a focus on tool maintenance rather
than tool manufacture. This is also indicated in the distribution of flake types by
size grade (Table 4.2). Five flakes with polish were removed from ground stone tools

like hoes, adzes, and celts or possibly the edges of finished pitted stones. There are
eight pieces of debitage with dorsal cortex, most of locally available gravel chert,
silicified wood, and mudstone.

Chipped Stone Tools
There are two small arrow points in the assemblage (Figure 4.2). The first
is an untyped bifacially flaked point with a triangular blade and short contracting
stem with straight edges and base (Figure 4.2a). Blade edges are coarsely serrated
by bifacial pressure flaking. The raw material is fine-grained gray Edwards chert
resembling Georgetown in texture and appearance. The second arrow point is a
heavily resharpened Friley point manufactured of local, possibly heat-treated, gravel
chert (Figure 4.b). Both shoulders/barbs were resharpened with the blade, and the
stem appears to have been modified similarly. One blade edge is slightly convex,
and the other is concave with a portion of the barb remaining.
An indeterminate silicified wood biface fragment was recovered (Figure 4.2c).
Portion, stage of manufacture, cause of breakage, and discard reason are not known,
although the piece may exhibit a remnant of a bending fracture on one end. The
second bifacial artifact is a hematite mass that has been percussion flaked bifacially
along one convex edge and also exhibits other percussion trimming (Figure 4.2d).
The flaked edge is blunted and battered by use as a chopper and has been severely
step fractured from this action. One surface is the exterior cobble face, which has
been moderately weathered.
Ground Stone Tools
The three ground stone tools are a hammerstone, a possible axe fragment,
and a slab. All are of hematite. The hammerstone is a fractured mass that has
been percussion flaked on one end and subsequently heavily battered and blunted
from use. The surface is also battered and bruised from hammerstone wear. The
angular axe fragment is a small bit or cutting edge portion and has remnants of
two intersecting faces. The face remnants are polished and smoothed, and the bit
edge has additional damage from use. The tabular hematite slab has bidirectionally

percussion-flaked edges (Figure 4.3). Surfaces and edges have been smoothed/
polished/ground through use and handling. The upper and lower faces are well
polished and flat or slightly concave. This artifact may have served as a source for
pigment or a working surface/anvil.
Ceramics
The vessel ceramics consist of 466 sherds weighing 1,797.6 g. Of these, 283
(1,578.9 g), or 61 percent (88 percent by weight), are greater than 1.5 cm in diameter
and form the analyzed sample. The majority (83 percent) are tempered with grog
(n = 100), grog and bone (n = 110), or grog and bone plus voids left by leached bone
(n = 24). Bone and bone and voids occur in 32 sherds, and hematite occurs with grog
or grog and bone in 17 sherds. There are 233 body sherds, 6 carinated body sherds,

23 carinated rim sherds, 9 neck sherds, and 10 base sherds. Bases are flat (n = 8)
or rounded (n = 2). Rim orientation is generally everted (n = 16); also present are
2 straight rims, 1 inverted rim, and 4 rims of indeterminate orientation. Rim lip
form is rounded (n = 10), rolled (n = 10), flat (n = 3), or indeterminate (n = 1). All of
these sherds are no greater than 5 cm across, and most are too small to be used to
distinguish vessel form. However, 12 sherds can be identified as bowls (n = 6), bottles
(n = 5), and a possible olla. The bottle and olla sherds were identified based on their
curvature and scraped interior surfaces. It is also likely that the neck sherds and
some of the everted rims represent jars. The body and rim sherds range in thickness
from 3.60 to 9.98 mm (mean = 6.58 mm, standard deviation = 1.18). Base thickness
ranges from 6.55 to 14.12 mm (mean = 9.22 mm, standard deviation = 1.99). The
wide ranges in thickness suggest that a variety of vessel sizes are represented.
Many of these sherds are weathered on both the exterior and interior
surfaces, and many show scrapes that may be modern plow damage. Nonetheless,
surface finish could be identified on all but 2–3 percent. Exteriors are mostly textured

(i.e., brushed) or smoothed (44 and 42 percent), with 12 percent being burnished.
Interiors are predominantly smoothed (80 percent), with 15 percent burnished and
only 2 percent scraped. Surface color is mainly light brown (50 percent), although
reddish yellow (17 percent), gray (12 percent), and dark brown (8 percent) are
represented as well, along with small numbers of black, red, reddish brown, and
pink sherds. Core color is generally gray (45 percent), black (28 percent), or light
brown (18 percent); minor core colors are reddish yellow, dark brown, red, reddish
brown, pink, and yellow.
Decorated sherds make up 61 percent (n = 173) of the sample. Sherds
with brushing (n = 110), brushing with appliqué and punctations (n = 11), and
brushing with punctations (n = 9) constitute 75 percent of all decorated sherds. As
such, brushing is the main decorative element. Twenty-three sherds have crossed
brushing; 18 have horizontal brushing, often at the rim; 7 have diagonal brushing; 4
have vertical brushing; and 1 has multidirectional brushing (Figure 4.4). Secondary
elements associated with brushing consist of a line of punctations, often below the
lip, and horizontal or vertical appliqué lines with or without punctations (see Figure
4.4c–f). The appliqué lines can demarcate panels of brushing around the vessel
body, which is characteristic of the type Pease Brushed-Incised (Suhm and Jelks
1962:119). Five sherds in this sample could be associated with this type (see Figure
4.4e–f). Another brushed sherd with intersecting appliqué lines may represent
the type Harleton Appliqué (see Figure 4.4g). Instead of simple panels, Harleton
Appliqué vessels often display complex designs on the vessel body made with lines
of appliqué (Suhm and Jelks 1962:65).
Sherds with appliqué (n = 1), punctations and incising (n = 4), fingernail
punctations (n = 9), or pinching (n = 1) make up 9 percent the decorated sample,
while incised (n = 8) and engraved (n = 20) decorations make up 16 percent. Elements
with punctations or pinching consist of simple lines or fields of punctations (Figure
4.5a). These cannot be associated with any particular type. Incised or engraved
decorations on small sherds also can be difficult to associate with particular types.
Incised and engraved elements recognized in this sample consist of rectilinear lines,
diagonal lines, horizontal lines, curvilinear lines, and hatching. Two larger evertedrim sections have incised motifs. They appear to be from jars; one may be classified
simply as utility ware, while the second may be typed as Maydelle Incised (Figure
4.5b–c). Maydelle Incised is characterized by directionally alternating parallel
diagonal lines (Suhm and Jelks 1962:103). Two engraved sherds have enough of a
motif remaining to suggest they may be associated with the type Ripley Engraved
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:127–129). One appears to be a bottle sherd based on its
curvature and scraped interior; the second may be from a jar or bowl (Figure 4.5d–e).
The presence of sherds typed as Ripley Engraved, Pease Brushed-Incised,
and Harleton Appliqué and the predominance of brushed decoration suggest that
41RK674 has a strong Late Caddo component. This is supported by the fact that
the percentages of brushed sherds and total decorated sherds in the 41RK674
assemblage (46 and 61 percent, respectively) are close to those for the Pine Tree
Mound site (51 and 67 percent; Fields and Gadus 2012:470) and distinctly different
than those for the Oak Hill Village site (10 and 51 percent; Rogers and Perttula

medium to medium-large unidentified mammals. Two mussel shell fragments are
too incomplete for further analysis. They were recovered from Test Unit 3, Level 3.
Carbonized Botanical Remains
The charred botanical remains, described in Appendix B, were recovered
from three samples submitted for identification prior to radiocarbon dating. The
samples were obtained from hand excavation of Levels 3 and 7 of Test Unit 13. All
three samples were identified as hickory nutshell (Carya sp.).
Radiocarbon Dates
Three radiocarbon dates were obtained on carbonized nutshell samples from
Test Unit 13 (Appendix C). All three indicate occupation of 41RK674 during the Late
Caddo period. The two-sigma calibrated date ranges obtained on two samples from
Level 3 are a.d. 1445–1525 and 1555–1630 (Beta-402633) and a.d. 1440–1520 and

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
1575–1630 (Beta-402634). Based on the CALIB radiocarbon calibration program
(Rev7.1.0; Stuiver et al. 2015), the earlier ranges have higher probabilities than the
later ones in both cases (0.65 vs. 0.35; 0.73 vs. 0.27). The two-sigma calibrated range
for the sample from Level 7 is a.d. 1430–1485 (Beta-402635). The overlap in these
dates suggest that 41RK674 was occupied in the mid to late a.d. 1400s.
Summary and Conclusions
The main part of 41RK674 occupies two adjacent rises in an upland setting
atop the valley wall overlooking the Cherokee Bayou floodplain to the north. Ten
trenches and 16 test units were used to investigate these two areas, which together
cover 3,100 m2. The excavations yielded a sizeable collection of 466 prehistoric
ceramic sherds and a small collection of 34 lithic artifacts. The ceramic artifact
density (26.2/m2) is the second highest among the seven tested sites, and the
lithic density (2.0/m2) is nearly tied for lowest. Most of the artifacts (88 percent of
both sherds and lithics) are from the larger eastern rise, and this is where Native
Americans concentrated their activities.
The excavations identified no cultural features, probably because most of the
site contains thick upland sands where matrix-supported features such as postholes
and pits have a low likelihood of survival and recognition, given the nature of the
sediments and the degree of bioturbation. On the eastern rise, just 4 of the 11 test
units reached the Eocene substrate at depths of 50–90 cm (average = 72 cm); the other
7 units ended at 100 cm without fully penetrating the surface sands. The western
rise has thinner sands, as all 5 test units there reached the Eocene substrate at
30–50 cm. Most artifacts were found at 0–70 cm on the eastern rise and 0–40 cm on
the western rise. There are no indications in their vertical distributions that they
could be segregated into components. On the eastern rise, ceramics occur at 0–90 cm,
with 95 percent generally evenly distributed between the surface and 70 cm; lithic
artifacts occur at 0–100 cm, with 90 percent at 0–80 cm. On the western rise, the
three lithic artifacts were found at 10–40 cm, and the ceramics were at 0–40 cm.
Three radiocarbon dates on materials from nonfeature contexts indicate that
the site was occupied in the mid to late a.d. 1400s. The ceramic artifacts support this
interpretation, given the presence of sherds assignable to several Late Caddo types
(Ripley Engraved, Pease Brushed-Incised, and Harleton Appliqué), the predominance
of brushing, and the high incidence of decoration overall. The only temporally
diagnostic lithic artifact is a Friley arrow point found at a depth of 10–20 cm on
the western rise. It suggests that at least that area has a late Woodland or Early
Caddo component as well; no other artifacts can be associated with that occupation.
Site 41RK674 appears to be mostly a Late Caddo residential site, probably
a farmstead, based on the ceramic assemblage and its high density. The fact that
no midden is present suggests that its use in this way occurred over a relatively
short time. The absence of preserved cultural features means that this site has a low
capacity to contribute important information about this kind of Caddo occupation.
The artifacts and dates generated by this project are instructive about the age
and likely function of the site, but without features the site cannot provide any

51

52

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
information about farmstead spatial organization. With this limitation, 41RK674
is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41RK680
Setting
Site 41RK680 is on a series of slightly elevated areas along Cherokee Bayou
and the adjacent floodplain (Figure 4.6). Situated at an elevation of 240–250 ft, the
site is in a terrain characterized by undulating topography with low wet sloughs
and periodically inundated interconnecting short drainages. The elevated areas
are ca. 1–2 m higher than the adjacent floodplain surface. Only the southern part
of the site was tested, as the northern part is outside the life-of-mine disturbance
boundary. The tested area consists of open pasture with woods along a drainage
that flows southeast to northwest. The area north of the disturbance boundary
is heavily wooded with cypress, sweetgum, oak, elm, and infrequent loblolly pine
trees; understory plants include sapling hardwoods, greenbriers, yaupon thickets,
and poison ivy.
The northern edge of the site is defined by the existing channel of Cherokee
Bayou, and the south, east, and west edges are in the floodplain. The topography of
the tested portion of the site is characterized by shallow flood chutes, wet-weather
drainage channels, and possibly dissected relict levee deposits that remain as slightly
higher parts of the floodplain landscape.
The most obvious disturbance factors in the tested area are construction
of a well pad road, previous clearing to create pastures, and gopher burrowing in
more-elevated areas. In addition, evidence of what is likely to be historic-age or
modern burning was seen in Test Units 6, 7, and 10 and Trenches 3 and 7. Test
Unit 10 was excavated to sample a burned feature first seen in Trench 7. Colorless
glass was found in most levels from 0 to 90 cm below the surface, and the feature
was determined to be of modern origin. An aluminum can was found at 90–100 cm
below the surface in Test Unit 2.
Previous Investigations
Site 41RK680 was recorded in 2012 during survey of the Rusk Permit’s
Area W (Dockall et al. 2014). A total of 79 shovel tests were excavated; 24 were
positive for prehistoric cultural material. The recovered assemblage consists of 28
pieces of lithic debitage, 1 biface, 2 ground stone artifact fragments, and 1 small
plain sherd. Artifacts were fairly evenly distributed throughout the vertical column.
The site was recommended for testing to determine if it contains information about
Native American use of the floodplain or Caddo settlement systems, particularly
Early Caddo settlement as related to the Hudnall-Pirtle site to the northeast.
Work Accomplished
Two areas in the southern half of the site (i.e., the part inside the life-ofmine disturbance boundary) were tested; both had positive shovel tests during

survey. The main tested area is within maintained pasture north of the well pad
road. Ten trenches and 11 test units were placed here, just south of the disturbance
boundary. The wooded area to the east was not investigated because most of the
survey shovel tests there were negative. A small microtopographic high in the pasture
approximately 60 m south of the road was tested with 2 trenches and 2 test units.
The areas north, east, and south of this rise were not tested because they are low
and wet, and the survey shovel tests there were mostly negative. Backhoe trenches
varied from 8 to 10 m in length, with an average of 9.7 m. All 10 trenches in the
north portion of the tested Area Were excavated to a depth of 1.3 m. Trenches 11
and 12 in the south part were excavated to 1.2 m, where they hit the water table.
Trench excavations totaled 174 m2. All test units were excavated to 1 m below the
surface; 13 m3 of sediment were removed and screened.
Site Sediments
Soils are mapped as Laneville loam north of the road and Owentown fine
sandy loam south of it; both soils are frequently flooded (Griffith 2000). Laneville
series soils consist of very deep, moderately well-drained soils that formed in loamy
and clayey alluvium on floodplains draining mainly the Wilcox Formation (Soil
Survey Staff, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service 2009a). Owentown series soils are also very deep and moderately well
drained; they are moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy coastal plain
alluvium (Soil Survey Staff, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service 2002).
Test unit and trench excavations documented the presence of three general
sediment zones. Zone I consists of 10 to 25 cm of brown to dark brown silty sand to
fine sandy loam with common roots and krotovina. Zone II is yellowish brown silty
sand to fine sandy loam extending to depths of 40 to 60 cm below surface. Zone II
also has common krotovina and roots. Zone III is yellowish brown silty sand to fine
sandy loam with dark and light yellowish brown mottles and common lamellae.
Zone III extended to the base of every excavation (100–140 cm below surface),
except in Trench 4, which hit strong brown sandy clay subsoil at 120 cm below the
surface. Soils were very moist at the base of the excavations on the north side of
the road and completely saturated on the south side. Given the characteristics of
the sediments and their position on the landscape, Zones I–III represent A and E
horizons developed in Holocene alluvium, while the sandy clay subsoil at the base
of Trench 4 is a truncated Bt horizon likely formed in Eocene bedrock or Pleistocene
terrace deposits. No depositional structures indicative of intact stratigraphy were
observed in the Holocene deposits, presumably because of thorough bioturbation.
Site Extent and Depth
Artifacts were recovered from all 13 of the test units and 3 of the 12 backhoe
trenches (all of which were within the site boundaries as determined during survey),
and thus testing added no new information about the horizontal extent of the site
(Table 4.3). Artifact densities were low overall (10.5/m2), but they were especially
sparse in Test Units 12 and 13 south of the well pad road. Hence, it appears that

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
the northern part, closest to Cherokee Bayou, was used more intensively than the
southern part. Artifacts were fairly evenly distributed vertically between 10 and
100 cm when looking at all test units combined. The highest frequencies were at
40–70 cm, but this peak is not strong enough to be particularly notable.

Notes: Level 2 in Test Unit 2 was 0–20 cm below the surface. Artifacts from other proveniences consist of 1 ground
stone from Trench 4, 1 ground stone from Trench 8, and 1 piece of debitage from Trench 12.

Cultural Features
No cultural features were identified in any of the test units or trenches.
Materials Recovered
The artifacts recovered from 41RK680 consist of 129 pieces of unmodified
debitage, 2 chipped stone tool fragments, and 8 whole and fragmentary ground stone
implements. Appendix A contains metric data for the lithic tools. Also recovered
were 1 thermally altered rock, 1 faunal bone fragment, and 4.26 g of carbonized
botanical remains. No ceramics or other temporally diagnostic artifacts were found.
Debitage
The modest debitage sample represents mostly local materials (64 percent)
and materials of unknown origin (31 percent), with very few items of nonlocal stone
(5 percent). The local materials are as follows: gravel chert, n = 43; gravel quartzite,
n = 6; silicified wood, n = 22; chalcedony, n = 1; and hematite, n = 10. Eleven chert
flakes and 29 quartzite flakes are of materials of unknown origin. The nonlocal
materials (5 flakes of Edwards chert, 1 flake of Stanley/Jackfork sandstone, and 1
flake of unidentified gray chert) indicate some participation in regional exchange
in which exotic lithic materials were procured, almost certainly as finished items.
Stanley and Jackfork sandstones typically were used for manufacture of ground and
polished ungrooved celts, and the single flake of this material suggests that such
a tool was used and maintained at the site at some point in its history. Size-grade
distributions by flake type indicate a predominance of debris generated during tool

55

manufacture and tool maintenance (bending, punch, and pressure) as opposed to
core reduction (conchoidal) (Table 4.4). Given the small size of the gravel cherts and
quartzites that occur in the project area, it is likely that much of the conchoidal flake
debris was generated in early-stage manufacture of stone tools rather than flake
production. This is also suggested by the near-absence of edge-modified flake tools
in the lithic assemblage. The few flakes with polish on the dorsal surface include
hematite and Stanley/Jackfork sandstone and thus are debris from the manufacture
or maintenance of ground stone tools.

Chipped Stone Tools
A single small distal biface fragment manufactured of Edwards Plateau chert
was recovered. A remnant of the ventral flake surface is present, and the remaining
lateral edges and tip exhibit well-controlled marginal pressure flaking. The biface
exhibits a small bending fracture. A small distal flake fragment of Edwards chert
has unifacial edge nibbling from use or pressure flaking. The piece has a deliberate
radial fracture indicating that the tool was broken after the retouch, perhaps as an
effort to recycle material or extend the life of the tool.
Ground Stone Tools
Two hammerstones were recovered. One is ferruginous sandstone and
may be a well-used fragment of another ground stone implement. The sides of the
tool have been heavily battered and fractured from use, and one surface retains a
remnant of a smoothed surface. Portions have well-developed wear facets from use
as a hammerstone. The second specimen is a hematite fragment that has battering
and overlapping step and hinge fractures on the surfaces and ends.
Two pitted stones were recovered. Both are of materials that could be
procured within the middle Sabine River basin. One is a heavy and massive,
weathered, subangular cobble of hematite gravel conglomerate with two probable
use-produced depressions or pits on one face. The roughened appearance of the pits
does not resemble natural weathering. The bottom of the cobble has an elongated
abraded and smoothed area that may have been produced during use as the stone

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
sat on some type of hard support. The second pitted stone is of loosely cemented
yellowish orange (ocher-enriched) sandstone; it is roughly subangular square in
shape and has a smooth depression on one surface and a very convex smooth bottom
surface (Figure 4.7a). Some very weak natural bedding planes or laminations are
visible in the sandstone material. The bottom of the surface depression is roughened
by light pecking, which may have been done to enhance the abrasive qualities of
the softer sandstone. The implement was probably multifunctional and served as
an abrasive surface and as a hand mano.
A large tabular fragment of a local ferruginous sandstone has two broad
faces that have been smoothed and pitted from use in multiple functions that include
grinding, abrading, and crushing (Figure 4.7b). These surfaces also appear to have
functioned as general working and anvil surfaces. Most of the edges are weathered
smooth, but one end has had several percussion flakes removed to roughly trim it.
One end is a natural fracture. One face has a localized, well-developed, smooth pit
measuring about 44 mm in diameter and about 20 mm deep. Faint grooves and
scratches are present on the opposing surface.
A polished stone is a subangular hematite fragment. The polished and
worn appearance may be from handling as a curated personal item or from use as
a pigment source. There are no striations or wear facets, although the flattened
ends may have been created by wear. A fragment of ferruginous sandstone and
an angular piece of hematite appear to be fragments of unidentified ground stone
implements. They cannot be attributed to specific artifact forms or functions, but
both retain polished or smoothed exterior surface areas.
Thermally Altered Rock
One piece of thermally altered rock was collected from the Trench 9 backdirt.
No cultural feature was observed associated with this artifact.
Faunal Remains
One unburned small to medium-sized mammal bone was recovered from
Test Unit 7, Level 1. The bone is likely modern.
Carbonized Botanical Remains
Also collected were 4.26 g of carbonized plant remains. Three samples were
sent for identification as candidates for radiocarbon dating (see Appendix B). The
first sample, from Level 8 of Test Unit 2, was identified as pine wood (Pinus sp.) and
was not submitted for dating. The other two samples were from Level 8 of Test Unit
4 and Level 5 of Test Unit 8; both were identified as hickory nutshell (Carya sp.).
Radiocarbon Dates
Two radiocarbon dates were obtained on carbonized hickory nutshell
fragments recovered from Level 8 of Test Unit 4 and Level 5 of Test Unit 8 (see
Appendix C). The two-sigma calibrated date ranges for the sample from Test

Unit 4 are a.d. 715–745 and 765–890 (Beta-402636). The two-sigma calibrated
date ranges for the sample from Test Unit 8 are a.d. 670–775 and 790–800 (Beta402637). Based on the CALIB radiocarbon calibration program (Rev7.1.0; Stuiver
et al. 2015), the late range for the first date and the early range for the second date
have the higher probabilities (0.88 and 0.90). These dates indicate use of the site
during the late part of the Woodland period.
Summary and Conclusions
The tested southern part of 41RK680 occupies slightly elevated sections
of a low terrace on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain. Twelve trenches and 13 test
units were used to investigate two nearby rises, which together cover 2,350 m2. The
excavations yielded a modest collection of 139 lithic artifacts but no ceramic sherds.
The artifact density (10.5/m2) is moderately low. Most of the artifacts (94 percent)
are from the larger northern rise, and this is where Native Americans concentrated
their activities.
The excavations identified no cultural features, probably because most of the
site contains thick homogeneous alluvial sands where matrix-supported features
such as postholes and pits have a low likelihood of survival and recognition, given
the nature of the sediments and the degree of bioturbation. All of the test units ended
at 100 cm without encountering pre-Holocene deposits. The artifacts are generally
evenly distributed between 10 and 100 cm below the surface; there are no indications
in their vertical distributions that they could be segregated into components.
Two radiocarbon dates on materials from nonfeature contexts indicate that
the site was occupied sometime in the a.d. 600s–800s, i.e., the late Woodland period.
There are no temporally diagnostic artifacts to support this or to indicate whether
materials of other ages are present as well. At first blush, the absence of ceramics
would seem to argue against a Woodland-age occupation, but the floodplain setting
may indicate that the site was used in a nonintensive fashion where a limited range
of activities not involving the use of ceramic containers was performed. The low
artifact density is consistent with this interpretation.
The absence of preserved cultural features and inability to segregate the
artifacts into components (or to determine if more than one component is present)
means that the site has a low capacity to contribute important information. The
artifacts and dates generated by this project are somewhat instructive about the
age and possible function of the site, but without features the site cannot provide
any information about site spatial organization. With this limitation, the tested
southern portion of 41RK680 is considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places.
Site 41rk693
Setting
Site 41RK693 is on an interfluve atop the valley wall on the south side of the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain at elevations of 325–335 ft. It is confined primarily to the

59

60

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
midslope area just below the summit (Figure 4.8). The site overlooks the adjoining
floodplain, and steep slopes sur­round the interfluve. Vegetation is dense decid­uous
woodlands and secondary growth that give way to dense wetland vegetation below.
The site has been clear-cut or selectively thinned in the past. Disturbances include
pig rooting, a gas well access road and paralleling pipeline just west and south of
the site, erosion, tree throws, and an all-terrain-vehicle two-track road on the east
edge of the site.

Previous Investigations
The site was recorded in 2012 during survey of the Rusk Permit’s Area W
(Dockall et al. 2014). Twenty-five shovel tests were excavated, 12 of which contained
ar­tifacts. The assemblage consists of 3 pieces of lithic debitage, 35 prehistoric ceramic
sherds, 1 ground stone, and 3 pieces of burned clay. Artifacts were distributed ver­
tically within the upper 60 cm of the deposits, with only 1 sherd being recovered
at 60–80 cm. Site 41RK693 was one of only two sites in the survey Area Where
Caddo ceramics substantially outnumbered lithic artifacts. Additional work was
recommended to assess the relationship between 41RK693 and nearby Caddo mound
centers Hudnall-Pirtle, Lane Mitchell, and Pine Tree Mound to better understand
Caddo settlement systems.
Work Accomplished
Test excavations consisted of mechanical excavation by backhoe and manual
excavation of 1x1-m test units. Four backhoe trenches and 10 test units were
excavated. A natural gas pipeline and dense vegetation limited backhoe trench
placement to the two-track road on the east side of the site and another small
clearing farther west. The trenches varied in length from 6 to 9 m, with an average
of 7.3 m. Trench depth ranged from 0.7 to 1.0 m with an average of 0.9 m. Trench
excavations totaled 31 m2. The 10 test units ranged in depth from 0.5 to 1.0 m, with
an average of 0.9 cm. A total of 8.4 m3 were removed and screened.
Site Sediments
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand (Griffin 2000). These are very
deep, well-drained soils commonly found on gently to moderate sloping interfluves.
They formed in sandy and loamy marine deposits on uplands on the Claiborne
geologic group (Soil Survey Staff, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service 2009b).
The trenches and test units revealed three sediment zones across the site.
The uppermost zone is a pale brown to light grayish brown loamy fine sand A
horizon; it varies between 10 and 25 cm thick. Zone II, which is 25–60 cm thick, is
a light yellowish brown to yellowish brown loamy fine sand E horizon with common
roots and krotovina. Clay lamellae were present in it on the west side of the site.
Zone III, the yellowish brown to strong brown sandy clay loam Bt horizon developed
in Eocene deposits, was reached between 40 and 90 cm below the surface. It was
shallowest in Trench 4 and Test Units 4, 5, and 8 in the central and southern parts
of the site and deepest in Trench 2 and Test Units 1, 2, 6, and 7, most of which were
along the east edge of the site.
Site Extent and Depth
When 41RK693 was initially recorded, its extent was noted to be about
60 m northwest-southeast by 40 m southwest-northeast. Testing confirmed the
site limits, expanding the boundary about 10 m south along the well pad road.
Artifact densities are highest in the western portion of the site in Test Units 6 and

61

62

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
9, which yielded 133 and 155 artifacts (Table 4.5). Although artifact densities are
high in these units, there is no staining to suggest a midden or other features. The
remaining units have an average artifact density of only 16.6 m2, with Test Units
1, 7, 8, and 10 on the north, east, and south edges having very low frequencies (no
more than 4 artifacts each). Lithic artifacts are infrequent almost everywhere, and
10 of the 18 specimens came from Test Unit 9.

Note: Artifacts from other proveniences consist of 1 sherd from Trench 1, 4 sherds from Trench 2, 38 sherds and
1 ground stone from Trench 3, and 3 sherds from Trench 4.

Artifacts were recovered throughout the vertical column (0–100 cm). They
are most prevalent at 10–80 cm when looking at all units together. In the two units
with the most artifacts, there are hints of multiple peaks in one (Levels 2, 4–5, and
7–9 in Test Unit 6) but less so in the other (Levels 2–5 and 7 in Test Unit 9).
Cultural Features
A single feature was encountered. Feature 1 is a small shallow pit (Figure
4.9). It was first encountered in the northwest corner of Test Unit 4 near the base of
Level 4 (38 cm below surface). The pit is only 10 cm deep. The horizontal dimensions
are 26 cm north-south by more than 18 cm east-west. The feature extends into the
west wall of the unit and was not fully excavated. The feature fill is gray to very
dark gray mottled silty sand surrounded by brownish yellow sand. The feature
boundaries are not distinct and have likely been disturbed by roots, rodents, and
insects. A single undecorated ceramic sherd was found in association with the feature,
but overall artifact densities are very low in the vicinity of Feature 1. Carbonized
botanical remains recovered from hand excavation and flotation of the feature fill
includes corn cob and kernel fragments, hickory and walnut nutshells, a purslane
seed, cherry pits, and hickory, pine, oak, and grape wood (see Appendix B). Given
the presence of carbonized wood and edible plant remains, Feature 1 may be a small
cooking pit, although no evidence of in situ heating was noted.

Materials Recovered
The artifacts recovered from
41RK693 consist of 14 pieces of
unmodified chipped stone debitage,
2 chipped stone tools, 3 ground stone
artifacts, and 442 prehistoric ceramic
sherds. Also recovered were 27 pieces of
burned clay, 10 faunal bone fragments,
and 4.18 g of carbonized botanical
remains. Appendix A contains metric
data for the stone tools.
Debitage
The 14 pieces of unmodified
debitage consist of 4 gravel chert, 2
silicified wood, 1 jasper, 5 hematite, and
2 chert of unknown origin, reflecting
reliance on locally available stone
sources. Flake types present include
1 bending flake, 2 conchoidal flakes, 1
pressure flake, 1 punch flake, 2 flakes
with dorsal polish (i.e., hoe/adze/celt
flakes), 5 indeterminate flake fragments,
and 2 pieces of shatter.

an unmodified angular fragment, the
distal end has been retouched by
either marginal pressure flaking or
accumulative use wear as a drill or perforator. The second implement is a tabular
fragment of ferruginous sandstone that has been percussion retouched into a thick
uniface (Figure 4.10b). All edges exhibit almost 90-degree percussion retouch, and
the tool resembles a convex-end uniface. The dorsal surface has a patch of weathered
orange-stained cortex, and the bottom surface may have remnant abrasive wear as
part of a larger slab or grinding implement. No evidence of hafting was observed.
Ground Stone Tools
Three ground stone implements are a hammerstone, a pitted stone, and
an indeterminate fragment. The hammerstone is an elongated fragment of dense
silicified wood with an angular transverse break at one end. The opposing end is

broken similarly, but the edges and portions of the adjacent faces have light to
moderate battering and wear facets from use as a hammerstone. The second artifact
is a massive angular fragment of ferruginous sandstone. The upper surface has
two pitted areas with roughened interiors (Figure 4.10c). The better-defined pit is
about 30 mm in diameter and 6 mm in depth. The second pit is irregular in shape
and about 4 mm deep. The roughened and battered appearance of the pits suggests
that this artifact functioned as an anvil for tasks like bipolar percussion. The final
specimen is a small spall from a polished hematite artifact of indeterminate function.
Ceramic Sherds
The vessel ceramics recovered from 41RK693 consist of 442 sherds, which
weigh 1,189.5 g. Of these, 197 (940.4 g) are greater than 1.5 cm in diameter and
form the analyzed sample. This sample is 79 percent of the total ceramic recovery
by weight. The vast majority of these sherds are tempered with grog alone (n = 164,
83 percent). Nineteen sherds (10 percent) have grog and bone; 3 sherds (2 percent)
have grog, bone, and voids indicative of leached bone; 9 sherds (5 percent) have grog
and hematite; and single sherds have bone and indeterminate temper. The sample
consists of vessel body sherds (n = 170, 86 percent), a carinated body sherd (n = 1,
<1 percent), rim sherds (n = 15, 8 percent), neck sherds (n = 5, 3 percent), and base
sherds (n = 6, 3 percent). Generally, these sherds are no greater than 5 cm across,
and the majority are too small to be used to distinguish vessel form. Still, 5 bottle
sherds were noted, identified by their scraped interiors, along with 2 smoking pipe
fragments. The pipe sherds consist of 1 bowl rim and a stem section (Figure 4.11a–b).
Although small, the bowl fragment is suggestive of Early Caddo pipes recovered
from the George C. Davis site (Newell and Krieger 1949:Figure 53n). The vessel
rims and the single carinated body sherd indicate that bowls, bottles, and jars were
used at the site. The body and rim sherds range in thickness from 4.33 to 9.58 mm
(mean = 6.57 mm, standard deviation = 1.09). The bases are 9.05 to 12.12 mm thick,
with half at or thicker than 11.6 mm. Bases are flat (n = 4), rounded (n = 1), or
indeterminate (n = 1). Rim orientation is generally everted (n = 12), with 1 straight
rim and 2 rims indeterminate as to orientation (Figure 4.11c–f). One slightly everted
rim is from a long-necked bottle with a rounded lip (see Figure 4.11c). Lips are
mainly rounded (n = 5) or rolled (n = 4), although flat (n = 3), tapered (n = 2), and
indeterminate (n = 1) forms are also present.
The majority of the sherds are weathered on both the exterior and interior
surfaces, and many show scrapes that may be modern plow damage. Still, the
majority of both interior and exterior surfaces appear well smoothed (n = 135 and
138, respectively). Burnishing is the only other major surface finish, represented on
50 interior surfaces and 57 exterior surfaces. Seven interior surfaces are scraped,
and 5 are of indeterminate finish, as is 1 exterior surface. A single exterior surface
is textured (i.e., brushed).
Decorated sherds make up 30 percent (n = 60) of the sample. Most are mainly
incised or engraved (n = 24 and 17, respectively), which together make up 68 percent
of all decorated sherds. Sherds with punctations (n = 10), incising with punctations
(n = 8), and brushing-punctating-incising (n = 1) constitute the remainder. The

single sherd with brushing also has punctations and an incised line (Figure 4.12a).
Elements identified on the incised and engraved sherds include rectilinear lines,
diagonal lines, horizontal lines, curvilinear lines, hatching, and one example of a
pendant triangle. Elements with punctations include a line of punctations, a field
of punctations, and single punctations. Tool-made punctations are common to this
sample rather than fingernail punctations or pinching.
Most of these elements cannot be associated with any particular motif,
making it difficult to relate these decorated sherds to known types. For instance,
not enough of the engraved pendant triangle design remains to identify it positively,
although one could assume it is from a Ripley Engraved bottle due to the sherd’s
curvature and scraped interior (Figure 4.12b). The few motifs that were identified
include diagonal lines at the rim (n = 1), zoned diagonal lines (n = 1), and zoned
punctations (n = 3) (Figure 4.12c–f).

sherd; (b) bottle body sherd with engraved pendant triangle element; (c) incised body sherd with zoned diagonal
lines motif; (d–f) body sherds with zoned punctations motif.

Ceramic types that could be associated with these motifs and elements
include a range of both Early and Late Caddo types. For example, the diagonal
lines at the rim motif could be associated with either Canton Incised or later
Maydelle Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962:23–24, 103–104). The single sherd with
the zoned diagonal lines motif may be associated with Dunkin Incised (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:37–38), while the sherds with the zoned punctations motif and those
with field of punctations elements could represent early types such as Crockett
Curvilinear Incised, Dunkin Incised, or Pennington Punctated-Incised (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:31–34, 37–38, 121–122). Conversely, the sherd with engraved pendant
triangle and the single sherd with brushing are likely to be later.
Perhaps most telling, though, is the very low incidence of brushing
(<1 percent) and low overall incidence of decoration (30 percent). Both figures are
much lower than those for the Pine Tree Mound site (51 and 67 percent; Fields and
Gadus 2012:470) and even the Oak Hill Village site (10 and 51 percent; Rogers and
Perttula 2004:210, 283). These are the two best-dated Caddo sites in the region,

67

68

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
with the former being mostly Late Caddo and the latter mostly Middle Caddo. The
percentages for 41RK693 suggest that its primary component is earlier than those
two sites, although the radiocarbon dates listed below argue convincingly that it
dates to the Middle Caddo period.
Burned Clay
Twenty-seven pieces of burned clay (157.32 g) were recovered. None exhibit
clear grass or stick impressions to indicate they are from burned daub structures.
Little can be said regarding these small fragments (<3 cm diameter), other than that
they appear to coincide with the prehistoric cultural material at the site. The largest
specimen, found in Level 3 of Test Unit 6, is a clay ball fragment weighing 132.27 g
with a diameter of 6.5 cm. Clay balls have been found in earth oven features at
sites in the southeastern United States, presumably where rocks were not available
(Lorrain 2012:32). Hudgins (1993) has demonstrated the effectiveness of using clay
balls for roasting meat and tubers in earthen pits, noting that their heat-retention
properties make them a more effective cooking method than coals alone.
Faunal Remains
The faunal bone assemblage consists of two specimens from Test Unit 6
(Level 3) and eight specimens from Test Unit 9 (Levels 2–7). All are burned mammal
bones of indeterminate taxa, except for one specimen from Level 5 of Test Unit 9,
which is an unburned medipodial epiphasis of an artiodactyl, such as a deer.
Carbonized Botanical Remains
Four hand-excavated carbonized botanical specimens from Feature 1 and
Levels 4, 6, and 7 of Test Unit 9 and two flotation samples from Feature 1 were sent
to Macrobotanical Analysis prior to radiocarbon dating (see Appendix B). Identified
plants include corn cob and kernel fragments, hickory and walnut nutshells, a
purslane seed, cherry pits, and hickory, pine, oak, and grape wood.

Feature 1 and two from Test Unit 9
(see Appendix C). Carbonized hickory
nutshell fragments from Test Unit 9
as well as corn and nutshell fragments
from Feature 1 in Test Unit 4 all
indicate a Middle Caddo occupation
of the site, overlapping mostly in the
a . d . 1300s (Table 4.6). Based on the
CALIB radiocarbon calibration program
(Rev7.1.0; Stuiver et al. 2015), the early

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
and late ranges for five of the six dates with multiple ranges have nearly equal
probabilities; for the sixth (Beta-402623), the early range (a.d. 1295–1370; p = 0.71)
has a higher probability than the later one (a.d. 1380–1415; p = 0.29).
Summary and Conclusions
Site 41RK693 occupies an interfluve atop the valley wall on the south side
of the Cherokee Bayou floodplain. Four trenches and 10 test units were used to
investigate this 1,900-m2 area. The excavations yielded a sizeable collection of 442
prehistoric ceramic sherds and a small collection of 19 lithic artifacts. The ceramic
artifact density (39.6/m2) is the highest among the seven tested sites, and the lithic
density (1.8/m2) is the lowest.
The excavations identified only one cultural feature (a pit, at 38–48 cm
below the surface), probably because most of the site contains moderately thick
upland sands where matrix-supported features such as postholes and pits have a
low likelihood of survival and recognition, given the nature of the sediments and
the degree of bioturbation. All of the test units reached the Eocene substrate at
depths of 40–90 cm, with the average being 75 cm. Most artifacts were found at
10–90 cm; there are no indications in their vertical distributions that they could be
segregated into components. Most of the sherds (98 percent) are generally evenly
distributed between 10 and 90 cm, whereas most of the lithic artifacts (88 percent)
are at 10–70 cm.
Seven radiocarbon dates were obtained, five from Feature 1 and two from
nonfeature contexts. All of them indicate a Middle Caddo occupation in the a.d. 1300s.
None of the ceramic sherds can be typed positively, with the more-distinctive of the
decorative elements being common on a range of both Early and Late Caddo types
(and thus perhaps at home in a Middle Caddo context?). However, the incidences of
brushing (<1 percent) and overall decoration (30 percent) are lower than expected
for this time period based on the evidence from the Oak Hill Village site not far to
the southwest (Rogers and Perttula 2004:210, 283). The percentages for 41RK693
could suggest that it predates Oak Hill Village, which was occupied mainly at
a.d. 1150–1450, but the radiocarbon dates argue otherwise. The site yielded no
temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts that would help resolve this question. Given
the vagaries of typing collections of mostly small sherds such as that from 41RK693,
it probably is safer to rely on the radiocarbon dates than the ceramic evidence when
assessing the chronology of the site.
Site 41RK693 appears to be mostly a Middle Caddo residential site, probably
a farmstead. The fact that no midden is present suggests that its use in this way
occurred over a relatively short time. The paucity of preserved cultural features
means that this site has a low capacity to contribute important information about this
kind of Caddo occupation. The artifacts, botanical remains, and dates generated by
this project are instructive about the age and likely function of the site, but without
a preserved feature assemblage the site cannot provide information about farmstead
spatial organization. With this limitation, 41RK693 is considered ineligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places.

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
site 41RK695
Setting
Site 41RK695 is on the north end of a well-defined interfluve at an elevation
of 270–285 ft above mean sea level, ca. 1.2 km south of the Cherokee Bayou valley
wall. The interfluve is at the confluence of two small streams that merge and flow
north to Cherokee Bayou (Figure 4.13). The floodplain beyond the confluence widens
to about 100 m. The interfluve overlooks this confluence and a wetland to the east.
The central portion of the site has short grasses within a small clearing and is
surrounded by deciduous hardwood forest with an open understory. Disturbances
include active animal burrow­ing, slope erosion, vegetation clearing, and an active
all-terrain-vehicle trail that runs along the interfluve summit. There is an inhabited
residence on the same landform south of the site along the county road.
Previous Investigation
Site 41RK695 was first recorded in 2012 during survey of the Rusk Permit’s
Area W (Dockall et al. 2014). Thirteen shovel tests were excavated; 5 of which
contained cultural materials. The recovered assemblage consists of four plain ceramic
sherds, one pitted stone, one complete flake, one proximal flake fragment, two medial
flake fragments, and a piece of lithic shatter. In addition, six small pieces of possible
fire-cracked rock were found in a shovel test at the south end of the site. All artifacts
were recovered in the upper 25 cm. The site was recommended for testing because
the setting and the low artifact density suggest that it might be a campsite related
to resource procurement or processing activities, and with the surface sands being
less than 40 cm thick, it could con­tain preserved matrix-defined features such as
postholes and pits. Furthermore, the four plain prehistoric ceramic sherds might
indicate an Early Caddo component con­nected to the Hudnall-Pirtle site. It is the
only site recorded in the uplands during the survey that had the potential to contain
an interpretable Caddo component.
Work Accomplished
Test excavations consisted of manual excavation of 1x1-m test units and
mechanical trench excavation by backhoe. Trenches and test units were placed across
the top of the landform at regular intervals to the extent allowed by the vegetation.
Test units also were placed inside the treeline to explore areas not accessible by the
backhoe in the hope that the forested portion of the site might be less disturbed and
eroded than the central clearing. Five trenches and eight test units were excavated.
The trenches varied from 6 to 10 m in length, with an average of 8.3 m. Trench
depth varied from 0.3 to 0.6 m, with an average of 0.4 m. Trench excavations totaled
42 m2. The eight test units varied between 0.2 and 0.7 m in depth with an average
of 0.4 m. A total of 3.25 m3 of sediment were removed and screened.
Site Sediments
Soils are mapped as Latex very fine sandy loam (Griffith 2000:58). These are
very deep, moderately well-drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy

of dark grayish brown to yellowish brown fine sandy loam overlying 8–50 cm of pale
brown to yellowish brown fine sandy loam; these are A and E horizons developed
in sediments freed up by weathering of the underlying Eocene deposits. The strong
brown to yellowish red clayey Bt horizon developed in these Eocene deposits was
reached between 15 and 60 cm below the surface. The surface sands are thickest in
the center of the site in Test Units 1, 3, 5, and 6.
Site Extent and Depth
Artifacts were recovered from all eight test units and one trench, confirming
that the site extends across the interfluve summit and onto its upper slopes (Table
4.7). Artifact densities are very low (1–7/m2, 4.1/m2 overall) in seven of the eight
units, with only Test Unit 6 on the east-central edge of the site having a higher
density (7 lithics and 23 sherds). Artifacts are most abundant in Level 2, followed
by Level 3, which is not surprising given the thinness of the sands.

Note: Only half of Level 7 in Test Unit 1 was excavated. Artifacts from other proveniences consist of 1 sherd and
1 hematite axe fragment from Trench 3.

Cultural Features
No cultural features were identified in any of the test units or trenches.
Materials Recovered
The recovered artifact assemblage consists of 1 core, 30 pieces of unmodified
debitage, 2 chipped stone tools, 1 ground stone fragment, and 27 prehistoric ceramic
sherds. Appendix A contains metric data for the stone tools. No carbonized botanical
remains were recovered, so no radiocarbon dates were obtained.
Cores and Debitage
The single core is a small (33.3 mm) bipolar split pebble of locally procured
gravel chert. An internal fracture in the material prevented further reduction.
The small debitage sample consists overwhelmingly of local gravel chert,
gravel quartzite, and silicified wood (n = 26; 87 percent). Three flakes (10 percent) are
of unknown-origin quartzite, and one flake (3 percent) is of nonlocal white chert. The

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
distribution of flake types by size grade indicates that lithic reduction was oriented
toward tool finishing or maintenance and very little core reduction (Table 4.8).

Chipped Stone Tools
A complete Gary variety LeFlore dart point (Schambach 1998) was recovered
(Figure 4.14a). The specimen was manufactured of local gravel chert or jasper. The
blade edges appear to have been shaped by a combination of percussion and punch
techniques. One edge is convex, and the other is concave. Stem edges are concave
and contract to a convex base. Shoulders are curved but prominent. Stem edges
appear to be ground smooth.
A tabular fragment of ferruginous sandstone has bifacial percussion flaking
around most of its circumference (Figure 4.14b). One face has remnants of naturally
weathered exterior cortex. Intensive battering and blunting wear along the retouched
edge indicate that this implement was used to chop and cut hard material or was
heavily used and not resharpened. Such implements also may have been used in
shaping and surfacing a variety of ground stone implements like manos, metates,
slabs, axes, and celts.
Ground Stone Tool
The proximal end of a grooved hematite axe appears to have broken behind
the groove, and thus this item may represent a haft break during use (Figure 4.14c).
All exterior surfaces were initially percussion flaked and then smoothed and polished.
The ends of the fragment are battered and fractured from apparent secondary use
as an impromptu hammerstone. High spots on the fracture face are also somewhat
smooth from use or grinding to produce powdered pigment.
Ceramics
Of the 27 (159.9 g) ceramic vessel sherds recovered, 22 are greater than
1.5 cm in diameter and thus of analyzable size. None of the sherds is larger than
5 cm across. The sample consists of 19 body sherds, 1 neck sherd, and 2 base sherds.
The majority are tempered with grog (n = 19), although bone (n = 1), grog and
bone (n = 1), and grog and hematite (n = 1) are also present. Most sherds display a

smoothed surface finish. However, burnishing occurs on one exterior and one interior
surface, and texturing in the form of brushing was noted on two exterior surfaces.
The neck and body sherds range in thickness from 5.18 to 9.52 mm. No rims were
recovered, but the neck sherd suggests a vessel with an everted rim. The 2 bases
are flat and may be from the same vessel, as both are light brown in color with a
gray core and both are grog tempered. These base sherds are 10.21 and 10.37 mm
thick. In general, sherds in the sample have light brown or reddish yellow exteriors
and gray or black cores.
Only four sherds are decorated; two are brushed, and two are incised. The
brushed sherds are small body fragments, and both are bone tempered with voids.
One appears to be cross brushed, and the other has an indeterminate brushing
orientation. The incised sherds have rectilinear or horizontal lines from which motifs
cannot be distinguished. A single deeply incised horizontal line is on the interior of
the neck sherd (Figure 4.15a). Caddo vessels with single interior lines demarcating
the near-rim are not common, but examples do occur, such as six Ripley Engraved
carinated bowls with interior lines from the Titus phase Thomas B. Caldwell site,
41TT6. The second incised sherd has intersecting horizontal and vertical lines on
the exterior that could be part of a scroll motif, although this is not certain (Figure
4.15b).

were recovered.
Summary and Conclusions
Site 41RK695 is in an upland setting, 1.2 km south of the Cherokee Bayou
valley wall, on an interfluve between two small streams that merge and flow north
to Cherokee Bayou. Five trenches and eight test units were used to investigate this

75

76

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
1,250-m2 area. The excavations yielded a small collection of 27 prehistoric ceramic
sherds and 34 lithic artifacts. The ceramic artifact density (3.3/m2) is low, as is the
lithic artifact density (4.1/m2).
The excavations identified no cultural features, in spite of the fact that this
is the only tested site where the sands are consistently thin enough that matrixsupported features such as postholes and pits could be expected to survive and be
recognized. This suggests that few, if any, such features are present. All of the test
units reached the Eocene substrate, with the average depth being 41 cm. Artifacts
were found at depths of 0–60 cm, with 94 percent of the lithics and 88 percent of
the ceramics at 0–40 cm; there are no indications in their vertical distributions that
they could be segregated into components.
No radiocarbon dates were obtained, as no materials suitable for dating
were recovered. The ceramic artifacts are not very diagnostic, but the fact that two
of the sherds are brushed indicates that at least some of the materials date to the
Late Caddo period. The single Gary dart point, found at a depth of 30–40 cm, could
be consistent with a Caddo period occupation, but it is more often considered to
indicate Woodland or Late Archaic occupation.
Site 41RK695 is hard to interpret because of the paucity of remains. Judging
from the scant artifacts found and its setting, it may be a place where a Late
Caddo group, for example, the one that lived at 41RK674, camped while procuring
or processing some unknown upland resource. The absence of preserved cultural
features and datable materials and the inability to segregate the artifacts into
components (or to determine if more than one component is present) means that the
site has a low capacity to contribute important information. The artifacts generated
by this project are minimally instructive about the age and possible function of the
site, but without features the site cannot provide any information about site spatial
organization. With this limitation, 41RK695 is considered ineligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places.
site 41RK703
Setting
Site 41RK703 sits at elevations of 240–245 ft atop an elongated series of
rises less than 1 m high on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain (Figure 4.16). These rises
appear to be remnants of a low Pleistocene or Holocene terrace. On the south end
is a crescent-shaped rise adjacent to a gas well pad. It is separated from the larger
northern rise by a series of small interconnected sloughs, a gas well road, and a
large pipeline corridor with multiple lines. The northern rise, which is slightly lower
than the southern one, continues for about 340 m to Cherokee Bayou. The eastern
edge of the site abuts a densely vegetated area along a small unnamed tributary.
All of the floodplain from the site westward was cleared of large trees, with the
exception of some scattered cypresses and oaks, between 2005 and 2009; the area
now is vegetated in short grasses and water-tolerant plants. Portions of the surface
have been lightly tilled and planted in rye grass, and surface depressions on the
eastern third of the site appear to have been filled in and leveled using light-colored

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
sand prior to grass planting. Other disturbances include animal burrowing, periodic
flooding and erosion, cattle trampling, logging and tree removal, and construction
of the gas well pad, access road, and multiple pipelines. The logging and gas well
activities were particularly damaging.
Previous Investigations
The site was first recorded in 2012 during survey of the Rusk Permit’s
Area W (Dockall et al. 2014). Forty-seven shovel tests were excavated; 25 tests were
positive for prehistoric materials. The artifact assemblage consists of 62 pieces
of lithic debitage, 1 flake tool, 1 distal biface or projectile point fragment, and 1
piece of worked ochre. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered. Additional work was
recommended to assess the age, context, and integrity of the site and to determine
if it is associated with the Early Caddo ceremonial center at the Hudnall-Pirtle site
to the northeast.
Work Accomplished
Testing involved manual excavation of 1x1-m test units and mechanical
excavation by backhoe. Excavation focused on the two topographic highs, avoiding
inundated areas and the wide pipeline corridor that bisects the site. Twenty-five test
units (1x1 m) and 23 backhoe trenches were excavated; 15 test units and 9 trenches
were in the south part of the site, and 10 units and 14 trenches were in the north
part. Trenches varied from 8 to 10 m in length, with an average of 9.8 m. Trench
depth varied from 0.5 to 1.2 m and averaged 0.8 m. Trench excavations totaled
226 m2. The test units varied between 0.5 and 1.3 m in depth with an average of
0.9 m; 21.9 m3 of sediment were removed and screened. Seventeen test units were
terminated due to inundation. Test Unit 12 was terminated because of a pipeline
at 0.5 m below the surface.
Site Sediments
Soils are mapped as frequently flooded Laneville loam (Griffith 2000). These
are very deep, moderately well-drained soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium
on floodplains draining mainly the Wilcox Formation. However, the sandy sediments
encountered in testing indicate that the sediments are more appropriately classed
as Iulus fine sandy loam or Owentown fine sandy loam, which occur as small areas
within larger zones of Laneville loam (Griffith 2000).
The typical soil profile in the south part of the site consists of 10–25 cm of
dark grayish brown to brown sandy loam overlying yellowish brown to brown sandy
loam. The water table was encountered between 50 and 130 cm on the south end
of the site. In the north part, the typical soil profile consists of 10–35 cm of brown
sandy clay loam overlying yellowish brown sandy loam to depths of 55 to 100 cm
before encountering water or saturated sediments. Pale brown and dark yellowish
brown mottles are common in the sediments just above the water table, suggesting
the soils are frequently inundated. Disturbances from burning during land clearing
and leveling prior to planting are common in the northern trenches, and krotovina

and small roots are common across the entire site. A well-defined argillic horizon
was not encountered in any of the test units or trenches. The sediments exposed
in the excavations appear to represent Pleistocene or Holocene alluvium based on
their position on the landscape, but no depositional structures indicative of intact
stratigraphy were observed, presumably because of thorough bioturbation.
Site Extent and Depth
Artifacts were recovered from all but one of the test units and eight of the
trenches, indicating that cultural materials are scattered widely across the two rises
(Tables 4.9 and 4.10). The overall artifact density is 53.4 items per m2, but artifacts
are much more abundant in the south part of the site (76.2/m2) than the north part
(19.3/m2), perhaps reflecting the more-elevated position (and hence more favorable
for occupation) of the former. Artifacts were found through the full thickness of the
tested deposits in both areas (0–130 cm in the south and 0–80 cm in the north);
they are most frequent at 20–90 cm on the south rise and 10–70 cm on the north
rise. Due to the absence of any discernible alluvial stratigraphy, it is unlikely that
these distributions are very meaningful.

Cultural Features
Two cultural features were excavated. Both are burned rock concentrations
in the south part of the site. A third potential burned rock feature was encountered
at 70 cm below the surface in the base of Trench 8 (also in the south part), but the
saturated sediments prevented its excavation.

Note: Artifacts from other proveniences consist of 1 core and 3 ground stones from Trench 13.

Feature 1 is a small cluster of burned rocks encountered at 55 cm below
the surface in Test Unit 1 (Figure 4.17a). The feature consists of seven thermally
altered hematitic sandstone rocks in an amorphous cluster extending to 63 cm
below the surface. The cluster has maximum dimensions of 40 cm north-south by
50 cm east-west. Charcoal flecks, a piece of debitage, and a drill were found among
the rocks and could be associated with the feature. Feature 1 is interpreted as
a disarticulated hearth. Two carbonized botanical remains recovered from hand
excavation and flotation samples were sent for identification prior to radiocarbon
dating (see Appendix B). Both were identified as oak wood (Quercus sp.). Radiocarbon
assays on them returned two-sigma calibrated dates in the Middle Archaic period
(see Radiocarbon Dates).
Feature 2 is a cluster of burned rocks first encountered at ca. 40 cm below
the surface in Trench 4. Test Unit 13 was excavated on the west wall of Trench 4
to document it. Feature 2 consists of an amorphous cluster of thermally altered
hematitic sandstone. The maximum horizontal dimensions are 70 cm southwestnortheast by 60 cm northwest-southeast. The feature extends from 38 to 50 cm below
the surface. Feature 2 is interpreted as a disarticulated hearth. No soil staining or
charcoal flecking was observed during excavation, but small amounts of carbonized
plant remains were recovered from flotation samples (see Appendix B). One sample
was submitted for identification prior to radiocarbon dating and was identified as
hickory nutshell (Carya sp.). The sample returned a two-sigma calibrated date of
in the Middle Archaic period (see Radiocarbon Dates).
Materials Recovered
Artifacts recovered from 41RK703 consist of 2 cores, 1,307 pieces of debitage,
35 chipped stone tools, 19 ground stone tools, 2 possible manuports, and 5 prehistoric
ceramic sherds. Other materials recovered are 92 faunal bone fragments and 3.46 g
of carbonized botanical remains. Appendix A contains metric data for the lithic tools.

Cores and Debitage
One of the two gravel chert cores
represents an attempt to reduce a small
(35.9 mm) stream-worn chert pebble by
bipolar percussion. The other is a larger
(65.2 mm) percussion core of gray-green
chert with stream-worn cortex. Both
materials are representative of locally
available chert resources.
Of the 1,307 pieces of unmodified
debitage, 1,300 pieces were included in
the detailed analysis. Two pieces of
microdebitage from Feature 1 and 5
a
pieces from Feature 2 were not included
because they are very small. Locally
available raw materials make up
57 percent of the sample (344 gravel
chert, 98 gravel quartzite, 105 silicified
wood, 185 hematite, 7 siltstone, and
4 ferruginous sandstone), nonlocal
materials are 28 percent (237 Edwards
chert, 6 Burlington-Keokuk-Elsey
chert, 23 black chert, 84 gray chert,
and 18 white chert), and materials
from unknown sources are 15 percent.
Nonlocal materials, chiefly Edwards
chert, are more prominent in this
b
collection than in those from other
tested sites in the Rusk Permit area.

the two smallest size grades, reflecting
the use of small local raw materials
and a focus on tool maintenance rather
than tool manufacture; this is also indicated in the distribution of flake types by
size grade (Table 4.11). The abundance of hematite debitage and hematite flakes
with polish indicate that the manufacture and maintenance of ground stone tools
like grooved axes (or hoes/adzes/celts) was conducted at the site. Very little of the
debitage (n = 136, 10 percent), almost all of it from local sources, exhibits any amount
of exterior cortex.
Chipped Stone Tools
The 35 chipped stone tools consist of 4 arrow points, 14 dart points, 12 bifaces,
2 unifaces, 2 drills, and 1 heavy chopper.

arrow points
The arrow point sample is small and is represented by three specimens of
the Friley type and an untyped preform. Two of the Friley points are complete, and
one is a distal-medial fragment without the stem (Figure 4.18a–c). All are chert
from unknown sources, but most likely locally available. None are heat treated. The
complete Friley points are reworked distally, whereas the distal-medial fragment
has finely serrated blade edges.
The untyped preform is an Edwards chert flake with marginal edge nibbling
and light pressure retouch on the edges (Figure 4.18d). Rudiments of a contracting
stem are present, and blade edges are recurved. There is no indication of heat
treatment. It could be placed within any number of arrow point styles such as
Friley, Catahoula, and Steiner but is considered a preform because it is unfinished.
dart points
Identified dart point styles are Gary, Ellis, Trinity, and Wells. One complete
dart point is untyped. A series of untypeable fragments were also recovered.
Two heavily resharpened examples of Gary points were obtained (Figure
4.18e–f). Each was manufactured from locally available gravel cherts. The blades
on both are considerably shortened due to resharpening, making them roughly as
long as the stems. Shoulders on each point are slight but present, and one retains
cortex on the basal edge. Stems on both are contracting and have convex lateral
and basal edges.
Three Ellis dart points were recovered (Figure 4.18g–i). One is manufactured
of Edwards chert, one of quartzite, and one of unknown-source chert. All have
expanding stems, corner notches, and prominent barbs. Blade edges and basal edges
are convex. The specimen of unknown chert has finely serrated blade edges. The
blade edges of the Edwards chert specimen may have been resharpened.

preform; (e–f) Gary dart points; (g–i) Ellis dart points; (f) Trinity dart point; (k) Wells dart point stem; (l) untyped

A Trinity point of gravel quartzite has an expanding stem with broad
and shallow side notches and slight shoulders (Figure 4.18j). The basal edge is
irregular. The blade edges may have been resharpened. The single Wells specimen
is represented by a quartzite stem fragment with very well-ground lateral edges
(Figure 4.18k). The stem was broken in a bending fracture.
One dart point is untyped (Figure 4.18l). It is of silicified wood and has convex
lateral blade edges, very shallow side notches, and a straight basal edge. The stem
appears side notched but is so short it is difficult to determine accurately. Notches
and the basal edge are lightly ground. It is reminiscent in shape of styles such as
Trinity and Yarbrough.
Six untypeable dart point fragments consist of three proximal and three
distal portions. One proximal fragment is nonlocal gray chert, one is local gravel
chert, and one is an unknown-source chert. All exhibit bending fractures and
represent haft breaks, likely during impact or manufacture. The gray chert fragment
is a portion of a contracting stem with a convex basal edge, and the unknown-source
chert stem exhibits parallel edges and a convex basal edge. Basal grinding is not
present on any fragment. All three distal fragments are quartzite. Two exhibit

transverse bending fractures due to distal impact breakage, and one has thermal
damage. None of these quartzites appear to be the type common in local gravels.
bifaces
The single bifacial knife is a small, heavily retouched, complete tool
manufactured of unknown-source quartzite (Figure 4.19a). Blade and basal edges
are convex, and the biface is ovate to lanceolate in shape. The single complete Stage
1 ovate biface is of gravel chert. The five Stage 2 bifaces are of silicified wood (n = 2),
gravel chert (n = 2), and gravel quartzite (n = 1). One is complete, one is a proximal
fragment, one is a proximal-medial fragment, and two are distal fragments. Break
types consist of three snap/end shock, one material flaw, and one perverse fracture.
All appear to have been broken or abandoned during manufacture, and only one
exhibits deliberate heat treatment. Although it is difficult to assess the intended final
end products, the proximal-medial fragment is a roughly triangular to oval preform
with a mix of both direct and indirect (punch) percussion flake scars (Figure 4.19b).
The single Stage 3 and Stage 4 bifaces are small distal fragments manufactured of
unknown-source chert and quartzite. Both have snap/end shock fractures and could
have been broken either during use or manufacture. Indeterminate biface fragments
consist of one medial portion and two unidentified fragments. One is silicified wood,
one is Edward chert (possible Georgetown), and one is white chert. The silicified
wood medial fragment exhibits significant thermal damage.

chert, and luster suggests heat treatment (Figure 4.19c). It was manufactured on a
thick conchoidal percussion flake. The convex end has been retouched by marginal
percussion and possibly pressure flaking. Lateral edges are minimally trimmed. The
second uniface was manufactured from a bending percussion flake and has pronounced
edge rounding and smoothing on the convex end (Figure 4.19d). A slight spur is present
at the left edge of the distal end. While considerably retouched, both specimens exhibit
surface polish and lateral edge smoothing from hafting. Reasons for discard could not
be determined, but both may have been functionally exhausted by retouch.
Two implements are drills. One is a small triangular gravel chert flake with
marginal pressure flaking (Figure 4.19e). The distal end appears to have light drill
wear. The other is a stemmed, well-made bifacial drill; it appears to be have been
reworked from a Plainview or other similar type of dart point (Figure 4.19f). Raw
material is Edwards chert. The base is widely flaring with a concave basal edge and
straight short lateral edges and remnant basal grinding.
The final chipped stone tool is a dense hematite mass that has been roughly
percussion flaked on the ends and one edge. This implement functioned as a heavy
chopping tool based on the degree of wear, battering, and step fractures along the
retouched edges.
Ground Stone Tools
There are 19 ground stone artifacts: 1 anvil, 1 pitted stone, 6 hammerstones,
1 mano, 1 fragmentary grooved axe, 3 axe fragments, 1 celt fragment, 4 polished
stones, and 1 pigment source. Also included under this heading are 2 manuports.
A heavy angular mass of tabular ferruginous sandstone and hematite
exhibits pitting, abrasion, and other wear associated with use of one surface as
an anvil support for a variety of tasks. None of the edges are percussion flaked or
otherwise trimmed to shape the piece.
The pitted stone is a piece of angular ferruginous sandstone (Figure 4.20).
This artifact functioned as a surface for such tasks as bipolar percussion, nut
shelling, or pigment crushing. Pits on both faces are rough and not smooth and were
apparently produced by smashing or crushing dense hard materials. One edge also
exhibits battering and crushing wear.
Two hammerstones are ferruginous sandstone, and four are hematite. The
sandstone specimens are both weathered pieces of material with surface and edge
battering and crushing. Three of the hematite specimens have evidence of percussion
flaking and surface smoothing and might represent reused tool fragments; the fourth
is a weathered mass with battering and associated surface scratches on one end.
The mano is a small end fragment of a larger hand mano manufactured of
ferruginous sandstone. Edges are battered from use, and surfaces are smooth from
grinding.
The relatively complete but damaged grooved axe and three other axe
fragments all were manufactured of hematite. The relatively complete axe has a

full groove (Figure 4.21a). All surfaces are well ground, smoothed, and polished. The
bit and blade have been damaged by impact and bending fractures characteristic of
use. A portion of the bit is still intact and has an edge or bit angle of 75 degrees. The
poll is complete. On one face at the groove is an elongated smoothed and polished
shallow depression. Two of the fragments represent broken poll ends of grooved axes.
One retains the full groove and represents a haft break just in front of the groove
(Figure 4.21b). The second example represents a haft break somewhere proximal
of the groove and has been used lightly as a hammerstone. The third axe fragment,
apparently recycled, is a chopper that exhibits some evidence of grinding and polish
on a face and side. The end has been bifacially percussion flaked and is blunted
and battered from use along the retouched edge and opposing end. This fragment

A possible hematite celt medial fragment exhibits bending or end shock
fractures on both ends (Figure 4.22a). This fragment is somewhat weathered but
retains portions of the original exterior ground and smoothed surface. The fragment
has a flattened oval cross section. This portion may represent a haft break.

Three pieces of hematite and one of silicified wood have at least one polished
surface or face. The hematite examples are small angular to subangular fragments
with one polished surface. It could not be determined if any were used as pigment
sources. Most likely they are small pieces of larger polished hematite artifacts. One
hematite artifact is an ovate tabular piece with both faces and all edges apparently
ground and polished, with much of the polished surfaces exfoliated; the function of
this artifact is undetermined. The example of silicified wood is a rod-shaped piece
with ends that have been shaped/ground as convex beveled faces (Figure 4.22b).
Some pitting and battering are present on the ends. It may have been used as a
punch for indirect percussion or as a small cylindrical hammerstone.

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
The single pigment source is a thin tabular piece of limonite or ocher with
an upper surface scratched and smoothed by abrasion (Figure 4.22c). The edges and
ridges appear slightly smoothed and polished from use.
Two quartzite pebbles are considered manuports, since they were probably
procured from some local gravel source and brought to the site. They may have been
gathered as part of raw material procurement events. Although their functions are
not known, similar materials probably were used as polishing stones for ceramic
vessel manufacture. There is no wear apparent on the surfaces of these pebbles.
Ceramic Vessel Sherds
Only five ceramic vessel sherds (36.2 g) were recovered. They range in size
from 1 to 6 cm across and are 4.92 to 8.17 mm thick. They consist of four body
sherds and one rim sherd. Temper is variable: one grog; one hematite; one grog and
hematite; and two grog, bone, and hematite. Surface finishes are either smoothed or
indeterminate due to erosion. Exterior surface colors are light brown, dark brown,
red, or gray, while cores are black, gray, or light brown.
The undecorated, grog-tempered rim has a straight orientation with a
rounded lip (Figure 4.23a). It is 4.92 mm thick and, though eroded, appears to have
been well smoothed both on the interior and exterior. It is suggestive of a bowl, but
it is too small to give an accurate rim diameter for the vessel it represents. The
single decorated body sherd is incised with rectilinear lines, but not enough of the
decoration is present to identify a motif or vessel form (Figure 4.23b). None of the
sherds can be associated with a ceramic type, but their general characteristics
Figure 4.23
suggest that they are Caddo made.
Faunal Remains
Ninety-two faunal bone fragments
were recovered. Sixty-seven are small burned
fragments of unidentified mammals. Most of
the 25 unburned specimens are from 0–20 cm
below the surface and are likely modern.

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
Radiocarbon Dates
Three radiocarbon dates were obtained from carbonized plant remains
recovered from Features 1 and 2. All three dates indicate that the site has a Middle
Archaic component. The two-sigma calibrated date ranges obtained on the samples
from Feature 1 are: 3305–3300, 3280–3275, 3265–3240, and 3105–2925 b.c. (Beta402625); and 3335–3210, 3190–3150, and 3140–3020 b.c. (Beta-402626). Based
on the CALIB radiocarbon calibration program (Rev7.1.0; Stuiver et al. 2015), the
latest range of the first date has a much higher probability (0.88) than the others,
while for the second date the earliest and latest ranges have higher probabilities
than the middle one (0.51 and 0.38 vs. 0.11). Assuming the two dates actually relate
to the same event, this implies that Feature 1 dates to around 3100–3000 b.c. The
two-sigma calibrated ranges for the sample from Feature 2 are 3635–3500 and
3430–3380 b.c. (Beta-402627), with the earlier range having a higher probability
than the later one (0.79 vs. 0.21). This suggests that Feature 2 predates Feature 1
by about 500 years.
Summary and Conclusions
Site 41RK703 occupies two adjacent rises on a low terrace on the floodplain
of Cherokee Bayou. Twenty-three trenches and 25 test units were used to investigate
these two areas, which together cover 26,500 m2. The excavations yielded a tiny
collection of 5 prehistoric ceramic sherds and a large collection of 1,365 lithic artifacts.
The ceramic artifact density (0.2/m2) is negligible, and the lithic density (53.5/m2)
is the second highest among the tested sites. Most of the artifacts (60 percent of
the ceramics and 86 percent of the lithics) are from the slightly higher and smaller
southern rise, and this is where Native Americans concentrated their activities.
The excavations identified two cultural features, both of them burned rock
concentrations, on the southern rise at depths of 38–50 and 55–63 cm; a third
possible burned rock concentration was found there at a depth of 70 cm but was not
excavated because it was in saturated sediments. The fact that no other features were
identified probably can be explained by the fact that the site is in thick homogeneous
alluvial sands where matrix-supported features such as postholes and pits have a
low likelihood of survival and recognition, given the nature of the sediments and
the degree of bioturbation. All of the test units were terminated without reaching
pre-Holocene deposits, often because of saturated sediments. The eight deepest units
reached 100–130 cm. On the southern rise, most of the lithic artifacts (83 percent)
were distributed generally evenly between 20 and 90 cm, with lower frequencies
above this and to a depth of 130 cm; the few sherds were at 40–60 cm. On the
northern rise, lithic artifacts were found at 0–80 cm, with 95 percent generally
evenly distributed between 10 and 70 cm; the two ceramic sherds were at 60–70 cm.
There are no indications in the vertical distributions of the artifacts that they could
be segregated into components.
Three radiocarbon dates on materials from the two excavated burned rock
concentrations indicate that the site has a Middle Archaic component, with one
feature apparently dating to ca. 3100–3000 b.c. and the other being about 500 years

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
older. The single Wells dart point from the southern rise may go with this component
but was found deeper (80–90 cm) than the features. The three Ellis dart points (all
from 60–70 cm) and single Trinity point (from 50–60 cm) from the southern rise
and the two Gary dart points (from 50–70 cm) from the northern rise likely are
later, representing occupations during the Late Archaic or Woodland periods, even
though they were found as deep as or deeper than the Middle Archaic features. Also
later are the three Friley arrow points from both rises (two from 10–30 cm and one
from 50–60 cm); these indicate occupation during the late part of the Woodland
period or the Early Caddo period. The very few ceramic sherds, recovered from both
parts of the site, are not diagnostic but are more consistent with Caddo wares than
Woodland ceramics.
Site 41RK703 appears to be a multicomponent site occupied during the
Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, probably Woodland, and probably Early Caddo
periods. Most of the cultural materials probably relate to the Archaic components,
which appear to represent repeated and relatively intensive use of the rise as a
general-purpose campsite. The post-Archaic occupations appear to have been more
ephemeral and may have been for nonresidential purposes. The paucity of preserved
cultural features and datable materials and the inability to segregate the artifacts
into components means that the site has a low capacity to contribute important
information. The artifacts and dates generated by this project are instructive about
the age and possible functions of the site, but without a preserved feature assemblage
the site cannot provide any information about spatial site organization. With this
limitation, 41RK703 is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places.
site 41RK704
Setting
Site 41RK704 sits atop a small isolated knoll at ele­vations of 245–250 ft
on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain; the knoll is 1–2 m higher than the surrounding
floodplain surface (Figure 4.24). The landform, which appears to have been created
by meandering of wet-weather drainages to the north, east, and west as flood waters
drained into Cherokee Bayou, likely is a low Pleistocene or Holocene terrace. This
section of the floodplain was cleared of large trees, with the exception of some
scattered cypresses and oaks, between 2005 and 2009; the area now is vegetated in
short grasses and water-tolerant plants. Logging is the most notable disturbance
factor, with others being erosion, pig rooting and cattle trampling, and construction
of a large gas pipeline along the northeast edge of the site.
Previous Investigations
Site 41RK704 was first recorded in 2012 during survey of Rusk Permit’s
Area W (Dockall et al. 2014). Nine shovel tests were excavated on and around the
small landform, and all six on the rise itself were positive for prehistoric cultural
materials. The assemblage consists of 7 small nonhuman bone fragments, 1 possible
Friley arrow point fragment, and 46 pieces of lithic debitage. Also recovered were

site to the northeast.

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
Work Accomplished
Testing consisted of manual excavation of 1x1-m test units and excavation
of backhoe trenches. Three backhoe trenches were excavated at 10 m intervals
across the top of the landform. The trenches were 8 m long and 1.3 m deep. Trench
excavations totaled 24 m2. Six test units were excavated to 1.3 m as well; 7.8 m3 of
sediment were removed and screened.
Site Sediments
Soils are mapped as Laneville loam, fre­quently flooded (Griffith 2000).
Laneville series soils consists of very deep, moderately well-drained soils formed
in loamy and clayey alluvium on floodplains draining mainly the Wilcox Formation
(Soil Survey Staff, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service 2009a). However, the deposits on this small rise are deep, very sandy, and very
well drained, though probably saturated during periods of high water, and they are
more appropriately classed as Iulus fine sandy loam or Owentown fine sandy loam,
which occur as small areas within larger zones of Laneville loam (Griffith 2000). A
typical soil profile consists of 110 to 120 cm of dark brown to dark yellowish brown
silty sand overlying wet mottled silty sand in colors ranging from pale brown to
dark yellowish brown. None of the excavations encountered an argillic horizon. The
sediments exposed appear to represent Pleistocene or Holocene alluvium based on
their position on the landscape, but no depositional structures indicative of intact
stratigraphy were observed, presumably because of thorough bioturbation.
Site Extent and Depth
The test excavations demonstrate that cultural materials are scattered across
the full extent of the knoll, with the site covering an area approximately 40 m northsouth by 20 m east-west. Prehistoric artifacts were found in all of the test units
and trenches (Table 4.12). Artifact densities in the test units average 195.6 per m2
but are especially high (403/m2) in Test Unit 5, which sampled Feature 1 (Levels
9–12). Outside of the feature, artifact densities are fairly consistent throughout
the vertical column between 10 and 110 cm, with slightly lower densities in the
uppermost and lowermost levels.
Cultural Features
Only one possible cultural feature was encountered. The feature was first
identified during excavation of Test Unit 4, and Test Unit 5 was excavated just to
the east to help investigate it. It was observed first in the north wall of Test Unit 4,
where the bottom of a zone of dark brown (10YR 2/2–3/3) sediments dipped down
from ca. 80 to 120 cm east to west into the underlying pale brown (10YR 6/3) sands
(Figure 4.25a). The dark brown sediments appeared to be organically enriched, but
not to the degree that they constitute a midden. The top of this zone, though difficult
to discern, began between 50 and 60 cm below the surface. Its lateral edges were
not evident in either Test Unit 4 or 5, and thus it extends beyond them. The north
wall of Test Unit 5 showed this zone dipping down to 120 cm below the surface to

extending as deep as 110 cm. Feature 1 may be a large shallow pit dug to serve an
unknown function, or it may simply reflect noncultural variation in the vertical
extent of the organically enriched sediments.
The two test units containing Feature 1 yielded more artifacts than any
other unit: 4 ceramic sherds, 1 core, 563 pieces of lithic debitage, 24 chipped stone

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
tools, 5 ground stone tools, 3 faunal bone fragments, and 68 g of carbonized botanical
remains. Diagnostic lithics are 1 Catahoula arrow point, 1 Cuney arrow point, 3
Friley arrow points, 4 Steiner arrow points, 1 Edgewood dart point, 1 Gary dart
point, and 1 Kent dart point.
Materials Recovered
The artifacts recovered from 41RK704 consist of 6 cores, 1,109 pieces of
debitage, 41 chipped stone tools, 15 ground stone tools, 2 possible manuports, and
15 prehistoric ceramic sherds. Also recovered were 3 faunal bone fragments and
75.88 g of carbonized botanical remains.
Cores and Debitage
Two of the cores are small (41.2 and 41.5 mm) cobble/pebble percussion cores
of gravel chert and jasper. The other four are small (19.6, 20.2, 36.8, and 47.6 mm)
bipolar cores, one of gravel quartzite and three of gravel chert. All are local materials.
The debitage assemblage consists of 1,109 pieces. Eleven of these are
microdebitage from Feature 1 and were not included in the detailed debris analysis
due to small size. 0f the 1,098 analyzed pieces, 88 percent are locally available raw
materials (671 gravel chert, 99 gravel quartzite, 81 silicified wood, 2 chalcedony,
106 hematite, and 4 ferruginous sandstone), 4 percent are nonlocal materials (19
Edwards chert, 1 Burlington-Keokuk-Elsey chert, 4 black chert, 13 gray chert, 9
white chert, and 1 Stanley-Jackfork sandstone), and 8 percent are materials from
unknown sources.
Almost all (97 percent) of the flakes are in the two smallest size grades,
reflecting the use of small local raw materials and a focus on tool maintenance rather
than tool manufacture; this is also indicated in the distribution of flake types by size
grade (Table 4.13). The presence of hematite debitage indicates that the manufacture
and maintenance of ground stone tools was conducted at the site. Cortical debris
is much more common in this assemblage (27 percent) than the comparably sized
one from 41RK703; this may signify differences in the technologies applied at the
two sites or reflect the greater use of local gravels at 41RK704.
Chipped Stone Tools
There are 41 chipped stone tools in the 41RK704 lithic assemblage: 16 arrow
points, 12 dart points, 12 bifaces, and 1 uniface.
arrow points
Arrow point styles include Catahoula, Cuney, Friley, and Steiner; untyped
and untypeable fragments and a preform also are present. The single Catahoula
is a complete, very well-made point made of jasper (Figure 4.26a). Blade edges are
straight to slightly concave and finely serrated. The stem is short and expanding
with a slightly concave basal edge. Shoulders and barbs are squared but prominent
and extend even with the basal edge. The blade may have been resharpened.

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
Both Cuney points are made of an unknown-source chert, although it might
be a variety of local gravel chert. One is complete, minus one barb, and another is a
proximal-medial fragment also missing one barb and probably broken during use
(Figure 4.26b–c). Lateral blade edges are straight to slightly recurved, and stems
are expanding with concave basal edges. Barbs and shoulders are pronounced and
flaring.
Of the five Friley points, three are complete, one is missing the tip, and one
is a distal-medial fragment (Figure 4.26d–f). Four are of gravel chert, and one is of
jasper. The use of locally available raw materials is characteristic of this point type.
All are considerably reworked distally and laterally, as was the case with Friley
points from 41RK562 nearby (Dockall and Fields 2011:70). Blade edges vary from
convex to concave/recurved due to resharpening. Without consideration of point
morphology and maintenance patterns observed at 41RK562, two specimens from
41RK704 could have been misidentified as Perdiz point proximal fragments.
The four Steiner points are three proximal-medial fragments and one
complete but heavily resharpened specimen (Figure 4.26g–h). One is of possible
siltstone, and three are of local gravel cherts. Blade edges have been reworked.
Stems are slightly expanding to rectangular, and intact shoulders flare outward.
The fragmented specimens broke during impact based on fracture patterns and
locations.
The single untyped arrow point is similar in form and appearance to such
styles as Catahoula, Cuney, and Steiner and may be a reworked version of one of
these small corner-notched forms (Figure 4.26i). The specimen is of gravel chert.
Blade edges are slightly concave with prominent shoulders, and the widely flaring
stem has a convex basal edge. Blade edges have been resharpened.
A complete small ovate pressure-flaked biface is tentatively identified
as an arrow point preform. Manufactured of silicified wood, the lateral edges
are irregular, but the basal edge is convex. The artifact was discarded during
manufacture.
There are two untypeable arrow point fragments. Both are distal fragments,
one relatively complete blade and one medial portion of a blade. The relatively
complete blade represents an early-stage manufacture failure, and the medial blade
portion has two end shock or snap fractures. Both are of gravel chert.
dart points
Identified styles of dart points are Edgewood, Gary, and Kent; untyped
specimens are present as well. The single Edgewood is a complete corner-notched
triangular point with an expanding stem and straight basal edge (Figure 4.26j).
Blade edges are straight but resharpened. Barbs are prominent. The raw material
is Edwards chert.
Of the seven Gary points, four are variety LeFlore, one is variety Gary, and
one is variety Camden (Schambach 1998); the seventh could not be attributed to a
specific variety. Two each are of gravel chert, gravel quartzite, and jasper, and one is

97

98

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
of silicified wood. All are complete except for one proximal-medial fragment with an
impact fracture. The variety LeFlore specimens have narrow to broad blades with
concave/recurved to slightly convex edges. Stems are typically short and narrow
and contracting, and shoulders are flaring (Schambach 1998:57) (Figure 4.26k–m).
They were manufactured by a combination of percussion and pressure flaking, each
having biconvex cross sections and one approaching a diamond-shaped cross section.
The variety Gary point is complete and exhibits a combination of percussion and
pressure retouch (Figure 4.26n). The blade edges are concave and resharpened;
the stem contracts to a convex base and has well-ground edges. A small amount of
cortex is present on one face. The blade is broad, and the shoulders are prominent
and pointed with concave stem edges (Schambach 1998:55). The variety Camden
point has a blade with edges that are convex and shoulders that are slight and
rounded (Figure 4.26o). The stem is gently contracting with convex lateral edges
and a rounded basal edge. The tip has an impact fracture.
The single complete Kent point, manufactured of unknown-source chert, has
a blade that has been reworked and is alternately beveled and assymetrical (Figure
4.26p). Blade edges are straight to slightly convex. The stem is slightly contracting
with remnant cortex on one face. Some cortex is also present on one face of the
blade indicating that this point was manufactured from a small chert cobble. The
basal edge is convex.
One of the three untypeable dart point fragments is a proximal-medial
section of an early-stage preform of Edwards chert. Remnant patches of unweathered
cortex are present on both faces. The stem is contracting and has cortex on the basal
edge. Shoulders are present and subangular and flaring. The blade was broken
in a snap or end shock fracture during manufacture. The second specimen is a
white chert proximal-medial fragment retaining one complete barb/shoulder and
a portion of the stem. This artifact may have broken during impact. The final dart
point fragment is a lateral edge blade portion of local gravel chert. It broke along
the blade edge as a result of impact.
bifaces
Two of the four Stage 1 bifaces are complete, and two are proximal fragments.
Two are of silicified wood, and two are gravel chert. Two were abandoned during
manufacture due to internal material flaws, and two exhibit snap/end shock fractures
and are manufacture-related failures. None are heat treated. Complete examples
are oval in general outline shape (Figure 4.27a).
One of the three Stage 2 bifaces is complete, one is a proximal-medial portion,
and one is a distal fragment. One is of gravel chert, one is of silicified wood, and
one is of chert from an unknown source. The complete gravel chert biface is oval in
shape and plano-convex in cross section (Figure 4.27b). This biface was abandoned
during manufacture due to an overthickened cross section that could not be thinned.
Flake scars suggest a combination of direct percussion and indirect percussion
(punch) techniques. The fragmentary Stage 2 bifaces were broken by snap/end shock
fractures. None are heat treated.

Figure 4.27. Bifaces and uniface from 41RK704. (a) Stage 1 biface; (b) Stage 2 biface; (c) miscellaneous uniface.

The single Stage 3 biface is a small proximal section, and the single Stage
4 biface is a proximal-medial fragment. Both are of gravel chert. Both exhibit snap/
end shock breaks from manufacture errors. Neither is heat treated.
Indeterminate biface fragments consist of one medial section, one distal
section, and one undetermined piece. One is of silicified wood, and two are of cherts
from unknown sources. The distal fragment has a perverse fracture, and the medial
fragment has a snap/end shock fracture. Failure cause for the third could not be
determined. None are heat treated.
uniface
The single uniface consists of a tabular piece of silicified wood with poor
fracture properties. One convex end has been roughly percussion chipped (Figure
4.27c). The edge angle is about 58 degrees. No use wear can be identified. This
specimen resembles artifacts that have been referred to as Harvey or Mineola bifaces.
Ground Stone Tools
There are 15 ground stone artifacts: 3 pitted stones, 3 hammerstones, 7 axe
fragments, 1 grooved stone, and 1 indeterminate fragment. Also included under this
heading are 2 manuports.
The three pitted stones are of hematite, ferruginous sandstone/hematite,
and tan sandstone (Figure 4.28a–b). The hematite specimen may be a recycled
fragment of some other type of polished and smoothed artifact. One surface has
a broad shallow depression, but much of the exterior surface has exfoliated due
to weathering. The ferruginous sandstone artifact is a tabular fragment with a
battered and pitted surface depression on one face and an abraded flat surface with

pitting and scratches from use as an anvil or slab on the opposing face. This artifact
functioned both as a pitted stone and an anvil or working surface. One end also
appears lightly battered from use. The final pitted stone is a tan sandstone cobble
that has a shallow pitted depression on one face. The opposing face is convex and is
abraded and smooth, perhaps from use as a grinding stone or hand mano. All edges
and ridges are battered from use.

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
The three hammerstones are of gravel quartzite, hematite, and silicified
wood. The quartzite specimen is a small cobble with a stream-battered exterior.
There are three facets of battering wear on the edges of this artifact. The hematite
hammerstone is a well-polished cobble with battering along part of the edge. The
exterior polished surface has begun to exfoliate, and the outer layer is fragile. The
final specimen is a massive, dense, stream-worn cobble of silicified wood consisting
mostly of replacement quartz. Edges and projections are lightly battered.
No substantially complete grooved hematite axes were recovered, but seven
polished hematite fragments appear to be pieces of axes. Four fragments are portions
of the poll area, one is a mid-section piece, one is an angular fragment, and one is
a bit fragment. Most exhibit polished and smoothed flake scar ridges and polished
or ground surfaces. All represent portions of completed implements.
A subangular weathered piece of coarse-grained ferruginous sandstone has
a remnant of a groove on one face (Figure 4.28c). This specimen exhibits no other
modification.
The final ground stone is a small, subangular, tabular fragment of ferruginous
sandstone. One surface has a small area of abrasion and smoothing. Function is
unknown, but it may be a small portion of an anvil or grinding slab.
Two quartzite pebbles are considered to be manuports, since they were
probably procured from some local gravel source and carried to the site. There is
no observable wear on either specimen. They may have been gathered as part of
raw material procurement events. Although their functions are not known, similar
materials were used as polishing stones for ceramic vessel manufacture. They could
also have been collected for use as small pebble hammerstones.
Ceramic Vessel Sherds
A total of 15 ceramic vessel sherds (123.6 g) were recovered, 2 of which
(1.8 g) are too small for analysis. The analyzed sherds range in size from 2.0 to
6.5 cm and consist of 10 body sherds, 2 rims, and 1 base. The rim and body sherds
are 5.65–9.84 mm thick (mean = 7.77 mm, standard deviation = 1.00), and the base
is 9.08 mm thick. Temper varies, with 5 having grog, 3 having grog and bone with
voids, 2 having bone and voids, 1 with grog and bone, 1 with bone, and 1 having only
voids. Exterior and interior surfaces are mainly smoothed, although 1 body exterior
shows evidence of burnishing; 2 sherds have surfaces that are indeterminate due
to erosion. Exterior surface colors are mainly light brown, red, or gray, and cores
are black or gray.
All sherds but one are undecorated. The decorated sherd is a rim that has
a straight orientation with a tapered lip. It has incised notching on the lip (Figure
4.29a). The sherd also has a drill hole 1 cm below the lip. The second rim has a
slightly inverted orientation with a tapered lip (Figure 4.29b). Both rims, although
too small for vessel diameter measurements, are suggestive of bowl vessel forms. The
single base is suggestive of a rounded form. None of these sherds can be associated
with a ceramic type. However, they all appear to be Caddo wares.

Faunal Remains
Three faunal bone specimens were collected. One is an unburned, unidentified,
small mammal bone fragment from Level 1 of Test Unit 4. This specimen is likely
modern. The other two are from Feature 1 (Level 12 of Test Unit 4 and Level 11
of Test Unit 5). Both are small burned fragments of unidentified mammal bones.
Carbonized Botanical Remains
A total of 75.88 g of charred botanical remains were recovered. Six samples
were submitted for identification prior to radiocarbon dating (see Appendix B). Three
samples were from Levels 5–7 of Test Unit 2. The other three were from Feature 1,
Levels 10 and 11 of Test Unit 5. Five of the six samples were identified as hickory
nutshell (Carya sp.). The sixth sample was identified as oak wood (Quercus sp.) and
was not submitted for dating.
Radiocarbon Dates
Five radiocarbon dates were obtained on carbonized nutshell samples (Table
4.14; see Appendix C). Three are from Feature 1 (Levels 10–11 of Test Unit 5), and
two are from Levels 6 and 7 in Test Unit 2. Both dates from Test Unit 2 indicate
occupations during the middle part of the Woodland period; for the date with two
ranges, the later range has a higher probability than the earlier one (0.75 vs. 0.25)
based on the CALIB radiocarbon calibration program (Rev7.1.0; Stuiver et al. 2015).
Hence, the Test Unit 2 dates overlap mostly in the mid a.d. 300s to early 400s. Two
of the dates from Feature 1 (a.d. 885–1015 and 1035–1215) indicate use during the
Early Caddo period. The third has two intervals in the late part of the Woodland

period (a.d. 715–745 and 765–890), with the later one having a much higher
probability than the earlier one (0.88 vs. 0.11) based on the CALIB radiocarbon
calibration program (Rev7.1.0; Stuiver et al. 2015).

Summary and Conclusions
Site 41RK704 occupies a small terrace rise on the floodplain of Cherokee
Bayou. Three trenches and six test units were used to investigate this 550-m2 area.
The excavations yielded a small collection of 15 prehistoric ceramic sherds and a
large collection of 1,173 lithic artifacts. The ceramic artifact density (2.3/m2) is very
low, and the lithic density (193.8/m2) is by far the highest among the tested sites.
One part of the site contains sediments that have been organically enriched,
presumably through Native American occupation, but not to the degree that a midden
formed. The excavations identified a single possible cultural feature in this area,
starting at 50–60 cm below the surface and extending to 120 cm; it may be a large
shallow pit, or it may simply reflect noncultural variation in the vertical extent of
the organically enriched sediments. The absence of other features likely relates to
the presence of thick homogeneous alluvial sands where matrix-supported features
such as postholes and pits have a low likelihood of survival and recognition, given the
nature of the sediments and the degree of bioturbation. All of the test units reached
130 cm without encountering pre-Holocene deposits. Artifacts were found throughout
this full thickness but were most frequent at 10–120 cm; there are no indications
in their vertical distributions that they could be segregated into components. Lithic
artifacts are most frequent at 90–110 cm but occur in moderately high densities as
shallow as 10 cm and as deep as 120 cm; ceramic sherds occur at 10–110 cm, with
93 percent at 30–110 cm.
Five radiocarbon dates were obtained, three from the possible pit feature and
two from nonfeature contexts. Two indicate occupation during the middle part of the
Woodland period, probably between the mid a.d. 300s and early 400s. One indicates
occupation in the late part of the Woodland period, probably between a.d. 765 and
890. And two dates indicate use during the Early Caddo period, between a.d. 885
and 1215. The ceramic assemblage is too small and nondistinctive to convey much
information about chronology, but it is more consistent with Caddo wares than

103

104

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
Woodland ceramics, and the absence of brushed sherds suggests they go with an
Early Caddo occupation. The one Catahoula (from 100–110 cm) and four Steiner
(from 20–30, 50–60, 90–100, and 110–120 cm) arrow points likely relate to use during
the Early Caddo period, and the five Friley arrow points (from 0–10, 30–40, 60–70,
and 110–120 cm) could be either Early Caddo or late Woodland. The two Cuney
arrow points (from 10–20 and 60–70 cm) may be associated with the Early Caddo
component, but this type is not common in this area and not very useful for dating.
The seven Gary dart points (from 30–70 and 80–90 cm) and single Edgewood and
Kent points (both from 90–100 cm) could easily relate to use during the Woodland
period, although they also could indicate earlier occupation in the Late Archaic
period as well.
Site 41RK704 appears to be a multicomponent site occupied during the
middle and late parts of the Woodland period and the Early Caddo period, at a
minimum. The primary Woodland component represents repeated, relatively
intensive use, perhaps as some sort of special-purpose campsite, and the Early
Caddo component probably represents use as a procurement or processing location
or short-term campsite by people who lived at the Hudnall-Pirtle site. The paucity of
preserved cultural features and inability to segregate the artifacts into components
means that this site has a low capacity to contribute important information about
these kinds of occupations. The artifacts, botanical remains, and dates generated by
this project are instructive about the age and likely function of the site, but without
a preserved feature assemblage the site cannot provide any information about site
spatial organization. With this limitation, 41RK704 is considered ineligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
site 41RK729
Setting
Site 41RK729 is on a broad area of elevated level ground surround­ed by
floodplain and wetland at the mouth of a stream channel as it enters the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain (Figure 4.30). The elevated landform, at an elevation of 245–250 ft
and less than 1 m higher than the adjacent floodplain, may be a low Pleistocene or
Holocene terrace. To the southwest is an inundated swampy area corresponding to
the stream mouth beyond the south valley wall. Vegetation consists of hardwoods,
some loblolly pines, and palmettos. There are no notable high-water marks on the
trees on the landform, and thus it may not be regularly in­undated. Disturbances
include erosion, animal burrowing, tree throws, and an all-terrain-vehicle track
along the east side of the site. The site also has been selectively thinned of timber
in the past.
Previous Investigations
Site 41RK729 was recorded in 2012 during survey of the Rusk Permit’s
Area W (Dockall et al. 2014). Twenty-one shovel tests were excavated across the
landform, only 4 of which yielded a total of five artifacts. The assemblage consists
of two complete flakes, one bipolar flake, one dart point or biface fragment, and one

Site 41RK729 was recommended for testing due to its potential to yield useful
information about Native American use of the floodplain and, potentially, Caddo
settlement systems relating to the Early Caddo ceremonial center at the HudnallPirtle site to the northeast.

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
Work Accomplished
Test excavations involved manual excavation of 1x1-m test units and
mechanical excavation by backhoe. Test units were placed at 20-m intervals across
most of the site, except the northwestern edge, which was inundated at the time of
this investigation. Trenches were positioned as permitted by the vegetation. Fourteen
test units and 6 backhoe trenches were excavated. Trenches varied from 6 to 10 m
in length, with an average of 8.2 m, and were 0.6–1.0 m deep. Trench excavations
totaled 49 m2. The 14 test units ranged from 0.8 to 1.0 m in depth, with an average
of 0.95 m; 13.15 m3 of sediment were removed and screened.
Site Sediments
Soils are mapped as frequently flood­ed Laneville loam but more closely
resemble Iulus fine sandy loam, which is a very deep, moderately well-drained,
moderately permeable soil formed in recent alluvium (Griffith 2000:48; Soil Survey
Staff, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service
2004b). A typical soil profile observed in the test excavations consists of 15–30 cm
of dark yellowish brown to brown fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand overlying
70 cm or more of mottled fine sandy loam. Mottles vary from light brownish gray to
light yellowish brown iron redox depletions to yellowish red redox concentrations.
Iron-manganese concretions are common in the lower levels. The test units and
trenches hit the water table or very wet soils between 55 and 110 cm below surface
and did not reach clayey subsoil representing a Bt horizon. Many roots and common
krotovina are present in the upper 30 cm. The sediments exposed in the excavations
appear to represent Pleistocene or Holocene alluvium based on their position on
the landscape, but no depositional structures indicative of intact stratigraphy were
observed, presumably because of thorough bioturbation.
Site Extent and Depth
Artifacts were found in 13 of the 14 test units, confirming that the site
extends across almost all of the area tested (Table 4.15). No artifacts were found
during backhoe trenching. Artifact densities are highest in Test Units 9, 10, and 13
on the south edge of the site, with densities ranging from 14 to 16 artifacts per m2
compared with an average of only 2.5/m2 in the remaining 11 units. The density for
the site as a whole in only 5.2/m2. Artifacts were recovered from 0 to 100 cm below
surface but are most common at 20–80 cm.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were identified in any of the test units or trenches.
Materials Recovered
The artifacts recovered from 41RK729 consist of 2 cores, 65 pieces of
unmodified debitage, 4 chipped stone tools, and 2 ceramic sherds; also recovered
were 2 faunal bone fragments. Appendix A contains metric data for the lithic tools.

Cores and Debitage
The cores consist of a small (32.9 mm) bipolar specimen and a small
(32.9 mm) tested pebble. Both are of locally available gravel chert.
The small debitage sample predominantly represents local gravel chert,
gravel quartzite, and silicified wood (n = 48; 74 percent). Twelve flakes (18 percent)
are of unknown-origin chert or quartzite, and 5 flakes (8 percent) are of nonlocal
Edwards chert or gray chert. Of interest is the absence of hematite and ferruginous
sandstone debitage, which corresponds to the absence of ground stone artifacts in
the assemblage. Table 4.16 showing the distribution of flake types by size grade
demonstrates a breakdown similar to the tested sites with larger assemblages. An
identical array of flake types is present. The small size of locally available stones
is a significant factor influencing the choice of flaking techniques, and late-stage
tool manufacture and tool maintenance are suggested by the array of flake types.
There are only 3 pieces of debitage with any dorsal cortex. Heat treatment was not
observed on any debitage.

Ceramics
Two ceramic vessel sherds (23.5 g) were recovered from Test Unit 10, Levels
5 and 6. The larger one appears to be a neck sherd, while the smaller one is a body
sherd. The overall sizes of these sherds are 2.5 and 5.0 cm, and they are 6.81 and
8.19 mm thick. Both are grog tempered and have smoothed exterior and interior
surfaces. The neck sherd has burned residue on its exterior surface, but otherwise
the exterior colors for both are light brown, and core colors are gray and black.
Neither sherd is decorated, and as such no association can be made to ceramic
type. However, the neck sherd is suggestive of a large everted-rimmed jar that is a
common Caddo ceramic vessel form.
Faunal Remains
Two faunal bone fragments were recovered from Test Unit 11. One, from
Level 1, is an unburned vertebra from a small mammal; it is likely modern. The
second specimen, from Level 7, is a small burned mammal bone fragment that could
not be further identified.

Radiocarbon Dates
No radiocarbon dates were obtained, since no charred botanical materials
were recovered.
Summary and Conclusions
Site 41RK729 occupies elevated ground on a low terrace on the floodplain
of Cherokee Bayou. Six trenches and 14 test units were used to investigate this
5,400-m2 area. The excavations yielded a small collection of 2 prehistoric ceramic
sherds and 71 lithic artifacts. The ceramic artifact density (0.1/m2) is extremely low,
and the lithic density (5.1/m2) is low as well.
The excavations identified no cultural features, probably because most of the
site contains thick homogeneous alluvial sands where matrix-supported features
such as postholes and pits have a low likelihood of survival and recognition, given
the nature of the sediments and the degree of bioturbation. All of the test units
reached 80–100 cm without encountering pre-Holocene deposits. Artifacts were
found at 0–100 cm, with most of the lithics (85 percent) at 20–80 cm and the sherds
at 40–60 cm. There are no indications in their vertical distributions that they could
be segregated into components.
No radiocarbon dates were obtained because no botanical materials
suitable for dating were found. The ceramics are too few and too nondistinctive to
be informative in terms of chronology, other than to indicate use during the Caddo
period after a.d. 900. The single Cuney arrow point (from 30–40 cm) is consistent
with this interpretation, but this type is not common in this area and thus is not
useful for more-specific dating. The single Gary dart point (from 30–40 cm) also could
be consistent with a Caddo period occupation, but it more often indicates Woodland
or Late Archaic occupation.
Site 41RK729 is hard to interpret because of the paucity of cultural materials.
It clearly has a Caddo component and was used in a limited, probably nonresidential,
way; otherwise little can be said about it. The absence of preserved cultural features
and datable materials and the inability to segregate the artifacts into components
(or to determine if more than one component is present) means that the site has a
low capacity to contribute important information. The artifacts generated by this
project are minimally instructive about the age and possible function of the site,
but without features the site cannot provide any information about site spatial
organization. With this limitation, 41RK729 is considered ineligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places.

CHAPTER 5: conclusions and national
register assessments

This chapter consists of two parts. The first discusses overall conclusions
relating to Native American use of the area, stemming from information gathered
during this project. The second assesses the seven sites in terms of their eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Native american use of the project area
The previous extensive surveys of the Rusk Permit project area (Dockall
et al. 2010, 2014) provided broad-brush interpretations concerning the prehistoric
occupation of this portion of the middle Sabine River drainage. First, the density of
prehistoric sites is not even across the area, with prehistoric sites most common in
Pleistocene terrace and valley wall settings in the eastern part (Area V) and on the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain in the western part (Area W). These settings provided
access to water resources such as Hendricks Lake, Black Slough, and Cherokee
Bayou. In addition, parts of these landforms provided arable farmland where Caddo
Indians could have grown crops.
Sites are much less common in upland areas back from the valley wall. One
reason for the low density of upland sites appears to be the scarcity of sufficient and
stable water sources. Although springs are present in upland settings, particularly
along the interface between the uplands and Pleistocene terrace segments, they
are mostly at runoff-fed drainages and lack continual flow. The few prehistoric sites
found along these small drainages are mostly small lithic scatters.
The site density for the almost 9,500 acres of surveyed land in the Rusk
Permit overall (i.e., Areas V and W combined) is much lower than that for the
surveyed parts of the Sabine Mine north of the river (Table 5.1). As noted by Dockall
et al. (2010:228; 2014:217), this probably relates at least partly to the fact that the
north side of the river is drained by a number of perennial south-flowing tributaries
that create a multitude of ideal settings for Native American occupation sites, while
the uplands south of the river are drained by intermittent streams. Hence, Native
American settlement strategies in this region, during some time periods anyway,
may have been tributary oriented rather than river oriented.
The site density data from Martin Lake Mine and Oak Hill Mine suggest that
something more may have been going on, though, with prehistoric sites being even
scarcer in both of these than in the Rusk Permit area (see Table 5.1). Although both
Martin Lake and Oak Hill consist of large expanses of uplands where sites should be

infrequent, both also contain perennial
tributary stream valleys where one
would expect high site densities. Indeed,

settled compared to the area north of
the river. For at least parts of the late
prehistoric Caddo period, this could
indicate that the area south of the river was a buffer zone between intensively used
parts of the Sabine valley to the north and the Neches valley to the south.

Table 5.1. Native American site densities in the Sabine
Mine’s Rusk Permit and other nearby project areas

The information from the seven sites tested during the project reported
here indicates that Native Americans used the Cherokee Bayou floodplain and
adjacent uplands at least as early as the Middle Archaic period (ca. 3500 b.c.)
and as late as the Late Caddo period (late a.d. 1400s). Site 41RK703 has the sole
Middle Archaic component, as indicated by three radiocarbon dates and a single
Wells point. Based on the dates, the presence of burned rock features, and the
high lithic artifact density, it is surmised that Native Americans used the elevated
floodplain landform as a campsite repeatedly and intensively during the Middle
Archaic, and the four Ellis and Trinity points, and maybe the two Gary points,
indicate that this use continued during the Late Archaic period. The only other
site with a good candidate for a Late Archaic component is 41RK704 nearby;
this component is suggested by two Edgewood and Kent points but is not dated
radiometrically. This component is hard to interpret because the predominant
Woodland component there overwhelms it.
Native Americans used the floodplain rise at 41RK704 intensively and
repeatedly during the middle and late parts of the Woodland period (probably mid
a.d. 300s–early 400s and ca. a.d. 765–890), judging from the radiocarbon dates,
seven Gary points, five Friley points, very high lithic artifact densities, and presence
of organically enriched sediments. The absence of ceramics (the small assemblage
found appears to go with a later Early Caddo component) implies that the site was
used for a narrower range of activities than would be expected at a fully residential
campsite, given that typical Woodland ceramic assemblages have been found at other
sites nearby (such as 41HS231 and 41RK562), and thus 41RK704 is interpreted
as a special-purpose campsite. This is consistent with its floodplain setting, which
probably would have made it unsuitable for year-round occupation. But its high
artifact density indicates that, when it was occupied, it was used intensively, and
the abundance of macrobotanical remains, most of which are hardwood nutshells,
indicates that some of the resources processed there were carried in from elsewhere,
i.e., the adjoining uplands. Based on this evidence, 41RK704 cannot be interpreted
as a campsite used strictly for procurement or processing of resources from its
immediate floodplain environs.

Chapter 5: Conclusions and National Register Assessments
Five other sites may have seen less intensive occupations during the
Woodland period. This is evidenced by the two radiocarbon dates from 41RK680,
and it is suggested by the four Friley points from 41RK674 and 41RK703 and
perhaps the two Gary points from 41RK695 and 41RK729. These minor (and in
most cases conjectural) Woodland components are hard to interpret functionally, but
the sparseness of artifacts and absence of ceramics (those at 41RK674, 41RK695,
41RK703, and 41RK729 go with later Caddo components) suggest nonresidential
use for limited ranges of activities.
Caddo components are most conspicuous, both in sizeable ceramic assemblages
and a total of 10 radiocarbon dates, at 41RK674 and 41RK693. The former dates
to the Late Caddo period (mid to late a.d. 1400s), and the latter is probably Middle
Caddo (a.d. 1300s). Neither site contains preserved feature assemblages indicating
the nature of the occupations, but the abundance of ceramics and the recovery of
corn from 41RK693 indicate they probably were farmsteads. Both are in upland
settings atop the valley wall, on landforms well removed from the threat of flooding
by Cherokee Bayou and with easily tilled soils suited for growing crops. Site 41RK674
probably was associated with the Pine Tree Mound community centered on Potters
Creek north of the Sabine River. Site 41RK693 was contemporaneous with the
early part of that same community and could have been associated with it as well,
or it may have been more connected to the contemporaneous community that was
anchored by the Oak Hill Village site farther away to the southwest. Based on the
survey evidence, there are no other sites like these in the 6-km-long stretch of valley
wall within Area W, and thus use of this area for outlying farmsteads during the
Middle and Late Caddo periods was not common.
Four other sites have minor Caddo components. Site 41RK695 yielded a
small ceramic assemblage, at least some of which probably dates to the Late Caddo
period. Its location along a small tributary well back from the valley wall and its low
artifact density suggest nonintensive use, perhaps for procurement or processing
of upland resources. Site 41RK703 yielded a handful of sherds that could be Early
Caddo (at least, it is not certain that they are Late Caddo), and they suggest some
very ephemeral use of that floodplain rise during that period. Site 41RK704 also
yielded a small, possibly Early Caddo ceramic assemblage, and two radiocarbon dates
and five Catahoula and Steiner arrow points, and perhaps the two Cuney points,
provide support for an Early Caddo component on this floodplain rise as well. This
occupation may have been more intensive than that at 41RK703, but, like the earlier
Woodland component at 41RK704, it probably was not year-round and entailed a
limited range of activities. These sites are not far from the Hudnall-Pirtle site, and
it is likely that 41RK703 and 41RK704 were used as procurement or processing
locations or short-term campsites by people who lived at that ceremonial-civic center.
Finally, 41RK729 yielded just two sherds indicating limited use during some part
of the Caddo period, but the evidence is too sparse to say anything more than that.
Table 5.2 provides information for comparing these seven sites with selected
other investigated sites in the Rusk Permit south of the Sabine River and in the part
of the Sabine Mine north of the river. It includes data from 41RK557 and 41RK562
in Area V to the east; 41HS231 and 41HS588, which are immediately north of

113

114

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
the river on the east side of Hatley Creek; 41HS74 and 41HS463 on Hatley and
Hardin Creeks north of the river; and 41HS15 (Pine Tree Mound) and six nearby
sites—41HS16, 41HS573, 41HS843, 41HS844, 41HS846, and 41HS915—on Potters
and Starkey Creeks at the northeast edge of the study area (Figure 5.1).
Site 41RK557, tested in 2009–2010 (Dockall and Fields 2011), is one of five
sites with Caddo materials that cluster on the Pleistocene terrace where Trammel’s
Trace comes up out of the south side of the Sabine River bottoms (the other sites, all
largely or wholly untested, are 41RK77, 41RK558, 41RK560, and 41RK561). Based
on survey data, Dockall et al. (2010:229) suggested that these could represent a series
of small residential sites and short-term trailside campsites dating to various parts
of the Caddo period rather than a single large Caddo village. Testing at 41RK557
supported this conclusion for that site (Dockall and Fields 2011:35–59). It did not
have a well-preserved feature assemblage to help convey information about its
function, at least in part because it was in thick sands, but the lack of middens and
the moderate artifact densities argue against sustained, long-term occupation. Most
of the artifacts and radiocarbon dates appear to reflect use during the Middle and
Late Caddo periods, connecting it to the Pine Tree Mound community on Potters
Creek to the north, but some dates and artifacts indicate limited use during the
Archaic, Woodland, and Early Caddo periods as well.
Site 41RK562, also tested in 2009–2010 (Dockall and Fields 2011), is on the
toeslope of the Pleistocene terrace at the south edge of the Sabine River floodplain.
It has a Woodland component marked by Friley arrow points and ceramics that are
typed as, or are similar to, Coles Creek Incised, Marksville Incised, and Williams
Plain (Dockall and Fields 2011:67–79). The component remains undated and is hard
to interpret because no features were identified in the thick sands, but the overall
sparseness of materials suggests limited use, perhaps as a short-term campsite.
Site 41HS231, tested in 2006–2007 (Dockall et al. 2008), contains a prominent
Woodland component focused on the south part of the site on the bluff overlooking
the Sabine River floodplain, apparently representing repeated reoccupation of a
favored campsite by Native American groups. The southern site area also has a
strong Caddo component, perhaps dating mostly to the Middle Caddo period and into
the early part of the Late Caddo period, although there are hints of use during the
Early Caddo period as well, probably associated with the Hudnall-Pirtle site not far
away (Dockall et al. 2008:146). It appears the Caddo used this part of 41HS231 as
a campsite or procurement or processing area rather than for residential activities.
The north part of 41HS231 saw only limited use during the Caddo period.
Site 41HS588, just east of 41HS231 on the bluff above the Sabine River
floodplain, saw extensive test excavations in 2006–2007 (Dockall et al. 2008). It
has some earlier materials, but most of the archeological remains relate to use as a
Caddo farmstead, with the south part being the locus of residential activities and
the north part more likely used for outside activities (Dockall et al. 2008:146–147).
With a midden and numerous features, the south knoll supported at least one house
and probably more, along with multiple activity areas. The radiocarbon dates point
to occupation mostly between the a.d. 1300s and mid to late 1600s, i.e., the Middle

and Late Caddo periods. The kinds of pottery recovered are consistent with this, as
are most of the arrow points.
Site 41HS74, on Hatley Creek well north of the Sabine River valley wall,
saw extensive manual and machine excavations in 1986 (Heartfield, Price and
Greene, Inc. 1988). It contained a small Early–Middle Caddo cemetery and abundant

Chapter 5: Conclusions and National Register Assessments
associated occupation debris, as well as a prominent Late Archaic component and
a minor Late Caddo one. The materials representing the various occupations could
not be fully segregated from one another, however, and other than the burials and
a handful of artifact concentrations, features were not identified. Despite this
limitation, there is no doubt that 41HS74 represents a Caddo farmstead and that
it was used repeatedly, probably as a camp site, during the Archaic period.
Site 41HS463 (Purple Duck Overlook), on Hardin Creek in the uplands
north of the Sabine River floodplain, saw moderately extensive manual excavations
in 1993–1994 (Keller 1996b). Probably because of the thick bioturbated sands and
lack of any machine excavations, no features were identified, limiting the site’s
interpretability. Nonetheless, the artifacts recovered indicate that it was occupied
during the Late Archaic period, probably as a camp site. Unlike 41HS74 and many
other sites in the Area With Archaic components, there is no indication that 41HS463
was used after the Archaic period.
The Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15) on Potters Creek north of the Sabine
River is the most extensively excavated site at the Sabine Mine. Work there in 2004
and 2006–2007 revealed that it consists of a ceremonial core Area With earthen
mounds, off-mound structures, and a cemetery situated around a plaza, with
perhaps 15 residential areas surrounding the core area (Fields and Gadus 2012).
It served as the heart of a Caddo community that was established in the a.d. 1300s
and survived till at least the mid 1600s, and perhaps through most of the 1700s.
Most of the excavations were done in areas surrounding the ceremonial core. Two
of these (Areas 2 and 8) were residential areas that contained at least 38 houses,
and a third (Area 3) apparently functioned as an outdoor activity area.
Sites 41HS573, 41HS843, 41HS844, and 41HS846, all of which were tested in
2005 (Gadus et al. 2006), contain artifacts of various ages, but all have components
dating to the Middle to Late Caddo period that are considered part of the Pine
Tree Mound community. At 41HS573, 41HS844, and 41HS846 (separated into the
east garden and Fyffe house rises where the Caddo component is most prominent,
and the rest of the site where Caddo materials are sparse), these components
are interpreted as representing farmsteads, with 41HS844 perhaps having been
occupied less intensively (not year round?) than the others. Site 41HS843 appears
to have functioned differently, for example, as a seasonally occupied field camp or
processing location.
The final two sites used in this comparative study are on Potters Creek
just south of Pine Tree Mound. The Resch site (41HS16) was excavated extensively
by avocational archeologists in the 1960s, and the Hawkwind site (41HS915) saw
a moderate amount of excavation in a 2009 in a project sponsored by the Texas
Department of Transportation (Ellis et al. 2013; Webb et al. 1969). Interpretation
is hampered by the lack of consistent screening at Resch, the fact that most of the
excavation at Hawkwind was done by machine using gross provenience units with
screening of only some of the removed sediments, and the presence of thick sands
with poor feature preservation at both sites, but both sites predominantly predate
the Caddo period and are most informative about Woodland period use of the area.

117

118

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
In particular, their sherd assemblages indicate that Woodland groups in this part
of the Sabine River valley had a ceramic technology that incorporated attributes of
traditions followed by groups in neighboring regions, “from the thick grog-tempered
Fourche Maline wares with their plain flat bases, to the nontempered sandy paste
Mossy Grove wares with their round bases, to the LMV (lower Mississippi valley)
wares with their podal supports (Ellis et al. 2013:141).” Both sites appear to have
been used repeatedly as short-term camp sites, with Archaic occupations preceding
the Woodland ones and minor later Caddo occupations at Resch.
Of all the sites listed in Table 5.2, only Pine Tree Mound and the south
knoll at 41HS588 have substantial inventories of features, reflecting their function
as residential (and in the case of the former, also a ceremonial) loci. The apparent
low feature density at most of the other sites, including most of those in Area W, is
at least partly a function of poorer feature preservation in thicker sands and less
excavation (particularly less area exposed mechanically). However, the absence of
middens in the Area W sites implies that they did not support the kind of intensive
occupations that the Pine Tree Mound site and 41HS588 did.
Sites 41RK674 and 41RK693 in Area W and six sites elsewhere (most parts
of 41HS15, 41HS74, 41HS588 south knoll, 41HS573, 41HS844, and 41HS846 east
garden and Fyffe house rises) have higher densities of ceramic sherds than the
other sites, indicating they were used longer or more often for residential purposes.
As noted, the feature evidence supports this conclusion for 41HS15 and 41HS588,
as does the presence of the cemetery at 41HS74. Two other sites, 41HS843 and
41RK557, have moderate sherd densities, suggesting they may be interpreted best
as field camps or processing locations, although parts of 41RK557 have densities
high enough to suggest some kind of residential use. The remaining sites and parts
of sites, with very low densities of sherds, mostly predate the Caddo period (e.g.,
41RK680, 41RK703, and 41RK704 in Area W and 41RK562, 41HS16, 41HS463, and
41HS915 elsewhere) or were used in a nonintensive way by Caddo villagers who
lived nearby (in some cases, both explanations apply).
The variability in the densities of chipped stone tools and debitage and
ground stones is hard to interpret, since they represent an amalgam of things left
not only by the Caddo but also by people who used these sites during the Woodland
and Archaic periods. This is evidenced by the ranges of arrow and dart point types
identified, some of which are diagnostic of the Paleoindian, Middle Archaic, Late
Archaic, Woodland, Early Caddo, and Late Caddo periods. There is some correlation
between total chipped stone densities and the number of arrow and dart point
categories in an assemblage, suggesting that pre-Caddo components contributed
substantially to the lithic assemblages in some sites. This could help explain the
moderate and high lithic densities at 41RK557, 41HS231, 41HS588, 41HS843,
and 41HS846 east garden and Fyffe house rises, and it certainly is a factor in
the comparatively high lithic densities at 41RK703 and 41RK704 in Area W and
41RK562, 41HS16, 41HS74, 41HS463, and 41HS915 elsewhere. Conversely, the
low densities at Caddo residential sites such as 41HS15, 41HS573, 41HS844,
41RK674, and 41RK693 may indicate relatively little contribution by pre-Caddo
components. Ultimately though, it is risky to take these kinds of interpretations

Chapter 5: Conclusions and National Register Assessments
very far, given the often complex histories of site use and the inability to isolate
temporally discrete assemblages.
The lithic assemblages reflect the use of mainly locally available stone
resources, with the debris of nonlocal resource types attributable to the maintenance
of finished tools. Perttula (1984) has emphasized the importance of local vs. nonlocal
raw materials in northeast Texas and suggested that temporal fluctuations in their
use may inform us about social, ceremonial, and economic networks between the
Caddo region and the greater lower Mississippi valley and southeastern United
States. Perttula (1984) documents decreased use of nonlocal resources through time
from the Paleoindian period to the Middle to Late Caddo periods and suggests that
this decrease could be associated with increased sedentism, decreased mobility, and
a shift in patterns of exchange. Most of the Sabine Mine data are consistent with
the pattern of limited use of nonlocal materials, perhaps because most assemblages
are dominated by materials from Caddo occupations. With just three exceptions,
all of the assemblages summarized in Table 5.2 (minus the four where such data
are missing) have less than 10 percent debitage of nonlocal materials (averaging
5 percent). Even those sites where Woodland components are prominent (41RK562,
41RK680, 41RK704, and 41HS231) have low values of 2–6 percent.
Two of the Area W sites have unusually large amounts of nonlocal materials,
though, and these require some explanation. The high value for 41RK674 (32 percent)
may well be due to the small sample size (although this is not the case for two
other comparably small assemblages). Sample size does not explain the high value
(28 percent) for 41RK703, since it yielded the second-largest debitage collection. As
this is the only site where Archaic components predominate, it is tempting to view
its high value as conforming to the pattern that Perttula (1984) noted for northeast
Texas in general. Until more early sites in this part of the Sabine River valley
are excavated, though, it is impossible to determine if it is part of a pattern or an
anomaly. The third context with a relatively high percentage of nonlocal materials
(13 percent) is the core ceremonial area at Pine Tree Mound. This could reflect
more-frequent use of items made of exotic materials by high-status individuals
who lived there or in connection with rituals performed there, but caution argues
against overinterpretation of the data, since limited work has been done in that
part of the site compared to its size and complexity.
The ceramics from most of the sites are broadly similar. Brushed pottery is
common in the contexts with Caddo components, with examples of Pease BrushedIncised distinguishable in most of the larger collections. Ripley Engraved and
Maydelle Incised are the other ubiquitous, or nearly so, identifiable decorated types.
All of these types are typical for the Middle to Late Caddo period in this part of the
Sabine basin and the Cypress Creek basin to the north and northwest, i.e., the Titus
phase. Sherds typed as, or similar to, Harleton Appliqué, Killough Pinched, Taylor
Engraved, and maybe Simms Engraved from several sites probably also are part
of the local Middle–Late Caddo ceramic assemblage. The other identified pottery
relates to occupations predating the Middle to Late Caddo settlement of this area:
Kiam Incised, Davis Incised, Dunkin Incised, and Pennington Punctated-Incised
sherds indicate limited Early Caddo use of 41HS15, 41HS16, and 41HS846; sherds

119

120

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
identified to types including Hickory Fine Engraved, Crockett Curvilinear Incised,
Pennington Punctated-Incised, Holly Fine Engraved, Wilkinson Punctated, and
Carmel Engraved indicate more-substantial Early Caddo occupation at 41HS74; and
types such as Williams Plain, Marksville Incised, Coles Creek Incised, Tchefuncte
Plain, Tchefuncte Stamped, and Churupa Punctated indicate Woodland use of
41RK562, 41HS16, 41HS231, and 41HS915.
Another way of comparing the ceramics is with the simple, nontypological
measures of the percentage of brushing among the decorated sherds and the ratio of
plain to decorated sherds. Perttula (2002) has shown that both can provide temporal
information, since the frequency of decoration, particularly brushing, increased
over time in parts of the Caddo area. For example, Perttula (2002:78) concludes
that ceramic assemblages predating a.d. 1200 in this region have ratios of plain to
decorated sherds that are 2.97 to 1 or higher, while ratios for assemblages postdating
a.d. 1400 are 1.30 to 1 or lower. South of the Sabine River in Nacogdoches and Rusk
Counties, brushing occurs on over 50 percent of the decorated pottery in Late Caddo
sites (Perttula 2002:76). Information from the two best-dated sites near the Rusk
Permit support these patterns in a general fashion: the mostly Late Caddo Pine Tree
Mound site has a plain to decorated ratio of 0.49 to 1, with 76 percent of the decorated
sherds being brushed (Fields and Gadus 2012:470); and the mostly Middle Caddo
Oak Hill Village site has a plain to decorated ratio of 1.22 to 1, with 20 percent of
the decorated sherds being brushed (Rogers and Perttula 2004:210, 283).
Among the investigated Sabine Mine sites, 41RK674 in Area W, 41HS588,
41HS573, and all parts of 41HS15 have the highest percentages of brushing
(66–83 percent) and low ratios of plain to decorated sherds (0.48–0.99), indicating
that the ceramic assemblages are mostly Late Caddo. Sites 41RK557 and 41HS843
also have low plain to decorated ratios (0.87 and 1.00) but lower percentages of
brushing (52 and 47 percent); this could reflect relatively large contributions to the
ceramic assemblages by Middle Caddo occupations. Sites 41RK703, 41RK704, and
41RK729 in Area W and five sites elsewhere (41RK562, 41HS16, 41HS231 south half,
41HS846 other, and 41HS915) are at the other end of the scale, with high plain to
decorated ratios (5.20–12.00) and very low percentages of brushing (0–15 percent).
These numbers suggest that much of the ceramic assemblages from these contexts
predate the middle part of the Caddo period (i.e., are Woodland or Early Caddo); the
samples from 41RK703, 41RK704, 41RK729, and 41HS846 other are too small to be
interpreted very meaningfully, though. This probably also is the case for 41RK695
and the north part of 41HS231. The values for three other sites (41HS74, 41HS844,
and 41HS846) are intermediate, with comparatively low percentages of brushing
(25–38 percent) and moderate to moderately high plain to decorated ratios (1.27–
3.65). This suggests that these assemblages contain appreciable numbers of sherds
from occupations predating the Late Caddo period. At 41HS74 and 41HS846, this
is born out by the presence of sherds assignable to Early Caddo types. Finally, the
very low percentage of brushing (2 percent) and moderately high plain to decorated
ratio (2.28) at 41RK693 in Area W suggests that most of the assemblage predates
the Middle Caddo period; this is not borne out by the radiocarbon dates, though,
which indicates the site is Middle Caddo.

Chapter 5: Conclusions and National Register Assessments
national register assessments
At the beginning of this project, 41RK674, 41RK693, and 41RK695 were
considered to warrant test excavations in part because of their possible association
with three nearby Caddo mound centers: the Hudnall-Pirtle, Lane Mitchell, and
Pine Tree Mound sites (4, 9, and 19 km to the northeast). Sites such as these would
have functioned within settlement systems consisting of a number of site types,
including multifamily villages, smaller residential hamlets, campsites, and resource
procurement and processing areas. If interpretable components could be isolated,
these sites would contribute to a better understanding of those settlement systems.
The other four sites—41RK680, 41RK703, 41RK704, and 41RK729—also
were judged to have the potential to contain important information relevant to
the topic of Caddo settlement systems, and in particular how use of the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain fit into those systems. In addition, because they are on floodplain
rises that probably represent remnants of low alluvial terraces, it was considered
possible that the archeological remains could be encased in stratified Holocene
alluvium where isolating components would be comparatively easy.
The data presented in Chapter 4 for some of these sites, especially 41RK674,
41RK693, 41RK703, and 41RK704, are useful for gaining a better understanding of
how Native Americans used this part of the Cherokee Bayou valley in the Archaic,
Woodland, and Caddo periods, but none of the seven sites offers to contribute
additional important information beyond that gained from testing. Hence, all seven
are judged ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Two primary factors limit the importance of these sites. First, none contain
preserved feature assemblages to help interpret them functionally. Only five features
were identified in testing: a pit at 41RK693, three burned rock concentrations at
41RK703, and a possible pit at 41RK704. However, all but 41RK695 are in contexts
(i.e., thick unstratified sands) that are not conducive to the preservation of matrixsupported features such as postholes and pits, and thus there is no way of knowing
if the scarcity of features is real. At 41RK695, the surface sands are thin enough
that features should have been found, if substantial numbers are present. The fact
that none were found does shed some light on the apparently ephemeral nature of
the occupation, but otherwise that negative evidence is not informative. This chapter
does offer interpretations for the sites based on their artifact assemblages, artifact
densities, settings, and lack of middens; in the absence of features, though, these
interpretations remain speculative.
The second main limiting factor is that there is nothing in the vertical
distributions of the cultural materials to indicate that discrete components could
be isolated. None of the four floodplain sites have preserved alluvial stratigraphy,
presumably because of extensive bioturbation. Based on the radiocarbon dates
from 41RK703, it appears these terrace landforms are quite old, i.e., at least 5,000
years, giving ample time for bioturbation to essentially homogenize the deposits.
At all six sites with thick sands, artifacts are widely distributed vertically, and
there are no distinctive patterns of density peaks and valleys to serve as a basis
for determining what goes with what. At least 41RK703 and 41RK704 clearly have

121

122

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
multiple components, and it is possible that some or all of the other five sites do as
well, just less visibly so. Complicating the matter is the lack of features, which, if
present in sufficient numbers, might be useful for correlating occupation zones (and
perhaps components) between test units.
Since 41RK674, 41RK680 (south half), 41RK693, 41RK695, 41RK703,
41RK704, and 41RK729 lack the capacity to contribute important information and
hence are ineligible for listing in the National Register under Criterion D, no further
archeological work is warranted.

Remains

Appendix B: Macrobotanical Remains
Introduction
Nineteen samples of carbonized plant remains selected for possible radiocarbon dating
and 2 flotation samples from five sites in Rusk County, Texas, were submitted for identification
and analysis. The possible dating samples are from 16 proveniences at 41RK674, 41RK680,
41RK693, 41RK703, and 41RK704. The flotation samples represent seven cubic decimeters
from Feature 1 at 41RK693.
Ecological background
The five sites are on the floodplain or valley wall overlooking Cherokee Bayou in
northeastern Rusk County. The major drainage is the Sabine River. Rusk County lies squarely in
the Pineywoods ecological zone, the westernmost extension of the great Southeastern Evergreen
Forest that reaches across the southeastern United States to the Atlantic coast (Braun 1950).
Upland forests in this part of the Texas Pineywoods in presettlement times typically would
have been shortleaf communities, where shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) shared dominance
with oaks (especially southern red oak [Quercus falcata], post oak [Q. stellata], and blackjack
oak [Q. marilandica]) and hickories (several species, but frequently Carya texana) (Diggs et al.
2006:88–89).
The Cherokee Bayou floodplain would have offered a slightly different ecosystem, as
would the slopes and ravines near the sites. Rivers in East Texas are meandering and flow
slowly. Because of the abundant rainfall, they tend to overflow their banks, producing broad
floodplains with alluvial sand, silt, and clay deposits (Diggs et al. 2006:78). Floodplain forests
in the Pineywoods are places where fire-sensitive species can survive; the conditions also
necessitate flood-tolerant species. On smaller tributaries that flood for only short periods, the
forest is much like that in the mixed deciduous-loblolly forests that occur on slopes and in ravines.
These communities typically support many tree and shrub species, including loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), several kinds of oaks (Quercus spp.), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum
(Nyssa sylvatica), black cherry (Prunus serotina), beech (Fagus grandifolia), red maple (Acer
rubrum), magnolia (Magnolia spp.), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), holly (Ilex spp.), beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana), farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus
quinquefolia), and grape (Vitis spp.) (Bezanson 2000:27; Diggs et al. 2006:89). On larger, wetter
floodplains, dominant trees are mostly oaks, including willow oak (Quercus phellos), laurel oak
(Q. laurifolia), and overcup oak (Q. lyrata). In swamps and backwaters, baldcypress (Taxodium
distichum), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), and water elm (Planera aquatica) are important
(Diggs et al. 2006:90).
Commercial harvesting has resulted in significant changes in Pineywoods vegetation
since the mid-nineteenth century, with plantations of loblolly pine replacing shortleaf and longleaf
stands. Nonetheless, modern equivalents exist for most prehistoric plant communities in East
Texas (Diggs et al. 2006:87). Pollen studies indicate that use of the modern vegetation zones
described above is appropriate for understanding the plants and attendant animal resources
available to people during the first and second millennia. Weakly Bog, situated in the Post
Oak Savannah vegetation region southwest of Rusk County, provides some of the best data for
vegetation reconstruction in the eastern half of Texas during the last 3,000 years (Bousman
1998). Pollen profiles from this bog indicate oak and later oak-hickory woodlands, suggesting
that modern plant communities generally provide good analogs for Texas plant communities in

147

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
that period. A recent study by Bruce Albert in southwest Upshur County provides supporting
data (Albert 2007). Some fluctuations in rainfall and temperature have taken place, however
(Bousman 1998:204). Spikes in grass pollen at approximately 500 and 1500 b.p. suggest drier
conditions during those times (Bousman 1998).
Laboratory Methods
Flotation samples from 41RK693 were processed at Prewitt and Associates’ Austin offices
in a Flote-Tech flotation system. Light fractions were caught using a 0.212-mm mesh, and heavy
fractions were retained by 1.0-mm square mesh. Carbonized botanical material that remained
in the heavy fractions (mostly hickory nutshell) was removed and added to light fractions before
transfer to the botanical analyst.
In the laboratory, lots of carbonized plant remains were sorted and identified on freshly
washed glassware and handled only with latex gloves or metal forceps; contact with paper was
avoided. Writing instruments used in data entry were plastic mechanical pencils.
Flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures (Pearsall 2000). Each
light fraction was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200x0.01-g electronic balance before being
size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Materials that did not pass through
the No. 10 mesh (2 mm square openings) were completely sorted, and all carbonized botanical
remains were counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized botanical material larger
than 2 mm (usually rootlets) was weighed, recorded, and labeled as “contamination.” Materials
that fell through the 2-mm mesh (“residue”) were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at
7–45x magnification for carbonized botanical remains. Identifiable material other than wood,
nutshell, and fragmentary corn cupules was removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded,
and labeled. Uncarbonized macrobotanical remains were recorded on a presence/absence basis
on laboratory forms.
A sample of 20 wood charcoal fragments was selected at random from each flotation
sample for identification. Wood charcoal fragments were snapped to reveal a clean transverse
section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 28–180x magnification. When necessary,
tangential or radial sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings,
types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other minute characteristics that can only be seen at
the higher magnifications of this range. Wood charcoal fragments in the carbon samples were
identified according to the same procedure.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison
to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of
standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley
1961; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). Plant nomenclature follows that of the PLANTS
Database (USDA, NCRS 2014), except in cases where common names differ greatly from local
or archeological use.
Results
Identifications of carbon samples are listed in Table B.1. Dimensions of the corn cob
fragment and conjoined cupules recovered from 41RK693 are given in Table B.2. Flotationrecovered plant remains are shown in Table B.3.

Carbon Samples
The carbon samples consist of oak, hickory, and pine wood charcoal; thick hickory
nutshells; and corn cob/cupule fragments. The plant materials are typical of Middle to Late
Caddo sites in East Texas, and all are suitable for dating.
Flotation Samples
Modern Plants
Uncarbonized plant remains appear in the
flotation samples in the form of rootlets (included
under “Contamination” in Table B.3) and uncarbonized
seeds (shown on a presence/absence basis in Table
B.3). The seed taxa are weedy annuals likely to be
present at disturbed sites undergoing archeological
investigations. Uncarbonized seeds are a common
occurrence at most archaeological sites, but they
usually represent seeds of modern plants that have
made their way into the soil either through their
own dispersal mechanisms or by faunalturbation,
floralturbation, or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51–
52; Keepax 1977; Miksicek 1987:231–232). In all except
the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant
material at open-air sites can be assumed to be of
modern origin unless compelling evidence suggests
otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek

Testing in the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit, Area W
1987:231). Site 41RK693 has offered no such evidence, and only carbonized plant remains are
believed to be ancient.
Ancient Plant Remains
Corn is the only crop plant represented in the samples, and nearly all of the material
recovered consists of cob parts (n = 463, 1.35 g). A single kernel fragment weighing 0.01 g was
also recovered. Two seeds, a purslane seed and a cherry pit, indicate the exploitation of those wild
plants for food. Nutshells (1.21 g) consist of thick-shelled hickory (n = 45) and black walnut (n
= 3) plus six fragments that could only be assigned to the hickory/walnut family. A total of 1.56
g of wood charcoal was recovered in the flotation samples. Identified taxa consisted of hickory,
oak, pine, and a fragment of woody grape vine. Pine cone scales, probably associated with the
use of pine wood for fuel, were also recovered in both samples.

Dear Miss Fischbeck:
Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for 20 samples recently sent to us. The report sheet
contains the Conventional Radiocarbon Age (BP), the method used, material type, and applied
pretreatments, any sample specific comments and, where applicable, the two-sigma calendar calibration
range. The Conventional Radiocarbon ages have been corrected for total isotopic fractionation effects
(natural and laboratory induced).
All results (excluding some inappropriate material types) which fall within the range of available
calibration data are calibrated to calendar years (cal BC/AD) and calibrated radiocarbon years (cal BP).
Calibration was calculated using the one of the databases associated with the 2013 INTCAL program
(cited in the references on the bottom of the calibration graph page provided for each sample.) Multiple
probability ranges may appear in some cases, due to short-term variations in the atmospheric 14C contents
at certain time periods. Looking closely at the calibration graph provided and where the BP sigma limits
intercept the calibration curve will help you understand this phenomenon.
Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per the
conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce sigmas
lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result.
All work on these samples was performed in our laboratories in Miami under strict chain of
custody and quality control under ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 accreditation
protocols. Sample, modern and blanks were all analyzed in the same chemistry lines by qualified
professional technicians using identical reagents and counting parameters within our own particle
accelerators. A quality assurance report is posted to your directory for each result.
The cost of the analysis was charged to the American Express card provided. Thank you. As
always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
