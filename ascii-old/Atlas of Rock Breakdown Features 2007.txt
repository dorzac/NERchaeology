Chapter 1: Introduction
Bourke, M.C. and Viles, H.A.
A primary goal of geomorphological enquiry is to make genetic associations between
process and form. In rock breakdown studies, the links between process, inheritance and
lithology are not well constrained. In particular, there is a need to establish an
understanding of feature persistence. That is, to determine the extent to which in situ rock
breakdown (e.g., aeolian abrasion or salt weathering) masks signatures of earlier
geomorphic transport processes (e.g., fluvial transport or crater ejecta). Equally important
is the extent to which breakdown during geomorphic transport masks the imprint of past
weathering (Viles et al., 2005).
Sedimentary particles may retain their primary form to a substantial and recognizable
degree after more than one cycle of transport (Allen, 1985). This is due to the
predetermination of shape by factors such as the deposition of crystal boundaries (e.g.,
grains released from igneous and metamorphic rocks) and the attitude and spacing in the
rock of planar fractures including bedding, joints and cleavage. The exception to this is
where there has been breakage (Allen, 1985) as is found in fluvial, ejecta and talus
environments. Often this initial form is overprinted to some degree during transport (e.g.,
fluvial, glacial) and/or by subsequent alteration by erosion or weathering. These specific
geomorphic processes on Earth can be shown to produce a particular size and shape of
morphological response on rocks. For example, rocks subject to fluvial transport tend to
be well rounded (Howard, 1998), whilst those freshly collapsed from bedrock walls are
angular. However, the situation is complicated by lithology and some rocks respond more
rapidly and in different styles to breakdown processes. Over time, the inheritance of both
initial lithology and past processes may complicate the relationship between current
process and morphological response.
Similar landforms and features can result from quite different sets of processes and
histories (see discussion in Beven, 1996). Equifinality is of particular concern when
conducting geomorphological enquiry on other planetary bodies using only remotely
sensed data. By way of example, pits observed on the surface of clasts can be formed by
grinding, micro-impact, structural controls such as vesicles in basalt, or selective mineral
loss. In addition, flutes and grooves are known to form by both aeolian and fluvial
processes.
On Earth we generally have the ability to visit a field area and place a sample rock in its
geomorphic context by mapping the surrounding landforms and sediments. This is more
difficult on planets and moons such as Mars, Venus and Titan. Data from Landers and
Rovers return high resolution images that indicate a range of boulder morphologies and
surface features (Fig. I1) (see also Bridges et al., 1999; Greeley et al., 2004; Thomas et
al., 2005). Often the resolution is high enough to permit the observation and analysis of

Chapter 1: Introduction

individual facet-scale features, in addition to the traditional observations of clast
roundness and sphericity. These data are often used to interpret the transport and
environmental history of the rock. For example, studies of rock morphology, placement
and bedforms at the Mars Pathfinder landing site suggested that the sediments were the
typical deposits of catastrophic floods. However, definitive fluvial signatures were
difficult to identify on the rocks (e.g., Golombek et al., 1999). This is likely due to the
fact that they have been subject to sub-aerial erosion for more than two billion years.
The use of rock features in this way raises the important question: Can features on the
surface of a rock reliably indicate its geomorphic history? This has not been determined
for rock surfaces on Earth or other planets. A first step towards constraining the links
between process, inheritance, and morphology is to identify pristine features produced by
different process regimes. The purpose of this atlas is to provide a comprehensive image
collection of breakdown features commonly observed on boulders in different
geomorphic environments. The atlas is intended as a tool for planetary geoscientists and
their students to assist in identifying features found on rocks on planetary surfaces.
In compiling this atlas, we have attempted to include features that have formed ‘recently’
and where the potential for modification by another geomorphic process is low. However,
we acknowledge that this is, in fact, difficult to achieve when selecting rocks in their
natural environment. We group breakdown features according to their formative
environment and process (Fig.I2).
In selecting images for inclusion in the atlas we were mindful to cover a wide range of
climatic zones. For example, in the weathering chapter, clast features are shown from
locations such as the hyper-arid polar desert of Antarctica and the semi-arid canyons of
central Australia. This is important as some features (e.g., alveoli) occur across climate
regimes. We have drawn on the published geomorphological literature and our own field
experience. We use, where possible, images of extrusive igneous rocks as the data
returned from Mars, Venus and the Moon indicates that this is the predominant rock type.
One of the purposes of this atlas is to expand the range of surface features that are known
to indicate a particular geomorphic environment or process history. The surface features
on boulders in some environments such as aeolian and weathering are well understood. In
contrast, those in fluvial or ejecta environments are not. Therefore we have presented a
comprehensive assemblage of features that are likely to be produced in each of the
geomorphic environments. We hope that this atlas will trigger more research on
diagnostic features, particularly their morphometry and detailed morphology, their
persistence and rates of formation. In this first edition of the atlas we detail the features
found on clasts in three geomorphic environments: aeolian, fluvial and weathering.
Future editions of the atlas will include chapters on ejecta, micro-impacts, coastal,
colluvial, glacial and structural features.

Chapter 2: Aeolian Features

Introduction
Wind action causes the erosion of boulders through abrasion by entrained particulates.
Ever since the pioneering work of, amongst others, W. T. L. Travers in 1870 (as noted in
King, 1936) a whole suite of erosional features have been recorded and studied in areas
where wind and abrading agents are in ample supply. Much of the early research focused
on cataloguing sites in very different parts of the world where wind abrasion features
were found (e.g., Bosworth, 1910; King, 1936; Powers, 1936; Wentworth and Dickey,
1935) as well as understanding their formation (e.g., Kuenen, 1928). For
palaeoenvironmental research, such features have been used to confirm the past efficacy
of wind action, and also to infer dominant wind direction(s) at the time of feature
formation (Schlyter, 1995; Sharp, 1949).
Wind abrasion of boulders has been noted on several lithologies in a wide range of
environments including deserts, periglacial and coastal settings and has been reported on
Mars (see Bridges et al., 1999). There has been much debate over the types of
particulates which can cause such abrasion, with most scientists placing major emphasis
on sand, whilst some authors suggest that silt and snow can also be effective (Frich, 1988;
Schlyter, 1994). See Breed et al. (pg. 445-453, 1997) for discussion. In most cases, wind
abrasion by particulates has been observed to be concentrated on the upwind side of
boulders and outcrops, with the leeside commonly weathered and free from abrasion.
Recent estimates from boulders within a coastal structure in Oregon, USA indicate that
wind abrasion can proceed at rates of between 0.24 and 1.63 mm a-1 (Knight and
Burningham, 2003), although very different rates may be found in other localities.
Some previous authors have produced useful guides to the features produced by aeolian
action on rocks, including the classic review of Maxson (1940) and the more recent
compendium of Laity (1995). Both of these contain images which complement this atlas.

Ventifact
Scale: cm to m
Feature description:
Ventifacts may be simply defined as rocks shaped by aeolian abrasion (Cooke et al.,
1993). The term was introduced by Evans (1911) to describe wind-faceted stones, the
surfaces of which are flattened such that they intersect at sharp angles (Goudie, 2004b).
Such ventifacts have clear wind sculpted facets which themselves often have a whole
suite of smaller abrasion features developed on them. A common shape for small faceted
ventifacts is a streamlined, almond or brazil nut shape dominated by two or three surface
facets.

Chapter 2: Aeolian Features

Sharp facet edge (keel)
Scale: several mm to cm long (depending on size of facet), and < 1 mm wide
Feature description:
Facets are thought to be abraded at right angles to the formative wind where sand is the
dominant agent of abrasion. The edge between facets is often razor sharp, where each
facet is being actively abraded and/or where the rock is fine-grained. Facet edges are also
often called keels (e.g., Knight, 2005), and can be linear or serrated (Knight and
Burningham, 2001). The keel is usually aligned perpendicular to the prevailing wind
direction and thus can be used on fossil forms to infer palaeo-wind direction. However,
recently Knight (2005) drew attention to the need to take care with such inferences
because of the role, in some circumstances, of more localized controls on keel orientation
(such as boulder shape and local wind flow complexity).

Chapter 2: Aeolian Features

Straight facets
Scale: cm
Feature description:
Smaller facets carved into ventifacts by aeolian abrasion are generally straight in profile
(i.e. they have a flat face), although their shape can be affected by the pre-existing clast
form. Smaller rocks are also thought to produce simpler facets (i.e. planar and smooth
faces), than larger ones where pitting, fluting and other features are likely to develop
(Laity, 1994).

Chapter 2: Aeolian Features

Curvilinear facets
Scale: cm to m
Feature description:
Larger facets are usually abraded into slightly curved forms (Cooke et al., 1993). Indeed,
large ventifacts abraded by sand often have a highly convex windward facet with the top
part receding more rapidly than the lower section. Over time, long-term and intense
abrasion may eventually produce semi-planar surfaces (e.g., Laity, 1995, Fig.12).

Chapter 2: Aeolian Features

Flutes
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Flutes are near-linear depressions with U-shaped cross-sections, which are closed at the
upwind end. They are thought to form on low angled or horizontal surfaces, and they
have been observed to get shorter and deeper as the surface inclination increases.
Lancaster (1984) noted that, in the Namib Desert, there was some lithological control of
flute size – with coarse-grained rocks possessing larger and deeper flutes than finegrained rocks. According to Cooke et al. (1993) flutes and grooves are said to develop in
the early stages of ventifaction, usually originating from pits and becoming shallower
downwind. They are also said to be better developed on large rather than small rocks.
Breed et al. (1997) note the presence of y-shaped junctions in fields of flutes, where the
junctions close in the downwind direction. Flutes have been recorded having widths and
depths ranging from a few mm to several cm. Flute formation is still debated, but the
general consensus is that flutes are formed parallel to the wind on the windward side of
ventifacts as a result of abrasion by sand. Experimental studies by Whitney (1979)
suggested that fluting on leeward sides could be created by dust entrained in vortical flow
within winds. However the efficacy of dust as an abrading agent is the subject of debate
(see Breed et al., 1997). Flutes can also be formed by fluvial abrasion (see Figs. F24F26).

Grooves
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Grooves are similar features to flutes, and many workers group them together. However,
Laity (1994), amongst others, defines grooves as being longer than flutes and open at
both ends. They form on gently inclined surfaces, are often separated by sharp-crested,
sometimes sinuous ridges, and their scale varies from mm to cm. Laity (1995) measured
groove widths up to 7 cm in the Little Cowhole Mountains. Grooves can also be formed
by fluvial abrasion (Richardson and Carling, 2005).

Etching
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Lancaster (1984) describes how abrasion by dust (and sand) can produce etching,
whereby lithological and mineralogical variations in the rock are accentuated. Thus, less
resistant minerals or bands within a facet will become preferentially attacked, forming
sometimes complex etching patterns. For example, abrasion can pick out foliation
structures producing flute-like features, whether or not the foliation is parallel to the wind
direction. Laity (1994) notes that, unlike flutes and grooves, aeolian etching patterns can
be irregular.

Chapter 2: Aeolian Features

Pits
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Pits (also called re-entrants and salients by Cooke et al., 1993) appear to result from
abrasion attacking pre-existing heterogeneities in the rock surfaces, such as cracks, less
resistant mineral grains, or vesicles. Pits are defined by Laity (1994) as closed
depressions, often of irregular shape. According to Greeley and Iverson (1985) pits form
most commonly on windward facets inclined at between 55o and 90o to the wind.
However, at the SEM scale Whitney (1979) identifies vortex pits as being produced by
dust impacts within vortices affecting leeward facets, but such pits have not been
recorded at the visible scale. Vortex pits appear to differ from sand-abraded pits because
of the presence in the former of fine-textured dendritic abrasion within the pits (see Breed
et al., 1997, Fig. 446). Pits may also be oriented at an angle to the surface on which they
are developed. Christiansen (2004) notes elongated pits on Antarctic rock surfaces which
form parallel to wind direction as a transitional feature between pits and grooves.

Chapter 2: Aeolian Features

Helical scores
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Relatively uncommon features, helical scores are corkscrew shaped depressions which
deepen and spiral in a downwind direction, terminating in a sharp point. They have been
recorded, for example, on marble in the Mojave Desert, California (Laity, 1995). Their
genesis is uncertain, but they are thought to evolve from grooves or flutes and be
produced under very high wind velocities. Similar forms (compound parallel-sided
furrows) are also noted in fluvial systems (Richardson and Carling, 2005).

marble in central Namib Desert. Image

Chapter 2: Aeolian Features

Projections (fingers, knobs and ridges)
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Projecting fingers are observed on very abraded facets, where small patches of highly
resistant minerals have withstood abrasion in comparison with the surrounding surface. In
some cases a visible inclusion can be seen at the top of the knob or finger, which has
protected the underlying surface from erosion. Alternative names for these features
include ‘collar studs’ (Powers, 1936) and ‘dedos’ (McCauley et al., 1979). Highly
resistant mineral veins within rocks may also withstand abrasion to produce projecting
ridges.

Chapter 2: Aeolian Features

Smoothing and polishing
Scale: mm to m
Feature description:
Smoothing and polishing of facets is one of the most commonly observed features
associated with wind abrasion. Polish can occur across whole facets and also within flutes
and grooves. The degree of polishing is a good indication of the relative age of the
ventifact although rates vary with lithology (Laity, 1995). Wind polishing can produce
glassy surfaces on suitable lithologies (Christiansen, 2004). Smoothing and polishing can
also result from fluvial abrasion (see Fig. F5).

Basal sill
Scale: cm
Feature description:
Towards the base of larger ventifacts and rocks there is often a zone with minimal
abrasion features developed, where soil or debris has protected the rock from abrasion.
This produces a step or sill-like feature at the base of a facet. These sills can also form in
aggressive weathering environments (see Fig. W19).

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Introduction
In this chapter, we describe morphological features that are present on fluvial clasts. The
features are typical of rivers from all flow and climatic regions. Sedimentary facies that
contain such clasts include floodplains, terraces, channel beds, channel bars and alluvial
fans. The clasts of interest in this atlas are cobble size and larger (i.e. >6.4 cm
intermediate axis).
Cobbles, along with other sediment sizes, usually enter the fluvial system through lower
order tributaries or can be eroded from adjacent (often, but not always, alluvial)
sediments. In steep upstream reaches or areas of bedrock confinement, clasts may be
delivered directly from canyon walls (e.g., by toppling, avalanche or landslide Howard,
1998) or by block quarrying (plucking) from in-channel bedrock exposures (Tinkler and
Wohl, 1998). Boulders and megaclasts (> 4.1 m, Blair and McPherson, 1999) are
sometimes introduced in this way. They may also be the remnant load of a palaeo- higher
magnitude, flow regime (e.g., glacial outwash). In many rivers on Earth these large
boulders and megaclasts are now ‘non-transported’, that is, they are stable relative to the
surrounding bedload under the current flow regime (Richardson and Carling, 2005).
Megaclasts that are positioned within the channel develop a myriad of features that are
similar to bedrock bedforms (Richardson and Carling, 2005). Canyon wall collapse or
impact by clasts during high magnitude floods may introduce smaller fragments of
fluvially sculpted bedrock into the channel. In this way, clasts with erosional features that
were formed on a relatively stable bedrock surface may be incorporated into the channel
as bedload. Although we include some of these features in this atlas (i.e., potholes and
flutes), a recent review of bedrock channel forms by Richardson and Carling (2005) has
identified approximately 140 features, all of which could potentially exist on introduced
clasts. Readers are encouraged to consult that publication for further detail.
The mobilization of fluvial sediments often alters the surface morphology of clasts, and
this chapter is primarily concerned with these features. Fluvial sediment is transported in
three ways: wash, suspension and traction (Richards, 1982). Cobbles and larger size
clasts generally tend to be transported as traction load. However, if the flow magnitude is
sufficiently strong, they may be transported in suspension (e.g., Ritter, 1975). Traction
load is generally moved by dragging and saltation. Transport of clasts in this way subjects
them to percussion, grinding and abrasion, causing clasts to split, fracture and become
polished (Kuenen, 1956; Marshall, 1927).
Previous investigators have cited rounding (Howard, 1998), polishing, smoothing,
fracturing and fissuring (Marshall, 1927) as indirect evidence of fluvial transport. In
addition to these we have identified another thirteen signatures of fluvial transport. Eight
of the additional features are related to percussion events. Such features include:
percussion-fracture facet, percussion-fracture ridges (distal and proximal), bulb of
percussion, radial fissure, undulation, hertzian cone, incipient cone, and termination. Pits,
although related to percussion events, are not related to percussion fracture generation
and are discussed separately. The remaining features, striations and scratches, potholes,
and flutes, are primarily related to abrasion events. Many of the features described in this
24

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

chapter are not, of themselves, diagnostic of a fluvial environment. For example,
percussion fracture features are also found on ejecta and colluvial clasts that have been
subjected to percussion.
Percussion Terminology
The term ‘percussion fracture’ requires explanation. For the purpose of this atlas,
percussion impact refers to any collision between a clast and another clast or bedrock. If a
certain set of conditions are met during a percussion event, a percussion fracture may
result. Cotterell and Kamminga (1987) identify three types of percussion fractures:
conchoidal, bending, and wedging. Of these, conchoidal fractures appear to be the most
relevant when considering geological processes.
Geological literature, to our knowledge, does not provide a terminology for describing
conchoidal fracturing. Archaeologists, on the other hand, have devoted considerable
effort to understanding such fractures (Andrefsky, 1994; Whittaker, 1994) because the
technology permitted hominids, for over 2.5 million years, to systematically reduce stone
into tools with sharp cutting edges (Fig. F1). As the principles of physics that govern
percussion flaking are the same whether a human action, flood event, or gravity causes
two rocks to collide, many of the terms used herein are borrowed or adapted from
archaeological literature.
Conchoidal fractures are a special case of percussion fracture in which a cone-shaped
stress wave passes through a rock resulting in the detachment of a flake from a core (Fig.
F2). In rare instances, the detached flake will take the form of a cone known as a hertzian
cone. But, conchoidal fractures do not always completely propagate, creating crescentic
surface depressions known as incipient cones or ring cracks. If a conchoidal fracture fully
propagates on the margin of a clast, a partial hertzian cone is formed and a flake is
detached from the core (Fig. F2). The conchoidal fracture manifests on the core as a
concave facet and on the flake as a convex facet.
Conchoidal fracture faces are associated with a host of related sub-features. These sub
features present important diagnostic criteria for identifying and analyzing percussion
events. When considered in combination with other clast features, conchoidal fracture
features can provide evidence of percussion that may indicate fluvial transport processes.
A limited number of formal and informal archaeological experiments and ethnographic
observations have shed light on the complex set of variables that influence clast fractures
(Cotterell and Kamminga, 1987; Dibble and Whittaker, 1981; Speth, 1972; Speth, 1974;
Speth, 1975; Speth, 1981).
The current state of knowledge allows for a few concrete statements about the
relationships between percussion fracture variables. First, all else being equal, lithology
will affect the nature of the fracture. Rocks such as chert, flint, rhyolite and basalt are
relatively brittle, elastic and homogenous, and are more likely to propagate a percussion
fracture. Coarser, less homogeneous rocks such as granite are less conducive to
conchoidal fracturing at the clast scale. Given a particular mineralogy, the next most
important factor affecting flake morphology is collision and core geometry. Conchoidal

25

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

fractures most-often occur on the acute edges of clasts at an acute striking angle relative
to the striking platform (Fig. F3). In general, the closer the platform angle is to 90°, the
greater the flake length (Speth, 1981). Platform angles greater than 90° deter the
propagation of percussion fractures. Finally, and perhaps most intuitively, striking force
plays a key role in the morphology of percussion fractures (Dibble and Whittaker, 1981;
Speth, 1972; Speth, 1974). Given a particular mineralogy and collision geometry, greater
striking forces will produce larger percussion fractures. These three simple relationships
between flake morphology and mineralogy, geometry, and force are fundamental to
understanding how percussion fractures occur on clasts.

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Rounding
Scale: clast
Feature description:
Clast roundness is perhaps the most cited indicator of fluvial transport. Abrasion (also
known as corrasion) involves the mechanical erosion of rocks by numerous impacts from
other sediment particles transported in the fluid. These particles may be carried in
suspension or as bedload, or both. Each impact, if sufficiently energetic, breaks off a
small piece of the surface. This may be at the scale of a small part of a grain (in the case
of suspended load), or as much as a substantial chip of rock in the case of coarse bedload
(Richardson and Carling, 2005). Factors that influence roundness are the particle form
and the concentration and characteristics of other particles in transport. In fluvial systems,
sand acts as an abrasive agent when transported with gravel particles, causing them to
round quickly. Roundness increases with transport distance and particle size and decrease
with hardness (Allen, 1985).

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Polishing and smoothing
Scale: clast and facet
Feature description:
Suspended sediment can abrade clasts to form extremely smooth, shiny and sometimes
gently undulating surfaces (Baker and Kale, 1998; Baker and Pickup, 1987; Hancock et
al., 1998; Wohl and Ikeda, 1998). Although individual clasts can be polished, this
phenomenon is more often observed on large non-transported clasts and introduced
bedrock clasts which were already polished. It is found on hard, dense medium and fine
grained textured clasts (e.g., medium sandstone and finer) (Richardson and Carling,
2005).

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Fissure
Scale: clast and facet
Feature description:
The presence of fissures, where cracks can be seen on the rock surface, but without
complete detachment, is common in fluvial environments. Fissures can form from
multiple causes (e.g., weathering, ballistic impact, rock structure etc.) and are found in
many geomorphic environments (fluvial, ejecta, talus slopes etc.). In fluvial
environments, fissures result from impact with other transported clasts or by impact
against immobile clasts or bedrock. These ballistic forces may also exploit pre-existing
structural fissures.

Creek Canyon, Arizona. Large fissure bisects

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Broken and split clasts
Scale: clast and facet
Feature description:
In fluvial systems, clasts can be broken into more angular shapes as a result of crushing
between larger stones, and impact. For megaclasts (> 4.1 m, Blair and McPherson, 1999)
and boulders that are transported infrequently, this is often the primary mechanism of
physical breakdown. The resultant clast shape often has a sub-rounded to well-rounded
facet that appears truncated by an angular, often intensely roughened, facet (see Fig. F7).
Malarz (2005) reported that the proportion of broken and split clasts increased after flood
events in two streams in the Carpathian mountains by >14% at all sample sites and as
much as 49% at one site.

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Percussion fracture facets (concave and convex)
Scale: facet
Feature description:
During fluvial transport, clasts may collide with sufficient force to propagate percussion
fractures (Fig. F2). Clast breakage by percussion, particularly on fine-grained rocks,
creates smooth, shell-like convexities and concavities. These curvilinear facets may have
secondary morphologies on their surface (e.g., radial fissures, undulation marks) and
these are described as sub-features following percussion fracture facets. Curvilinear
facets were commonly observed on the basalt boulders at the Oak Creek Canyon field site
in Arizona.
The size, angularity, and shape of a clast surface will affect the morphology of percussion
fractures and their sub-features. It is generally thought that the angle at which two
adjacent facets meet controls the fracture type. For example platform angles less than 90°
are more conducive to the propagation of percussion fractures. Obtuse angles deter
percussion fractures except in optimal situations in which exceptionally brittle, elastic
stone is percussed with a relatively large amount of force.
The superposition and patina of percussion fracture faces may also provide useful
evidence for the relative sequence of percussion events. Facets that crosscut fracture
ridges are the result of subsequent percussion events. In addition, conchoidal fracturing
exposes fresh, un-oxidized surfaces. If there is a measurable difference in the degree of
patination between two percussion fracture facets, it is reasonable to infer separate
events.

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Incipient cone
Scale: cm
Feature description:
Crescent or circular-shaped fractures form surface depressions as a result of clast impact.
They often occur as rings that are 5-10 cm in diameter. In fluvial settings, the rounded
geometry of clasts combined with relatively low-velocity collisions that often occur
during transport, prevent percussion fractures from fully propagating. In these situations,
a surface of relatively shallow crescent-shaped depressions is formed. These features are
surface manifestations of subsurface hertzian cones (see below), hence they are termed
incipient cones. In the fluvial literature, a second hypothesis for the presence of incipient
cones is that they are caused
by cavitation (see fig. 141a
and b in Richardson and
Carling, 2005). However,
erosion of rock by cavitation
in natural bedrock settings is
not thought to be significant,
as the natural roughness of the
channel may substantially
aerate the flow and inhibit
cavitation (Hancock et al.,
1998).
Incipient cones are persistent
features on rock surfaces, as
they are zones of weakness
and therefore locations of
enhanced
weathering
(chemical and physical). As a
result, their surface patterns
become emphasized with
time. In addition, as the
fractures extend in a cone
shape into the rock (mm to
cm), the weathering can
continue at depth.

Hertzian cone
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Hertzian cones may be formed when the impact force is particularly high (Whittaker,
1994). In some rare instances, the full expression of a hertzian cone may be exposed on
the surface of a clast, but more often only a portion of the cone is exposed (see Fig. F11).
Typically, the hertzian cone remains in the subsurface (see incipient cones). Hertzian
cones are also reported in the aeolian literature to describe abrasion marks at the micron
scale from sand grain-to-grain impact (Greeley and Iversen, 1985; Marshall, 1979).

River Gorge in central Australia. Note how the proximal end of the cone articulates with
a circular depression on the surface. Image produced by R. Haas.

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Percussion fracture ridge
Scale: facet
Feature description:
Percussion fractures are framed by ridges that define the extent of the fracture. These
ridges are formed where a conchoidal facet intersects the original clast surface or another
facet. In general, the angularity of the ridge, which can range from sharp to muted, is
inversely related to the age of the percussion event as they are relatively susceptible to
rounding. Facet ridges also influence the shape and path of subsequent percussion
fractures as later impact fractures preferentially follow existing ridges. If there are no
ridges to guide the force of percussion, then the percussion fractures will tend to fan out
rapidly (Fig. F9). There are two general types of percussion fracture ridges: proximal and
distal.
Proximal ridges result from the initiation of the percussion event. They are oriented
roughly 90° to the percussion axis. The profile view of a proximal ridge is always acute
for the core and obtuse for the flake (Cotterell and Kamminga, 1987). As a result, the
proximal ridges often create surfaces amenable to subsequent percussion events (see Figs.
F13 and F15).
Distal ridges are created where the force of percussion terminates. A series of distal
ridges on the surface of a clast indicate multiple, often overlapping, percussion facets.
Distal ridges on flakes almost always create angles of less than 90°, whereas those on
cores are almost always greater than 90°. The importance of this is that sharper angled
ridges on flakes have a tendency to round more quickly in fluvial environments and may
explain the relative paucity of flakes in these environments.

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Bulb of Percussion
Scale: sub-facet
Feature description:
A single bulb of percussion is almost always evident in a conchoidal fracture facet. On
the proximal end of the concave facet of a core, the bulb of percussion describes a
prominent dish-shaped surface (Fig. F13). The bulb represents a partial hertzian cone,
which is responsible for initiating the conchoidal fracture. This feature always begins at
the point of initiation and fans outward toward the distal end. Often the bulb of
percussion terminates partway down the conchoidal fracture face, as in figure F15, but
sometimes the bulb comprises the entire conchoidal fracture face (Fig. F13). For every
concave bulb of percussion on a core, there is (or was) a conjugate flake with a convex
bulb of percussion.

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Terminations
Scale: sub-facet
Feature description:
The morphology of a distal ridge varies according to the type of percussion termination.
The interplay of many factors including impact geometry and force, surface morphology,
and mineralogy affects the way a conchoidal facet terminates. There are three general
types of percussion terminations (Cotterell and Kamminga, 1987): straight, outcurved or
incurved (see Fig. F3). Outcurved terminations curve away from the mass of the clast and
can be one of two types, hinge or step.
Hinge terminations are curvilinear and occur when the force of percussion abruptly but
smoothly curves away from the mass of the core.
Step terminations are angular and occur when the flake breaks at a right angle to the facet
plane. Step terminations typically occur when there is insufficient force to propagate a
flake or where relatively low-angle, fragile rock surfaces have insufficient mass to bear
the load of the percussion event. The latter situation is common on proximal ridges (Fig.
F13).
Hinge and step terminations create topographic irregularities that deter subsequent
percussion fractures from fully propagating. The result is that step fractures can “pile up”
behind the initial step fracture. The accumulation is called stacking (see Fig. F15).
Terminations are not mutually exclusive, as the length of a single distal ridge may include
multiple termination types. The lateral margin of a percussion facet always has at least
some length of feather termination, but the ridge at the distal end of the flake may exhibit
multiple terminations.

Radial fissures

Radial fissures emanate from the point of impact in a radiating pattern and are the surface
manifestation of a radiating shockwave. They tend to be topographically more prominent
on relatively coarse-grained structures such as those in Figures F16 and F17.

Undulations1
Scale: sub-facet
Feature description:
Undulations are concentric ridges that originate from the initiation point of a percussion
fracture. They are aligned perpendicular to the direction of impact. Often, undulations
have the greatest amplitude close to the impact point and frequency decreases with
distance. However this needs to be tested with more field observations. Trends may be
complex as multiple, embedded undulations can occur on the same facet.

These features are known as ripples in the archaeology literature, but the use of that term in this context is
not appropriate given its existing use in fluvial and aeolian literature.

41

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Percussion pits
Scale: clast
Feature description:
Percussion events often crush the mineralogical structure of the surface, resulting in pits
(Figs. F7 and F19). These features occur in relatively non-brittle and/or heterogeneous
materials. Some lithologies, e.g., sandstone, will not usually propagate a percussion
fracture. Instead, impacts tend to dislodge sand grains and leave a depression. However
pits can co-occur with percussion fractures. Often, some degree of crushing may be
evident at the initiation point of a percussion fracture. On stable clasts, the circular or
ovoid planform may become modified by erosion focused on the downstream lip, and the
percussion pits may become loci for incipient flute development (Richardson and
Carling, 2005).

pits. Note step terminations at edge of percussion pits. Image courtesy of M. Bourke.

Striations/scratches
Scale: cm wide, mm deep
Feature description:
Rock striations, also known as tool marks, are formed on mobile clasts as they slide over
protrusions (clasts and bedock) in the channel bed (Fig. F20). They also form on
stationary clasts and bedrock by moving clasts. Striations are typically a few cm in length
and commonly occur in groups which can be i) arranged simply, ii) aligned but not
parallel or iii) in parallel, looped or arcuate pattern (Fig. F21) (see also Richardson and
Carling, 2005). Occasionally they may form deeper rills (Bourke, 1990). Striations are
also observed on rocks that have been glacially transported, but these can be
distinguished from fluvial features by analysis of micro-features (e.g., Van Hoesen and
Orndorff, 2004).

Pothole
Scale: cm to m
Feature description:
These are widely reported features in bedrock channels (e.g., Baker and Pickup, 1987;
Whipple et al., 2000; Wohl, 1993; Wohl and Achyuthan, 2002). They are essentially
circular (in plan view) deep depressions which are eroded by vortices (Richardson and
Carling, 2005). They are common in constricted channel reaches and may take 103 yr to
form in resistant rock (Wohl, 1998). They are often associated with joints, fractures and
small channel bed irregularities (Hancock et al., 1998). Potholes may evolve from the
more rounded of the flute forms as erosion is focused downward rather than headward
where vertical vortices act to selectively erode the flute bottom (Hancock et al., 1998).
Although potholes are not likely to form on transported clasts, they may enter the channel
bedload system by erosion (undercutting, plucking) of bedrock.

Chapter 3: Fluvial Features

Flutes
Scale: cm
Feature description:
Flutes form on megaclasts and bedrock from abrasion by suspended load (Baker and
Pickup, 1987; Gupta et al., 1999; Hancock et al., 1998; Whipple et al., 2000). In bedrock
channels they are often well developed on the top of bedrock protrusions and the crest of
large boulders. They are very well developed on fine grained rock and are associated with
joints, fractures and small bed irregularities. Similar to their aeolian counterpart (see Figs.
A7-A11), fluvial flutes are closed at the upstream end. They are thought to migrate in an
upstream direction and occasionally have a more rounded rather than elongated shape.
Hancock et al (1998) attributed this to a diminished strength of flow separation due to
changes in the feature itself or in the surrounding bed. Flutes are poorly described in the
fluvial literature and a comparative analysis with aeolian features is yet to be undertaken.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Introduction
Mechanical, chemical and biological weathering processes all leave a range of clear
morphological signatures on boulder surfaces. On Earth, weathering features produced in
arid (hot and cold) and urban environments have been particularly well observed and
categorized, and the major features identified from such extreme terrestrial environments
are probably the most useful analogues for geomorphological interpretation on other
planets. Often, combinations of weathering processes appear to act together or in
sequence, to produce the observed breakdown features. This breakdown takes place
predominantly in situ and movement of weathered materials is local and confined largely
to the rock location. Even the unconsolidated rock residue may continue to break down in
place until an end product, essentially in equilibrium with the environment, is formed.
Many of the features assumed to be produced by weathering also have, perhaps
superficial, visual similarities to those produced by aeolian processes.
Mechanical weathering involves the breakdown of rock material into smaller pieces
without any change in the chemistry or mineralogy of the rock. Disintegration of rock
material is achieved by the generation of forces within the rock mass. These forces are
derived either from the growth of materials in voids (predominantly by frost action or the
growth of salt crystals and occasionally by organic growths) or the internal expansion of
rocks and minerals. The physical weathering processes associated with internal expansion
include thermal expansion, unloading, hydration, wetting and drying, organic expansion
and salt weathering (Dixon, 2004).
Chemical weathering processes are those which involve the chemical and or
mineralogical transformation of rocks and minerals into products that are more in
equilibrium with surface conditions. Several principal chemical weathering processes are
recognized including solution (dissolution), hydrolysis, hydration, carbonation, chelation
and redox reactions (oxidation and reduction) (Dixon, 2004).
Biological weathering by plants, lichens, algae and bacteria represents a significant
contribution to the chemical weathering of rocks and minerals, primarily due to the fact
that it produces abundant quantities of organic acids. On Earth most rock surfaces have
some covering of micro-organisms in the form of a biofilm; although these do not always
contribute to rock breakdown and may in fact form a bioprotective layer preventing other
weathering agents from reacting with the rock (Carter and Viles, 2005).
In most environmental settings weathering processes act in combination and often
synergistically. For example, physical weathering produces cracks and flakes, causing an
increase in reactive surface area available for chemical weathering.
See Dorn and Cherveny (2005) for other useful images of weathering features.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Rounded clast
Scale: clast
Feature description:
Rounded clasts can be produced by intense weathering. Chemical weathering within soils
and deep weathering mantles in humid tropical areas has often been seen to produce
rounded ‘corestones’ of ‘spheroidal weathering’ on rocks such as granite. However, such
rounded blocks can also be produced within shallow soils and saprolites as recorded in
southern Sweden (Lidmar-Bergstrom et al., 1997), the Sudetes, and Nova Scotia (Migon,
1999). Exfoliations caused by salt weathering and other processes within arid areas can
also produce rounded rocks (as shown in Fig. W1). Lithological control (including
fracture density and pattern) is probably important – some rock types (e.g., granitoid and
basaltic rocks) are more likely to produce rounded residual boulders than others. Rounded
clasts can also be produced by a range of other rock breakdown processes including
abrasion during fluvial transport.

Angular clast
Scale: clast
Feature description:
Weathering by freeze-thaw action in periglacial areas is often assumed to produce
angular clasts as is weathering in hot deserts (Cooke et al., 1993). Physical weathering
processes, such as freeze-thaw and salt weathering often cause flaking and spalling of the
surface which can create angular residual clasts. Lithological control is probably critical
to the exact shape produced from such processes with fracture density and pattern an
important control, and not all clasts weathered by freeze-thaw are angular (e.g., Hall and
Hall, 1991). Furthermore, as a very wide range of breakdown processes may produce
angular clasts it is a difficult clast property to use confidently as diagnostic of any
particular process regime.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Split rock
Scale: clast
Feature description:
Intense physical weathering can enhance pre-existing weaknesses (such as fractures or
joints) within boulders and produce split rocks (called Kernsprunge in German). Within
deserts, many 19th century explorers reported hearing ‘pistol shots’ at night and finding
split rocks the next morning, suggesting that dramatic cracking may occur under intense
heating and cooling regimes. Lightning and fire have also been reported to produce split
rocks (Dorn, 2003). Under experimental conditions such processes have been hard to
reproduce, and moisture may be necessary to encourage splitting. Ollier (1971) also notes
that split rocks can be produced by unloading affecting corestones within a weathered
rock layer. The processes responsible for split rocks may be scale-dependent: larger split
blocks may be produced by unloading, whereas smaller split blocks are likely to be
formed by physical weathering. However, boulder to boulder collisions or impacts may
also cause split rocks, so care needs to be taken in diagnosing the setting of the split rock
before a confident identification of the formative process regime can be made.

plain here are affected by intense heating and cooling as well as salt weathering. Image

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Pedestal/undercut rock
Scale: clast
Feature description:
In several rock types weathering may become concentrated at the base of boulders,
producing undercutting and the development of small pedestals. They are also referred to
as mushroom rocks, flared rocks, balanced rocks and perched blocks although there is
some terminological confusion between boulders with true pedestals and those that are
simply resting on a surface (Twidale, 2004). Undercut rocks are particularly well
developed in sandstone, limestone and granite. The causes for such features are hotly
debated, with some workers ascribing them to enhanced weathering below a cover of soil
or sediment which has subsequently been removed. Others, however, implicate aeolian
processes or shadow weathering (Schattenverwitterung) in producing the undercut
elements, without any need for a former soil or sediment covering. Twidale (2004)
provides a good review of the debate. It is most probable that several different process
combinations could produce such features.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Doughnut rock
Scale: clast
Feature description:
Rounded boulders can become hollowed out in the middle to produce an annular-shaped
clast. The processes responsible have not been described (as far as we are aware), and the
only observations we can find of such features are from the Atacama Desert, Chile and
Antarctica. Such features should not be confused with the ‘rock doughnuts’ observed on
some granite outcrops, which are pits surrounded by a raised rim (Campbell, 1997).
Morris et al., (1972) described ‘potholes’ in sandstone in the dry valleys in Antarctica.
They suggest that the holes are enlarged by freeze-thaw action of snow melt that has
collected in a hollow. They do not speculate on how they are initiated. Perhaps the
features in Figures W 6 and W7 are examples of breached ‘potholes’. Similar pot hole
morphologies are formed by fluvial processes (see Fig. F22 & F23).

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Microsolutional features
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Small, often dendritic and curvilinear rills or grooves are found on rock surfaces. Their
occurrence is restricted to soluble rocks within arid environments. They were first
described by Lowdermilk and Woodruff (1932) who named them ‘rillensteine’. It is
hypothesized that these features are produced through chemical weathering where water
availability is low, thus only small features result. Often they are found on ventifacts. It
has been suggested that wind-driven films might, on occasion, produce rillensteine with
preferential orientations to prevailing winds (e.g., Maxson, 1940). A whole suite of
similar features can be observed which are miniature versions of the karren features
found on soluble rocks under humid conditions. (see Fig. 21.4 in Cooke et al., 1993).

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Weathering grooves/rills
Scale: cm
Feature description:
Most grooves or rills produced by weathering are part of the suite of karren features
developed as a result of solution of soluble rocks. They are most commonly noted on
carbonate rocks, but can, in fact, develop on any soluble rocks such as gypsum and halite.
They are usually found on steeply dipping surfaces and consist of a collection of parallel
grooves, with U shaped cross-profiles. Each groove is separated from its neighbor by a
sharp edge. They start at the crest of a slope or facet and die out downslope. Widths are
characteristically 1 – 3 cm and length is some 10s of cm. Sweeting and Lancaster (1982)
discuss their occurrence alongside aeolian grooves and flutes on carbonate rocks in the
central Namib Desert. Similar grooves produced by weathering are also found on
granitoid rocks and sandstones, although in this case solutional processes are probably
not the dominant formative agent (Migon, 2006; Twidale, 1982). Many of the grooves on
sandstones and granitic rocks are much larger than rillenkarren found on limestone.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Micropitting
Scale: mm – cm
Feature description:
On many different rock types small pits can be produced by chemical and biological
weathering, often developing from microscale irregularities within the rock surface which
may be lithologically controlled (e.g., vesicles in basalt). Lichen fruiting bodies, for
example, are known to form small circular depressions in limestones (Danin and Garty,
1983).

Weathering pits
Scale: cm to m
Feature description:
A whole range of names have been applied to pits produced by weathering (e.g.,
gnamma, opferkessel, pias, vasques) which can occur over a wide range of scales and are
found on many different rock types. On soluble rocks, such as limestone, such features
are often ascribed to dissolution, and are found in association with other karren features,
and given names such as kamenitza. Weathering pits have also been extensively recorded
on granite and similar rocks, ranging in diameter from 15-20 cm to a few meters (Migoń,
2006). Large weathering pits may have overhanging or flared sidewalls. There is still
much discussion on how pits develop in rocks that produce insoluble weathering residue.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Granular disintegration
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Granular disintegration is, strictly speaking, a type of breakdown process whereby
weathering of various sorts (solution of soluble cement, stress induced by volumetric
expansion, release of residual stress, water adsorption (Nicholson, 2004)) acts to detach
individual grains from a rock surface, usually producing a roughened surface. The
product is often loose, coarse grained debris which can easily be removed by erosional
agents such as wind, water or gravity. This form of rock breakdown occurs commonly in
coarse grained rocks such as sandstone, dolerite and granite. Clay-rich sandstones are
thought to be particularly susceptible (Smith et al., 1994). Granular disintegration
produces a very similar effect to differential weathering in poly-mineral rocks, whereby
particularly susceptible minerals are preferentially weathered out creating a pitted or
roughened surface. Sparks (1971), shows an example where rhomb-shaped phenocrysts
of feldspar have been weathered out from a boulder in Norway leaving a roughened
surface.

coarse granitoid rock, NW Namibia. Image courtesy of H. Viles.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Alveoli or honeycombs
Scale: cm
Feature description:
Alveoli are small (less than about 1m) cavernous weathering features which usually occur
in groups. Individual alveoli are separated from their neighbors by narrow, intricate walls,
creating an overall honeycombed surface. Many different weathering processes have been
implicated in their formation, and they occur in a wide range of terrestrial environments
(e.g., coastal outcrops, Antarctica and hot deserts). Alveoli commonly form on large
boulders and can cover whole facets. Their initiation and outline shape may be
constrained by lithological variations, but they appear to develop by positive feedback in
that once a hollow is initiated it creates an environment in which weathering is favored
(Smith and McAlister, 1986).

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Tafoni
Scale: m.
Feature description:
Tafoni are large (usually over 1m in diameter) cavernous weathering features. Often
developed towards the base of large boulders, they are characterized by having a flaking
backwall (when actively forming), and an overhanging lip in front. The opening of the
tafoni is often near-circular. They are a common feature of deserts, semi-arid regions and
near coasts or anywhere salts can precipitate from dew or fog (Mustoe, 1982; Young,
1987). They occur in a wide range of lithologies but particularly in medium and coarse
grained granites, sandstones and limestones. They are thought to be the result of flaking
and granular disintegration (caused by hydration, salt crystalisation and chemical attack
caused by saline solutions, Goudie, 2004a). Some tafoni have overhanging visors or rims
that partly enclose the opening. In permeable sandstones, volcaniclastic rocks, and
limestone, secondary cementation by precipitates in the outer layers may contribute to the
resistant visors (Bloom, 1998; Martini, 1978). Tafoni have been recorded as developing
over periods of around 104 yrs in Arizona, but very different rates of formation may occur
in other areas (Norwick and Dexter, 2002).

Basal hollow (‘shark’s fin’ weathering)
Scale: cm
Feature description:
In many arid environments, especially where the surficial sediments are salt-rich,
weathering is concentrated in the near-surface zone. Below the surface, and within a
blanket of sediment, boulder surfaces are relatively pristine and unweathered. However, a
highly aggressive weathering environment is found at the surface. This zone often
produces accelerated weathering and the formation of a basal hollow.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Flaking
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
Flaking surfaces are produced where a range of weathering processes acts to remove
sections of the near-surface layer. The lithological characteristics of the rock often
determine the size and nature of the flakes removed, which can vary from tiny, thin mm
to cm sized flakes. Layered and foliated rocks are particularly susceptible to flaking, as
are those where surface crusts have developed. Migoń (2006) defines flakes on granite as
being less than 1 cm thick.

63

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Spalling
Scale: cm to m
Feature description:
Spalling is the peeling off of platy fragments from the surface of a rock. It is
differentiated from flaking merely by being larger. Often parts of the surface of boulders,
some 10s of cm in diameter and generally 1-5 cm in thickness, become detached by a
combination of weathering processes. Migoń (2006) defines granite spalls as being
between 1 and 30 cm thick, and up to 5 m2 in surface area. Layered, foliated, crusted or
case hardened rocks are particularly susceptible to spalling. Lithological controls,
coupled with suitable penetration of water and temperature fluctuations, may determine
whether rocks suffer flaking or spalling. Spalling may be accompanied by surface
alteration or case hardening.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Multiple splits
Scale: cm
Feature description:
Instead of merely suffering from surface loss, as is the case for rocks affected by granular
disintegration, flaking and spalling, some (especially small) clasts can break down as a
result of the development of one, or more commonly a suite of, parallel fractures cutting
through the whole rock (like a sliced loaf of bread). Such split rocks have been described
in many deserts and differential receipt of solar radiation may be an important cause
(McFadden et al., 2005). Multiple splits have also been observed on high latitude coasts,
ascribed to hydration (P. Migoń, pers. comm.).

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Cracks and polygonal cracking
Scale: mm – m
Feature description:
Cracks or fissures may form in clasts and boulders for a number of reasons (differential
expansion with pressure release; thermal expansion and contraction; growth of foreign
crystals in cracks and pores (Bloom, 1998)), but weathering and displacive growth of
secondary minerals may be a particularly important cause of fissuring in arid areas.
Where joints and linear planes of weakness exist in rocks, salt weathering and the growth
of gypsum may cause these to become clearly fissured and forced apart. Ollier (1965)
proposed a mechanism called ‘dirt cracking’ whereby dust blowing into cracks induced
by thermal expansion and contraction reinforces the development of the cracks. Hall and
Hall (1991) proposed that fracture patterns can reveal something about the formative
processes responsible, drawing an analogy between the hierarchical crack patterns with
90o angles between crack sets found on high altitude boulders with those produced in
thermal shock experiments on ceramics. Sandstones, granites and more rarely basalts,
andesites and limestones sometimes show distinctive patterning by networks of shallow
cracks joining at around 120o angles to produce polygons (Williams and Robinson,
1989). The cracks are often shallow (usually less than 1 cm) and the resultant polygons
are usually around 10 cm in diameter. Polygonal cracking (also known as pachydermal
weathering, elephant skin and tortoise shell, Thomas et al., 2005) occurs commonly in
hot dryland environments, but is also reported from the humid temperate zone. A number
of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the development of polygonal cracking,
such as thermal expansion and contraction, frost weathering or wetting and drying, but
none
satisfactorily
explain all occurrences.
Williams and Robinson
(1989) propose that case
hardening is an essential
precursor to polygonal
cracking.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Case hardening
Scale: mm to cm thick, several cm2
Feature description:
Many rock types, including sandstone, granite and limestone, are prone to hardening of
the near-surface layer, thought to be caused by migration of pore fluids, which then
evaporate and leave behind soluble minerals. These minerals increase cementation within
this near-surface layer, causing a hardened skin to develop. Case hardening is often
important in the development of subsequent weathering features, such as polygonal
cracking. Micro-organisms have been seen to play a role in case hardening in some cases,
but purely chemical processes may also be involved (Viles and Goudie, 2005).

Calcite crusts
Scale: mm to cm
Feature description:
In areas where there is abundant calcium carbonate, precipitation on the surfaces
(especially the undersides) of boulders can occur. The calcite crust is often complexly
textured, with cauliflower–like growths common. Other minerals may also be
precipitated in crusts, such as gypsum (dominantly in arid environments), calcium nitrate
(sometimes called caliche and found in hyper-arid environments) or silica (sometimes
found as silica speleothems in granite terrains). Under some circumstances such crusts
can become displacive and cause cracking of the boulder.

Chapter 4: Weathering Features

Rock varnish
Scale: microns thick, mm to cm2 surface area coverage
Feature description:
Rock varnish is a coating found on many rocks in arid environments, enriched in
manganese and iron, which usually imparts a red or black colouration to the underlying
rock, depending on the detailed chemistry. It is also commonly observed to have a shiny
appearance, probably because of the presence of lustrous minerals and its smooth,
lamellate surface microtexture (Dorn, 1998). Wind abrasion has been observed to
breakdown rock varnish. On the other hand, rock varnish has also been noted to form
over ventifact surfaces, implying a shift in process regimes. Although included in the
weathering chapter, rock varnish is usually thought of as having a largely external source.
Silica glazes have also been observed on many rock surfaces ranging in colour from
translucent to reddish brown or black. Dorn (1998) provides a wide review of many
different types of varnish and rock coatings.

Salt efflorescence/salt tides
Scale: cm
Feature description:
In arid and hyper-arid environments, salts crystallize out of solution easily and may
become deposited on rock surfaces. In the Atacama Desert, on a range of igneous rocks,
two distinctive types of salt accretion have been observed. Firstly, clear cauliflower-like
growths of salts have been found in alveoli. Secondly, salt ‘tides’ – near-horizontal lines
of amorphous salt deposits near the base of boulders (or at the height to which capillary
rise might reach) - have been recorded (Heslop, 2003). Gypsum is also known to form
destructive ‘whiskers’ (J. Clarke, pers. comm.)

Dust coating
Scale: microns thick, cm to m2 surface coverage
Feature description:
As with desert varnish, dust coatings are largely produced by external material adhering
to the surface of a boulder (rather than a product of weathering). However, once formed,
they may react with the underlying surface. Usually recorded as thin, light brown films
on the surface, dust films have only been rarely recorded in the literature (Dorn, 1998).
Dust is commonly entrained in winds in arid and semi-arid areas and the clay sized
particles may easily become accreted on rocks.

Debris apron/grus
Scale: cm to m
Feature description:
Granular disintegration, flaking and other weathering processes produce particulate
debris which, under some circumstances, builds up an apron around the weathering
boulder. The term grus is often used to describe such a covering in which sand and
gravel-sized material dominates (Migon, 2004).
