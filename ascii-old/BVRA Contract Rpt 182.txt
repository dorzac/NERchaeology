ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) performed an archaeological survey
along a one-mile segment of the Greenhouse Road lane addition in western Harris
County, Texas for Harris County on October 3, 2007. William E. Moore was the
Principal Investigator, and Phil Bishop was the Project Archaeologist. This study was
carried out under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit Number 4685 issued by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division. The project area was
investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing. In all, the
project area consisted of three acres. No archaeological sites were found, and no
artifacts were collected. The area was found to be very disturbed prior to the visit by
BVRA. Copies of the final report are housed at the THC, the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
Harris County proposes to add two additional lanes to Greenhouse Road
and a bridge on the west side of the road where it crosses Dinner Creek in western
Harris County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed construction is designed to link
Greenhouse Road to other roads in the area. This network of roads is visible in an
aerial (Figure 2). The footprint of the proposed construction site is approximately
one mile long, and the width of the new lanes, curbs, and bridge will be 25 feet in
width. This totals three acres. The road construction will affect the subsurface to a
depth not greater than 36 inches. In addition, at least 1000 feet of storm sewers will
be installed. These sewers will parallel the road, be placed in a footprint of 24”
wide, and affect the subsurface to a depth of five feet. The entire project area is
located within Harris County and is depicted on the 7.5’ USGS topographic map
Addicks (2295-342), which was drafted in 1970 and photorevised in 1980 (Figure
3). Harris County is the agency permitting this project, and Deborah M. Vaughn,
P.E. is the agency representative. This project falls under the purview of the THC,
since Harris County is a political subdivision of the State of Texas. An
archaeological assessment of the Area of Potential Effect (APE) was required by
the THC. Since Harris County is a public entity, a permit from the THC was
required, and Antiquities Permit 4685 was issued to BVRA by this agency.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The current project area is located in the Western Gulf Coastal Plain
Physiographic Region as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-102). This region is
described as a relatively flat plain underlain by strata that dip Gulfward. These
strata are composed of fluvial, fluvial-deltaic, and shallow marine sediments that
become thicker Gulfward (Fisher et al. 1972). The project area is also located in
the West Gulf Coastal Plain geomorphic unit (Hunt 1974; Walker and Coleman
1987) in which the formations dip gulfward at less than two degrees and crop out
in Gulf-paralleling bands. The surface geologic units in the project area are
Pleistocene and Holocene in age. This project area is located in northwestern
Harris County west of the City of Houston and northwest of Addicks Reservoir. It
consists of a one-mile segment of Greenhouse Road, which crosses Dinner
Creek to the north of its junction with Langham Creek, a tributary of Buffalo
Bayou that drains into the San Jacinto River. At the crossing of Greenhouse
Road, the creek had been channelized (Figure 4). The orange flagging and
wooden stakes mark the right-of-way. The Dinner Creek crossing is depicted in
the Harris County soil survey by Wheeler (1976) on Sheet 65 as being in Katy
fine sandy loam (Kf) soils. This is a nearly level soil found in broad areas on the
coastal prairie. The areas are generally high on the landscape and surround
small depressions. The surface is plane to slightly convex with slopes averaging
about 0.3 percent. The surface layer is friable, medium acid, dark grayish-brown
fine sandy loam about 10 inches thick. The layer below that is friable, medium
acid, brown fine sandy loam that extends to a depth of about 28 inches. Below
the second layer is very firm, slightly acid clay loam mottled with gray, red, strong
brown, and yellowish-brown. This layer extends to a depth of more than 65
inches. This soil is somewhat poorly drained and has a perched water table
above the clay loam layer for short periods in cool months and in periods of
excess rainfall. Surface runoff is slow to very slow, internal drainage is slow, and
permeability is very slow. The available water capacity is high.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to Prehistoric Archeological Sites in Texas: A Statistical
Overview (Biesaart et al. 1985:Figure 15), the project area is located in the
Southeast Texas Cultural-Geographic Region of Texas. In 1985, according to
the overview, there were 1630 recorded sites in the region, making it fifth in the
state. Harris County was the first in the region with 300 recorded sites. All ages
were represented from Paleo-Indian (n=5), Archaic (n=87), and Late Prehistoric
(n=116). Twenty-four sites were eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places are listed in the Register, and 15 sites had been designated as a
State Archeological Landmark. Since 1985, however, the number of recorded
sites has greatly increased, and more than 1030 sites were on file at TARL as of
October 5, 2007 (TARL site files). This increase is due in large part to the
continued development in Harris County and work by the Harris County Flood
Control District.
The Houston Archeological Society has played a large part in locating and
identifying new sites in Harris County as well as conducting testing and
excavation projects. One of the more active members of the society is Leland W.
Patterson who has written numerous articles relating to the archaeology of Harris
County. Some of his more notable works include “Technological Changes in
Harris County” (Patterson 1976), “A Review of the Prehistory of the Upper Texas
Coast (Patterson 1979), “Prehistoric Settlement and Technological Patterns in
Southeast Texas” (Patterson 1983). A bibliography of Southeast Texas was
compiled by William E. Moore (1989). Other major references for this part of the
state include a scholarly book by Lawrence E. Aten (1983), Newcomb (1961),
Story et al. (1990), and Suhm et al. (1954).
The earliest major investigation in the region surrounding the project area
was Wheat’s (1953) survey of the Addicks Basin, located as part of the River
Basin Survey program. A number of sites were excavated and the Galveston
Bay Focus was established on the basis of data recovered from these
excavations (Suhm et al. 1954). The Archaic materials from these sites were
later assigned to the LaHarpe Aspect as defined by LeRoy Johnson, Jr. (1962).
Recent construction in the area has been the catalyst for archaeological
investigations. Much of this work has been performed by Texas A&M University
(Ensor 1984, 1987; Ensor et al. 1983), Moore Archeological Consulting (Moore
1986, 1987; Moore and Sanchez 1992), and Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc.
(Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. 1987; Voellinger 1983; Voellinger et al. 1987),
and Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Fields et al. 1983, 1986; Howard and Freeman
1983).

At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in
the project area, and the Archeological Sites Atlas depicts two previous surveys
involving Dinner Creek. The closest survey to the project area is a large area on
the north side of Dinner Creek less than one mile east of the project area. This
is the project area for a detention basin that was investigated by Moore
Archeological Consulting (Moore and Sanchez 1992). They examined 98 acres
on the north side of the creek and found no sites. Shovel testing revealed sandy
loam to a depth of 30 cm. This was followed by sandy clay loam to 70 cm and
very dense clay at 85 cm. To the east, they examined a 40-acre tract for a
detention basin on Langham Creek. This resulted in the identification of site
41HR729, which is described in their report as a Late Prehistoric ceramic and
lithic scatter buried beneath at least 20 cm of dredged fill. At least 60% of the
site was estimated to be intact, and further work was recommended. To the north
and west of the project area a linear survey is depicted on the Atlas. This survey
found no sites at the crossing of Dinner Creek. There is no information on the
Archeological Sites Atlas for this survey.

CULTURE SEQUENCE
Despite more than a half century of work in developing a culture sequence
for Southeast Texas, considerable debate still exists over the arrangement of
chronological sequences (Meyers 1997:14). Ensor (1991:5-6) believes this lack
of consensus stems largely from the nomenclature and application of projectile
point typologies as well as a dearth of securely stratified sites in the region. The
region lacks extensive sites with unmixed archaeological components. All of the
peoples of Southeast Texas appear to have been nomadic and subsisted
through hunting and gathering (Shafer 1974; Patterson 1995). Agriculture was
never practiced on the Upper Texas Coast, unlike the Caddoan culture area of
Northeast Texas.
The earliest cultures in Southeast Texas are referred to as Paleo-Indians,
and they occupied the area circa 10,000 B.C. to 8000 B.C. In Southeast Texas
this period is not well defined. Clovis points have been found on the surface of
some sites; however, no examples have been recovered from sites with secured
stratigraphic deposits. Hester (1980) suggests that large-scale environmental
changes during the Late Holocene period are responsible for the dearth of PaleoIndian sites in Southeast Texas. He states that these sites, if not destroyed, may
lie offshore on the continental shelf or deeply buried in the floodplains of major
waterways. According to the statistical overview by Biesaart et al. (1985), there
were five recorded Paleo-Indian sites in Harris County in 1985, but this source
does not list site numbers.
The Archaic period in Southeast Texas is generally defined as that time
between the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna and the introduction of
ceramics. The Early and Middle Archaic periods were characterized by
increased climatic aridity and the expansion of prairie habitats (Aten 1983:153).
Population densities in the region appear to have been low and may have even
decreased from Paleo-Indian times. This probably stemmed from a reduction in
available food resources due to the less productive climate. Although sites from
the Early and Middle Archaic periods have been documented along the Upper
Texas Coast, they are rare, and this time period is poorly defined. According to
the statistical overview by Biesaart et al. (1985), there were three recorded Early
Archaic sites and five recorded Middle Archaic sites in Harris County in 1985, but
this source does not list site numbers.

The occurrence of several environmental issues and cultural phenomena
during the Late Archaic period distinguishes it from what is known of the earlier
periods in Southeast Texas (Meyers 1997:16). According to Patterson (1995),
the climate stabilized to its essentially modern state during the Late Archaic. He
believes that food resources were more available and more abundant. Because
of this, population densities increased, and this is evidenced by the proliferation
of Late Archaic sites in the region. According to the statistical overview by
Biesaart et al. (1985), there were 28 recorded Late Archaic sites in Harris County
in 1985, but this source does not list site numbers. Forty-nine sites are listed as
General Archaic.
The Late Prehistoric period is the last period of Southeast Texas
prehistory is generally defined as that time between the introduction of ceramics
and the bow and arrow and contact by Europeans. This period is characterized
by a continued growth in population levels from the Late Archaic period and then
a decline in population towards the end of the Late Prehistoric period. Patterson
(1995:246) suggests that “over-population, perhaps aggravated by climatic
deterioration” may have been partly responsible. According to the statistical
overview by Biesaart et al. (1985), there were 116 recorded Late Prehistoric sites
in Harris County, but this source does not list site numbers.
Proto-historic and historic Indian sites are largely under-documented due
to the lack of non-European diagnostic artifacts for such sites (Meyers 1997:17).
Historic Indian sites are typically identified based on the presence of European
trade goods such as gunflints and beads. According to Patterson (1995:249),
European influence did not disrupt aboriginal habitation of the Upper Texas
Coast until after 1700. During the 18th and 19th centuries, however, the local
Indian populations declined due to disease, establishment of missions, and the
fur trade. Historic Indian groups known to inhabit the area were the Karankawa
on the coast and the Akokisa in inland areas on the Trinity River and in the area
of Galveston and Trinity bays (Swanton 1946). There are no known historic
Indian sites in Harris County.

METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, a background investigation was conducted. Site
records at TARL were checked for previously recorded sites in the project area
and vicinity. In addition, site reports documenting work in the region were
examined for information concerning archaeological surveys and other work
relevant to the project area, and Roger G. Moore was interviewed regarding his
previous work along Dinner Creek and western Harris County.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished using the pedestrian survey method
supported by shovel testing within the highway right-of-way. The proposed
construction will take place on the west side of Greenhouse Road, and it is this
area that was examined (Figure 5). Surface visibility was very poor due to a thick
cover of grass. The area was found to be very disturbed, and only four shovel
tests were excavated. The soil from the shovel tests was screened using ¼ inch
hardware cloth, and a shovel test log (Appendix I) was maintained. Four shovel
tests were excavated (Figure 3). In addition, the project was documented by field
notes and images taken with a digital camera. A hand-held GPS was used to
document survey locations.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
This field survey examined the entire three acres and found no evidence
of an archaeological site. The four shovel tests were dug to depths of 30 and 40
centimeters through disturbed soil. Soils in the project area consisted of clay
loam, sandy clay loam, and leached wet sand. The north side of the creek was
found to have been channelized, and one of the proposed storm drains had been
installed (Figure 6). The survey was performed in according with the Minimum
Survey Standards as published by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found within the APE. It is recommended
that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Should evidence of an
archaeological site be encountered during construction, all work in the area of the
find must cease until the THC can evaluate the situation. Also, if additional
construction not evaluated during this investigation is planned, the THC must be
notified as additional survey by a professional archaeologist may be warranted.
