MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 7 and 8 July 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey within extra work spaces associated with 5 pipe replacement
segments along the Longhorn pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in Hays and Blanco counties, Texas.
All of the 5 segments are located on private property with the exception of Segment 4, which is
located within Pedernales Falls State Park. Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey at
the request of Zephyr Environmental Corporation (Zephyr) on behalf of Magellan Pipeline
Company (Magellan). Although the Longhorn ROW is an existing, previously disturbed ROW,
cultural resources investigations on the ROW prior to future construction are required by a
Programmatic Agreement between Longhorn, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
and the US Department of Transportation (DOT). As such, the investigations along the ROW
on privately held lands were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, while the investigations along the ROW within
Pedernales Falls State Park were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA as
well as the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were present within the extra works spaces bordering the existing ROW and,
if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
and/or for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The investigations
within Pedernales Falls State Park were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
Permit No. 5975.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the extra work spaces within the 5 pipe
replacement segments along the existing Longhorn ROW resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the proposed extra work spaces or within
any of the 35 shovel tests excavated during the survey.
Based on the negative results of the survey, it is Horizon’s opinion that the use of the
extra work spaces during the replacement of the 5 segments (Segments 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4) of
the existing Longhorn Pipeline in the Pedernales River watershed will have no impact on
significant cultural resources, and that no further investigations are warranted. Horizon
therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of
the Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the ROW, even in previously surveyed

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of Extra Work Spaces Associated with 5 Pipe Replacement
Segments along the Longhorn Pipeline Right-of-Way in Hays and Blanco Counties, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey conducted
within extra work spaces associated with 5 pipe replacement segments along the Longhorn
pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in Hays and Blanco counties, Texas (Figures 1 though 8).
Magellan Pipeline Company (Magellan) is proposing to replace the 5 segments (Segments 1, 2,
3a, 3b, and 4) of the existing Longhorn Pipeline in the Pedernales River watershed in
accordance with a Settlement Agreement executed with the Lower Colorado River Authority
(LCRA) in 2001. All of the 5 segments are located on private property with the exception of
Segment 4, which is located within Pedernales Falls State Park. Although the pipeline
replacement will consist of removing segments of existing pipe and replacing them
approximately 8.0 feet north of the previous trench, but within the existing ROW, the
undertaking will require the clearing of additional work spaces immediately adjacent to the
existing ROW in order to facilitate staging areas for materials and equipment. These additional
work spaces will amount to approximately 10.0 feet of additional clearing on both sides of the
existing ROW. In all, the Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the extra work spaces totals
approximately 10.5 acres.
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources survey
at the request of Zephyr Environmental Corporation (Zephyr) on behalf of Magellan. Although
the Longhorn ROW is an existing, previously disturbed ROW, cultural resources investigations
on the ROW prior to future construction are required by a Programmatic Agreement between
Longhorn, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the US Department of
Transportation (DOT). As such, the investigations along the ROW on privately held lands were
conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended, while the investigations along the ROW within Pedernales Falls State Park
were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA as well as the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
present within the extra works spaces bordering the existing ROW and, if so, to determine their
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or for formal
designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The investigations within Pedernales
Falls State Park were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 5975.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of archival research, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the proposed extra work spaces bordering the 5 sections of the existing
Longhorn Pipeline ROW, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic

Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal Investigator for the
project. Jared Wiersema and Michael Mudd conducted the field investigations on 7 and 8 July
2011.
The 5 pipe replacement segments reported herein total 4.3 miles (7.0 kilometers [km]) in
length. Specifically, Segment 1 measures 1.6 miles (2.6 km) in length, Segment 2 measures
0.7 miles (1.1 km) in length, Segment 3a measures 0.1 miles (0.1 km) in length, Segment 3b
measures 0.3 miles (0.3 km) in length, and Segment 4 measures 1.8 miles (2.9 km) in length.
The extra work spaces bordering the existing ROW on these segments total 20.0 feet (15.3
meters [m]) in width (10.0 feet [3.0 m] on each side). Overall, the extra work spaces total 10.5
acres. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear projects measuring 100 feet in width. As the extra
work spaces measure only 20.0 feet (15.3 m) in width, a total of 14 shovel tests were necessary
to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 35 shovel
tests within the proposed extra work spaces. Seventeen of these shovel tests were conducted
within the proposed extra work spaces along Segment 4 within the boundaries of Pedernales
Falls State Park. Due to the fact that all proposed extra work spaces were located on upland
ridges of exposed limestone or granite bedrock characteristic of the Texas Hill Country, the
potential for buried deposits was minimal and all excavated shovel tests were extremely
shallow. However, this type of setting afforded excellent ground surface visibility within the
proposed extra work spaces, allowing for a thorough investigation of the areas assessed.
Moreover, even though the proposed extra work spaces total only 10.0 feet (3.0 m) on each
side of the existing pipeline ROW, the Horizon field crew assessed an area measuring 32.8 feet
(10.0 m) wide on each side of the existing ROW (65.6 feet [20.0 m] total width). This amounted
to an overall survey area of 34.4 acres.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the extra work spaces within the 5 pipe
replacement segments along the existing Longhorn ROW resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the proposed extra work spaces or within
any of the 35 shovel tests excavated during the survey.
Based on the negative results of the survey, it is Horizon’s opinion that the use of the
extra work spaces during the replacement of the 5 segments (Segments 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4) of
the existing Longhorn Pipeline in the Pedernales River watershed will have no impact on
significant cultural resources, and that no further investigations are warranted. Horizon
therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of
the Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the ROW, even in previously surveyed
areas, activities at the specific location of the find should cease and the THC should be notified
immediately of the discovery.

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The 5 proposed pipe replacement segments are located in northwestern Hays County
and northeastern Blanco County, Texas (see Figures 1 through 8). They can be found on the
US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Hammetts Crossing, Texas, Shingle Hills, Texas, and
Pedernales Falls, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps (see Figures 1 through 4). The total
APE consists of 10.0 feet (3.0 m) of extra work spaces on opposing sides (20.0 feet [6.1 m]
total) of approximately 22,828.0 feet (6958.0 m) of existing pipeline ROW. Of this, the 9514.4
feet (2900.00 m) comprising Segment 4 is located within the boundaries of Pedernales Falls
State Park. The remainder is located on privately held lands. Representative images of the
proposed extra work spaces at the time of the cultural resource survey are presented in
Figures 9 through 13.

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed extra work spaces are all located within rocky, undulating hills typical of
the Texas Hill Country in northwestern Hays County and northeastern Blanco County, Texas.
They are all located immediately north and south of the existing Longhorn Pipeline ROW.
Elevations within the extra work spaces range between 990.0 and 1200.0 feet (301.8 and 365.8
m) above mean sea level. Hydrologically, the extra work spaces are situated within the
Colorado River basin. They are drained primarily to the north by Flat Creek and tributaries of
the Pedernales River. Flat Creek joins the Pedernales River north of the extra work spaces,
while the Pedernales River eventually empties into the Colorado River a considerable distance
northeast of the extra work spaces.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1200 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar
transition found worldwide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.
Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
did the Paleo-Indian groups.

3.3

EARLY ARCHAIC (8000 TO 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
PaleoIndian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyonlands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late PaleoIndian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).

3.4

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (5000 TO 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different

18

050175 - 07 arch survey report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of Extra Work Spaces Associated with 5 Pipe Replacement
Segments along the Longhorn Pipeline Right-of-Way in Hays and Blanco Counties, Texas

subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.

3.5

LATE ARCHAIC (3000 TO 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at site 41WM815 dated between 2800
to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock middens on
the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in any other
period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a result of
the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes such as

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

sotol and yucca―foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens) in order
to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely resulted in
the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of buffalo.
Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an increase
in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile-making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.6

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. However, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that was
bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

3.7

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 400 BP TO PRESENT)

The Historic period, which began with the arrival of Europeans into the region, can be
divided into 3 subperiods: early, middle, and late. Only a brief overview of the period is given
here. For a more detailed essay, see Newcomb 1993:1-63.
The first documented arrival of Europeans into Central Texas dates to the early 18th
century (Newcomb 1993). Their influence, however, preceded their arrival. In the late 17th
century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began migrating into Central Texas
to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines, missions, and on Spanish
ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the Spanish had become an
integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison hunters of the High
Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They terrorized native
groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to flee, some into
Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region encountered native
groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the Apache, and the
diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their accounts, therefore, do
not provide direct analogs to prehistoric lifeway patterns, but rather represent a time of drastic
cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns may have prevailed through
time. Along with large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic
affiliations, small band-sized residential camps, both dating to this particular period, are found in
Central Texas (Collins 1995:386). These latter sites may represent indigenous groups.
The middle Historic subperiod began about 1730 and ended about 1800 as the mission
system was failing (Hester 1989; Collins 1995:386). Historic documents of this period make
reference to remnants of native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins
1995). Toward the end of this subperiod, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern
Texas from the high plains. Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be
highly biased since they are provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers
(Collins 1995).
The late Historic subperiod is composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung
nomadic native groups (primarily the Comanche),” and an archeological record of the European
presence (Collins 1995:387). The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th
century.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 5 previously recorded archeological sites within a
0.5-mile (0.8-km) perimeter of the proposed extra work spaces (THC 2011), while a review of
the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no
historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2011). The previously
recorded archeological sites and their distances from the proposed extra work spaces are
summarized in Table 2 below. No documented cultural resources, including any listed on the
NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the proposed extra work
spaces.

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the proposed extra
work spaces on elevated landforms above Flat Creek and tributaries of the Pedernales River, it
was Horizon’s original opinion that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits at select locations along the proposed extra work spaces.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to
the proposed extra work spaces on the relevant topographic quadrangles suggested a
decreased potential for historic-era standing structures within the proposed extra work spaces.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A 2-person archeological field crew conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the
proposed extra work spaces associated with the 5 pipe replacement segments on 7 and 8 July
2011. This entailed intensive surface inspection as well as subsurface shovel testing. The
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16
shovel tests per mile on linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the extra
work spaces measure only 20.0 feet (6.1 m) in width, a total of 14 shovel tests were necessary
to comply with the TSMASS along the 4.3 miles (7.0 km) that comprise the 5 pipe replacement
segments. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 35 shovel tests within the
proposed extra work spaces. Seventeen of these shovel tests were conducted within the
proposed extra work spaces along Segment 4 within the boundaries of Pedernales Falls State
Park. Due to the fact that all proposed extra work spaces were located on upland ridges of
exposed limestone or granite bedrock characteristic of the Texas Hill Country, the potential for
buried deposits was minimal and all excavated shovel tests were extremely shallow. However,
this type of setting afforded excellent ground surface visibility within the proposed extra work
spaces, allowing for a thorough investigation of the areas assessed. Moreover, even though the
proposed extra work spaces total only 10.0 feet (3.0 m) on each side of the existing pipeline
ROW, the Horizon field crew assessed an area measuring 32.8 feet (10.0 m) wide on each side
of the existing ROW (65.6 feet [20.0 m] total width). This amounted to an overall survey area of
34.4 acres.
During the field investigations, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils,
land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. If any new archeological sites
were encountered, standardized site forms were to be completed and submitted to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent housing. Similarly, “re-visit” forms
were to be completed for any previously recorded sites encountered during the investigations.
Standardized shovel test forms were completed for each excavated shovel test, and digital
photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. Location data were gathered
during the survey via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83
map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figures 14 through 17. As all shovel tests
were basically surficial or extremely shallow in nature, as well as all negative, the resulting
shovel test data have not been included in this document.
The survey utilized a selective-collection strategy. Any encountered non-diagnostic
artifacts (i.e. debitage, burned rock, etc.) were to be tabulated and assessed in the field.

HJN 050175 AR 07

25

Chapter 5.0: Methodology

Following this, all non-diagnostic artifacts were to be placed back where they were found. Any
temporally diagnostic artifacts (i.e., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s
marks, etc.) were to be collected for analysis and eventual curation in accordance with the
TARL Laboratory Manual. Any artifacts recovered within the boundaries of the state park were
to be curated within Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) collections. Additionally, all
records produced during the investigations (field notes, site forms, field maps, photographs with
photo log, and digital GIS data) were also to be prepared in accordance with the TARL Lab
Manual for curation within TPWD collections. As the survey resulted in negative results, the
collection strategy was not implemented.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

On 7 and 8 July 2001, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the
extra work spaces associated with 5 pipe replacement segments along the existing Longhorn
pipeline ROW in Hays and Blanco counties, Texas. All of the 5 segments are located on private
property with the exception of Segment 4, which is located within Pedernales Falls State Park.
Although the Longhorn ROW is an existing, previously disturbed ROW, cultural resources
investigations on the ROW prior to future construction are required by a Programmatic
Agreement between Longhorn, the EPA, and DOT. As such, the investigations along the ROW
on privately held lands were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as
amended, while the investigations along the ROW within Pedernales Falls State Park were
conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA as well as the ACT. The purpose of the
survey was to determine if any archeological sites were present within the extra works spaces
bordering the existing ROW and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP
and/or for formal designation as SALs. The investigations within Pedernales Falls State Park
were conducted under TAC Permit No. 5975.
The 5 pipe replacement segments reported herein total 4.3 miles (7.0 km) in length,
while the extra work spaces bordering the existing ROW on these segments total 20.0 feet (15.3
m) in width (10.0 feet [3.0 m] on each side). Overall, the extra work spaces total 10.5 acres.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear projects measuring 100
feet in width. As the extra work spaces measure only 20.0 feet (15.3 m) in width, a total of 14
shovel tests were necessary to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 35 shovel tests within the proposed extra work spaces. Seventeen of
these shovel tests were conducted within the proposed extra work spaces along Segment 4
within the boundaries of Pedernales Falls State Park. Due to the fact that all proposed extra
work spaces were located on upland ridges of exposed limestone or granite bedrock
characteristic of the Texas Hill Country, the potential for buried deposits was minimal and all
excavated shovel tests were extremely shallow. However, this type of setting afforded excellent
ground surface visibility within the proposed extra work spaces, allowing for a thorough
investigation of the areas assessed. Moreover, even though the proposed extra work spaces
total only 10.0 feet (3.0 m) on each side of the existing pipeline ROW, the Horizon field crew
assessed an area measuring 32.8 feet (10.0 m) wide on each side of the existing ROW (65.6
feet [20.0 m] total width). This amounted to an overall survey area of 34.4 acres.

Chapter 6.0: Results and Recommendations

The intensive cultural resources survey of the extra work spaces within the 5 pipe
replacement segments along the existing Longhorn ROW resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the proposed extra work spaces or within
any of the 35 shovel tests excavated during the survey.

6.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the survey, it is Horizon’s opinion that the use of the
extra work spaces during the replacement of the 5 segments (Segments 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4) of
the existing Longhorn Pipeline in the Pedernales River watershed will have no impact on
significant cultural resources, and that no further investigations are warranted. Horizon
therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of
the Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the ROW, even in previously surveyed
areas, activities at the specific location of the find should cease and the THC should be notified
immediately of the discovery.
