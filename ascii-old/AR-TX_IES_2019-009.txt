ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
for the Mustang Business Park project located within the Dallas Fort Worth International
Airport (DFW) property in Tarrant County, Texas. The proposed project pertains to the
development of approximately 61.25 acres located along Mustang Drive, east of State
Highway (SH) 114 and SH 121. Approval from the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) will be required to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP) to reflect the permanent
alterations on the DFW property. Since the ALP is considered a federal action, the
project will require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Additionally, as the DFW is a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources that could
be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for
their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources inventory survey was conducted on 07 February 2019. All work
conformed to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26, which outlines the regulations for
implementing the ACT, and was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8744. During
the survey, two newly recorded historic-age archeological sites (41TR317 and 41TR318)
were documented within the APE. Based on the lack of association with historically
important individuals or events, absence of significant architectural features, the degree
of prior disturbance, and lack of contextual integrity, sites 41TR317 and 41TR318 are
recommended to be not eligible for listing in the NRHP or designation as SALs.
No artifacts were collected during this survey. All records will be permanently curated at
the Center for Archeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio. No
additional cultural resources evaluation or mitigation is recommended. However, if any
cultural resources, other than those discussed in this report, are encountered during
construction, the operators should stop construction activities in the vicinity of the
inadvertent discovery, and immediately contact the project cultural resources
representative to initiate coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior
to resuming construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under contract to the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). A
description of the proposed project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE), environmental and historical
contexts, field and analytical methods, results of the investigations, and recommendations regarding the
identified cultural resources are provided in this document. Prepared in accordance with the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines, this report satisfies the requirements of Section 106 of
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) for the proposed
project.

1.1 Introduction
As the project cultural resources consultant for the DFW, IES performed an intensive cultural resources
survey for the Mustang Business Park Project. The proposed project pertains to the development of a
portion of the DFW property in Tarrant County, Texas (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). Approval will be required
from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP) that will
reflect the permanent alterations to the DFW property. Since this is considered a federal action, the
project will consequently require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
Section 106 of the NHPA. In addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the
project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
This report documents the cultural resources survey conducted in support of the proposed project. The
purpose of these investigations was to conduct an inventory of cultural resources (as defined by Code of
Federal Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed APE and to
evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the NHPA of 1966, as amended, or for designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the ACT (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191 [9
TNRC 191]) and associated state regulations (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC
26]). All investigations were conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26, which outline
the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. This survey was
conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8744.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Direct APE
The direct APE for the project encompasses approximately 61.25 acres (ac) and is located at the
southwest corner of the intersection of West 17th Street and Mustang Drive. Although final project
designs for the APE are not available at this time, preliminary plans call for the construction of a
multi-building industrial and mixed-use commercial development. Ground disturbances associated with
this development will include tree removal, general land clearing, surface grading, erosion control, and
utility and transportation development. Depths of impacts associated with the proposed project will
generally be within several feet of the current ground surface, with the exception of specific project
components such as the installation of water and sanitary sewer infrastructure that may exceed depths of
10 feet (ft). However, field investigations will assess to the depth of soils capable of containing
archeological deposits.

Indirect APE
As the project will require approval from the FAA, an assessment of indirect effects is required to comply
with the NHPA. For this project, it is anticipated that the sole indirect effect of the undertaking will be
related to the visual effects of above-ground project elements, associated with the proposed construction
of industrial or mixed-use commercial buildings, on historic-age (i.e., at least 50 years old) buildings and
structures in the vicinity. To account for these above-ground elements, the indirect effects assessment
area will encompass a 300-ft buffer surrounding the APE.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Tarrant County is located in the north central portion of the State of Texas. This region has a humid
subtropical climate and an average annual precipitation ranging from approximately 35 to 40 inches (in;
89 to 102 centimeters [cm]). About half of the precipitation usually falls as rain between April and May,
with July and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a
relatively mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and
Earl 2008).
Topography, Geology, and Soil
Overall, the majority of the DFW is located within a gently rolling upland setting that is irregularly
dissected by the headwaters of unnamed tributaries of surrounding streams. The periphery of the DFW
property contains more dramatic topography with incised drainages and named waterways, particularly
along the western, southern, and eastern limits. The transition of the gently sloping upland ridges to the
low-lying Big Bear Creek valley floor correlates to a transition from the more stable, clay-rich Blackland
Prairie soils to the more erosive, sandy soils of the Cross Timbers ecological region. The Mustang
Business Park APE is located on the southern flank of an interfluvial upland ridge dissected by an
unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek (see Figure 1.2). Elevations within the APE range from 601 to 637
ft (183 to 194 meters [m]) above modern sea level (amsl) with slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.
The DFW property is located within an environmental interface, known as an ecotone, between the
Northern Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers ecoregions (McGowen et al. 1987). Variation
among each ecoregion is a direct result of the underlying regional geology (Diggs et al. 1999). The
natural divide between these two ecoregions is east of Big Bear Creek, which extends from the northwest
to the southeast through the western portion of the DFW property.
The Northern Blackland Prairie is distinguished from surrounding regions by gently rolling hills and
fine-textured, black, clay-rich soils that primarily support prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2007).
Vertisols dominate the Blackland Prairie ecoregion and consist of high clay content soils with significant
shrink and swell potential (Ressel 1981). Historical vegetation included little bluestem, big bluestem,
yellow Indiangrass, and tall dropseed. Most of the native prairie has been converted to cropland, nonnative pasture, and expanding urban uses around Dallas, Waco, Austin, and San Antonio.
The Eastern Cross Timbers region was historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills
that are orientated along a north-to-south axis from Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring
1994; McGowan et al. 1987). This region contains numerous hills that were once heavily wooded with
oak, walnut, and hickory trees supported by deep sandy soils (Hill 1901). Early pioneers referred to the
region as the Monte Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. However, due to urban
expansion, agricultural development, and other modern activities, the natural vegetation has become
highly fragmented, and only a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remain today (TPWD 2019).
The APE is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Woodbine (Kwb) and Eagle Ford (Kef) geological
formations (Figure 2.1). The Woodbine Formation is primarily sandstone and contains a small
percentage of siltstone, mudstone, and clay (McGowen et al. 1987, USGS 2019). Weathering of the
Woodbine Formation has resulted in the formation of soils with a sandy epipedon within the Cross
Timbers ecoregion. The Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) is comprised of shale, sandstone, and limestone
dating to the Cretaceous (McGowen et al. 1987; Scoggins 2004) and weathering of the formation results
in the dark, vertic soils of the Blackland Prairie.

There are five mapped soil units within the APE (Figure 2.2; Table 2.1, Ressel 1981). The entire APE
contains soils typical of in situ soil development in upland settings within the Eastern Cross Timbers and
Northern Blackland Prairie regions. Soil data was viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Web Soil Survey 2019).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas
(THSA) electronic databases, maintained by the THC, identified no previously recorded archeological
sites, National Register properties or districts, historical markers, or cemeteries located within the
proposed APE (TASA 2019; THSA 2019). The TASA database depicted two previously conducted
archeological surveys within the APE (Table 3.1; Figure 3.1). The TASA records further indicated that
an additional eight archeological surveys have been conducted within 1 mile (mi) of the APE (Table 3.2).
As a result of these previous surveys, five archeological sites have been documented within 1 mi of the
APE (Table 3.3).

3.2 Cultural Resources Potential
In 2007 and 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted intensive pedestrian surveys of 1,210 ac on the
DFW property under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4491 and published their results in the report An
Archaeological Survey for Chesapeake Energy Corporation at DFW International Airport Dallas and
Tarrant Counties, Texas (Shelton et al. 2008). Through this study, three environmental zones were
identified within the airport that contain varying probabilities for the presence of cultural resources.
The current APE extends across the Blackland Prairie Uplands (Zone 1) and Eastern Cross Timbers (Zone
2; Figure 3.2). Approximately 20 percent of the APE is situated within Zone 1. This zone primarily
consists of level or gently undulating landforms mantled by clay or clay loam soils over limestone
bedrock. Water permeates very slowly to the water table causing slow surface runoff and high shrink and
swell potential. This setting has a low biotic diversity and is dominated by short grasses. Due to the
limited resources available within the area, it has a low probability for containing prehistoric
archeological sites (Shelton et al. 2008).
The remaining approximate 80 percent of the APE is within the Eastern Cross Timbers (Zone 2). Zone 2
is typified by a wide array of well-drained soil types ranging from those with high clay content to sandy
loams located on uplands, ridges, terraces, tributary streams, and valleys. Accordingly, these soils
supported a wide range of vegetation and dense stands of old growth trees during the prehistoric period.
These upland soils are moderately well suited for cropland, pastureland, or urban development and the
area has been well utilized for agricultural purposes since early historic settlement. As such, Zone 2 is
considered to have a high potential for containing both prehistoric and historic-age archeological sites
(Shelton et al. 2008).
Direct APE
Prehistoric Resource Potential
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for
Tarrant County indicates that most of the APE contains a low to moderate potential for containing cultural
resources within both shallow subsurface and deeply buried contexts. However, background review
indicates that nearly half of the APE has been subjected to previous ground disturbing activities. As such,
previously disturbed portions of the APE do not retain contextual integrity and the archeological potential
of these areas is reduced to low. Furthermore, the APE is located across a dissected upland escarpment
landform in the headwaters of an unnamed tributary of Bear Creek with no alluvial soil deposition.
Therefore, the presence of deeply buried (i.e., greater than depths of 3 ft) archeological deposits are
unlikely to occur within the APE. For the purposes of this survey, previously undisturbed portions of the
APE are considered to have a low to moderate potential for containing surface or near surface prehistoric
archeological deposits.
Historic Period Resource Potential
During background review, the former locations of multiple buildings were identified within the APE on
historical aerial photographs and maps. The 1895 Sam Street’s Map of Tarrant County illustrates that
homes owned by J. H. Willis and Ed Andrews were located along a wagon road in the northern and
southern portions of the APE, respectively. In addition, a dwelling occupied by an unnamed renter is
indicated to have been present in the east-central portion of the APE on the 1895 map. The 1924 USDA
Tarrant County soil map and the 1931 USGS Grapevine 15-minute topographic map also depict buildings
at the locations of the Willis and Andrews homes. The 1936 Texas State Highway Department map of
Tarrant County indicates that two buildings were located within or near the APE. A 1942 aerial
photograph depicts the two farmsteads adjacent to a rural road extending north then northwest through the
central portion the APE. These farmsteads are at the same locations as the J. H. Willis and Ed Andrews
homes illustrated on the 1895 Sam Street’s map. By the 1940s, each farmstead contained several

associated buildings, including barns and outbuildings. By 1957, multiple buildings as part of a
farmstead were constructed south of a secondary road that extended to the western corner of the APE.
Between 1957 and 1963, all buildings associated with the northernmost Willis farmstead were
demolished. After properties were purchased for DFW in the late 1960s and early 1970s, most of the
standing structures within the APE were demolished between 1970 and 1979.
Indirect APE Resource Potential
Based on a review of historic maps and aerial photographs, no historic-age standing structures or
architectural resources are present within the indirect APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODS
The methods utilized during this survey satisfy the archeological survey standards for field investigations
recommended by the CTA (CTA 1996, 2001), as approved by the THC. Components of the survey
included archival and background research, pedestrian reconnaissance survey, intensive survey,
archeological site recording, and NRHP/SAL evaluation of each documented resource. Prior to
fieldwork, the IES staff conducted historical and archeological records reviews to determine the locations
of previously recorded resources within the APE and within a 1-mi (1.6-kilometer [km]) radius of the
direct APE (see Section 3.1). IES staff also reviewed ecological, geologic, and soils data, historical and
modern topographic maps, and aerial photographs of the APE. Due to the variability in prehistoric and
historic-period settlement patterns, land use, and archeological site preservation within the APE, multiple
survey and sampling methods were used during this investigation, including the use of systematic shovel
testing to locate and define archeological sites.

4.1 Survey Methods
Pedestrian Survey
This cultural resources survey consisted of a pedestrian survey augmented by the excavation of
systematically-placed shovel tests. The pedestrian reconnaissance survey consisted of visual examination
of the ground surface and existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the
APE. The pedestrian survey consisted of a multiple transect scheme, which was implemented across the
APE with a focus on areas determined during the background review to contain a high probability for the
occurrence of cultural resources. Transects were spaced in 30-meter (m) intervals orientated in a general
northeast-to-southwest orientation. Areas displaying high levels of disturbance were photographed to
document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods included
narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.
Intensive Survey
In previously unsurveyed and undisturbed portions of the APE with the potential for preserving
archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to the top of culturally sterile deposits, typically to
the argillic (Bt) or calcic (Bk) subsoil horizon. Shovel tests were at least 30 cm in diameter and were
hand-excavated in levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using 0.25-in
hardware cloth to facilitate the recovery of buried cultural materials. When high clay content soils were
encountered and could not be efficiently screened, material was manually troweled and inspected for
cultural deposits. The physical properties of each natural soil stratum were recorded and investigators
documented the results of each test on standardized shovel test forms. All shovel test locations were
recorded and plotted using Garmin or Trimble GeoXT handheld global positioning system (GPS) units.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in imperial units (e.g., in, ft,
mi) within this report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric units (e.g., cm,
m, km), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are more appropriately recorded in
imperial units.
Archival Research
Historical maps and aerial photographs encompassing the direct APE and indirect APE were reviewed to
determine the locations of historic-age (e.g., greater than 50 years old) structures. Deed/title research was
conducted for archeological sites that contained evidence of historic-period site components and historicperiod architectural resources. The purpose was to identify historically notable persons that were possibly
associated with any resource documented during this survey. Initial research was carried out by
examining deed and land title records from the Tarrant County Clerk’s Office (TCCO). The historic

significance of identified persons associated with each resource were also researched using The
Handbook of Texas Online database, online genealogy websites, and within various local history
publications.
Site Recording
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural resources.
The recognition of a “site” is therefore contingent on content and extent. Content may refer to artifacts or
cultural features encountered in surface or subsurface contexts, architectural elements, or other
manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the vertical and horizontal spatial
arrangement of these cultural remains. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five or more artifacts of
at least two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 400
square meter [m2; 0.1-ac] area) or at least one cultural feature. The extent of the surface artifacts and
cultural features are then defined as the site boundary. When artifacts or features are encountered in
buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive excavations. In cases where
an excavated survey sampling location (i.e., shovel test) yields cultural materials, additional delineation
excavations are conducted to define the boundary of the site. The spatial extent of the site is defined
within the extent of positive excavations and surface artifacts or features when both are present. In
addition, archival research can also be used to define the limits of some historic-period archeological
sites.
Cultural remains, meeting these criteria, are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site
Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) to be included in the
TASA database. Conversely, discovery of cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are considered
isolated occurrences of past human activity and are simply documented by location and content. Modern
materials and features (i.e., less than 50 years old) are not considered sites, with only location and content
noted during the survey. Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can
be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as SALs. Cultural isolates and modern features
are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as SALs because of their failure to meet the
site definition and their inability to contribute important information to the understanding of history or
prehistory.

4.2 Site Evaluation
Each identified archeological site was plotted on the appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map and a
scaled site map was prepared for each site. Field data were processed to evaluate site significance and
potential eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and designation as a SAL. When applicable, a variety of
data were used to assess site significance including temporal period, artifact density, artifact variety,
feature density, feature variety, feature preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and the amount of previous
disturbance.
National Register Evaluation Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resource is based on federal guidelines and regulations. The
criteria for evaluating resources for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of the NHPA,
as amended (36 CFR 60.4 [a–d]), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth
guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Federal regulations indicate that “[t]he term ‘eligible for
inclusion in the National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary
of the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR 800.2[e]).
Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any cultural resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP is a historic property.
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria
for eligibility are applied. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,

integrity of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
Criterion A:
Criterion B:
Criterion C:

Criterion D:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history [36 CFR 60.4(a–d)].

The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to
one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and
chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential
for cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal
period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural
resources is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D
is generally associated with prehistoric, but also historic-era, archeological sites. Criteria A, B, and C
typically reflect association with historic-era resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the
current project was to locate and define both the horizontal and vertical extents of any cultural resources,
document and describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for
NRHP eligibility.
State Antiquities Landmark Evaluation Criteria
For purposes of implementing the ACT, the THC is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting
and preserving SALs (9 Texas Natural Resources Code [TNRC] 191). A SAL is an archeological site,
archeological collection, ruin, building, structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering feature, monument
or other object, or district that is eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already officially designated
as a landmark. The State of Texas considers all publicly-owned archeological sites and historic buildings
and structures to have some intrinsic historic value, and the ACT provides some level of protection for
those sites, buildings, or structures regardless of their size, character, or ability to currently yield data that
will contribute important information on the history or prehistory of Texas. Additionally, these publiclyowned archeological sites and historic buildings and structures are protected from vandalism, or other
actions meant to take, alter, or destroy them, and information directly related to the specific location of
archeological sites is restricted from open records requests. However, not all cultural resources are
equally significant to the history and prehistory of Texas. Some archeological sites may not possess
research value sufficient to warrant long-term preservation or investigations beyond survey level
documentation, and some historic buildings and structures retain minimal integrity due to damage or
deterioration. Therefore, the issue of whether cultural resources are significant and warrant preservation,
and/or further research (such as archeological testing and data recovery level investigations), is addressed
through official landmark designation, permit issuance, and rules associated with enforcement of the
ACT. Archeological sites and historic buildings and structures on lands belonging to state agencies or
political subdivisions of the state of Texas are eligible to be designated as landmarks (9 TNRC 191.091
and 191.092). Also protected, under 9 TNRC 191.094, are specially designated landmarks on private
property.
Under the ACT at the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as a SAL. The THC uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the
appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the ACT
permit process:

Criterion 1:
Criterion 2:
Criterion 3:
Criterion 4:
Criterion 5:

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively,
further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting
when the site cannot be protected (13 TAC 26.10).

4.3 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Artifacts encountered during fieldwork were identified,
inventoried, and returned to the context from which they were recovered. Representative samples and
temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts were photographed. Records, correspondence, field notes,
forms, and other documentation will be included in the curation package. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to CAR curation standards and submitted for
curation. All field-generated documents will be temporarily stored at the IES office and permanently
curated at UTSA CAR.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During this survey, the direct APE was subjected to reconnaissance survey transects and a systematic
intensive survey. Pedestrian reconnaissance survey was conducted across the entire APE to determine the
extent of prior ground disturbances and assess the likelihood of encountering cultural resources. Ground
surface visibility was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 0 percent in undisturbed
areas and heavily wooded areas to 100 percent in areas of recent vegetation removal. Intensive survey
with systematic shovel test sampling was also conducted within previously undisturbed portions of the
APE during this survey. As a result, two historic-period archeological sites (41TR317 and 41TR318)
were documented within the direct APE. No cultural resources were encountered within the indirect
APE.

5.1 Archeological Survey
During this survey, 40 shovel tests were excavated within the 61.25 ac APE (Figure 5.1). Shovel test
sampling was conducted within portions of the APE with the potential to contain buried archeological
deposits. These portions of the APE generally featured sparse wooded growth with minimal undergrowth
(Appendix A, Photographs 1 through 5). The northern portion of the APE consisted of thin wooded
growth with dense grass groundcover and open fields (Appendix A, Photograph 6 through 8). The
remaining portions of the APE were determined to have been significantly disturbed by construction
activities during the late 20th century and contained a negligible potential for subsurface cultural deposits.
Recent localized grubbing was conducted within the northern and southern portions of the APE
(Attachment A, Photographs 9 and 13). When shovel test sampling was proposed within these sections,
the individual shovel tests were offset to maximize the potential for sampling within less disturbed areas.
Subsequently, more extensively disturbed areas were visually assessed and photographed during the
pedestrian survey.
Soils exposed within shovel tests across the APE revealed a profile that transitioned from very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) to depths of approximately 30 cmbs. Soil
textures were generally characterized as sandy loam or sandy clay loam. Few subsurface inclusions were
observed throughout the APE. Below the upper stratum, soils ranged from a brown (7.5YR 4/3 and 4/4)
to a compact, dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay loam argillic (Bt) subsoil horizon. The maximum depth of the
shovel tests was approximately 55 cmbs with most terminating between 30 to 40 cmbs due to
encountering the culturally sterile Bt subsoil horizon. In addition to shovel testing, subsurface exposures
including animal burrows, disturbed patches, and the exposed cut banks of an unnamed tributary of Big
Bear Creek were examined (Appendix A, Photographs 14 through 15).
Archeologists observed large piles of vegetation and several small scatters of modern trash (plastic and
metal containers, tires, etc.) within the APE. In addition, four historic-age features, including structural
foundations, a well, a wire animal pen, and a sparse historic-period surface artifact scatter were observed
within the APE. These were verified on historic-period aerial photographs as two distinct early-to-mid20th century farmsteads (Figures 5.2 and 5.3). As a result of this survey, sites 41TR317 and 41TR318
were documented and defined within the extent of historic-age features and historic-period property
parcel boundaries.

5.2 Encountered Resources
Site 41TR317
During the IES survey, newly documented historical-period site 41TR317 was encountered within the
northern portion of the APE approximately 0.27 mi southwest of the intersection of South Main Street
and Mustang Drive (Figure 5.4). The site was located on a gently sloping interfluvial upland landform
bordering the unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek. The site was within a sparsely wooded field with
visible signs of recent vegetation grubbing (Appendix B, Photograph 1 through 3). Site 41TR317 was
documented within an area extending approximately 20 m north-to-south by 15 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.016 hectare (ha; 0.04 ac). The site was delineated based on the presence
of archeological features, distribution surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and observed surface
disturbances. The site was entirely within the APE.
Survey Observations
Ground surface visibility during the survey was approximately 25 percent in undisturbed portions of the
site to 100 percent where recent vegetation clearing had occurred. Vegetation within and surrounding the
site included short grasses, small woody shrubs, and post oak trees. Investigators observed a low density
artifact scatter that included colorless window glass, bottle glass (colorless, amber, green, and aqua), brick
fragments, rusted scrap metal, appliances, flagstones, tin and steel cans, and automotive tires (Appendix
B, Photographs 4 through 7). Glass manufacturers represented at site 41TR317 included the OwensIllinois Glass Company (1929 to present; bottle produced in 1970), Alexander H. Kerr and Company
(“AHK;” 1969 to 1996; Lockhart et al. 2016), and a Dr. Pepper bottle (manufactured post-1971 based on
the design; Lockhart 2010).
During the delineation of site 41TR317, IES investigators excavated six shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site consisted of an upper stratum that transitioned from dark
brown (10YR 3/2) to brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam to a depth of approximately 30 to 50 cmbs with
few gravel inclusions. Beneath this stratum, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) gravelly clay Bt subsoil
horizon was encountered. No artifacts were encountered within shovel tests.
Features
Feature 1 was a brick-lined well measuring approximately 75 cm in diameter that was enclosed within a
concrete well house (Appendix B, Photographs 8 and 9). The well feature was located on slightly
sloped terrain approximately 25 m north of the cleared stock yard. The well collar was disarticulated and
featured machine-made bricks that were once set in mortar. The well walls featured machine-made bricks
set in mortar. The well featured a rectangular poured concrete enclosure or well house measuring 1 m by
1 m by 1 m.
A 2-m-by-2-m depression was observed approximately 7 m southwest of the well (Appendix B,
Photograph 10). The walls of the depression were relatively fresh and exhibited few signs of prolonged
erosion or weathering. Large 10-cm-by-10-cm flagstones were observed near the surface of the
depression wall and loose on the depression floor. Historical-period aerial imagery dating to 1942 depicts
the general location of the depression near the back of what appears to be the primary domestic dwelling
associated with the farmstead. Based on the presence of flagstones, its general location, and its
rectangular form, the depression likely pertained to a stone-lined root cellar that has recently been
removed.

Archival Research
Site 41TR317 is located within the Jonathan B. Fay survey (Abstract No. 530), which was patented on
07 December 1854. According to the Tarrant County tax cards, an 80-acre property (Tract 4 of the Fay
Survey) owned by the Willis family had a stone foundation cottage dating to 1874 and another cottage
built in 1900. The farmstead also contained two sheds constructed in 1905 and a barn with a concrete
foundation dating to 1928. The Sam Street’s Map of Tarrant County in 1895 depicts a house owned by
J. N. Willis located at this location.
Using public deed records from the Tarrant County Clerk’s Office, a chain-of-title for the property
encompassing the site was generated (Table 5.1). According to deed records, the property on which the
site is located was primarily associated with the Willis and Spinks families. No additional information
regarding any of the names within the chain-of-title was found in the Handbook of Texas, local histories,
or online genealogical research resources for Tarrant County.

Site Summary
Site 41TR317 occupied in an area approximately 20 m north-to-south by 15 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.016 ha (0.04 ac) within the APE. The site is entirely within the APE. Six
shovel tests were excavated during intensive survey and site delineation, none of which yielded cultural
materials. One archeological feature and a low density surface scatter of domestic debris were observed.
Site 41TR317 represents a well servicing a historic-period farmstead occupied during the late 19th or early
20th centuries.
Site 41TR318
During the IES survey, newly documented historical-period site 41TR318 was encountered along the
western boundary of the APE approximately 320 m south by southeast on the intersection of Stone Myers
Parkway and Mustang Drive (Figure 5.5). The site was located on the margins of a gently sloping
interfluvial upland landform bordering the unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek. The site was within a
sparsely-wooded field with moderate undergrowth. Site 41TR318 was documented within an area
extending approximately 140 m north-to-south by 40 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.34
ha (0.85 ac). The site was delineated based on the distribution of archeological features, surface artifacts,
negative shovel tests, and the extent of the APE. The site likely extends to the north outside this portion
of the APE.
Survey Observations
Ground surface visibility during the survey was poor across the site due to leaf litter and other organic
coverage. Vegetation within and surrounding the site included various oak trees and sparse undergrowth.
Investigators observed minimal surface artifacts that included domestic-related scrap metal, brick and

brick fragments, discarded appliances, colorless window glass, steel pipes, teal- and yellow-glazed
ceramic floor and kitchen countertop tile, and a 1963 Ford Falcon automobile. No subsurface artifacts or
features were encountered within the site.
During the delineation of site 41TR318, IES investigators excavated 15 shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel test sampling within the site consisted of an upper stratum that transition from very
dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam with few rootlets and
gravel inclusions. This was underlaid by a stratum of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay Bt subsoil
horizon with no inclusions. No subsurface artifacts were encountered during shovel test sampling.
Features
Feature 1 was a raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 11 m by 12 m (Appendix C,
Photographs 01 through 19). The foundation was raised approximately 6 cm above the ground surface
along the eastern boundary and approximately 30 cm along the western boundary. The foundation
featured two attached concrete slab patios along the western and northern boundary. The western slab
measured approximately 4 m by 1.3 m, and the northern slab measured approximately 1.4 m by 3 m. A
wooden patio was observed along the eastern boundary. This patio measured approximately 6 m by
1.3 m and was in a state of deterioration with numerous rotted boards at the time of field survey. A high
density scatter of domestic debris was observed within the foundation, which included colorless bottle
glass manufactured by the Ball Corporation. The western portion of Feature 1 contained a partially
articulated, but collapsed chimney constructed utilizing Ferris-stamped bricks (1910 to 1923; Steinbomer
1982; Appendix C, Photograph 19). An additional “RELIANCE”-stamped brick was observed within
Feature 1, which was manufactured by the Reliance Brick Company in operation from 1923 to present. A
1963 Ford Falcon was observed approximately 20 m north of Feature 1. Historical aerial imagery
indicates Feature 1 was constructed between 1953 and 1968 and served as the primary domestic dwelling
of the farmstead.
Feature 2 was a collapsed shed measuring approximately 3 m by 3 m (Appendix C, Photograph 20).
The shed was manufactured using milled wood framing and corrugated steel siding and roofing. A single
corner beam was standing at the time of field survey.
Feature 3 was a roughly-hewn post and wire fenced enclosure measuring approximately 6 m by 17 m
(Appendix C, Photograph 21 through 26). Within the enclosure few scrap metal fragments and
corrugated steel siding fragments were observed. Based on their configuration, Features 2 and 3
pertained to an animal pen and associated storage area servicing the farmstead centered around Feature 1.
Archival Research
Site 41TR318 is located within Tract 4A of the Jonathan B. Fay survey. Using public deed records from
the Tarrant County Clerk’s Office, a chain-of-title for the property encompassing the site was generated
(Table 5.2). According to deed records, the property on which the site is located was primarily associated
with the Stone family. No additional information regarding any of the names within the chain-of-title was
found in the Handbook of Texas, local histories, or online genealogical research resources for Tarrant
County.

Not Eligible

41TR318

Not Eligible within the APE

41TR317 represents a well servicing a historic-period farmstead occupied during the late 19th or early 20th
centuries. During the site investigation, one archeological feature and a sparse surface scatter of
colorless window glass, bottle glass, brick fragments, rusted scrap metal, appliances, flagstones, steel
cans, and automotive tires were observed. The site was located entirely within the APE. The site
does not retain sufficient data to contribute important information regarding community development
in Tarrant County or the greater region during the late 19th or early 20th centuries. As such, site
41TR317 is considered to have little research potential and is not likely to yield any additional
information relevant to understanding the historic period within the region. Due to the lack of
association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s), the lack of important architectural
features, and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, site 41TR317 does not meet
NRHP significance standards under Criteria A, B, C, or D. Thus, it is recommended that site
41TR317 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4.
Subsequently, the site is not eligible for SAL designation.
41TR318 represents a historic-period farmstead occupied during the early to mid-20th century. During
the site investigation, three archeological features and a sparse surface scatter of brick and brick
fragments, discarded appliances, colorless window glass, metal piping, ceramic tiles, and an
abandoned automobile were observed. The site was located partially within the APE and likely
extends outside the APE to the north. The site does not retain sufficient data to contribute important
information regarding community development in Tarrant County or the greater region during the
early to mid-20th century. As such, the portion of site 41TR318 within the APE is considered to have
little research potential and is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding
the historic period within the region. Due to the lack of association with a significant historical
event(s) or person(s), the lack of important architectural features, and the low potential to yield
significant archeological data, the portion of site 41TR318 within the APE does not meet NRHP
significance standards under Criteria A, B, C, or D. Thus, it is recommended that the portion of site
41TR318 within the APE is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in
36 CFR 60.4. Subsequently, the portion of site 41TR318 within the APE is not eligible for SAL
designation.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the Mustang Business Park project be permitted to
continue without the need for further cultural resources investigations. However, if any cultural
resources, other than those detailed within this report, are encountered during construction, the operators
should immediately stop construction activities in those areas. The project cultural resources consultant
should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC prior to resuming construction
activities in the area of the inadvertent discovery. In addition, if project designs change, and areas outside
the APE detailed within this report are to be impacted, additional field investigations may be required.
