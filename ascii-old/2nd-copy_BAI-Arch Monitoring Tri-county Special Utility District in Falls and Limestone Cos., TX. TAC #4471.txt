ABSTRACT
In April and July 2007, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates) at the
request of Duff Consulting Engineers, Inc. and on behalf of the Tri-County Special Utility District
(TCSUD), monitored the excavation of approximately 1,200 feet of backhoe trench excavations during
the construction of water lines at one location in Falls County, Texas and a second area in Limestone
County, Texas. Investigations discovered no archeological deposits within the monitoring areas and no
artifacts were collected. Curation was unnecessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Monitoring for the Tri-County Special Utility District, Falls and
Limestone Counties, Texas
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and archeological
monitoring of 1,200 feet of water line trench excavations at two locations within the Tri-County Special
Utility District (TCSUD) project area in Falls and Limestone counties, Texas. Because of wet, saturated
conditions during field investigations that prohibited backhoe trenching, archeological monitoring was
recommended at these two locations by Blanton & Associates following their 2000 (Brown et al.)
intensive archeological survey of 24.2 miles of TCSUD’s proposed water line improvements in Falls,
McClennan, Robertson, and Limestone counties, Texas.
Archeological monitoring in Limestone County occurred along 600 feet of water line trench in the Kosse
3 Segment of the TCSUD project area. This location is immediately adjacent to the east side of FM 339 at
an unnamed tributary of Rocky Creek near the community of Odds, Texas. The second monitoring area
was along FM 2958 at Big Sandy Creek in the Marlin 4 Segment of the TCSUD project area.
PROJECT LOCATION: The monitoring areas are located in central Falls County (Marlin 4 Segment)
and southwest Limestone County (Kosse 3 Segment), Texas. The Kosse 3 monitoring area is located on
the Odds, Texas, USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle and the Marlin 4 monitoring area is located
on the McClanahan, Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 0.42 acres.
DATE OF WORK: 23 April 2007 and 2 August 2007
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(and subsequent amendments).
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4471
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Archeological monitoring in the Kosse 3 and Marlin 4 Segments of the TCSUD project
area discovered no archeological deposits, only wet, dense, and sticky alluvial clays. Thus, waterline
construction in the monitoring areas had no effects on any archeological historic properties eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places or sites eligible for formal State Archeological Landmark
designation. Given these conditions, Blanton & Associates recommends to the Texas Historical
Commission that TCSUD has fulfilled its Section 106 and Antiquities Code of Texas obligations and, as
such, the project should be granted archeological clearance without the need for additional investigations.

INTRODUCTION
In April and July 2007, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates), at the
request of Duff Consulting Engineers, Inc. and on behalf of the Tri-County Special Utility District
(TCSUD), monitored the excavation of approximately 1,200 feet of backhoe trench excavations during
the construction of water lines at two locations in Falls and Limestone Counties, Texas (Figure 1).
Archeological monitoring was recommended in 2000 following Blanton & Associates’ intensive
archeological survey of 24.2 miles of existing and proposed TCSUD water lines in Falls, McClennan,
Robertson, and Limestone counties, Texas (Brown et al. 2001). Supersaturated conditions at the tributary
of Rocky Creek and at Big Sandy Creek prohibited backhoe trenching at these locations during the
original investigation (Brown et al. 2001).
Monitoring efforts in Limestone County occurred along 600 feet of water line trench immediately east of
FM 339 at an unnamed tributary of Rocky Creek near the community of Odds, Texas. A second 600-foot
long monitoring area was adjacent to the north side of FM 2958 at Big Sandy Creek roughly three miles
east-southeast of Marlin, Texas in Falls County. Both sections of water line occupy a 15-foot wide water
line easement on private property immediately adjacent to the highways. The Area of Potential Effect
(APE) for each monitoring area was 600 feet long, 15 feet wide, approximately 0.21 acre in size, and
extended to a maximum depth of 36 inches below ground surface.
Waterline construction occurred on property owned by a subdivision of the State of Texas, in this case
TCSUD, the project is therefore subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now
subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary
conditions for recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that
any state agency or other subdivision of the state must identify potential SALs through survey of public
lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC)
Division of Archeology administers the code’s provisions. Archeological surveys must be conducted
under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC in accordance with the provisions of the code. This
project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4471 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon
S. Young.
Because funding for TCSUD’s waterline construction came in part from the Rural Development Office of
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the project is also subject to the provisions of
Section 106 the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the NHPA is to
consider the effects on cultural resources by actions that are federally funded or permitted, or which occur
on federal property. Protection of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) that depends on site significance as defined by National Park Service
(NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) is the final arbiter of the
Section 106 process, though in practice the process is typically limited to review and concurrence by the
involved agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the THC.

The field investigations were designed to comply with appropriate archeological field methods as defined
in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe
all cultural resources discovered within the monitoring areas, evaluate their eligibility for inclusion to the
NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should archeological historic properties or sites be located,
make recommendations for future management options such as avoidance and preservation or further
investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area is in the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province (Fenneman 1938) and the
Blackland Prairie vegetation zone (Hatch et al. 1990:2). The topography of the Blackland Prairie is nearly
level to sloping with elevations not exceeding 700 feet above mean sea level and is drained by the Brazos
River which flows just west of Marlin (Hatch et al. 1990).
Geology of the monitoring area along FM 339 consists of the Tehuacana Member of the Eocene
Kincaid Formation limestone described as
Limestone, glauconitic, hard, indurated, grayish white, interbedded with gray marl, forms
crest of prominent northwest-facing cuesta; thickness up to 30 feet, absent south of
Brazos (Barnes 1970).
Geology of the Big Sandy Creek monitoring area consists of recent (Holocene) alluvium comprised of
gravel, sand, silt, and silty clay found on floodplain deposits and low terraces (Barnes 1970). Regionally,
Holocene alluviums have consistently been shown to contain buried cultural deposits.
Soils in the FM 339 monitoring area belong to the Crockett-Normangee soil mapping unit, which are
"nearly level to moderately sloping, very deep, moderately well drained, loamy soils on uplands" (Griffen
1998:5). Along the unnamed tributary of Rocky Creek is Tinn clay, frequently flooded, which formed in
calcareous clayey alluvium eroded from adjacent Blackland Prairie (Griffen 1998: Figures 23 and 111).
North and south of the Tinn clay, frequently flooded, are areas of Houston black clay, 1 to 3 percent
slopes that parallel the creek channel. This soil formed in situ from calcareous clays and marls (Griffen
1998:94). At the Big Sandy Creek monitoring area, soils consist of Ovan silty clay, frequently flooded,
which formed in calcareous clayey alluvium (Wyrick 1978:56).
The project area is located within the Texan biotic province, which is transitional between the Austroriparian
province forests to the east and the Balconian and Kansan grasslands to the west (Blair 1950). The project
area is encompassed within the Post Oak Savannah, which is a gently rolling, moderately dissected wooded
plain. The native vegetation consists of short trees in association with tall grasses (Hatch et al. 1990:3). Trees
include post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), elm (Ulmus spp.), junipers
(Juniperus spp.), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), and hickories (Carya spp.). Understory shrubs and vines
include yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), coralberry (Symphoricarpos
orbiculatus), greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox), and grapes (Vitis spp.). The climax grasses include little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium var. frequens), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass (Panicum
virgatum), and silver bluestem (Bothriochloa saccharoides).

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A review of records available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and on the THC’s
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was conducted to determine the presence of any previously recorded sites
or previous project areas in or adjacent to the monitoring areas. The review indicated that no previously
recorded sites are located in, or adjacent to, the two monitoring areas. The nearest sites and previous
project areas include the 2000 TCSUD water line survey (Brown et al. 2001) and a Soil Conservation
Service survey several kilometers southwest of the monitoring area (Nunley 1978).
The original TCSUD archeological survey was conducted by Blanton & Associates in 2000 (Brown et al,
2001). Field investigations resulted in the recording of nine previously unrecorded sites (41FA66,
41FA67, 41FA68, 41LT294, 41LT295, 41LT296, 41LT297, 41LT298, and 41LT299), which included
eight historic sites (41FA67, 41FA68, 41LT294, 41LT295, 41LT296, 41LT297, 41LT298, and 41LT299)
and one prehistoric site (41FA66). Also documented was previously recorded historic site 41RT168
(Roberts County) that was initially recorded in 1983 during survey efforts on the Twin Oaks Mine (TARL
site files).
Several historic sites (41LT294–297) were recorded along the TCSUD waterlines paralleling FM 147
between Odds and the FM 147/FM 339 intersection northwest of the monitoring area. An additional site
(41LT298) was recorded during the same survey just east of the FM 147/FM 339 intersection on the south
side of the highway and northeast of the current study area. Sites 41LT294 and 41LT296–298 are historic
house sites but have no standing structures. One standing structure recorded was the Carter House
(41LT295), a pre-1940 tenant house. None of the sites discovered during the TCSUD survey were
recommended as eligible for the NRHP or for formal SAL designations (Brown et al. 2001).
Approximately two kilometers southwest of the monitoring area adjacent to FM 339 is prehistoric site
41LT211 that was recorded along Big Creek during a survey for twelve proposed floodwater retarding
structures to be built in the Big Creek watershed, Falls, Limestone, and McLennan Counties, Texas. The
site consisted of a low-density surface scatter of chipped-stone debitage and no further investigations
were recommended for this site (Nunley 1978).

METHODS
During the water line trench excavations at the monitoring areas, an archeologist examined the walls and
floor of the backhoe trench as soil was removed (to a maximum depth of 36 inches below ground surface)
to look for evidence of buried cultural deposits. After every fourth bucket of soil was removed from the
trench, the archeologist inspected the backfill pile for artifacts. Investigations adhered to THC survey
standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987) and the Secretary
of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983).
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian examination of the ground surface within the
monitoring areas to look for any evidence of archeological materials on the easement that may have been
brought to the surface during the construction of the water line outside of, and adjacent to, the designated
monitoring areas. The two monitoring locales were plotted with hand-held global positioning system
(GPS) receivers and field investigations were photo-documented with digital cameras.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Archeological monitoring for the TCSUD project area occurred along 600 feet of pipeline in the Kosse 3
Segment and along 600 feet in the Marlin 4 Segment in, respectively, Limestone and Marlin counties
(Figures 2 and 3). Backhoe trench excavations for the water lines extended to a maximum depth of
91 centimeters below ground surface and revealed only massive wet, dense, and sticky alluvial clays.
In the Marlin 4 Segment along FM 2958, 300 feet of trenching on both banks of Big Sandy Creek
revealed two massive silty clay strata between 0 and 91 centimeters below ground surface (Figure 4).
Zone I (0 to 45–50 centimeters below ground surface) was wet dense, and sticky black (10YR 2/1) clay
with numerous tree roots, rootlets and occasional gravels with a clear and smooth lower boundary. Zone
II (45–50 to 91 centimeters) was wet, very dense, and sticky very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay with
common tree roots and rootlets. The lower boundary was not observed as excavations terminated at depth.
Monitoring discovered no archeological materials in the trench walls, floor, or backfill.
In the Kosse 3 Segment along FM 339 in Limestone County, 300 feet of trench excavations on both sides
of the unnamed tributary of Rocky Creek exposed two massive clay strata between 0 and 91 centimeters
(Figure 5). Zone I (0 to 35–40 centimeters) was wet, dense, and sticky very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2)
silty clay with many rootlets and few roots with a gradual smooth lower boundary. Zone II (35–40 to
91 centimeters) consisted of wet, dense, and very sticky dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay with
occasional calcium carbonate filaments and small (up to one centimeter diameter) masses. The lower
boundary was not observed as excavations terminated at depth. Monitoring discovered no archeological
materials in the trench walls, floor, or backfill.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Archeological monitoring efforts by Blanton & Associates in the Marlin 4 and Kosse 3 Segments of the
TCSUD project area discovered no surficial or buried prehistoric or historic archeological deposits, only
massive wet, dense, and sticky alluvial clays. Thus, waterline construction in the monitoring areas had no
effect on any archeological sites eligible for formal SAL designation or archeological historic properties
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. Blanton & Associates recommends therefore that the TCSUD has
fulfilled its Section 106 and Antiquities Code of Texas compliance and the project should be granted
archeological clearance without the need for additional investigations. However, if it is determined that
TCSUD requires additional impacts to occur outside of the utility easement and monitoring areas, then
further archeological investigations would be necessary in those areas prior to any additional construction
occurs.
