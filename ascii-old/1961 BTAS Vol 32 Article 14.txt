Significance of A New Radiocarbon Date
from the Lewisville Site
WILSON W. CROOK, JR., AND R. K. HARRIS

A new test of the charcoal from Hearth 8 at the Lewisville site in Denton
County, Texas (Crook and Harri s, 1957, 1958 ), h as been released by the University
of California at Los Angeles (F ergusson 3nd Libby, 1962) with a elate expressed as
"greater than 38,000" years ago B. P.
This compares favorably with the previous Humble run on the same material
of " greater than 37,000" (Brannon et al., 1957 ) . The specimen is reported as
UCLA-110, whereas the Humble laboratory analysis was listed as 0-248. Milton
Williams of Humble's Production Research Division, Houston, Texas, submitted
the sample for cross-checking.
Four small logs, burned into excellent charcoal, from Hearth 8 produced the
original dating as a check on the similar Â·'greater than 37,000" result from charred
fibrous vegetable material excava ted in Hearth 1 at Lewisvill e (Humble sample
0- 235). Relatively remarkable for an early site, and particularly so to be of an
ideal quality for the radiocarbon technique, the Hearth 8 charcoal was so abundant
that two full tins have been sealed and preserved in the writers' possession. This is
available for possible future checks if further testing is desirable or when new
techniques and innovations in dating arise.
Humble's original work appeared to be definitive when two different samples,
of different materials and from different locations within the same site, corroborated
each other. The UCLA determination almost completely removes any possible criticism of the radiocarbon method of dating in this instance. It will be recalled that
Libby, then with the University of Chicago, developed the process to its first full
application to unknown age materials of archeologic interest in 1950 (Johnson,
1951 ).
Unquestionably, in light of today's knowledge, this then is the approximate age
of the Lewisville site and the Upper Shuler member or sub-formation of the
Pemberton Hill-Lewisville alluvial terrace of the Upper Trinity River system, in
which the site is contained.
From a paleontologica l view, it is also the approximate age not only for the
species identified at Lewisville but for others found up and downstream in the same
terrace formation along the Upper Trinity. Further confirmation of such a conclusion has already been received by the F-U-N analyses conducted on various fossil
bone finds from the several sub-formations or members of the Pemberton HillLewisville terrace by the University of London (Oakley and Howells, 1961, plus
commentary by Crook, 1961). Not only were the bones essentially contemporary
by the F-U-N tests from all alluvial terrace exposures, both up and downstream

328

from Dallas, but also regardless of whether they came from the basal Hill gravels
or the Lower Shuler sands and Upper Shuler sandy clays above.
In addition, this conclusion is further reinforced by the finclings at the Clear
Creek paleontoiogical quarry in north central Denton County (Slaughter et al.,
1962.). Here an exposure into a late, upstream remnant of the Pemberton HillLewisville terrace of the Elm Fork of Trinity River has yielded a fauna indicative
of approaching cooler conditions, though still relatively arid , and has been
radiocarbon-dated by Mobil Oil Company's research laboratory near Dallas as being
"greater than 28,850," based upon freshwater shellfish remains.
In short, everything-dates, fauna, flora, and geology-suggest a non-glacial
(inter-stadia! or interglacial, as it may be)-period for the T-2. or Pemberton HillLewisville terrace of the Upper Trinity system. I n Europe, there is accumulating
evidence of such a period between about 2.8,000 and 42.,000 years ago; this has
been variously referred to as the Masurian er Paudorf interstadial.
American geologists generally recognize such a period prior to the last major
glaciation of ca. 25,000 years ago, but there is vast disagreement currently as to the
definition of what was formerly called the Wisconsin, and whether or not such a
preceding non-glacial period is in truth the last interglacial or a major interstadial
within a now-greatly-enlarged "Wisconsin." Paleontologically, the animal species
match what was formerly considered Sangamon interglacial, but a southwardretreat, followed by a northward re-entry during a succeeding interstadial, is
possible.
In any event, this was the time that man visited Lewisville repeatedly. Based
not only upon the animals apparently captured and brought to the campfires at
this site, but also upon many recent paleontologic discoveries from the same terrace
deposits within the immediate area (Slaughter et al., 1961), some interesting contemporaries bespeak warmer climate.
Foremost are the land turtles: Geochelone or giant tortoise is today confined to
the tropics, and Terrapene canaliculata ( huge direct ancestor of the living Carolina
terrapin, itself confined to southern United States today) has Lewisville as its
farthest-north recorded fossil occurrence.
The coyote from Lewisville has since been studied and deemed worthy of subspecies differentiation (Slaughter, 1961 ), with the very interesting circumstance
of having only the living form from Honduras as being somewhat similar. Members of the armadillo family are highly suseptible to cold, and it is notable that
three different large ones are present in the terrace: Glyptodon as reported by
White for Lewisville itself; Holmesina from the Hickory Creek site upstream from
Lewisville, and from Dallas downstream; and Dasypus from Dallas.
A 10--12. foot alligator has been found in the same terrace at Dallas; to reach
such size today requires a climate comparable to the southern Louisiana bayous or
the Florida Everglades. Finally, there are the palmetto stumps found beneath
the terrace deposit near Grand Prairie some years ago.
Tapir, found today only in tropical regions such as Central America, South
America, and Malaya, has been a fossil find in the Lewisville terrace deposits in
three areas-Elm Fork of the Trinity near Lewisville, and twice near Dallas.
Of course the vast majority of the accompanying fauna is adapted to wide variations within the North Temperate Zone, and there are a few cool-suggestive forms
such as meadow voles for paradoxes, but there are no downright boreal or arctic
types at all. The warm group shows which way the wind blew in Lewisville times.
It is becoming evident that this was about the time o.f arrival in Europe of Homo

sapiens, already fully developed from som e place else. If " som e pl ace else" had
been N orth A sia, it is not improbable that h e migrated in the direction of Am erica
as well. Based upon his performance during last glacial times in Europe, his
culture had advanced to where he could survive the bitter winters that must have
prevailed even in inter-stadial-interglacial times, as today , in the Bering Strait
region. H owells (1959) suggests that the "Am erica n Indian" type may have been
the basic population of northeastern Asia before being submerged by the more
specialized Mongloids that perhaps evolved later ; isolated in America, they may
h ave lingered on.
Incidentally, Wormington (person al communica tion ) of the D en ver Mu seum of
Natural History has commented that the Lewisville chopper would be quite at
home in a number of Siberian collections she h as viewed.
Nevertheless, if man was indeed present at L ewisville at 3 7,000-plus y ea r s ago
in a warm , non -glacial period, he could n ot have been unique. H e was also present
at other local ities at least this far south in North America, and may well alrea dy
have been found elsewhere, but without benefit of radiocarbon dating to back his
credentials! His ancestors mu st have left even earlier campsites to the north on the
migration route. In northern T exas, alone, there is suggestive evidence, based on
geological provenience in the basal Hill gravels of the Lewis vill e terrace, that the
H enderson County stone heads described by Sellards ( 1952) and a h eavily-patinated
scraper found by the writers at P emberton Hill in Dallas, pre-date L ewisville by a
few thousand years.
Already there is a growing trend among scholars to suspect the existen ce of an
earlier, simpler level of Paleo-Ameri can cu lture as typified by non -projectile point
sites bearing a blade-chopper-scrape r-fl ake industry. Severa l such sites have been
radiocarbon dated (Tule Springs, Santa Rosa Island) with ea rliest indica tions
reaching the 30,000 years ago period. M any, including VVormington, would welcome L ewisville into this fold "were it not for that wretched Clovis point. " Texas
h as a considera ble number of blade-chopper-scraper-flake industry sites, unfortun ately none datable as yet, that probably belong to this theory .
Th anks especially to the L ehner mammoth-kill site in Arizona and its 12,000vintage rad iocarbon dates, the Clovis point in Hearth 1 at Lewisville has almost
become the "albatross" around the writers' n ecks. Friends in the profession have
time and again worked up the courage to ask us point-blank, "Did you re ally find
the point in the hearth?" Throw out the Clovis point and dissension almost vani shes
today. But the truth is sometimes awkward to live with ; in addition, to n ega te it
for con venien ce is not scientific. The real problem is that we did find it in
H earth 1, and from the red clay in the cracks and interstices and the caliche coating
over both faces, as found, it appears still to be a genuine inclusion. It is to be hoped
that better explanations will come from future finds.
It is still significant that such early sites do not yield many, if any, chipped
stone projectile points. As such obviously successful hunters at so late a period, this
merely implies that the spears or javelins utilized were tipped with hardwood or
bone points which do not survive in relatively open sites. The Aurignacians arrived in Europe with such a bone-tipped hunting technique, better-preseved in cave
deposits. This supposition probably should be added to the inventory of the earliermentioned blade-chopper-scraper-flake industry in America .
Jn an y event, considering the 9,000-11 ,000 years ago radiocarbon dates now
available from all over the North American continent, plus several in South
America all the way to Tierra del Fuego, it is apparent that by this time man had

330

been in the New VVorld so long that he h ad become widely adapted to local conditions throughout the length and breadth of t h e two continents. This, is in itself by
logi c, infers a tremendously long period previous to evolve such local specializ ations.
Lewisville ma y well cau se the finding of n ew sites, theories, and datings that
will yet far surpass its own value.
