ABSTRACT
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted archaeological signiﬁcance testing from August 6–10,
2007 at site 41WM1028 along the Arterial “A” Roadway project in southern Williamson County, Texas. On
behalf of Williamson County and S. D. Kallman Engineers, L. P., this work was conducted in compliance with
the National Historic Preservation Act and the Texas Antiquities Code under Texas Antiquities Permit 4591. S.
D. Kallman Engineers, L.P., partially ﬁnanced through federal funds administered through Williamson County,
will construct an interim three-lane urban arterial roadway (Arterial “A”), 6,000 feet long within a 120-foot wide
right-of-way (ROW) with associated improvements. Based on the ﬁndings of a previous archaeological reconnaissance and a revisit to 41WM1028 by SWCA, the proposed Arterial “A” route would impact an archaeological
site (41WM1028) recommended for further investigations. Accordingly, the purpose of SWCA’s investigation
was to determine the nature, potential signiﬁcance, and limits of cultural resources within the project area.
The SWCA test excavations at 41WM1028 included excavation of nine backhoe trenches, ﬁve hand-excavated
1 m² units, mapping, and other documentation. The investigations of 41WM1028 encountered a broad scatter of
cultural materials (primarily debitage and burned rock fragments) in both surface and subsurface contexts. The
cultural materials extend about 160 m along the north-south trending Arterial “A” corridor and extend beyond
the margins of the roughly 37-m wide Area of Potential Effects (APE). The majority of the cultural materials
for the site are within the upper 50 cm with the highest frequency occurring at the northern end of the site along
the eastern margin of the survey corridor. The artifact assemblage decreases along the western margins of the
Arterial “A” corridor and toward the southern end of the site. Several small burned rock features were identiﬁed
in trench proﬁles and subsequently hand excavated during the text excavations. These investigations determined
that the vast majority of the deposits retain minimal integrity as a result of bioturbation and agricultural activities
among others. The recovered temporally diagnostic artifacts indicate that the disturbed plow zone and underlying
stratum contains a mixed assemblage of Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric artifacts.
Based on the general lack of integrity and previous impacts, site 41WM1028 within the Arterial “A” alignment
is considered to have minimal potential to contribute new or signiﬁcant information to the local or regional
prehistory. Based on these ﬁndings within the current alignment, SWCA concludes that the project will have
no adverse affects on signiﬁcant cultural resources and recommends no further archaeological work. Therefore,
41WM1028 is not recommended as eligible for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nomination under
Criterion D of 36 CFR 60.4. Site 41WM1028 does not warrant State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. However, any impact beyond the currently conﬁgured ROW warrants additional assessment.
The artifacts and records associated with this project are curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) at The University of Texas at Austin.

SIGNIFICANCE TESTING OF 41WM1028
Ken Lawrence

INTRODUCTION
The following report details the results of archaeological signiﬁcance testing at 41WM1028 by SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) in August 2007
along the proposed Arterial “A” Phase I Project near
Round Rock in Williamson County, Texas (Figure 1.1).
S. D. Kallman Engineers, L.P. partially ﬁnanced by
federal funds administered through Williamson County
will construct an interim three-lane urban arterial roadway (Arterial “A”), which is 6,000 feet long within a
120-foot wide right-of-way (ROW) with associated
improvements. The cultural resource assessment was
carried out on behalf of S. D. Kallman Engineers, L.P.
and was performed in compliance with the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Texas Antiquities Code under Texas Antiquities Permit 4591.
The goal of the work was to determine the nature and
signiﬁcance of previously recorded site 41WM1028
within the project Area of Potential Effects (APE). The
results of these investigations would allow S. D. Kallman Engineers, L.P. to determine whether any further
archaeological work would be necessary and fulﬁll
current project regulatory requirements. SWCA archaeologists Kevin A. Miller, Steve Carpenter, Mindy
L. Bonine, Eric Oskanen, Mary Jo Galindo, Joshua
Gibbs, Daniel Culotta, and Ken Lawrence conducted
the ﬁeldwork from August 6–10, 2007. Steve Carpenter
served as Principal Investigator.
Site 41WM1028 originally documented as a Middle
Archaic burned rock midden located about 3.1 miles
(4.9 km) east-southeast of the Interstate Highway
(IH) 35 and US 79 intersection in Round Rock, Texas,
roughly 1.37 miles (2.2 km) northwest of the intersection of County Road (CR) 122 (Red Bud Lane) and
Forest Creek Drive, and about 0.25 mile (400 m) due
north of Forest Creek Drive. The site lies on the edge
of an upland ridge overlooking Brushy Creek to the
north and topographically situated on an interﬂuve

between two tributary drainages that empty into Brushy
Creek. The surrounding site area contains a mix of
open meadow with short grasses bordered by mixed
timber containing an overstory of oak and scattered
cedar with an understory of sparse short grasses and
areas of exposed limestone bedrock along the toeslope
of the ridge.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AT 41WM1028
Site 41WM1028 was originally recorded in 2002 by
Sergio Iruegas as a Middle Archaic midden with associated lithic scatter (Site Form). The initial recording
documented the presence of lithic debitage, burned
rock fragments, and, rather curiously, the “distal” end
of a Travis point, which was subsequently collected.
Based on the proﬁle from a road cut, the initial recording interpreted the cultural activities as possibly
representative of a single component (Site Form). A
projectile point tip, which is typically not diagnostic,
suggested a Middle occupation (Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory [TARL] ﬁles). The recorder considered the site signiﬁcant and recommended further
investigations.
In early 2007, SWCA revisited site 41WM1028 and
encountered a broadly dispersed scatter of surﬁcial
lithic debitage and ﬁre-cracked rock fragments, particularly evident in the two-track road exposures that
cross the site. Several collectors’ piles were observed
along the northern margin of the site near the edge of
the upland terrace that consisted of chert debitage that
ranged from 12–40 ﬂakes in each pile. At the time, no
temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed on the
surface, which was partly attributed to the collecting
activities (Lawrence 2007).
The revisit of 41WM1028 determined that the cultural
materials were scattered on the surface along 160 m of
the survey corridor (Arterial A) and extended beyond

Signiﬁcance Testing of 41WM1028
the edges of the roughly 37-m wide APE. Most of
the surﬁcial artifacts decreased in frequency as the
site trended southward away from the drainage. The
highest density of surﬁcial artifacts was observed at
the northern end of the site in proximity to the edge
of the ridge top.
The revisit investigations entailed a series of shovel
tests (STs 1–10) excavated on the site in order to verify the presence of subsurface materials and depth of
cultural deposits. Contrary to the initial site recording
that indicated that the site had a single component,
the results of the shovel test excavations appeared
to suggest that site 41WM1028 may have two cultural components. Speciﬁcally, the seven shovel
tests that contained cultural materials (i.e., debitage
and ﬁre-cracked rock) extended from the surface
to 30 cm below surface (cmbs) and again at 50–60
cmbs, possibly suggesting two subsurface cultural
components. At the time of the revisit, the cultural
materials in the lower cultural horizon were possibly
interpreted to have originated in the upper horizon
and subsequently translocated to their current depth
due to bioturbation. However, this explanation was
deemed unlikely due to the consistent depth (50–60
cmbs) at which these artifacts were observed.
Regarding the stratigraphy of 41WM1028, the
SWCA revisit encountered two soil horizons each
appearing to correlate with the presence of cultural
materials (Lawrence 2007). Speciﬁcally, the upper
cultural horizon seemed to be associated with a dark
clay loam upper soil horizon, while the lower cultural
materials appeared to correlate to the lighter silt loam
stratum. Both strata were present on the higher elevation of the landform on the eastern edge of the APE,
thinning to the west and south before disappearing.
Site materials correlated with the presence/absence
of these soils.
The artifact assemblage observed at 41WM1028
includes lithic debitage (roughly 100–200 ﬂakes), a
chipped stone tool fragment, and ﬁre-cracked rock
fragments composed of angular limestone cobbles.
The artifact assemblage at the site is diffusely scattered across the upland ridge, becoming most prevalent at the northern end of the site closest to Brushy
Creek. Since the typing of a distal tip seemed poorly

1-3

substantiated, SWCA considered the temporal afﬁliation for site 41WM1028 as undetermined.
The SWCA revisit of 41WM1028 determined that
the site as observed within the APE had a potential
to provide new or important information regarding
the prehistory of the region, and accordingly recommended avoidance or further investigations. Since
site 41WM1028 could not be avoided by the proposed Arterial A alignment, a strategy for testing the
site was developed to gather additional information
regarding the signiﬁcance of the cultural deposits.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Arterial “A” project area is located about 2.75
miles east of IH-35 in Round Rock, southern Williamson County, Texas (Figure 1.1). The Arterial “A”
roadway is designed to improve circulation and access to the area. The roadway is proposed to be an interim three-lane and ultimate six-lane divided paved
and curb and guttered urban arterial roadway with
an interim three-lane and ultimate six-lane bridge
that will cross over Brushy Creek. This portion of
the project roadway (Phase I) will begin just north
of US 79 at Joe DiMaggio Boulevard near CR 122
and extend south crossing US 79 and Brushy Creek
to terminate at Forest Creek Drive west of Rusk
Road (Figure 1.1). The proposed project crosses
private land that will be donated and/or purchased
and controlled by Williamson County.
SWCA began test excavations at 41WM1028 project
area on August 6, 2007. SWCA’s test investigations
at 41WM1028 consisted of two interrelated and
concurrent activities. The ﬁrst phase of investigation
began with backhoe trench excavation in select areas
along the Arterial “A” APE through the site. The
second phase consisted of several hand excavated
test units positioned along select backhoe trenches
on 41WM1028. The results of these investigations
are the focus of this report, which are discussed in
subsequent chapters.

CHAPTER 2

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Ken Lawrence

INTRODUCTION
Site 41WM1028 is located in central Texas at a junction of varied geology and very diverse vegetation
regions. Speciﬁcally, the site is situated along the
margins of the Balcones Fault zone with the Edwards
Plateau lying to the west and the coastal plain extending to the east. Also, this area is positioned within two
intermingled ﬂoral communities, namely the Cross
Timbers and Prairies region and the Blackland Prairies
region (Correll and Johnston 1979:3–7). This chapter
provides an overview of the highly variable present
day environmental setting of 41WM1028 and a brief
history of the regional paleoenvironmental record. The
discussion is based on the results of ﬁeld investigations
performed by SWCA archaeologists and a review of
relevant literature.

GEOLOGY
Site 41WM1028 is situated on an upland ridge overlooking a fairly prominent drainage (Brushy Creek) to
the north. Geologically, the site is mapped as Upper
Cretaceous age Austin chalk (Barnes 1995). The chalk
and marl of the Austin Chalk formation is described as
grayish-white to white chalk composed of microgranular calcite with large amounts of calcium carbonate
while the marl is characterized as medium gray marl
with recessive bentonitic seams and common nodules
of pyrite (Barnes 1995).
The geology of the area north of site 41WM1028 is
mapped as alluvial ﬂoodplain deposits with Quaternary
ﬂuviatile terrace deposits north of the Brushy Creek
drainage. The alluvial ﬂoodplain within the channel
is characterized as recent clay, silt, sand, and gravel
deposits. The Quaternary deposits are described as
Pleistocene age gravel, sand, silt, and clay occupying
high terraces along streams. The alluvial ﬂoodplain

is characterized as recent clay, silt, sand, and gravel
deposits (Barnes 1995).

SOILS
The soils on and around the ridge top where site
41WM1028 is situated consists of Eddy very gravelly clay loam on the slopes that apron the ridge and
Brackett clay loam covers the ridge top. The Eddy
very gravelly clay loam (3–8 percent slopes) of the
slopes is described as undulating upland soils that are
calcareous and gravelly clay loam overlying shallow
chalk bedrock. The ridge top Brackett clay loam (1–5
percent) is described as gently sloping soil occupying
ridge tops and side slopes and consists of a surface
horizon with clay loam intermixed with limestone
fragments overlying a silty clay loam that extends to
about 80 cmbs (Werchan and Coker 1983).

VEGETATION
Generally deﬁned, site 41WM1028 is positioned along
the border of two overlapping vegetational communities. Speciﬁcally, the Blackland Prairies region that
extends from the site to the east and the Cross Timbers
region that extends westward (Correll and Johnston
1979:Map 1). The Blackland Prairies region is composed of grasses with scattered timber particularly
along drainages while the Cross Timbers and Prairies
region is composed of grasses and open savannah and
brush (Correll and Johnston 1979:3–7).
The typical vegetation for the Blackland prairie region
includes southern hackberry (Celtis laevigata), cedar
elm (Ulmus crassifolia), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica), bois d’arc (maclura pomifera)
with an understory of bunch grasses (e.g., big bluestem,
Indian grass, sideoats grama, and silver bluestem),

2-2

Chapter 2

shrubs, laurel greenbriar (Smilax laurifolia), yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria), American beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana), and coralbean (Erythrina
herbacea) (Correll and Johnston 1979; Kutac and
Caran 1994; Petrides 1988; Schmidly 1983; Simpson
1988; Stein et al. 2003).
As its name implies, the Cross Timbers and Prairies
region broadly ranges from open savannah to dense
brush and timber (Correll and Johnston 1979:7).
Characteristic vegetation of this region includes an
overstory of post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack
oak (Quercus marilandica), ashe juniper (Juniperus
ashei), Texas Buckeye (Aesculus glabra), Texas Ashe
(Fraxinus texensis) Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), pecan (Carya
illinoensis), and some mesquite (Prosopis sp.) with
an understory of bunch grasses (e.g., big bluestem,
Indian grass, Canada wild-rye, hairy grama, and
Texas wintergrass), various shrubs, hairy tridens
(Erioneuron pilosum), laurel greenbriar (Smilax laurifolia), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), saw greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox) (Correll
and Johnston 1979; Cox and Leslie 1999; Kutac and
Caran 1994; Petrides 1979; Schmidly 1983; Simpson
1988; Stein et al. 2003; Vines 1997).

FAUNA
Two biotic provinces divide Williamson County
(Blair 1950). The western half of Williamson
County lies within the Balconian biotic province
that comprises the Edwards Plateau region (Blair
1950). The eastern half of the county is within the
Texan biotic province, which extends from central
Texas to east-central Oklahoma (Blair 1950). Site
41WM1028 is situated along the margins of these
two biotic provinces.
The Balconian and Texan biotic provinces are transitional zones extending from the mesic forests of
eastern North America to the xeric grasslands of
the central United States, which provide a varied
habitat that contains a high faunal diversity. At least
49 species of mammal, 57 species of reptiles, and 23
species of amphibians have been identiﬁed as native
to the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950). For the
Balconian biotic province, Blair (1950) identiﬁes

57 species of mammal, over 42 species of reptile,
and 15 species of amphibians. None of the fauna
for the Balconian is restricted solely to this province
(Blair 1950).
Some mammals common to the Balconian province
include: oppossum (Didelphis virginiana), eastern
pipistrel (Pipistrellus subﬂavus), eastern fox squirrel
(Sciurus niger), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus
ﬂoridanus), pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus), valley pocket gopher
(Thomomys bottae), and badger (Taxidus taxus) (Burt
and Grossenheider 1976).
Some native mammals common to the Texan biotic
province include: oppossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern fox
squirrel (Sciurus niger), pocket gopher (Geomys
breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus
leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus),
eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus ﬂoridanus),
swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus) (Burt and Grossenheider 1976).
Mammals common to both of these provinces include
coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), mink (Mustela vison), muskrat (Ondata
zibethica), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk
(Mephitis mephitis), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Historically, red wolf, gray wolf,
bison, jaguar, pronghorn, and black bear ranged into
or near these regions (Burt and Grossenheider 1976;
Huebner 1991; Schmidly 1983).
The general reptilian assemblage for both provinces
include the Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata
emoryi), Eastern yellowbelly racer (Coluber constrictor ﬂaviventris), Yellow mud turtle (Kinosternon
ﬂavescan ﬂavescan), bullfrog (Rana catesbiana),
southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia), and the gulf
coast toad (Bufo vallicepus) (Blair 1950; Conant and
Collins 1998; Kutac and Caran 1994).

Environmental Setting

PALEOENVIRONMENT
Over the past 12,000 years, the environmental and
climatic conditions of the Central Texas region have
varied considerably. There is some debate about the
paleoenvironmental conditions ca. 12,000–10,000
B.P., and two models are presently posited for the
paleoenvironment of this early period. Bryant and
Holloway (1985) have proposed that the Central
Texas region was predominantly a deciduous forest
65,000–10,000 years ago, with a diverse assortment
of tree and plant species. In contrast, more recent
research by Hall and Valastro (1995) and Toomey et
al. (1993) suggests that Central Texas was dominated
by grassland and mesic climatic conditions during
the late Pleistocene. This interpretation ﬁts well with
the regional faunal record since megafaunal species from this period such as mastodon, mammoth,
giant bison, camel, and horse would have required
substantial areas of grassland for grazing (Dillehay
1974; Graham 1987; Graham and Lundelius 1984;
Toomey et al. 1993).
About 10,000 years ago, changes in palaeoclimatic
conditions led to mass extinctions of megafauna
across the region (Graham 1987; Graham and Lundelius 1984). Faunal records from the Edward’s Plateau
indicate the average seasonal temperature warmed,
and climatic conditions became progressively drier
(but still retained higher effective moisture than
present day) throughout the early Holocene (Bement
1994; Toomey et al. 1993). As a result, vegetation
cover diminished, and a degradation of the soil
mantle ensued (Toomey et al. 1993:316). Johnson
and Goode (1994:20) argue that the early Holocene
warming and drying trend experienced on the Edwards Plateau did not impact the Post Oak Belt. Due
to the wind currents and temperature patterns of the
nearby Gulf of Mexico, palaeoclimatic conditions
experienced east of the Edwards Plateau may have
been relatively warm and moist during this time
(Johnson and Goode 1994:20).
Toomey et al. (1993:309) propose that the early
Holocene warming trend continued into the middle
and late Holocene and peaked ca. 5,000–2,500 B.P.
“when climatic conditions were drier than any time
during the last 20,000 years.” Johnson and Goode
(1994:5) also recognize this extreme xeric period and

2-3

describe it as the “Dry Edward’s Interval.” Following
this extensive dry period, the wetter and warmer conditions returned to the region until ca. 1,500–1,000
B.P. (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Johnson and Goode
1994; Toomey et al. 1993). From this time forward,
present-day climatic and environmental conditions
were ﬁrmly established for south-central Texas.

CULTURAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
Williamson County, that encompasses site 41WM1028,
is situated within the northeastern margin of the Central
Texas archaeological region, which extends across
the eastern half of the Edwards Plateau and includes
portions of the Blackland Prairie and Post Oak Belt
(Prewitt 1981:71). Although arbitrarily deﬁned, the
Central Texas archaeological region is delineated by a
combination of physiographic characteristics that are
thought to have inﬂuenced prehistoric systems of subsistence and settlement (Pertulla 2004). This chapter
discusses some of the important archaeological sites of
the Central Texas region and those sites in the immediate vicinity of 41WM1028. These brief summaries of
previous investigations are offered with the intent of
demonstrating a localized model of the archaeological
record. These local investigations ultimately contribute
to our broader understanding of the regional culture
history, which is also summarized in this chapter.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED PREHISTORIC
SITES IN THE VICINITY OF 41WM1028
There are ﬁve archaeological sites within a mile of
41WM1028. Of these, four sites are prehistoric or
have a prehistoric component and include 41WM12,
41WM465, 41WM467, and 41WM780, which are
discussed in the following paragraphs.
Site 41WM12 is located north of 41WM1028 and is
a large prehistoric occupational site located north of
Brushy Creek. The site is a long, linear, east-west oriented prehistoric campsite, parallel to the creek. Site
41WM12 was originally recorded in 1959 by the University of Texas and was subsequently investigated in
1960 by J. Greer, in 1981 by C. J. Jurgens, and in 1986
by Espey Huston and Associates. These investigations
documented the presence of a large surﬁcial scatter
of lithic debitage, cores, various chipped stone tool

fragments, and projectile points. The projectile points
are recorded as having been collected. No temporal
information is provided for site 41WM12. However,
the base of a Folsom point is reported to have been
collected from the site suggesting a Paleoindian component. Further investigations were recommended for
site 41WM12 by these early investigators. However,
this site was evaluated by SWCA during the previously
mentioned Phase I portion of the Arterial “A” survey.
This site was not considered signiﬁcant and no further
investigations were recommended (Lawrence 2007).
Site 41WM465 is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) as the Kenney’s Fort Site.
The fort was established in 1839 by Thomas Kenney
and consisted of a blockhouse and several log cabins
(Scarbrough 2006). It was built to protect the northernmost settlement of the Colorado River frontier from
neighboring Comanche Indians (Scarbrough 2006).
Although government soldiers were stationed nearby
at Camp Williamson in 1839–1840, settlers generally
defended the fort. The name was brieﬂy changed to Fort
Dunnington when a major general planned a retaliatory
expedition against the Comanche, however the plans
were abandoned and the fort was renamed Kenney’s
Fort. The Texas-Santa Fe expedition was assembled
near the fort at Camp Cazneau and state records were
surrendered near the fort during the Archive War. A
part of the ﬂagpole is the only known remnant of the
fort, however historic features may be buried within its
probable location. A historical marker was erected in
1936 a half mile north of the site (Scarbrough 2006). In
addition to its historical signiﬁcance, the site contains
evidence of a prehistoric occupation. Unfortunately,
little information is provided regarding the prehistoric
component of this site. The site was listed on the NRHP
in 1987. The general location of the fort site (though
its exact spot is undetermined) is approximately 300
m west of 41WM1028.

Chapter 3

Site 41WM467 is located north of Brushy Creek
approximately 0.25 mile northwest of the project
area. The site is a prehistoric open campsite consisting of chert ﬂakes and burned rock exposed in a cut
bank. Further investigations were recommended to
determine the extent of the site beneath the surface
and its signiﬁcance (Site Form).
Site 41WM780 is a multi-component site located
south of Brushy Creek and approximately 0.21 mile
east of 41WM1028. The site consists of a historic
cotton farm and a prehistoric open campsite. The site
was the original location of the James H. Bell House,
which was later relocated to Pioneer Farm to be used
as a living history center. Currently, the site consists
of a small concrete slab marking the northeast corner
of the house print, a cistern and a historic scatter. A
lithic scatter and burned rock midden were observed
at the site north of the historic manifestations. The
prehistoric occupation was determined to be potentially eligible for the NRHP and further investigations were recommended for both the historic and
prehistoric components.

RELEVANT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES IN
THE REGION
Two archaeological sites situated along the Brushy
Creek drainage are particularly relevant to the investigation of site 41WM1028. The Blackland Prairie
site (41WM815) is located about 10.75 miles (17.25
km) downstream while the Wilson-Leonard site
(41WM235) is located roughly 8.5 miles (13.6 km)
upstream of 41WM1028.
The Blackland Prairie site (41WM815) is a Late Archaic site situated on the alluvial terraces of Brushy
Creek located about 750 m to the south (Brownlow
2003). This site was initially encountered in 1994
and was extensively investigated in 1999. During
the investigation of the site James Abbott identiﬁed
ﬁve stratigraphic units for the Brushy Creek drainage
and the surrounding area (Brownlow 2003). The ﬁve
stratigraphic units (Units I–V) begin with Unit I at the
base, and were identiﬁed through backhoe trenches
and core sampling conducted during the survey of
the project. Stratigraphic Unit I is in the center of

the valley and composed of dark yellowish-brown
clay loam, loam, and silty clay over silty gravel and
based on a radiocarbon sample, dates to 10960±60
(Brownlow 2003:183–185). Unit II, situated in the
center of the valley, consists of grayish-brown to
yellowish-brown loams deposited during the longest
period of alluvial deposition. The drainage based on
ﬁve radiocarbon samples ranges from 11950±90 to
4140±70 (Brownlow 2003:185). This stratigraphic
unit was observed to contain prehistoric material
(Brownlow 2003:186). Unit III was deposited in
roughly the same location of the existing Brushy
Creek channel and consists of brown silt loam-silty
clay loam with strongly developed calcium carbonate ﬁlaments (Brownlow 2003:186–187). Based on
three radiocarbon samples, Unit III ranges in age
from 3360±60 to 1910±50 (Brownlow 2003:185).
Stratigraphic Unit IV consists of grayish-brown loam
to clay loam with moderate amounts of soft carbonate
masses (Brownlow 2003:187). Based on one sample
this stratigraphic unit was dated to 6430±70, but was
subsequently rejected (Brownlow 2003:185). The
ﬁnal horizon is Unit V and consists of grayish-brown
loam that grades to silt and silty clay loams. Based
on three samples (with one rejected sample), Unit V
ranges in age from 1420±60 to 1010±40 (Brownlow
2003:185–187).
Wilson-Leonard is a deeply stratiﬁed, prehistoric
site with quaternary fill deposits of the Brushy
Creek valley extending over 6 m in depth (Collins 1998:1). This site, initially recorded in 1973
and subsequently investigated for over 20 years, is
situated along the southern bank of Brushy Creek
drainage. It is considered one of the most signiﬁcant
prehistoric sites in Texas due to the nearly unbroken
record of human occupation and environmental data
from 12,000–1,000 B.P. that is contained within the
alluvium and colluvium at Wilson-Leonard (Collins 1998; Oskanen et al. 2003). The extensively
examined stratigraphy of Wilson-Leonard will be
compared to that encountered at site 41WM1028.
The stratigraphy of the Wilson-Leonard site is long
and complicated and will not be thoroughly discussed
here. However, the Wilson-Leonard investigations
identiﬁed three ﬂuvial terrace deposits (Q-1 to Q-3)
for the Brushy Creek drainage, that each contain interior strata (Collins 1998). The oldest terrace is the

Cultural Setting
Q-3 deposit that is Pleistocene in age and contains
various clays and clay loams with varying amounts
of calcium carbonate (Collins 1998:13). This deposit is indicated to correlate with the Fairlie clay
and Denton clay loam in some locations as well as
Sunev silty clay in other locations (Collins 1998:13).
The Q-2 deposit is indicated to range from the late
Pleistocene to the late Holocene consisting of silt
and limestone gravel and sand (Collins 1998:13–14).
The Q-2 deposit is indicated to correlate with Unit
II identiﬁed by Abbott’s investigations (Brownlow
2003:188). The age of the Q-1 deposit is unknown,
but it is younger than the Q-2 deposit and contains
gray to grayish-brown silty loam to clay loam (Collins 1998:13–14). This deposit is indicated to correlate with the Oakalla series (Collins 1998:14).
Site 41WM1028 occupies an interﬂuve between two
intermittent drainages on an upland ridge. The stratigraphy across the site varies slightly with position
on the landscape, particularly with respect to proximity to crest of the small ridge. The soils mapped
for 41WM1028 are indicated to be Brackett clay
loam characterized as gently sloping soil occupying
ridge tops with clay loam intermixed with limestone
fragments overlying a silty clay loam that extends
to about 80 cmbs (Werchan and Coker 1983). The
soils observed on the site during the test excavations
do not exactly correlate with that observed during
either the Blackland Prairie or Wilson-Leonard site
investigations. Admittedly, site 41WM1028 occupies an upland setting while the Blackland Prairie
and Wilson-Leonard sites are in a lowland setting.
Therefore, the depositional history should not correspond exactly.

PREHISTORIC CULTURE HISTORY
The following cultural-historic outline is based on the
chronologies proposed by Collins (2004) and Johnson and Goode (1994) for the Central Texas region,
which build upon the seminal efforts of Suhm (1960)
and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Dates are reported as years
before present (B.P.), and the cultural sequence is
divided into four periods: Paleoindian, Archaic,
Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The Archaic period
is subdivided into four subperiods: Early, Middle,
Late, and Transitional.

3-3

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
(11,500–8,800 B.P.)
Paleoindian artifacts and sites date from about
11,500–8,800 B.P. and are not uncommon in Central
Texas (Collins 2004). The period begins during the
close of the Pleistocene with the earliest evidence
of humans in the Central Texas region. Diagnostic
artifacts of the period include lanceolate-shaped,
fluted projectile points such as Clovis, Folsom,
and Plainview. These projectile points were hafted
onto wooden spears, launched from atlatls (spear
throwers), and often used to hunt big game such
as mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse
(Black 1989). During the Paleoindian period, a
hunter-gatherer adaptation strategy was employed
with increased harvesting of ﬂora and small game
as the big game died off and the climate warmed
following the end of the Pleistocene ice age. Representative Central Texas Paleoindian sites include
Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, Gault, and
St. Mary’s Hall (Collins 2004).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
(8,800–1,200 B.P.)
As the Paleoindian period came to an end, humans
began to harvest more intensively local ﬂoral and
faunal resources (Collins 2004). Material culture
became more diverse, and the use of burned rock
middens and ovens became widespread. This period
is known as the Archaic period and dates from approximately 8,800–1,200 B.P. in Central Texas (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994). While Collins
(2004) and Johnson and Goode (1994) subdivide the
Archaic into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods,
we have added the Transitional subperiod after the
Late Archaic for reasons discussed in the following
paragraphs.

EARLY ARCHAIC SUBPERIOD
(8,800–6,000 B.P.)
Early Archaic artifacts and sites date from about
8,800–6,000 B.P. (Collins 2004). Once thought to
be Paleoindian in age, some unstemmed point types
such as Angostura have recently been recognized

3-4

Chapter 3

as the ﬁrst Early Archaic diagnostic styles (Collins
2004). Around 8,000 B.P., these points were replaced
by stemmed varieties such as Early Split Stem,
Martindale, and Uvalde (Black 1989; Collins 2004).
Most sites were open campsites although cave sites
have been found (Collins 2004). Current site distribution data suggest that Early Archaic peoples were
concentrated along the eastern and southern margins
of Edwards Plateau in areas with more stable water
sources (Collins 2004; McKinney 1981). Specialized tools, perhaps used in woodworking, known as
Guadalupe and Nueces bifaces, were prevalent in
this period (Collins 2004). While subsistence data
are sparse, it appears that people were hunting deer
and other small animals, ﬁshing, and cooking bulbs
in earth ovens (Collins 2004). This strategy evolved,
in part, due to the extinction of megafauna and the
changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene
(McKinney 1981).

MIDDLE ARCHAIC SUBPERIOD
(6,000–4,000 B.P.)
Middle Archaic artifacts and sites date from about
6,000–4,000 B.P. with multi-use bifacial knives
becoming more common. Characteristic Middle
Archaic projectile points include Bell, Andice, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis, several of which are deeply
notched (Black 1989). These artifacts could have
served as knives and projectile points. Bison were
hunted intensively at the start of the Middle Archaic,
but, as the climate became drier, a reliance on dry
climate plants such as sotol probably became common. The end of the Middle Archaic may have been
the most xeric conditions ever in Central Texas (Collins 2004). The climatic change was accompanied by
a technological change as Nolan and Travis points,
which are thick and have narrow blades, ﬁrst appeared in the archaeological record (Collins 2004).
Burned rock middens and earth ovens ﬁrst appeared
circa 5,000 B.P. and became increasingly common,
although their exact functions may have varied based
on the culture and environment (Johnson and Goode
1994). Representative sites of the Texas Middle Archaic include the Landslide, Wounded Eye, Gibson,
and Panther Springs sites (Collins 2004).

LATE ARCHAIC SUBPERIOD
(4,000–2,250 B.P.)
Late Archaic artifacts and sites date from about
4,000–2,250 b.p. The period began with very xeric
conditions but gradually became more mesic (Collins
2004). Characteristic dart point types include Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, and Marcos (Collins
2004). Increasingly complex and sedentary cultural
manifestations ﬁrst appeared in the Late Archaic.
Sites of the Late Archaic are very common and
include burned rock middens, open campsites, and
lithic procurement sites. Large cemeteries and grave
goods suggest population increases. Also, trade and
exchange networks between cultures appear to have
increased in complexity as evidenced by exotic goods
in sites and cemeteries (Black 1989). Bement (1991)
interprets the evidence for group investment in the
Thunder Valley sinkhole cemetery, dated to 2,900
b.p. based on stratigraphy, to indicate that groups
were declaring control over a particular territorial
range during the Late Archaic. Representative sites
of the Central Texas Late Archaic include the Anthon
and Loeve Fox sites (Collins 2004).

TRANSITIONAL ARCHAIC SUBPERIOD
(2,250–1,250 B.P.)
As Collins (2004:122) notes, “diverse and comparatively complex archeological manifestations toward
the end of the Late Archaic attest to the emergence
of kinds of human conduct without precedent in the
area.” The changes at this time have been attributed to increases in size and/or the introduction of
religious practices (Collins 2004). Regardless, this
unique time of change (2,250–1,250 B.P.) is referred
to here as the Transitional Archaic (Turner and Hester
1999) or Terminal Archaic (Black 1989). Johnson
et al. (1962) originally designated the Transitional
Archaic as a subperiod of the Archaic because of the
similarities between the latest dart point types and
the earliest arrow point types. During the Transitional
Archaic, smaller dart point forms such as Darl, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio were developed (Turner and
Hester 1999). These points were probably predecessors to the ﬁrst Late Prehistoric arrow point types
and may have overlapped temporally with them
(Hester 1995). Several researchers believe that the

Cultural Setting
increased interaction between groups at the end of the
Late Archaic was an important catalyst for cultural
change (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994).
This change may have included increased regional
stress and conﬂict between groups as interaction
became more frequent.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
(1,250–260 B.P.)
The end of the Transitional Archaic introduced the
bow and arrow technologies indicated by the increasingly smaller size of projectile points. The Late
Prehistoric period dates from 1,250–260 B.P. (Collins
2004). Characteristic artifacts include small arrowpoints like Perdiz and Scallorn as well as a variety of
speciﬁc use tools. The Austin and Toyah intervals of
the Late Prehistoric, originally recognized by Suhm
(1960) and Jelks (1962), remain accepted divisions
for the period. These style intervals may represent
distinct cultural entities (Johnson 1994), although
others challenge this view (Black and Creel 1997).
During the earlier Austin interval, burned rock
midden use may have reached its maximum based
on recent conclusions by Black and Creel (1997).
Characteristic arrow points of the Austin interval
include Scallorn and Edwards (Collins 2004; Turner
and Hester 1999). By the Toyah interval, plainware
ceramics appeared, indicating possible inﬂuence in
the Central Texas region from ceramic producing
cultures to the east and north (Perttula et al. 1995).
Contrary to bog pollen data (Collins et al. 1993), data
from Hall’s Cave in Kerr County indicate that the
climate of Central Texas began to dry around 1,000
B.P. (Toomey et al. 1993). This drying trend may have
resulted in a change in vegetation that made central
and south Texas more conducive to bison migration
into the area. Bison remains in archaeological sites in
the region became common after 750 B.P. (Dillehay
1974; Huebner 1991).
Most Toyah sites have the distinctive Perdiz arrow
point type, and some sites also have bison processing tool kits. This technological change has been
interpreted as a spread of an ethnic group by Johnson
(1994) and as the spread of technological ideas in

3-5

response to opportunities provided by an increased
bison population in the Late Prehistoric by Ricklis
(1992). Increasing complexity in subsistence patterns
and very high prehistoric populations are postulated
for the Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989; Collins
2004). Although no faunal remains were reported
from the Slab site, archaeologists recovered numerous Perdiz arrow points and Leon Plain ceramics
indicating a Toyah occupation (Patterson 1987).
Representative sites of the Central Texas Late Prehistoric include the Kyle, Smith, and Currie sites
(Collins 2004).

HISTORIC CULTURE HISTORY
The history of Texas is extensive and multifaceted.
For the sake of brevity, the historic cultural history
of Texas has been divided into the Spanish Colonial/
Mexican Independence period, Republic of Texas/
Pre-Civil War period, Post-Civil War/Reconstruction period, and Late Nineteenth/Early Twentieth
Century period. Particular emphasis is placed on
the history of Williamson County throughout each
of these periods.

THE SPANISH COLONIAL/MEXICAN
INDEPENDENCE PERIOD (1630–1821 A.D.)
The Spanish Colonial period (1630–1821 A.D.) may
be characterized as the initial period of Aboriginal/
European contact and European settlement in Texas.
During this time, the general central Texas area was
inhabited by several aboriginal groups including the
Jumano, Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche
(Newcomb 2002). Speciﬁcally to the Williamson
County area, it is believed that small numbers of
Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and Mayeye aboriginal groups also inhabited the area (Odintz 2007).
Odintz (2007) indicates that the ﬁrst Europeans
into the region were probably Spanish explorers
led by Capt. Alonso De León who sought a route
between the Spanish missions in East Texas and
San Antonio. However, this account may be a little
off as Foster (2000) has the 1689 and 1690 entrada
routes mapped further to the south. Regardless, the
Williamson County area was deﬁnitely explored by
1716 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis and Domingo

3-6

Chapter 3

Ramón when during their expedition they camped
somewhere along the present day Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River (Foster 2000; Odintz 2007).
These explorers named the Brushy Creek the Arroyo de las Bendítas Ánimas and the San Gabriel
River the Rio de San Xavier (Odintz 2007). Three
Spanish missions were subsequently established
on the Rio de San Xavier (San Gabriel River) just
outside of Williamson County in Milam County in
the mid-eighteenth century (Odintz 2007; Supplee
2007). During their operation (ca. 1746–1756) the
surrounding area was extensively explored by the
Spanish (Odintz 2007).
After Mexico gained independence from Spain, the
newly formed country used a policy of land grants
to ﬁrst attract Mexican families and then settlers
from the United States to help inhabit the sparsely
populated northern regions of Mexico (Odintz 2007;
Richardson et al. 1983). During the 1820s, Stephen
F. Austin obtained grants from the Mexican government to settle hundreds of families along the lower
Brazos and Colorado Rivers (Webb 1952). This
colony, known as the “Old Three Hundred Colony”,
was successful in pushing the European settlement
frontier further west into the Central Texas region.
Prior to the Texas Revolution, most of the “Old Three
Hundred Colony” settlement was focused south of
Bastrop and the old La Bahia Road (Webb 1952).
However, no substantial settlement occurred from
these efforts to help inhabit the sparsely populated
regions of Williamson County (Odintz 2007).

THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS/PRE-CIVIL WAR
PERIOD (1836–1860 A.D.)
During the Texas Revolution with Mexico, the area
continued to be inhabited only by aboriginal Native
Americans. After the war, a growing Texan population led many settlers to move northwards in search
of open, proﬁtable land to plant crops and raise cattle.
This wave of migration spurred new conﬂicts with
the native groups living in the area, cumulating in
the Battle of Brushy Creek, near what is today the
town of Taylor, in February of 1839. This battle,
between the Comanche and the Texas Rangers and
militia units, resulted in numerous deaths and eventu-

ally resulted in the removal of the Native American
presence in the area.
After the battle, the nearby town of Waterloo, on
the banks of the Colorado River, was renamed
Austin and designated the seat of government for
the Republic of Texas in 1839 (Webb 1952). Williamson County, located north of the new capital
of Texas, was organized shortly afterward in 1848
as the population in the area grew. The county was
named in honor of Robert M. Williamson, an area
leader and a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto.
During this battle, Williamson lost one of his legs
and thereafter, wore a wooden leg, which earned
him the colloquial nickname Three-Legged Willie.
The city of Round Rock was founded in the spring
of 1848 under the name of Brushy Creek. In August
of 1854, due to the insistence of postal ofﬁcials, the
settlement changed its name from Brushy Creek to
the current Round Rock.
Williamson County quickly grew in population and
economic prosperity as the rich soils made agriculture one of the top industries in the area. From
1850–1860 the population of Williamson County
was based on a varied economy of livestock, wheat,
corn, and cotton (Odintz 2007). The census of 1860
recorded a population around 4,529 citizens (both
free and slave residents) with about 38,000 head of
cattle (Odintz 2007). Accompanying the increases
in population and commerce was the rapid adoption
of slave labor. In 1850, two years after the founding
of the county, the slave population in Williamson
County totaled 127. By 1864, less than 15 years later,
the slave count had multiplied by over 10, with an
enslaved population of 1,074 (Campbell 1989:266).
However, the advent of the Civil War (1860–1865
A.D.) negatively affected the economy of the County
(Odintz 2007) and following this war, many of the
planters turned to cattle to regain their ante-bellum
prosperity.

THE POST-CIVIL WAR / RECONSTRUCTION
PERIOD (1865–1890 A.D.)
After the Civil War, Texas entered the Reconstruction
period. Recovery during this period was slow, but
faster than most communities due to growth in the

Cultural Setting
cattle and sheep industries. The economic recovery
was also aided by the Chisholm Trail and other cattle
drive routes that passed through Williamson County
(Odintz 2007). The city of Round Rock served as a
waypoint along the Chisholm Trail for cattle drives
enroute to Kansas. The county’s prosperity and population grew in part to the construction of rail lines in
eastern Williamson County (e.g., International-Great
Northern Railroad), which became an important
transportation center for the cattle industry (Odintz
2007; Scarbrough 2007).
During the 1880s and 1890s the area began to recover
because of improved transportation, growth in the
cattle, sheep, and goat industries, and cotton cultivation (Odintz 2007). Cotton sustained the greatest
increase, growing from a production of 4,217 bales
in 1880 to 80,514 bales by 1900 (Odintz 2007).

LATE NINETEENTH/EARLY TWENTIETH
CENTURY (1890 A.D.–PRESENT)
The economic base of Williamson County shifted
from a reliance on livestock to cotton from the
1890s into the 1900s due to advances in agricultural
technology. By the early twentieth century, roughly
77 percent of the cropland in Williamson County
was used for cotton and was second only to Ellis
County for ginned cotton (Odintz 2007). However,
the advent of the Great Depression seriously affected
Williamson County and Texas in general. The years
during the Great Depression saw a shift from cotton so that by 1959 only 35 percent of the county
farms were growing cotton (Odintz 2007). By the
mid-twentieth century, agricultural crops grown
in Williamson County shifted to corn, sorghum,
and wheat. The livestock industry began to play a
prominent role in the economy of Williamson County
again, which in addition to the traditional cattle and
sheep included poultry farming (Odintz 2007). By
1950, Williamson County was ﬁfth in the state for
chickens and eggs and the county was tenth in the
state for turkey production by the 1980s.
Agriculture and cattle production remained the county’s primary economy through the ﬁrst half of the
twentieth century. However, during the second half
of the twentieth century the county quickly became

3-7

home to numerous large high-tech industries due to
the proximity to Austin. Also during this time the
construction of many housing communities caused
an era of “suburbanization” in Williamson County
(Odintz 2007). The population drastically increased
from roughly 37,305 inhabitants in 1970s to roughly
140,000 by the 1990s (Odintz 2007). Similarly, the
area had a signiﬁcant economic shift from agriculture to industry. During this time, residents were
employed in factories, construction, agribusiness,
trade, services, and local government (Odintz 2007).
This growth and increasingly diverse economy has
continued in Williamson County up to the present.
Currently, the rapid inﬂux of people and industries to
the area continues to be the hallmark of the southern
half of the county while the northern half continues
to rely on agribusiness.

METHODS AND RESEARCH DESIGN
Ken Lawrence

INTRODUCTION
The investigations at 41WM1028 were approached
with both expectations and questions about the nature
of the natural and cultural deposits at the site. Because
little was known of 41WM1028 from the revisit of the
site during the survey of the Arterial A Phase I project,
the questions outnumbered the expectations. Prior to
SWCA’s testing, the known facts of the site included
a broad scatter of lithic debitage and thermally altered
rock fragments, a questionable temporal afﬁliation (i.e.,
distal end of a Travis point), and possibly two buried
cultural components. SWCA, tasked with testing the
site to determine its signiﬁcance, developed a basic
research design, methodology, and scope of work to
guide the excavations. The research design was based
around general issues, and the scope of work was designed to be ﬂexible, given the fact that so little was
known about 41WM1028.

RESEARCH DESIGN
EVALUATING SITE SIGNIFICANCE AND
NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES
ELIGIBILITY
The project was designed to systematically identify,
record, and assess the signiﬁcance of archaeological
materials discovered at 41WM1028. Levels of artifactual and contextual integrity, chronology, potential
data yield, and preservation potential were key criteria
in this evaluation. The investigations focused on two
main issues: integrity and potential data yield.

RESEARCH ISSUE 1: INTEGRITY OF THE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL DEPOSITS
Prior to testing, a primary factor in determining the
signiﬁcance of site 41WM1028 would be the integrity
of its archaeological deposits. One goal of the investigations was to acquire data on depositional context,
deﬁne any relationships between natural strata and
subsurface cultural features/deposits, and determine
if the integrity of the buried deposits was sufﬁcient to
establish relative and/or absolute chronological dates
for any subsurface components and (if applicable) to
subdivide recovered materials into analytical units
relevant to speciﬁc research questions. Therefore,
excavations were performed with sufﬁcient detail
to identify and document the horizontal and vertical
integrity at 41WM1028. The determination of the
horizontal integrity of the cultural deposits assisted
in evaluating and comparing cultural activities and
features encountered across the site. Determining
the integrity of vertical deposits aided in deﬁning
and evaluating cultural components encountered at
41WM1028. If encountered, radiocarbon samples were
to be submitted for analysis to establish a chronology
for the components at the site and as another means of
evaluating integrity (i.e., are the deposits compressed,
are they mixed, are they stratiﬁed?).
Additionally, the integrity of the upland stratigraphy at
41WM1028 was to be compared with the results from
backhoe trenching along the ﬂoodplain of Brushy Creek
during the initial Phase I of the Arterial “A” survey. The
comparison of the presumably colluvial stratigraphy
on the upland ridge to the alluvial stratigraphy of the
Brushy Creek ﬂoodplain may reveal gaps in the depositional record of the area. Admittedly, little is known
of the deposition and integrity of the upland ridge and
suggesting speciﬁc research questions may be hasty.
However, other researchers (Waters and Kuehn 1996)
have demonstrated some success in explaining gaps in

4-2

Chapter 4

the archaeological record through the comparison of
upland and lowland stratigraphy of an area.

RESEARCH ISSUE 2: POTENTIAL DATA
YIELD
A secondary factor in determining the signiﬁcance
of the site would be the potential for additional excavations to recover meaningful data in regards to
SAL criteria. Speciﬁcally, artifacts and other special
samples may be used to address speciﬁc research
questions related to one or more historic contexts
during data recovery. Prior to testing, proposing detailed research questions would have been premature.
SWCA proposed several general questions, which
are relevant to any archaeological investigation, to
be addressed by the testing project, including site
size, function, and chronology. Preservation potential for macrobotanical or faunal remains were also
a criterion used to evaluate potential data yield.
Macrobotanical samples were collected from feature
contexts.
Additionally, prior to testing the initial site recording identiﬁed a Middle Archaic time period
for 41WM1028, which was based upon tenuous
information. Thus, the temporal afﬁliation for site
41WM1028 was uncertain. Furthermore, the initial
site recording indicated a single cultural component
while data from the recent investigations (SWCA
survey) suggested that site 41WM1028 may have
at least two cultural components. Therefore, one of
the goals of testing site 41WM1028 was to determine the temporal afﬁliation and number of cultural
components at the site in order to substantiate and/or
supplement the initial site interpretations. A more secure chronology of the site was to be used to compare
with site distribution models and settlement theories
established by other studies along Brushy Creek, a
natural waterway in Williamson County that has a
high density of prehistoric sites. Speciﬁcally, an established chronology for 41WM1028 was believed
to be more easily compared to other sites of similar
temporal settings in order to determine the site’s
uniqueness (or lack thereof).

EVALUATING SIGNIFICANCE
SWCA proposes that for the site to be found signiﬁcant under SAL criteria, the deposits must demonstrate sufﬁcient integrity and data yield potential
to address speciﬁc, detailed research questions that
contribute to the understanding of the regional prehistory within the framework of one or more historic
contexts. Speciﬁcally, if the site had good integrity
but was stratigraphically dispersed, with low density
of artifacts, no dateable materials, no features, and
poor preservation of organics, it would be less likely
to contribute new or important information. Similarly, if the site had abundant artifacts and materials
but poor archaeological integrity, eligibility would
be contraindicated. In either case, the eligibility will
hinge on its ability to address one or more explicit,
non-trivial questions about prehistory. If the site
was determined eligible and further work was recommended, the testing report would identify such
questions that could be addressed through mitigation and support the determination with an explicit
data presentation in graphic, tabular, and/or textual
format, as appropriate.
As SWCA mentioned prior to testing, recommendations for signiﬁcance were not limited to but could
include an argument developed around one or more
chronological occupational episodes. If radiocarbon assays and/or lithic chronological diagnostics
implied temporal distinction(s); if excavations
conﬁrmed stratigraphic integrity; and if any lithic,
faunal, and/or ﬂoral assemblages were encountered,
then the investigators would graphically illustrate a
sample of attributes of these assemblages grouped by
chronological period. The ability to illustrate samples
of these attributes through time could be the basis
for recommending signiﬁcance.

SCOPE OF WORK AND METHODS
SWCA’s testing investigations utilized a variety of
techniques, including hand excavations and limited mechanical means to further deﬁne the site’s
boundaries to determine the research potential of the
cultural deposits at 41WM1028. SWCA proposed
to excavate about six backhoe trenches and up to
six hand excavation 1-x-1-m units to be allocated

Methods and Research Design
according to the Principal Investigator’s and Project
Archaeologist’s professional judgment.
The backhoe trenches were excavated to roughly
2 m in depth to examine the natural and cultural
stratigraphy at the site and allow the complete recording of all features and geomorphic information
to depths of project impacts. Trench proﬁles were
to be utilized to further deﬁne the site depositional
setting and guide subsequent hand excavations. The
trench walls were cleaned using shovels and trowels,
photographed, and stratigraphically proﬁled as an
initial step in the testing.
The hand-excavated units focused on the 120-foot
(37-m) wide Arterial A, Phase I project corridor
particularly at the northern end of the site overlooking Brushy Creek where previous investigations
observed cultural materials within intact deposits.
The hand excavation units were 1-x-1-m in size,
excavated to 1 m deep in select units or to sterile
deposits, whichever was encountered ﬁrst. Using
standard archaeological methods, the test units were
systematically excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels
and documented using standardized ﬁeld forms and
photographs. All soils were screened through 1/4-inch
hardware mesh. When appropriate, feature ﬁll was
to be screened through 1/8-inch mesh. All artifacts
and pertinent faunal or ﬂoral remains were to be collected for analysis. Features encountered during the
investigations were carefully exposed, documented,
and excavated.

ARTIFACT COLLECTION
All artifacts and samples recovered from each provenience unit were collected, bagged, and labeled
accordingly. Burned rock was quantiﬁed (by size
category) and weighed in the ﬁeld but not collected
unless for the purposes of special sample analysis.

SITE MAPPING
An arbitrary vertical datum with an elevation of 100
m was established at the site (the actual surface elevation is approximately 715 feet above sea level). A
grid was not established at the site. Backhoe trenches
and test units were designated by number (assigned

4-3

sequentially). The locations of all excavations and
features at 41WM1028 were carefully mapped using
a digital theodolite during the testing project. The excavations and site boundaries were related to modern
construction features, the existing topography, and
natural features including Brushy Creek. Additionally, a Garmin eTrex global positioning system (GPS)
hand unit was used to map select site features. The
GPS unit was used to map the backhoe trenches and
site datum during the test excavations.

FEATURE DOCUMENTATION
Buried burned rock features encountered during the
test excavations were numbered (e.g., Feature 1). All
features were exposed in plan, drawn, and photographed. Each feature was thoroughly documented,
cross-sectioned, sampled, and recovered. Detailed
coarse (burned rock) and ﬁne matrix analyses were
conducted, describing the types, counts, and characteristics of the matrices. When appropriate, the
feature matrix was collected and returned to the
laboratory for further processing.

SPECIAL SAMPLES
Prior to testing, special samples were proposed to be
systematically collected from appropriate contexts
across the site. The proposed special samples were
to include materials for radiocarbon dating (from
features, geomorphic units, and other appropriate
contexts, with AMS dating to be used when necessary), matrix samples for ﬂotation and/or ﬁne
screening (from features), possibly pollen/phytolith
samples (from features and systematic retrieval from
site and controls) to aid in paleoenvironmental reconstruction, and possibly burned rock samples for
lipid residue analysis. Unfortunately, no radiocarbon
material was encountered during test excavations for
sampling. Similarly, the context or integrity of the
examined features at 41WM1028 was questionable
and only one bulk matrix sample was collected.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Ken Lawrence

INTRODUCTION
This chapter summarizes the results of SWCA test
excavations conducted at site 41WM1028. The results
from the various excavations (backhoe trench and
hand units) undertaken at the site are discussed. More
detailed information on cultural features and recovered
materials encountered during these excavations are
within the following Chapter 6.

NARRATION AND SUMMARY OF
EXCAVATIONS
TESTING EXCAVATIONS
The SWCA early 2007 revisit of 41WM1028 determined that the site as observed within the APE had a
good potential to provide new or important information
regarding the prehistory of the region. Although the
site has been moderately affected by a variety of disturbances, the site was interpreted to possibly have two
intact buried cultural components. Therefore, SWCA
considered the portions of the site within the Arterial
A APE as potentially signiﬁcant and further investigations or avoidance were recommended (Lawrence
2007). Since site 41WM1028 could not be avoided by
the proposed Arterial A alignment, a strategy for testing
the site was developed to gather additional information
regarding the signiﬁcance of the cultural deposits.
SWCA began test excavations at the 41WM1028 project area on August 6, 2007. An arbitrary vertical datum
with an elevation of 100 m was established at the site
(the actual surface elevation is approximately 715 feet
above sea level). Although an excavation grid was not
established, the horizontal data for the investigations
were mapped with a GPS unit. SWCA’s test investigations at 41WM1028 consisted of two interrelated and
concurrent activities. The ﬁrst phase of investigation

began with backhoe trench excavations in select areas
along the APE through the site. The second phase consisted of several hand excavated test units positioned
along select backhoe trenches on 41WM1028. Backhoe
trenches and test units were designated by number (assigned sequentially) (Figure 5.1).

BACKHOE TRENCH EXCAVATION
Initially, seven trenches (B1–7) were systematically
placed and excavated in various site locations to examine the site stratigraphy and presence of cultural
materials (Figure 5.1). An additional two trenches (B8
and B9) where excavated near the end of the site testing
to verify site stratigraphy. All of the backhoe trenches
were as closely aligned to 357 degrees as possible,
which parallels the survey corridor (Figure 5.2). The
intervals of the trench placement were tighter at the
northern end of the trench and as excavations moved
southward the spacing between the trenches increased
(Figure 5.2).
The depth of these nine backhoe trenches (B1–B9)
ranged from 67–190 cmbs (Table 5.1). With some
exceptions, the general stratigraphy observed in the
trenches consisted of an upper stratum of black to very
dark grayish-brown (10YR2/1–3/2) clay loam with
common snail shell fragments, small scattered gravels,
and abundant roots (Table 5.1). The upper stratum
appeared to be a disturbed zone possibly from plowing and the lower boundary ranged from clear to very
diffuse. Below this stratum lay a brown to yellowishbrown (10YR4/3–5/4) silt loam with some clay content
and some scattered rounded limestone gravels with a
very diffuse lower boundary that was wavy in a few
locations (Table 5.1). The third stratum consisted of a
brownish-yellow to yellowish-brown (10YR6/6–5/4)
silt with some rare snail shell fragments and occasional
inclusions of very pale brown (10YR7/3) chalk like
material. The lower boundary for the third stratum
varies from clear to gradual depending on the trench.

Site map of 41WM1028.

At the northern end of the site, the lower boundary
was typically clear while as the excavations explored
southward, the lower boundary became more gradual
(Table 5.1). Underlying this stratum was the fourth
stratum that consisted of a very pale brown to brownish-yellow (10YR7/4–6/6) silt that has some CaCO³
pebbles and chalk that increases in frequency with
depth (Table 5.1). The lower boundary of the fourth
stratum was clear and smooth, overlaying the ﬁfth
stratum, which was the bottom stratum in most of
the trenches. The ﬁfth stratum consisted of very pale
brown (10YR8/3–8/2) silty clay that contains small
subrounded limestone gravels. The clay content in
the ﬁfth stratum increased with depth (Table 5.1).
There were some exceptions to the previously
described trench stratigraphy. Speciﬁcally, B1 at
the edge of the upland ridge and the trenches (B4,
B7, and B9) along the western margin of the APE
exhibited a slightly different proﬁle. Trench B1 was
very unique in comparison to the rest of the site
stratigraphy. This trench contained an upper stratum
of brown (7.5YR5/4) clay loam with abundant roots

and occasional gravels with an abrupt lower boundary (Table 5.1). Below this stratum lay a stratum of
white (7.5YR8/1) silt loam with common roots and
some occasional gravels and snail shell fragments
with a clear to abrupt lower boundary. The third
stratum consisted of a reddish-brown (7.5YR6/8)
clay loam with evidence of bioturbation from roots
that have been ﬁlled in with soil from the overlying
stratum. The lower boundary of the third stratum
was indistinct to gradual. The fourth stratum was the
basal stratum of B1 that consisted of reddish-brown
(7.5YR6/8) clay loam to clay that increased in clay
content with depth (Table 5.1). The trenches (B4,
B7 and B9) along the western margins of the APE
generally exhibited a surface stratum of brown to
very dark grayish-brown (10YR4/3–3/2) clay loam
with abundant gravels and roots with an abrupt lower
boundary. Below this soil horizon lay a stratum of
yellowish-brown to grayish-brown (10YR5/4–5/2)
silty clay loam with small CaCO³ pieces that increased in frequency with depth. The lower boundary of the second stratum was abrupt with a wavy
topography. The third stratum was the basal horizon

of these trenches and consisted of very pale brown
to pale brown (10YR8/3–6/3) clay loam-clay with
abundant CaCO³ pieces and degrading bedrock
(Table 5.1).
Regarding cultural materials, trenches B1, B4, B6,
and B9 did not contain cultural materials in the examined proﬁles. All of the remaining trenches (B2, B3,
B5, B7, and B8) contained some evidence of cultural
materials. Trench B2 contained some ﬁre-cracked
rock and scattered debitage in the west proﬁle at the
northern end of the trench (Figure 5.3). Also, during
the excavation of B2 a projectile point (PP1) was
observed in the backdirt that appeared to suggest an
Early Archaic temporal afﬁliation. This artifact is
discussed in the following chapter, but brieﬂy it is the
proximal midsection portion of a lanceolate shaped
projectile point with a slightly contracting stem, a
concave base that exhibits extensive edge grinding,
and long, parallel ﬂaking across the body. The distal
tip is missing, with extensive facial damage in the
area of the break possibly indicating a strong impact
caused the break. This stemmed, lanceolate point is
morphologically similar to an Early Stemmed Lanceolate, which is associated with the Early Archaic.
This artifact was recovered somewhere between
the surface and 60 cmbs at the southern end of B2.
About 20 m south of B2, the proﬁle of B3 contained

Figure 5.3.

Proﬁle of B2 west wall.

a cluster of fractured limestone some of which were
thermally altered. This cluster of limestone (n=4)
was observed in the west wall at the northern end
of the trench (Figure 5.4). The proﬁle of B5, about
50 m south of B3, contained two pieces of burned
rock. The thermally altered limestone was observed
in the western proﬁle of the trench at about 20 cmbs.
No debitage was observed in this proﬁle. Trench
B7 contained a shallowly buried cluster of burned
rock (Figure 5.2). Approximately 15 pieces of ﬁrecracked rock was observed at the southern end of B7
beginning at about 20 cmbs. The ﬁnal trench (B8) is
about 25 m north of B4 and contained some sparse
debitage and thermally altered rock (n=2) between
30–50 cmbs in the eastern proﬁle at the north end
of the trench.
Each occurrence of cultural materials in the trenches
was examined to determine if they warranted further
investigation with hand excavations (Test Units).
With the exception of the cultural materials in B8,
all were considered to merit additional evaluation.
The materials in B8, upon inspection, represented
the remains of a possible feature. Unfortunately, the
excavation of the trench removed all but a few ﬁrecracked rock fragments. The backdirt pile did contain
additional thermally-altered limestone fragments,
but no charcoal, faunal remains, or lithic artifacts.

Therefore, the burned rock phenomenon in B8 was
considered to be completely demolished and not
worthy of further work.

HAND EXCAVATION
Upon completion of the backhoe trenching, SWCA
began the hand excavated test units. A total of ﬁve
test units (TUs 1–5) was placed along the trenches
containing cultural materials. Test Units 1 and 2 were
placed on B2, TU3 was positioned along B3, TU4
was placed on B7, and TU5 was positioned along B5
(Figure 5.2). Each of the ﬁve test units were placed to
slightly overlap the wall of the backhoe trench. The
results of the test units are discussed below.

TEST UNIT 1
Test Unit 1 is one of the northernmost units on
41WM1028 intended to assess the extent and nature of the burned rock in the western proﬁle of B2
(Figure 5.3). The unit was established along the
western wall and was placed over the feature at the
northern end. A string line datum was established
south of TU1 along the western side of the trench at
an elevation of 99.40 m, roughly 16 cm above the
ground surface. The ﬁrst level was slightly sloped,
and excavation in the unit began at 99.26 m (14

cmbd). A total of nine levels was excavated, reaching
a bottom depth of 98.30 m (110 cmbd).
The stratigraphy of TU1 was similar to that observed
in most of the trenches on the site. Speciﬁcally, the
upper stratum consisted of a dark clay loam with
scattered snail shell fragments and gravels, which appeared to be disturbed possibly from plowing (Figure
5.5). This stratum gradually transitioned into a lighter
silt loam containing some clay content and scattered
rounded limestone gravels. This transitioned very
gradually with an irregular to wavy lower boundary
into the underlying stratum (Figure 5.6). This consisted of very light colored silt with some rare snail
shell fragments and occasional inclusions of a chalk
like material and CaCO³ pieces. This stratum clearly
transitioned into the silt and white chalk of the fourth
stratum of TU1 that, with depth, had an increasing
amount of CaCO³ (Figure 5.5). Excavation in TU1
ceased within the fourth stratum.
Cultural materials in TU1 were present in all
levels including the bottom level (Level 9) from
98.40–98.30. However, the cultural materials within
a portion of Level 7 and all of Levels 8 and 9 were
recovered from the matrix of an animal burrow in
the southeast corner of the unit and were interpreted
to be compromised (Figure 5.3). For the remaining
levels, the cultural assemblage was relatively con-

sistent in quantity of artifacts. Although there were
differences between levels, no dramatic ﬂuctuations
in frequency were apparent (Table 5.2). Also, no
predominant stage of lithic reduction was apparent
between unit levels. However, the debitage recovered
from TU1 was all manufactured from a ﬁne-grained
chert, probably locally procured, that exhibited all
stages of reduction. Overall, the chert debitage
of TU1 seems to be primarily represented by the
middle to late stages of biface reduction. Regarding
chipped stone tools, TU1 contained 14 formal tools
(projectile points and various biface fragments) and
11 informal tools (modiﬁed ﬂakes and cores). Formal
chipped stone tools were recovered in Levels 1, 3–7
with Level 5 (98.80–98.70 m) containing the most
(n=4). The informal tools in TU1 were recovered
from Levels 4–8 with Levels 4, 5, and 7 containing
the most (n=3). The projectile points of this unit were
encountered in Level 1 (Bulverde and Pedernales),
Level 3 (Pedernales), and Level 4 (Pedernales).
Regarding ﬁre-cracked rock in TU1, there were some
apparent ﬂuctuations in the excavated levels (Table
5.3). Level 5 had the most thermally altered rock
fragments followed by Levels 6 and 3 (Table 5.3).
The remaining levels were relatively consistent for
quantity of ﬁre-cracked rock fragments. During the
excavation of TU1, no evidence of patterning was
observed to suggest the presence of an intact thermal

The second unit (TU2) was also placed
along B2, about 3 m south of TU1 on
the eastern wall of the trench (Figure
5.3). The placement of TU2 was in the
vicinity of where artifact PP 1 originated and was intended to determine if
artifacts similar to PP 1 were present.
The ﬁrst level was slightly sloped, and
excavation in the unit began at 99.40
m, which was equivalent to the trench
datum elevation. A total of nine levels
was excavated, reaching a bottom depth
of 98.40 m, (100 cmbd).

The stratigraphy of TU2 was consistent
with that encountered in TU1, which was similar
to that observed in most of the trenches on the site.
Brieﬂy, the stratigraphy observed in TU2 was almost
exactly the same as that in TU1 (Figure 5.7). However, the third stratum containing scattered CaCO³
pieces was encountered at a shallower depth (i.e.,
98.80), which is about 10–15 cm shallower than in
TU1 (Figure 5.7). As in TU1, the excavation of TU2
ceased upon encountering the fourth stratum that
contained silt with chalky materials and increasing
amounts of CaCO³.
Another distinction between TU1 and TU2 is observed within the recovered materials. Speciﬁcally,
TU2 is similar to TU1 in that the recovered lithic
debitage exhibited all stages of reduction with a
slight predominance of middle to late stage ﬂakes
represented. However, in contrast to TU1, there is
a level that is demonstrably higher in quantity that
the other levels. Speciﬁcally, Level 3 (99.10–99.00)
contained almost twice the amount of any of the other
levels in this test unit (Table 5.2). Unfortunately, this
level of higher quantities of lithic debitage is within
the upper stratum of disturbed clay loam (Figure
5.7). Regarding chipped stone tools, TU2 contained
six formal tools (projectile point fragments) and two
informal tools (modiﬁed ﬂakes and indeterminate).
The chipped stone tool frequency observed in TU2

consisted of formal tools recovered in Level 1 (Alba/
Edwards and untyped distal tip), Level 2 (stem/tang
possible Perdiz/Bonham), and Level 3 (drill tip and
possible Marcos base).
As with the higher quantities of lithic debitage in
Level 3 of TU2, there is also a noticeably higher
amount of thermally altered rock at this depth (Table
5.3). By weight, Level 3 contains roughly three times
the amount than that of the next highest level (i.e.,
Level 1) (Table 5.3). As previously mentioned, the
depth of this elevated amount of ﬁre-cracked rocks
is within the upper stratum of disturbed clay loam
(Figure 5.7). The remaining levels that contained ﬁrecracked rock were relatively consistent for quantity.
No thermally altered rock was observed in TU2 from
Level 5 to the base of the unit in Level 9.

The third unit (TU3) was positioned along B3, which
is about 20 m south of B2 (Figure 5.2). This unit was
placed on the western wall at the northern end of the
trench over a cluster of thermally altered rock (Figure
5.4). A string line datum was established south of
TU3 along the western side of B3 at an elevation of
100 m, roughly 10 cm above the ground surface. The
ﬁrst level was slightly undulating and excavation in
the unit began at 99.90 m, (10 cmbd). A total of six
levels was excavated, reaching a bottom depth of
99.30 m, (70 cmbd).
The stratigraphy of TU3 was very similar to that
encountered in TUs 1 and 2 the excavation of TU3
ceased upon encountering the deeper silt with abundant CaCO³ ﬁlaments and pieces.
The recovered cultural materials in TU3 were present
in all levels. The quantity of lithic debitage in TU3

was much lower in comparison to the recovery in
TU1 and TU2, but increased in amount with depth
(Table 5.2). However, due to the abundant CaCO³
filaments and pieces in the stratum, excavation
ceased. Furthermore, as this unit was a feature focus
unit targeting an identiﬁed feature (i.e., Feature 2) excavations ceased upon completion of the level below
the feature. No predominant stage of lithic reduction
was evident when comparing the debitage between
TU3 levels, but the majority of the ﬂakes (90 percent)
exhibited some level of patination from Levels 4–6.
Regarding chipped stone tools, TU3 contained two
formal tools (various biface fragments) and two
informal tools (utilized ﬂakes). The chipped stone
tool frequency observed in TU3 solely consisted of
a formal tool in Level 1 (biface fragment) and Level

3 (distal tip of possible point) and two informal tools
recovered in Level 5 (utilized ﬂakes).
Regarding fire-cracked rock in TU3, there is a
dramatic ﬂuctuation in amounts within the excavated levels (Table 5.3). Speciﬁcally, Levels 4 and
5 contained almost all of the thermally altered rock
observed in TU3. This dramatic increase in ﬁrecracked rock was not unexpected as it correlated
to the cluster of burned rock observed in the trench
proﬁle that compelled the placement of TU3 (Figure
5.4). This cluster of ﬁre-cracked rock was identiﬁed
as a feature during excavation (Feature 2), which is
discussed in the following chapter. For the remaining
levels of TU3, only minimal amounts of burned rock
were observed in these levels.

TEST UNIT 4
Test Unit 4 was positioned along B7, which is about
12 m west of B2 (Figure 5.2). This unit was placed
along the western wall at the southern end of the
trench over an identiﬁed cluster of thermally altered
rock in the trench proﬁle. A string line datum was
established north of TU4 along the western side of
B7 at an elevation of 99 m, roughly 34 cm above the
ground surface. The ﬁrst level was slightly undulating and excavation in the unit began at 98.66 m, (34
cmbd). A total of two levels was excavated, reaching
a bottom depth of 98.40 m, (60 cmbd).
The stratigraphy of TU4 was slightly different from
that observed in the other test units. The upper stratum consisted of the same dark clay loam observed
across the site, but the soil appeared to be very disturbed from roots and possibly vehicular trafﬁc and
included common pieces of chalky material within

the matrix (Figure 5.8). The chalky material is similar
to that observed in the third stratum of B7. It appears
that the chalky material may have been translocated
by abundant tree roots. The excavation ceased in TU4
as the third stratum was being encountered.
The recovered cultural materials in TU4 were present in all excavated levels of the unit. The quantity
of lithic debitage in TU4 was relatively consistent
in quantity, but was slightly lower compared to the
recovery in Test Units 1 and 2 located roughly 12
m away (Table 5.2). No predominant stage of lithic
reduction was evident when comparing the debitage
between levels, but some evidence of thermally altered ﬂakes were present and a majority of the ﬂakes
(80 percent) exhibited some level of patination in

In TU4 the amounts of ﬁre-cracked rock increased
with depth (Table 5.3). Beginning at the base of
Level 1 and into Level 2 almost all of the thermally
altered rock was encountered for TU4. Of note, this
cluster of burned rock was not unexpected as it was
observed during the investigation of B7. The cluster
of ﬁre-cracked rock was identiﬁed as a feature during excavation and designated Feature 1, which is
discussed in the following chapter. No
additional levels were excavated after
the investigation of Feature 1.

encountered.

The stratigraphy of TU5 contained the
upper stratum of the disturbed dark
clay loam observed across the site. This
stratum encompassed the ﬁrst two excavation levels, which then transitioned
into a lighter brown clay loam with
ﬁlaments of CaCO³ dispersed through
the third and into the fourth excavation
levels. Near the base of the excavations,
the soil consisted of a brown clay loam
with increasing amounts of CaCO³
pieces and small nodules (Figure 5.9).
The excavation ceased in TU5 as the

Cultural materials were recovered in all excavated
levels of TU5. The quantity of lithic debitage in TU5
was much lower in comparison to the recovery in the
other units at the site, but did show an increase in
amount with depth (Table 5.2). However, due to the
abundant CaCO³ pieces in the stratum, excavation
ceased. No predominant stage of lithic reduction was
observed in this test unit, but there was a signiﬁcant
amount of shatter and thermally altered ﬂakes present. Furthermore, a majority of the debitage in this

The last test unit (TU5) was positioned
along B5, which is about 50 m south
of B5 at the southern end of the site
(Figure 5.2). This unit was placed
along the western wall at the northern
end of the trench above a small cluster
of thermally altered rock in the trench
proﬁle. A string line datum was established south of TU5 along the western
side of B5 at an elevation of 100.80
m, roughly 23 cm above the ground
surface. Excavation began in the unit

unit exhibited some patination in Levels 2–4. The
chipped stone tool frequency observed in TU5 was
very sparse, consisting of one modiﬁed ﬂake in Level
4 (100.30–100.20).
The ﬁre-cracked rock amounts in TU5 are consistent,
but very low in quantity (Table 5.3). The quantity of
thermally altered rock in this test unit is minuscule
in comparison to the other test units on the site. The
burned rock was randomly scattered with no apparent patterning or intentional placement. Therefore,
the ﬁre-cracked rock observed in TU5 may, in effect,
be the result of horizontal movement, possibly by
the disturbance (e.g., plowing) that has affected the
upper soil horizon.

CULTURAL FEATURES AND RECOVERED MATERIALS
John Lowe, Mercedes C. Cody, and Ken Lawrence

INTRODUCTION
This chapter summarizes the cultural features and
recovered materials encountered during SWCA test
excavations conducted at site 41WM1028. Each category is individually discussed below beginning with
a discussion of the cultural features followed by a
discussion of the recovered materials.

body of Feature 1, which consisted of a disorganized
scatter of burned rock clustered at the eastern edge of
the unit (Figure 6.1). The western half of the unit did
contain some scattered limestone rock, but no thermally-altered rock fragments. A few scattered burned rocks
of Feature 1 extended to depths that would correspond
to Level 3 (98.40–98.30), but this and subsequent levels
were not excavated.

DESCRIPTION

CULTURAL FEATURES
Evidence of several cultural features was encountered
during the investigations of site 41WM1028. Varying
amounts of burned rock were observed in the proﬁles
of B2, B3, B5, B7, and B8. Upon further examination
in each of these locations, only the burned rock in B7
and B3 warranted feature designation (i.e., Features 1
and 2, respectively). The burned rock in the remaining
trenches was either determined to be randomly scattered and diffuse in nature or widely distributed through
post-depositional processes (e.g., plowing).

Feature 1 is a loose, disorganized scatter of burned
rocks, including some non-burned limestone cobbles,
with no discernible pattern. The burned rocks were situated within a matrix of soil undifferentiated from the
surrounding matrix with no evidence of in situ burning.
The limestone rocks composing the feature were highly
fragmented and rarely observed to be overlapping. Of
the 61 burned rocks, roughly 75 percent were rounded
and 25 percent were angular in shape and between 0–10
cm in size. The burned rocks were situated adjacent
to each other in an irregular oval shape (Figure 6.1).

FEATURE 1
During the excavation of B7 a scatter of
heavily fragmented burned rock was observed at the southern end of the trench in
the western proﬁle. The thermally altered
rock was situated about 20 cm below the
ground surface within the upper dark clay
loam stratum. To investigate this phenomenon a test unit (TU 4) was placed above
the cluster of burned rock and excavated.
Within the ﬁrst level (98.64–98.50), some
burned rock was encountered along the
margins of the trench wall, but Level 1 also
contained an abundant amount of unburned
limestone cobbles. The second excavated
level (98.50–98.40) contained the main

hearth cleaning episode, but the initial location of
the thermal event that created the burned rocks of
Feature 1 is unknown.

All Feature 1 matrix was screened and with the exception of the lateral margin of a possible projectile
point, no notable artifacts were recovered. The artifact frequencies of the feature matrix compared to
the non-feature matrix of TU 4 appears to be similar
(see Table 5.2). No carbon pieces or ﬂecking were
observed in Feature 1 and no special samples were
collected.

FEATURE 2

An indeterminate portion of Feature 1 was removed
during the excavation of B7, but at least half of
the feature remained. However, the matrix of this
remaining portion of Feature 1 has been severely affected by bioturbation from roots. The root growth in
the area was extensive and impacted the area within
and around the cluster of burned rocks composing
Feature 1.

INTERPRETATION AND CHRONOLOGY
There was no charcoal observed within Feature
1. As such, no radiocarbon dates are available for
this feature. Additionally, no temporally diagnostic
artifacts were encountered within or in
association with the cluster of burned
rock. The soil stratum containing the
feature is interpreted to be disturbed.
Similarly, based on temporally diagnostic artifacts from other trenches (i.e.,
B2) the upper dark clay loam stratum is
interpreted to be a palimpsest containing materials dating from the Middle
Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods.
Furthermore, the extensive root growth
has severely impacted the cluster of
burned rock. The loose and irregular
orientation of the limestone rock may
be attributed to this bioturbation. Based
on all these reasons, an interpretative
function can not be confidently assigned to Feature 1. This feature may
represent the location of a secondary
disposal location of burned rock or a Figure 6.2.

During the excavation of B3 a small cluster of burned
rock was observed at the northern end of the trench
in the western proﬁle. The thermally altered rock was
located about 40 cmbs. This small cluster of rock was
situated near the base of the upper dark clay loam
stratum within a transitional zone between the ﬁrst
and second stratums (see Figure 5.4). To investigate this phenomenon a test unit (TU 3) was placed
above the cluster of burned rock and excavated.
At the beginning of the ﬁfth level (98.50–98.40),
some burned rock was encountered near the center
of the unit and along the margins of the B3 proﬁle.
Based on the presence of a cluster of burned rock in
a relatively limited area, the phenomenon was designated Feature 2 and feature investigations began
(Figure 6.2).

DESCRIPTION
Feature 2 is a conglomeration of burned rocks situated in an amorphous shaped pattern. The main body

of the feature is surrounded by a periphery of more
burned rocks (Figure 6.3). The soil matrix within the
burned rocks was undifferentiated from the surrounding matrix with no evidence of in situ burning or
staining. The limestone rocks composing the feature
were highly fragmented and about half of the rocks
were observed to be overlapping.
Of the 87 burned rocks composing the feature,
roughly 67 percent were angular in shape and
between 0–10 cm in size and roughly 70 percent
appeared to be fractured in situ. The burned rocks
were situated adjacent to each other in an irregular
oval shape (Figure 6.3). Dimensionally, the cluster
of rock extends about 90 cm east-west (truncated
by trench) and about 70 cm north-south, with a
maximum thickness of 10 cm (99.49–99.39). In
cross section, Feature 2 demonstrated an irregular
basal conﬁguration resting on a ﬂat surface with no
formal basin observed.
Most of the Feature 2 matrix was screened except
for one matrix special sample collected from around
the burned rocks. The debitage for the feature matrix was tallied (n=25) and incorporated into the
recovered debitage for Level 5 (see Table 5.2). The
artifact frequencies of the feature matrix compared
to the non-feature matrix of TU 3 appears to be
similar (see Table 5.2). Of note, the vast majority
of the recovered debitage in and around Feature 2
exhibited heavy patination, which suggests extensive
surface exposure.

INTERPRETATION AND CHRONOLOGY
There was only one ﬂeck of charcoal observed within
Feature 2, which was insufﬁcient for obtaining a
viable sample. Therefore no radiocarbon dates are
available for this feature. Furthermore, no temporally
diagnostic artifacts were recovered within or near
Feature 2. Thus, the cultural context and age for
Feature 2 is unknown. The dark clay loam stratum
partially containing Feature 2 is interpreted to be
disturbed. Additionally, comparing temporally diagnostic artifacts from other trenches (i.e., B2), the
upper dark clay loam stratum is interpreted to be a
jumbled palimpsest containing materials dating from
the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods. Based
on the orientation and coherence of the apparently ‘in
situ’ burned rocks, Feature 2 appears to represent the
primary location of a thermal hearth feature. Also,
the absence of thermally altered soil and paucity of
carbon suggests that the feature may have been a
low-energy thermal feature. Furthermore, the high
percentage of debitage exhibiting some level of
patination within a stratum that is interpreted to be a
palimpsest suggests that this feature was exposed on
the surface for a considerable amount of time. The
extent of the negative effects that have acted upon
the feature (e.g., duration of surface exposure, roots,
and plowing) is unknown.

An indeterminate portion of Feature
2 was removed during the excavation
of B3, but at least 75 percent of the
feature appeared intact. The matrix of
the remaining portion of Feature 2 has
been heavily affected by bioturbation
as evidenced by roots, worm casts, and
numerous inclusions. The bioturbation
observed was particularly evident in the
level preceding the feature and in the
feature level (i.e., Level 4 and 5). The
disturbance from root growth may account for the periphery of burned rock
that surrounds Feature 2 (Figure 6.4).

varied, as two of the cores display
multidirectional scars. The other two
exhibit bifacial reduction sequences
and the largest of these could have been
used as a chopping tool. The ﬁfth core is
a small fragment of a ﬁne-grained very
dark grey chert raw material, similar in
appearance to the Round Rock variety
of Edwards Chert. The specimen has a
ﬂat, slightly weathered cortical section
and multidirectional reduction scars.
The distribution of the cores suggests
that the area near TU 1 was used for
lithic reduction.

Figure 6.4.

Test Unit 1 also accounted for ﬁve of
the 11 total ﬂake tools recovered from
41WM1028, and four of the six edgemodiﬁed ﬂakes. These ﬂakes have evidence of retouching along at least one lateral margin.
These specimens lack polish from use and display
only slight evidence of usewear overall. The rest of
the assemblage consists of utilized ﬂakes, displaying evidence of edge-wear or use marks but lacking
retouch scars. Secondary ﬂakes account for ﬁve of
these tools, while ﬁve more are made on bifacethinning ﬂakes. A single modiﬁed ﬂake was made
on a blade-like tertiary ﬂake, and two of the bifacethinning ﬂakes also had a blade-like morphology. A
number of chert types are evident in the assemblage,
including two specimens of the aforementioned
Round Rock variety, but heavy patination hampered
identiﬁcation on several of the ﬂakes. The modiﬁed
ﬂake recovered from Level 7 (98.60–98.50) of TU
1 is of the same material as the cores from that level
(Table 6.1).

RECOVERED MATERIALS
This section of the chapter describes the cultural
materials artifacts recovered during the test excavations in the ﬁve test units and nine backhoe trenches
at 41WM1028. The discussion of the site’s artifact
assemblage is grouped into various categories, all of
which are prehistoric.

PREHISTORIC STONE ARTIFACTS
A total of 46 chipped stone tools were recovered
during the test excavations at 41WM1028. Of these,
18 were informal tools, such as cores, edge-modiﬁed
ﬂakes, and unifaces. The remaining chipped stone
tools were categorized as formal tools that include
bifaces and projectile points. The informal tools are
cataloged in Table 6.1 while Table 6.2 summarizes
data regarding the formal tools recovered during test
excavations.

INFORMAL TOOLS
All ﬁve of the cores found at 41WM1028 came from
TU 1 (Table 6.1). Four of these are from weathered
cobbles of a white (7.5YR8/1) chert. Cortex was
present on all four specimens in limited areas, generally along a ﬂat plane. This possibly suggests that the
cobbles were not obtained from a creek bed, where
gravels are more rounded. Reduction strategies are

A single uniface was recovered from the southwest
portion of TU 1, Level 4 (98.90–98.80). This tool was
made from a large, secondary biface-thinning ﬂake
of very dark grayish-brown (10YR3/2) chert that has
areas of heavy patina. All of the lateral margins have
been retouched; the long, straight margin and the
distal portion are extensively chipped. This variation
suggests that the tool may have had multiple uses,
although only light use-wear is visible. An additional
proximal fragment of an indeterminate tool type,
made of Round Rock variety chert and showing
heavy use damage, came from TU 2 (Table 6.1).

FORMAL TOOLS
The formal tool assemblage recovered at 41WM1028
consists of 16 biface fragments, one complete biface,
and 11 projectile point fragments (Table 6.2). Almost
40 percent of the formal tools were projectile point
fragments; they also account for 24 percent of the
total tool assemblage.

BIFACES
The biface assemblage is characterized mainly by
small fragments of completed or nearly completed
tools. Approximately two-thirds of the collection ﬁt

into Stage 4 or 5 in the biface reduction sequence
described by Andrefsky (2002). A single specimen of
Round Rock variety chert appears to be in the early
stages of reduction and is morphologically similar to
a core fragment. This is also one of two specimens
that appear to be made from a cobble rather than a
ﬂake blank, as many of the fragments have remnant
platforms or bulbs of percussion. Many of the ﬁnished tool specimens display areas of possible use
wear along the margins and fracturing consistent with
use breakage. Likewise, the middle-stage fragments
appear to have been broken during manufacturing
and discarded.

Some patterns are evident in the distribution of the
bifaces across the site. Of the 17 total specimens,
10 were recovered from TU 1 (Table 6.2). Half of
these are from completed tools, including the single
complete biface. Test Units 2 and 3 each contained
a single fragment from a completed tool (Table 6.2).
The ﬁve remaining examples are from TU 4, which
included Feature 1. A small lateral fragment of a medium-grained, light gray chert came from the feature
context. Three of the other four fragments are Stage
3 manufacturing failures, and the fourth appears to
have broken during rejuvenation. It is possible that
a tool manufacturing area may be associated with
Feature 1.
A complete bifacial knife (Figure 6.5d) encountered
in Level 5 (98.80–98.70) of TU 1 is a very unique
specimen (Table 6.2). The artifact is made of a light
gray (5YR7/1) coarse-grained chert or quartzite. The
edges are alternately beveled but not particularly
well ﬂaked, and the middle is poorly thinned. There
is no evidence of use wear or hafting. Considering
the abundance of high-quality chert in the vicinity of
the site as well as the debitage and tool assemblage,

this tool was very likely transported into the area
and onto the site.
The only other unique tool form in the biface assemblage is a drill tip recovered from Level 3 (99.10–
99.00) of TU 2 (Figure 6.5d). The shape, thickness,
and slight beveling distinguish this small fragment as
a drill. It is made from a ﬁne-grained, dark grayishbrown (10YR4/2) Edwards chert with some patina
that has destroyed any traces of use polish. However,
the tip and edges are worn and the fracture pattern
suggests that the tool snapped during use.

PROJECTILE POINTS
The projectile point assemblage from site 41WM1028
(Figures 6.5 a–d and 6.6 a–i) is made up entirely of
fragmentary specimens. Two of the 11 total examples
are ﬁnely ﬂaked distal sections with snap breaks.
Both the edges and tips of these points are still
sharp and do not evidence any damage outside of
the separation fracture.

A possible arrow point stem or tang was recovered
from TU 2, Level 2 (99.20–99.10) (Figure 6.6a). This
artifact is made from a translucent, dark gray ﬁnegrained chert of the Round Rock variety and is very
ﬁnely ﬂaked. The stem/tang is narrow, with parallel
sides and a slightly rounded base. The edges show
some light grinding or possibly haft wear. A small
bit of remnant platform on one of the basal corners
shows that the point was made from a ﬂake blank and
is an apparent arrow point fragment. If this artifact
is a point base and not a tang it is morphologically
similar to the Bonham or Perdiz type stems (Turner
and Hester 1999). Unfortunately, there is not enough
of the artifact remaining to make a conﬁdent identiﬁcation.
The other arrow point from 41WM1028 was recovered from Level 1 (99.40–99.30) of TU 2 (Table 6.6).
This artifact retains the proximal and medial sections
of a corner-notched, slightly expanding stem projectile point that is stylistically similar to an Alba point
(Turner and Hester 1999:200). One side appears to
be slightly serrated, but this could also have been the
result of damage (Figure 6.6c). The point is made
from a dark grayish-brown (10YR4/2) ﬁne-grained
Edwards chert. The distal tip is missing as the result
of an impact that left a slight hinge fracture scar and
broke the point at a diagonal. The Alba projectile
point type is associated with the Late Prehistoric
time period (Turner and Hester 1999:200).
The remaining two projectile points from TU 2 are
dart point fragments (Table 6.2). An expanding stem
point base with an extremely heavy patina (Figure
6.2h) is morphologically similar to a Marcos base,
which dates to the Late and Transitional Archaic
periods (Turner and Hester 1999). The specimen,
from Level 3 (99.10–99.00), has a heavy patina and
has been damaged by potlidding. A heavily patinated
Darl preform (Figure 6.6b), dating to the Transitional
Archaic period, was found in Level 4 (99.00–98.90).
This point has a wide stem and weak shoulders and
would have been rather small and narrow if complete. A long vertical fracture has removed one full
lateral margin of the point, and the distal tip is also
missing. The point is relatively thick and the base
has a ﬂat section, which suggests that the point was
not completed. The lateral section may have been
removed as a burin.

TU 1 yielded parts of three Pedernales points (Table
6.2). The Pedernales point type according to Turner
and Hester (1999) dates to Middle Archaic while Collins (2004) associates this point with the Late Archaic
period. A point base from Level 1 (99.26–99.10) has
the rectangular, bifurcated shape and basal concavity
with thinning ﬂakes characteristic of the Pedernales
type (Figure 6.6g). There is some edge grinding
and slight beveling on the specimen, which is made
from a ﬁne-grained, brown Edwards chert. The stem
fractured from snapping, as there is a hinge scar on
one face.
A large proximal and medial fragment of a Pedernales point was recovered from Level 2 (99.10–99.00)
(Figure 6.6e). The stem has edge grinding and is
slightly beveled, and the tips of the “tail” are damaged. One face of this point has a heavy patina,
while the other has some white spots that may be
inclusions in an otherwise very dark gray (7.5YR3/1)
Edwards chert. The distal and much of the medial
section broke away at a diagonal, likely resulting
from an impact.
A ﬁnal Pedernales base, with an extremely heavy
patina, was found in Level 4 (98.90–98.80) (Table
6.2). This specimen is thinner than the others, is
only very slightly beveled, and has rounded basal
ears (Figure 6.6i). This piece also suffered a snap
fracture, which removed a portion of both faces in
the area of the break.
A nearly complete Bulverde point preform was
uncovered in Level 5 (98.80–98.70) of TU 1 (Table
6.2). The distal tip of the point is missing, likely removed as part of a manufacturing or material failure
(Figure 6.6d). One face has a large knot of a white,
medium-grained chert that may have once been near
the cortex of the raw material. One interesting element of this preform is that one portion of the stem
and adjoining shoulder are essentially ﬁnished, while
the opposing side has only been ﬂaked on one face
and the shoulder has not been formed (Figure 6.6d).
This may provide some insight into the production
sequence of Bulverde manufacturing. This artifact,
like most of the lithic material at 41WM1028, is
heavily patinated. However, a small area of excavation damage shows that the original raw material
color was a dark gray brown, likely Edwards chert.

Cultural Features and Recovered Materials

6-11

According to Turner and Hester (1999:82) the Bulverde point type dates to the Early Archaic while
Collins (2004) associates this point with the Late
Archaic period.

one arrow point fragment, one dart point fragment,
and two indeterminate point fragments while one
dart point (PP-1) was observed during the excavation of B2.

The most distinctive projectile point, PP-1, is an
Early Stemmed Lanceolate dart point, which dates to
the Early Archaic Period, recovered from the backdirt
of B2 at a depth of less than 60 cmbs (Table 6.2).
This stemmed, lanceolate point (Figure 6.6f) has a
contracting stem, a concave base, and extensive edge
grinding. The body shows areas of long, parallel ﬂaking from the left. The distal tip of the point is missing, with extensive facial damage in the area of the
break probably attributable to a strong impact. One
of the lateral margins has been removed as a burin
spall. The artifact is heavily patinated throughout,
although some areas around the distal break look as
though the original raw material was a lighter tan
or white color. There is no clear evidence that this
point was collected and recycled by the later occupants of the site during its use-life. The remaining
lateral margin is still relatively sharp, but the color
and level of patination in this area does not differ
from the body of the point, which still retains the
original parallel ﬂake scars. Typically, when a tool
with heavy patina is rejuvenated, the work area will
be the original color, and any additional patina will
be starting fresh from the original. This dart point
is stylistically similar to quite a few Early Stemmed
Lanceolate points that have been recovered from
other archaeological sites in the area.

Recovery from the B2 area indicates most of the
cultural material is concentrated near the base of
the upper dark clay loam stratum at 99.10–98.90
elevation (see Table 5.2). The artifact frequencies are relatively consistent for the ﬁrst couple of
levels and increase dramatically around the third
excavated level (see Table 5.2). After the rise in
artifact quantities the frequencies steadily decrease
with depth until relative cultural sterility around
the seventh level (98.60–98.50). General cultural
sterility occurs within the third stratum identiﬁed
during backhoe trenching, which consists of brownish-yellow (10YR6/6) silt with pockets of a chalk
like materials and small pieces of CaCo³ scattered
throughout the level.

RECOVERED MATERIALS DISCUSSION
Several archaeological patterns were identified
during the 41WM1028 artifact analysis. The most
prominent pattern is demonstrated in the quantity of
artifacts recovered from TUs 1 and 2. Speciﬁcally,
the highest artifact amounts for the site are along
the eastern edge of the APE, particularly around B2
(see Table 5.2). Furthermore, all of the temporally
diagnostic artifacts came from either B2 or TU 1 and
2 within that trench (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). Although
none of the recovered projectile points are complete
they generally have an intact characteristic (e.g.,
proximal end) implying a typology. Brieﬂy, TU 1
contained four dart point fragments, TU 2 contained

The patination observed on some of the debitage
is also suggestive. High frequencies of debitage
recovered from the test units contained moderate-heavy patination (see Table 5.2). Patination is
generally believed to indicate stable surfaces over
an extended period of time. Basically, if all the
artifacts were patinated then they may be roughly
contemporaneous. However, if the assemblage is
mixed (e.g., some with patination and some without
patination) then the artifacts likely were deposited
at different times. Therefore, artifacts exhibiting
patination can be interpreted to be a palimpsest. This
appears to be the case in TU 1 and 2 where over half
of the debitage exhibit patination beginning around
98.90–98.50 elevation (see Table 5.2). Based upon
the mixed amounts of patination observed on the TU
1 and 2 debitage it appears that the artifacts are not
associated with an isolable component.
The temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered during
the testing also are indicative of a jumbled context.
In TU 1, there are three projectile points associated
with the Middle Archaic (Pedernales) that came
from the ﬁrst stratum of dark clay loam and an Early
Archaic Bulverde point that came from near the
base of the ﬁrst stratum (Table 6.2). In TU 2, a Late
Prehistoric Alba point and a Transitional Archaic
Darl point came from the upper dark clay loam of

6-12

Chapter 6

the ﬁrst stratum (Table 6.2). Therefore, the upper
stratum of the site that contains dark clay loam and
evidence of disturbance has artifacts that temporally
span from the Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric.
Therefore it is interpreted that the upper clay loam
stratum is a disturbed palimpsest. Unfortunately, the
Late Paleoindian point (Early Stemmed Lanceolate)
was recovered from the back dirt during B2 excavation. Thus, this artifact lacks a deﬁnite provenience.
However, it is known that the projectile point was
recovered at less than 60 cmbs. Therefore, the artifact could have originated from either the bottom
of the dark clay loam ﬁrst stratum or the top of the
second stratum.

SYNTHESIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Ken Lawrence

INTRODUCTION
The SWCA testing excavations of 41WM1028 provided data for the determination of the cultural components and interpretation of the site’s stratigraphy.
This chapter summarizes the results of the testing by
discussing the nature of stratigraphy, the distribution
of cultural materials, and the site size. Subsequent to
this review, the natural and cultural stratigraphy will
be correlated to assist in the interpretation of the site’s
integrity and potential data yield to enable the determination of eligibility of 41WM1028.

NATURAL STRATIGRAPHY
Synthesizing the various proﬁles across the site, certain
correlation can be made in the region yield tentative
trends. Stratum 1 is a dark clay loam plow zone roughly
40–50 cm thick. Diagnostic artifacts indicate the unit
is a very gradual cumulic soil that contains 4,000 years
of intermixed diagnostic artifacts.
Based upon the age of the temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered from the ﬁrst stratum of dark clay
loam at 41WM1028, it appears that the soils may be
contemporaneous with Unit II identiﬁed by Abbott
(Brownlow 2003). Unit II was indicated to have the
longest depositional history of those identiﬁed by Abbott and appears to temporally encompass some of the
cultural deposits at the site (Brownlow 2003:185).
The second stratum at 41WM1028, which contained
some cultural materials, consists of brown to yellowish-brown silt loam with some clay content and some
scattered rounded limestone gravels may correlate
with Unit I of Abbott’s investigation. This stratigraphic
unit contains dark yellowish-brown clay loam, loam,
and silty clay over silty gravel that dates to 10960±60
(Brownlow 2003:183–185). Although the investiga-

tions did not recover a temporally diagnostic artifact
from this stratum it is older than the ﬁrst stratum.
The remaining strata observed at 41WM1028 consists
of the third stratum of a brownish-yellow to yellowish-brown silt with a few snail shell fragments and
chalk above the fourth stratum of very pale brown to
brownish-yellow silt with CaCO³ pebbles and chalk
that overlies the ﬁfth stratum of very pale brown silty
clay with small subrounded limestone gravels. None
of the remaining three strata at 41WM1028 appears
to correlate with the stratigraphic investigations at the
Blackland Prairie or Wilson-Leonard sites.

CULTURAL STRATIGRAPHY
Several cultural components, as evident by a range of
diagnostic artifacts, are present at 41WM1028, but for
the most part these are intermixed or compressed in one
or two depositional units with little or no stratigraphic
separation. The projectile points for 41WM1028 are
associated with the Early Archaic, Middle Archaic,
Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric time periods. However, the recovered temporally diagnostic
artifacts were almost exclusively recovered from
the ﬁrst stratum of dark clay loam (see Table 6.2).
The exception is the Early Archaic dart point (Early
Stemmed Lanceolate) which was recovered during
trench excavation of B2.
The vertical distribution of the artifact assemblage for
all of 41WM1028 is based upon amounts of recovered
debitage in the levels of TUs 1 and 2. Speciﬁcally,
the amounts of debitage in TUs 1 and 2 were higher
than the other units on the site. Due to the elevated
amounts of debitage in these two units they have been
interpreted to be a fair representation of the cultural
stratigraphy for the site as a whole. However, the site’s
surface undulates topographically causing some variance in regards to elevations of the units in contrast to

7-2

Chapter 7

the soil strata that covers the site. Speciﬁcally, the
surface level (Level 1) in TU 1 is higher in elevation
than the surface level in some of the other units and
lower than others. To account for these variances,
the cultural stratigraphy is referenced in relation
to the natural stratigraphy observed in the backhoe
trenches, which all the test units share.
Based upon the recovered materials from TUs 1 and
2, the artifact frequencies are generally consistent
for the ﬁrst couple of levels, but increase near the
base of the ﬁrst stratum and the upper portion of the
second stratum (see Table 5.2). Within the second
soil stratum of lighter silt loam the artifact quantities
gradually begin to decrease with depth. Within the
third stratum consisting of brownish-yellow silt with
chalk and small CaCO³ pieces, the cultural materials
in TU 2 decrease to relatively sterile. As discussed
in Chapter 5, an animal burrow at the base of the
second stratum and within the third stratum in TU
1 may have distorted the debitage amounts in these
strata (see Figure 5.3).
Overall, the cultural stratigraphy for 41WM1028
appears to indicate that the cultural materials are
concentrated at the base of the ﬁrst stratum and the
upper portion of the second stratum. Unfortunately,
temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered suggest
these deposits are intermixed or packed together in
the ﬁrst and second strata with no distinct separation. During the SWCA revisit of the site, the survey encountered two soil horizons each appearing
to correlate with the presence of cultural materials
(Lawrence 2007). The survey observed cultural materials that seemed to be associated with a dark clay
loam upper soil horizon (i.e., ﬁrst stratum), while
lower cultural materials appeared to correlate to the
lighter silt loam stratum (i.e., second stratum). The
test excavations at 41WM1028 did not encounter a
noticeable delineation in artifact amounts between
the two strata. Therefore, these strata appear to represent a jumbled palimpsest. Although, the ﬁrst and
second strata contain the most artifacts of the site
(particularly the ﬁrst stratum), it is disorganized and
does not contain an intact cultural horizon that can
be associated with a particular time period.

SITE SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION
Prior to testing, the SWCA revisit of site 41WM1028
determined that the cultural materials of the site were
scattered on the surface along 160 m of the Arterial A
survey corridor (north-south) and extended beyond
the edges of the roughly 37-m wide APE (east-west).
However, the surﬁcial artifacts decreased in frequency toward the southern end of the site while the
highest density of surﬁcial artifacts was observed at
the northern end, at the edge of the ridge top. Similarly, the subsurface investigations determined that
the artifact assemblage was densest at the northern
end of the site and decreased in frequency as investigations shifted south and westward.
The test excavations at 41WM1028 appear to indicate
that the site size is consistent with that interpreted
during the SWCA survey revisit. The investigations
did determine that the highest frequency of cultural
materials occurred along the eastern margin of the
survey corridor, particularly in the area of B2. In
contrast, the artifact assemblage along the western
margins of the site is present, but dramatically
decreases moving to the west. Horizontally, site
41WM1028 does appear to extend beyond the edges
of the examined corridor, but not much farther to
the west and appears to increase farther to the east.
Therefore, the main body of the site appears to lie
to the east of the examined corridor, which is closer
to the location initially recorded in 2002 by Sergio
Iruegas mentioned in Chapter 3.

RESEARCH ISSUE 1: INTEGRITY OF THE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL DEPOSITS
Integrity of its archaeological deposits is a primary
consideration in determining the signiﬁcance of site
41WM1028. Based upon the results of the test excavation of 41WM1028 (within the limits of the APE)
it appears that the vertical integrity of 41WM1028
is compressed and intermixed. Specifically, the
ﬁrst stratum of dark clay loam contains most of the
temporally diagnostic artifacts spanning from the
Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. Furthermore, this upper clay loam horizon seems to have
been disturbed possibly from plowing or vegetation
removal. Similarly, the horizontal integrity for the

Synthesis and Recommendations
site appears to be compromised possibly from erosion. The cultural deposits become gradually more
diffuse and sporadic as the investigations move to the
west and south. Thus, in regard to the site within the
APE corridor, the horizontal integrity is degraded.
However, the area outside of the APE to the east
may be intact.
Additionally, another goal for the testing of
41WM1028 was to examine the upland stratigraphy
and compare it to the stratigraphy of other areas along
Brushy Creek. The ﬁrst stratum of dark clay loam
appears to correlate temporally with Unit II identiﬁed
by Abbott (2003). Additionally, the second stratum
at 41WM1028 may correlate with Unit I identiﬁed
by Abbott (2003).

RESEARCH ISSUE 2: POTENTIAL DATA
YIELD
A secondary factor in determining the signiﬁcance
of the site is the potential for additional excavations
to recover meaningful data on regional prehistory.
Prior to testing, SWCA proposed several general
questions pertaining to the site size, function, and
chronology.
The size of 41WM1028 has been determined to
extend beyond the limits of the APE corridor. Although the artifact frequencies decrease to the west
and south, they appear to increase toward the east.
It has been concluded that the main portion of the
site probably lies to the east of the project corridor,
as currently aligned.
Regarding site function, it appears that the site
served as a prehistoric campsite with various lithic
reduction activities. Unfortunately, due to the mixed
debitage assemblage, a determination of which time
period conducted what lithic reduction and retooling
activities is uncertain. However, the fact that all of
the temporally diagnostic artifacts were proximal
fragments suggests that retooling activities occurred
at all times.
Finally, the chronology for 41WM1028 is broad.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts represent time periods from the Late Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric.

7-3

Unfortunately, most of the projectile points were
recovered from the upper clay loam stratum. Therefore, no isolable cultural component can be identiﬁed
with the current data. Of note, three out of the seven
identiﬁed projectile points were Pedernales points
associated with the Middle to Late Archaic (Collins
2004; Turner and Hester 1999:171). This may suggest that the site was repeatedly or primarily used
during the Middle to Late Archaic. Admittedly, this
may also indicate that the site population was greater
than the other temporal periods, etc. An interpretation
can not be made with the current data.
Therefore, the potential data yield for site 41WM1028
within the APE corridor is low. Due to the compromised integrity of the cultural deposits within the
APE, additional excavations have little potential for
gathering new information. However, the area to the
east of the APE within this site does appear to have
better potential for providing new data.

EVALUATING SIGNIFICANCE
SWCA proposed that for the site to found signiﬁcant
under SAL criteria, the deposits must demonstrate
sufﬁcient integrity and data yield potential to address
speciﬁc, detailed research questions that would contribute to the understanding of the regional prehistory within the framework of one or more historic
contexts. For example, if the site had good integrity
but a stratigraphically dispersed, low density of artifacts, no dateable materials, no features, and poor
preservation of organics, it would be less likely to
contribute new or important information. Similarly,
if the site had abundant artifacts and materials but
poor archaeological integrity, eligibility would be
contraindicated. In either case, the eligibility will
hinge on its ability to address one or more explicit,
non-trivial questions about prehistory. The test
excavations of 41WM1028 determined that the
site does have abundant artifacts and has a broad
temporal range. However, the assemblage within
the APE corridor has a poor archaeological integrity.
Therefore, SWCA does not consider 41WM1028 as
signiﬁcant, and no further work within the APE corridor is recommended. However, if work extends to
the east beyond the currently aligned APE corridor
then further work is recommended. This portion of

7-4

Chapter 7

the site does appear to have potential to have horizontal and possibly vertical integrity, which would
warrant additional investigations.
