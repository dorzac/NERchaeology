PANHANDLE ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
Minutes of February 19, 2020
The meeting was called to order by President Erin Frigo shortly after 7 pm in the Amarillo Downtown Library.
There were 20 persons in attendance.
PROGRAM: Speaker for the evening was Dr. Veronica Arias, Curator of Anthropology and Natural History at
PPHM, and past PAS President. The presentation topic was: “A Brief Review of Archeological Work Conducted
at Palo Duro Canyon State Park.”
Part I of the presentation was a Review of Archeological Projects from 1933-2018. Major segments in this period were: 1930’s & 40’s (early Archeological work, including projects with CCC crew labor), 1950’s – 70’s
(“Outdoor Classroom” era, with the arrival of Dr. Jack Hughes), 1980’s – 2000’s (CRM & Permitted Projects –
especially the Hughes sites Resurvey Project and the Red River Wars Project), 2010’s – 2018 (Park Expansion &
Compliance focus). PDCSP has grown to the current size of 27,128 acres, and now hosts over 400,000 visitors
annually.
Part II of the presentation was a recap of the June, 2019 Field School - a joint project of TPWD and the Texas
Archeological Society. 347 Participants were registered for this event, which had a primary focus of pedestrian
field surveys to identify new Archeological sites within the Park. In addition, excavations were conducted at 6
sites: 4 Prehistoric (within the Park), 1 Prehistoric (on private property adjacent to the Park), 1 Historic, and 1
Salvage project. Other related projects included: an Ethnobotanical survey, a GeoArcheology study of the Park
landforms, and a relocation of previously recorded Tecovas flint outcrops. Publications are pending for all this
Field School work, and will appear in due time.
MINUTES: The minutes of the January, 2020 PAS Meeting were approved as published in the PASTIMES
Newsletter.
TREASURER’S REPORT: Treasurer Pam Allison reported an account balance of $7356.37.
PUBLICATIONS REPORT: On behalf of Rolla Shaller, Andy Burcham reported ending January, 2020 balances of $2,379.16 in the Money Market Account, and $5,239.20 in the Certificate of Deposit. The 180 day CD
will mature and renew in February.
OLD BUSINESS:
Erin followed up on the February PASTIMES article to cultivate ideas and activities to grow our PAS organization. Idea & Activity sheets were collected from several members for discussion.
The following items were mentioned as ways to increase the visibility of PAS:
Have a PAS booth/demonstrations at the Earth Day celebration at Wildcat Bluff on April 25
Have a PAS booth at the event in Sunset Center on April 25
Have a PAS booth at the Garden Fest event at Amarillo Botanical Gardens on April 18
Have a PAS booth at the summertime Polk Street Farmer’s Market
Chris Podzemny mentioned that qualified Cultural Resource Monitors are needed during trail building events at
Cross Bar Ranch and Paloduro Canyon State Park (this could be a good fit for PAS members)
Erin mentioned that custom PAS Tee-shirts or Hoodies could be printed up for our members
Discussions to refine the Ideas & Activities list will continue in future meetings. Erin encouraged all members to
continue sending in their ideas.
Paul Katz spoke about the upcoming 56th Symposium of the Southwest Federation of Archaeological Societies,
which will be hosted by PAS on April 4 at PPHM. Preparations are well underway, but Paul requested help from
the PAS membership with several remaining tasks. A task list handout was distributed, and members could sign
up to help. Plans for hosting the SWFAS Symposium will be finalized at the next PAS meeting.
NEW BUSINESS: No items of new business were raised.
ANNOUNCEMENTS: Veronica reported that Alvin Lynn received the Curtis D. Tunnell Lifetime Achievement Award from the Texas Historical Commission at a very nice ceremony during the Real Places 2020 conference on January 31 in Austin. Congratulations, Alvin!!!
The meeting was adjourned at 8:35 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,
Andy Burcham, Secretary

PAS Workshop: An Introduction
to Lithic Analysis
By: Dr. Scott Brosowske

This informal workshop will provide a basic introduction to the
analysis of chipped stone tools and debitage or flakes, the by-product of
lithic reduction. Given the time limitations of our meeting we will discuss raw material types commonly used by native peoples of the Southern Plains and their source locations, common chipped stone tool types
found in the region, lithic reduction strategies, and the analysis and interpretation of chipped stone tools and debitage. This workshop will include a short video on flintknapping, lecture, and hands on analysis of
chipped stone tools and debitage. During the latter we will work and
learn together in small groups. Participants who own or have access to
digital calipers and scales are encouraged to bring them.

2020 Perryton Stone Age Fair
Presented by

Courson Archaeological Research
10:00 AM to 5:00 PM April 25th, 2020
at
The Museum of the Plains
1200 N. Main
Perryton, Texas 79070

The Perryton Stone Age Fair provides artifact collectors with an opportunity to
showcase their prehistoric and historic Indian artifact collections. Equally important, the
event also provides a setting where collectors can meet with other collectors and exchange information. Persons with collections related to the pre-settlement era, specifically military or buffalo hunting, are also invited to attend. Individuals who are not interested in displaying artifacts they have found, but would like to learn more about them, are
also encouraged to bring them as archaeologists will be on hand to help with artifact
identification.
Buying, selling or trading of artifacts is not permitted at this event. Artifact reproductions may be displayed for educational purposes as long as they are labeled as such.
Exhibitor set-up is from 4:00-7:00 p.m. on Friday and from 8:00-10:00 a.m. on the
day of the show. The doors will open to the public at 10:00 a.m. and will close at 5:00
p.m. Admission is free and food and drinks will be available for purchase. Following the
fair exhibitors are invited to a free catered dinner and door prize give-way. To reserve
free table space or for additional information please contact Courson Archaeological Research at (806) 434-0157.
