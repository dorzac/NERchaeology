Management Summary
In December 2015, Vickrey & Associates, Inc., the CLIENT, contracted with Raba Kistner Environmental,
Inc. (RKEI), to perform an intensive pedestrian survey for a proposed 3.2-mile hike and bike trail along
Salado Creek in south-central Bexar County, Texas. The proposed trail is an extension of the existing
South Salado Creek Greenway Trail installed in 2008. Since portions of the project area is currently
owned by a political subdivision of the state, and the construction is funded by public funds, the project
falls under the Antiquities Code of Texas as administered by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The purpose of the survey was to determine whether historic or prehistoric cultural resources are
located within the Area of Potential Effect (APE), and, if so, assess their significance and eligibility for
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) and for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP). The project was carried out in early January 2016 under Texas Antiquities Committee
Permit No. 7491 issued to Dr. Steve A. Tomka who served as Principal Investigator. Kristi Nichols and
Mark Luzmoor acted as co-Project Archaeologists.
Surface visibility was approximately 90 percent throughout the APE. One backhoe trench (BHT) and
nineteen shovel tests (STs) were excavated along the APE in to locate buried cultural deposits. No
buried or surface-exposed significant historic or prehistoric materials were encountered during the
survey. All project related documents are permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. Given that no surface exposed or buried cultural deposits were identified within the
boundaries of the APE, RKEI recommends no additional archaeological work prior to the inception of the
construction of the hike and bike trail.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Area of Potential Effect
Raba Kistner Environmental (RKEI) was contracted by Vickrey & Associates, Inc. (CLIENT), to perform an
intensive pedestrian survey for a proposed 3.2-mile hike and bike trail along Salado Creek in southcentral Bexar County, Texas. The proposed trail is an extension of the existing South Salado Creek
Greenway Trail which was installed in 2008. Since the project area is currently owned by a political
subdivision of the state, and the project is funded by public monies, the project falls under the
Antiquities Code of Texas as administered by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The archaeological
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7491 issued to Dr. Steve A. Tomka who served
as the Principal Investigator. Kristi Nichols and Mark Luzmoor acted as co-Project Archaeologists.

The Area of Potential Effect
The Area-of-Potential Effect (APE) is located in south –central Bexar County, Texas. The survey area
encompasses a 3.2-mile long and 18-foot wide linear corridor. The project area is within the Salado
Creek watershed. The proposed trail connects to the existing South Salado Creek Greenway Trail,
adjoins a Private Golf Course, before returning to the east bank of Salado Creek. The APE is bounded by
Lions Park Lake to the north, SE Military Dr. to the south and follows along Salado Creek (Figure 1-1).
The APE is located on the San Antonio East (2998-113) and Southton (2998-132) 7.5-minute U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangle maps (Figure 1-2). The majority of the APE is located within the
active floodplain of Salado Creek. There are three proposed crossings of Salado Creek, two of which are
located within or adjacent to the Pecan Valley Golf Course.

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting
Project Area Setting
The project area is located in the geographic region referred to as the Edwards Plateau. The region is
bordered by the Blackland Prairie to the east and the Central/Llano Basin to the north. A gently rolling
landscape with seasonal drainages dominates the setting. Elevations in the northern part of the project
area are approximately 590 ft above mean sea level (amsl) and drop to 560 ft amsl along the southern
portion of the APE. The northern portion of the proposed trail will follow along the active floodplain of
along Salado Creek. A portion of the trail is proposed to run through the Pecan Valley Golf Course. The
golf course is currently inactive, and is privately owned property. The proposed trail in the southern half
of the APE follows along the active floodplain and the first terrace of Salado Creek. The proposed trail
was cross-cut by drainages that filter into Salado Creek.

Soils
The APE is within both the Venus-Frio-Trinity and the Lewisville-Houston Black terrace associations (Web
Soil Survey 2016). The soils within the Venus-Frio-Trinity association exhibit deep, calcareous soils on
bottom lands and terraces; whereas soils within the Lewisville-Houston Black association display deep,
calcareous clayey soils in old alluvium. These associations are dominated by three distinct soil types:
Houston Clay, Frio Clay Loam, and Venus Clay Loam.
Houston clays have 3-5 percent slopes and are usually severely eroded. Frio Clay Loam soils have 0-1
percent slopes and usually occur on the flood plains of tributary creeks or on low terraces bordering the
flood plains. These areas are flooded occasionally, and except for the lowest depressions, all of this soil
is well drained. The top 25-30 inches contains a soil that is light brownish grey in color. Below this, the
texture ranges between a sandy loam through stratified loam to a clay loam. There are water-rounded
limestone gravels between 3 and 6 feet deep. Venus Clay Loam soils have 1-3 percent slopes. The
surface layer is approximately 14 inches thick and the subsurface layer is 20 inches thick and is a clay
loam in texture but is less clayey than the surface layer (Web Soil Survey 2016).

Flora and Fauna
The project area is located near the intersection of the Balconian, Taumaulipan, and Texan biotic
provinces (Blair 1950). A diverse number of floral and faunal resources are available from these biotic
provinces.
Trees, plants, and grasses in this region include cedar (Juniperus ashei), live oak (Quercus fusiformis),
Texas mountain laurel (Sophora secundiflora), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), prickly pear (Optunia sp.),
agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), cat claw (Smilax bona-nox), mustang grape (Vitis mustangensis), sotol
(Dasylirion texanum), and Spanish dagger (Yucca sp.).
The fauna that inhabit the South-Central Texas region includes at least 95 bird and 29 mammal species.
The area also contains a wide array of reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Mammal species that were noted
along the ROW include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virgininana), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), and cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus audubonii).

South Texas Climate
The climate in South-central Texas is humid subtropical with hot and humid summers. From May
through September, hot weather dominates with the cool season beginning around the first of
November and extending through March. Winters are typically short and mild with little precipitation.
San Antonio averages only 33 inches of rain per year (Southern Regional Climate Center [SRCC] 2015;
based on monthly averages from 1980 to 2010). Monthly temperature averages range between 52°F in
January to 85°F in August.

Geology
The underlying geology of the project area is 100 percent Quaternary-age Fluviatile low-terrace deposits
adjacent to Salado Creek (Sellards 1919). These terrace deposits consist predominately of concretionary
calcite pebbles, gravel, and loam. Most low terrace deposits along entrenched waterways like Salado
Creek are above flood level (Sellards 1919) but they do flood frequently.

Chapter 3: Culture Chronology and Previous Archaeology
Culture Chronology
The cultural history of Bexar County and the vicinity spans approximately 11,500 years. Archaeologists
have divided the occupation of the region into four principal periods and several sub-periods:
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The periods are characterized by changes in climatic
conditions, distinct vegetation types, structure and concomitant adaptive changes by human
populations in hunting and gathering technologies and strategies, general material culture, and at the
tail end of the cultural sequence, the arrival of non-indigenous populations. The standard summaries of
the culture chronologies of Central Texas accepted by many of the regional archaeologists were
produced by Collins (1995) and Prewitt (1981). Below is a brief summary of the cultural sequence that
has been reconstructed by archaeologists for the south-central part of the state.

Paleoindian Period
The oldest cultural materials found in the region date to the Paleoindian period. The period spans
roughly from 11,500-8800 B.P. (Collins 1995, 2004). The Aubrey site in Denton County has one of the
earliest occupations, with radiocarbon assays dating to between 11,542 ± 11 B.P. and 11,590 ± 93 B.P.
(Bousman et al. 2004:48). Paleoclimatic proxy measures suggest that a cooler climate with increased
precipitation was predominant during the Late Pleistocene (Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al.
1993), the later portion of the period.
Initial reconstructions of Paleoindian adaptations typically viewed these hunter-gatherers as traversing
extreme distances in pursuit of now extinct mega-fauna such as mammoth and mastodon. While these
Paleoindians populations did exploit the Late Pleistocene mega-fauna when it was accessible, faunal
assemblages from a larger number of sites indicate that the Paleoindian diet was more varied and
consisted of a wide range of resources, including small game and plants. The Lewisville (Winkler 1982)
and the Aubrey sites (Ferring 2001) produced faunal assemblages that represented a wide range of taxa,
including large, medium, and small species. Information on the consumption of plant resources during
the Paleoindian period is lacking. Bousman et al. (2004) reported that the late Paleoindian component
at the Wilson-Leonard site reflected the exploitation of riparian, forest, and grassland species. Analysis
of Paleoindian skeletal remains indicates that the diets of the Paleoindian and later Archaic huntergatherers may have been similar (Bousman et al. 2004; Powell and Steele 1994).

7

The early portion of the Paleoindian period was characterized by the appearance of Clovis and Folsom
fluted projectile points that were used for hunting mega-fauna. Typical projectile points produced at
sites with occupations dating to the later portion of the Paleoindian period included the Plainview,
Dalton, Angostura, Golandrina, Meserve, and Scottsbluff types.

Meltzer and Bever (1995) have

identified 406 Clovis sites in Texas. One of the earliest, 41RB1, yielded radiocarbon assays that put the
maximum age for the Paleoindian component at 11,415 ± 125 B.P. (Bousman et al. 2004:47).
Sites in Bexar County that contain Paleoindian components include St. Mary’s Hall (Hester 1978, 1990),
Pavo Real (Collins et al. 2003), the Richard Beene site (Thoms et al. 1996; Thoms and Mandel 2006), and
41BX1396 (Tomka 2012).

St. Mary’s Hall, 41BX229, was first encountered in 1972 during the

construction of a house just outside the school property. The Pavo Real site, 41BX52, is located along
Leon Creek in northwest Bexar County.

The site was first documented in 1970 and has been

investigated several times over the past 40 years (Collins et al. 2003). The Richard Beene site, 41BX831,
is located along the Medina River in southern Bexar County (Thoms et al. 1996). Site 41BX1396 is
located in Brackenridge Park in San Antonio, and was encountered during installations for lighting in
2010. Dating of organic samples indicated that occupation at the site occurred as early as 10,490-10,230
B.P.

Archaic Period
The Archaic period dates between ca. 8800 to 1200 B.P. It is divided into three sub-periods: Early,
Middle, and Late. During the Archaic, mobility strategies may have shifted to more frequent short
distance movements that allowed the exploitation of seasonal resource patches. The intermittent
presence of bison in parts of Texas combined with changes in climatic conditions and the primary
productivity of the plant resources may have contributed to shifts in subsistence strategies and
associated technological repertoire. When bison was not present in the region, hunting strategies
focused on medium to small game along with continued foraging for plant resources. When bison was
available, hunter-gatherers targeted the larger-bodied prey on a regular basis.

Early Archaic
The Early Archaic spans from 8800 to 6000 B.P. (Collins 1995). Projectile point styles characteristic of
the Early Archaic include Angostura, Early Split Stem, Martindale, and Uvalde (Collins 1995). The Early
Archaic climate was drier than the Paleoindian period and witnessed a return to grasslands (Bousman

8

1998). Mega-fauna of the Paleoindian period could not survive the new climate and ecosystems,
therefore eventually died out. Early Archaic exploitation of medium to small fauna intensified.
The Wilson-Leonard excavation produced a wealth of cultural materials representative of a lengthy
period in regional prehistory. The projectile point assemblages from the site indicate that the lanceolate
Paleoindian point forms continue from the Paleoindian into the Early Archaic (Angostura). However,
relatively quickly during the Early Archaic, they are replaced by corner- and basally-notched and
shouldered forms (Early Triangular, Andice, Bell) that quickly become the dominant points tipping the
atlatl-thrown darts. In addition, the uses of small to medium hearths similar to the previous period
were noted too. The appearance of earth ovens suggests another shift in subsistence strategies. The
earth ovens encountered at the Wilson-Leonard site were used to cook wild hyacinth along with aquatic
and terrestrial resources (Collins et al. 1998). Analyses of Early Archaic human remains encountered in
Kerr County (Bement 1991) reveal diets low in carbohydrates in comparison to the Early Archaic
populations found in the Lower Pecos region.
Within Bexar County, the excavations at 41BX1396 revealed an Early Archaic component, radiocarbon
dated to cal B.P. 8390 to 8180 (Tomka 2012).

Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic sub-period spans from 6000 to 4000 B.P. (Collins 1995). Archaeological data
indicates that there appeared to be a population increase during this time. Climate was gradually drying
leading to the onset of a long drought period. Changes to the demographics and cultural characteristics
were likely in response to the warmer and more arid conditions (Robinson 1982). Projectile point styles
characteristic of this sub-period include Bell, Andice, Calf Creek, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis.
Subsistence during the Middle Archaic saw an increased reliance on nuts and other products of riverine
environments (Black 1989).

The increase of burned rock middens during the Middle Archaic

represented the increased focus on the use of plant resources (Black 1989; Johnson and Goode 1994).
Little is known about burial practices during the Middle Archaic. An excavation in an Uvalde County
sinkhole (41UV4) contained 25-50 individuals (Johnson and Goode 1994:28).

Late Archaic
The Late Archaic spans from 4000 to 1200 B.P. (Collins 2004). It is represented by the Bulverde,
Pedernales, Kinney, Lange, Marshall, Williams, Marcos, Montell, Castroville, Ensor, Frio, Fairland, and

9

Darl projectile points. The early part of the Late Archaic exhibited fluctuations in the temperature and
rainfall. There appears to have been an increase in population at this time (Nickels et al. 1998).
Some researchers believe that the use of burned rock middens decreased during the Late Archaic. Some
research has challenged this notion (Black and Creel 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Johnson and Goode
(1994) discuss the role of burned rock middens in relation to acorn processing.
Human remains from burials related to the Late Archaic in Central and South Texas suggest the region
saw an increase in population. This increase may have prompted the establishment of territorial
boundaries which resulted in boundary disputes (Story 1985). Human remains dating to this sub-period
have been encountered near the Edwards Plateau.

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period begins ca. 1200 B.P. (Collins 1995, 2004), and appears to continue until the
beginning of the Protohistoric period (ca. A.D. 1700). The term Late Prehistoric is used in Central and
South Texas to designate the time following the end of the Archaic Period.

A series of traits

characterizes the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period. The main technological changes
were the shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery. The Late Prehistoric period is
divided into two phases: the Austin phase and the Toyah phase.
At the beginning of this period, environmental conditions were deemed to be warm and dry. Moister
conditions appear after 1000 B.P. (Mauldin and Nickels 2001). Subsistence practices appeared similar to
the Late Archaic. Projectile points associated with the Austin phase include the Scallorn and Edwards
types. The Toyah phase is characterized by the prominence of the Perdiz point (Collins 1995).
Most researchers concur that the early portion of the Late Prehistoric period saw a decrease in
population density (Black 1989:32). Radiocarbon dates from some sites have indicated that the middens
were utilized during the Late Prehistoric. Some archaeologists feel the peak of midden use was after
A.D. 1 and into the Late Prehistoric (Black and Creel 1997:273). Radiocarbon dates from Camp Bowie
middens provide evidence that supports Black and Creel’s arguments that burned rock middens were a
primarily Late Prehistoric occurrence (Mauldin et al. 2003).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. This shift is characterized by
the introduction of blade technology, the first ceramics in Central Texas (bone-tempered plainwares),
the appearance of Perdiz arrow points, and alternately beveled bifaces (Black 1989:32; Huebner

10

1991:346). Prewitt (1981) suggests this technology originated in North-Central Texas. Patterson (1988),
however, notes that the Perdiz point was first seen in Southeast Texas by about 1350 B.P., and was
introduced to West Texas some 600 to 700 years later.
Early ceramics in Central Texas (ca. A.D. 1250 to 1300) are associated with the Toyah phase of the Late
Prehistoric and are referred to as Leon Plain ware. The Leon Plain ceramic types are undecorated, bonetempered bowls, jars, and ollas with oxidized, burnished, and floated exterior surfaces (Ricklis 2004).
There is notable variation within the type (Black 1986; Johnson 1994; Kalter et al. 2005). This variation
can be attributed to differences in manufacturing techniques and cultural affiliation. Analysis of
residues on ceramic sherds suggests that vessels were used to process bison bone grease/fat, mesquite
bean/bison bone grease, and deer/bison bone grease (Quigg et al. 1993).
The return of bison to South and Central Texas during the Late Prehistoric resulted from a drier climate
in the plains located to the north of Texas and increased grasses in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak
Savannah in North-Central Texas (Huebner 1991). The increased grasses in the two biotas formed the
“bison corridor” along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau and into the South Texas Plain (Huebner
1991:354-355). Rock shelter sites, such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and
Classen Rock Shelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967), have indicated a shift in settlement
strategies (Skinner 1981). Burials encountered that dated to this period often reveal evidence of conflict
(Black 1989:32).

Historic Period
The beginnings of San Antonio came about with the establishment of Mission San Antonio de Valero in
1718. Fray Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares had briefly visited the site several years prior, and
petitioned to set up a mission at the headwaters of the San Antonio River to act as a waypoint in the
journey to East Texas. The Marques de Valero, Viceroy of New Spain, granted Olivares’ request and
granted him permission (de la Teja 1995). Mission Valero occupied at least two locations before it
settled into its current spot. The final location was in use by 1724.
Five days after Mission Valero was founded, Presidio de Bexar was established. The presidio was to
house the Spanish soldiers who had come along with the expedition to found the Mission. Typically, the
families that followed the soldiers lived just outside the presidio.
Two years later, in 1720, Mission San José y San Miguel de Aguayo was established on the opposite bank
of the San Antonio River, and to the south of Mission Valero and Presidio San Antonio de Bexar. This
11

mission was established to help serve native groups that did not want to reside at Mission Valero
because they were not on friendly terms with groups already living there. The original location of
Mission San José was along the east bank of the San Antonio River, approximately three leagues from
Mission Valero. The mission was then moved to the opposite bank sometime between 1724 and 1729,
and relocated to its present site during the 1740s due to an epidemic (Scurlock et al. 1976:222).
In 1722, just two years after Mission San José was founded, Mission San Francisco Xavier de Nàjera was
established. The mission was to serve a group of 50 Ervipiami families that came from the Brazos River
area (Schuetz 1968:11). Mission San Francisco Xavier de Nàjera was located on or near the present site
of Mission Concepción. The mission was unsuccessful due to a lack of funding. An attempt was made to
make the mission a sub-mission of Valero, but this failed as well (Habig 1968:78-81). Its doors closed in
1726 (Schuetz 1968:11). Ivey (1984:13) argued that the closure of the mission was due to the natives’
lack of interest in entering mission life.
Within the next few years, four other missions were established within the San Antonio area. The
remaining three missions were established in San Antonio within weeks of each other in 1731. These
three missions, Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purisima Concepción, Mission San Juan de Capistrano, and
Mission San Francisco de la Espada, were originally missions established in east Texas. When each failed
along the eastern border, they were moved to San Antonio.
In addition to the five missions, the civilian community outside of the mission and presidio, Villa San
Fernando de Bexar was established by the Canary Islanders. Prior to the establishment of Villa San
Fernando, Villa de Bexar had been settled by 30 presidial soldiers, seven of whom were married and
brought their families. Archival research indicates that upon arrival, the Canary Islanders immediately
took over the land surrounding the garrison. This land was used as pasture and was originally property
of Mission Valero. There had been a lack of cleared agricultural land at the time, leading Captain Juan
Antonio Pérez de Almazán to allow the Canary Islanders use of the property (de la Teja 1995). The initial
plan was for additional Canary Island settlers to be sent to San Antonio after the first group was
established. Due to high costs to the Spanish Crown, no more groups were brought to Texas. The
Canary Islanders launched a formal complaint against Mission Valero. In 1731, the Canary Islanders
established their own villa, named San Fernando de Bexar, with their own church. The arrival of the
Isleños resulted in the first clearly defined civilian settlement in San Antonio.
During the early years of the Villa de Bexar, no formal titles were issued as the property was distributed.
If a presidial soldier and his family occupied the property, they likely did not own it (de la Teja 1995).
12

Prior to 1731, soldiers and settlers were issued licenses to build houses on and farm the land
surrounding the garrison. The area was considered the royal property of the presidio (Ivey 2008).
During the early years of the Villa de Bexar and San Fernando de Bexar, the property that was granted to
the Isleños after 1745 and the settlers changed hands several times. The Isleños requested more
property in the Labores, and attempted to hinder the original settlers from obtaining any more land.
Though their efforts were not entirely successful, they did slow the amount of property given to the
settlers (de la Teja 1995). As grants were passed out, it appears that the Isleños would sell their original
grants to incoming settlers, or current non-Isleño inhabitants, then request an additional grant from the
government. By the 1800s, seven families had control of approximately half of the suertes that had
been distributed during the mid- to-late 1700s (de la Teja 1995).

Previous Archaeological Investigations in the Vicinity of the APE
A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas found that several archaeological investigations have
been conducted in the vicinity of Salado Creek. One previous archaeological investigation had been
conducted that touched portions of the current proposed trail (Figure 3-1). The West Salado Creek
Outfall project was conducted by the University of Texas at San Antonio’s Center for Archaeological
Research (UTSA-CAR) in two phases in 1988. Phase I of the survey was located to the west of Salado
Creek, near Valle Vista Street. The linear survey crossed the route of the currently proposed trail in two
places. During the Phase I survey of the area, a prehistoric site composed of lithic tools and burned rock
was identified. The site, 41BX785, consisted of lithic debitage and burned rock fragments found in the
shovel tests and on the surface.

The site was recommended for further investigation before

construction (Burkett and Huebner 1989). Although not depicted on the Texas Archaeological Sites
Atlas, it appears that the site was located in the project area along Valle Vista Street. Later in the year,
the second phase of the project focused on examining the site. Investigations revealed that the
subsurface portion of the prehistoric site was intact; two stratified occupation levels were identified. No
diagnostic cultural materials were recovered during the investigation. A notable amount of lithic
debitage was recovered in the central area of the site, as well as unidentified biface fragments and
burned rock. The burned rock was believed to be displaced hearth stones (Burkett 1989). Site 41BX785
was recommended for mitigation as it was located within the pipeline easement.

The site was

considered potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and as a State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL).

In 1972, Anne Fox recorded a collection of artifacts on the surface (41BX176) approximately 0.8 km to
the southeast of the APE. These artifacts included human bone fragments (at least three individuals,
both child and adult), mussel shell, two Scallorn points, and a shell pendant with punctate design. The
site was thought date between Archaic and early Neo-Historic. This collection of artifacts was thought
to have been the work of pot-hunters. Since protection of the site was clearly impossible, Fox suggested
that it should be examined for more burials, but the landowner was resistant to the idea.
In 1977, UTSA-CAR conducted a survey for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) along a portion of
Salado Creek. During the survey, site 41BX361 was recorded as a multicomponent site. The prehistoric
material encountered at the site included a lithic scatter, burned rock, scrapers, an untyped projectile
point tip, a base of an untyped point, cores, bifaces, shell(snail and mussel), and faunal material. The
historic component consisted of two glass bottles; one was green glass with medicine measurements
(THC 2016).
Another site recorded during the 1977 survey was 41BX362. The site consisted of a lithic scatter with
cores, scrapers, and crude bifaces noted during the surface inspection. Although the site was disturbed
by erosion, it appeared to be in good condition. The site was not recommended for further work (THC
2016).
In 1983, UTSA-CAR conducted the San Antonio Wastewater Facilities archaeological investigation
parallel to Salado Creek. During the survey, site 41BX595 was recorded as a possible historic structure
and prehistoric lithic scatter. The structure was described as constructed of cut stone blocks with a
possible slate roof. Another site, 41BX596, was recorded during the survey. Site 41BX596 was
described as a small amount of lithic debris, rabdotus snail shells, fresh water mussel shell fragments,
and burned rock fragments. No collections were made and the site was not recommended for further
work (THC 2016).
In 2007, UTSA-CAR conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey along the Southern portion
of Salado Creek. The work was conducted in advance of construction of a multi-use greenway trail
between Rigsby Avenue to South Side Lions Park East along Salado Creek proposed by the Parks and
Recreation Department of the City of San Antonio. An intensive pedestrian survey was conducted along
the area to be impacted by the proposed trail. One archaeological site, 41BX1756, was recorded during
the course of the project. The multicomponent site consisted of the remains of a house, as well as lithic
debitage recovered from shovel testing. UTSA-CAR recommended that the site be avoided although it

15

retained no archaeological significance. The site was determined to be ineligible for listing in the NRHP
or as a SAL (Kemp and Moses 2008).
In December 2009, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. conducted an archaeological survey for proposed
improvements at South Side Lions Park in the City of San Antonio, Texas. The archaeological survey
examined the footprints of the proposed facilities and improvements. During the survey, site 41BX1857
was recorded along the western edge of the park. Surface inspection revealed gravels mixed with cores
and flakes; artifacts associated with lithic reduction. The site is thin and exposed on an upland surface,
and like most of the park, is very disturbed. Site 41BX1857 was recommended as ineligible for
designation as a SAL (McWilliams and Kibler 2009).
Another survey conducted in close proximity to the current APE was an intensive pedestrian survey of a
13.1 acre area completed in 2012 by UTSA-CAR. The survey consisted of an area of old Pecan Valley Golf
Club. The project is currently the site of the new Masters Ranch Apartments complex. During the
course of the survey, eight shovel tests and seven backhoe trenches were excavated to search for
cultural deposits before the construction of new apartments could take place. As a result of the survey,
one piece of debitage and one piece of burned rock was encountered in a backhoe trench and one piece
of debitage was encountered in a shovel test that was 8 meters away from the backhoe trench. Even
though these two positive units would define an archaeological site, UTSA-CAR determined that the
deposits in which the artifacts were found in were very sparse and that they were encountered in a
secondary context. Therefore, UTSA-CAR recommended to not formally define the two positive units as
a site (Blomquist 2013).
In 2014, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. conducted an archaeological survey for the proposed District 3
community center at South Side Lions Park in San Antonio, Texas. The investigation found that much of
the project area had been disturbed by previous construction and landscaping within the park
boundaries. One archaeological site was recorded during the survey, 41BX2037. The site was identified
as a prehistoric lithic scatter, although the scatter was ephemeral and disturbed. Site 41BX2037 was
recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP and designation as a SAL as it possessed little
archaeological significance. The proposed improvements at the park were recommended to proceed as
planned (THC 2016).
In May of 2014, UTSA-CAR conducted an intensive pedestrian survey for the University of Incarnate
Word. Two archaeological sites were recorded during the survey, 41BX2065 and Field Site 1. Site
41BX2065 consisted of lithic debitage and burned rock that was present on the surface. No tools or
16

diagnostic artifacts were encountered during shovel testing or backhoe trenching. Deposits at the site
were of extremely low density and backhoe trenching did not reveal any deeper, increased density
deposits. No cultural features or temporal diagnostics were recovered. Field Site 1 is a prehistoric site
located at the southern edge of the project area north of the golf course. The site is defined by two
positive shovel tests located within 30 meters of one another, containing one piece of lithic debitage
and one piece of burned rock. Backhoe trenching in the area did not reveal any deeper deposits (THC
2016).
On August 8, 2014, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. conducted an archaeological survey for a proposed
pedestrian trail and park facilities area in South Side Lions Park in San Antonio, Texas. The survey did
not encounter any archaeological materials and determined that proposed trail and facilities areas have
been disturbed by landscape modifications, illegal dumping, and erosion. Therefore, the project area
has no potential for archaeological sites eligible for listing in the NRHP or designation as a SAL. Hence,
no further archaeological work is recommended. No archaeological materials requiring curation were
recovered during this project (THC 2016).

Chapter 4: Field and Laboratory Methodology
Field Methods
As part of the intensive pedestrian survey of the APE, RKEI utilized a combination of surface
reconnaissance, shovel testing to search for shallowly buried archaeological deposits, and limited
backhoe trenching to identify cultural deposits that were potentially buried below the reach of the
typical shovel testing: 60 cm below surface (cmbs).

Shovel Testing
The pedestrian survey was accompanied by shovel testing at intervals along the ROW. All shovel tests
were approximately 30 cm in diameter and, unless prevented by obstacles or buried features, extended
to a depth of 60 cmbs. Each shovel test was excavated in 10-cm increments. All soil from each level was
screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Any encountered artifacts recovered were to be labeled
with appropriate provenience information for laboratory processing and analysis. A shovel test form
was completed for each excavated shovel test. Data collected from the shovel test included the final
excavation depth, a tally of all materials encountered from each 10-cm level, and a brief soil description
(texture, consistency, Munsell color, inclusions). The location was recorded using a Garmin, hand-held,
GPS unit. Shovel test locations were sketched onto a current aerial photograph of the APE as a backup
to the GPS information. Any additional observation considered pertinent was included as comments on
the standard shovel test excavation form.

Backhoe Trenching
One backhoe trench (BHT) was excavated once the initial pedestrian survey was completed and the
Project Archaeologist established a high probability location within the APE.
The trench was 4 meters in length and was 0.7 meters wide to allow ease of access. The trench did not
exceed 1.5 meters in depth. A representative segment of one trench wall was cleaned for observation
and documentation. The cleared wall was photographed with a scale, and a detailed profile drawing
was made of the soil strata observed. Any artifacts noted in the representative trench wall segment
were to be shown on the profile. Only temporally diagnostic materials were to be collected from the
backhoe trenches.

18

Laboratory Methods
All project-related documentation produced during the survey was prepared in accordance with federal
regulation 36 CFR Part 79, and THC requirements for State Held-in-Trust collections. Field notes, field
forms, photographs, and field drawings were placed into labeled archival folders and converted into
electronic files. Digital photographs were printed on acid-free paper, labeled with archivally appropriate
materials, and were placed in archival-quality plastic sleeves when needed. All field forms were
completed with pencil. Ink-jet produced maps and illustrations were placed in archival quality plastic
page protectors to prevent against accidental smearing due to moisture. A copy of the report and all
digital materials was saved onto a CD and stored with field notes and documents. Since no artifacts
were encountered during the course of the project, no cultural material was curated. All project-related
documentation is permanently housed at The Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory.

19

Chapter 5: Results of Investigation
The archaeological pedestrian survey was conducted over the course of several days in January 2016.
On January 6 and 11, 2016, RKEI staff excavated 19 shovel tests (STs) along the course of the proposed
hike and bike trail to search for shallowly buried cultural deposits (Figure 5-1). The shovel tests in the
northern portion of the APE were placed where visibility was less than 30 percent. Within the golf
course, shovel tests avoided the concrete golf cart paths. Access to the golf course was limited due to
right of entry issues. In the southern portion of the APE, the majority of the shovel tests were placed
outside of the informal, local trail. Two were excavated within the footprint of the path to determine
construction methods, if any. RKEI staff monitored the excavation of a single backhoe trench (BHT) on
January 20, 2016 (Figure 5-1). The trench was located near the southernmost crossing of the hike and
bike trail on the first terrace of Salado Creek.

Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
Nineteen shovel tests were excavated during the course of the project (see Figure 5-1). The soil in each
shovel test ranged in color between a very dark greyish brown (10YR3/2) and a reddish brown
(2.5YR5/4) (Table 5-1). Soil texture ranged between saturated clay and dry/course silty clay.

The pedestrian survey of the northern section of the APE found that the trail will mostly be constructed
within the active flood plain of Salado Creek. A small section at the northern terminus of the trail will be
constructed on the first terrace of the creek. Shovel Test 1 was excavated near the proposed trail head
and encountered intact soils but no cultural material.

Within the middle portion of the APE, it was

noted that the proposed trail will abut the Masters Ranch Apartments complex that was currently under
22

construction (Figure 5-2).

Shovel Tests that were excavated within the golf course encountered

disturbed soils and mottled fill. The trail within the southern half of the APE follows an existing informal
trail that is used by the local community for pedestrian use as well as areas that appear to be used by
ATVs and BMX bikes. The southern portion of the APE exhibits two to three terraces, with residential
structures occupying the highest terrace. The proposed trail follows along the active floodplain and first
terrace. It appears that the first terrace floods frequently as well as the floodplain, with debris noted in
the trees as much as 5 ft above surface in areas. Shovel tests were placed on the edges of the current
trail, although two were placed in the center of the trail to determine if the trail at one time had a
caliche base.

Figure 5-2. New apartment buildings being constructed immediately west of the proposed hike and bike
trail.
The survey encountered many areas of standing water along the southern half of the proposed trail
route. These area were noted on both the floodplain and first terrace, indicating that both retain water

23

for a period after each episode of rain. The standing water created areas of heavy mud that made
traversing both on foot and with heavy machinery difficult (Figure 5-3). Multiple drainages filtering into
the creek have cross-cut the informal trail.

Figure 5-3. Heavily inundated area immediately south of BHT 1.
All but one ST reached the designated depth of 60 cmbs. Shovel Test 10, located at the northern end of
the golf course, encountered water at 45 cmbs and was halted after it reached 50 cmbs. In ST 8, located
within the golf course, construction material was encountered throughout the entire shovel test. These
materials were most likely within the fill that was brought in to build up the golf course. STs 11 and 13
were placed within an established trail that ranged from 2.5-4 meters in width. Shovel tests indicated
that only the top levels were disturbed from the constant foot and vehicle traffic along this trail. It
should also be noted that the trail was not formally constructed with a gravel or caliche base. The
informal trail had been created and modified by local residents. Evidence of use were noted in the

24

presence of graffiti on trees and rocks, an ATV and BMX bike course created along the trail south of Valle
Vista, and areas of construction material and residential trash.

Backhoe Trenching
Once the pedestrian survey and shovel testing was completed, locations for backhoe trenches were
determined. The Pecan Valley Golf Course had impacted banks of the creek along the proposed route
and likely contained imported fill. The proposed trail was designed to cross the creek in two locations
within the golf course. One location exhibited an existing bridge. Upon consultation with the CLIENT,
RKEI was informed that the owners of the golf course were responsible for the bridge. At the
southernmost portion of the golf course, a crossing was proposed that would impact the privately
owned golf course property on the north side of the creek as well as public property to the south. Right
of entry issues prevented the excavation of a backhoe trench on the private property. The south bank
of the creek at this crossing was inaccessible by heavy machinery due to the erosional cuts created by
drainages, and areas of standing water and mud. To search for deeply buried deposits within the APE, a
backhoe trench was placed along the far southern portion of the project area where a bridge is
proposed to be constructed across Salado Creek (see Figure 5-1).
BHT 1 was excavated approximately one hundred feet to the west of Salado Creek. It was placed on the
first terrace of Salado Creek in an attempt to be out of the flood plain. The trench was 4 meters long,
0.7 meters wide and 1.5 meters deep. There were four major depositional zones within the trench
(Figures 5-4). Zone 1 consisted of a very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) sandy loam humus layer from 0
to 67 cmbs. Zone 2 was a lighter dark greyish brown (10YR4/2) sandy loam that extended to 82 cmbs.
Zone 3 was comprised of a brown (10YR5/3) loamy sand and 65 percent calcium carbonates. Zone 4
was a slightly darker brown (10YR4/3) and contained no calcium carbonates. The consistency of the soil
was extremely soft from 0 to 82 cmbs, and it became much harder and coarser from 82 to 150 cmbs. No
cultural material was encountered in the backdirt from the excavation of BHT 1 or within the profile of
the wall after it was cleaned.

Chapter 6: Summary and Recommendations
Vickrey & Associates, Inc. (Client) contracted with RKEI to perform an intensive pedestrian survey for a
proposed 3.2 mile hike and bike trail along Salado Creek near San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The
proposed trail is an extension of the existing South Salado Creek Greenway Trail which was installed in
2008. As a part of the intensive pedestrian survey of the APE, RKEI utilized a combination of surface
reconnaissance, shovel testing, and limited backhoe trenching to search for buried cultural deposits
across the APE.
A 100 percent pedestrian survey was conducted along the entire length of the APE that included shovel
testing throughout a 3.2 mile corridor project area and backhoe trenching near the southern creek
crossing. The entire proposed trail appears to be located within the active floodplain of Salado Creek,
except for a small portion at the trailhead from Lions Park. The northern portion of the proposed trail
follows along the active floodplain of Salado Creek, and enters the heavily modified, but inactive, Pecan
Valley Golf Course. South of the golf course, the proposed trail will be constructed on either the
floodplain or first terrace. Multiple drainages into the creek caused erosional cuts into the informal trail
along the southern half of the APE. The already existing trail had been created and heavily modified by
local residents.
Nineteen shovel tests and one backhoe trench were excavated during the survey to search for shallow
and deeply buried cultural deposits within the 3.2 mile proposed trail corridor. No surface-exposed or
buried historic or prehistoric materials were identified during the course of the survey.
The lack of historic or prehistoric cultural material located during the survey and backhoe trenching of
the APE indicates that there is a low probability that the area contains significant buried historic or
prehistoric deposits. RKEI recommends that no further archaeological investigations are warranted, and
the planned improvements can proceed as scheduled. Should changes be made to the project APE,
further work may be required.
