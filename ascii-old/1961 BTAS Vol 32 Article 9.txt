The Utilization of Archeological and
Ethnohistorical Data In Estimating
Aboriginal Population
1

HERBERT C. TAYLOR, JR.

Reliable estimates for most aboriginal North American groups are
difficult to achieve because the first governmental censuses were
normally performed after a radical though indeterminate populational
decline had occurred. In this article it is proposed to examine the
Mooney population estimates for the southern Northwest Coast (the
figures utilized by Kroeber in his Cultural and Natural Areas of Native
North America, 1939) in the light of a combination of available
archaeological and ethnohistorical data.
The area under discussion and termed, rather unfortunately, the
"southern Northwest Coast" (the only reasonable alternative seems to
be the lower Northwest Coast which is equally unfortunate) is meant
by the author to include the lower Columbia area, the Puget Sound
area, Coastal Washington, the Gulf of Georgia area and Vancouver
Island. Not included are: the Coast of Oregon below the mouth of the
Columbia, the Williamette Valley, and the mainland coast of British
Columbia above the Straits of Georgia . The delineation may seem
rather arbitrary. North of this region, however, Mooney, and hence
Kroeber, go in for rather large block estimates of territory; and while
there is some ethnohistorical material bearing upon these populations,
there is virtually no archaeological material. To the south one encounters a rather vexed question of where the long limp tail of the

Northwest Coast cultural dog ceases to exist and the California area
begins. In this connection it should be remembered that Kroeber, while
utilizing Mooney's estimates in all other areas of America north of
Mexico, used his own estimates for the population of California area
and discarded Mooney's. From a "tribal" or linguistic point of view,
therefore, this article is concerned with the aboriginal population of
the Kwakuitl, Nutka, Coast Salish (with the exception of the Bella
Coola north of this area and the Tillamook south of this area) the
Chinook and those two intrusive enc!aves of Athabascan-speakers, the
Tlatskanai and the Willapa.
Chart 1 shows Mooney's population figures for the base year 1780
adapted to Kroeber's cultural sub-areas. This chart is taken directly
from Cultural and Natural Areas of Native North-America, (Kroeber,
1939: 135-136) except that under the heading of Gulf of Georgia, the
term "Cowichan" has been substituted for the word "Cowlitz" (which
must have been what Kroeber meant ) .
Before beginning a critique of these population estimates in the
light of archeological and ethnohistorical data, a few paragraphs
would appear to be in order concerning the origin of estimates which
Kroeber employed in his monumental study and which have
subsequently approximated demographic Holy Writ to many
anthropologists.
In 1910 I ames Mooney published a very short article under the
title, "Population," in Frederick Webb Hodge's compendious Handbook of American Indians (Hodge, 1910: 286-287 ). Evidently a
longer article had originally been planned, but size and scope made
separate publication mandatory. The Handbook article notes (p. 287 )
that a separate issue of the Bulletin would be devoted to such a topic.
Mooney died in 1921 without completing his task. Only the section
on New England was entirely complete together with the textual (but
not the tabular ) material on New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. However, in the years 1908-1909, Mooney had prepared a
briefer statement giving a set of tables of population for all of America
north of Mexico. It is this brief statement and accompanying tables
which Swanton edited and published in 1928 (Swanton, in Mooney,
1928: 1, 2 ) .
In the course of his prefatory remarks, Swanton does not make clear
why this article was not published in Mooney's lifetime-one may
infer that Mooney wished instead to publish the longer definitive study
upon which he was at work. Nor does Swanton explain why seven
years elapsed after Mooney's death before the briefer completed article

was published. In any event, the net effect was that the article was
twenty years old when it first saw print. Even by today's publishing
standards this was a noteworthy delay . It goes without saying that
those same twenty years saw a rapid burgeoning of publications in
American ethnology whose utilization might have materially altered
population estimates.
Recognizing Mooney's charts as the first scholarly attempt to establish ord er where there had been demographic chaos before, A. L. Kroeber determined to utilize Mooney's figures in his own study on natural
and cultural areas (with the aforenoted exception of California ) .
Kroeber's manuscript was ready for publication in 1931 , but the Great
D epression delayed publication un til 1939. A reduction of the population section was published in the American Anthropologist in 1934.
In the 1939 publication Kroeber (pp. 171-181 ) includes a review of
literature concerned with aboriginal North American demography
from 193 1 to 1939, and in his earlier publication ( 1934) he cited a

124

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

number of works to which Mooney had not had access when he prepared his tables. However, it must be stressed that these later publications did not (save in the instance of California) affect the population
figures employed by Kroeber in 1939. He utilized the tables which
Mooney had prepared in 1908-1909.
The population estimates of Mooney were regarded by Kroeber and
by Mooney's posthumous editor, J. R. Swanton, as provisional in
character. It was anticipated that periodic changes would be made in
these estimates as more data were accumulated and more sophisticated
demographers addressed themselves to the problem of aboriginal
population.
In fact, nothing of the sort occurred. Mooney's estimates, and more
particularly Kroeber's population density studies employing Mooney's
estimates, almost universally are utilized to this day when questions
of aboriginal demography in America north of Mexico arise. (Thus
Mooney's figures are continually cited as the pre-contact population
data by Swanton, in his The Indian Tribes of North America, published in 1952.)

Archeological Data Bearing on Aboriginal Southern
Northwest Coast Population Estimates
While it is true that Kroeber utilized Mooney's estimates in formulating his own population density figures, he expressed considerable
reservations about the accuracy of Mooney's figures for the southern
Northwest Coast:
In the Oregon-Washington region, the Salish seem underweighted as
against the Sahaptin and Chinook. Thus, United States Salish on coast,
6,200; on Puget Sound, 6,800; in the interior, including Idaho and Montana, 8,700; total, 21,700; Sahaptin, 18,100 ; Chinook, 22,000; Yaquina,
Alsea, Sinuslaw, Kus, 8,000. The definitely greater heaviness of population
on the lower Columbia is indubitable, but perhaps not quite to the degree
implied. Also, the Sahaptin, with a smaller territory, are given more than
twice the population of the interior Salish in the United States.
In British Columbia, on the contrary, the Salish are favored: on the coast,
including 1,400 Bella Coola, 21,900; in the interior, 16,500; total, 38,400;
all Nutka, Kwakiutl, Tsimshian, Haida, 30,000. This makes 20,500 coast
Salish in modern British territory fronting on the Gulf of Georgia, as
against only 31,400 population on all the remainder of the coast of British
Columbia. Such a distribution would expectably have produced some
superior florescence of culture on the Gulf of Georgia. However, as dis-

ESTIMATING ABORIGINAL POPULATION

cussed below, Mooney's estimates pretty consistently put the great densities in the southern half of the Northwest Coast, which is not incompatible
with the view developed above a relatively recent seaward and northward shift of the climax of this culture (Kroeber, 1939: 133-134).
And later in his text Kroeber adds:
Even if Mooney's computations for the Chinook and Gulf of Georgia Salish
are taken as somewhat high, the generally greater density of the south as
against the north remains fundamentally unimpaired. On this point, too,
shore-line density would not invert the situation, the northerly areas
having the more irregular, indented shore, the ratio of which to the
already lighter population would go up faster even than their land areas.
The difference seems to lie in this: The northern groups were essentially
maritime, mostly lived fronting the beach, and made little use of the land
which they owned. The southern groups lived on river and tributary as
well as on the shore, perhaps more largely so, in fact, and often made
genuine use of their land holdings. Their habitat utilization and culture
remained more generalized and simpler; those of the northern groups
were more specialized and extreme. As in the Southwest, on comparison
of Gila-California with Pueblo sphere, the more generalized method in the
long run permitted of a heavier aggregate population (Kroeber, 1939:
156).
Kroeber in these passages advances three views which recent archeological survey work has tended to substantiate:

1. That Mooney underestimated relatively the coastal Salish population
in the Puget Sound area and on Washington's coast.
2. That quite possibly the Nutka, Kwakiutl, Tsimshian, and Haida have
been underestimated relative to estimates for the Gulf of Georgia Salish.
3. That even allowing for possible error in the above, Mooney is certainly
correct in assigning a much heavier populational density to the
southern portion of the Northwest Coast, since this was the area of
more generalized ecological adjustment emphasizing hunting, as well
as dependence upon the sea.
The last of these three assertions is the most easily verified. From
the southern entrance to the Gulf of Georgia, that is to say from a point
just south of the Canadian line and north of Bellingham Bay on the
mainland and from the southern tip of Vancouver Island, going north
to the northern extremity of the Gulf of Georgia at Cape Mudge, there
is a remarkably impressive proliferation of giant midden heaps. Virtually every bay or inlet which possesses or had possessed a fresh water
stream has one or more such archeological sites. In the main, however,
these sites are relatively small. Ruling out the seasonal or sporadically

126

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

occupied sites and dealing only with those sites which would appear to
have contained permanent villages, the surveyor is left with the impression that the median population of the villages would have been
well below 50.
North of Cape Mudge, on Quadra Island, and north of Campbell
River on Vancouver Island (that is to say, leaving coast Salish territory and going into what was circa 1840 Kwakiutl territory) one encounters far fewer villages. On the other hand, the villages which are
encountered are much larger, some of them surely housing as many as
300 people (Taylor, 1956: 53-55; Taylor and Duff, 1956: 56, 57, 6065). Thus Kroeber's view that a greater population density could occur in the south because of a more general or less specialized ecological
adjustment and au contraire, that to the north, in the "climax area,"
there were fewer people, more highly specialized, more truly committed to a maritime way of life, and with a more complex social organization, would seem to be substantiated by archeological evidence.
Further buttressing Kroeber's view that Puget Sound, coastal Washington, and the area about the mouth of the Columbia represented a
more generalized and older ecological adjustment, is the presence of
heavy concentrations of large land mammal bone in a number of the
archeological sites excavated and/ or tested in this region. In some
instances, notably in the San Juan Islands and in coastal Oregon immediately to the south of the Columbia, large land mammals evidently
supplied almost as much of the total caloric supply as did fish. (Living
ethnological informants and some ethnologists to the contrary notwithstanding, no salt-water aboriginal group in this area relied nearly as
heavily on fish as on shell fish. The aboriginal groups about Cape Flattery seem, on the basis of one test excavation undertaken there in 1955,
to have relied very heavily upon whaling.)
Perhaps even more significantly, a number of test excavations have
indicated that the incidence of heavy land mammal bone goes up relative to the incidence of fish bone and heavy wood-working equipment,
as one goes back in time. 2 This, of course, dovetails beautifully with
Kroeber's hypothesis that the southern area represented an older, more
generalized hunting tradition that had gradually adapted to a mari2 This phenomenon, so far as the writer is aware, has not been reported in print
heretofore. It was first observed by VVarrPn Caldwell, then teaching assistant at
the University of Washington, and the author in the course of excavations on Lopez
Island ( 1962--1953 ) . It was subsequently observed in a test excavation at Tillamook
in 1953. Our paper discussing the phenom~non was read by Taylor to the North west Anthropological Association in 1954.

time environment, while the northern area represented an highly
specialized maritime adjustment.
Turning to Kroeber's first assertion that Mooney underestimated
relatively the coastal Salish population in the Puget Sound area and
in the Pacific Coast of Washington, the following points may be noted:
a. The p attern of occupation, as r evea l ed by archeologica l survey, noted
for the Gulf of Georgia ar ea, ends a bruptly at the northern end of the
Gulf of Georgia . However, there is no su ch break to the south. The
Puget Sound area, the Stra it of Juan de Fuca area, and coasta l W ash ington h a ve a ver y high inciden ce of r elativel y sm a ll perman ent
villages and an even hi gh er incid en ce of seasonal or sporadica lly
occupied sites.
b . While the writer conducted no exca va tions in this survey of eastern
Vancouver Island, inspection of n a tural and a rtificia l cuts in the
midden deposits indica ted about th e sa m e frequen cy and distribution
of large l and mammal bone as had been previousl y noted for w estern
Wa shing ton.

The Gulf of Georgia and the Puget Sound area were both occupied,
during the contact period, by coastal Salish groups who were remarkably similar in socio-political organization and in econom y . Furthermore, these groups appeared to early investigators, and appear to
ethnologists today, to have been in possession of the area for a relatively long period of time. The physical environment of the two areas
is strikingly similar and they are contiguous. However, Mooney's
population estimates for the y ear 1780 show 23,700 inhabitants of the
Gulf of Georgia area and 6,000 inhabitants of the Puget Sound area.
Kroeber ( 1939: 142) computes that this yields a population density of
32.60 in the Gulf of Georgia area and 16.80 in the Puget Sound area
per one hundred square kilometers. The evidence of archeological survey and test excavation strongly supports Kroeber's objection that the
Puget Sound Salish have been underestimated.
Finally we turn to Kroeber's suggestion that the Nutka, Kwakiutl,
Tsimshian, and Haida have, perhaps, been underestimated relative to
population estimates for the Gulf of Georgia Salish. Here the author
has relatively little comment to make. He has done no field work in
the Tsimshian and Haida areas. An archeological survey of eastern
Vancouver Island in 1954 (Taylor, 1956; Taylor and Duff, 1956 ) and
a trip round the west coast of Vancouver Island in 1959 (Taylor,
1961 ), leads him to the view that Kroeber was right- at least for the
Nutka and Kwakiutl areas. While the incidence of village sites is much
lower, it is also true that northern villages appear to be much larger.

Ethnohistorical Data Bearing on Aboriginal Southern
Northwest Coast Population Estimates
Kwakiutl. The total of 9,376 for the Kwakiutl population of Vancouver Island and adjacent small islands in and around Johnstone
Strait is taken from two censuses (one for the west coast of Vancouver
Island and one for the east coast) in the papers of Sir James Douglas. 3
Sir James lists a population of 920 for the Quatsino on the west coast
of Vancouver Island, 4,454 for the "Quakeeolth," and 4,002 for the
"Lay- 'coolaach at Point Mudge and other parts of Johnstone Straits"
(slave population included in each case).
Neither census is dated. The east coast census must have been taken
after 1840, since the Lekwiltok are shown in possession of Cape Mudge
and a Salishan-speaking group held that spot until that time (Taylor
and Duff, 1956). It is unlikely that this series of censuses was undertaken after 1846 for a variety of reasons. It seems probable that the
west coast census dates from about the same time as the east coast census. The writer is therefore inclined to set the dates 1840-6 for this
population figure.
Thus the censuses of the mid-nineteenth century show more than
twice as many Kwakiutl as Mooney estimated for 1780. Both figures
exclude the Haisla; however, the Hudson's Bay census rolls, evidently,
also do not include the Heiltsuk of the adjacent British Columbia
mainland.
The three most ready explanations for this discrepancy would
appear to be:
a. The Kwakiutl population doubled or even tripled, in the space of two
generations, between 1780 and 1845.
b . The censuses of Sir James Douglas are wildly inaccurate.
c. Mooney vastly underestimated the Kwakiutl population c. 1780.

The first explanation is quite unsatisfactory for several reasons. We

The library catalog card notes that the First Series of Papers were copied from the
Victoria (British Columbia) Provincial Archives; the whereabouts of the originals
of the Second Series are unknown. To this the present writer would note that at
least several of the papers of the "Second Series" are in the archives in Victoria.
In at least one instance a clerical ( ?) error on a census in the Vi ctoria collection
appears also in the Bancroft Collection census but does not appear on the copy in
Beaver House, London. The writer therefore suspects that the Second Series was
also copied from the Victoria Archives. In truth, the Second Series is not a series
but a hodgepodge of Sir James' papers oovering almost two decades.

do not know of a North American Indian group which increased in
population during the first two or three generations after white contact. (Mooney, himself [in Hodge, 1910, Pt. 2: 286], makes this point
quite emphatically. ) In any event, smallpox and syphilis had begun
their work among the Kwakiutl by the end of the eighteenth centuryalbeit somewhat less virulently, one may assume from the documentary evidence, than the ravages of these diseases to the south. It is quite
likely that the territorial expansion of the Kwakiutl (at least the Lekwiltok), together with their increasingly aggressive and successful
slave raids, had led to a rapid rise of the slave population. Since Hudson's Bay officials always enumerated slaves (usually separately, but
in this instance, in lump ) this factor probably caused "Kwakiutl" population figures to decline less rapidly than their neighbors, but it can

130

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

scarcely have given rise to a phenomenal population increase. In order
to assume that an increase in slaves accounts for the discrepancy in the
two sets of figures we would be forced to the hypothesis that the Kwakiutl had more slaves than freemen. No case is known in which much
more than a quarter of the population of any tribe on the Northwest
Coast was slave. The Northwest Coast economy could have supported
no such distribution of population.
The contest then becomes one between acceptance of Mooney's estimates made from secondary sources three generations after the event
and the Hudson's Bay Company head count made on the scene. Unless
evidence can be adduced proving inaccuracy, willful or careless, on the
part of the Hudson's Bay enumerators, it would appear necessary to
accept the third explanation- viz., Mooney vastly underestimated the
Kwakiutl population c. 1780.
Southern Central Maritime. The Nutkan population figure of 7,093
is taken from the previously mentioned west coast Vancouver Island
census and thus probably dates from the early 1840's. 4 The census figures give breakdowns for men, women, boys, and girls. While the
Kwakiutl have a nearly normal distribution, the children's figures, of
both sexes, among the Nutka are very low- arguing, inferentially,
that in preceding generations the total Nutkan population figure must
have been much higher.
The discrepancy between Mooney's figures and those of Douglas are
not as great as the discrepancy in Kwakiutl figures (amounting to less
than twenty per cent ) . However, it must be remembered that Mooney's estimates date from nearly three generations earlier than the Hudson's Bay census. Since the child-adult ratio of the census constitutes
mute evidence to the rapid decline of Nutkan population and since the
Nutka were the first groups in contact with the white man on the
Northwest Coast, we probably must multiply the census figures by a
factor of two or three to arrive at a valid extrapolation based upon
Douglas' 1840-46 figure. This would indicate a Nutka population on
the order of 17,700 c. 1780.
If the Hudson's Bay census is assumed accurate, then Mooney's
estimate for 1780 must be much too low.

of Vancouver Island. The figure 8,900 was not taken from Kroeber,
since he does not break down population for mainland and Vancouver
Island British Columbia Salishan. This 8,900 represents the total of all
the Vancouver Island Salish groups listed in Mooney's 1928 article. 5
Mooney's (1928: 28) estimate and the Hudson's Bay count are at
this point strikingly similar. However, it must, once again, be remembered that Mooney's figures are for 1780. The Hudson's Bay censuses
for this group were probably made c. 1840. Since the northern Coast
Salish had suffered population loss from at least three sources during
this period (disease, slave raids, and Kwakiutl [Lekwiltok] territorial
aggrandizement in the north), it is scarcely reasonable to assume that
population in 1780 on eastern Vancouver Island should be slightly
lower than for 1840. Once again, Mooney's estimate for 1780 would
appear to be low, although, in this instance, somewhat nearer the
mark.
Nutsak, Lummi. At this point, there is a curious difference between
Mooney's figures and those of Kroeber. Mooney gives a total of 1,000
for Nooksak, Lummi and Samish. Kroeber gives a total of 800 for the
"Nutsak" and Lummi alone. Since Kroeber's total figure for the Gulf
of Georgia group is 200 below that of Mooney and his total figure for
the Puget Sound area is 200 above Mooney's estimate, the writer has
assumed that Kroeber allowed a population of 200 for the Samish and
arbitrarily assigned them to the Puget Sound area-which is something of a geographic tour de force. Possibly Kroeber decided to lump
the Samish with the Skagit-a reasonably defensible position.
The figure 855 for the Nooksack and Lummi in the Hudson's Bay
census column is taken from the papers of Sir James Douglas (in which
the tribal designations are given as "Eusakk" and "Nholumie"). This
census (Douglas, 1853: 10-11) was very likely made after 1840-possibly as late as 1846 or 1847. Chart 3 is a section of this report and is
given here to illustrate the manner in which Hudson's Bay censuses
were returned on the Northwest Coast.
Once again, the actual count for a year in the 1840's is higher (in
this case by only about six per cent) than Mooney's estimate for 1780.
And, therefore, we must once more conclude that if the Hudson's Bay
census is correct, then Mooney's estimate is too low.
Klallam, Chimakum. The estimate of 2,400 for the 1780 population
of the Klallam and Chimakum contrasts with the Hudson's Bay census
''Douglas, 1853: 7. Douglas actually shows a total of 9.404 Salishan Indians on
eastern Vancouver Island; however, he (or a clerk ) made an error of 10 in adding
the adult female column. VVhen corrected, the total is 9,414.

report of c. 1845." This report seems to have been prepared at Fort
Victoria and therefore must have been done in the middle or late
1840's. Granted the notation that two "tribes" are missing from this
return and also granted that the Hudson's Bay reports make no mention of Chimakum (who were probably absorbed by the KlallamHudson's Bay reports note the Klallam around Port Townsend) , the
two figures appear reasonably compatible. Smallpox had been reported
on the south coast of the Strait of Juan de Fuca as early as 1792-on
the other hand, contemporary accounts do not appear to justify an assumption that their population decline was extraordinary for the
Northwest Coast. If we assume a population decrease of fifty per cent
from 1780 to 1845, then Mooney's estimate would appear to be quite
accurate.
Puget Sound Salish. The figure 5,175 in the Hudson's Bay census
column was obtained by subtracting from the Fort Nisqualli District
census of 1838-1839, the total for the Klallam and adding to the remainder the total for the Skagit (drawn from the HBC census mentioned in the section on the Nutsak and Lummi). 7
In another manuscript (Taylor, 1961) the writer has given his
opinion that the population of the Puget Sound area declined about
fifty per cent in the period from 1780 to 1840. He therefore thinks that
the figure for 1780 should be approximately 10,300 rather than Mooney's estimate of 6,000. In any event, it is difficult to reconcile a figure of
G Douglas, 1853: 14--15. The Hudson's Bay census for the Fort Nisqualli District for the year 1838-1839 showed a population of only 1262 Klallam. However,
it is relatively unlikely that this census included the westernmost Klallam groups.
7 The Fort Nisqualli census of 1838-39 here employed was furnish ed the writer
by the Governor and Committee of the Hudson's Bay Company from the archives
in Bea ver House, London. A copy is to be found on pp. 19-20 of the Private Papers
of Sir lames Douglas, Ms., (Second Series) , Victoria, B.C. A probable copy of this
copy is to be found on p. 23 of Douglas, op. cit. Both of the latter copies contain the
identical clerical error.

6,000 for 1780 with an actual head count of 5,175 in 1839, when we
know that the Puget Sound natives had been repeatedly visited by
smallpox and syphilis was rampant among them. Evidently, the "intermitting fever" did not reach Puget Sound (Tolmie, 1883, under date
of Thursday, Nov. 14).
Tlatskanai. Of all the contrasted figures in Chart 2 the greatest proportional discrepancy is that between Mooney's estimate of 1,600
Tlatskanai for the year 1780 and Sir George Simpson's (in Merk,
1931: 170 ) estimate of 175 "Clatskaneyes" extant in 1825. It is quite
difficult to understand why Mooney gave such a large figure for the
Tlatskanai. After all they were an hunting and gathering Athabascanspeaking people, comparable in every way to their relatives the Owilapash. Each group was essentially alien to the Northwest Coast cultural
pattern; each group occupied a bloc of rough hill country (the two
areas were quite comparable in size) that was non-utilizable to the
Chinookan and Salishan groups around them. Yet Mooney lumps the
Owilapash together with three much larger Salishan tribes and assigns them a combined weight of 1,200 in contrast to the Tlatskanai's
1,600!
Probably, Mooney relied upon the Lewis and Clark estimate of
1,200 "Clack-star Nation" in 1805, and added one-third for presumed
population decrease in the quarter century between 1780 and the
Lewis and Clark vi~its. However, as Thwaites points out, this estimate
was "considerably enlarged" by William Clark after the Lewis and
Clark expedition had returned from the West Coast. In general, the
Lewis and Clark estimates for the areas they did not reside in are suspiciously large compared to their conservative estimates for the bands
they knew well (such as the Clatsop and Chinook.) 8
The Hudson's Bay report (Sir George calls it a rough estimate. although it includes a breakdown by sex for freemen and slaves ) is for
the year 1824-25 and thus predates the great "intermittent fever"
epidemics which began either in 1829 or 1830.
Granted that the Tlatskanai, along with the Chinook and Owilapash , were to all but vanish before the middle of the nineteenth century, there does not seem to be much evidence that they had suffered
much more than other southern Northwest Coast Indian s prior to 1825,
and probably had not suffered as much as tl1e Nutka .
The writer thinks an estimate of 400 for the Tlatskanai in 1780
more realistic than Mooney' s 1,600.

Lower, Upper Chehalis, Owilapash, Cowlitz . The writer was unable
to locate Hudson's Bay census data for the Lower Chehalis, Upper Chehalis and Cowlitz. It can be observed, however, that Mooney's composite estimate of 1,000 for 1780 is amazingly low compared to his
estimate of 22,000 for the Chinook and 1,600 for the Tlatskanai.
(Mooney estimates the Athabascan Owilapash [Willapa] at 200, Kroeber lumps them with the Chehalis and Cowlitz for his figure of 1,200. )
Before the intermittent fever epidemic, the Cowlitz were reckoned a
large tribe by Hudson's Bay Company officials. For example, Sir
George Simpson says :
'iVhen I descended the Cowlitz, in 1828, there was a large population
along its banks; but since then the intermittent fever, which commenced
its ravages in the following year, had left but fe w to mourn for those that
fell. During the whole of our day's course, till we came upon a small camp
in the evening, th e shores w ere silent and solitary, the deserted villages
forming melancholy monuments of th e generation that h ad passed away. n

Sir James Douglas noted:
The inhabitants of the Cowlitz River were a t one tim e numerous; but
are now reduced to som ething l ess than 60 men principally occupied in
fishing: few of them evincing a desire to becom e hunters by courting the
noble el evating and more arduous exercises of th e chase.
The decrease of population cannot be clearly traced to any one cause
in parti cular- it with more probability proceeds from a union of evils.
The whites best acquainted with the former and present state of the River
and the Natives themselves, however, ascribe it with one voice to the
Ague. As it is only since the appeara nce of that incredibly destructive
visitation among them tha t they have wasted a way to a shadow of their
former numbers.

ESTIMATING ABORIGINAL POPULATION

135

Counting women and children, the population of the Cowlitz c. 1840
may, therefore, be reckoned at 150 to 200. In fact, most reports of the
late 1840's and early 1850's written by British and American officials
other than Hudson's Bay Company show a larger population for the
Cowlitz. Sterling's estimate for 1852 was 200. Warre and Vavaseur's
report (returned in the House of Commons in the spring of 1849 )
showed a population of 500-but this probably included Taidnapam.
Assuming the death toll in the preceding decade to have amounted
to three-quarters of the population (a conservative estimate in the light
of the foregoing statements and John McLoughlin's estimate that in
the fint fever year of 1830, three-quarters of the Chinook in the vicinity of Fort Vancouver died in one summer), then the Cowlitz population of 1830 was on the order of 600 to 800. Assuming about the
same decrease for the Cowlitz for the period 1780-1830 as that adopted
for the Puget Sound tribes, then the population in 1780 would have
been on the order of 900-1200 in that latter year.
This checks rather well with Edward Curtis' description of eleven
villages of Cowlitz on the Cowlitz River. It should be remembered that
permanent villages became more numerous and individually smaller
as one proceeds south on the Northwest Coast, and that riverine economy would not support so large a village as would a maritime economy.
The Owilapash would have been a much smaller group-as an Athabascan hunting and gathering people occupying about the same type
and amount of land as the Tlatskanai, it would appear likely that they
had approximately the same population- about 400 c. 1780.
The Upper Chehalis were probably a smaller group than the Cowlitz
in 1780. Dart shows a population of 204 for the year 1851-but he evidently added the livestock into the total population figure (and added
wrongly to boot). The writer thinks that an estimate of 500 Upper
Chehalis for the year 1780 would not be too wide of the mark.
Concerning the Lower Chehalis (including the Copalis and the
Humptulips) it need only be noted that they were not enumerated at
all before the epidemics of the 1830's hit them and that they occupied
the shores of Gray's Harbor and northern Willapa Bay. This area includes some of the largest archaeological sites south of the Gulf of
Georgia-the population was reported to be numerous by John Work
on his original exploratory expedition of 1824. The writer is inclined
to estimate a population on the order of 1,800-2,400 for 1780.
Adding these estimates together, 4,000 is suggested as a more reliable estimate for the total group than Mooney's 1,200.
Chinook. Mooney gives a population of 22,000 for the Chinook on

the lower Columbia in the year 1780. It will be noted that this figure is
a little larger than Mooney's estimate for the population of the whole
of the Gulf of Georgia region and represents approximately one-fifth
of his total for the Northwest Coast. 11 Sir George Simpson (in Merk,
1931: 170) gave a "rough estimate of the population on the Columbia
River from the Coast to the Cascade Portage as far as the influence of
the Tide is felt" for the year 1824-5. He listed 1, 140 free males, 950
free females , 395 male slaves and 275 female slaves for a total population of 2,760. This figure included 175 "Clatskaneyes." If we deduct
the Tlatskanais from the total, we have an estimated 2,585 Chinooks
resident on the lower Columbia in 1824--5. The discrepancy is, of
course, remarkable. Now a whole host of commentators, British,
French, and American, have remarked upon the rapid depopulation of
the Chinook in the 1830's due primarily to the ravages of "intermittent
fever." 12 Captain Wilkes' (in Gibbs, 1855: 435) estimate of population
of the lower Columbia in 1841 comes to only 519 and doubtless includes some non-Chinook groups. He lists only 219 under the heading
Chinook. Gibbs ( 1855: 435 ) shows for 1854 a total Chinook population
below the Cowlitz, and including the Chinook of Shoalwater Bay (Willa pa Bay) , of 116, noting that they are intermingled with the Cowlitz
and Chehalis.
The conclusion is inescapable from contemporary accounts and from
censuses that the Chinook virtually ceased to exist in the two decades
following the first appearance of "intermitent fever" at Fort Vancouver in 1830 (it is an almost overpowering temptation to observe in
modern vernacular that they were "decimated by over nine-tenths" ).
However, this demonstrable population reduction occurred after Simpson's estimate of 2,585 in 1824--25. It does not, at least at first blush,
aid us in understanding why Mooney gives a population figure nine
times greater than Sir George's 1824-25 estimate for the year 1780.
Normally, Sir George Simpson, in common with other west coast Hudson's Bay officials, was careful to note any sudden change in population figures. He makes no mention of a marked population decrease
precedent to his 1824-25 estimate.
If the reader will consult the bibliography of Mooney appended to
his 1928 publication he will note that only published standard works
on early Northwest Coast settlement printed before 1910 were cited.

ESTIMATING ABORIGINAL POPULATION

137

Several of these works estimate Chinook population decrease at between nine-tenths and eleven-twelfths without being very specific
about the base from whence they extrapolated.
Smallpox and syphilis had almost certainly appeared at the mouth
of the Columbia before the end of the eighteenth century. 1 3 However,
we know, or may infer, that smallpox had appeared at various other
points on the Northwest Coast at about this same time.
To sum up: the writer doubts that population decrease on the lower
Columbia was too much greater than that elsewhere on the Northwest
Coast before the mouth of the Columbia became the locus of western
European contact. The term "too much greater" is here used advisedly.
The Columbia and the Fraser served as aboriginal trade arteries and it
is quite probable that epidemics in advance of western European contact reached such areas with greater frequency than they did such
backwaters as the Puget Sound area or the Willamette Valley. Certainly, however, there is no evidence to support the view that the population of the Chinook area decreased by ten times while the population of the Puget Sound area remained constant and the population
of the west coast of Vancouver Island increased between 1 780 and
1830. Most of the observers who wrote the works Mooney consulted
visited Fort Vancouver in the late 1830's or during the 1840's and were
regaled with tales of depopulation in that area due to the current intermittent fever epidemics. These they printed and did not mention the
population in other areas from the Northwest Coast because they did
not have contact with these areas. Mooney therefore assumed an enormously greater rate of depopulation in the late eighteenth century and
early nineteenth century for this region than for others on the Northwest Coast.
If we accept Simpson's estimate for 1824-25 and assume a population decrease twice as great for the lower Columbia area than that assumed for Puget Sound from 1780 to 1840, we may estimate the Chinook population at 5,000 circa 1780. 14

upon the material, here presented, as contrasted with those of Mooney,
for the year 1 780 (Chart 4 ).
In 1939, Kroeber observed in the course of his population density
studies that:
V\That is needed is, first a generally accepted classification of tribes or
ethnic groups; second, a more precise determination of their territories;
and third, a new series of estimates, both by local specialists and by those
interested in demographic problems as such, of the size of tribal populations. These studies will probably involve a number of workers and a
number of years. Only then can anything like reasonable reliability in
detail be expected .

The present writer would not pretend that this paper represents such
a step for the southern Northwest Coast, but does venture the hope
that it is a way-station toward reliable estimates.
In conclusion, the writer wishes to observe, that while Mooney's
figures for the southern Northwest Coast were in many instances quite
wide of the mark, considering the time at which he wrote, the preliminary character of his study, and the scanty materials available to
him, he did a remarkably creditable job.
Even more remarkable were Kroeber's trenchant comments upon
Mooney's figures for the southern Northvvest Coast-which would
seem in most instances to be admirably borne out by the data.

While pausing to admire, however, we should not lose sight of the
fact that Mooney's estimates, at least for this region, are not the best in
the light of available data-and Kroeber's population density figures
are based upon Mooney's estimates.
Finally, the writer ventures to point out that it might be fruitful if

Kroeber's density figures for other culture areas.
