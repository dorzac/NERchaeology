Post West Bernard (41WH16) - Republic of Texas
Armory, 1837-1839, Wharton County, Texas
Joe D. Hudgins

ABSTRACT
Post West Bemard was one of the major ordnance depots for the
Republic of Texas Army from 1837 to 1839. Initial surface collections
and later excavations yielded more than 2,000 artifacts, most of which
apparently represent the residue of f’trearrns refurbishing.

INTRODUCTION
The Post West Bernard site is in Wharton County about 6 km (4 miles) west of
Hungerford, near a spring about 69 m (75 yards) west of the present channel of the
West Bernard River. This site, recorded as 41WH16 with the Texas Archeologieal
Research Laboratory at the Balcones Research Laboratory of The University of
Texas in Austin, is in a cultivated field, so the artifacts were exposed on the surface.
Initial surface collecting was done by the writer, who took note of the heaviest concentrations of various types of artifacts.
Cultivation of the site area was to be continued, so the writer, with the consent
of the landowner and the farmer, asked the Houston Archaeological Society to survey the site further and salvage the remaining artifacts. The site was mapped, and a
grid of 5-meter squares was set up covering the roughly rectangular area in which
artifacts were found (Figure 1). A systematic search for metal artifacts was made
using a metal detector; they and nonmetal artifacts such as fragments of glass, ceramics, and gun flints, were plotted on the grid, and each was recorded, bagged, and
labeled. Artifact distribution plans (Figures 7-11) were made, but vertical placement of the artifacts was not recorded, since all were found in the disturbed plow
zone.
The metal artifacts were taken to the Department of Nautical Archeology at
Texas A&M University in College Station, where they were treated by electrolysis
to prevent further oxidation. They were photographed before and after cleaning,
then they were cataloged and identified (Hudgins 1984).
HISTORY
Post West Bernard was established soon after the mass furlough of the troops at
Camp Bowie in May and June of 1837. Much of the army’s ordnance and military
stores were apparently taken to this small outpost. Lt. H. L. Gush commanded about
two dozen men of the Permanent Volunteers in 1838 and 1839. As late as January
1839, sheds were built to protect the artillery. Lt. Gush was ordered to discharge the
Permanent Volunteers as soon as they could be replaced by the new First Infantry,
commanded by Capt. Martin K. Snell (Pierce 1969:179).

Information concerning military camps and outposts of the Texas Army is
scarce. Many of the small outposts existed for only a short time, and very little has
been recorded concerning the duties of the men who garrisoned them pierce 1984).
However, insight into the living conditions and some information about the location
of Post West Bernard were revealed in the following letter from Thomas Anderson,
a medical officer stationed at the post, to Ashbel Smith, Surgeon General of the
Texas Army (Briggs 1983).
West Bernard Station
June 12, 1838
To Ashbel Smith, M.D.
Surgeon Genl. T. A.
My Dear Sir,
You will no doubt be somewhat surprised to received my letter of resignation so soon aftermy arrival at this Post. I assure you sir it is no small degree
of reluctance that I solicit its acceptance. It has never been my wish to leave
the service nor would I do so, could I remain with the slightest comfort to
myself or without doing very great violence to my feelings. Our Station is in
a perfect wilderness, some five or six miles from any human habitation, we
have but five men and they are all on duty, consequently I am forced to bring
my own wood and water, make my own fire and cook my own meals in the hot
sun without a shelter to protect me from the weather and no place to sleep but
in the open air, we are eight miles from a post office and thus I am cutt off from
all communications with my friends here or in the U.S. All this I could bear
had I books to read but there is not one I presume within twenty miles of us.
I dislike very much sir, to admit the foregoing reasons as the cause of my
desire to leave the service, a soldier should never compain of such things and
did I conceive that there was the slightest necessity for it, I would remain
without a murmur.
Could I be removed to any other station, I would still be plaeased to retain
my commission, or should this station be removed to any other point, I will
have no objection to remain, but under existing circumstances, I hope sir, that
you will relieve me.
Most Respectfully your friend,
[signed] Ths. P. Anderson

Anderson’s complaint that the post is "eight miles from a post office" is an
important clue to the location of the post. The nearest post office in the summer of
1838 was at Egypt, Texas (Williams 1972:31). The small community of Egypt
exists today 7.5 miles west of the site of Post West Bernard. There is no description
available of the duties of the five men stationed at the post with Anderson.
Orders dated as late as 1839 indicated that wagoneers were making trips between Houston and Post West Bernard carrying ordnance to the new armory at
Houston. On April 22, 1839 a shipment of muskets was delivered by W. T. C. Pierce
from Post West Bernard to Houston. On April 26 Pierce delivered about 5,461 lbs.

146

of ordnance from Post West Bernard to Houston, and on May 4, two howitzers, two
iron cannon, and one brass cannon (Williams 1984). No other orders from the post
have been found and, considering the amount of ordnance shipped to the Houston
armory, it is probable, although no official record of the closing has been found, that
the armory at Post West Bernard was no longer in existence after 1839.
The arms at the Post West Bemard armory came from several sources. The U.S.
Government shipped 440 flintlock muskets into Texas from New Orleans in 1836,
and the Texians captured 200 muskets from the Mexicans a year earlier during the
Goliad and San Antonio campaigns of 1835 (Gilbert 1971). Personal arms such as
flintlock muskets, rifles, pistols, and shotguns arrived with volunteer units coming
to Texas, but most of the weapons by far were captured from the Mexican Army at
the Battle of San Jacinto (Koury 1973:8).
In October 1838, the Republic of Texas’s military stores consisted of the following items located at Houston, Galveston, and Post West Bernard: 25 cannons
(both fit and unfit for service), two howitzers, one mortar, 992 cannon balls, 110
shells, 988 complete muskets, 440 muskets needing repair, 129 muskets unfit for
service, seven rifles, musket balls, powder, bayonts, and other military equipment.
At Post West Bernard there were 653 muskets described as out of order (Nance
1963:44).
Records of arms purchased by the Mexican Government have not been found,
but one Mexican weapon of that period was the .75 caliber Indian Pattern Brown
Bess musket marked with the eagle and snake of Mexico. This weapon was made for
the British East India Co. until 1815. In 1833, British Ordnance had 440,000 India
Pattern arms, of which 176,000 were still serviceable. It was, however, no longer the
standard weapon, and it is likely that unless the British considered these muskets
outmoded, they would not have sold so many of them (Koury 1973:8). However,
Wilson (1985) points out that no contracts for arms sales between the British and
Mexican governments have been found, and it is therefore more likely that the
British muskets were supplied to the Mexican government by Birmingham gunmakers and contractors, who had also supplied the British government with muskets. Although the India Pattern muskets were undoubtedly the most readily available at the time, several other flintlock British Brown Bess models that were made
from 1715 to 1815 would have been considered surplus. These were the Pre-Land
Pattern and New Land Pattern (Bailey 1971:13).
Information is vague concerning the models of U.S. flintlock muskets shipped
into Texas between 1836 and 1840, and also about the various models of private
muskets, pistols, and shotguns brought in by volunteers. Before this time the U.S.
Government was manufacturing several models of flintlock muskets that would
have been available to the Texas Army. These include models 1795, 1798, 1808,
1812, and 1816, type I & II, all .69 caliber (Gluckman 1965:37).
The first U.S. Government contract with a private gunsmith to produce flintlock pistols was in 1799. The .69 caliber pistols were based on the French Army’s
model 1777. In 1805 a .54 caliber horseman’s pistol was produced by the National
Armory at Harpers Ferry, and in 1819 the U.S. Ordnance Department contracted for
20,000 pistols to be patterned after an English type (Hicks 1968:19-22). Kentucky

Hudgins ~ Post West Bernard

flintlock pistols were also available in .44 and .48 caliber sizes (Chapel 1961:24).
Rifles produced in the United States after 1700 were .54 caliber; some of the models
were the Kentucky rifle,U.S, model 1817, and the U.S. model 1819. The 1819 model
rifle, known as Hall’s rifle, was .52 caliber. The armory at Harpers Ferry was also
directed to produce a model 1803 rifle (Hicks 1968:19-22).

MILITARY ARTIFACTS
Most of the artifacts found at the Post West Bernard site were iron or brass gun
parts from British and U.S. flintlock arms (Crowley and Brezik 1985).
The most difficult gun parts to identify as to type or model were the lock plates.
Models of both the U.S. and foreigh muskets were identified from the shields,
letters, or numbers stamped in the centers of the lock plates under the flash pans and
on the tails of the lock plates behind the hammers (Darling 1931 :Figure 37; Gluckman 1965:Plate 1). Due to their exposure to the elements on or near the surface for
about 150 years, no markings could be seen on any of the lock plates found at Post
West Bernard; identifications had to be made by comparing lock plates from the site
with present-day lock plates, and from photographs and drawings of flintlock arms.
Only one of the 31 lock plates found at the site was complete. The degree of
competeness of these lock plates shows how much repair work and cannibalization
would havebeennecessary to refurbish these arms (Hudgins 1985a) (Table 1).

one or more mechanisms; D, unreinforced hammer from an early India Pattern or Long Land
Pattern British musket missing cap and cap screw; E, reinforced hammer from India Pattern

Most of the lock plates (65 percent) were from British muskets (primarily the India
Pattern) (Figure 2, A-C); lock plates from U.S. muskets accounted for 25 percent of
the total. These include models 1795, 1798, 1808, 1812, and 1816. Two lock plates
from pistols and two from shotguns were also found at the site. British and United
S tares flintlock arms manufactured in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries had basically the same working mechanisms (Figures 3, 4).
Detached lock plate mechanisms and parts from various arms were found in
abundance (Hudgins 1985a, 1985b), together with detached hammers from both
U.S. and British arms. Fifteen hammers from British Brown Bess muskets were of
the reinforced design ("ring-necked cock," Figure 2, E) typical of the India Pattern
made after 1809. Seven hammers were the older, unreinforced variety (swan-neck
cock, Figure 2, D), but since the cap screws were missing on all seven, it was difficult
to tell whether they were from the early India Pattern made before 1809 or from the
even older Long Land Pattern musket. Hammers from a U.S. model 1812 musket
and a U.S. model 1816 musket were also found together with two hammers from
shotguns and two from nonmilitary rifles. Frizzens were also found from a variety
of arms: five from the British Brown Bess musket, one from a U.S. model 1808
musket, three from the U.S. model 1816 musket, five from the U.S. model 1812
musket, and three smaller frizzens from nonmilitary arms. Preservation of lock
plate mechanisms such as sears, sear springs, tumblers, bridles, main springs, and
frizzen springs was poor, and no identification as to model could be made.
Other gun parts found at the site include 25 sling swivels, eight butt plates, 12

side plates, 32 rampipes, nine nose caps, 65 trigger guards and trigger guard fragments, three breech plugs, and five bayonet fragments. The brass trigger guards,
brass rampipes, and nose caps from the British muskets were the most altered or
damaged of all the gun parts (Figure 5). Most of the trigger guards had both front and
rear tangs removed. Some had been cut and hammered, and several tangs were
partially melted (Figure 4). Most were from the India Pattern Brown Bess musket,
but two were from U.S. arms: one from a U.S. model 1803 Harpers Ferry rifle, the
other from a U.S. model 1805 pistol (Figure 6). The rampipes and nose caps were all
from the India Pattern British musket. Most of the butt plates and side plates were
also from the India Pattern British Brown Bess musket, with the only exceptions a
butt plate from a U.S. model 1803 Harpers Ferry rifle and a side plate from a New
Land Pattern British musket.
More than half of the brass rampipes and the trigger guard tangs from British
India Pattern muskets were incised with Roman numerals. These numerals are
identification marks put on in storage when the gun parts were collected to be

mounted together as firearms (Wilson 1985). Several gun parts were stamped or
engraved with contractors’ marks representing individual companies or private
contractors who made musket parts for the British ordnance (Wilson 1985). For
example, a side plate was stamped with the letter B; a terminal rampipe was stamped
C on the tang; the tang of a butt plate was engraved with a rack number, 1456.
Darling (1931) notes that rack numbers occasionally were engraved on the buttplate tangs of India Pattern muskets made by private contractors. One side plate
found at the site was stamped with a short, flaring arrow, one of several used by the
British to signify government ownership (Darling 1931). Another side plate had
punctation marks that formed the letter A (Figure 3, A). This is not typical of
identification marks on British military firearms; they were probably added in
Mexico or in Texas (Wilson 1985).
Two of the three barrel fragments were from .75 caliber British muskets. One
barrel (breech plug in place) was cut in half and bent at a 10° angle. The other British

a rectangle with a small hole through the center. The remaining barrel fragment was

sawing (Briggs n.d.).

of gun parts. By Richard L. Gregg.

Most of the sling swivels were from British muskets. Many of were broken and
without swivel pins. Front and rear sling swivels from U.S. muskets werealso found,
some of the front swivels with parts of the barrel bands attached.
All of the lock plates and most of the brass furnishings were found in one small
area of the site (Figure 1). Smaller gun parts--lock-plate mechanisms and sling
swivels--were found over a larger area (Figure 7), but there were none in the
northwestern part of the site where the heaviest concentration of gun parts was found
(Figure 1).
Evidence of bullet manufacturing at the post came with the discovery of an iron
lead-dipper, tongs, dipper handles, melted lead, melted brass, rolled lead, rectangu-

lar lead bars, and 24 lead musket shot ~igure 8). Thirteen lead musket shot were
.69 caliber, three were .75 caliber, and six, smaller than .69 caliber, were distorted
to some extent and, although difficult to measure, appear to be .52 or .54 caliber.
Several lead shot of different calibers had been flattened from impact. Iron and brass
shot were also found: three iron shot were 1 inch and three were 1.5 inches in
diameter; four brass shot were 1 inch and two were 1.25 inches in diameter.
NONMILITARY ARTIFACTS
Seventy ceramic sherds and 44 fragments of glass were collected from the
surface. These artifacts, found throughout the site, were concentrated in the
southern area ~igures 1, 9, 10). The entire collection of ceramics apI~ars to be of

the Regency period (1810-1830) and none appear to be of the post- 1837 Victorian
era. During the early years of the Texas Republic the army did not issue mess kits,
therefore these sherds may represent dinnerware that was used by the men at the post
(Briggs n.d.).
Preliminary analysis of the glass fragments was based on the necks and bases
of wine, ale, or spirit bottles (’vVetze11985). Further analysis of the glass fragments
is in progress to determine if they are from the same time period as the ceramics.
Several brass buttons (Figure 10) from men’s clothing and fragments of a brass
spur were recovered (Hudgins 1985c). Other personal items such as pocket-knife

fragments and a brass thimble were found at the north end of the site.
More than 600 square nails and spikes were scattered over most of the site, but
due to extensive oxidation, only fragments remain, making it difficult to determine
accurately their exact sizes or types. The nails may have come from the structure
that was erected in 1839 to protect the artillery. Two areas of the site have the
heaviest concentrations of nails: one is the area that yielded most of the gun parts;
the other is at the south end of the site and may represent an additional structure
(Figure 11).

Figure 11. Plan of gridded part of the Post West Bernard site (41WH 16), showing locations
of nails. By Richard L. Gregg.

An iron object (Figure 12) that appears to be an ox goad (Taylor 1986) was
found in the part of the site that had the heaviest concentration of gun parts (Figure
1). It is 20 cm (8 inches) long and has a conical base that tapers to a square-sectioned
point or handle.
There were several iron and brass artifacts that could not be identified
positively. Most were simply pieces of irregularly shaped metal, but some are
interesting enough to warrant further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
Historical records indicate that Post West Bernard served as the armory for the
Republic of Texas Army from 1837 to 1839. Documents concerning the armory
indicate that it consisted of personal weapons brought to Texas by volunteers from
surrounding states and included flintlock muskets supplied by the U.S. Government, but most of the weapons were captured Mexican arms from the Goliad and
San Antonio campaigns of 1835 andtheBattleofSan Jacintoin 1836. TheMexican
army was thought to have been armed primarily with surplus British flintlock
muskets, and the predominance (65 percent) of parts from British muskets found on
the site supports this view.
Gun parts such as lock plates in various stages of assembly and lock plate
mechanisms that are apparently results of cannibalizing (Blaine 1980), together
with a sawed rifle muzzle, two cut and reworked musket barrels, and tools indicate
that gunsmith work, of the kind required to refurbish the arms, was being done.
The predominance of broken, cut, and melted brass from the furniture of the
British muskets may indicate that many of these muskets were damaged beyond
repair and that the brass parts were being removed and used for scrap metal. In fact
the brass shot found at the site may have been made from these parts.
No records of daily activities and duties of the soldiers stationed at Post West
Bernard have been found, but Anderson’s letter stating that all five men stationed
at the post in 1838 were on duty and not available for routine orderly duties raises
the possibility that they could have been involved in reconditioning arms. Documents in the Texas Archives show that a wagonload of muskets and large amounts
of ordnance were being shipped from Post West Bernard to the armory at Houston
in 1839 (Williams 1984), adding further to the evidence that the men at Post West
Bernard were reconditioning arms.
The existence of such a large number of flintlock gun parts, together with
evidence from correspondence in the Texas Archives (Brigg 1983; Williams 1984),
strongly suggests that 4 lWH16 is indeed the site of the Post West Bernard armory.
Work continues at the site in the seasons when the area is not under cultivation.
The Wharton County Historical Museum in Wharton, Texas will be the curator of
all artifacts from the site.
