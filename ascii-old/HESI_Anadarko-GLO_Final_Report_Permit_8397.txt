MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the 2018 calendar year, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted intensive cultural resources surveys for eight proposed Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation (Anadarko) projects located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Areas). These projects included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs). All eight projects were privately funded and did not
require any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the GLO is considered to be a
political subdivision of the State of Texas, the portions of the eight projects on GLO property all
fell under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton
Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources surveys of the Project Areas
on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. Overall, these surveys assessed
approximately 23.7 acres of GLO land. The purpose of the surveys was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the eight Project Areas and, if any existed, to determine
if the projects had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for
formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources surveys were
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8397.
The cultural resources surveys of the eight Project Areas resulted in entirely negative
results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the assessed locations or within
any of the excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of
the eight projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as
or considered eligible for designation as SALs on GLO property.
Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. The THC concurred with these recommendations for all
eight projects.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of intensive cultural resources surveys conducted
during the 2018 calendar year for eight proposed Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko)
projects located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO) in Reeves County,
Texas (Project Areas) (Figure 1-1). All eight projects were privately funded and did not require
any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the GLO is considered to be a political
subdivision of the State, the portions of the eight projects on GLO property fell under the
regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc.
(Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources
survey of the Project Areas on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose
of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the eight Project
Areas and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse
impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs). The cultural resources surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee
(TAC) annual permit number 8397.
The eight Anadarko projects assessed by Horizon in 2018 included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) that were located wholly or in part on tracts of land
owned by the GLO. The well pads are typically constructed by leveling each area by bulldozing
the higher elevations and using that material to fill the lower elevations. Additional fill may be
brought in if necessary. The well pads often have associated reserve pits to contain liquids
associated with or produced by the well drilling. Reserve pit construction typically consists of
the excavation of pit several feet deep that is then lined with a polyethylene liner. Access road
construction consists of the bulldozing (cutting and filling) of the alignment and may also include
the capping of the alignment with caliche or other forms of road base. Pipeline construction
efforts consist of the clearing of each ROW of vegetation via heavy machinery followed by the
excavation of the pipeline trench measuring several feet wide and excavated down to depths
around 6.0 feet (1.8 meters [m]) below surface. Only the portions of each project situated on
GLO land were assessed under TAC annual permit number 8397. These included the entirety
of certain projects and only portions of others. Overall, these surveys assessed approximately
23.7 acres of GLO land. Each of the eight projects is listed in Table 1-1, along with its map
identifier in Figure 1-1. The individual interim reports prepared for each project, as well as the
individual responses from the Texas Historical Commission (THC), are presented in
Appendix A.

The cultural resources investigations for each of the eight projects consisted of an initial
archival review, an intensive cultural resources survey of each Project Area, the production of
interim reports submitted for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), and the
production of a final report for review by the SHPO in accordance with the THC’s Rules of
Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s
president) served as the project’s principal investigator, while Jacob Lyons, Briana Smith, Jared
Wiersema, and Foster Duncan conducted the field investigations at various times in 2018.
The cultural resources surveys of the eight Project Areas resulted in entirely negative
results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the assessed locations or within
any of the excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of
the eight projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as
or considered eligible for designation as SALs on GLO property.
Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) were inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, Horizon further recommended that all work at the location of the discovery
should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery. The THC
concurred with these recommendations for all eight projects.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The eight Anadarko projects on GLO land that were assessed in 2018 are all located in
northwestern and north-central Reeves County, Texas. Four of the eight projects are located in
the vicinity of Orla, Texas, and can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Orla, Threemile Draw, and Screw Bean Draw NE, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps. The
remaining 4 projects are located south of Mentone, Texas, on the USGS 7.5-minute Mentone
SW and Sand Lake, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps (see Figure 1-1; also see individual
interim reports in Appendix A). The eight projects include five pipeline/flowline ROWs and three
well pads with associated access road ROWs. Each of these eight projects is summarized in
Table 2-1.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The eight Project Areas are located within desert settings in West Texas. They are
typically found in relatively flat to gently undulating desert hills that are dissected by a variety of
drainages and draws, including Salt Creek, Threemile Draw, and tributaries of the Pecos River.
Representative images of the Project Areas are presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.
Hydrologically, all eight of the Project Areas are situated within the Pecos River basin.
All are located to the west or southwest of the Pecos River and are drained to the east or
northeast by the various water channels listed above.

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Reeves County are generally cool, with an average temperature of
46.0 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of
83.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 8.6 inches (21.8 centimeters [cm]), with
roughly 70% of it falling between April and September (NRCS 1980).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The eight Project Areas are located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes
all of Trans-Pecos Texas except for the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950). Blair notes that
portions of Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now
drained by the Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the
Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, the Project Areas are situated on geologic formations
comprising sand sheet and caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant
communities dominate the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa
margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland. The dominant species associated with the saline
flats and alkaline playa margins plant community include fourwing saltbush (Atriplex
canescens), seepweed (Suaeda spp.), pickleweed (Salicornia spp.), and alkali sacaton
(Sporobolus airoides). The dominant species associated with the gypsum land plant community
include gypsum grama (Bouteloua breviseta), blazingstar (Mentzelia spp.), and Torrey’s jointfir
(Ephedra torreyana). The dominant species associated with the desert shrubland plant
community include creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), American tarwort (Flourensia cernua),
yucca (Yucca spp.), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), Christmas
cactus (Cylindropuntia leptocaulis), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), and cenizo (Leucophyllum
frutescens) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 REGIONAL HISTORY

3.1

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.),
Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic period is
further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6000 B.P. to
3500 B.P.), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.) subperiods.
3.1.1

PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.
3.1.2

Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces

HJN 160006 AR 100

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.
Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.
3.1.3

Middle Archaic (6000 to 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.
3.1.4

Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.
3.1.5

Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.
3.1.6

Historic (250 B.P. to Present)

The history of Reeves County is not well documented, due to its remoteness and low
population. The Antonio de Espejo expedition was one of the first Spanish expeditions to cross
into West Texas. According to Smith (2017), this expedition encountered a group of 3 Jumano
Indians near Toyah Lake in eastern Reeves County in 1853. The Jumanos are said to have
irrigated crops of peaches and corn near Balmorhea (Smith 2017). Later visitors to the region
noted groups of Mescalero Indians growing corn along Toyah Creek. It wasn’t until the 1870s
that the first Anglo farmers and ranchers began to settle the area.
Named for Confederate colonel George R. Reeves, Reeves County separated from
Pecos County in 1883 and was organized 1884. Around the turn of the 20th century, state law
permitted sale of school lands in West Texas. This led to a rush of new settlers in the region.
By 1910, the population of the county had doubled to 4,392, with most residents living in the

Projects on General Land Office Property in Reeves County, Texas

numerous small towns that had sprung up, including Orla and Balmorhea, which were the only
2 towns with remaining post offices in the 1990s (Smith 2017). The 1920s and 1930s saw the
expansion of oil exploration in the region, and the population increased to 6,407 residents. By
the 1990s, the Reeves County economy was primarily based on oil and agriculture. In the early
2000s, the population had increased to 14,349.

3.2

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The northwestern region of Reeves County has undergone extensive archaeological
surveys in the last 60 years, with the majority having been completed since the mid-1980s.
Most of these archaeological projects included Phase I and II subsurface investigations in
support of oil and gas extraction projects. These investigations were undertaken along pipeline
corridors and well pads for companies such as Anadarko, El Paso Natural Gas Company, and
All American Pipeline. Archaeological surveys were completed by environmental engineering
firms such as Horizon, SWCA, Inc., and Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, as well
as from academic institutions such as the Cultural Resource Management Division from New
Mexico State University.
The archaeological sites recorded in Reeves County demonstrate a wide range of Native
American historic and prehistoric material culture, with noteworthy examples of skilled artistic
expression in both pictographs and petroglyphs, as well as in the form of richly decorated clay
vessels, and other ritual and ceremonial objects depicted in media such as exotic shell, bone, or
rare stone, such as turquoise, malachite, and kaolinite (O’Laughlin and Black 2019). The
temporal range of these cultures spans from Paleoindian, through the Archaic, and into the
Contact period. Many of the sites consist of prehistoric lithic scatters, burned rock middens
containing fire-cracked rock (FCR), hearth features with faunal remains, and ceramic sherd
assemblages. The distinct archaeological tradition Jornada Mogollon existed in the region from
roughly A.D. 400- 1500 (Lehmer 1948). These peoples practiced sedentary lifeways, including
an emphasis on cultigen intensification, such as maize and squash. The Jornada Mogollon, a
part of the Pueblo complex, lived in pithouse villages (Whalen 1981) and produced skilled
ceramic techniques such as El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-White, and Playas Red
incised (O’Laughlin 2001). All of these ceramic styles favor the Casas Grandes (Paquime)
culture artistic style to the south near Chihuahua, Mexico (Lehmer 1958). These shared artistic
types demonstrate extensive trade networks in and out of the Reeves County area. Later
historic tribes in the region included the Jumanos, Apache, and Comanches.
Reeves County contains several archaeological sites, which are exceptional and notable
to mention. Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric petroglyphs occur at 41LV1, also known as
Jackson’s Petroglyph Site, and at the Graef Petroglyph Site. The artistic style at Graef bears
similarities to the Chihuahuan Desert Abstract Style of the Late Archaic period, and includes
depictions of geometric designs, concentric circles, animals, and anthropomorphic figures. Site
41RV9 contains several Late Prehistoric burials in a large rock cairn, and site 41RV49 contains
seven Cornertang bifacial knives and several temporally diagnostic projectile point styles,
including Toyah, Frio, Langtry, Paisano, Ensor, Guadalupe, and Carlsbad.

4.0 METHODOLOGY

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Prior to all field survey efforts, a Horizon archeologist conducted archival research via
the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database and via the National Park
Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer to
ascertain the number, type, and significance of any previously recorded archeological sites,
cemeteries, and historic properties within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of each of the eight Project
Areas. Given the remoteness of the Project Areas and the general lack of prior surveys in the
area, most of the eight Project Areas had no documented cultural resources within the 1.0-mile
(1.6 km) review perimeters. The results of the archival research conducted for each of the
eight projects are presented within the associated interim reports in Appendix A.

4.2

FIELD METHODS

A 1- to 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed each of the eight separate
Project Areas at various times in 2018. The survey efforts typically entailed intensive surface
inspection and subsurface shovel testing within each Project Area. For projects between
3.0 and 10.0 acres in size, which included most of the well pads, the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre. For
linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, which included all of the assessed
pipeline and access road ROWs, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile.
Horizon met or exceeded the TSMASS on all of the eight Project Areas. The number of shovel
tests excavated within each Project Area are presented in Table 4-1. The specific methodology
for each of the eight projects is presented within the associated interim reports in Appendix A.
All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh
or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
For each project, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
shovel tests, and cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on any artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site
forms were completed and filed at the TARL for permanent housing. Similarly, for any
previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated site forms were completed
and filed at the TARL.

A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations and shovel test data are presented within the
associated interim reports in Appendix A.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and

Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of
the eight projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as
or considered eligible for designation as SALs on GLO property.
Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) were inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, Horizon further recommended that all work at the location of the discovery
should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery. The THC

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Zeman 3-16 Unit 1H Flowline Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 8397
HJN 160006 AR 78

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Zeman 3-16 Unit 1H
Flowline Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development of
the Project Area will be privately funded. However, a portion of the Project Area is located on
property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a
political subdivision of the state, this portion of undertaking falls under the regulations of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources
survey of the portion of the Project Area on GLO land in compliance with the ACT. The purpose
of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on
GLO land and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse
impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8397.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8397 during the 2018 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 8.0 miles (12.9 kilometers [km])
southeast of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Sand Lake, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a pipeline rightof-way (ROW) that measures approximately 3557.5 feet (1084.3 meters [m]) long by 30.0 feet
(9.1 m) wide (approximately 2.5 acres). However, only approximately 297.9 feet (90.8 m; 0.2
acre) of the Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of 1 previously
recorded archeological site and 1 cemetery within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2018), while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed
on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2018). These documented cultural resources
and their distances from the Project Area are summarized in Table 1, while their locations
relative to the Project Area are presented in Figure 5. No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above the floodplain of the Pecos River, in conjunction with the presence of
a previously recorded prehistoric site within the review perimeter, it was Horizon’s opinion prior
to the field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric
cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on GLO
land for cultural resources on 2 May 2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the
excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land
totals approximately 297.9 feet (90.8 m) in length, a minimum of 1 to 2 shovel tests were
necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a
total of 2 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through
0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils
prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on
Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 3.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the portion of the Project Area on GLO land resulted in entirely
negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area on
GLO land or within any of the 2 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Zeman
3-16 Unit 1H Flowline Project across GLO land will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project Area

(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately,
and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8397 during the 2018 calendar year.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Cathedral State 57-6
Gas Pipeline Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development
of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, portions of the Project Area are located
on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2018). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV106, is located approximately 2.0 miles (3.2 km) north of the Project Area.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area on GLO land. This soil is

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above Salt Creek and one of its tributaries, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to
the field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric
cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on GLO
land for cultural resources on 2 May 2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the
excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the portions of the Project Area on GLO land
total approximately 1941.2 feet (591.7 m) in length, a minimum of 6 shovel tests were necessary
along these portions of the proposed ROW. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a
total of 9 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through
0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils
prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on
Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the portions of the Project Area on GLO land resulted in
entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project
Area on GLO land or within any of the 9 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Cathedral State 57-6 Gas Pipeline Project across GLO land will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
China Draw CDP and HP Pipeline and Access Road Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 8397
HJN 160006 AR 80

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the China Draw CDP and
HP Pipeline and Access Road Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1
through 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, portions of
the Project Area are located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As
the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the portions of undertaking on
GLO land fall under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of
Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services,
Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the portions of the Project Area on GLO
land in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area on GLO land and, if any existed, to
determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the
cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit
number 8397.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8397 during the 2018 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 10.4 miles (16.7 kilometers [km])
northwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Screw Bean Draw NE, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a
pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that measures approximately 2456.0 feet (748.6 meters [m]) long

by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide (approximately 1.7 acres) and a proposed access road ROW that
measures approximately 996.4 feet (303.7 m) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide (approximately 0.7
acre). However, only approximately 749.1 feet (228.3 m) of proposed pipeline ROW and 574.6
feet (175.1 m) of proposed access road ROW are located on GLO land (approximately 0.9 acre
total).
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2018). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite. This
site, 41CU800, is located approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 km) northwest of the Project Area in
Culberson County.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area on GLO land. This soil is
summarized in Table 1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 5.

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Thunderdome 54-4-24
Unit 1H Well Pad Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 through 4). The
development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project Area is located

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2018). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV114, is located approximately 2.0 miles (3.2 km) northwest of the Project
Area.

proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform between drainages linked to the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to
the field efforts that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the

Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on 6 June
2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2
shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size. As the Project
Area totals approximately 5.7 acres, a minimum of 11 shovel tests were necessary within the
Project Area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 11 shovel tests within the
Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The
locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are
presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
11 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Thunderdome 54-4-24 Unit 1H Well Pad Project will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project
Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Saratoga State 54-4-10 Unit 2H, 3H, and 4H Well Pad Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 8397
HJN 160006 AR 83

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Saratoga State 54-410 Unit 2H, 3H, and 4H Well Pad Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1
through 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project
Area is located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is
considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is regulated by the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources
survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on GLO land and, if
any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon
conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
annual permit number 8397.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8397 during the 2018 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 7.7 miles (12.4 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Sand Lake, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a 5.4-acre well
pad and an access road right-of-way (ROW) that measures approximately 1009.0 feet (307.5
meters [m]) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide (approximately 0.7 acre). Overall, the Project Area
totals approximately 6.1 acres.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2018). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV114, is located approximately 1.3 miles (2.1 km) northwest of the Project
Area.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area. This soil is summarized in

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above several unnamed drainages, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field
efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on 6 June
2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2
shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size. As the well
pad portion of the Project Area totals approximately 5.4 acres, a minimum of 11 shovel tests
were necessary within this portion of the Project Area. In addition, the TSMASS require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the proposed access road portion of the Project Area measures approximately 1009.0
feet (307.5 m) in length, a minimum of 3 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the
Project Area. In all, a minimum of 14 shovel tests were necessary across the entire Project
Area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 15 shovel tests within the Project
Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware
mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of
the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table
2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
15 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Saratoga State 54-4-10 Unit 2H, 3H, and 4H Well Pad Project will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.

Area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 20 shovel tests within the Project
Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware
mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. Shovel test
locations are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
20 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Kaycee
State 57-3-33 Unit 2H-4H Well Pad Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project Area
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately,
and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.

Saratoga State 54-4-10 Unit 2H-4H Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 8397
HJN 160006 AR 88

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Saratoga State 54-410 Unit 2H-4H Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area;
Figures 1 through 5). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, a
segment of the Project Area is located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the portion of the
undertaking on GLO land is regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of
Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services,
Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the
ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within
the Project Area on GLO land and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to
have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8397.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8397 during the 2018 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 7.8 miles (12.5 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Sand Lake, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of separate oil,
gas, and salt water disposal pipelines all contained within one right-of-way (ROW) measuring
approximately 1470.8 feet (448.3 meters [m]) in length and 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide

(approximately 3.4 acres). However, only approximately 558.8 feet (170.3 m; 1.3 acres) of the
Project Area is located on GLO land.
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2018). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV114, is located approximately 3.3 miles (2.1 km) northwest of the Project
Area.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area. This soil is summarized in

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above an unnamed drainage linked to the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s
opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A Horizon archeologist assessed the portion of the Project Area on GLO land on 9 August 2018.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16
shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the
portion of the Project Area on GLO land measures approximately 558.8 feet (170.3 m) in length,
a minimum of 2 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the Project Area. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 5 shovel tests within the portion of the Project
Area on GLO land. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter
[mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Shovel test locations are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
5 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Saratoga State 54-4-10 Unit 2H-4H Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects will have no adverse
effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as
SALs on GLO land. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above an unnamed drainage linked to the Threemile Draw, it was Horizon’s
opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A Horizon archeologist assessed the portion of the Project Area on GLO land for cultural
resources on 27 December 2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation
of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards
(TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to
100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land measures
approximately 631.3 feet (192.4 m) in length, a minimum of 2 shovel tests were necessary along
these portions of the proposed ROW. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of
3 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch
(6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 7.
Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the portions of the Project Area on GLO land resulted in
entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project
Area on GLO land or within any of the 3 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Kaycee
State 57-3-33 Unit 2H-4H (Gas, Oil, SWD) Pipeline Projects across GLO land will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are

the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of
the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8397 during the 2018 calendar year.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.
Sincerely,
For Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
