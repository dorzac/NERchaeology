1.0 DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
This report details the results of a Phase I cultural resources survey conducted on an
area located in northwest Harris County, Texas (Figure 1). This survey was conducted
for Aviles Engineering Inc., which was subcontracted by Harris County Public
Infrastructure Department.

Harris County is planning improvements to Huffmeister

Road and Louetta Road from approximately 400 feet west of Meadowside Park Drive to
Little Cypress Creek in northwestern Harris County, Texas.
In the Area of Potential Effect (APE) construction of a typical Harris County four-lane
boulevard with associated storm sewer and drainage facilities within a 100-foot wide
right-of-way corridor will be constructed. In addition, the intersection at Huffmeister
Road and Louetta Road will be realigned to a typical T-intersection. A storm water
pipeline will be installed in the right-of-way corridor and discharged at an outfall into
Little Cypress Creek. Prior to discharging into Little Cypress Creek, the storm sewer
pipeline will intersect an approximately 6-acre storm water detention pond located
adjacent to the south of the right-of-way. Except for approximately the northeastern
1,250 feet (381 m), the right-of-way corridor will be predominantly located in developed
and cleared Huffmeister Road and Louetta Road right-of-way.

Approximately the

northeastern 1,250 feet (381 m) of the right-of-way corridor and the detention pond will
be located in an undeveloped forested area, currently on private land, that is planned to
be acquired.
The APE is located in southeast Texas, and is within the West Gulf Coastal Plain of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province and is part of the Northern Humid Gulf Coastal
Prairie. The vegetation of the Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Prairie consists of yellow
indiangrass, little bluestem, gulf muhly, and brownseed paspalum (Wheeler 1976). In
the forested areas of the county, pine, post oak, and black jack oak are present. The
soils found in the APE are comprised of Wockley. These soils are composed of a fine
sandy loam which occurs as a nearly level soil in irregular-shaped broad areas of prairie

and forest. The surface of Wockley fine sandy loam is plane to slightly concave and
slopes average 0.3 percent (Wheeler 1976).
The vegetation of the Study Area primarily consists of trees, small shrubs, and some
grasses.

Prehistorically, the area could have been used as a campsite.

This is

primarily due to its proximity to Little Cypress Creek. Potential animal resources would
have included bears, deer, squirrels, raccoons, opossum, rabbits, skunks, and gophers.
Aquatic resources would have included freshwater and saltwater shell fish, mussels and
snails, alligators, different species of fish, turtles, and snakes. Also, bison, deer, and
antelope would have been occasionally exploited by people in the area.

2.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Gulf Coast Archaeology Group (GCA Group) conducted a Phase I cultural resources
survey on the area that will be impacted by the proposed road improvement. This area
is located in northwestern Harris County, Texas. This survey was conducted to: a)
locate any possible cultural resources that may be located within the Area of Potential
Effect (APE); b) assess the significance of the cultural resources following the criteria
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP); and c) to make
recommendations for avoidance or mitigation procedures for any culturally significant
properties.

These activities are specified under legislation including the National

Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended in 1981, and the regulations (36 CFR
800) of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
Report write-up and project supervision was conducted under principal investigator
Anna N. Enderli, RPA. The Phase I cultural resources survey was conducted by Mr.
Jorge Garcia-Herreros,RPA Phillip Ahearn, and Fabian Garavito on June 12, 13, and
18, 2011.

3.0 RESEARCH DESIGN
The Study Area was surveyed according to Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas
and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The Phase I cultural resources survey
consisted of a systematic survey of the APE or Study Area using a pedestrian and/or
shovel test method.
An overview of the Study Area prior to the field survey was conducted in order to
characterize the probability of cultural resources being located within the APE.
Topographic maps and aerial photographs showed that the APE had moderate to high
probability of containing cultural resources. This assessment was primarily based on
the topography of the APE and its proximity to Little Cypress Creek (Figure 2). A
search in the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas found one archaeological site previously
recorded within a 1-mile radius of the Study Area and a cemetery. This cemetery is St.
Lutheran Cemetery.

Table 1. Cultural resources recorded within a 2 mile radius.

The cultural resources background research of the Study Area confirmed classifying the
area as moderate to high probability area. This is based on additional archaeological
sites located within the vicinity of Little Cypress Creek. These sites are located further
than 2-miles from the APE. The potential significant cultural resources that could have
been found in the Study Area consisted of historic sites, prehistoric camps, and other
historic cultural resources.

Therefore, due to the probability of cultural resources

present, it was determined that intensive survey of the APE was necessary.

4.0 RESULTS
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) surveyed by GCA Group is located in Harris County,
Texas. The area surveyed is located on the western side of Little Cypress Creek. The
Area of Potential Effect (APE) was surveyed June 12, 13, and 18, 2011. The APE
consisted of a linear corridor and an area where a retention pond will be located.
Surface inspection of the APE did not identify any prehistoric or historic features. No
significant historic structures were noted within the vicinity of the APE. Currently the
area adjacent to the APE is being developed into multiple subdivisions (Plate 1).

Harris County plan improvements will be approximately 3,805 feet (1160 m) long and
100 feet (30.5 m) wide of which 1,250 feet (381 m) is in an undeveloped area. The
remaining 2,555 feet (778.76 m) is located within existing developed right-of-way. The
portion of the right-of-way that is in existing developed right-of-way was not shovel
tested, but was pedestrian surveyed. In addition to shovel testing the undeveloped
right-of-way, a 6-acre area where a retention pond will be created was also shovel
tested. In total, the current archaeological survey examined a 14.73 square acre area.

Due to the dry soil conditions the soil ranged from compact to very compact. In some
cases an 8 inch gas power auger was used in order to excavate the shovel tests, since
they could not be excavated with a shovel. In the cases that the auger was used, the
soil brought up by the auger was visually inspected. The soils excavated with a shovel
were screened through a ¼ inch mesh screen. The ground visibility at the APE ranged
from 10 to 100 percent (Plates 2 and 3). The vegetation was primarily composed of
trees, small shrubs, and grasses (Plate 4).

A total of 22 shovel tests were excavated within the proposed APE (Figure 3). Shovel
tests were excavated only in areas that were not disturbed or developed. Ten shovel
tests were excavated within the proposed road easement and 12 shovel tests were

excavated within the area designated for the retention pond (Figure 3). The shovel
tests or auger probes excavated ranged in depth between 17 cm to 100 cm (6.7 in to
39.4 in). The soil stratigraphy found during the shovel test excavations was generally
composed of a light grey (10YR7/2) to a yellow (10YR7/6) fine sand to fine sandy loam.
Underneath this layer a grayish brown (10YR5/2) to a very pale brown (10YR8/4) clayey
sand was found (Plates 5 and 6).

The soils of the APE were classified as belonging to the Wockley association. These
soils are classified as fine sandy loam occurring as a nearly level soil in irregularshaped broad areas of prairie and forest. The surface of Wockley fine sandy loam is

are somewhat poorly drained, surface runoff is slow, and the available water capacity is
high (Wheeler 1976). Modern trash material was noted throughout the wooded area.
Overall, the pedestrian survey and trench excavations found no significant cultural
features and no significant artifacts.

5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
Although the area surveyed was located within an area of moderate to high probability,
the cultural resources investigation of the APE did not yield any significant cultural
resources. As mentioned in Section 4, approximately 2,555 feet (778.76 m) of the
planned improvements are within the existing developed easement. The area that was
shovel tested was within the undeveloped section.

Within the developed portion,

known disturbances included construction of Huffmeister and Louetta roads, the
placement of communication, power, and gas lines.

Over all, the Phase I cultural

resources survey did not find any cultural resources that would be adversely affected by
the proposed construction. At the same time, no historical structures or features will be
affected. Therefore, based upon the current findings, it is recommended that no further
archaeological work be conducted on the APE.
It is recommended that if the APE is moved or if its boundaries change that these areas
be surveyed for the presence of any cultural resources. Should any archaeological
deposits or features be exposed during construction, activities should cease within the
immediate area and the Texas Historical Commission should be contacted immediately.
