ABSTRACT
In November 2012 through June 2013, American Archaeology Group LLC
conducted an archaeological survey of 22,595 feet (totaling 25.93 acres) of the proposed
Leon River Wastewater Line 2012 project for the City of Temple. The project was funded
by the City of Temple and was conducted under the auspices of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) under a Nationwide 404 Permit and Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 6362 in order to comport with provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT)
in anticipation of review by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The investigation
consisted of a pedestrian survey supported with mechanical augering and trenching. The
middle and southern portions of the proposed project alignment contain a significant
number of utilities including water, wastewater, electric, natural gas transmission,
telephone and cable thus creating safety hazards and impacting soil deposits. Four
archaeological sites were recorded. Two prehistoric sites (41BL1390 and 41BL1391)
were recorded on the north side of the Leon River and consisted of freshwater mussel
shell deposits located on or near the surface of two natural levees. Radiocarbon samples
were recovered from both samples were submitted for radiometric assays and the dates
indicated that both sites date to the Transitional Archaic time period (41BL1390 was Cal
2330 to 2140 BP and 41BL1391 was Cal 2150 to 2000 BP). Site 41BL1392 was recorded
as an old historic habitation site with associated ranching features including a wood pole
barn and two smaller wood structures dating from the early Twentieth Century. No
subsurface cultural deposits were encountered as well as no surface deposits were
observed. The proposed line route will not alter or destroy any of the buildings which
appear to be outside of the project area but were recorded for local preservation purposes.
The fourth site encountered (41BL1393) was a historic metal culvert and concrete slab
bridge that allows access to gain entry to the property where site 41BL1392 was
recorded. All four sites are not considered worthy of inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Sites (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) recommends that construction within the
project area should be allowed to proceed as planned without archaeological monitoring.
No artifacts were recovered; therefore, no curation of artifacts was arranged and project
records are curated at AAG.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Temple plans to construct a 22,595 foot wastewater line (with a 20 foot right-ofway and additional 30 feet for construction easements totaling 25.93 acres) that runs from the north
end at Poison Oak Drive all the way south to the wastewater plant located off of State Highway 93
on the east side of the City of Belton, Bell County, Texas (Figure 1). The project is depicted on the
Belton 7.5' U.S.G.S topographic Zone 14 quadrangle map (Figures 1-4). The UTM coordinates for
the approximate center of the two tracts are Northing 3439340 and Easting 649036. The proposed
impacts will be approximately 4-6 feet below the surface. The elevation along the project route
varies from 512-542 feet above mean sea level. The project was funded by the City of Temple and
was conducted under the auspices of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) under a
Nationwide 404 Permit and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 6362 in order to comport with
provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) in anticipation of review by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Bell County is located within the Balconian biotic province includes the Gulf coastal plain
from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern Texas. The size and location of this province is described below
by Blair (1950:112):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in most of the Edwards Plateau as
limited by Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1933): (Figs. 3 and 4), the Lampasas Cut
Plain and Comanche Plateau of Raisz (1939 [cited as 1946 in Blair]), and the Central
Mineral or Llano Uplift region. That part of the Edwards Plateau lying west of the
Pecos, and often referred to as the Stockton Plateau, is not included, but is referred to
instead as the Chihuahuan province.
Climate
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east to west. Bell
County is located in the eastern half of the province which has been classified by Thornwaite (1948)
as dry subhumid, mesothermal with average annual potential evapotranspiration of between 39.27
and 44.88 inches. The annual rainfall for Bell County is 34 inches, the January minimum
temperature is 37 degrees Fahrenheit, the July maximum temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and
the growing season is 258 days (Kingston and Harris 1983).
Soils
There are nine soil series in the study area described in the Soil Survey of Bell County,
Texas (Huckabee, Jr. et al. 1977): Bosque clay loam, Frio silty clay frequently flooded, Krum
silty clay 0 to 1 percent slopes, Lewisville-Altoga Complex 2 to 5 percent slopes, Lewisville silty
clay 1 to 3 percent slopes, Patrick soils 1 to 8 percent slopes, Payne loam 1 to 3 percent slopes,
Pedernales fine sandy loam 1 to 3 percent slopes, and Venus clay loam 0 to 1 percent slopes.
Each soil series is divided into soil phases that may differ in texture, slope, stoniness, or some
other characteristic that affects the use of the soil by man. The phases are also diagnostic tools
used to determine the geomorphic and stratigraphic relationships of ancient landscapes.
Generally, the soils encountered along the study area are in situ soils that developed on the
residuum of the underlying Austin Chalk bedrock and clays deposited by the Leon River into the
adjacent floodplains. Austin Chalk is an upper Cretaceous interbedded chalk and marl that crops
out east of the Balcones Fault Zone in central Texas (Barnes 1970).
The nine soils found within the project area are described below:

5

Bosque clay loam (Be) is a soil that is primarily located on higher grounds along major
rivers. This soil series consists of: a surface layer of 0-5 inches grayish-brown (10YR 5/2) clay
loam; 5-16 inches grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam; 16-45 inches dark grayish brown (10YR
4/2) clay loam; 45-60 inches brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam; and 60-80 inches light brownish-gray
(10YR 6/2) silty clay (Huckabee et al. 1977:8-9).
Frio silty clay frequently flooded (Fs) is located on floodplains. This soil generally
consists of: a surface layer of dark grayish-brown silty clay down to approximately 36 inches;
the next layer is brown silty clay down to 80 inches (Huckabee et al. 1977:17).
Krum silty clay 0 to 1 percent slopes (KrA) is a nearly level soil on alluvial stream
terraces along alluvial stream terraces. This soil series consists of: 0-5 inches dark grayish-brown
(10YR 4/2) silty clay; 5-16 inches dark grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay: 16-36 inches very
dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay; 36-58 inches dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay; 66-82
inches very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay (Huckabee et al. 1977: 20-21).
Lewisville silty clay 1 to 3 percent slopes (LeB) is located along major streams. This soil
has a surface area of 0-4 inches of dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) silty clay; the next layer is 4-18
inches in depth consisting of dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) silty clay; the next layer is 18-34 inches
(7.5YR 4/4) silty clay (Huckabee et al. 1977:22).
Lewisville-Altoga Complex, 2 to 5 percent slopes (LgC) is primarily sloping and consists
of: a surface layer of very dark grayish-brown silty clay approximately 18 inches thick;
underlying is a dark brown silty clay to a depth of 24 inches; the next layer is a silty clay down to
30 inches; the next is a light yellowish-brown silty clay down to a depth of 60 inches (Huckabee
et al. 1977:22).
Patrick soils 1 to 8 percent slopes (PaD) is a gently sloping soil located primarily on ridge
tops. This soil consists of: 0-9 inches of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay; 9-18
inches dark yellowish-brown (10YR3/4) silty clay with limestone pebbles and calcareous; 18-70
inches clay with chert and limestone gravel (Huckabee et al. 1977:24).
Payne loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (PcB) is a deep, gently sloping, loamy soil. The soil
deposits generally consist of: 0-8 inches dark-brown loam; the next layer is generally dark
reddish-brown clay down to 48 inches; and the underlying soils are reddish-yellow silty clay
extended down to 75 inches (Huckabee et al. 1977:25).
Pedernales fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (PdB) is a gently sloping soil located
primarily on ridge tops and generally consists of: 0-5 inches brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam,
to dark brown (7.5YR 4/4); 5-14 inches brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay, dark red; 14-40 inches,
dark red (2.5YR 3/6) sandy clay, dark red; 40-52 inches red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay; 52-90
inches, gravel and sand mixture (Huckabee et al. 1977:25-26).

6

Venus clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (VeA) is a level soil on low terraces of flood
plains but on high landscope and do not flood. This soil series consists of: 0-6 inches (10YR 4/2)
dark grayish âbrown clay loam; 6-45 inches (10YR 4/2) dark brown clay loam; and 45-70
inches pale brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam (Huckabee et al. 1977:32-33).
Flora and Fauna
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this province is a
scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oak (Quercus texana), stunted live oak
(Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the Edwards
Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Vegetational species characteristic of the region include
Plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (Quercus texana), ash juniper (Juniperus ashei),
honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), cottonwood (Populus
deltoides), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), elm (Ulmus sp.), sumacs (Rhus sp.), Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), Texas stillingia (Stillingia texana), yucca (Yucca
spp.), Texas prickly pear (Opuntia Lindheimeri), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and American
beautyberry (Callicarpa americana). Grasslands include seep mulhy (Muhlenbergia reverchnoii),
Canadian wild rye (Elymus canadensis), dichanthelium (Dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama
(Bouteloua rigidiseta), and red grama (Bouteloua hirsuta). The project area is now primarily
overgrown with juniper and mixed oaks and grasses.
The project area is located well within the Balconian Biotic Province which is
characteristically represented by a general mixture of fauna from nearby surrounding provinces
(Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include White-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus), raccoon (Prycon lotor), hispid cotton
rat (Sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (Melagris gallopavo), morning dove (Zenaida macroura),
scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), western
coach whip (Masticophis flagellum testaceus), and the bull snake (Pituophis melanoleucus sayi).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Bell County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical region as defined by
Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas by most archaeologists and is rich
in archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Bell County and vicinity have been prepared by
various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at Fort Hood in Bell and Coryell counties,
Texas (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981, 1984; Thomas 1978; Roemer et al. 1985; Carlson
et al. 1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site (Shafer 1963), and Stillhouse
Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964; Sorrow et al. 1967). Summaries of the region have been
published by Suhm (1960), Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Most recently, two thorough
articles concerning Central Texas were published in Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society. These works, entitled "Forty Years of Archeology in Central Texas," by
Michael B. Collins (1995) and "Implications of Environmental Diversity in the Central Texas
Archeological Region" by Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995),
represent a major synthesis of the vast amount of collected data for the region. The following
discussion is taken primarily from the works cited above.
Paleoindian Period
According to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term âPaleoindian;â
nevertheless, the term is used ubiquitously in the archaeological literature, often to refer to
prehistoric cultures oriented toward big game procurement as a primary means of subsistence.
Collins (1995:381) posited instead that during Clovis times, Paleoindians exploited a diverse
range of fauna that not only included large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but
also included smaller animals such as turtles, land tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and
raccoons. The results of excavation of a cultural pavement at Kincaid Rockshelter suggest that
the Paleoindian inhabitants of the site returned there repeatedly as part of a regular hunting and
gathering strategy, in contrast with the migratory subsistence pattern of nomadic hunters who
only pursued big game. Thus, it is probable that the Clovis diet included a broad array of plants
(Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989).
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because so few sites have been
excavated. For example, as of 1985, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported for Bell
County (Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of Paleoindian cultures consists primarily of surfacecollected materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood, distinctive Paleoindian
projectile points were found in multi-component surface sites and as isolated finds (Carlson et al.
1986:125). Generally, it is believed that this period lasted from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000
B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart points of the Angostura, Clovis, Folsom,

8

Golondrina, and Plainview types as defined by Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester
(1985).
These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may be
more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931). Some
rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are located a
considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in Central Texas
immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian occupation is the Horn
Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County, Texas (Redder 1985). Collins (1999) reported on the Gault
Site, a major Clovis site in Bell County that is still being studied.
Archaic Period
The Archaic is a comparatively lengthy cultural period, which persisted in Central Texas
from approximately 8500-1250 years Before Present (B.P.). According to Prewitt (1981:71),
âThe Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas.â Prewitt (1981) has
subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. Johnson (1987) has questioned the validity of the
phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases occurring before the Middle Archaic.
Carlson et al. (1986:15) grouped these into Early, Middle, Late, and Terminal Periods.
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a âstrong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population was of
low density.â These characteristics apparently were predominant during the Circleville, San
Geronimo, and Jarrell phases (8500-5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering
apparently became very specialized as evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock
middens/mounds (Prewitt 1981:78-80). Prewitt divides the Middle Archaic into the Oakalla,
Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000-2600 B.P.). It appears that
considerably fewer burned rock middens were formed during the Late Archaic than in the earlier
Archaic. The archaeological record indicates that while bison were important in the diet of
prehistoric peoples, they were not necessarily the principal food source during this time (Prewitt
1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600-1750
B.P.). The terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson et al. (1986), includes the
Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750-1250 B.P.). An increase in the importance of gathering
and an apparent peak in site density seem to have occurred during Prewittâs (1981:82) Driftwood
phase. A majority of the sites in Williamson County are Archaic in age, which, according to
Prewitt (1981:Figure 3), lasted from 8500-1250 B.P. This interpretation is supported by Collinsâ
(1995:383) assertion that âtwo-thirds of the prehistory of Central Texas is âArchaicâ in
character.â

9

Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been characterized in the archaeological literature as the Neo-American
Stage (Suhm et al. 1954), the Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and the Post-Archaic (Johnson and
Goode 1994). The Late Prehistoric is typically divided into the Austin (1250-650 B.P.) and
Toyah (650-200 B.P.) phases. Technological changes are the primary distinguishing
characteristic of this stage. The archaeological record indicates that during this period, the bow
and arrow became the principal weapon for hunting and warfare, and that the use of ceramics
and the practice of horticulture first appeared in Central Texas and the surrounding regions.
According to Collins (1995:385), during the Late Prehistoric of Central Texas, the bow
and arrow were the first of these cultural innovations to be adopted, followed by pottery, and
finally agriculture though it was of relatively minor importance. Until the onset of these Late
Prehistoric adaptations, most cultural groups continued to practice hunting and gathering as their
principal means of subsistence, as had their ancestors throughout the Archaic and Paleoindian
periods. However, in about 800 B.P., evidence for a different subsistence adaptation appears in
the archaeological record and this cultural time boundary marks the separation between the late
Archaic and the Austin and Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric period (Collins 1995:385).
The most obvious of the changes that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period was the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, life ways in the Late Prehistoric were probably quite similar to those in the
earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A chronological model of bison presence
and absence periods on the southern plains suggests that bison were present during the Toyah
phase but not during the preceding Austin phase (Dillehay 1974).
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the Historic period of Central Texas into three sub-periods: early,
middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and European peoples and
cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous peoples had virtually disappeared. The
early Historic sub-period in Central Texas began in the late 17th century with the first documented
arrival of Europeans. Bell County is situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who
inhabited the area in the 16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th Century, they had broken ties
with the Comanche and Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32). They
have been described as typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and gatherers and who
lived along the streams and rivers of Central Texas.
During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous aboriginal groups including the
Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986). Trade is known to
have existed between the Jumanos and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and subsequently the

10

Comanches entered the region from the Plains while following key animal resources as they
migrated into Texas. Contact period occupations are often identified by the occurrence of glass
beads, gun parts, gun flints, metal projectile points, and European manufactured ceramics. The
archival search did not locate any Historic Indian sites in Bell County; Texas. In adjacent Coryell
County, a blue glass bead was found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial along the
Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an isolated find on Horse
Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).
Historically, Bell County was first settled in 1834 and 1835 by colonists who settled along
Little River. The area was abandoned during the "Runaway Scrape" of 1836, reoccupied, and
deserted again after the fall of Fort Parker in June 1836. The early settlements were constantly
harassed by hostile Indians and, although several forts were established, by 1838 all settlers had left
the county. On May 26, 1839, the Indians suffered a decisive defeat at what is referred to as the
"Famous Bird Creek Fight" about one and a half miles northwest of the present site of Temple,
Texas. However, settlement did not return to the Bell County area until after 1843.
Bell County was created on January 22, 1850 and was named for Peter H. Bell. Nolan
Springs was chosen as the county seat and named Nolanville, but on December 16, 1851 the name
was changed to Belton. Early settlement was along the creeks and rivers. William Pepper and his
family were living on the west side of present-day Kegley Road when the 1850 census was taken.
The Kegleys, Carpenters, and others settled near Pepper Creek during the 1850s, and some
members of these early families are buried at Eulogy Cemetery. Early histories of Bell County refer
frequently to the Shallowford Crossing on the Leon River as an important transportation route for
wagon traffic. The exact location of this crossing has not been identified, but it substantiates the
importance of this part of Bell County during its early settlement. By 1860, most of the land had
been taken. The last serious Indian raid occurred in 1859. With the Indian problem apparently
resolved, settlement increased and the county grew from 4799 in 1860, to 9771 in 1870, and to
20,518 in 1880. The number of farms in the county increased from 640 in 1869, to 2231 in 1871,
and to 4249 in 1889. Bell County is chiefly an agricultural region with cotton and corn the leading
crops. The construction of Fort Hood led to a population increase in the county from 44,863 in
1940 to 74,145 in 1950.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The efforts of members of the Central Texas Archaeological Society and Bell County
Archeological Society have made notable contributions. These include articles in the form of
bulletins, newsletters, special reports, and unpublished manuscripts on file at TARL or with society
members. Bell County has been the subject of intensive investigations by members of the Central
Texas Archeological Society. As a result of the above-mentioned investigations, "Bell County is
one of the better known Central Texas counties and has provided significant information toward the
understanding of prehistoric chronologies in this part of Texas" (Young 1987:9).
In the site files at TARL are numerous pieces of correspondence from landowners and
artifact collectors documenting and describing sites and artifacts found in Bell County. Also present
are copies of unpublished manuscripts, some of which do not provide information concerning
author and date of preparation. Information regarding previous work in other parts of Bell County
appear in the various references cited above, especially the Fort Hood series.
At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in the project area.
Surveys by Bradle and Moore (1998), Moore, Bradle and Nordt (1996a, 1996b); Moore and Bradle
(1996) recorded 8 prehistoric and historic sites on Pepper Creek, 2 sites (1 prehistoric and 1 historic)
on Fryers Creek, and 1 site containing prehistoric and historic materials on an unnamed tributary
that flows into Bird Creek. Three of these sites (41BL1066, 41BL1069, 41BL1070) have been
subjected to Phase II testing (Bradle et al. 1997). Bradle et al. (2003) surveyed 101.2 acres, of
which the northern half of the current project traverses across. One site (41BL1202) was recorded
as a mid-twentieth century farmstead that was not considered eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Archaeological Landmark
(SAL).
An archeological reconnaissance of a proposed wastewater collection and treatment
improvement in 1982 and 1984 by the Texas Department of Water Resources (Fox and Whitsett
1984) recorded eight prehistoric sites prehistoric sites (41BL259 - 41BL264 and 41BL278 41BL279). According to Fox and Whitsett (1984:6), "some site-specific investigations have been
done in Bell County (Watt 1936; Shafer 1963), but as yet detailed archeological investigations have
not been conducted in the Temple-Belton area." Except for testing at 41BL260 by Wayne C.
Young (1987) of the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, Highway
Design Division (now Texas Department of Transportation) in 1987, and the three tested sites
mentioned above, no additional site-specific investigations were identified during the literature
search for this project. In 1975, Texas Department of Transportation conducted two small surveys
through the project area, including right adjacent to the historic barn but neither included any
information on the barn nor did they record any sites.

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, AAG conducted a background investigation. Site records at the
Texas Historical Commission Sites Atlas in Austin, Texas were checked for previously recorded
sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, site reports documenting work in the region were
examined for information concerning archaeological surveys and other work relevant to the project
area. The project was discussed with representatives of Kasberg Patrick & Associates LLP to
ensure that the field crew was aware of the correct route for the proposed wastewater line.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished in from November 2012 through June 2013 using the
pedestrian survey method supported by auger testing backhoe trenching. Surface visibility was
approximately 30% therefore auger testing and backhoe trenching was utilized to maximize
subsurface inspection. In addition to intensive surface inspection, thirty-three (33) auger tests and
twenty-one (21) backhoe trenches were excavated in order to provide a more expansive view of
subsurface soil deposits and all were negative. The depth of the auger tests varied from 80
centimeters to 2.14 meters below the surface with an average depth of 1.77 meters. The depths of
the backhoe trenches varied from 79 centimeters (near surface bedrock exposure) to 2.11 meters
below the surface with an average depth of 1.67 meters. Additionally, nearby creek bank exposures
afforded ample opportunities to look for any observable subsurface deposits. No cultural materials
or deposits were observed along the creek bank. There also appeared to be some fill deposits present
too, possibly from previous railroad construction activities as well as land clearing that has
occurred.
The route changed especially at the Leon River crossing to go straight across to areas of
known disturbed deposit from previous quarry activities and road construction and avoid higher
probability areas (Figure 4). One backhoe trench was excavated on the south side of the Leon River
(BHT-9) in the only area where any intact deposits were located.
There were several areas in which subsurface testing could not be conducted but surface
examinations and shovel probing were conducted to at least examine the areas. Between AT9 and
AT23 (Figure 2) the landowner denied AAG access in order to conduct any subsurface testing;
however, during routine access of the area by road easement, no surface evidence of any cultural
materials was identified. This is a short segment that does not appear to be a high probability area.
As well, Figure 5 also shows some of the heavily plowed fields that have been impacted.
The area between AT8 and AT19 is an area where a number of utilities were located
including gas and water lines prevented any adequate access to test those areas (Figure 2).
Additionally, from AT3 to BHT-17 is an area (Figures 2 and 3) where significant construction for

13

road access, utilities, and pipelines lead into the Belton Wastewater Treatment Plant and thus were
too numerous and created risk management issues. From AT30 to southeast across Interstate 35
(Figure 3) are parking lots for large motorcycle and car dealerships that prevented any subsurface
testing, however these areas are considered low probability, and areas that were subjected to
previous intensive land clearing and construction activities.
Finally, from BHT-9 to old Highway 93 (Rockwool Road) is actually a very narrow area
adjacent to the fence line and road for an active quarry operation that has been operating for quite
some time in the area. This area has been bladed and subjected to numerous impacts and thus is also
in a low probability area. Shovel probing was used to at least test some of the soils since mechanical
equipment could not access such a small area (Figure 3). Along the north side of Old Highway 93 to
the northwest are a number of utilities which prevented the use of mechanical testing as well as
along Hubbard Lane which consisted of commercial businesses and fenced areas. BHT-8 was
excavated (Figure 6) at the edge of a cornfield and the road and AAG located additional unknown
utilities including a natural gas pipeline, thus shovel probing was utilized to complete this portion of
the project area.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The site records at TARL revealed no sites had been recorded in the project area. Largescale federal projects such as Belton Reservoir, Stillhouse Reservoir, and Fort Hood have recorded
the vast majority of sites in Bell County (see Archaeological Background and Previous
Investigations above). Recent projects by American Archaeology Group LLC personnel have
provided the majority of new data regarding prehistoric and historic utilization of the general project
area (see Previous Investigations above).
Field Survey
During the course of the survey, two historic sites (41BL1392 and 41BL1393) and two
prehistoric archaeological sites (41BL1390 and 41BL1391) were recorded. The two prehistoric
archaeological sites were discovered on two small natural levees above the Leon River in the
floodplains adjacent to the river (Appendix III). These consisted of freshwater mussel shell deposits.
Site 41BL1390 is located (Appendix III) almost immediately adjacent to the edge of the
Leon River and contained mussel shell fragments on the surface. Two backhoe trenches (BHT-10
and BHT-21) were excavated to test for any subsurface cultural deposits (Figures 8 and 9). Only
BHT-10 located any subsurface cultural deposits at 43 centimeters below the surface. However, it is
worth noting that the entire floodplain is under active cultivation and plowing and the plow or disc
appears to be disturbing the soil deposits down to a depth of 50 centimeters or possibly greater.
Since the majority of the mussel shell appears to be primarily at the surface, and only one mussel
shell fragment was located on a subsurface basis, it is assumed that the site is deflated, and the
integrity of the deposits compromised. However, AAG personnel collected the mussel shell at a
depth of 43 centimeters below the surface and submitted it to Beta Analytic (Beta Analytic Sample
Number 351611) for radiometric analysis in an attempt to at least gather some data on the
chronology of these very discrete occupations. The results of the radiocarbon assay are Cal 2330 to
2140 BP (Appendix IV-BHT-10), thus indicating the cultural deposits date to the Transitional
Archaic time period.

Site 41BL1391 is located in the middle of the floodplain (Appendix III; Figures 9 and 10)
on a very small natural levee approximately 50 meters northwest from site 41BL1390. This site also
contained mussel shell fragments on the surface. One backhoe trench (BHT-11) was excavated to
test for any subsurface cultural deposits. BHT-11 located subsurface cultural deposits at 24
centimeters below the surface. However, it is worth noting that the entire floodplain is under active
cultivation and plowing and the plow or disc appears to be disturbing the soil deposits down to a
depth of 50 centimeters or possibly greater. Since the majority of the mussel shell appears to be
primarily at the surface, and only one mussel shell fragment was located on a subsurface basis, it is
assumed that the site is deflated, and the integrity of the deposits compromised. However, AAG
personnel collected the mussel shell at a depth of 24 centimeters below the surface and submitted it
to Beta Analytic (Beta Analytic Sample Number 351612) for radiometric analysis in an attempt to
at least gather some data on the chronology of these very discrete occupations. The results of the
radiocarbon assays yielded a date of Cal 2150 to 2000 BP (Appendix IV-BHT-11), thus indicating
the cultural deposits date to the Transitional Archaic time period.

Site 41BL1392 was recorded as a historic farmstead (Appendix III) with the remnants of a
house and three barns still standing. Overall site size was approximately 295 x 648 feet (northeastsouthwest axis) and consisted of a pole barn (structure 1-Figure 11) which measured 40 x 45 feet in
size, two smaller wood barns (structures 2 [5 x 13 feet] and 3 [18 x 15 feet], Figure 12) and an old
ranch house (structure 4-Figure 13). These structures are all outside the right-of-way but AAG
recorded them to at least record the presence and some minimum information on another early
twentieth century farmstead operation in Bell County, Texas (Appendix III). The current owner
indicated that he had no historical information on any of the previous owners nor was he aware of
any historical aspects of the old farm site. None of the backhoe trenches within the vicinity of the
barn or in the proximity of the previous farm buildings contained any artifacts, features or
stratigraphy with any historic deposits. The portion of the site examined in the right-of-way that
contained no structures appears to be not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). If future impacts
to the structures will occur through another project, these buildings should be assessed.

21

Site 41BL1393 was recorded as a simple metal culvert and concrete slab bridge (Figure 14)
across the unnamed intermittent tributary to the Leon River near the confluence. It measured
5.7x7.9 meters and approximately 30 centimeters thick. No roads are located on the 1924 or 1965
(photo-revised 1993) USGS topographic maps for the Belton Quad sheet. It appears that this site
was nothing more than one access point to the property behind the Belton Wastewater Plant
(Appendix III). This site appears to be early to mid-twentieth century in age.
It is concluded that prehistoric groups did not consider the project area suitable for
habitation. Overall, the area has been farmed and does have some utilities running through the
property, including a lift station that is present in the southern portion of the property. Should any
sites be present, the possibility for significant research potential is considered low. As noted by
Bradle et al. (2003), the soils located in the local area are residual soils formed on underlying
bedrock or flood deposits from the Leon River.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The survey of the proposed Leon River Wastewater Line 2012 Project in Bell County,
Texas performed for the City of Temple identified and recorded four archaeological sites. Two
prehistoric sites (41BL1390 and 41BL1391) were recorded on the north side of the Leon River
and consisted of freshwater mussel shell deposits located on or near the surface of two natural
levees. Radiocarbon samples were recovered from both samples were submitted for radiometric
assays and the dates indicated that both sites date to the Transitional Archaic time period. Both
sites have been impacted by cultivation and the low density of shell indicates that these are small
discrete mussel sell cooking areas that have been impacted severely and displaced. Neither site is
deemed eligible for inclusion on the NRHP nor worthy of designation as a SAL. Site 41BL1392
was recorded as a historic farmstead site with associated ranching features including a wood pole
barn and two smaller wood structures dating from the early Twentieth Century. No subsurface
cultural deposits were encountered as well as no surface deposits were observed. The proposed
line route will not alter or destroy any of the buildings which appear to be outside of the project
area but were recorded for local preservation purposes. The portion of the site examined in the
right-of-way is not considered eligible for inclusion on the NRHP nor worthy of designation as a
SAL. The fourth site (41BL1393) encountered was a historic metal culvert and concrete slab
bridge that allows access to gain entry to the property where site 41BL1392 was recorded. Site
41BL1393 is not considered eligible for inclusion on the NRHP nor worthy of designation as a
SAL. American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction within the project area
should be allowed to proceed as planned without archaeological monitoring. No artifacts were
recovered; therefore, no curation was arranged. It is always possible that buried cultural materials
can be missed during any Phase I survey. Therefore, should any sites be found during the
construction of this wastewater line, all work within the site area should cease until the situation can
be evaluated by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission, in consultation with
American Archaeology Group LLC, Kasberg Patrick & Associates LP, and the City of Temple.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SCOPE OF WORK
Records Check
As mentioned, during this initial phase of the investigation, the AAG staff contacted the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), in Austin, Texas, to determine if any
archaeological sites had been previously recorded within the current project area. The contents of
the AAG library were also examined as part of the project background search and much of the
preliminary archival work was accomplished in-house. Since AAG had conducted considerable
archaeological work in the vicinity of the project area on previous occasions, the AAG staff was
already familiar with the much of the general project background data.
Permit Application
Before beginning any fieldwork, AAG collaborated with the THC Archeology Division
review staff concerning the level of effort that would be required for the investigation and the results
were made available to the client before the survey commenced. Fieldwork began after issuance of
permit 3762.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed using the pedestrian survey
method supported by augering and/or backhoe trenching and examination of eroded and disturbed
areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Backhoe trenching may be used to
examine deep soils to determine if cultural deposits are deeply buried. Herbert G. Uecker will act as
the Principal Investigator. Auger testing and backhoe trenching will meet and exceed the Minimum
Survey Standards for Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility and environmental settings that have potential for buried cultural
materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of high site
probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill will be screened through Â¼-inch
hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually excavated to sterile clay or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, cameras, compasses,
and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches, and archaeological
sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites, select areas in alluvial
settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected to backhoe trenching. All sites
identified in the project area will be mapped in the field and plotted on a topographic map. Site
locations will also be determined through the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site
will be recorded using the official State of Texas Archaeological Site Form. In no case will the
survey crew work outside of the project area as depicted on the project area map provided by the
client.

30

Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered through
shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on a field sack log.
They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless a petition to discard is
prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to AD-THC
and the client. AAG will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms, and any other
records produced from the project deemed to be a work product.
