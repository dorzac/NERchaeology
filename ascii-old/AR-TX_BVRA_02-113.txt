ABSTRACT
A Phase I archaeological survey of a proposed water supply line route in
northern Navarro and southern Ellis Counties, Texas was conducted by Brazos Valley
Research Associates in January and March 2003 for the Rice Water Supply Corporation
in Rice, Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 3037. The Federal agency overseeing
this project is the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development. One
archaeological site was found to be within the project area, the footprint of an Interurban
electric railway constructed in 1914 to transport passengers from Dallas to Corsicana.
Within the project area this site has been greatly disturbed as the track and bridges are
no longer present. A prehistoric site with a historic component (41NV677) was found
near the project area in an upland setting overlooking the old channel of Chambers
Creek. Since no significant sites were found in the project area, no additional
archaeological investigations are necessary. Copies of this report are on file at the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division; Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin; and Brazos Valley Research Associates.

INTRODUCTION
The Rice Water Supply Corporation proposes to construct a 16 inch water supply
line from a 24 inch water transmission line located in northern Corsicana to Booster
Plant Number 1 located within the City of Rice in northern Navarro County (Figure 1)
and a 10 inch water supply line from the existing 10 inch water supply line between
Alma at the location of Booster Plant Number 2 to the Teleco Plant on State Highway 34
in southern Ellis County (Figure 1).
The 16 inch line, between Corsicana and Rice, traverses 1396 feet along city
streets in the City of Rice before entering a cleared county road right-of-way of 13,968
feet and ending in a cleared power line right-of-way of 9840 feet. The proposed water
line is depicted on the 7.5' USGS topographic map Chatfield dated 1961 (figures 2-3).
The number of this map is 3296-123. This line, as currently planned, crosses three
major streams: Cummins Creek, Waxahachie Slough, and the old channel of Chambers
Creek, referred to on the topographic map as Old Channel. In all, the project area
covers approximately 8.7 acres.
Most of the water line route as currently planned follows the footprint of a now
defunct Interurban electric railroad constructed in 1914. In the floodplains of the major
creeks the footprint is evidenced today by elevated berms designed to keep the railroad
above the frequently flooded soils of the floodplains as well as concrete abutments at
creek crossings that once supported iron bridges. These berms are depicted on the
topographic maps as linear areas parallel and to the west of the Southern Pacific
Railroad. At major creek crossings where concrete abutments are present, the water
line will deviate from the footprint of the electric railroad and cross the streams in
apparently undisturbed floodplain settings.
The 10 inch line, between Alma and the Teleco Plant on State Highway 34 will
follow county road rights-of-way and cross-country routes along property lines in
southern Ellis County. It is depicted on the Ennis East topographic map (Figure 4). The
date of this map is 1962, and it was photorevised in 1978. The map number is 3296241. No trees will have to be removed since the entire line will be in a cleared area.
Navarro and Ellis counties are located in a region of Texas known to contain
significant prehistoric and historic sites. Realizing the archaeological potential of the
two proposed water lines, the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division,
required that a survey by a qualified archaeologist be conducted prior to construction of
the two water lines. This study was warranted according to Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The Federal agency
involved in this project is the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural
Development. In order to satisfy this requirement, The Rice Water Supply Corporation,
through J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc., retained Brazos Valley Research Associates
of Bryan, Texas to perform this service.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to entering the field, a check of the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory was conducted for Brazos Valley Research Associates by Allegra
Azulay. No sites were identified within the boundaries of the current project area. A
review of relevant archaeological reports was performed by the Principal Investigator in
order to become familiar with the kinds of sites present in the general area.
Archaeological Steward, Bill Young, was contacted and asked specific questions
regarding the potential for significant sites in the project area. A copy of a letter from
Mr. Young to Hollie H. Nowlin regarding prehistoric and historic sites in the project area
and vicinity was provided to Brazos Valley Research Associates by Hollie H. Nowlin of
J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. (Appendix I).
A literature review revealed that Ellis and Navarro Counties are located in the
North Central Texas region as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76) in Prehistoric
Archeological Sites in Texas: A Statistical Overview published by the Office of the State
Archeologist, Texas Historical Commission. This is an area that was well documented
in terms of numbers of sites in 1985 when compared to other regions of Texas. When
the statistical overview was compiled, a total of 2678 prehistoric sites (13.25% of the
state) was recorded in the entire region, mainly due to work on Richland and Chambers
creeks. Only the Central Texas region reported more sites or had a higher percentage
statewide, and only four counties in region, Bell (197), Coleman (151), Dallas (204), and
Hill (242) had more recorded sites (Biesaart et al. 1985:83).
A planning document that includes the current project area is presented in
Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993) published by the Texas Historical Commission. The interested
reader is referred to the overview by Biesaart and the planning document by Kenmotsu
and Perttula for additional information concerning Navarro County and its relation to the
rest of Texas.
Based on information provided by the above informants, archaeological contract
reports, and a review of the project area maps, several high probability areas were
identified. In the Navarro County section, three creek crossings were considered worthy
of subsurface investigation. These are Briar Creek, the old Channel of Chambers
Creek, and the floodplain of Waxahachie Slough. On the topographic map, Cummins
Creek is depicted as crossing the project area. However, this crossing is a modern
channel for flood control constructed in the 1920s. The old channel of Cummings Creek
does not cross the project area; instead, it flows into Waxahachie Slough. On the
topographic map, Chambers Creek also appears to be a major drainage. According to
Mr. Fortson, this channel was also created in the 1920s as a flood control measure; it
was eliminated as a high probability area and not investigated.

6

The segment of the line from the Rice city limits to the old channel of
Waxahachie Slough does not cross any major streams and is disturbed through road
construction and the presence of utilities. It was not considered likely to contain
significant archaeological sites; an opinion shared by Steward Bill Young, and was not
investigated.
The water line will be placed in the footprint of the Interurban electric railroad
constructed in 1914 virtually the entire distance of the water line. Where it crosses
floodplains it is an elevated berm constructed by borrowing dirt from an adjacent area.
These berms were not investigated because they were created from the borrowed dirt.
At creek crossings, however, the existing abutments from former bridges presented an
obstacle to the proposed water line. Therefore, it has to be rerouted in order to cross
the creek. It is in these locations that backhoe trenches were excavated.
In the Ellis County section there are two major creek crossings, Walker Creek
and Cottonwood Creek. At the time of the original survey in January, the client had not
been able to obtain landowner permission for the Cottonwood Creek crossing. Since
the Walker Creek crossing and associated water line rights-of-way had been examined
by Dr. S. Alan Skinner in 2000 (Skinner and Trask 2000), and Steward Bill Young
regarded this area (except for Walker Creek) as an area unlikely to contain significant
archaeological sites. In a letter signed by William A. Martin for F. Lawrence Oaks, State
Historic Preservation Officer, dated March 3, 2003, the Texas Historical Commission
recommended that future investigations in this area be limited to the Cottonwood Creek
crossing.
The closest investigation to the current project area is the survey by Skinner and
Trask (2000) who examined a five mile long water line and a water treatment plant near
Alma, Texas in the summer of 2000. No prehistoric sites were found in the area that is
referred to by the authors as a low probability area for significant sites. In their report
they defer to Archeological Steward Bill Young who has surveyed hundreds of acres in
the area. According to Skinner and Trask (2000:9), "Young believes that this area has
low potential for containing prehistoric archaeological sites, except that sites might be
found in the vicinity of Walker Creek." This survey did record three early 1900s historic
house sites (41EL242, 41EL243 and 41EL244) in and near the right-of-way.

FIELD METHODS

Edward P. Baxter examined the Cottonwood Creek crossing in Ellis County on
March 11, 2003. He walked the entire line on both sides of the creek, examined
exposed and disturbed areas, and conducted shovel testing on the various landforms.
All earth excavated during shovel testing was screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth.
Tests were 30 cm in diameter and dug to clay. A shovel test log was kept in the field
(Appendix II), and the tests were plotted on the topographic map Ennis East (Appendix
III). In all, 18 tests were excavated. Landowner Frank Laza informed investigator
Edward P. Baxter, that much of this area had been used for cotton production in the
past, an activity that depletes the topsoil. The presence of clay at or near the surface
over much of the Cottonwood Creek crossing is an indication that most of the topsoil is
now gone. Mr. Laza also mentioned that prehistoric artifacts have been found on
Cottonwood Creek at another location where sandy soils are present.
James E. Warren and two assistants examined the three creek crossings in
Navarro County on January 19-21, 2003. The crew visited all three major creek
crossings and conducted backhoe trenching (Figure 5). No shovel tests were
excavated since the majority of the water line will be placed in the elevated berms
associated with the 1914 Interurban electric railroad. The four backhoe trenches were
excavated to depths necessary to investigate the area proposed for construction (Area
of Potential Effect). It is believed that the number of backhoe trenches adequately
tested the creeks considered to have the potential for buried sites. Detailed maps
showing the relationship of the backhoe trenches to the Area of Potential Effect are
presented in Appendix IV. Appendix V contains profiles of the backhoe trenches.
The path of the 1914 Interurban electric railroad was not recorded as a historic
site since no physical evidence other than an occasional elevated earthen berm was
present. The track and bridges had been removed prior to this survey.
According to Archeological Steward Bill Young, a major prehistoric site was
reported by a local collector on the west side of the old road bed in the footprint of the
1914 Interurban electric railroad. Backhoe Trench 2 was placed in this area in an
attempt to find evidence of this site in the floodplain. The field survey crew also
examined the surface on the slope of the hill just above the floodplain for evidence of a
prehistoric site. Flakes and mussel shell were found on the surface of the east slope of
the hill outside the right-of-way, and a prehistoric site with a historic component was
brought to our attention by the landowner, Jackson Armstrong (Figure 4). Although
outside the project area right-of-way, it was recorded at TARL as 41NV677.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The archival research consisted of a records check at TARL and a review of
relevant archaeological reports. This task revealed that Ellis and Navarro Counties are
located in a part of Texas that is well documented in terms of numbers of sites
recorded, and several major reservoir studies have been conducted in the area,
particularly Richland-Chambers to the south. The Richland-Chambers reservoir project
has provided much of the data for the prehistory and history of Ellis and Navarro
Counties.
No prehistoric sites were found within the project area right-of-way. On an
upland landform south of the old channel of Chambers Creek is a prehistoric site
(41NV677) that is on private property outside the project area right-of-way (Figure 4).
This site was brought to the attention of the field crew by the landowner, Jackson
Armstrong. According to the topographic map, this landform extends to the east and
includes part of the right-of-way. If elements of site 41NV677 were once present in this
area, they were destroyed during construction of the 1914 Interurban electric railroad
berm. The prehistoric Site 41NV677 contains a historic component. According to the
landowner, a tenant shack inhabited by a Negro man was present on his property in the
early twentieth century.
One historic site was found to be located in the project area right-of-way. This is
the 1914 electric railroad constructed by the Southern Traction Company to transport
commuters from Dallas to Corsicana. This site is evidenced today by earthen berms
that used to support the track and concrete bridge abutments at creek crossings. The
bridges associated with the 1914 Interurban electric railroad have been destroyed, and
the track has been removed.
A review of The Handbook of Texas (Webb 1952) revealed that the right-of-way
is in an area that was an important transportation route during the late 19th century and
early 20th century. In 1871, the Houston & Texas Central Railway from Dallas to
Corsicana was completed. This line exists today under the name Southern Pacific
Railroad. Shortly after the arrival of the railroad, a county road was constructed parallel
to and west of the railroad. This road is evidenced today by two iron bridges that cross
the old channel of Chambers Creek and Cummins Creek. There is no surface on the
road, and the bridges are in poor condition. In 1914, the Interurban line was
constructed by the Southern Traction Company to transport commuters from Dallas to
Corsicana (Webb 1952:890). It ran parallel to and west of the county road. Today, the
route is evidenced by earthen berms in floodplains parallel to the county road. In 1917,
the line was taken over by the Texas Electric Railway Company, the current owner, who
has a power line in the old right-of-way (Webb 1952:890). Concrete abutments for iron
bridges at creek crossings remain as reminders of this now defunct transportation route.
The footprint of the old Interurban line is the path for the proposed water line.

10

No evidence of prehistoric activity was found to exist in the floodplain settings of
the three major creeks crossed by the project area right-of-way. Although, buried
floodplain sites may be present in other areas along these streams, the water crossings
in the path of the water line were not selected by aboriginal groups as campsites or food
extraction localities. Skinner and Trask (2000:7) discuss the potential for floodplain
sites in their survey in Ellis County to the north in the following:
It was anticipated that no prehistoric sites would be found buried in the
floodplain sediments. In part this research problem also focuses upon
drainage ranking (Stahler 1964; Weide and Weide 1973) with the
understanding that lower ranked drainages that lack perennial springs are
unlikely to be associated with regularly visited campsites.
The uplands south of Chambers Creek was an area that was selected by
prehistoric groups for a campsite or temporary utilization area. To the north in Ellis
County, Skinner and Trask believe that prehistoric campsites are most likely to be found
on relatively level ridge tops that overlook and project into floodplains. The areas
preferred are on landforms that are high enough to be safe from flooding. The project
area does not cross any "relatively level ridge tops" described by Skinner and Trask
above as likely settings for prehistoric sites. The closest setting is the ridge south of
Chambers Creek, and prehistoric site 41NV677 was found to be located on the top of
this landform.
The 1914 Interurban electric railroad is the only evidence of historic activity
directly within the project area right-of-way. This transportation route is only one of
many such arteries in this part of Texas. Although it represents a very important part of
the history of north-central Texas, the present condition of this site is poor. Therefore,
this site is not considered eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or listing
as a State Archeological Landmark.

11

RECOMMENDATIONS
No significant archaeological sites were found to exist within the current project
area. It is, therefore, recommended that the Rice Water Supply Corporation be allowed
to proceed with construction as planned. Should cultural materials become exposed
during construction in areas not mentioned in this report all work must cease until the
situation can be evaluated by a professional archaeologist in consultation with the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division and the United States Department of
Agriculture, Rural Development.

Re: Rice Water Supply and Sewer Corporation
Proposed Water System Improvements
Dear Ms. Nowlin:
I have looked over the proposed route of the water line for the City of Rice. Prior
to my commenting about any archeological or historical properties within the
proposed right-of-way, I decided to take a ride to the area just to make sure I
knew exactly where the line was going.
Needless to say, I was quite surprised to find the entire floodplain section
completely bulldozed removing all of the timber. When I tried to contact you,
they stated that you were out of the office on that particular day. However,
another person in your office felt sure that no one with the water system had
anything to do with the bulldozing. According to Larry McVay, the
Superintendent with the Rice system, he bulldozed the right-of-way. In this
particular case, I feel sure there wasn't any destruction or damage caused by the
ground clearing. In fact, the clearing will aid anyone doing a survey.
There are a few sites that need to be mentioned. First, in your letter it states that
the pipeline will be laid in the old abandoned road right-of-way. There are
several items associated with this. (1) There are two old iron bridges still
standing in this old roadbed. According to Mr. McVay, the landowner is going to
move them at some time in the future. This means that the pipe will go around
the two structures and not be laid in the old roadbed. (2) The railroad next to the
old roadbed was built in 1871 and known as the Houston & Texas Central
Railroad (H&TC). The old abandoned road was built at the same time as an
access road for the railroad construction and eventually was used as a road to
get to cities such as Rice, Ennis, and Dallas.
(3) Where the proposed line comes in contact with a large hill near the old
channel of Chambers Creek, I was told many years ago by a local collector that
when they built the Interurban Line on the west side of this old road bed, a major
prehistoric site was encountered in the floodplain next to the old creek channel.
This would conform to several other sites noted in the Richland/Chambers Lake

project and also matches another identical site located on the base of the next
hill to the east of this location. Several years ago, one could find a few flakes
and chips in the county road that goes around the hill but since the road has
been rocked, nothing can be found. I feel sure that the site located on the hill
was more or less destroyed when the county road, the Interurban, and the H&TC
Railroad was built. I cannot say if there is a site in the floodplain, only that I was
told about one. The person who told me passed away several years ago.
(4) Your current right-of-way shows that at this hill the line will make a bend and
then be placed in the right-of-way of the Old Interurban Railroad that is owned
today by TXU Electric who has a power line in the old right-of-way. At the next
creek to the south (Briar Creek), there is a new survey stake placed at the end of
an old concrete abutment that is part of the old bridge for the Interurban spanning
Briar Creek. In my opinion, there isn't any reason that the line should be moved
because of the old bridge abutments (both sides); however, I think they should
be properly recorded prior to construction.
From Rice southward to the floodplain, I am not aware of anything that would be
considered important. There used to be several historical houses located on the
west side of the county road that is still in use today. Referring to your map
number two at the Bench Mark Elevation of 352, the old abandoned road that
continues south from this point is all in a floodplain, and there aren't any sites that
I am aware of across the entire floodplain except for the old road, the two old iron
bridges, and the possible prehistoric site at the base of the hill.
Yours
