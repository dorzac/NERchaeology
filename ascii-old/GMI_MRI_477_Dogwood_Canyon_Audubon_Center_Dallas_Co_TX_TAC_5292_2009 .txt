ABSTRACT

On behalf of the Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center and the city of Cedar Hill, Geo-Marine, Inc.,
conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the high potential areas within a 270-acre parcel in
Cedar Hill, Dallas County, Texas, for a proposed Audubon Center. The center will be composed
of a visitors’ center, parking area, children’s garden, and approximately 6 miles of trails.
Judgmental shovel tests were limited to level areas adjacent to an intermittent stream and tops of
terraces flanking the steam. No artifactual materials were observed in the shovel tests, on the
ground surface, or in the stream cutbanks in the locations of the children’s garden and proposed
trail system, and the locations of the proposed visitors’ center and parking area have been heavily
disturbed by previous construction. The potential for historic properties within the project area is
low, and no further archeological work is recommended.
No artifacts were collected, but all records and photographs from this investigation will be
permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

The Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center, in conjunction with the city of Cedar Hill, is proposing a
new Audubon Center in Cedar Hill, Dallas County, Texas (Figure 1). Because the city is an
entity of the state of Texas and a grant from the Texas Parks and Wildlife grant is being pursued,
a cultural resources investigation was required under the Antiquities Code of Texas. Geo-Marine,
Inc. (GMI), was contracted to perform an archeological survey (GMI project number
30629.00.01) of the high probability areas of the proposed Audubon Center under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 5292. GMI archeologists Angela Tiné and Bethany Oliver conducted the
field investigation on July 22 and 28, 2009. Melissa Green, also of GMI, served as the project
Principal Investigator.
The project area consists of a 270-acre parcel in Dogwood Canyon in Cedar Hill in southwest
Dallas County. The property is on the south side of FM 1382 (Belt Line Road), approximately
1.4 miles east of Joe Pool Lake. The proposed Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center will consist of
a visitors’ center, paved driveway/parking area, children’s garden, and approximately 6 miles (4.6
acres) of proposed trails. Construction specifications for the visitors’ center and parking area
were not available at the time of the survey; however, the construction right-of-way for the
proposed nature trails will be no more than 6 feet in width and no more than 10 to 15 inches in
depth. To date, the course of only one trail has been specified. The remaining trails are to be
constructed in further into the future, and their locations are conceptual at present.
The proposed Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center is in a forest of mixed cedar and hardwood
trees (Figure 2). Understory consists of briers, poison ivy, and other vines and becomes denser
toward the southern portion of the project area. Leaf and needle cover blankets much of the
ground surface. A creek drainage extends roughly northeast-to-southwest through the project
area and divides it into two upland ridges, both of which slope toward the drainage, and terrain
ranges from nearly level to steeply sloping.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND GEOLOGICAL SETTINGS

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
Dallas County is part of the Texan biotic province, defined by Blair (1950) as an intermediate
zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces, and the grasslands of the
Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in
the Texan province. Almost all of Dallas County falls within the Blackland Prairie, one of
several tall grass prairies present in this northcentral part of Texas. Blackland Prairie vegetation
is dominated by uplands grasses. Woodlands are restricted to stream courses and river bottoms.
Prior to the disturbances associated with the Historic period, the wooded areas would have been
covered by a water-oak/elm/hackberry forest, with occasional grassy clearings and shallow water
marshes and ponds (McMahan et al. 1984). Today, this bottomland forest can include cedar elm,
American elm, willow oak, southern red oak, white oak, black willow, cottonwood, red ash,
sycamore, pecan, bois d’arc, flowering dogwood, dewberry, and coralberry. Among the grasses
expected to occur within the prairie setting are little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass,
dallisgrass, hairgrama switchgrass, rescuegrass, bermudagrass, sideoats grama, Texas
needlegrass, Torrey silver bluestem, eastern gramagrass, Virginia wildrye, Johnsongrass, giant
ragweed, and yankeeweed (Coffee et al. 1980:50, 92). Most of this vegetation was probably
present prehistorically.
The faunal community in the region has undergone massive changes due to the expansion of the
Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Among the wildlife that would have previously inhabited the
region would have been openland species (bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark, field sparrow,
cottontail, and red fox), woodland species (wild turkey, ruffled grouse, woodcock, thrushes,
woodpeckers, squirrel, gray fox, raccoon, and deer), wetland inhabitants (ducks, geese, heron,
shore birds, muskrat, mink, and beaver), and rangeland species (antelope, deer, sage grouse,
meadowlark, and lark bunting), along with various species of reptiles (Coffee et al. 1980:50;
Schmidly 1983).
The project area is located in the upper Trinity River basin, approximately 13 miles southwest of
the confluence of the West and Elm forks of the Trinity River. Mountain Creek rises in
eastcentral Johnson County and merges with the West Fork in Grand Prairie, Dallas County, 38
miles to the northeast (Handbook of Texas Online 2008) and flows through two artificial
4

reservoirs, Mountain Creek Lake and Joe Pool Lake. The John Penn Branch diverges southeast
from Mountain Creek approximately 4.5 miles southwest of Joe Pool Lake. A north–southtrending intermittent channel of the branch extends through the central portion of the project area.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The project area falls at the interface of the Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford
Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1987). The general soil association is the EddyStephen-Austin made up of very shallow, shallow, and moderately deep, gently sloping to
moderately steep, loamy and clayey upland soils. Soils in the area include Austin-Lewisville
complex, 5 to 8 percent slopes, eroded; Eddy clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Eddy clay loam, 3
to 8 percent slopes; Eddy-Brackett complex, 8 to 20 percent slopes; Ferris-Heiden complex, 5 to
12 percent slopes; and Heiden clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes (Coffee et al. 1980).
The Austin-Lewisville complex consists of approximately 50 percent Austin soils, 30 percent
Lewisville soils, and 20 minor soils. The Austin series is made up of moderately deep, welldrained, clayey soils formed in soft chalky limestone. Lewisville series soils are also welldrained clayey soils; however, they tend to be deeper and arose from ancient stream terrace
alluvium (Coffee et al. 1980).
The Eddy-Brackett complex is composed of roughly 50 percent Eddy soils, 30 percent Brackett
soils, and 20 percent minor soils. Both the Eddy and Brackett series are shallow and very
shallow, well-drained loamy soils formed in soft chalky limestone (Coffee et al. 1980).
The Ferris-Heiden complex includes about 60 percent Ferris soils, 20 percent Heiden soils, and
20 percent minor soils. Ferris soils are deep, well-drained, sloping and strongly sloping clayey
soils formed in clayey marine sediment on uplands. Heiden soils are similar in depth, texture,
and origin to Ferris soils, although they are less sloping and tend to occur on ridgetops, valleys,
and the lower portion of slopes, whereas Ferris soils are more common on steep slopes (Coffee et
al. 1980).

CLIMATE
The Northcentral Texas region has a warm temperate, subtropical, and humid climate that is
generally mild; periods of extremely hot and cold weather are usually limited in duration. The
average temperature is 65.4 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). Summers are hot with maximum
temperatures often in excess of 90°F. Winter weather begins in late November and ends in late
February and is relatively mild. The first freezing temperature of the season usually occurs in late
October or November and the last is usually in March. The coldest month, January, averages
approximately 35.4°F as a daily minimum and 55.6°F as a daily maximum. Yearly rainfall
averages 33.7 inches and is fairly evenly distributed; the maximum rainfall occurs in April and
May and the minimum in August. Some of this rainfall occurs in the form of heavy
thunderstorms, with rapid runoff that allows only limited absorption of water by the soil.
Snowfall is rare, averaging 2 inches per year (Coffee et al 1980:1–2).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURE HISTORY

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Four major reports concerning the archeology of the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987, 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize the history of
archeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the cultural-historical
framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have resulted in recording numerous sites, it is apparent that much research remains
to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988:27–29), much of the excavation effort within the upper
Trinity River basin has focused on reservoir development, especially along the East Fork
(Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966) and the Elm
Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985).
Research on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, west of Dallas, has largely centered on Lewisville
Lake and Lake Ray Roberts, farther north. As with Lake Lavon, R. L. Stephenson (1949, 1950)
surveyed the area of Lewisville Lake (then known as Garza-Little Elm Reservoir) in 1948. At
least three sites (41DN5, 41DN6, and 41DN12) were tested by Stephenson, but the results were
never published (Prikryl 1990). Subsequently, as the dam was being constructed, local
avocational archeologists found and excavated the Lewisville site (41DN72), an apparent PaleoIndian occupation site that yielded a Clovis point in association with extinct fauna and apparent
hearths with radiocarbon dates of greater than 37,000 years ago (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958,
1961). Further work conducted at the site in 1979 and 1980, while unpublished, indicates that the
site is indeed of Clovis age, but that the early dates were derived from lignite coal, not from an
early habitation erroneously attributed to the site (Prikryl 1990). More recent work at Lake
Lewisville has included a shoreline survey conducted by the Richland Archeological Society
(Nunley 1973) and a survey of the lake peripheries by the North Texas State University (now
known as University of North Texas [UNT]; Lebo and Brown 1990), test excavations of 23
prehistoric and 16 historic sites by UNT (Brown and Lebo 1991), and data recovery excavations
at three historic and five prehistoric sites (Ferring and Yates 1998; Lebo 1995a). Farther north
along the Elm Fork, research at Lake Ray Roberts began in 1972 with a reconnaissance survey
(Bousman and Verrett 1973), followed by several intensive surveys of the lake area (Skinner
1982a), site testing (Prikryl and Yates 1987; Skinner 1982b), and finally data recovery
excavations at 26 historic and 12 prehistoric sites (Ferring and Yates 1997; Lebo 1995b; Skinner
and Baird 1985). Recent investigations at the Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479) on the Elm Fork
6

have revealed cultural deposits dated to 11,550 years before present [B.P.], which are among the
oldest known in North America (Ferring 1989). Work within the Elm Fork valley unconnected
with either of these two reservoirs includes field school excavations by the University of Texas at
Arlington at the Northlake site (41DL234) on Grapevine Creek in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975);
a summary of Elm Fork prehistory based on excavated data and surface collections (Prikryl
1990); data recovery excavations at site 41DL270, along Denton Creek (Anthony and Brown
1994); and several smaller survey and evaluation projects (Hunt and Peter 1997a; Hunt et al.
1991, 1995; Hunt, White, and Gaither 1996; Skinner and Kent 1998).
Research along the West Fork of the Trinity River at Joe Pool Lake provided the initial
assemblage data necessary for a basic understanding of prehistoric adaptations in western Dallas
and Tarrant counties. Located on Mountain Creek in southwest Dallas County, Joe Pool Lake
was originally known as Lakeview Reservoir. Fieldwork began in 1977 with a survey that
recorded 42 sites, dating to the Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic periods, within the project
area (Skinner and Connors 1979). Test excavations were then undertaken at 15 prehistoric and
eight historic sites (Ferring and Reese 1996; Raab, Bruseth, and McIntyre 1980; Raab et al.
1982). Finally, data recovery excavations were conducted from 1984 to 1986 at six prehistoric
and 13 historic sites (Jurney et al. 1988; Peter and McGregor 1988). Other excavations along the
West Fork have included limited excavations at the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987);
sites 41TR119 (Edwards and Peter 1991), and 41TR138 in Fort Worth (Largent et al. 1994; Peter
et al. 1998); and the Fountain site (41TR136) in Arlington (Hanson and Kvernes 1997). In
addition, numerous small cultural resources surveys and site evaluations have been conducted
within the West Fork basin (Austin 1993; Brown 1988; Edwards 1991; Hunt 1991, 1997; Hunt
and Krapf 1996; Hunt and Peter 1993a, 1993b, 1995, 1997a, 1997b, 1997c, 1998; Hunt et al.
1993, 1994; 1996; Peter and Cliff 1988; Peter and Gaither 1990; Peter et al. 1994).
Another major reservoir study was undertaken south of Dallas at Richland-Chambers Reservoir.
The area was originally included in the proposed Tennessee Colony Reservoir, which was to be
constructed on the Trinity River below Dallas (Chamberlin 1972; Richner 1982; Richner and
Bagot 1978; Richner and Lee 1976, 1977) but was later cancelled. Dams were planned on both
Richland and Tehuacana creeks, and a preliminary overview of the archeological resources was
prepared (Burton and Connors 1979). When the project was reduced to the Richland Creek
impoundment, it became known as the Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Fieldwork by Southern
Methodist University included a survey of the project area in 1980, during which 911 sites were
discovered, followed by the subsequent evaluation of 270 of the sites (Archaeology Research
Program [ARP] 1982; Raab, Moir, and McGregor 1980, 1981). Mitigation through data recovery
was conducted at 15 prehistoric and 38 historic sites during four field seasons from June 1982 to
December 1984 (Bruseth and Martin, eds. 1987; Bruseth and Moir 1987; Jurney and Moir, eds.
1987; McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Moir and Jurney 1987).
Recent large cultural resources management projects within the city of Dallas include excavations
at site 41DL279 in downtown Dallas adjacent to the historic flood plain of the Trinity River
(Jurney and Andrews 1994) and Freedman’s Cemetery (Peter et al. 2000), as well as research for
the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) rail lines. Cultural resources work related to DART
projects in the downtown Dallas and Oak Cliff areas have included both archeological and
architectural investigations (Adovasio 1992; ARP 1989, 1991; Dorward and Weston 1990; Jurney
and Moir 1987; Jurney et al. 1990, 1991; Moir, Dorward, and Winchell 1991; Myra L. Frank &
Associates 1988a, 1988b, 1988c, 1988d, 1990, 1993; Myra L. Frank & Associates and
ArchiTexas 1988; Skinner et al. 1994; Skinner, Whorton, Trask, Scott, Caran, and Dillon 1996;
Weston and Dorward 1990; Winchell and Dorward 1991).

In addition to these projects, Dallas County has undergone many cultural resources surveys and
evaluations within recent years, several of which have been in or near the flood plain of the main
branch of the Trinity River (Bennett et al. 1981; Cliff et al. 1999; Peter et al. 1991; Peter,
Shepard, and Hunt 1994; Skinner et al. 1990, 1991; Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996; Trask et
al. 1997). During 1974 and 1975, UNT conducted an archeological reconnaissance within the
flood plain of Fivemile Creek (McCormick 1976). Six sites were investigated during this project.
In 1997, GMI conducted an archeological, architectural, and geoarcheological evaluation of the
area of the proposed Dallas Floodway Extension, to run from the existing Dallas Floodway south
to Interstate 20 (Cliff et al. 1998). GMI later tested seven (eventually condensed to six)
prehistoric sites and one historic site within the proposed Dallas Floodway Extension in 1998 and
1999 (Buysse 2000).

CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

Prehistoric Period
Prikryl (1987) established a generalized prehistoric chronological framework of six periods for
the upper Trinity River basin. Investigations at Lewisville Lake in Denton County (Lebo and
Brown 1990) and Joe Pool Lake in Dallas County (Peter and McGregor 1988) refined this
framework to a four-period model. The overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at
both lakes, however, remains to be demonstrated. The generalized chronology presented here
(Table 1) reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from both sets of investigations
but is based primarily on the model provided by Peter and McGregor (1988). Brown and Lebo
(1991) and Lebo and Brown (1990) present a chronology keyed specifically for Lewisville Lake,
but it closely follows the chronology proposed for Joe Pool. The chronology proposed by
Skinner and Baird (1985) for Lake Ray Roberts and surrounding Northcentral Texas is very
similar, except that it replaces “Late Prehistoric” with “Neo-American” and lacks a Protohistoric
stage.

(after Peter and McGregor 1988)

The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts. The
Field Ranch site (Jensen 1968) along the upper Elm Fork is a primary example of typical site
contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks
8

in the Cross Timbers, and Dalton, Midland, San Patrice, Golondrina, and Scottsbluff points have
been recovered as well (Lebo and Brown 1990:16). The Lewisville site (41DN72; Crook and
Harris 1957, 1958, 1961) and the Aubrey site at Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring 1989) are the bestknown Paleo-Indian sites within the region. The Lewisville site (41DN72) has been controversial
since its discovery because the initial radiocarbon samples collected there provided dates in the
37,000 B.P. range. Later work by Stanford (1981), however, resolved the controversy concerning
the date of the occupation. It appears that the presence of naturally occurring lignite, as either a
fuel in these hearths or as an inadvertent inclusion, accurately dates the coal several thousand
years earlier than the human occupation using the coal. Consequently, the usually accepted date
of 10,000–12,000 years ago for Clovis-period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for
the first human occupation of Northcentral Texas.
Although settlement-subsistence strategy data for early occupants remain limited, excavations at
the well-preserved Clovis-period Aubrey site (41DN479) at Lake Ray Roberts northwest of
Lewisville Lake indicate that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game animals alone; rather,
the entire range of prairie and forest species was used (Ferring 1989). Whether this pattern of a
more generalized foraging subsistence system as characteristic of a Clovis adaptation in the
Eastern Woodlands contrasts with a subsistence focus on now-extinct, big-game species as
characteristic of a Plains adaptation remains to be documented.
The subsequent Folsom complex is generally considered to be less dispersed than Clovis, and
Folsom sites are most common in the Western Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. Although a
Folsom presence in the Trinity River region is rare, several Folsom points have been found in
undated contexts in the Trinity River valley and vicinity. Likewise, Dalton projectile points have
been found on sites in the major stream valleys of Dallas and surrounding counties, although they
too are rare compared with many other later point types. The Dalton tradition occurred at the end
of the Paleo-Indian period and typically is found toward the east. The distinctive Dalton point
and sometimes chipped-stone woodworking tools (Dalton adzes) characterize these sites. All
other components of the Paleo-Indian toolkit are found in Dalton sites as well. By Dalton times,
the megafauna of the Pleistocene were extinct, and people used a hunting and wild-plant-food
collecting strategy that adapted to the emerging post-glacial, early Holocene environment. Like
artifacts from the earlier Paleo-Indian occupations, Dalton points are often found on the surface
as isolated finds.
Other late Paleo-Indian projectile points such as the San Patrice and Scottsbluff types are also
found in the Dallas vicinity along the upper Trinity River. San Patrice points resemble Dalton
points, although they exhibit unique characteristics of being wider, with wide side notches and a
concave base, and appear to be coeval or slightly earlier. Both Dalton and San Patrice are likely
in situ developments from a Clovis fluted complex (Story 1990). They are also likely the product
of increased regional specialization during the turbulent beginnings of Holocene climatic
conditions. The core area for San Patrice points is eastern Texas and Louisiana (Story 1990).
Scottsbluff points, most commonly associated with the western plains Cody complex, are
sufficiently common in the area to generate hypotheses of plains population movements into the
eastern woodland fringes in response to climatic stress (Story 1990).
An understanding of the Archaic period in the Trinity River drainage is limited by the lack of
major excavations on single-component sites. This is particularly true for sites of the Early and
Middle Archaic periods. Most evidence of an Archaic presence in Dallas County comes from
surface finds of the Gary, Elam, Edgewood, Ellis, Godley, and Yarbrough diagnostic projectile
9

point styles. Skinner and Baird (1985) suggest that the general paucity of significant sites in the
vicinity of Lake Ray Roberts is due to the fact that the area was a marginal environment, a habitat
where food resources were scarce. In this model, populations (both Archaic and otherwise)
occupied the area only during specific seasons of the year, and then only long enough to collect
and process mast resources—specifically, acorns. Investigations along the West Fork by others
(Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986) indicate that primary contexts for Early and
Middle Archaic sites occur deeply buried within flood plain alluvium. Artifacts from these
periods are found on terrace surfaces and are frequently mixed with later materials. In fact, the
initial treatment of the Archaic period (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the
Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon mixed materials from such terrace contexts.
Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized as acceptable for
Northcentral Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Lake Ray Roberts (Skinner
and Baird 1985) indicate that the Late Archaic period is characterized by assemblages left by
small bands of highly mobile, foraging, hunters and gatherers, who only briefly used any
particular site. These sites were apparently reoccupied numerous times on a seasonal basis. Deer
and numerous small mammals were the primary food resources. The documentation of large pits
associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland/Chambers Creek drainage (Bruseth and
Martin 1987) suggests that important sociopolitical changes may have occurred during this time
period. Unfortunately, the significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent
documentation.
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin is marked by the
initial appearance of arrow points. The date of A.D. 700 for this period is based upon dated
contexts to the west in the Brazos River drainage. Lynott (1977) suggests that the Late
Prehistoric period may be divided into an early and a late phase, a division accepted by many
researchers (e.g., Lebo and Brown 1990; Skinner and Baird 1985). The early phase is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and a
continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the Late Archaic period. The late phase
reflects a Southern Plains influence with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the
Henrietta focus, various unstemmed and side-notched triangular points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell,
Washita), and the Perdiz point. Evidence of horticulture and the procurement of bison also
appears in sites of this later period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikryl’s
(1987) more recent assessment of the Late Prehistoric period largely follows that of Lynott
(1977).
Investigation of the Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) has resulted in a
reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site yielded house structures,
roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates
from several features indicate that the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth
century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan
occupation. Consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred during a
middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to
the region before this time.
Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive
change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented. However,
recent analysis of a Native American burial of a 50-year old woman, salvaged from site 41DL373
10

along Spring Creek in northeastern Dallas County, also suggests maize consumption (Peter and
Clow 2000). Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155–1275,
and a carbon isotope ratio of -17.7 ‰ suggests that maize was consumed, but did not form a
major part of her diet (Peter and Clow 2000). These indications of maize consumption contrast
with a small grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site
(41DL369; Cliff et al. 1996) in Dallas County. This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of
the East Fork of the Trinity River), yielded remains of at least four individuals, radiocarbon-dated
by bone collagen to cal A.D. 1010–1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although
shell beads and a shell gorget were present. A carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 ‰ suggests that the
group’s diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Since the Harbor Pointe burials date
slightly earlier than the corn remains from Cobb-Pool and the burial from 41DL373, it is possible
that maize agriculture was introduced to the Dallas area ca. A.D. 1200. Conversely, this same
evidence may indicate that groups in the Dallas area practiced diverse subsistence patterns that
relied on corn to various extents.
Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the Protohistoric period
occupations in the upper Trinity River basin. Although several named Protohistoric archeological
complexes (Norteno, Garza, Tierra Blanca, Wheeler-Edwards) have been defined mostly for the
regions to the west of the Trinity River basin, no archeological sites affiliated with these
complexes are known to exist in the Dallas region. Historically, various bands of the Tonkawa,
Wichita, Caddo, Lipan Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche all are likely to have traversed the area.
Exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data, however, are almost nonexistent.
Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a limited number of sites, no
Protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated, and characterizations of the Native American
adaptations during this time period in Northcentral Texas are conjectural at best. A lack of
documentary evidence, together with a lack of interest among ethnologists and archeologists, has
contributed to this situation.

Historic Occupation/Utilization
The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have occurred in 1542 when the
remnants of the de Soto expedition, led by Luís de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered the area in an
attempt to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the expedition crossed
Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although others place the route much farther to
the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson 1986; Schambach 1989;
Weber 1992). A consistent European presence in the region did not occur until the early 1700s,
when the Wichita moved from northern Oklahoma and reestablished large villages on the Red
River. French traders from Louisiana who had ties to the Wichita along the Arkansas River
retained their contacts and began to move west along the Red River. The Spanish considered this
French incursion to be a threat to the security of New Spain, and they responded by redoubling
efforts to counterbalance the French influence with the Native Americans in East and
Northcentral Texas. Spanish efforts to control the Native American trade with the French
suffered a major set-back when the Wichita and their allied tribes attacked and sacked the
Spanish mission of San Sabá de la Santa Cruz in Menard County and repulsed a retaliatory
military expedition at the Wichita villages (later called “Spanish Fort” because of Spanish
artifacts and fort remnants) on the Red River in 1758–1759. It has been argued that this defeat
put an end to Spanish military and missionary expansion to the north (Weddle 1964, 1965).

11

This military defeat gave the Wichita considerable autonomy from direct Spanish control in
Northcentral Texas. Nevertheless, the Spanish continued the attempts to curtail trade by
controlling the French traders coming into East Texas from Louisiana. These efforts persisted
until 1763, when France ceded Louisiana to Spain under the Treaty of Paris.
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained under first Spanish and then Mexican control
until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, Northcentral Texas was
beyond the direct sphere of the conflict involving the fight for Texas independence. That conflict
played out primarily in South and Central Texas in 1836. The most significant change involved
decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the second president of Texas, to make the settlers of the
Texas Republic safe from marauding Native Americans by adopting an Indian removal or
extermination program. Active efforts to drive off or kill off Native Americans from Texas had
been under way for some time. In one instance in 1837, a group of Texas Rangers under the
command of Lt. A. B. Van Benthuysen camped on Turtle Creek after conducting raids on Indians
to the north (Maxwell 2002). Subsequently, many native groups who used the Trinity River basin
relocated north of the Red River.
The first European Americans to settle in the Northcentral Texas region were primarily from
Arkansas Territory. The first permanent settlement along the Trinity River in the Dallas area,
Bird’s Fort, was established by Captain Jonathan Bird and located along the West Fork of the
Trinity River in present-day Arlington. The fort consisted of a blockhouse and several log
buildings, and served mostly as a trading station. Additional families joined the initial occupants
of the fort in the fall of 1841, but the fort was abandoned by the spring of 1842. Bird’s Fort was
not used again until the summer of 1843 when Sam Houston, president of the Republic of Texas,
attempted to meet with the Indian tribes and establish a peace treaty. The treaty was signed on
September 29, 1843, with representatives of the Delaware, Chickasaw, Waco, Keechi, Caddo,
Ionic, Biloxi, and Cherokee present (Garrett 1972; Sergeant 1953).
Simultaneous with the establishment of Bird’s Fort in 1840 in the vicinity of Arlington, John
Neely Bryan reconnoitered the Dallas area to determine its suitability for the establishment of a
trading post. By the time Bryan returned in 1842, troops of the Republic of Texas had removed
the Native American groups with whom he had intended trading. As a result, Bryan became
determined to found a settlement in the area where downtown Dallas is today. To further this
goal, Bryan invited the residents of Bird’s Fort to join his new settlement.
Meanwhile, in 1841, the Republic of Texas granted a large portion of land to the Texas
Emigration and Land Company (TELC), which hoped to encourage settlement of Northcentral
Texas. The grants distributed to settlers by the TELC became known collectively as the Peters
Colony. Most of the Peters Colony settlers held property north of present-day Dallas, land which
they held in that name until 1852 when disputes between the TELC and the settlers caused some
of the settlers to band together in a fight to defend their title to the land they had settled.
In 1845, voters in the future Dallas County approved the annexation of Texas into the United
States by an overwhelming vote of 29 to 3 (Maxwell 2002). In 1846, Bryan began collaborations
with Colonel John C. McCoy, a former agent of the TELC, to promote settlement in Dallas. The
two men successfully lobbied the Texas legislature for the creation of Dallas County, and the
small settlement of Dallas was temporarily assigned as the county seat. In 1850, county-wide
elections were held to select a location for the permanent county seat (McDonald 1978:10).

12

Despite its position as the county seat, the town of Dallas grew slowly during the 1850s. Yet, it
did offer many of the basic establishments associated with market towns: general stores, hotels,
stables, a sawmill, and other businesses (McDonald 1978:7–18). This slow growth was common
for interior South, antebellum market cities. Characteristically, antebellum Southern cities only
existed as markets for the surrounding agricultural industry. Accepting this view of Southern
urban development, the evolution of Dallas clearly fits the model (Goldfield 1989). One unique
aspect of Dallas’s early development was the immigration of a small band of Utopians who were
followers of the French Socialist philosopher, Francois Marie Charles Fourier. They established
the colony of La Reunion across the river from Dallas. These European immigrants differed from
the common settlers because they were more educated and provided the citizens of Dallas with
the talents of skilled craftsmen and artisans, something not usually found in developing western
urban areas. Within five years, the colony failed, but members of La Reunion moved to Dallas
where their cultural influence shaped the area for many years (Pratt 1995).
The development of Dallas had not progressed at the rate that Bryan desired. By 1849, he had
sold only 86 plots, and he had lost money in the Gold Rush of California. In 1852, Bryan sold his
remaining Dallas landholdings to Alexander Cockrell for $7,000. It was under the boosterism of
Cockrell that Dallas began to expand. Cockrell’s vision for Dallas has afforded him the title of
Dallas’s first capitalist. Unfortunately, he died in 1858, leaving his wife, Sarah Horton Cockrell,
to continue with his plans (McDonald 1978:14–15). Considered to be one of the most influential
developers of early Dallas, Sarah Horton Cockrell developed and owned mills, real estate, and
hotels. In addition, she was responsible for the construction of the first major iron suspension
bridge across the Trinity River, which opened in 1872. Her efforts made her one of the wealthiest
and most influential residents of the region. She owned approximately one-fourth of downtown
Dallas and many other properties at the time of her death in 1892 (Enstam 2002).
Much of the region around Dallas was largely rural, and corn was far more popular than cotton.
Initially, Dallas County had fewer slaves and slaveholders than many other counties in Texas.
Only some 207 slaves are listed for Dallas in the 1850 census, but a mere decade later, the
number of slaves increased five-fold to 1,074, owned by 228 slaveholders (Maxwell 2002). As
might be expected, Dallas’s citizens overwhelmingly voted to join the Confederacy in 1861, and
10 companies, ultimately comprising more than 1,300 men, fought for the South in the Civil War.
Due to the relatively remote setting of Dallas, many Southerners came to the Dallas area to avoid
the ravages of war.
By the end of the war, Dallas County had almost 13,500 residents. All mercantile goods shipped
to Dallas had to travel overland by wagon. One of the less successful plans to supply the
expanding needs of Dallas was envisioned by Alexander Cockrell, who promoted the use of the
Trinity River as a transportation route. This idea was by no means new, though previous attempts
to use the river had met with little success. Because all earlier efforts to navigate the Trinity
River had failed, civic leaders soon turned their attention to attracting the railroad to Dallas. It
was the impact of the railroad that had the greatest influence on the development of the region, on
both sides of the Trinity River. North Texans had been endeavoring to obtain a rail line since
before the Civil War, but with little success. In 1872, the Houston and Texas Central (H&TC)
Railroad was seeking a terminus in North Texas. To gain the highly valued railroad, citizens of
Dallas offered H&TC $5,000, a right-of-way through the town, and 115 acres of land. In 1873,
Dallas further secured its role as a regional transportation hub when the Texas and Pacific (T&P)
Railway arrived (Davis and Peterson 1991). The intersection of these two lines brought the much
anticipated progress and growth to Dallas because this was the first crossing of two major
13

railroads in the state of Texas. The 1875 Directory of the City of Dallas claimed that Dallas was
“an inviting field for capital and labor. . . . Untold millions of rich acres lie awaiting the touch of
industry . . . [and the railroads] will inaugurate a new era in the commerce of the world”
(Butterfield and Rundlett 1979:16). The town of Cedar Hill emerged in the 1850s along a branch
of the Chisolm Trail, the cattle trail from the Rio Grande to central Kansas, southwest of Dallas.
Population grew gradually until the mid-to-late 1900s when factors such as the establishment of
Northwood Institute and construction of Joe Pool Lake encouraged a growing number of
residents and supporting businesses (Stowers 2008).

METHODOLOGY

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a search of available archival data was undertaken. The purpose of this
background research was to identify all known archeological investigations, archeological sites,
and historic properties (i.e., cultural resources eligible for or listed on the National Register of
Historic Places) that might be situated within or near the project area. The results of the research
were used to guide the field methods, to determine the areas in which previously recorded sites
would be encountered, and to locate landforms with the highest probability to retain archeological
deposits. The data also served as a contextual framework so that any newly recorded sites could
be evaluated for significance.
Site records obtained from the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) were consulted to obtain information on previous investigations and known sites
within a 1-mile (mi; 1.6-kilometer [km]) radius of the project area. Several surveys associated
with Joe Pool Lake (Lakeview Lake) that date back to 1979 (Skinner and Connors 1979; Raab et
al. 1982) and the Penn Farm in particular (Jurney et al. 1988) were documented. Another
investigation at the Penn Farm occurred including some monitoring by Texas Parks and Wildlife
in 1995, though no report information was available on the Atlas. A survey of 110 acres for the
Cedar Mountain Preserve adjacent to the current project area on the west was conducted by AR
Consultants, Inc., in 1998 resulting in the recordation of a twentieth-century artifact scatter (site
41DL378) attributed to a 1900 rental house location shown on a historic map (Kent and Skinner
1998). A survey along FM 1382 prior to its widening was conducted by Texas Department of
Transportation in 1988 and recorded in the Atlas in 1993; no sites were illustrated on the Altas
within the project boundaries . A large acreage survey was conducted in 1984 due north of FM
1382 and the current project area for an entity recorded in the Atlas as HCRS; no additional
information was available. The Mobley Cemetery, a small well-maintained, fenced, historic,
family cemetery, is located approximately 250 m west of the southernmost end of the current
project area.
Maps, including topographic quadrangles and early road maps, and aerial photographs that might
yield locations of historic sites were also examined. No structures are illustrated within the
project area on the 1936 and 1961 editions of the General Highway Map of Texas: Dallas
15

County, Rockwall County, nor are any visible on a 1975 aerial photograph of the area published in
the Soil Survey of Dallas County, Texas. However, factors such as tree cover and degree of
resolution might explain the absence of any obvious structures. On the other hand, all of the
structures within the project area on the Cedar Hill, Texas (1959; photorevised 1982), USGS
topographic quadrangle are illustrated in purple ink and indicate structures built between 1959,
when the map was field checked, and 1978, the date of the aerial photographs that were the basis
for the photorevised edition. Consequently, none of these structures is of historic significance
due to its recent age.

ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODS
Geo-Marine performed an intensive pedestrian archeological survey that consisted of examination
of the drainage cutbanks and judgmental shovel testing of areas with good potential for
containing intact archeological deposits. Judgmental, rather than systematic, shovel testing was
performed due to the preponderance of steep slopes and thin, ancient soils within the project area,
which are not highly conducive to buried archeological deposits. At the time of the survey, only
one proposed trail was marked, and its course could be accurately followed. The locations of the
remaining proposed trails could not be as accurately estimated, and that portion of the project area
was traversed in roughly north–south transects at 15-meter (m; 49-foot [ft]) intervals, following
the course of the drainage that bisects the project area. Two professional archeologists walked
over the project area and visually examined the ground surface for archeological materials and
areas suitable for shovel testing. Shovel tests were approximately 30 centimeters (cm; 12 inches
[in]) in diameter and were excavated to 80 cm (32 in) below ground surface (bs) or the B horizon,
if it was encountered first. All shovel test fill was sifted through 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware
cloth to identify any subsurface cultural materials that might be present, and data pertaining to
soil color, texture, and content for each shovel test were recorded on a standardized form. When
not severely obstructed by tree cover, shovel test locations were recorded with a Trimble®
GeoXH™ global positioning system (GPS) unit. Drainage cutbanks were examined for
indications of buried archeological deposits or horizons.
Although no artifacts were found and thus none require curation, all notes, forms, and
photographs obtained during this project will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

RESULTS
During the pedestrian survey, 17 shovel tests were excavated in the higher probability areas of the
project area (Figure 3). The extrapolated frequency for the entire 270-acre parcel is 0.06 shovel
tests per acre. Survey standards recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and
approved by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) are only offered for surveys of 200 acres or
less, but the recommended frequency for areas of 101–200 acres is 1 shovel test per 3 acres, 5.3
times the number of shovel tests excavated during the present survey. However, several factors
precluded the need for more extensive shovel testing. Ground surface visibility in many areas
was 30 percent or greater, and, according to the CTA/THC standards, such areas frequently do
not require subsurface investigation. Also, much of the project area occurs on moderate to steep
slopes where past human occupation would have been unlikely and, likewise, is not subject to
mandatory shovel testing. The intermittent stream that passes through the project area is small
and was not likely to have sustained prolonged human habitation, thus suggesting a fairly low
potential for significant archeological sites. In addition, the underlying geology of the proposed
trail system consists of Upper Cretaceous limestone and chalk deposits that predate the presence
of humans in North America, and the relatively thin, and often eroded, soils in this portion of the
project area are not likely to contain substantial, intact archeological deposits. Finally, much of
the project area around the proposed visitors’ center and parking facilities, where the greatest
construction impacts will occur, is disturbed by gravel driveways and previous construction
(Figure 4). In particular, a concrete-lined basin that formerly housed a transmission tower is in
the middle of the proposed location for the visitors’ center and circular driveway (Figure 5). The
basin is approximately 27.3 m (90 ft) in diameter and 4.5 m (15 ft) deep, and the surrounding area
was most likely disturbed by the excavation of the basin. No archeological materials were
observed on the surface of the proposed construction areas, either.
In general, shovel tests were concentrated toward the northeast portion of the property where soils
were typically deeper and more level, although level areas and ridge tops farther south were also
examined for subsurface materials. Soils within the lower elevations of the project area consisted
of dark gray clay loam above lighter gray to brown clay loam, frequently with carbonaceous
inclusions (Table 2). Shovel test profiles on the terraces typically demonstrated grayish brown
clay loam above flaky limestone. No artifacts were observed in the shovel tests. Stream cutbanks
indicated light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam mixed with flaky limestone (Figure 6). No
artifacts, features, or paleosols were visible in the cutbanks, and no sites were identified during
the pedestrian survey.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archeological sites were identified during the present investigation. Much of the terrain
slopes toward a stream that bisects the project area. The steam is relatively minor and was likely
not a reliable source of water on a constant basis. The Upper Cretaceous deposits, through which
the stream cuts, do not demonstrate potential for archeological materials, and shovel testing
within the higher probability portions of the project area produced no evidence of cultural
materials. Low potential for archeological sites is further supported by previous surveys in the
immediate area, including a 110-acre parcel immediately west of the project area, that failed to
identify significant cultural properties. The areas where the most extensive disturbance is
anticipated are already heavily disturbed. Consequently, the potential for archeological sites
within the project area is low, and no further archeological investigations are necessary within the
currently defined project area.
