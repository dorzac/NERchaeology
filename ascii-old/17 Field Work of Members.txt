FIELD WORK OF MEMBERS
Mrs. Eileen E. Alves of El Paso reports that a
museum building is projected for El Paso. During the
spring several burials have been found connected with
what seems to be a pit house culture, located within
thirty miles of El Paso. These were accompanied by
potsherds but no other artifacts.
Frank Bryan of Waco has made extensive
studies of patination, form and geological
distribution of local artifacts, a paper on some of
his finds appears in this number of the Bulletin.
Col. M. L. Crimmins of San Antonio is now at
El Paso and will continue his study of pictographs and
petroglyphs in that section. During the past year he
has given lectures on pictographs and petroglyphs at
San Antonio, Abilene, College Station, El Paso, and
Austin, Texas. Photographs and other records were
made of pictographs and petroglyphs at Sierra Alta,
Ojo del Alamo and Cornudas del Alamo (Northeast
of El Paso), Texas and Three Rivers and Taos, New
Mexico.
With Roscoe Conkling of El Paso an inspection of
the excavations of Bishop Cap Peak, north of El Paso
was made. Here human bones associated with those
of the ground sloth, American camel, etc., were
found. And with Clyde T. Reed, President of the
Texas Academy of Science, inspection trips were
made to Hueco Tanks, Cornudas and Ojo del
Alamo, all north of El Paso, and to Three Rivers,
New Mexico.
During June, Col. Crimmins was in the east doing
research in the American Museum of Natural History,
and in conference with N. C. Nelson, Curator of
Prehistoric Archaeology of that institution and with
George C. Valliant, Assistant Curator of Mexican
Archaeology.
Henry E. Elrod of Houston is making a comparative
study of the patina of Texas stone artifacts with the
eoliths and paleoliths of Europe. A large part of his
researches have been done along the Coast of Texas
in the vicinity of Rockport, where he has recently found
42 beads made from human bones which still retain
their coat of red paint.

Dr. W. C. Holden of Lubbock is continuing his
investigations of the Texas Panhandle area.
C. A. Howard of Dallas reports carrying on
researches in California Museums during the past
summer on certain Quatenary animals, remains of
which frequently occur in his section.
A. T. Jackson of Mineola has completed a
voluminous preliminary study of Texas pottery and has
carried on investigations in the vicinity of Llano. He
spent two weeks in Wood County and considerable
time in Camp County with Dr. J. E. Pearce of the
University of Texas, where numerous vessels of
apparently Caddoan origin were excavated.
Geo. C. Martin, Wendell H. Potter, and E. H.
Sellers, of Rockport, and Alexander Cox and John
B. Dunn of Corpus Christi are continuing their
investigations of the Coastal region. Mr. Martin reports
many new sites have been recorded and one shell heap
excavated. During the past year Messrs. Martin and
Potter have published the second part of their
Preliminary Survey of that section, and report the third
part will soon be ready for publication.
During the past summer, Dr. J. E. Pearce, of the
Department of Anthropology, University of Texas, has
investigated a shell mound containing a burial, located
by Messrs. Martin and Potter, and Dr. E. H.
Sellards, head of the Texas Geological Survey has
made a reconnaissance and press report on a site,
fully described by Mr. Martin in this issue of the
Bulletin, and which was identified by Mr. Martin
some time ago as a site of greater age than the other
Coastal sites in that vicinity.
Mrs. Annie Moran, of Weatherford, has spent
several months at Deming, New Mexico, gathering
local material. Mrs. Moran has accumulated a fine
collection of pottery and flints.
Dr. Cyrus N. Ray of Abilene reports the
discovery of many deeply buried hearth sites, some
of which are described in this issue of the Bulletin.
