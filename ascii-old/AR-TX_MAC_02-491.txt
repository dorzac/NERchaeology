ABSTRACT
On November 9, 10, 15, 2006, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of an approximately ½ acre tract in Harris County, Texas.
The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare management recommendations
regarding any identified resources. The investigations were conducted for S & B Infrastructure,
Ltd., and the Texas Department of Transportation (CSJ 0912-72-002), under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4313. An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface (shovel test and backhoe trench) examination. A total of 11
shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were excavated. The tests documented significant layers
of modern fill and disturbance. No evidence of archeological or historic remains or features was
identified. Consequently, no further archeological investigations are recommended. In the event
that archeological deposits or features should be encountered during construction, work should
cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
169.2 m) in length and has a ROW of 60 ft
(ca. 18.3 m). The proposed bridge will be
60.25 ft (ca. 18.4 m) wide, 555 ft (ca. 169.2
m) in length and have a ROW of 70 ft (ca.
21.3 m). It is expected that the depth of
impact will be no more than 6 ft (ca. 1.8 m).
The overall length of the project is expected
to be 950 ft (ca. 289.6 m). The project will
extend from 260 ft (ca. 79.2 m) east of the
intersection of Richey Road and West Harris
Avenue to 1210 ft (ca. 368.8 m) east of the
same intersection. This APE is based on
typical section maps provided to Moore
Archeological Consulting by S & B
Infrastructure.

On November 9, 10, 15, 2006,
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation of an approximately ½ acre
tract in Harris County, Texas.
The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 05115) were conducted for S & B
Infrastructure, Ltd., and the Texas
Department of Transportation (CSJ 091272-002), under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4313.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel
test
and
backhoe
trench)
examination (Figure 2; see Appendix 1 for
details). A total of 11 shovel tests and two
backhoe trenches were excavated. The
investigations were conducted by project
field archeologist Randy Ferguson and field
technician Kelly Schexnayder, under the
supervision of project archeologist Douglas
G. Mangum. Roger Moore served as the
project’s principal investigator.

The project area is depicted on the
Pasadena, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The proposed
project consists of the replacement of an
extant four-lane concrete bridge on West
Harris Avenue where it crosses Vince
Bayou. The project was an intensive linear
survey during which all work occurred
within the existing TxDOT right-of-way
(ROW). No right of entry was required.
The existing structure is a 4-lane
bridge 50 ft (ca. 15.2 m) in width, 555 ft (ca.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Hydrology
The project area is located on a
section of Vince Bayou, approximately 3 km
upstream (south) from its confluence with
Buffalo Bayou/Houston Ship Channel. The
surrounding area is heavily urbanized with
both residential and industrial development,
and significant portions of Vince Bayou
appear to have been somewhat straightened
and channelized.
Flora and Fauna
The county lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. San Jacinto
County is situated within the pine-oak
subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the
dominant floral species of the pine-oak
forest subdivision as loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica). Hardwood forests are found
on lowlands within the Austroriparian and
are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra), and
other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as
well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss
(Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra).

The property is depicted on sheet
115 of the Soil Survey of Harris County,
Texas (Wheeler 1976). The single soil type
identified in the project area is VamontUrban land complex (Vn). Urban lands soils
consist of sediments that have been
impacted by urban development, and have
often been altered or covered by buildings
and other structures (e.g., dwellings, office
buildings, streets, parking lots, etc.).
Vamont soils have a high clay content, and
are described as somewhat poorly drained
with slow surface runoff (Wheeler et al.
1976:22). The entire Project Area falls
within the PALM Unit 1, which
recommends shovel testing and backhoe
trenching (Abbott 2001).

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus

Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92°F (33°C), while
winter temperatures average 64°F (18°C).

snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback

common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and

southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around

territory, the nomadic populations were able

to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated Narváez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated

establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A
significant
amount
of
archaeological work has been conducted
along nearby Clear Creek. The Texas
Archeological Survey (McGuff and Cox
1973) conducted a survey of the entire Clear
Creek drainage including its major
tributaries, Marys, Cowart, and Chigger
Creeks. This survey was performed for the
Galveston District, U. S. Army Corps of
Engineers (COE) in preparation for a
proposed flood control project. Although it
is not entirely clear how intensive this
survey was, some twenty-two previously
unrecorded sites were found during the
investigation. At least sixteen of these sites
ranged from 50’-400’ from the banks of
Clear Creek. The remaining sites were
described as adjacent to the creek. From
these numbers it is clear that the survey was
not limited to the immediate banks of Clear
Creek. An additional 56 previously recorded
sites (all but two prehistoric) were relocated
or investigated to see if they would be
affected by the proposed flood control
project. The nearest of these sites to the
current Project Area was more than twenty
kilometers (twelve miles) to the east.
Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. (1981)
conducted a survey of the Clear Creek
Regional Park in Harris County. No sites
were found during that intensive survey.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in or near (within ½ km) the
project property.
The closest sites to the project area
are historic sites 41HR308 and 41HR309,
both
located
just
downstream,
approximately 2.5 km to the north.
41HR308 is located at the confluence of
Vince Bayou and Little Vince Bayou and is
the presumed location of Vince’s Bridge,
which was burned down prior to the Battle
of San Jacinto in order to cut off retreat by
Mexican forces. 41HR309 is a historic
cemetery located on the banks of Vince
Bayou.
No prehistoric archeological sites
have been identified along Vince Bayou.
However, the project is located in an area
that contains a number of stream systems,
including Armand Bayou, Horsepen Bayou,
Taylor Bayou, Clear Creek, Mud Lake, and
Clear Lake. Previous investigations along
many of these watersources have
documented a high density of prehistoric
occupation.

At least six other studies have been
conducted along the Clear Creek drainage
basin. These include one survey (Howard
and Freeman 1992), two reconnaissance
(Howard and Freeman 1990, and Howard,
Freeman, and Bousman 1992), and three site
investigations (Hines 1992, Kuttruff 1993,
W. Moore 1994). The closest of these was
more than 15 miles to the east, and all others

boundary further west.
Other investigations which have
been performed in the general are of the

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
To prospect for deeply buried sites,
two backhoe trenches (BHTs 1, 2) were
excavated, one on each side of the bayou.
BHT 1 was placed on the west bank of the
stream, 20 m from the water’s edge and 5 m
west of the large berm that runs parallel to
the bayou. Because level ground suitable
for backhoe work was limited, the trench
was partially underneath the bridge and was
oriented parallel with the stream. The trench
measured 3.5 m long and 1 m wide, and
reached a maximum depth of 75 cm. The
trench profile and soil descriptions are
provided in Figure 3. BHT 2 was placed on
the east bank of the stream, along the south
side of West Harris Avenue. The trench
measured 5 m long and 1 m wide, and
reached a maximum depth of 1.5 m. The
trench profile and soil descriptions are
provided in Figure 4.

The fieldwork was conducted on
November 9, 10, 15, 2006, and consisted of
a 100% pedestrian survey that included
systematic
shovel
testing,
backhoe
trenching, and visual examination for
surface exposure of cultural materials.
The project area is depicted on the
Pasadena, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The proposed
project consists of the replacement of an
extant four-lane concrete bridge on West
Harris Avenue where it crosses Vince
Bayou. The project was an intensive linear
survey during which all work occurred
within the existing TxDOT right-of-way
(ROW). No right of entry was required.
A total of 11 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through ¼” mesh (Figure 3;
Appendix 1). Each of the project’s shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. The tests identified the
presence of varying depths of fill and
disturbance related to previous construction
in all areas of the project area.

No prehistoric or historic cultural
materials or features were found in any of
the shovel tests or either of the backhoe
trenches.

RECOMMENDATIONS
An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel
test
and
backhoe
trench)
examination. A total of 11 shovel tests and
two backhoe trenches were excavated. The
tests documented significant layers of
modern fill and disturbance. No evidence of
archeological or historic remains or features
was identified. Consequently, no further
archeological
investigations
are
recommended.
In the event that
archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

On November 9, 10, 15, 2006,
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation of an approximately ½ acre
tract in Harris County, Texas.
The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 05115) were conducted for S & B
Infrastructure, Ltd., and the Texas
Department of Transportation (CSJ 091272-002), under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4313.
