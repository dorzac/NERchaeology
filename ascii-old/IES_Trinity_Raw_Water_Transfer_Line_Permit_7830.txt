ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
for the Trinity Raw Water Transfer Line Project in the City of Dallas, Dallas County,
Texas. As the City of Dallas is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the proposed
project will require coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to
construction, per the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, as
the project will require a Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act Permit from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in association with a Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act (CWA) Nationwide Permit (NWP), portions of the project will be subject to the
provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources that could
be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for
their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All work conformed to 36
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, and 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC)
26, which outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the
ACT.
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologist Kevin Stone on 07
December 2016, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7830. During the IES survey, no
cultural resources were encountered within the 3.56-acre Area of Potential Effects.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All records will be temporarily curated
at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL). No further investigations are warranted prior to
construction. However, if any cultural resources are unearthed during construction, the
operators should immediately stop construction activities in the area, and contact the
project environmental representative to initiate coordination with the THC prior to
resuming any construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area or Area of
Potential Effects (APE), environmental setting, cultural background, and methodology; followed by the
results of the investigations and recommendations. This report serves as the cultural resources report to
satisfy the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).

1.1 Introduction
As the project cultural resources consultant for the City of Dallas, Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) performed a cultural resources inventory to locate any prehistoric or historic-period cultural
resources within the 3.56 acre (1.44 hectare [ha]) APE located between South Great Trinity Forest Way
and the Trinity River in the City of Dallas, Dallas County, Texas. The project is plotted on the Hutchins
7.5-minute series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheet and recent aerial photograph
(Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
During the desktop analysis and background review, conducted prior to the pedestrian survey, it was
determined that the natural landscape had been exposed to a variety of activities that have drastically
affected the soilâs stratigraphic integrity prior to the current project. Observations made from historic
maps and aerial photographs verified that the natural setting, within a significant portion of the APE, had
been altered as a result of agricultural or ranching activities, sand and gravel strip mining, and operation
of a landfill. Regardless, an investigation was conducted to document and assess any undocumented
archeological sites located within the APE that may be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).

1.2 Direct APE
Current plans call for the installation of a raw water transfer line along the northern section of the Trinity
River Trail. The project will span from approximately 0.16-mile southwest of the intersection of South
Great Trinity Forest Way and South Longacre Lane to the Trinity River. The APE will consist of 6,241
feet (1.82 miles) of raw water pipe, a 15-foot wide permanent easement, 123 linear feet of inclined
discharge pipe, a screened water intake structure, and a valve vault. An intake pump station will be
constructed on the bank of the Trinity River, which will include a 125-foot by 40-foot temporary
workspace for constructing the station and installing rock rip-rap. Additional temporary workspace will
be needed outside of the permanent easement, consisting of a 7.5-foot wide temporary easement. Project
engineering designs are located in Appendix A.

1.3 Indirect APE
As the project requires federal permitting from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), indirect
visual effects must be considered to satisfy Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA). However, since all elements of the project will remain at or below the groundâs surface, visual
impacts were not assessed. No other indirect effects resulted from the proposed project.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
2.1.1 - Climate
Dallas County is in the North-Central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid subtropical
climate and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 40.00 inches. About half of the
rain usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year.
The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year round temperature with the occasional
exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).
2.1.2 - Topographic Setting
The USGS Hutchins 7.5â Quadrangle map illustrated the APE as located within the Trinity River
floodplain and the adjacent lowland terraces. The APE is predominately located within a topographic
setting modified by landfill use and strip mines located on the elevated terraces.
2.1.3 - Geology and Soils
The APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion and the Floodplains and Low
Terraces ecoregion of the Texas Blackland Prairies. The Blackland Prairies region is characterized by
low-relief topography containing âdark, thick, plastic clay soilsâ known as Vertisols (Griffith et al. 2007,
Hill 1901). Historically, the Northern Blackland Prairies contained large expanses of tall prairie grasses,
but agriculture, ranching, and urban development has greatly modified this ecoregion (Griffith et al.
2007). The Floodplains and Low Terraces ecoregion covers Holocene deposits in only the broadest
floodplains such as those of the Trinity River.
Soils within the APE consist of Quaternary alluvium and terrace deposits dating to the Holocene and
Pleistocene (McGowen et al. 1972). These deposits are composed of sand, silt, clay, and gravel (USGS
2016). Alluvium deposits are found in floodplains and terrace deposits are adjacent to and outside of the
immediate channels of the Trinity River and its tributaries (Figure 2.1) (Scoggins 2004).
Five soil series were identified within the APE (Figure 2.2). Table 2.1 provides a brief description of the
five soils and their percentages within the APE. According to the Soil Survey of Dallas County, Texas
(Coffee 1980) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS) web soil survey data for Dallas County (Web Soil Survey 2016), the soils are generally
characterized as well drained loamy soils.

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) maintained by the THC identified four
previously conducted archeological surveys overlapped the APE (Figure 3.1) (TASA 2016). The most
recent survey crossed by the APE was a survey conducted in 2010 by URS for the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department (TPWD) and the City of Dallas as part of the Trinity Forest Trails Project. During
the pedestrian survey, no archeological sites were encountered within shovel testing and deep mechanical
testing efforts. The remaining three archeological surveys are summarized in Table 3.1. In addition,
TASA archives indicated that six archeological surveys have been conducted within one-mile (~1600
meters [m]) of the APE (Table 3.2).

3.2 Previous Recorded Sites within Vicinity
The TASA database identified that there is one previously recorded archeological site (41DL76) located
within the APE (Table 3.3). However, the prehistoric camp site originally recorded in 1940 was found to
have been destroyed by strip mining during a site revisit in 1976. There are no National Register
Properties, historical markers, or cemeteries located within the proposed APE (TASA 2016). According
to the TASA records, there are an additional 12 recorded sites within one-mile of the APE. These sites
are summarized in Table 3.4.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Dallas County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas, Dallas Sheet, the USGS topographic map, the NRCS
digital soil database for Dallas County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for the Dallas
District, the National Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District

Page 11

Maps for Dallas County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and both past and
current aerial photography.
3.3.1 - Prehistoric Resource Potential
According to the PALM for Dallas County, the majority of the APE has a high potential for shallow and
deeply buried cultural deposits, while the remaining portions of the APE feature a moderate potential
within a reasonable context. Only a minimal portion of the APE consisted of negligible potential for
encountering cultural resources.
However, through aerial photography and USGS topographic map interpretations, it was concluded that
the vast majority of the APE does not have a reasonable context as it has been exposed to significant
ground disturbing activities. These disturbances are predominantly related to large-scale sand and gravel
strip mining as well as landfill creation and use. The presence of highly disturbed ground was supported
by the presence of the Arents soil series, which is characterized as mixed alluvium formed by unnatural
methods of moving.
Other disturbances include vegetation clearing for agricultural fields or pastures and transportation
development. The disturbances associated with mining and landfill use would have destroyed any
potential archeological sites within these locations, including the previously recorded archeological site
41DL76. These disturbances are common within the Trinity River floodplain and are documented within
the records of several archeological sites upstream and downstream from the APE.
Although shallowly buried archeological sites have been documented within the APE and within the
greater Trinity River floodplain, a large percentage of these surficial sites were documented within areas
that had been heavily disturbed. These disturbances are noted within many of the archeological site forms
on record. As such, surficial cultural manifestations observed by the recorder would likely have been the
result of deeper subsurface deposits being brought to the surface by the large-scale disturbances discussed
above.
More commonly, archeological sites within the floodplain of the Trinity River are deeply buried below
the modern floodplain surface. Records from sites located within the Trinity River floodplain upstream
and downstream from the APE are primarily related to prehistoric activity. Prehistoric cultural deposits
have been documented as deep as three meters below surface with far fewer sites being documented less
than one meter from the modern surface.
3.3.2 - Historic-Period Resource Potential
Historical aerial photographs and maps illustrate there were no historic structures or significant features
located within the APE corridor. Historical aerial photographs dating back to 1945 depict that the
majority of land within the APE was initially used for agricultural or ranching activities. In the 1950s, the
central portion of the APE became the location for sand and gravel mining, which expanded further north
and west in subsequent decades until the 1990s.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for the Trinity Raw Water Transfer Line Project was conducted on 07
December 2016. The methods and density of backhoe trenching met the minimum requirements for field
tactics stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (CTA 1996, 2001).
Prior to field work, the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to determine
what cultural resources have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile radius of the APE (see
Chapter 3). Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, soils data, as well as, historical and
modern topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Pedestrian Survey
The 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of a careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. A transect survey was
implemented across the entire APE and consisted of a single transect. Areas displaying high levels of
disturbance were photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits. Other
documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.

4.2 Backhoe Trenching
Backhoe trenching was conducted within the floodplain of the Trinity River where the high potential for
deeply buried deposits capable of containing cultural resources was identified by URS in 2010, but were
unable to sample due to standing water. Backhoe trenching is generally required when there is elevated
potential for encountering soils capable of containing deeply buried archeological deposits (i.e., greater
than 1 m). Trenches averaged 5 m in length and up to 3 m in depth. Depending on soil stability, when
the trench was excavated to a depth of approximately 4 feet, an Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) competent crew member assessed the stability of the trench. As necessary, once
the stability of the trench was deemed safe, the crew collected data through soil screening, spoil pile hand
screening, stratigraphic soil properties, profile map, and photographs. A representative sample from each
stratigraphic layer was screened through Â¼-inch wire mesh. The remaining excavated soil was visually
assessed as it was placed on the spoil pile. If cultural material was identified within a backhoe trench, a
column sample was collected. The column sample was excavated in arbitrary 20 centimeters (cm) levels
to the base of the trench or sterile soil. If soil stability was low, the trench was widened through benching
and/or kept to a safe depth for recordation. After the trench had been recorded, the backhoe continued to
excavate deeper. During this stage, excavated dirt and trench walls were monitored for any sign of
cultural material. If cultural materials were observed, they were recorded and an approximate depth was
documented. Once the trench reached sterile soils, bedrock, or approaches the maximum depth the
backhoe can safely excavate, the trench was photographed, backfilled, and geospatially recorded using
Trimble Geo XT handheld GPS.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in feet or miles within this
report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in meters or centimeters, unless artifact
diagnostic elements must be presented within Imperial unit measurements.

4.3 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be
temporarily curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During the survey, two backhoe trenches were excavated within the 3.56-acre APE. A photograph
location map with general project photographs is located in Appendix A. Trench profile illustrations are
located in Appendix B.

5.1 Pedestrian Survey
The vast majority of the proposed APE parallels the Trinity Forest Trail, which is comprised of an
approximate 10-foot wide concrete trail. Only the northwestmost portion of the APE, located within the
newly constructed City of Dallas Golf Trinity Forest Golf Course, does not parallel the trail system.
Although the topography is not illustrated within USGS topographic maps, the proposed APE is located
at the base of several prominent manmade hills that were once a City of Dallas landfill. These landfills
were created within old gravel/strip mining quarries that extend within the APE.
As such, through the 100 percent pedestrian survey, it was determined that approximately 22.8 percent of
the APE was determined to have potential for cultural deposits. This area was located within the
southernmost extent of the APE within the forested riparian corridor along the Trinity River (Appendix
A, Photographs 10, 11, and 19). The remaining 77.2 percent of the APE was determined to be within a
completely modified setting that pertained to existing pipeline easements, gravel/strip mining, and landfill
use (Figure 5.1) (Appendix A, Photographs 23 through 30).

5.2 Backhoe Trenching
Based on the known archeological record along the Trinity River and the limited APE acreage that could
contain cultural deposits, it was determined that subsurface sampling would be comprised entirely of
backhoe trenching. To sufficiently assess for deeply buried archeological deposits two trenches were
excavated within the APE (Figure 5.2). Trenches were placed at opposite ends of the APE segment
designated for trenching to obtain the best possible subsurface coverage. The exact placement of trenches
was influenced by the narrow APE limits, the presence of old growth forest, and existing infrastructure.
No cultural resources were encountered during the excavation, monitoring, and recording of the two
backhoe trenches. The general characteristics of each trench are described below.
5.2.1 - Trench 1
5.2.1.1: Location and Description
Trench 1 was approximately 80 feet east of the Trinity River. Due to the presence of large old growth
trees, an existing water well, and a concrete trail path, the trench was placed paralleling the river. The
excavated trench was approximately 29 feet long and three feet wide (Appendix B, Photographs 13
through 15). The trench was located within a prominent point bar that was bounded by the Trinity River
to the west and south and an unnamed tributary to the east. As the trench was located within the natural
levee of the Trinity River, the topography was minimally sloped along the river banks and had a
pronounced trough located northeast of the APE. No cultural deposits were identified within Trench 1.
5.2.1.2: Trench Profile
â¢

Zone I was characterized by a homogenous, brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam with abundant
fine roots to a depth of approximately 25 centimeters below surface (cmbs). This zone
featured a granular structure that was very weak. The lower boundary transition was clear
and smooth.

â¢

Zone II featured a very dark grey (10YR 3/1) sandy clay loam that contained brown (10YR
4/3) and dark grey (10YR 4/1) mottling that was common within the matrix to a depth of
approximately 45 cmbs. This zone contained a blocky structure that was very strong and
had rounded gravel (3 cm or less), course particulate sediment, and mussel shell that were
common. A single piece of chert shatter was observed within the zone, but was not
considered to be affiliated with prehistoric activity. The lower boundary transition was clear
and wavy.

â¢

Zone III was comprised of an abundant amount of organic flood debris that was intermixed
within a dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay loam matrix to a depth of approximately 60
cmbs. The matrix contained abundant reddish brown (5YR 4/4), red (5YR 4/6), and dark
brown (10YR 3/2) mottling. The zone featured a very strong, massive structure within
abundant fine root inclusions. Several pieces of plastic were observed within this zone. The
lower boundary transition was diffused.

â¢

Zone IV was characterized by a dark grey (10YR 4/1) clay loam that contained dark reddish
brown (5YR 3/3) mottling and an abundant amount of organic debris to a depth of
approximately 110 cmbs. This zone contained fine roots that were common and had a lower
boundary transition that was diffuse. The structure was very strong and blocky. Several
pieces of plastic were observed within this zone.

â¢

Zone V featured a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam with abundant very dark grey
(10YR 3/) mottling to a depth of approximately 140 cmbs. Few fine roots were observed
within a matrix that contained a friable granular structure. The lower boundary transition
was clear.

â¢

Zone VI was comprised of a dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) sandy clay loam with abundant
olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) mottling to a depth of approximately 300 cmbs. This homogenous
zone did not contain any inclusions and had a very friable granular structure.

â¢

Zone VII contained a dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam with brown (10YR 4/3) mottling that
was common and extended to a depth that exceeded 320 cmbs. This zone featured a very
strong, block matrix that was intermixed with course particulate sediment. Specimens of
both Rabdotus and Planorbidae (Ramshorn) snails and mussel shell fragments were observed
within this zone. The lower boundary was not encountered.

5.2.2 - Trench 2
5.2.2.1: Location and Description
Trench 2 was located approximately 440 feet north of Trench 1 and 157 feet east of the eastern cut bank
of the Trinity River. Due to the presence of large old growth trees, an existing water well, and a concrete
trail path, the trench was placed paralleling the river. The excavated trench was approximately 26 feet
long and three feet wide (Appendix B, Photographs 16-18). The trench was located within a prominent
point bar that was bounded by an unnamed tributary to the east and the Trinity River to the west and
south. As the trench was located within the natural levee of the Trinity River, the topography was
minimally sloped along the river banks and had a pronounced trough located east of the APE. No cultural
deposits were identified within Trench 2.
5.2.2.2: Trench Profile
â¢

Zone I was characterized by a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clayey loam to a depth of
approximately 50 cmbs. This zone contained a friable granular matrix that contained
abundant fine roots and angular gravel. Gravel appeared to be imported and may be related
to trail construction. The lower boundary transition was diffuse.

â¢

Zone II featured a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam that contained dusky red (5YR 3/2)
mottling that was common throughout the matrix to approximately 130 cmbs. The matrix
was homogenous and did not contain any notable inclusions. The zone had a very strong
and block structure and a diffuse lower boundary transition.

â¢

Zone III contained a brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam to a depth of approximately 180
cmbs. The zone had very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) mottling that was common. The
matrix was homogenous and did not contain any notable inclusions. The zone had a very
weak granular structure and a diffuse lower boundary transition.

â¢

Zone IV consisted of a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam that contained brown
(10YR 4/3) mottling to a depth of approximately 240 cmbs. A few Ramshorn snails were
observed within this zone. The zone featured a friable matrix that with granular structure
and a diffuse lower boundary transition.

â¢

Zone V was characterized by dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam that was mottled by
dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy inclusions to a
depth of approximately 300 cmbs. The zone contained a very strong and blocky structure
with a diffuse lower boundary transition.

â¢

Zone VI was comprised of a black (10YR 2/1) clay loam that contained abundant dark
grayish brown (10YR 4/2) mottling to a depth that exceeded 320 cmbs. This zone contained
abundant calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nodules that were less than 0.5 cm in diameter with
larger 1 to 2 cm concretions. This zone had a very strong massive structure. The lower
boundary was not encountered.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey, two backhoe trenches were excavated within the 3.56 acres (1.44 ha) direct
APE. Although background research indicated that portions of the APE contained a high potential for
containing deeply buried archeological sites, no cultural resources were encountered within the direct
APE.
Therefore, the City of Dallas has requested concurrence for the APE, and that no historic properties are
affected under 36 CFR 800.4 (d)(1). It is the recommendation of IES that the THC concur with these
findings and the City of Dallas Trinity River Raw Water Transfer Line Project be permitted to continue
without the need for further cultural resource investigations. However, if any cultural resources are
unearthed during construction, the operators should cease work immediately in that area, and the THC
should be notified prior to resuming any construction activities.
