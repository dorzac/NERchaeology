Abstract
In July of 2013, prior to the construction of a proposed 2,168-linear-foot wastewater line
in Georgetown, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey
and shovel testing (n=5) of 1,723 linear feet of the 100-foot-wide easement (4.0 acres)
where the wastewater line will be constructed mainly via open trench. The pedestrian
survey was conducted in accordance with Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and
Texas Historical Commission (THC) guidelines and in compliance with Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit Number 6602 as well Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. Ann M. Scott served as
Principal Investigator and Robin Benson Barnes served as Project Archeologist. Records
from this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL).
Evidence of previously recorded prehistoric site 41WM772 was found in the project
easement. However, the portion of the lithic procurement site within the easement does
not contribute to its eligibility for listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) or
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Beyond the observed
primarily surface manifestation of site 41WM772, no intact prehistoric or historic
deposits were discovered within the proposed wastewater line easement. Based on the
results of this survey, no further archeological work is recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The City of Georgetown is proposing to construct a wastewater line in order to provide
sewer service for a planned City of Georgetown Public Safety Training Facility in
Williamson County. The proposed pipeline would be an 8-inch-diameter gravity
wastewater line installed through an open trench, with the exception of the southern
portion that will be bored beneath residential properties, which would be a 470-linearÂ­
foot bore/encase or directional drill. This cultural resources survey evaluated a 1,723Â­
foot-long by 100-foot-wide pipeline alignment corridor (encompassing a 20-foot
permanent easement, 30-foot temporary construction easement, and additional width to
allow for modification in the alignment to avoid existing trees or environmentally
sensitive areas), which is the defined Area of Potential Effect (APE) (Figures 1 and 2).
The proposed alignment is located approximately 3.5 miles northwest of downtown
Georgetown, south of RM 2338 (Williams Drive) and east of D.B. Wood Road. The
alignment begins approximately 2,330 feet south of the intersection of Williams Drive
and D.B. Wood Road. A short spur runs from northeast to southwest for approximately 23
feet. Of these 23 feet, the northeastern 10 feet are on City of Georgetown property, while
the southwestern 13 feet are on US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) property. The
proposed route then continues to the southeast on USACE property for approximately
1,700 feet. These sections of the proposed wastewater line would be installed through an
open trench. At this point, the route would be bored, as it would travel under residential
property within the Turtle Bend Subdivision. The entire section within the subdivision
parcels continues for approximately 445 feet to join an existing wastewater line at the cul
de sac on Sabine Drive (Figure 3). The pipeline alignment in total is approximately
2,170 feet in length. The 1,723-foot-long portion of the alignment that would be
constructed via open trench was subject to a cultural resources survey while the 445-foot
portion of the line that would be bored was not subject to archeological survey.
This investigation consisted of an intensive archeological survey of the proposed
Georgetown wastewater line pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC
26.20[2]). The overall investigation included pedestrian survey, photography, subsurface
testing (shovel testing), site recording, basic archival research and National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and State Archeological Landmark (SAL) eligibility assessment,
data analysis, and report preparation in accordance with Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards. Because the proposed
wastewater line crosses federal lands owned by USACE, Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, also applies. However, because
no USACE jurisdictional waters are present within the proposed wastewater alignment,
Section 106 compliance for Section 404 of the Clean Water Act is not required.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

2.1
Environmental Setting
The project area is located in central Texas in the south end of the Lampasas Cut Plain.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is characterized by rolling hills bisected by the Brazos River and
its tributaries to form broad, shallow valleys. In this region, the hills provide
approximately 30 meters of relief along the creeks. Karst features including sinks, caves,
and rock shelters are present but not common (Collins and Mear 1998).
The Blackland Prairie lies just to the east of the project area on the eastern side of the
Balcones Escarpment, a fault zone with hills to the west and north and low relief to the
east and south. The Blackland Prairie supports prairie vegetation along with small woods
often found along low-gradient streams. The Edwards Plateau is located just to the west
of the project area. This region differs from the Lampasas Cut Plain in that the stream cut
valleys are more deeply incised. Springs, karstic sinks, caves, and rock shelters are
characteristic of the region.
Prehistoric and historic peoples living in the region would have had access to resources of
the Blackland Prairie and Edwards Plateau in addition to Lampasas Cut Plain resources.
The diversity of biotic resources found in this ecotonal region would have been high. In
addition, there is access to reliable water sources as well as chert for making stone tools.
2.2
Soils
Soils in this area are classified as Eckrant Association, an association composed of
shallow, stony, and clayey soils formed from indurated fractured limestone or limy earth
(SCS 1983). One soil unit occurs in the proposed alignment (Figure 4):
Eckrant extremely stony clay, 0 to 3 percent slopes. (EeB) â This soil occupies shallow
valleys and broad ridges on uplands, irregular in shape, ranging from 50 to 500 acres. The
surface layer is stony, very dark gray clay about 11 inches thick. Beneath it is indurated
limestone having fragments of limestone covering 25 percent of the surface. The soil is
moderately slowly permeable, the available water capacity is very low, and it is well
drained (SCS 1983).
2.3
Geology
The geology of the region typically includes the Georgetown Formation overlying the
Edwards Limestone Group that interfingers with the Comanche Peak Formation in
Williamson County. These rocks are underlain by the Walnut Formation, which has
members including the Keys Valley Marl Member, the Cedar Park Member, the Bee
Cave Member, and the Bull Creek Member. Below the Walnut Formation is the Glen
Rose Formation, another marine limestone that is a major groundwater source in the
region (Bureau of Economic Geology 1997).

The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from
the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological
record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
3.2 Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when Spanish explorers traveled through the
region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas. Captain Alonso De LeÃ³n
followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop several times during the 1680s,
and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and
Captain Domingo Ramon, a Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and
camped on the banks of Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them
Arroyo do las BendÃ­tas Ãnimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, the
Marques de Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through
present-day Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions. In the mideighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San Gabriel
River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753 drought and disease made
the missions uninhabitable, and Spanish influence in the area declined (Odintz 2002).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In 1835
continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and his company
of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the headwaters of Brushy
Creek in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson Fort, as it was called, was
abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several veterans
of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838 Dr. Thomas Kenney and his family
built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson County. Kenneyâs Fort
became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County. However, Indian attacks were
a frequent problem, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians. By
1846 the Indian threat had waned and settlement in the region increased. In 1848 the
Texas legislature established Williamson County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a
Milam County Judge and state senator.
By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half. During the
1850s and 1860s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the county.
5

Although urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat, the bulk of the county
remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived on subsistence farms in
log houses and raised corn. During the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave population
increased and the agricultural patterns within the county became more diverse. Wheat
and corn were the predominant crops in the Blackland prairies, and cattle and sheep
ranching was widespread throughout the county. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but
it was not a significant cash crop.
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War but picked up again in
the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton
farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisholm trail, which was established
in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives passed through or originated
in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s were also marked by the arrival of railroads
to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry in
importance. With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy
developed. As late as 1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by owners. By
1890 43 percent of the farms were worked by owners, and by 1930 only 29 percent of the
farms were worked by owners. The tenancy rates continued to drop during the Great
Depression (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of soil
depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil infestation.
The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation and encouraged
farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton production was reduced by nearly
half, while sorghum and wheat became important crops. Along with cattle and sheep,
poultry farming intensified (Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of
Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to the Hill Country
and vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant children could now attend
schools outside of their rural communities. For example, during the 1910s and 1920s,
Rock House School was one of the largest schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the
school boasted a population of 96 students and 2 teachers. The school was consolidated
with Liberty Hill School in 1947, and by the 1990s, Rock House had become a dispersed
agricultural community.
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the population of
Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the population of
Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown to over 85,700
(Odintz 2002). A pattern of absentee ownership and of non-agricultural use of the land

at times depending on lake levels. A number of the burned rock midden sites (41WM330,
41WM331, and 41WM334) were tested prior to construction of the reservoir.
A survey for the Williamson County Raw Water Pipeline (Schroeder et al. 1999) crosses
the APE. In addition, surveys for residential development (Godwin and Weaver 1996)
and the re-alignment of D.B. Wood Road (Miller and Howell 1996) were conducted in
the vicinity of the APE.

5.0 METHODOLOGY
Following a review of current archeological sites data and historical research, a 100%
pedestrian survey of the wastewater alignment APE was conducted to locate any
archeological or historical sites that may be adversely affected by construction of the
wastewater line.
Survey methods complied with THC/CTA survey standards for the overall project area.
A pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological or historical
sites that may be adversely affected by construction. The subject area was walked in
parallel transects spaced sufficiently to adequately cover the 100-foot-wide APE.
Recording methods included a daily log, photography, the use of task-specific forms for
recording shovel tests and photographs, the completion of a revisit site form, and the use
of a handheld GPS. No artifacts were collected.
Sub-surface testing was limited to shovel testing due to the shallow depth of deposits.
Shovel tests (n=5) were excavated in settings with potential for buried cultural horizons
or less than 30 percent ground surface visibility. The shovel tests were at least 30
centimeters (cm) in diameter and were excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits. The
shovel test levels were no thicker than 20 cm, and the excavated sediments were screened
through Â¼-inch hardware cloth or troweled through and sorted by hand depending upon
the clay and moisture content.
Evidence of one previously recorded prehistoric site, 41WM772, was encountered and
recorded. A revisit site form will be submitted to the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. The portion of the site within the APE was evaluated for inclusion on the
NRHP and eligibility for listing as a SAL.
6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
In summary, evidence of the previously recorded prehistoric site 41WM772 was
encountered within the APE. Five shovel tests (ST 1-5) were placed in areas with poor
surface visibility or potential for buried deposits within the 1,723-foot-long portion of the
corridor that would be open trenched. (Figure 6, Table 3). No shovel tests were dug in
the southern section of the APE that will be bored. Site 41WM772 was relocated within
the boundaries of the APE. The current condition of the site 41WM772 appears very
much as described in the original site form recorded in 1991. The site is a lithic
procurement area with concentrations primarily consisting of tested cobbles, crude cores,
and debitage. Some cultural material was found within the shallow sediments, but the
site is primarily surficial.

11

The north end of the alignment was not in the recorded boundaries of site 41WM772 and
no evidence of the site outside the originally recorded boundaries was observed. Ground
visibility was poor, and the understory shrubs and small junipers were dense. Two shovel
tests (ST1 and ST2) were excavated to 30 centimeters below surface (cmbs) (Figure 7).
Both were negative for cultural material. Older reddish sediments were exposed in both
shovel tests. Shovel test depths did not reach bedrock due to an agreement with USACE
not to dig deeper than 30 cm (12 inches). However, the shovel tests encompassed
Holocene deposition.

Figure 7. ST 1 near north end of APE north of site 41WM772.
Further south along the alignment, within the previously recorded boundaries of site
41WM772, bedrock was exposed on the surface along with tested cobbles and debitage.
As noted in the original site form, chert nodules and clusters of culturally modified chert
were exposed on the surface. Figure 8 is an example of a bifacially worked piece of chert
found to the south of ST 2. Three concentrations of lithics and an area containing chert
cobbles and seams were recorded using a handheld GPS unit. ST3 was excavated near
Concentrations 2 (Figures 9 and 10) and 3. Many chert cobbles and some tested cobbles
and debitage were found during screening. Bedrock was encountered at approximately
20 cmbs. The top 10 cm of clay loam contained most of the culturally modified chert.
Only one flake was found amongst the naturally occurring chert cobbles below 10 cmbs.

14

ST 4 was in an area with less deposition. Bedrock was hit at 13 cmbs. Sediments
included mostly naturally occurring chert but no artifacts.

16

Large cobbles of chert and chert seams were exposed between ST 4 and ST 5 (Figures 11
and 12). In this area, there was much exposed bedrock and sediments were thin and the
surface appeared reddish and deflated. Sediments became thicker toward the southern
end of the alignment (excluding private property further to the south). ST 5 was
excavated toward the southern end of the alignment just north of the section of the
alignment which would be bored. Bedrock was encountered at 25 cmbs. One flake was
found in the top 20 cm along with 18 unmodified chunks of chert. The more reddish
sediments were found above bedrock from 20-25cmbs.
Within the APE, site 41WM772 is located in an area where bedrock is exposed at the
surface. The bedrock consists of limestone with embedded seams of chert. Seams and
cobbles of eroding chert are exposed. The chert ranges in size from gravels to pieces up
to 30 cm in diameter. In the areas where artifacts were found on the surface, the lithics
consisted primarily of tested cobbles, cores, and debitage. A few utilized flakes and a
few pieces of bifacially worked chert were noted. No formal tools or diagnostics were
identified. This closely matches the original description of the site from the site form
submitted in 1991.

Figure 12. Close-up of exposed seams of chert.

While a portion of site 41WM772 was found within the APE, the cultural deposits were
primarily surficial and the buried deposits consist of shallow pockets of sediment unlikely
to reveal additional information regarding the nature of prehistoric activities at the site
under Criterion D of the NRHP. Therefore, the portion of site 41WM772 within the APE
does not contribute to the eligibility of site 41WM772 for listing as a SAL or inclusion on
the NRHP.
It must be noted that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural
features within a project area. Therefore, should previously unrecorded cultural resources,
including human remains, be discovered during the course of construction for this
project, the City of Georgetown will notify the Texas Historical Commission of the
inadvertent discoveries.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In advance of the construction of a proposed wastewater line in Georgetown, Texas,
archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey and shovel testing (n=5)
in accordance with CTA and THC guidelines along a 1,723-foot-long by 100-foot-wide
(4.0 acres) proposed wastewater line. This work was conducted in compliance with Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit Number 6602 and Section 106 of
the NHPA. Evidence was found that previously recorded site 41WM772 is located
within the project APE. However, the portion of the site within the APE does not
contribute to its eligibility for listing as a SAL or inclusion on the NRHP under Criterion
D. No other prehistoric or historic deposits were discovered within the APE. Based on
the results of this archeological survey, no further archeological work is recommended.
