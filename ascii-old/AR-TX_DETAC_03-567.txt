ABSTRACT
In July 2015 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resource management survey of the proposed Cross Roads Special Utility District’s US
Highway 259 water well in Rusk County, Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit #7433.
Proposed construction includes clearing and leveling a 0.4 hectare (1.0 acre) property to
drill a water well and associated pumping structures. The visual inspection of the area
found a dilapidated building which was used as a plant shop in the 1970’s or later. The
building appears to be made of modern materials and is surrounded with debris
associated with potting plants. A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated across the
property. No cultural material was found in the shovel tests. No artifacts were collected
or curated. No further investigations are recommended at this location. However, if any
artifacts, bones, or cultural materials are found or recovered during clearing or leveling
the area, then all construction should stop and DETAC contacted to evaluate the potential
impact to cultural resources important to the State of Texas. Based on the field work,
DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to NRHP
eligible properties for the proposed water well and pump station.

INTRODUCTION
In July 2015, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants) conducted a
cultural resources survey of the proposed water well for the Cross Roads Special Utility
District in Rusk County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed water well will be built east of
US Highway 259 and south of the Bighead Creek bridge. The survey was conducted at
the request of the Cross Roads Special Utility District in compliance with the Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act administered by the US Department of
Agriculture Rural Development (USDA-RD) and in compliance with the Texas
Antiquities Code. The report was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
under Texas Antiquities Permit #7433.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. The report was prepared following the short
report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a).

A

dilapidated building was found on the property. Based on the construction and content,
the building was a business to sell plants in the late twentieth century. The building does
not appear to be more than 50 years old; therefore, it was not recorded as an
archaeological site. No other cultural material was found during the survey, no artifacts
were curated. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no effect”
to NRHP eligible cultural resources or to State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) for the
proposed water well and pump station project.
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The projects area includes a 63.7 square meter (m) (209 foot (ft)) square property
totaling 0.4 hectares (ha) (1.0 acres (ac)). The corners of the property were staked by
land surveyors. Along with survey stakes and pins, the property is delineated by a
fenceline to the north and a tree line to the south. The western boundary is the US
Highway 259 corridor. The eastern boundary was marked with surveyor pins and stakes.
Vegetation was mostly mature pine trees with a moderate understory of various bushes
and shrubs. Ground cover was pine straw and leaf litter. Soils were described as
Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 25 centimeters (cm) (10 inches (in)) deep over clay (NRCS
2015).

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Rusk County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both
larger examinations and numerous small surveys. The closest large-scale investigations
were conducted primarily for the several strip mines under the Environmental Protection
Agency and Railroad Commission in Rusk and the surrounding counties (e.g., Sherman
2001). Small-scale surveys were conducted for several pipelines and road improvements
throughout the area as well (e.g., Drake 2000).
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The
documents of primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990)
discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407) describes
the Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area between the
Red River in the north, the Trinity River in the west and the Angelina River in the south
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic (Woodland) (ca. 200 B.C. A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the historic
Euro American settlement. The Paleo-Indian period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is
characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of
native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic (7000-200 B.C.) refers to huntergatherers who implemented more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting
their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also
referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing utilization of the
environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens, prolonged
occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, and the
emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of northeast
Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D. 8001600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990). Larger aggregates
of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and
cemeteries found in association with large mounds. A stratified social structure
developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975).

Extensive commercial networks were also established. The Historic period (1680present) describes both the history behind the current cultural setting of the area and
marks a transition from the native populations domination of the area, to the American
immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and counties.

Although the area was

populated by farmers and plantations, Kilgore was not founded until 1872 when a
railroad town was established on land sold to the International-Great Northern Railroad.
The town was prosperous until the Great Depression and the collapse of the Cotton
market. The population was less than 500 in 1929 but exploded to 12,000 by 1936.
Large oil companies purchased smaller operations and independent drillers by the
beginning of World War II effectively ending the boom. Today, the timber and oil
industries play a prominent role in the area’s commercial enterprises (Long 2010).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the survey standards
described by the Texas Historic Commission (2015) and report guidelines set forth by the
CTA (2005b). All fieldwork and reporting comply with the ethics standards of the Texas
Archaeological Society and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.

No State

Antiquities Landmarks will be affected by the proposed construction.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2015). The atlas contains an updated
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location
maps, and cultural resources records In addition, these records show State Archaeological
Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area. To locate
sites, the pedestrian survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination. Shovel
testing included excavating an area approximately 30 cm in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch)
levels down to the clay substrate or 80 cm (32 inches). The excavated matrix was
screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. Notes were made about soil
color, texture, and shovel test depth. Visual examination of the exposed subsurface was a

4

continuous effort between shovel tests. Surface inspection photographs and shovel test
locations were recorded with Ashtech GPS units with sub-meter post-processing
accuracy.
RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2015) revealed one documented archaeological survey and three archaeological sites
within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area. The survey was conducted for the Federal
Highway Administration along the Kilgore Bypass (Weir 1986). This survey revisited
41RK162, The Harris Cabin, and associated outbuildings from the 1840’s. Two other
archaeological sites, 41RK181 and 41RK182 were documented as prehistoric artifact
scatters along Bighead Creek between 200 and 600 m (650 and 1970 ft) of the project
area by Jack Hughes in 1940.
DETAC archaeologists conducted a visual examination of the property and shovel
tested the project area. The visual examination found the property was in a stand of
mature pine trees with a moderate understory of various bushes, shrubs, and vines.
Ground cover was leaf litter and pine straw. The topography has a gentle slope from the
northwest corner upward to the southeast corner. The slope increases between the central
portion of the property and the southeast corner. The central portion of the property was
cleared of vegetation and a test water well was drilled. A power line right-of-way passes
through the eastern portion of the project area from north to south and a dilapidated
building was found surrounded by debris in the north-central portion of the property
(Figure 2 and Figure 3).
The building is a single story, earth-fast frame structure, with a dirt floor and
vertical board walls. The roof was corrugated tin and plastic. The building has garage
doors on the east and west side with one large room between them. Windows were 9x9
or horizontal lights in aluminum frames along the north and west walls of the building.
Aluminum frame windows were not common place until the 1970’s (Staveteig 2008).
The interior of the room is littered with debris from potting plants (e.g., plastic and
earthen plant pots of various sizes, buckets, plastic pallets, fragments of wood boards,
etcetera. There is a second room south of the initial room with a continuous shelf around

chicken wire; no frames or glass were observe around the second room. Dry-pressed
Whitecastle Brick was observed around the base of the house along with other paving
stones. Other modern cultural features included the bed of a 1970’s pickup truck filled
with scrap metal in the powerline right-of-way and a water well roughly 80 cm (32 in) in
diameter line with modern dry-pressed brick near the northeast corner of the building.
A total of eight shovel tests were excavated across the property (Figure 3).
Shovel testing found 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in) of light brown, reddish brown, and grayish
brown sandy loam (Table 1). No cultural material was observed in the shovel testing or
during the surface inspection of exposed areas beyond modern debris.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed Cross Roads Special Utility District water well will include clearing
the one acre property, demolishing the building, removing the debris, and filling the old
water well before constructing the proposed water well and pump facility. The observed
building appears to be less than 50 years old. It is made of modern materials and debris
observed in the building suggest it was used as a place for selling potted plants. Texas
Antiquities Permit #7433 was obtained by DETAC for the cultural resources survey of
the proposed water well and pump facility.
Shovel testing found shallow soils with no prehistoric cultural material. No
previously recorded archaeological sites will be impacted and the surface inspection and
shovel testing did not reveal any evidence of past prehistoric or historic period
occupations. No artifacts were curated.
In conclusion, the investigations did not document any cultural resources. Based
on the investigations, there is little chance of encountering cultural resources in the
project areas. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect”
to NRHP eligible properties or State Archaeological Landmarks for the proposed water
well and pump facility.
