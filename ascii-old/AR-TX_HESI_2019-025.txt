Cultural Resources Investigations within Enterprise Products Operating LLC’s Proposed
SM 102 NGL Pipeline HDD Replacement Project in Brazoria County, Texas

ABSTRACT

On 8 March 2018, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted cultural
resources investigations along Enterprise Products Operating LLC’s (Enterprise) proposed SM
102 NGL Pipeline Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD) Replacement Project located in
northwestern Brazoria County, Texas (Project Area). Enterprise is proposing the HDD in order
to replace a section of existing pipeline that became exposed during Hurricane Harvey. The
portion of the Project Area on the northeastern side of the Brazos River is located on the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice’s (TDCJ) Ramsey Unit. As the TDCJ is considered to be a
political subdivision of the state, the portion of the Project Area on the TDCJ’s Ramsey Unit
would fall under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The portion of the
Project Area on the southwest side of the Brazos River is located on privately owned land.
However, because the Brazos River is a Section 10 waterway at the location of the proposed
HDD span, the undertaking will also require the use of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) and
Preconstruction Notification (PCN) with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Therefore,
the entire undertaking also falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. On behalf of Enterprise, Whitenton Group
(Whitenton) contracted with Horizon to conduct the cultural resources investigations within the
Project Area in compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the
investigations was to determine if any significant archeological deposits are located within the
Project Area and, if any exist, to determine if the project would have the potential to have any
adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or
sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit no. 8345.
Due to wet and boggy field conditions that were prevalent across the Project Area and
precluded the successful entry and use of a backhoe, the field crew was forced to scrap the
originally proposed trenching methodology and replace all field efforts with intensive surface
inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts.
The cultural resources survey resulted in documentation of no new archeological sites.
A concrete water trough was observed around a tree within the proposed HDD bore box on the
northeast side of the river; it may be associated with structures that once stood in the general
vicinity, as evidenced by a 1944 aerial image of the location. However, all structures have been

removed from the location and no other cultural materials were observed on the surface of the
Project Area or within any of the 25 excavated shovel tests. As such, in absence of any other
associated historic-era structures or deposits, the isolated water trough was not formally
documented as an archeological site.
Based on the results of the cultural resources investigations, it is Horizon’s opinion that
Enterprise’s proposed SM 102 NGL Pipeline HDD Replacement Project would pose no adverse
effects to significant cultural resources that are eligible for formal designation as SALs or that
are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that
the undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and
Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all
work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), TDCJ, and USACE should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of cultural resources investigations conducted along
Enterprise Products Operating LLC’s (Enterprise) proposed SM 102 NGL Pipeline Horizontal
Directional Drill (HDD) Replacement Project located in northwestern Brazoria County, Texas
(Project Area; Figures 1-1 through 1-3). Enterprise is proposing the HDD in order to replace a
section of existing pipeline that became exposed during Hurricane Harvey. The portion of the
Project Area on the northeastern side of the Brazos River is located on the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice’s (TDCJ) Ramsey Unit. As the TDCJ is considered to be a political subdivision
of the state, the portion of the Project Area on the TDCJ’s Ramsey Unit would fall under the
regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The portion of the Project Area on the
southwestern side of the Brazos River is located on privately owned land. However, because
the Brazos River is a Section 10 waterway at the location of the proposed HDD span, the
undertaking will also require the use of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) and Preconstruction
Notification (PCN) with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Therefore, the entire
undertaking also falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. On behalf of Enterprise, Whitenton Group (Whitenton)
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct the cultural resources
investigations within the Project Area in compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA.
The purpose of the investigations was to determine if any significant archeological deposits are
located within the Project Area and, if any exist, to determine if the project would have the
potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs) or sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit no. 8345.
The undertaking consists of: 1) an approximately 0.7-mile (1.1-kilometer [km]) section of
pipeline installed via HDD within an approximately 50.0-foot-wide right-of-way (ROW) corridor;
2) an HDD bore entry box measuring approximately 200.0 by 200.0 feet (61.0 by 61.0 meters
[m]) located southwest of the Brazos River on private property; and 3) an HDD bore exit box
measuring approximately 200.0 by 200.0 feet (61.0 by 61.0 m) located northeast of the Brazos
River on TDCJ property. The newly proposed ROW totals approximately 4.2 acres, while each
HDD bore entry/exit location totals approximately 0.9 acres. In all, the Project Area totals
approximately 6.0 acres.

Cultural Resources Investigations within Enterprise Products Operating LLC’s Proposed
SM 102 NGL Pipeline HDD Replacement Project in Brazoria County, Texas

The cultural resources investigations consisted of archival research, shovel testing
efforts along of the length of the newly proposed ROW segment, backhoe trenching efforts
within the proposed HDD bore entry/exit boxes, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Russell K. Brownlow (Horizon’s Cultural Resources Director) served as the project’s
Principal Investigator. Charles Bludau and Jared Wiersema (Horizon staff archeologists)
conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the assessment of the Project Area on 8 March 2018. Because the
HDD bore entry/exit locations are situated within alluvial floodplain settings, the investigations
were originally proposed to consist of mechanically excavated backhoe trenches within each
HDD bore box supplemented by shovel testing efforts. However, wet and boggy field conditions
were prevalent across the Project Area, and any attempt to enter the Project Area with the
backhoe would have resulted in a stuck and stranded machine miles away from aid. As a
result, the field crew was forced to scrap the use of the backhoe, replacing all field efforts within
the proposed HDD bore boxes and new ROW with intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing efforts.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 3 subsurface tests per acre for projects measuring between 0 and 3.0 acres in size.
This equates to a minimum of 3 shovel tests within each of the proposed HDD bore boxes. The
TSMASS also require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to
100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. This equates to a minimum of 11 shovel tests along the 0.7-mile
(1.1 km) HDD span. In all, a minimum of 17 shovel tests were necessary within the Project
Area to meet the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 25 shovel
tests within the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey resulted in documentation of no new archeological sites.
A concrete water trough was observed around a tree within the proposed HDD bore box on the
northeast side of the river; it may be associated with structures that once stood in the general
vicinity that are evidenced by a 1944 aerial image of the location. However, all structures have
been removed from the location and no other cultural materials were observed on the surface of
the Project Area or within any of the 25 excavated shovel tests. As such, in absence of any
other associated historic-era structures or deposits, the isolated water trough was not formally
documented as an archeological site.
Based on the results of the cultural resources investigations, it is Horizon’s opinion that
Enterprise’s proposed SM 102 NGL Pipeline HDD Replacement Project would pose no adverse
effects to significant cultural resources that are eligible for formal designation as SALs or that
are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that
the undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and
Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area is located along an existing pipeline ROW span across the Brazos
River in northwestern Brazoria County, approximately 11.5 miles (18.5 km) northwest of
Angleton, Texas (see Figure 1-1). It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) Otey,
Texas, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1-2). The portion of the Project Area on
the southwestern side of the Brazos River is located on private property, while the portion of on
the northeastern side of the Brazos River is located on the TDCJ’s Ramsey Unit.
The undertaking consists of: 1) an approximately 0.7-mile (1.1-km) section of pipeline
that will be installed via a HDD within an approximately 50.0-foot-wide ROW corridor; 2) an HDD
bore entry box measuring approximately 200.0 by 200.0 feet (61.0 by 61.0 m) located southwest
of the Brazos River on private property; and 3) an HDD bore exit box measuring approximately
200.0 by 200.0 feet (61.0 by 61.0 m) located northeast of the Brazos River on TDCJ property.
The newly proposed ROW totals approximately 4.2 acres, while each HDD bore entry/exit
location totals approximately 0.9 acres. In all, the Project Area totals approximately 6.0 acres.
Photographs of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resources assessment are presented
in Figures 2-1 through 2-6.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is situated on generally flat terraces on opposing sides of the Brazos
River. The southwestern portion extends across a slight rise to the west of a large bend in the
river, while the northeastern portion is on a flat and featureless terrace above the river.
Elevations within the southwestern Project Area range between approximately 40.0 and
50.0 feet (12.2 and 15.2 m) above mean sea level across the small rise, while elevations on the
northeastern side of the river channel are relatively constant at 45.0 feet (13.7 m) above mean
sea level. Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Brazos River Basin. Both sides
of the Project Area flow directly into the Brazos River via overland sheet flow.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.

The modern climate in the region is typically dry to sub-humid with long, hot summers
and short, mild winters. The climate is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from
the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses
predominate throughout spring, summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in
winter and provide a continental climate characterized by considerable variations in
temperature.
In winter, the average temperature is 52 degrees Fahrenheit (°F); however, during winter
the temperature tends to fluctuate greatly as air masses move in and out of the area. These air
masses can produce light rain and drizzle, and conditions can become cloudy. Spring is
relatively dry, with some thunderstorms and cool spells. Summer temperatures are high, with
the daily maximum temperature often reaching or exceeding 90°F. Fall is warm, dry, and
pleasant, with increasing cold spells.
The average precipitation within the region is 33.0 inches (83.8 centimeters [cm]). The
majority of this precipitation occurs as rain that falls between April and September. The growing
season is approximately 265 days long (NRCS 1981).

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

Brazoria County is situated near the southeastern edge of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansas, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texas province. McMahan et al.
(1984) further define 4 broad communities that characterize the portion of the Texan biotic
province that lies on the Gulf Coastal Plain: (1) coastal marsh/barrier island, (2) coastal prairie,
(3) coastal gallery forest, and (4) pine-hardwood forest (cf. Abbott 2001:24-26).
The coastal marsh/barrier island category includes well drained, sandy, coastal
environments and saline and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone (Abbott 2001:24). Marsh
vegetation is typical of areas that are seasonally wet and have substrates composed primarily of
sands and silts, clays, or organic decomposition products. Vegetation assemblages are
strongly controlled by texture, salinity, frequency and duration of inundation, and depth of the
seasonal water table. Sandy, relatively well drained, freshwater environments are typically
dominated by little bluestem, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, and brownseed paspalum. Wetter
environments are often dominated by marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, sagittaria,
bulrushes, smooth cordgrass, seashore paspalum, seashore dropseed, olney bulrush,
saltmarsh bulrush, saltmarsh aster, longtom, sprangletop, burhead, arrowhead, coastal
waterhyssop, needlegrass rush, and other sedges and rushes. Slightly higher, better-drained
environments are characterized by taxa like seashore saltgrass, seashore paspalum, gulfdune
paspalum, shoregrass, gulf cordgrass, red lovegrass, bushy sea-oxey, and glasswort. A variety
of fauna are characteristic of the shore zone. Important larger taxa include raccoon, nutria,
alligators, turtles, swamp rabbit, and many birds, including ducks, geese, herons, and many
smaller species. Aquatic taxa, including a wealth of fish and shellfish adapted to brackish to
hypersaline conditions, are also important in the coastal zone.

11

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

The coastal prairie category consists primarily of grasses with minor amounts of forbs
and woody plants in areas that are not saturated on a seasonal basis (Abbott 2001:24-26). This
community is characteristic of upland areas and grades into the pine-hardwood forest to the
north and east and into the coastal marsh/barrier island to the south. A wide variety of grasses
are found in the prairie environments, but the principal taxa include big bluestem, little bluestem,
Indiangrass, eastern grama, switchgrass, brownseed paspalum, sideoats grama, silver
bluestem, buffalograss, threeawn, and Texas wintergrass. Common forbs include Maximilian
sunflower, Engelmann’s daisy, black samson, penstemon, dotted gayfeather, bundleflower,
yellow neptunia, snout bean, prairie clover, tick clover, wild bean, western indigo, paintbrush,
bluebonnet, ragweed, croton, milkweed, vetch, verbena, and winecup. Woody plants occurring
in the coastal prairie include mesquite, honey locust, huisache, eastern baccharis, sesbania, live
oak, elm, hackberry, bumelia, and coralberry. The frequency of trees increases dramatically as
the coastal prairie grades into the pine-hardwood forest, forming an open woodland
environment with common stands of hardwood trees and occasional pines. The coastal prairie
is home to a diverse fauna, including coyote, white-tailed deer, skunks, cottontail rabbit, many
small rodents, amphibians and reptiles, and a variety of permanent and migratory birds. Bison
and pronghorn were also present at various times in the past.
The coastal gallery forest consists of diverse, principally deciduous, trees and
associated understory in floodplains and streams that traverse the outer coastal plain (Abbott
2001:26). Important taxa include water oak, pecan, poplar, American elm, cedar elm,
sugarberry, ash, loblolly pine, water oak, post oak, cherrybark oak, mulberry, swamp chestnut
oak, willow oak, sweetgum, hawthorn, dogwood, hickory, bois d’arc, sassafras cypress, willow,
cottonwood, and sumac. Shrubs and vines such as mustang grape, greenbrier, yaupon,
coralberry, possumhaw, elderberry, honeysuckle, dewberry, and blackberry are common in the
understory, as are grasses such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and Indiangrass. The fauna of
the gallery forest include white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, turkey, a variety of small
mammals and rodents, turtles, snakes, and many birds. Black bear was also present at various
times in the past, and a number of fish and a few varieties of shellfish are present in the
streams.
The pine-hardwood forest is characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees,
including longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, post oak, red oak, white oak, blackjack oak,
willow oak, and live oak (Abbott 2001:26). Riparian environments often support larger
deciduous trees like pecan, cottonwood, hickory, beech, and American elm. Understory
vegetation varies from relatively open to quite dense, and consists of shrubs, vines, forbs, and
young trees. Common shrubs include acacia, yaupon, mayhaw, wild persimmon, myrtle,
greenbrier, Virginia creeper, blackberry, dewberry, trumpet vine, gourd, and poison ivy. A
variety of fauna is also present, including white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit,
mink, skunk, various small rodents, turtles, reptiles, and many different birds. Black bear was
also present at times in the past, and bison and pronghorn were occasionally present in the
transition zone to the coastal prairie environment.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project is located within the Southeast Texas archeological region. In broad terms,
much of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the
Southern Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995;
Story 1990). Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin
subregions of Southeast Texas. These 2 subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the
inland subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast
Texas comprises a zone about 16.0 miles (26 km) inland from the coast that covers the area
influenced by Gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable
ecological variability characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes,
wetlands, marine coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses
considerable ecological diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney
woods.
In discussions of the prehistory of Texas, Brazoria County is often treated as part of a
cultural transition zone. Following Patterson (1995), Southeast Texas is defined as a 21-county
area (including Brazoria County) that lies between the Colorado River on the west and the
Sabine River on the east, extending about 124.3 miles (200.0 km) inland from the coastline.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to
denote Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural
characteristics of Southeast Texas culture periods are often different than in neighboring
regions. For instance, the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and
Southeast Texas, and Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for
Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time
in Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit
evidence of reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be
associated with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of
subsistence-related activities. Inland sites tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired
clay balls (at some sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites
tend to consist of multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain few lithics, oyster shell
tools, large quantities of pottery (in later cultural components), and numerous bone tools.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1985; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988). Evidence from
Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans were present in Eastern North
America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al. 1990), while more recent
discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for human occupation in
South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer et al. 1997). Most
archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation during the
Pleistocene glacial period (but see Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is
represented by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5,000 B.C.) (Patterson 1995). This stage
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end
scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas
are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period.
There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8,000 B.C.), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian
period (8,000 to 5,000 B.C.), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e.,
Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5,000 B.C. TO A.D. 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signals the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5,000 B.C. to A.D. 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a
significant reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far
less pronounced in Southeast Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas,
however, this hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The
appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone
assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural

16

SM 102 NGL Pipeline HDD Replacement Project in Brazoria County, Texas

stage. Material culture showed greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in
the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5,000 to 3,000 B.C.) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Many of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3,000 to 1,500 B.C.) and
several new types appeared, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and
probably the Gary-Kent series.
The Late Archaic period (1,500 B.C. to A.D. 100) is
characterized by Gary, Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos
points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition
developed in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981;
Patterson 1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period,
but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as
boatstones and bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang
knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial
practices included the systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre,
and use of locally made grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most
burials are found in extended supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials
are also known. Burial direction is usually consistent within single sites, but varies from site to
site. Patterson et al. (1993) report that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary
tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (A.D. 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 B.C., in the Galveston Bay area
by about A.D. 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about A.D. 300, and in the
Conroe-Livingston inland area by about A.D. 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears
to have progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983) established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped were common, while grog-tempered ceramics did not occur in the Galveston Bay area
80.0 miles (128.7 km) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception
of a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
coast west of the Sabine Lake area.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods
(Aten 1984; Patterson 1995; Perttula et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series was the primary
utility ware throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gave way to
Baytown Plain for about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and
Historic periods before once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984).
A minor variety, Goose Creek Stamped, occurred only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983).
Three other minor pottery types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal
Plain variety Conway (Aten 1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The
Mandeville and Tchefuncte types are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging.
Mandeville has sandy paste (like Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little
sand. Given their technological similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different
clay sources rather than distinct pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery
that characterizes ceramic assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast
Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined
by the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appeared during the
Late Prehistoric period, but, as already discussed, ceramics appeared earlier in Southeast
Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e., spearthrower) and
spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though they continued to
be used in the inland subregion along with the bow and arrow through the Late Prehistoric
period (Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In
fact, Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in Southeast Texas
as early as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points that consisted of
marginally retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a generalized date of
adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca. A.D. 600) in Central
and Southeast Texas. In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with
a small prismatic blade technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz,
and Scallorn. A serial sequence for these point types has not been established in Southeast
Texas, though Scallorn points appear to predate Perdiz points throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (crushed sherd) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek
pottery remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt
Coated pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue.
Aten (1983) has
reconstructed the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century,
including the Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (Karankawa), and Tonkawa. The presence of the
Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the
17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have
occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the
corresponding mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east
of the San Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe
may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying Historic
Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and
Cuney points after A.D. 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified
by the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1700 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Alonso Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar
Núñez Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast
near Galveston Bay. However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life
until after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and
mission system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the
native culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site,
where the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time that heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the
indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished. The Alabama-Coushatta Indians who
currently reside in Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late
18th to early 19th centuries (Newcomb 1961).
Though the alluvial bottomlands of the county’s rivers attracted settlement by AngloAmericans as early as 1820, the passengers of the schooner Lively who landed at the mouth of
the Brazos River in December 1821 passed on to Richmond.1 The area was first populated
when Stephen F. Austin selected it for his proposed settlement, and 89 of Austin’s Old Three
Hundred had grants in what is now Brazoria County by 1824. The earliest communities were

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Velasco (at the site of present Surfside), East Columbia (originally known as Bell’s Landing or
Marion), Columbia (later West Columbia), and Brazoria. Quintana and Liverpool were also
settled before 1832.
Brazoria County became part of the Victoria district when Austin’s original San Felipe
district was divided in 2 in 1826. In 1832, the legislature of Coahuila separated Brazoria
Municipality from San Felipe and made Brazoria its capital. Brazoria Municipality was the scene
of the Battle of Velasco on 26 June 1832, and witnessed other agitation against Mexican rule.
In 1833, county residents suffered both flood and cholera, but in 1834, population in the
municipality reached 2,100, and prosperity returned. A decision was made to change the name
of the municipality from Brazoria to Columbia, to make Columbia the seat of government, and
transfer some territory to Matagorda Municipality. At the time, the largest settlements in the
future county were Brazoria, with 500 residents; Velasco, with 100; and Bolivar, with 50. As
early as the mid-1830s, cotton farms produced more than 5,000 bales annually, and plantation
owners in the area became some of the wealthiest in Texas. On 1 March 1835, a meeting near
Brazoria led to the establishment of the first Masonic lodge in Texas—Holland Lodge No. 36.
When Stephen F. Austin declared against Santa Anna at another meeting in Brazoria on
8 September 1835, Texans began to prepare for a revolution. Agitation for independence led to
the formation of committees of public safety and public meetings to discuss the impending
break. After the convention at San Felipe and engagements at Gonzales, Goliad, and Bexar,
volunteer companies were organized and a provisional government approved on 13 November
1835. Henry Smith of Brazoria County served as the first provisional governor. Formation of a
permanent council soon thereafter brought the inauguration of mail routes throughout the area.
Rebellion grew in 1835 and 1836, culminating in the Texas Declaration of Independence.
Citizens of the county contributed men and means to the Texas Revolution and
participated in the Runaway Scrape. After his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto on 21 April
1836, Santa Anna and members of his army were taken to Velasco, then the location of the
provisional government. Here Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco with the Republic of
Texas on 14 May 1836. Columbia, the seat of the interim government, served as the capital of
the republic when sessions of the first Texas Congress met in October 1836. During the first
session, Stephen F. Austin died and was buried at Peach Point. Houston became the capital.
Under the provisional government, Texas accepted the constitution that made its first
counties from former municipalities. Brazoria County, among the first, took its name from the
Brazos River when the Congress of the republic established it on 24 March 1836. Brazoria,
which became county seat when the county was organized on 20 December 1836, served until
1896, when Angleton replaced it. The establishment of Fort Bend County in 1837 and of
Galveston County in 1838 drew the present county boundaries, and the towns of Columbia,
Velasco, and Brazoria were incorporated by the Congress of the Republic in 1837.
According to some sources, the last shipment of African Americans brought as slaves
into North America arrived at the mouth of the San Bernard River in 1840. At the time, the
community of Brazoria had an estimated population of 800 and Columbia of 300;
80 slaveholders in the county owned a total of 1,316 slaves. Yellow fever and flooding in 1843

and 1844 slowed growth, but the annexation of Texas to the United States in 1845 and the
Mexican War had little effect on residents of Brazoria County, who were mostly farmers. By
1847, Brazoria County had 1,623 white inhabitants and 3,013 slaves. In 1852, the county
produced 7,329 hogsheads of sugar, the most of all Texas counties.
During pioneer days, the Brazos River was the chief artery by which immigration,
communication, and commerce penetrated Texas from the Gulf. Small boats regularly
navigated as far as East Columbia, and customhouses were located at Brazoria and Velasco.
By 1840, Buffalo Bayou and the growing town of Houston had begun to draw commerce away
from the Brazos, but freight and passenger service between Brazoria, other Brazos River ports,
and Galveston was established by 1842, and a canal from the Brazos mouth to West Galveston
Bay was completed by 1857.
Between 1849 and 1859, plantation life in Brazoria County flourished, and the county
became the wealthiest in Texas, with a typically Southern society based on slavery. Agriculture
was the foundation of the county’s early economy, and some of the state’s largest and most
prosperous sugar and cotton plantations grew up along the rivers and deeper creeks on which
crops could be shipped by barges. Plantations in the county between 1850 and 1860 numbered
46, including 19 sugar, 16 cotton, and 3 that produced both sugar and cotton. Before the war,
these plantations produced an average of 7,000 to 8,000 hogsheads of sugar annually, and up
to 3/4 of the state’s output in 1857. Many planters raised cattle, and some cultivated oranges,
lemons, and other fruits. Twenty-six county residents owned more than $100,000 in property by
the year 1860; the foremost planter was John H. Herndon, whose real property was valued at
more than $1.6 million and personal property at more than $106,000. In that year, Brazoria
County had 2,027 white, 5,110 black slave, and 6 free black residents; by 1864, when slaves
numbered 5,125, their value was only slightly less than the county’s 283,151 acres of land.
Town life was subordinated to plantation life, and Old Velasco and Quintana served as Gulf
seaports and resort centers for antebellum plantation society. Later, the 2 towns declined in
importance as plans for an intracoastal canal to divert trade developed, and in 1875 and 1900
both were almost destroyed by hurricanes. Other transportation in the period was provided by
the Houston Tap and Brazoria Railroad, chartered in 1856 and built by planters to connect East
Columbia with Houston markets and with the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railroad at
Pierce Junction. After the Civil War, this railroad became the property of the International-Great
Northern.
Residents of Brazoria County cast more than 99% of their votes for secession, 527 for
and 2 against. During the Civil War, the Dance Brothers gun works manufactured weapons,
companies were organized for the Confederate Army, and women were left to run the
plantations. Fortifications built at Velasco and Quintana weathered Union attacks in 1862.
Confederate blockade runners operated along the coast, and some cotton was shipped
overland by mule and wagon to Mexico. Though the county suffered little physical damage in
the war, the presence of federal troops and loss of profit from cotton crops in 1864 brought
increasing hardship. Some plantations were destroyed, and agricultural production declined
sharply with the freeing of the slaves. David G. Mills alone lost 313 slaves as a result of
emancipation. County land was valued at more than $3 million in 1860, but its value had

HJN 180013 AR

21

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

declined to less than $2 million by 1866. During the same period, total property value in the
county fell from almost $7 million to less than $3 million. Many plantations were divided into
smaller farms or turned into pastures; others eventually became part of the Ramsey, Retrieve,
Clemens, and Darrington state prison farms. In 1870, only a single Brazoria County resident,
farmer William Bryan, had a prewar level of wealth, with real property valued at $100,000 and
personal property worth $20,000. As conditions worsened, some Brazoria County citizens
moved to Mexico, where they organized settlements in the Tuxpan River valley in Vera Cruz.
Between 1870 and 1880, the population in Brazoria County grew from 7,527 to 9,774,
largely due to the arrival of federal soldiers and other Northerners, foreign immigrants, and
Confederate soldiers from Texas and the Old South. S.A. Hackworth, bought land in Wharton,
Fort Bend, and Brazoria counties and sold it to blacks in the 1870s and 1880s. By the 1890s,
Columbia was the largest town in the county, followed by Brazoria, Velasco, Quintana, Sandy
Point, and Liverpool, and new towns had been founded—Alvin, Angleton, and Pearland. In
1898, at the end of the Spanish-American War, Adm. George Dewey acquired 65,000 acres of
land in Brazoria County.
Economic recovery came slowly in the Postbellum era. The principal crops were corn,
grains, sweet and Irish potatoes, fruits, wild grapes, and cotton and sugar for export. Sugar
production, reduced in the early years of Reconstruction, burgeoned with the use of convict
labor by 1871, but never again reached earlier levels. By 1867, the value of livestock, chiefly
cattle, nearly equaled that of agriculture. When cattlemen found northern markets shut off in the
late 1860s, hide and tallow factories were established along the Brazos River; Brazoria County
packed $100,000 worth of canned beef in 1870. Figs were introduced in the Alvin area around
the turn of the century and became an important crop. Four canneries were later built in the
community. Live oak moss was ginned at Angleton.
Though the Galveston and Brazos Navigation Company was chartered as early as 1850,
major improvements in transportation began only in the 1870s, starting with a canal across
Galveston Bay, completed with the help of the federal government. By 1905, workers
completed jetties to deepen the water in the harbors at Velasco and Quintana, and in part of
what became the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The Brazos River Harbor Association was
founded in 1925, and by 1929 Brazos River diversion reduced the problem of sanding in the
channel and opened the harbor at Freeport. Railroad transportation improved. The Houston
and Brazos Valley Railroad reached Velasco by 1907, the Sugar Land Railroad was serving
plantations along Oyster Creek by 1916, and the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway
established service to Brazoria by 1937. All were later acquired by the Missouri Pacific system,
and more recently by the Union Pacific. Major state highway construction in the county was
done in the 1920s and 1930s, though State Highway (SH) 288 was not completed until later.
The value of Brazoria County agriculture rose steadily after Reconstruction, and the
majority of residents earned their livelihood from the soil until the late 1930s. The use of mules
declined with widespread use of tractors after 1925, and the number of farms increased steadily
to a maximum of 3,065 in 1940. Houston Lighting and Power service reached the county in
1927; however, by 1930, the effects of the Great Depression were obvious. Whereas fewer
than 1/3 of county farmers were tenants in 1880, by 1930 tenants constituted a majority, a
22

SM 102 NGL Pipeline HDD Replacement Project in Brazoria County, Texas

condition that lasted until the 1950s. Between 1900 and 1930, Brazoria County was described
as a cattle-raising area, with some oil and sulfur production, dairying, and diverse farming. The
dairy industry, centered around Alvin, peaked between 1910 and 1930, and cotton culture in
1920. Corn culture concentrated near Sweeny, Brazoria, Damon, Danbury, and Angleton; stock
farming around Alvin’ truck farming in the Sweeny area; figs and poultry near Alvin and
Angleton; and pecans around Sweeny and East Columbia.
Rice culture enhanced the economy. Farmers near Danbury and elsewhere started
planting rice after 1900 and began to dig rice canals in 1935. From a total of 6,000 acres
planted in the crop in 1903, planting grew to 16,000 acres by 1940. In 1948, favorable growing
conditions made Brazoria County the nation’s number-one rice producing area, with a crop
valued at more than $10 million. The average yield per acre almost doubled between 1956 and
1970; an average of 53,000 acres was planted during those years. Rice and grain exports
comprised 65,000 tons in 1968; American Rice, Inc., at Brazosport, shipped 350,000 tons of rice
in 1990.
Brazoria County mineral development began at West Columbia oilfield as early as 1901.
Oil production started at Brazoria in 1902, reached 12,500,000 barrels in 1921, declined during
the depression, and then resumed. Brazoria County ranked fourth among Texas counties in
1946, with 29,308,106 barrels produced. Sulfur deposits at Bryan Mound, Hoskins Mound, and
Stratton Ridge Dome were first mined in 1912, and soon made the county first in US production
of sulfur. The Freeport Sulphur Company employed 800 persons at Bryan and Hoskins Mound
in 1930 and extracted 2,000 tons of sulfur daily. By 1944, the firm had extracted 552,000 long
tons of ore. The county’s contribution to World War I came from factories at Brazoria, Sweeny,
and Hasima that produced live oak nails for shipbuilding.
Brazoria County manufacturing was relatively unimportant as late as 1940, when it
employed only 166 persons. During the 1940s, however, the number of manufacturing jobs
increased rapidly. As the depletion of Bryan Mound sulfur deposits brought an end to the area’s
principal industry, Dow Chemical Company, drawn to natural resources at Freeport, came in
1939 and soon gave rise to the Brazosport industrial and port community. After the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, members of the Texas National Guard manned newly
established Dow facilities, while the company constructed 2,300 dwelling units in less than
2 months for its workers. By 1945, exports from Brazosport amounted to 117,610 tons.
Another effect of World War II on the county took the form of camps for prisoners of war, which
housed German soldiers and members of Rommel’s Afrika Corps for a time. A second phase of
industrialization began in the 1950s as “customer companies,” including Monsanto and
processors of chemical fertilizers, established operations nearby to make use of Dow products.
Industrial development attracted more workers, including people from East Texas and some
African Americans from nearby communities, while real estate developments produced such
new Brazosport communities as Lake Jackson. Transportation, meanwhile, included by 1949
the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway and the Missouri Pacific, which operated the Houston
and Brazos Valley; the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico; the International-Great Northern; and
the Texas and New Orleans. The county population grew from 27,069 in 1940 to 46,413 in
1950 and continued to expand. By 1982, at which time 17,800 persons were employed in 2,785

HJN 180013 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

business establishments in Brazoria County, 3 decades of further growth had more than tripled
the population to 185,244.
Small farms in Brazoria County increased through the 1930s and 1940s, and farmers
increasingly raised crops as tenants rather than landowners. By 1945, agribusiness had
appeared; fewer than 7% of all farms accounted for almost 70% of farm income, and more than
50% of farms made less than $1,000 annually. At the same time, the county ranked eighth in
Texas cattle production, with 69,437 head, and farmers turned to the Brahman breed. Overall
farm production peaked in the 1950s, with 130,000 acres of cropland harvested. County
farmers owned almost 82,000 cattle by 1960, and by 1968 cattle outnumbered people. Roughly
60% of the county’s agricultural income derived from rice in the 1970s, and 40% from livestock
and poultry; cotton, soybeans, and grain increased in importance by the latter part of the
decade. By 1976, the county had 48 oil and gas fields, including Old Ocean, Chocolate Bayou,
Damon Mound, Hastings, Bryan Mound, Danbury, Manvel, and West Columbia. In the late
20th century, petroleum and mineral production and marketing, together with other extraction
and manufacturing and the chemical industry, continued to shape the county’s development and
the lives of local farmers and ranchers. More than 2,549,000 barrels of oil and 44,831,552 cubic
feet of gas-well gas were produced in the county in 2004; by the end of that year, 1,270,790,962
barrels of oil had been taken from county lands since 1902. Magnesium from sea water, which
ranked Brazoria County first in the nation’s production, along with oyster shell, sulfur, and salt,
was manufactured at Freeport and Velasco. The shrimping industry grew at Freeport after
World War II. In 1967, 610 boats harvested 14,000,000 pounds of shrimp; the 1971 catch was
160 times larger than that in 1970, and the harvest doubled again by 1972. Both fishing and the
recreation industry, which grew up after 1960, fostered ongoing development on the Gulf Coast.
By the 1980s, the county had 186 manufacturing establishments that employed almost
18,000 workers. In the 1990s, when the county had more than 41,000 acres of rice in
production, the chief agricultural products were rice, cattle, cotton, corn, small grains, forage,
and truck crops, with some sorghum, soybeans, and horses. The Brazoria-Galveston Soil
Conservation District promoted adequate drainage to allow cultivation.
The population of Brazoria County became more homogeneous during the 20th century.
After 1900, the white population grew steadily. By 1920, as blacks began to leave for
employment in northern cities, the county had twice as many white as black residents. A typical
county resident at the turn of the century was born either in the lower South or within the state of
Texas. Native whites comprised 62.9% of the total population in 1930, and grew to 71.4% in
1940. Mexican Americans increased in the 1930s, especially around Alvin, where they were
employed as farm laborers. The county population, 23,114 in 1930, increased steadily but
predominantly in urban areas after 1940, and rose almost 57% between 1970 and 1980. Of a
total population of 182,244 in 1982, almost 68% were native Texans, 13,152 were African
American, and 22,679 Hispanic.
Brazoria County’s first school was established in 1827, Brazoria Academy in 1839, Alvin
Normal School in 1890, and the University of South Texas in 1897. By 1900, 8 independent
school districts with 200 teachers and 40 school buildings served the county’s 6,000 pupils.
Alvin Community College, founded in the late 1940s, enrolled 3,900 students in 1990.

Brazosport College began in 1968. Common-school districts expanded significantly around
1920 and suffered declining enrollments during the Great Depression, but grew again by 1940
as the northern county population increased with the rapid growth of Houston, and the southern
and central parts of the county grew through the influence of increasing industrialization. New
independent school districts became necessary. In 1935, the county had 27 schools for whites
and 28 for blacks, and in 1940 Pearland had the only first-class high school among the
common-school districts. In 1950, only 23% of the county population had completed high
school, but by 1982 more than 65% had done so. College graduates numbered almost 14%
that year.
In 2000, the census counted 241,767 people living in Brazoria County. About 66% were
Anglo, 23% were Hispanic, and 9% were African American. Almost 80% of residents age 25
and older had 4 years of high school, and more than 19% had college degrees. In the early
21st century, petroleum and chemical production, tourism, and agribusiness were the key
elements of the area’s economy. In 2002, the county had 2,455 farms and ranches covering
613,891 acres, 55% of which were devoted to pasture, 37% to crops, and 7% to woodlands. In
that year, local farmers and ranchers earned $47,422,000, with crop sales accounting for
$24,824,000 of that total. Cattle, hay, rice, beans, sorghum, nursery plants, corn, and cotton
were the chief agricultural products. Over 19,271,000 cubic feet of pinewood and over
3,680,000 cubic feet of hardwood were harvested in the county in 2003.
Angleton (2000 population: 18,130) is the county’s seat of government and Pearland
(37,640) its largest city. Brazosport (59,440) is a community of 9 cities, including Brazoria,
Clute, Freeport, Jones Creek, Lake Jackson, Oyster Creek, Quintana, Richwood, and Surfside
Beach. Other towns include West Columbia (4,255), Sweeny (3,624), Manvel (3,046),
Brookside Village (1,960), Danbury (1,611), Holiday Lakes (1,095), Bailey’s Prairie (694),
Damon (535), Danciger (357), and Bonney (384). Brazoria County offers water sports, fishing,
hunting, and other recreation, along with historic sites including Varner-Hogg Plantation State
Historical Park. The county celebrates a San Jacinto Festival at West Columbia and the Spring
Fling at Clute in April; a Mexican Fiesta at Pearland and Youth Rodeo and Frontier Days at
Alvin in May; a Fishing Fiesta at Freeport, a Fireworks Display at Alvin, and the Great Texas
Mosquito Festival and Parade at Clute in July; a Founders Day Celebration at Pearland in
September; and a County Fair and Rodeo at Angleton and the Bluegrass and Gospel Fall
Festival at Brazoria in October.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE REVIEW

Archival research conducted online via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within an approximately 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC 2018).
Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer
indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter
(NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources, including any listed on the NRHP or formally
designated as SALs, are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite
on the banks of the Brazos River. This site, 41BO137, is located approximately 3.3 miles north
of the Project Area.
Based on the Atlas database, the location of the currently proposed HDD span has not
been previously assessed for cultural resources. However, the Atlas does indicate that the river
channel just northwest of the Project Area was surveyed for cultural resources in 1985 for a
USACE-permitted undertaking. This prior survey produced negative results within the river
channel.

4.2

MAP AND AERIAL IMAGERY REVIEW

A review of available aerial imagery revealed the presence of a small structure within the
limits of the Project Area on the northeastern side of the river channel (Figure 4-1). This small
structure appears to be a small barn or house adjacent to a field road and north of what appear
to be several other structures outside of the Project Area. A review of subsequent years of
aerial imagery, beginning with 1951, revealed that all noted structures visible in the 1944 image
were removed by at least 1951.
Topographic quadrangles containing the location were available only for 1955, 1973,
1981, and 1984. No structures are present at or near the location of the Project Area on any of
these topographic quadrangles.

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area on
the banks of the Brazos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed
a moderate to high potential for prehistoric cultural deposits within the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures within the Project Area
on the topographic quadrangle map and modern aerial imagery indicated a low potential for
historic-era standing structures within the boundaries of the Project Area. However, the
presence of a small structure within the Project Area on a 1944 aerial image of the location
suggested a moderate to high potential for associated historic-era cultural deposits within the
boundaries of the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew conducted the cultural resources
investigations within the Project Area on 8 March 2018. Because the HDD bore entry/exit
locations are situated within alluvial floodplain settings, the investigations were originally
proposed to consist of mechanically excavated backhoe trenches within each HDD bore box
supplemented by shovel testing efforts. However, wet and boggy field conditions were
prevalent across the Project Area, and any attempt to enter the Project Area with the backhoe
would have resulted in a stuck and stranded machine miles away from aid. As a result, the
field crew was forced to scrap the use of the backhoe, replacing all field efforts within the
proposed HDD bore boxes and new ROW with intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing efforts.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 3 subsurface tests per acre for projects measuring
between 0 and 3.0 acres in size. This equates to a minimum of 3 shovel tests within each of the
proposed HDD bore boxes. The TSMASS also require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile
for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. This equates to a minimum of
11 shovel tests along the 0.7-mile (1.1 km) HDD span. In all, a minimum of 17 shovel tests
were necessary within the Project Area to meet the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS
by excavating a total of 25 shovel tests within the Project Area (Figures 5-1 and 5-2). All shovel
tests measured at least 11.8 inches (30.0 cm) in diameter. Excavated soil matrices were
screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense
clay soils prohibited successful screening. Following completion, each shovel test was
backfilled to pre-existing conditions.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, and
cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were completed for every
excavated shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on
any artifacts encountered. If any new archeological sites were recorded, standard site forms
were to be completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for
permanent housing. Similarly, if any previously recorded archeological sites were assessed,
updated site forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.

Chapter 5.0: Survey Methodology

A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo
log were completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld global positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test
locations have been presented in Figures 5-1 and 5-2, while the shovel test data are provided in
Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

SUMMARY

On 8 March 2018, Horizon conducted cultural resources investigations along
Enterprise’s proposed SM 102 NGL Pipeline HDD Replacement Project located in northwestern
Brazoria County, Texas. Enterprise is proposing the HDD in order to replace a section of
existing pipeline that became exposed during Hurricane Harvey. The portion of the Project Area
on the northeastern side of the Brazos River is located on the TDCJ’s Ramsey Unit. As the
TDCJ is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the portion of the Project Area on
the TDCJ’s Ramsey Unit would fall under the regulations of the ACT. The portion of the Project
Area on the southwestern side of the Brazos River is located on privately owned land.
However, because the Brazos River is a Section 10 waterway at the location of the proposed
HDD span, the undertaking will also require the use of an NWP and PCN with the USACE.
Therefore, the entire undertaking also falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA of
1966, as amended. On behalf of Enterprise, Whitenton contracted with Horizon to conduct the
cultural resources investigations within the Project Area in compliance with the ACT and Section
106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was to determine if any significant
archeological deposits are located within the Project Area and, if any exist, to determine if the
project would have the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible for formal
designation as SALs or sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. The
cultural resources investigations were conducted under TAC permit no. 8345.
Because the HDD bore entry/exit locations are situated within alluvial floodplain settings,
the investigations were originally proposed to consist of mechanically excavated backhoe
trenches within each HDD bore box supplemented by shovel testing efforts. However, wet and
boggy field conditions were prevalent across the Project Area, and any attempt to enter the
Project Area with the backhoe would have resulted in a stuck and stranded machine miles away
from aid. As a result, the field crew was forced to scrap the use of the backhoe, replacing all
field efforts within the proposed HDD bore boxes and new ROW with intensive surface
inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 3 subsurface tests per acre for projects measuring
between 0 and 3.0 acres in size. This equates to a minimum of 3 shovel tests within each of the
proposed HDD bore boxes. The TSMASS also require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile
for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. This equates to a minimum of

Chapter 6.0: Results and Recommendations

11 shovel tests along the 0.7-mile (1.1 km) HDD span. In all, a minimum of 17 shovel tests
were necessary within the Project Area to meet the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS
by excavating a total of 25 shovel tests within the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey resulted in documentation of no new archeological sites.
A concrete water trough was observed around a tree within proposed HDD bore box on the
northeastern side of the river; it may be associated with structures that once stood in the
general vicinity, as evidenced by a 1944 aerial image of the location (Figures 6-1 and 6-2; see
also Figure 4-1). However, all structures have been removed from the location and no other
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
25 excavated shovel tests. As such, in absence of any other associated historic-era structures
or deposits, the isolated water trough was not formally documented as an archeological site.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the cultural resources investigations, it is Horizon’s opinion that
Enterprise’s proposed SM 102 NGL Pipeline HDD Replacement Project would pose no adverse
effects to significant cultural resources that are eligible for formal designation as SALs or that
are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that
the undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and
Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all
work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC, TDCJ, and
USACE should be notified of the discovery.
