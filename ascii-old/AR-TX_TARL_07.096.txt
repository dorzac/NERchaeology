ABSTRACT
During the week of August 18, 1986, the Texas Archeological
Survey (TAS) , The University of Texas at Austin, conducted an
intensive pedestrian surface survey and I imited subsurface testing of
four areas within the proposed Goval Ie Diversion Project. This work
was carried out at the request of Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and
Douglas, Inc., agents for the City of Austin Water and Wastewater
Uti I ity, and authorized by Texas Antiquities Permit 571. The specific
investigative approach at each of the project areas was determined by
a combination of surface visibi lity, contemporary land use, results of
pedestrian survey and results of previous archeological research. No
cultural materials were observed within the actual project areas
although construction in Area 0 is immediately adjacent to sites
41TV455 and 41TV457. Vehicular traffic should be restricted to the
existing road and care taken to avoid these sites. The slight

INTRODUCTION
An archeological survey of four construction areas within the
Goval Ie
Diversion Project (Fig. 1) was conducted by the Texas
Archeological Survey} The University of Texas at Austin, for Parsons,
Brinckerhoff , Quade and Douglas} Inc.} agents for the City of Austin.
Antiquities permit 571 was issued to the sponsor by the Texas
Antiquities Committee. The goal of these investigations was twofold:
1) to determine the presence or absence of archeological resources in
the
proposed
project areas, and 2) to assess the effect of
construction activities associated with access shafts 1 lift stations}
diversion structures and sewer I ines on the cultural resources in} or
immediately adjacent to} the project areas.
The archeological investigations were divided into three stages.
Stage I consisted of a review of previous archeological work in the
vicinity of the construction areas. Stage II involved an intensive
pedestrian survey of the project areas. Stage III, contingent upon
the results of the first and second stages, was the excavation of
shovel probes to establish the presence or absence of subsurface
cultural resources.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Figure 1 shows that the four project areas were located on
terraces
of
the
Colorado River and Onion Creek.
Given the
preponderance of previous archeological investigations
in
this
environmental context (Brown 1981;
Davis 1984j
Thurmond 1982j
Whitsett and Fox 1979), much of the environmental reconstruction IS
based on the conclusions of these authors.
CI imate
The present cl imate of the Colorado River Basin adjacent to the
Onion creek Basin is warm, humid and subtropical. With hot summers
and mild winters, below freezing temperatures occur on less than 25
days per year.
Mean annual temperature is 68.3 degrees F. Diurnal
temperature variation is not significant in the summer, ranging from
70 to 95 degrees F, and from 40 to 60 de9rees F in the winter (Texas
Water Development Board 1976).
Mean annual precipitation is 32.8 inches but mean monthly
precipitation
is
bimodally
distributed
with peaks In spring
(April-June) and the late summer (September-October).
The driest
month is July (Texas Water Development Board 1976).
Flora and Fauna
The headwaters of Onion Creek I ie on the Edwards Plateau In
eastern Blanco County, near the southeastern edge of the Great Plains
physiographic province (Fenneman 1931).
The drainage basin
is
characterized by two major vegetational communities: the juniper-oak
Hi I I Country and the Oak Savannah (Garner 1973).
Once across the
Balcones Fault zone, the stream flows through the Rol I ing Prairies
physiographic region (Garner 1973:34),
a
moderately
dissected
grassland area with live oaks and cedar.
The easternmost physiographic region along Onion Creek, the
Blackland Prairie, is composed of grasslands and scattered mesquites
(Garner 1973:39). The vegetational communities associated with the
Onion Creek river terrace and bottomlands are elm-mesquite and
oak-blackjack with thick growth of scrub, cottonwood, sycamore,
wi I low, pecan, ash, and bois d'arc trees (Garner 1973:39). Many of
these species and vegetational communities reflect the impact of
modern land use (Davis 1984), with prehistoric upland vegetation being
predominately grasslands, dominated
by
Indiangrass
(Sorgastrum

Page 3
avenaceum), Canada wi Idrye (Elymus canadensis), and Texas wintergrass
Sti a leuchotricia), and bottomland woodlands composed of American
elm Ulmus americana), bald cypress Taxodium distichum) and pecan
(Carya i I I Inoenis) (McEachern and Ralph 1980, W Itsett and Fox 1979).
Associated with these now-extinct vegetational communities would
have been numerous faunal species that are not present today (such as
antelope Anti loca ra americanus)} beaver (Castor canadenis) and bison
Whitsett and Fox 1979). Numerous species of mammals,
(Bison bison
birds, repti les and fish have been or are native to the lower Onion
Creek Basin.
These include cottontai I rabbit (Sylvi lagus~,
jackrabbit (Lepus cal ifornicus), fox squirrel (Scirurus
niger),
opossum (Didelphis marsupial is) and raccoon (Procyon lotor), as wei I
as large carnivores such as coyote (C)nis latrans), wolf (Cfni)
~), mountain I ion (Felix concolor
and bobcat (Lynx ru us
(Whitsett and Fox 1979).

distinguished by matrix color and the composition of the gravel
mixtures they contain.
The Colorado River alluvial terraces have
red-brown to yel low-brown matrices (Garner 1973:30) and contain a
gravel mixture of I imestone, chert, quartzite, metamorphic and igneous
rock (Urbanec 1963). The Onion Creek sediments display hues of gray
and brown (Urbanec 1963:40) with gravels composed exclusively of
I imestone and chert. The difference in lithic composition of the
terrace gravels is directly related to the area drained by the streams
and is reflected in the color of the cherts eroded from the Edwards
Formation (Skolasky 1978:3-4). The large range of colors found in the
Colorado River alluvial cherts (Thurmond 1982:16)
reflect
the
variabi I ity of the drainage basin lithology.
The trend in soi I development in the area IS for soil depth to
increase as one moves down from the Edwards Plateau onto the Blackland
Prairie (Brown 1981:7). The shal low Inceptisols and Entisols of the
plateau are replaced by deep Mol I isols and Vertisols on the lower
portions of the drainage basin (Thurmond 1982).
The soi Is of the
Colorado River and Onion Creek terraces within the project area, the
Bergstrom, Frio and Lewisvi I Ie series, are Haplustol Is in
the
classification of the Soi I Conservation Service (Werchan, Lowther and
Ramsey 1974:116).

Current land use practices in the project areas varies from maize
cultivation and resultant plowing at Areas C and D to cleared,
unimproved pasture use (Area B) and vehicle traffic and parking, and
storage areas at Area A. Surface visibi lity ranged from excel lent on
the plowed fields (Areas C and D) to moderate on the pasture (Area B)
and poor on Area A.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The project area I ies within the Central Texas archeological
region (Prewitt 1981, 1985), a zone with a cultural occupation of at
least 10,000 years. The region has been divided into a sequence of
four stages identified on the basis of the major economic strategies
employed by the prehistoric populations: Paleoindian (12,000-ca. 8500
BP), Archaic (ca. 8500-1250 BP), Late Prehistoric (1250-200 BP) and
Historic (200 BP-present). The dominant economic strategies of the
prehistoric stages have been inferred largely from stone artifacts and
stylistic studies. In recent years, research has cast doubt on any
significant differences between the dominant hunting and gathering
economic strategies of the Archaic and Late Prehistoric stages.
For
this
reason,
Prewitt (1981) renamed the Late Prehistoric the
"Neoarchaic". Both terms are used here interchangeably.
Prewitt
(1981, 1985) further divided the prehistoric period into recognizable
cultural phases based on artifact styles, and site and artifact
assemblages.
The chronology was established with radiocarbon dating.

PALEOINDIAN STAGE (12,000 ca. 8500 BP)
The Paleoindian stage began with the arrival of North America's
first inhabitants, who spread rapidly to al I ice-free regions of the
continent.
These
people
practiced
non-specialized
gathering
strategies
and a degree of specialized hunting of Pleistocene
megafauna such as mammoth and mastodon.
Major time diagnostic
Paleoindian artifacts in Central and East Texas are stone tools,
notably Clovis, Folsom and Plainview projecti Ie point types.
Central
Texas Paleoindian sites have placed the region in the forefront of
Paleoindian research.
Publ ications are sti I I
awaited
on
the
Wi I son-Leonard Site (41WM235), which yielded the famous Leanderthal
Lady burial, and the stratified 41BX52 site near San Antonio.
ARCHAIC STAGE (8500 to 1250 BP)
The long Archaic stage is defined by hunting and gathering
economies.
Modern ethnographic studies suggest that these economies
yield greater proportions of gathered plant foods than meat, and they
usually require a nomadic lifestyle. Social differentiation is scant;
individuals accrue status according to their accomplishments and
neither inherit nor bequeath it.
The earliest Archaic phases in
Central Texas retain Paleoindian lithic traits -- basal edge grinding
and paral lei flaking on projecti Ie points -- but projecti Ie point
styles evolved into a variety of stemmed forms, notably the Gower,
Hoxie,
Wei Is,
Bel I
and
Martindale types.
The proportional
contribution of food gathering, evidenced by grinding stones and
freshwater mussel shel I, increased through the Early Archaic, and the
first burned rock middens were formed near the end of the period,
ca. 5000-4600 BP.
Population trends, inferred indirectly from the
ratios of phase components to phase duration, reflect increase to a
peak in the San Geronimo phase, then slight decline toward the end of
the period Â·(Prewitt 1981:75-78; 1985:216-225).
-rhe Middle Archaic
saw the apex of burned rock midden formation and the emphasis on the
plant foods baked in these features. Continued hunting is shown by
the Nolan, Travis, Pedernales and Bulverde projecti Ie point styles.
Population reached a peak early, then apparently declined only to rise
to a stable plateau late in the period. The Late Archaic, beginning
ca. 2250 BP, witnessed the decline and disappearance of the burned

artifacts to hunting artifacts remain high, however, indicating a
shift in emphasis to another set of gathered plant foods. Diagnostic
projecti Ie point styles are Marcos, Mantel I, Castrovil Ie, Frio and
Fairland.
Population rose steadi Iy throughout the period to the
prehistoric population maximum in the Driftwood phase, 1400 to 1250
BP.

LATE PREHISTORIC STAGE (1250 to 200 BP)
Technological
innovations

strategies
define
the Late
Prehistoric
stage.
Principally, these innovations were the adoption of the bow and arrow
and the use of pottery. The stage is indicated by diagnostic arrow
points of the Granbury, Scal lorn, Perdiz and Cliffton types, by
pottery and by cemeteries. Central Texas pottery is the varied and
il I-defined Leon Plain ware. This pottery and formalized cemeteries
both have affinities with East and Coastal Texas. Gulf coastal shel I
in Central Texas indicates continuing, probably trade, connections
with the coast.
The development of agricultural societies in the
Caddo area of northeast Texas had effects in northern Central Texas.
A single cob of domesticated maize in the Kyle Site (41HI1) (Jelks
1962) and occasional finds of Caddoan pottery in the same Brazos River
area indicate at least some exchange and social relations between the
two zones. Population declined sharply and steadily through the Late
Prehistoric;
the subsistence emphasis may have shifted to hunting.
Bison remains make a notable reappearance in sites of the Toyah phase
(650-200
BP).
It is in the Toyah phase sites that artifact
assemblages bear resemblances to those of historically identified
Indian tribes.
HISTORIC STAGE (200 BP to present)
Technically, the Historic Stage began In A.D. 1528 with Cabeza de
Vaca's transit of coastal and southern Texas, but actual record

that interval, indigenous groups suffered dislocations from the
advancing wavefronts of European diseases and other
dislocated
Indians.
The Tonkawas, recorded as in Central Texas in the early
nineteenth century, may actually have migrated from the southern
Plains. Intensive settlement of the Travis County region began in the
1820s with the founding of Stephen F. Austin's Little Colony. As the
history of Texas advanced, the aboriginal cultures retreated and
eventually vanished, so that now the native record I ies almost
entirely within the province of archeology.

METHODS AND TECHNIQUES
The primary purpose of the investigations was to record and
evaluate any cultural resources in the four project areas. The Stage

and 41TV457 (Whitsett and Fox 1979), in Area D. The current goal was
to ascertain the impact of construction activities on these sites.
At each of the four project areas, the initial method of
investigation was accomplished by an intensive pedestrian survey.

possible, a close inspection of rodent burrows was also conducted.
None of the areas provided road cuts for inspection of deeply buried
zones and the bank of the Colorado River at Area B was dangerously
precipitous, not al lowing inspection. Additional investigative steps
were deemed necessary based on the surface visibi lity and the results
of the survey.
The shovel probes excavated during Stage

were
45-50
centimeters In diameter and 100 centimeters deep, with the exception
of shovel test 3 at Area A and the single probe at Area D. Excavation

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
AREA A:

CANTERBURY

Located between Canterbury Street and the Hoi Iy Street Power
Plant (Fig. 1), the proposed project area has been heavi Iy affected by
the previous construction of a City of Austin sewage holding and
settl ing tank, pump house, and power plant. Visually assessable
disturbances consisted of soi I terracing, soil mounding, soil leveling
activities, and the deposition of a gravel fil lover the southern half
of the project area. Surface exposure in the northern half of the
area ranged between 40-100~, the southern half was grass covered,
inhibiting visibi lity.
Since the pedestrian survey located no cultural resources, three
shovel probes were excavated in the southern half to determine if
buried prehistoric materials were present and the effect of level ing
activities on soi I stratigraphy. The stratigraphy in shovel probes 1
and 2 consisted of a 1-2 centimeter root zone, fol lowed by 15-25
centimeters of limestone gravel fi I I, underlain by reddish-brown si Ity
clay. Both probes contained signs of disturbances to a depth of 45-50
centimeters in the form of modern window glass, round nails with
minimal rusting, concrete masonry fragments and a can, possibly
crushed by heavy machinery. No clear signs of disturbance were noted

containing fragments of plastic, aluminum, candy wrappings and blue

Considering the disturbed character of the deposits,
excavation was halted at 70 centimeters below surface.

by unimproved grasses and bul I nettle. Surface visibi lity varies from
30 to 100%, with a number of gopher burrows and ant mounds offering
some indication of shal low subsurface contents.
Fol lowing the pedestrian survey, which located no historic or
prehistoric artifacts, three shovel probes were excavated. With minor
variations, the stratigraphy of the three
pits
consisted
of
yellowish-brown si Ity loam alternating and/or interspersed with small
gravels. The upper 35 centimeters showed signs of root and rootlet
disturbance.
No plow zone was evident in the profi Ie. The zone
between 35 and 100 centimeters remained relatively compact with a
somewhat higher, fine sand content than the upper zone. No cultural
material were recovered in any of the three probes.
The potential for deeply buried archeological deposits
is
possible on terraces and floodplains of hydrologically active zones.
However, given the Early Holocene geomorphological data presented by
Baker and Penteado-Orel lana (1977:412), the presence of such buried
deposits is unlikely on this Colorado River terrace (Brown 1981:41).
Summary of Results:
1) No surface

Recommendations: Given the limited possibi I ity of deeply buried
terrace sites at such locations, the sponsor should be aware that
excavation may encounter cultural materials at depth.
The Texas
Antiquities Committee should be immediately notified.
AREA C:

FARM

Area C is located on the southeast corner of the intersection of
Highway 71 and Fal lwei I Road. It consists of a rectangle measuring
300 by 500 feet. As a result of recent plowing, surface visibi lity is
very good.
An intensive survey was judged adequate to assess the
presence of historic and prehistoric cultural resources in the area.
The survey revealed the presence of refuse concentrated in a 15
meter wide band along Highway 71 and Fal lwei I Road. The materials
consisted of beverage cans and bottles, other container fragments and
tire fragments.
In addition, 3 whiteware fragments, a threaded jar
rim fragment, 2 bottle neck fragments and 3 photos~thesized bottle
body
fragments were encountered.
The temporal range of these
artifacts is late 1800s to the 1930s.
These
artifacts
were
distributed
in
a
I inear pattern along Highway 71, extending
approximately 20 meters into the field. The finds suggest the former

presence of a structure at this location.
However, the survey
discovered no other indications of a structure. It is I ikely that the
repeated plowing of this field has destroyed any remains from a
possible structure.
Based on the meager surface indicators and their disturbed
character, no subsurface testing was warranted. This decision was
corroborated by Mark Denton, staff archeologist for the Texas
Antiquities Committee, who visited the location and examined the area.
Summary of Results: 1) Most of the cultural materials consisted of

potentially dating between 1890-1930. 3) No intact portion of the
historic component remains.
Recommendation:
Given the lack of intact
material, work should proceed as planned.
AREA D:

FIELD

This area, measuring 250 by 150 feet, is approximately 150 meters
south of Fallwel I Road and about 75 meters west of a fossil branch of
Onion Creek. Currently, the area is plowed and in use as a cornfield.
Previous archeological surveys in this portion of the Onion Creek
Basin by Whitsett and Fox (1979) located two sites, 41TV455 and
41TV457. 41TV455 is described as an occupation site of approximately
10,000 square meters with lithic debitage, burned rock and mussel
shel I fragments on the surface. The second site (41TV457), measuring
approximately 11,250 square meters, contains both a prehistoric and
historic component.
Artifacts are primari Iy whiteware fragments,
lithic debitage and shel Is. One Ensor dart point was recovered from
the surface. Whitsett and Fox (1979) recommended testing of the
prehistoric components of both sites and monitoring of the historic
component at 41TV457.
They evaluated both sites as potentially
el igible for the National Register of Historic Places.
The project area is located midway between 41TV455 and 41TV457 on
the southern side of a dirt road that crosses both sites. The
distance between the project area and 41TV455 is approximately 700
feet, and between it and 41TV457 is 575 feet. The existing dirt road
offers access to the project area without endangering the sites.
No
historic or prehistoric artifacts were found within or immediately
adjacent to the project area.

Page 12
The excavation of a shovel probe was attempted at 41TV457 to
determine the subsurface extent of the deposits. Three flakes and 1
mussel shel I fragment were encountered in the upper 20 centimeters of
plow zone. The excavation and screening of the next level, within the
hard si Ity clay, was extremely difficult and 1 tertiary flake was
recovered. The difficulties encountered indicated that shovel probing
was an inadequate strategy in this context.
Based on the limited
excavation, it appears that most of the cultural material is found
within the plow zone.
Summary of Results: 1) Two archeological sites in proximity to the
proposed construction area. 2) Pedestrian survey located no cultural
material within the actual proposed construction area.
Recommendations:
Provided there are no subsurface archeological
deposits,
and
vehicles
are restricted to the existing road,
construction should proceed as proposed.
If subsurface cultural
deposits are encountered, the Texas Antiquities Committee should be
notified immediately.
Summary of Recommendations
The intensive survey of four tracts to be affected by the Goval Ie
Diversion Project produced no evidence of significant prehistoric or
historic occupation within the impact areas. Two previously recorded
sites, 4ITV455 and 41TV457, are peripheral to Area D and should be
strictly avoided by construction activities and vehicle traffic.
