LATE PREHISTORIC CULTURAL PATTERNS ALONG
THE LOWER RIO GRANDE OF TEXAS*
THOMAS R. HESTER

ABSTRACT
Recenl research in the lower Rio Grande area of Texas has produced
new information on the late prehistoric peoples of that region. In this
paper, data are presented on the chronology, settlement system, subsistence regime, trade contacts, and technology of this period. Regional
variations of late prehistoric culture are examined and comparisons are
made with late prehistoric developments in the adjacent Chihuahuan
Desert.

INTRODUCTION
Adjacent to the Chihuahuan desert to the west is the area of
northeastern and southern Texas, which Blair (1950} has termed the
Tamaulipan biotic province (Figure 1). The Rio Grande is a drainage
common to both the Tamaulipan and Chihuahuan provinces, with the
upper and middle portions (ending about Del Rio) within the
Chihuahuan and the lower reaches of this river in the Tamaulipan
area. The bulk of the area within Blair’s Tamaulipan province is in
southern Texas, and it is this portion that I will review in this paper.
This region has had many labels attached to it, including "Southwest
Texas," "South Texas Plains," "West Gulf Coastal Plain," the
"Brush Country," and the !’Rio Grande Plain., Today, the environment of the area can be described as a semiarid and megathermal; with annual rainfall varying from 46 cm to 91 cm, decreasing
from east to west. The dominant vegetation pattern is a thorny brush
woodland, dominated by mesquite, acacia, prickly pear cactus, and
other bristly shrubs. Riparian forests of oak, elm, hackberry, ash,
pecan and cottonwood can be found along the major stream courses.
Before we examine the late prehistoric manifestations of this
region, it is first necessary to set these late occupations in an environmental perspective. Some ethnohistorians and archeologists
have made the mistake of assuming that present-day environmental
and vegetational conditions were also present in the prehistoric
period. On the contrary, there is substantial historic and archeological data that much of this region was a savannah grassland,
with the modern fauna supplemented by such species as bison, an-

telope and prairie dog. The widespread mesquite forests which choke
the area today are a comparatively recent phenomenon. The spread
of mesquite and associated thorny plants is probably the result of
several factors, including the commercial livestock industry (which
led to overgrazing and the increased dispersal of mesquite seeds),
short-term climatic changes, and the suppression of grassfires. The
latter factor is of particular interest, and several authorities have
speculated that the cessation of aboriginal burning of the grasslands
was perhaps the major factor in the spread of mesquite (Harris 1966:
408; Wells 1970: 213). Of course, we should not think that mesquite
was absent in the area, nor should we conjure up visions of broad expanses of grassy prairie. Given early Spanish accounts, it is apparent
that mesquite was present, in upland gravel areas and scattered
along the steam channels (Wynd 1944: 228). As Harris (1966: 416] has
written:
"the spread of mesquite should be seen not as an invasion of natural
primary grassland, but as part of the re-occupation by woody plants of

areas in which secondary grass communities had attained dominance as a
result of human interference."

Still, the vegetational pattern was a far cry from that of today.

PREHISTORIC CULTURAL PATTERNS

In addition to vegetational differences, it is certain that there was
more surface water available in the late prehistoric than in modern
times. Historic accounts confirm that the major drainages (and many
of their tributaries) were perennially-flowing streams as late as the
early decades of the 20th century. Overgrazing and the resultant
watershed destruction led to muddy runoffs which clogged the
springs feeding these creeks. Coupled with this was the lowering of
the water table through intensive deep-well irrigation for farming. All
of these human agencies have managed to turn the streams into dusty
channels, carrying water only after local rainstorms.
In brief, the late prehistoric environment was radically different
than that of today. The countryside was more open and water was
more abundant. We do not have enough evidence to say if these conditions extended back into the preceding Archaic (although I suspect
they did) or whether these optimum conditions were present for only
a few centuries during the late prehistoric.

LATE PREHISTORY IN THE CHIHUAHUAN DESERT
Prior to looking at the late prehistoric period along the lower Rio
Grande, I think it is appropriate to present a brief summary of late
prehistory in the Chihuahuan desert area. Much of the Chihuahuan
desert has seen little in the way of intensive archeological work, and
thus our information on the late prehistoric peoples is rather sketchy,
In the lower Pecos sector, the years of salvage archeology
associated with the Amistad reservoir produced a long cultural
sequence, primarily reflecting a long Archaic tradition. According to
the literature, arrow points appear late in this sequence, around
A.D. 1300; however, Gary Moore informs me (personal communication) that he has obtained several radiocarbon dates placing
the appearance of arrow points at ca. A. D. 800. These specimens,
largely of the Perdiz and similar contracting stem forms, but with occasional Toyah, Scallorn (corner notched) and triangular specimens,
are infrequent in occurrence. At two sites, Devil’s Mouth (Johnson
1964) and Javelina Bluff (McClurkan 1968), bone tempered plainware
was associated with arrow points. There are no data on late
prehistoric settlement or subsistence in the lower Pecos area.
However, climatic data presented by Story and Bryant (1966: 156) indicate that xeric conditions prevailed, with an increase in cedar, oak,
mesquite and agave.
In the Trans-Pecos, there is a diverse, and poorly known, situation
during the late prehistoric. There is the inadequately defined "Liver-

110

more Focus," whose traits include occupation of open campsites and
rockshelters, and the use of contracting stern arrow points, small end
scrapers, and beveled knives (Lehmer 1960: 125). However, the temporal and geographic extent of this cultural entity
or even whether
it truly exists -- remains undetermined. In the Big Bend area, late
prehistoric occupations are represented by several kinds of arrow
points including the Perdiz, Toyah, Livermore and other stemmed
forms. Campbell (1967: 11) notes that settlement patterns remain the
same as in earlier Archaic times.
To the west of Big Bend, there is something totally different than
found in the lower Pecos and adjacent areas. In the La Junta district,
at the confluence of the Rio Conchos and Rio Grande, archeological
studies have revealed the remains of a sedentary population with pit
houses, a variety of ceramics, and agriculture. This is the Bravo
Valley Aspect of Kelley, Campbell and Lehmer (1940). To the north, in
the E1 Paso district, the late prehistoric has a distinctly Southwestern
flavor, represented by largely the Jornada Branch of the Mogollon
(Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954).
In the western areas of the Chihuahuan desert, specifically in the
Coahuila district, late prehistoric materials have been recognized by
Taylor (1966) and Heartfield (1975). Taylor has defined the Jora Complex, beginning sometime after A.D. 1000, and distinguished by the
occurrence of Perdiz, Toyah, Garza, triangular and side-notched
arrow points. These projectile point forms are largely shared with the
Bravo Valley Aspect. The Garza type has also been found in the E1
Paso area (Lynn et al 1975) and onto the Texas High Plains (Runkles
1964). Accompanying the arrow points are a variety of plain and
decorated ceramics, which Taylor (1966: 83) and Heartfield (1975)
link to the E1 Paso wares of Jornada Branch. Other traits of the Jora
Complex include small end scrapers and various lithic and wooden
artifacts (Taylor 1966: 82). Midden circles, found in late prehistoric
contexts in the Trans-Pecos area. also occur in the Jora complex,
perhaps indicative of a food preparation technology widespread in
the Chihuahuan desert in late times.
In general, the eastern part of the Chihuahuan region (the lower
Pecos, Big Bend, and Southeastern Trans-Pecos) has evidence of a
late prehistoric population which changed little from the earlier Archaic patterns aside from the use of the bow and arrow and the
manufacture of a limited amount of bone tempered pottery. The
western part, in far westernTexas andnortheastern Mexico, saw the
introduction of Southwestern-type cultures in the E1 Paso and La Junta districts, and perhaps influence of some sort on into western

Coahuila reflected by the presence of a similar arrow point tradition
and diagnostic ceramics.

LATE PREHISTORY ALONG THE LOWER RIO GRANDE
A wealth of information has been obtained during the past five
years on the late prehistoric occupation in the southern Texas portion
of the Tamaulipan province. Most of the data are derived from excavations and surface investigations in the northwestern sector,
which is that area nearest the Chihuahuan desert. Before examining
these data, let us first quickly review the other late prehistoric
manifestations in the region. Research in the coastal strip of southern
Texas has led to the recognition of two archeological complexes
dating from late prehistoric times. One is the Brownsville complex of
the Rio Grande delta (Figure 2), with a material culture dominated by
artifacts of shell and a sophisticated shell-working technology. In
addition, the Brownsville complex appears to have had extensive
trade contacts extending down the northern Mexican coast and into
the desert areas of northeastern Mexico. A distinctive phenomenon
associated with the Brownsville complex was disposal of the dead in
special cemetery sites (Hester 1969). However, little is yet known
about the settlement and subsistence systems of this complex (Prewitt
1974}.
On the central and south-central Texas coast, we find the Rockport
complex {Figure 2). Occupation sites are usually confined to coastal
or bayshore margins. Cemetery sites, some apparently of Rockport
age, are also found. The cultural inventory includes stemmed arrow
points (mainly of the Perdiz type}, sandy-paste ceramics, often
decorated with asphaltum, and a core-blade industry. James E. Corbin (1974} has recently published a review of the Rockport complex;
Harry ]. Shafer and I have prepared, for publication later this year, a
study of the core-blade technology (Hester and Shafer 1975}.
The late prehistoric in the interior is less well known, except for the
northwestern sector discussed below. These are numerous late
prehistoric sites, characterized by the occurrence of arrow points
and associated lithics, and a widely-distributed bone-tempered plain
pottery (Hester and Hill 1971}. There are areas, such as the Falcon
Reservoir and Starr County district along the lower Rio Grande where
recognizable prehistoric components are extremely rare (cf. Nunley
and Hester 1975}.
I want to focus the rest of this discussion on the late prehistoric
evidence from the northwestern sector, primarily in Dimmit and

Chaparrosa Archaeological Project, directed by the author in northwestern Zavala County since 1970. This research has obtained information on all phases of the region’s prehistory, and the available
data have been summarized in numerous papers (Hester 1970; Hester
1974; Hester lg75a, Ig75b; Hill and Hester 1971).

horizontal extent of most of the sites has not yet been determined,
they approximate 3600 ms.

Distribution of late prehistoric settlements in the study area follow
a predictable pattern. They are concentrated in riparian microenvironments on the banks of large creeks or on the Nueces River and
its former channels. There is, occasionally, the re-use of older, Archaic sites but in general the late sites are horizontally separated.
Their proximity to more modern stream channels may reflect the
shifting of drainage patterns in late times. In some instances, Archaic
deposits are found to underlie the late p?ehistoric middens; other Archaic sites are found in mid-floodplain and on the bordering uplands.
When late prehistoric sites are not in the riparian zone, adjacent to
the stream channel, they are also found in the floodplain-riparian
ecotone, just back from the channel.
Intrasite patterning of the late sites remains poorly known.
Horizontal, open area excavations have been carried out at only one
site (41 ZV 83). Data from this site and other tested or surfacemapped sites indicate the presence of pits, sometimes filled with bone
or with ash and baked clay, of workshop areas usually related to
biface reduction, refuse clusters of snails and mussel shell, and
hearths. Hearths will sometimes be isolated without much surrounding debris, or there are occasional clusters of hearths and concentrated debris around them. At two sites, 41 ZV 155 and 41 ]W 8
(the latter outside the study area) there appear to have been areas in
the site used for disposal, as large concentrations of bison, deer, antelope, and other mammalian remains have been found in what may
be old erosional cuts in which trash [including potsherds, debitage,
and broken poinls) was thrown.
In my discussion of the material culture of the late prehistoric sites,
I will confine myself to data from excavated sites. The dominant
projectile point form is the stemmed Perdiz type. Corner notched, expanding stem arrow points similar to Scallorn and Edwards also occur, as do triangular points similar to the Fresno type. Also included
in the arrow point series is a thick, stubby form technologically
resembling miniature dart points. Stratigraphic evidence suggests
that these begin in the late Archaic and continue through the late
prehistoric.
It is difficult to discern any internal sequence within the arrow
point assemblage. There are at least two sites, elsewhere in south
Texas, Berclair (Hester and Parker 1970) and 41 JW 8, which yielded
only Perdiz points. Yet in the northwestern sector, data from exCavations suggest that the several arrow point styles co-existed in the
late prehistoric. This is in contrast with the Austin and Toyah phase
sequence defined for central Texas. Perhaps the most convincing

PREHISTORIC CULTURAL PATTERNS

115

evidence of contemporaneity comes from a refuse accumulation at
the Tortuga Flat site in Zavala County in which triangular points and
Scallorn co-occurred.
The lithic tool kit also includes end and side scrapers, often made
on blades. Four-edge beveled lozenge shaped knives, bifacial drills,
and perforators or gravers made on small flakes are known from excavated contexts.
Debitage analysis has been carried out for several later prehistoric
sites. Both percussion and pressure techniques are represented, and
in general, flakes are smaller than those produced in the earlier lithic
industries in the region. Flakes were used for the manufacture of
arrow points, scrapers, perforators, and casual cutting tools.
Sometimes, only minimal edge trimming was required to shape an
arrow point. A number of blades and exhausted polyhedral blade
cores have been found. Some blades were used for making Perdiz and
other arrow points, as well as some very small end scrapers~ the
larger blades were fashioned into end scrapers and other scraping
tools. This blade technology is widespread in the south Texas, central
Texas, and Texas coastal late prehistoric. Perhaps reflecting
available lithic resources, the size of the blades, and the tools made
on them, vary from region to region (Hester and Shafer 1975; Green
and Hester 1975).
Ground and polished implements are rare. No milling slabs are
reported from the late prehistoric and manos are infrequent. Hammerstones are, on the other hand, quite common, and are usually
made on small cobbles of purple quartzite. A deeply engraved tubular
sandstone pipe was found at one late site; at another, a rim fragment
of a micaceous schist vessel was excavated.
Bone-tempered plainware pottery is associated with the late
prehistoric sites and although it is not found at all sites, it has been
documented at 50-75 surface sites and in excavated contexts at
several others. Numbers of sherds per site vary from a half-dozen to
two or three thousand. The pottery has affinities with the Leon Plain
ware of central Texas. It is usually undecorated, though some vessels
are incised or red painted, formed by coiling, with hard and wellsmoothed exteriors and poorly finished interiors. Vessel shapes are
poorly known, although most seem to have been small, roundbottomed jars or bowls, with loop handle and lug attachments. Ollas
are known for a site in the northeastern sector of the region.
The pottery is tempered with finely-crushed bone fragments.
William R. Dickinson of Stanford University has described the results
of his petrographic examination of samples of the pottery:

116

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
"Sand-sized angular fragments of broken bone form about 20% of the fired
ware. The fire clay body contains scattered angular grains of quartz silt
and rare subangular to subrounded grains of quartz sand. From the setring, I suppose the body is an alluvial clay of some kind. Perhaps the bonetemper technique was a last resort in the absence of generally available
sandy deposits on alluvial floodplains" (Dickinson letter to T. R. Hester,
March 12,1973).

One of the most interesting aspects of research in the late
prehistory of the region is the faunal information that is beginning to
appear. In Table i, faunal data for 8 south Texas late prehistoric
sites are listed. Only 41 JW 8 lies outside the northwestern sector. At
least forty-one individual species are represented, and the information would indicate that little in the way of potential meat
resources was neglected. Large mammals, such as bison, pronghorn,
and whitetail deer are present, with the latter the most common.
However, in frequency of occurrence and in the number of individuals present per site, the small mammals (jackrabbit, cottontail
rabbit, packrat, and cotton rat) are apparently the major meat
resource. Fish, birds and reptiles also figured prominently in the late
prehistoric diet, with turtles the best represented in the present data.
Other food resources found at the late sites include large numbers of
land snails, which, based on ethnohistoric accounts, were gathered
as a food source, and the shells of freshwater mussel. The only direct
evidence of plant food is in the form of hackberry seeds and charred
fragments of acorns. However, we know from ethnohistoric accounts
that the gathering of plant foods was perhaps the most important activity in the regional subsistence regime.
Of particular significance in the faunal lists are the presence of
mammals which are no longer in the region, including bison, antelope
and prairie dog. Taken together, these species support the argument
for open, perhaps savannah, vegetational patterns in the late
prehistoric. Conspicious by their absence are the j avelina or peccary,
and the armadillo. Both are considered to be recent intruders into the
region, and the faunal data bear this out. Quail, a popular game bird
in the area today, is also absent. These birds are rather easy to trap
or snare, and their total absence in the faunal lists must indicate their
absence in the late prehistoric faunal assemblage. Since these birds
favor a brushy habitat, their absence may also reflect savannah conditions.
A review of the faunal tabulations reveals no recognizable
predilection for any particular microenvironment for the hunting (or
gathering) of animals. Bison and antelope were certainly more common in the uplands. Deer and many of the small mammals inhabited a

variety of closely-spaced microenvironments. The riparian microenvironment and the riparian-floodplain ecotone would have been the
habitat of many of the small mammals, rodents, reptiles and birds. In
general, most of the fauna represented in the late sites could have
been obtained in the immediate site area or without venturing far
from the streamside camps. As more data become available, we
should be able to examine the seasonality of site occupation given the
presence of migratory waterfowl and other seasonally-specific fauna.
If one compares the faunal lists from the northwestern sector with
those from late prehistoric and early historic aboriginal occupations
in south-central Texas and the south Texas coast, some immediate
differences can be noted. For example, at Scorpion Cave (41 ME 7)
west of San Antonio (see Table 2), antelope, jackrabbit and prairie
dog are absent, probably reflecting local environmental conditions.
Although there is the emphasis on deer and small mammals we saw to
the south, there seems to have also been a preference at this site for
turtles and birds. Interesting is the occurrence of Canada goose, and
greenwing tea!, present in the area only during winter migrations.
In examining the late prehistoric and historic fauna from the
Kirchmeyer site (41 NU 11) on the south Texas coast, we note the
heavier emphasis on locally available marine resources (Table 3).
Bison and whitetail deer remains are present, but antelope and
prairie dog are not. The small mammals were sought (and here,
swamp rabbit is found along with cottontail), and there was the
utilization of reptiles and birds. Note the occurrence of black bear,
also present at Scorpion Cave, but absent elsewhere in the south
Texas faunal record. The domesticates identified at Kirchmeyer are
surface finds, linked either to European use of the site area or to the
known historic Indian occupations at the site.
Speaking in highly general terms, the subsistence endeavors of the
late prehistoric peoples throughout southern Texas reflect locally
(and probably seasonally) available meat resources, but there is a
widespread and apparently heavy use of whitetail deer, small mammals, rodents, fish, and reptiles. Bison may have appeared only
cyclically in the region; we have little evidence of their presence in
Archaic deposits.
There are several other aspects of the late prehistoric period that I
want to very briefly mention. Mortuary practices are poorly known in
the interior; flexed and extended burials seem to have been placed at
random, within and outside of campsites. Along the coast, interment
in discrete cemetery areas was the burial mode. Trade contacts were
widespread. Interior and coastal groups exchanged a variety of
materials. The people of the Brownsville complex apparently main-

tained trade contracts with the Huasteca. Additionally, at some interior campsites of late prehistoric date, obsidian and pottery from
both Mexico and New Mexico have been found.
Population size is unknown. Both the archeological evidence and
early historic records indicate that we are dealing with fairly small
groups, perhaps microbands of 20-60 people.lt is likely that these late
prehistoric groups coalesced seasonally, as they did in early historic
times, to harvest plant foods such as acorns, prickly pear fruits, and
other seasonally available plant resources.
The dating of the late prehistoric in southern Texas remains imprecise. Radiocarbon dates available from five sites indicate a range
from A. D. 1440 to A. D. 1760.Although the latter date would place the
occupations within the historic era, the sites have produced absolutely no evidence of historic contact. I suspect tl~at additional
radiocarbon dates, some currently being processed, will push the
beginning of the late prehistoric back tO around A. D. 1300. In any
event, the late prehistoric in southern Texas is certainly a very late
phenomenon, as it was in parts of the Chihuahuan province.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Given the significant environmental differences between the
Chihuahuan and Tamaulipan provinces, perhaps even more marked
in late prehistoric times, I think there is little to be gained from a
detailed comparison between cultural patterns in the two areas. We
should note, however, the similarities between the late prehistoric
remains from the lower Pecos and the southeastern Trans-Pecos m~d
the materials in southern Texas. Unfortunately, so little is knowl~
about the late prehistoric in the eastern Chihuahuan area that we
cannot go much beyond this generalization.
By the same token, we cannot make sweeping generalizations about
late prehistoric lifeway in southern Texas. We know that the
ecological relationships of that period were different from those of
today, and that we cannot look at late prehistoric patterns of adaptation from the perspective of the modern environment. What appear
to be two distinct adaptations were made, perhaps reflecting little
more than the efficient utilization of local resources. These were the
maritime (or coastal; Rockport, Brownsville) and savannah (interior)
adaptations, which I have outlined in an earlier paper (Hester 1971).
The savannah adaptation, found in the interior, is best known from
the northwestern sector. However, there are hundreds of surface
sites scattered throughout the interior which bear related cultural
materials, in the form of arrow point, bone-tempered pottery and certain lithic tools. Thus, we know that this hypothesized adaptation was
quite widespread and the present radiocarbon evidence also suggests
that it was quite late.
What broke the long-lived Archaic pattern around A. D. 1300-1400?
Beginning at this time, we can recognize changing settlement patterns
and the introduction of new cultural traits, particularly arrow points,
bone-tempered pottery, beveled knives, a core-blade technology, and
so forth. It is possible that the new settlement trends may reflect
nothing more than adjustments to shifting drainage patterns.
However, the new cultural inventory is something distinctly different
from that of the so-called Archaic.
Are we seeing, in this late prehistoric era, the adoption by local
peoples of new traits and activities brought about by environmental
changes, diffusion, or intracultural contacts? Or, are we looking at
the movement of new populations into portions of the region? The
source of such populations might be the Toyah phase of central
Texas, in which very similar cultural inventories are found beginning
around A. D. 1200 (Shafer 1971). Given my research in the region, I
see no firm evidence for this latter explanation. If new groups had

moved in, I think we could recognize co-existing native peoples who
did not accept these new traits. Such is not the case, with the possible
exception of the Falcon Lake-Starr County districts. When one looks
at the overall picture, it is obvious that the new traits of the late
prehistoric are widely distributed throughout the savannah area.
Perhaps there is another process which might better explain the
spread of these new traits into the region. Dillehay (1974) has observed that there was a marked expansion of the bison range around
A. D. 1200-1300. He has also noted the migration of bison herds into
southern Texas at this time, although when he wrote, he did not have
the evidence we have recently obtained, that bison were actually
present as far south as Alice in deep south Texas, 120 miles south of
San Antonio. I find it interesting that the phenomenon of late
prehistoric development in southern Texas coincides with the influx
of bison, a faunal component which had been largely absent (given
our present data) in the Archaic of this region. While I seriously
doubt that any of the south Texas peoples ever became full-fledged
bison hunters, they undoubtedly had to make some readjustments,
particularly in their subsistence system, and perhaps even in the
placement of settlements (cf. Gunnerson 1972). I think that the intrusion of bison brought with it the appearance of new cultural traits.
The Plains-like culture of the Toyah phase peoples had the same kinds
of artifacts that we now see appearing in southern Texas. Are these
new accoutrements nothing more than diffused cultural elements
from the Plains? Are we seeing here the same southward spread
of Plains culture that had a century or two earlier led to the development of the central Texas Toyah phase? Although I have not
thought this out in any detail, I presently favor this explanation as the
major mechanism for the development of late prehistoric culture in
southern Texas.
