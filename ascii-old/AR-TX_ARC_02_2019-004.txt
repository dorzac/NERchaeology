ABSTRACT
The City of Arlington, Texas is planning to restore a 3,100-linear-foot segment of
a Kee Branch tributary. Stantec is handling the environmental permitting. The
portion slated for restoration begins north of Willow Tree Drive, passes through
Deaver Park, and ends at the upstream end of the Andalusia Trail road crossing.
The project area is limited by the city’s easement around the tributary. The
easement ranges from about 8 to 35 meters wide, except in Deaver Park where it
reaches approximately 85 meters. Extensive modern disturbance around the creek
led ARC to hypothesize that the potential for encountering prehistoric or historic
cultural resources was low. The narrow easement resulted in a survey that was
primarily restricted to the creek bed. Approximately 10 acres were surveyed.
No archaeological materials were found during the survey, despite limited shovel
testing in the Kee Branch tributary floodplain and observation of creek bed and
bank exposures. Given the results of this field investigation, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unnecessary, and
requests that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this recommendation.
Records associated with this project will be curated at the Center for Archaeological
Studies, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
A 3,100-linear-foot segment of a first order tributary to Kee Branch is slated for restoration by the
City of Arlington as a part of the Kee Branch Tributary Restoration project in southwest Arlington,
Tarrant County, Texas (Figure 1). The tributary passes behind residential yards in a densely
developed urban area. The segment slated for restoration begins north of Willow Tree Drive,
passes through Deaver Park, and ends at the upstream end of the Andalusia Trail road crossing.
The primary purpose of the restoration project is to reduce streambank erosion and return the
stream to a more natural planform and profile. To do this, the city plans to remove a stock tank
dam located in Deaver Park to restore the connection between the Kee Branch tributary and its
floodplain. Other restoration activities will include the reconfiguration of channel banks to reduce
bank erosion, installation of structures to deflect flows and/or increase shear resistance, and
reduction of sediment structures to improve water quality. A staging area will likely be placed in
an open field in the southwest corner of Deaver Park.
The City of Arlington contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct a cultural resource
survey of the project area. Stantec is handling the environmental permitting for the proposed
project. In the scope of work, dated to January 21, 2019, ARC recommended survey of the
easement along the Kee Branch tributary including, where possible, shovel testing at least every
100 meters and profiling along the creek banks. The survey was performed on February 12, 2019.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Arlington is a State entity. Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 8753 was issued for the archaeological survey. Relevant state and federal
legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter
191), National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Clean Water Act, as amended (PL-92-500),
the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974,
as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the
Cultural Environment,” and Protection of Historic Properties (36 CFR 800). The Fort Worth
District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) will review this report.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of the
THC (Council of Texas Archeologists 2018). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous
investigations in the region surrounding the study area. A chapter on the research design and
methodology employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation.
The report concludes with recommendations followed by the references cited.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF KEE BRANCH TRIBUTARY RESTORATION

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The tributary segment that is scheduled for restoration is part of a first order, intermittent tributary
of Kee Branch. The drainage begins approximately 0.5 miles southwest of the proposed project
area, near the City of Arlington boundary, and flows into Kee Branch 0.2 miles downstream of the
northern project boundary. Kee Branch then flows into Rush Creek approximately 2.5 miles to the
northeast. Rush Creek eventually flows into Village Creek, which converges with the West Fork
Trinity River, nearly 7.0 miles from the confluence of Kee Branch and Rush Creek. This system
is part of the Trinity River Basin.
The proposed project area is situated within the Eastern Cross Timbers subregion of the Cross
Timbers ecoregion of Texas. This subregion is located between the Grand Prairie and Texas
Blackland Prairies regions in eastern Texas. Unlike these other subregions, it consists of an oak
savanna underlain by a narrow strip of Upper Cretaceous sandstone, known as the Woodbine Sand.
The savanna includes post oaks and blackjack oaks interspersed with mid- to tall grasses. In many
places, however, this is replaced by thickets of young trees, shrubs, and vines resulting from fire
suppression and over-grazing (Griffith et al. 2007:37-38).
The project area is mapped over the Upper Cretaceous-aged Woodbine Formation, which consists
of sandstone with some clay and shale (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988: Dallas Sheet). Three
soil series underlie the proposed project area: Gasil sandy clay loam, graded, with 1-5 percent
slopes, Crosstell fine sandy loam with 3-6 percent slopes, Silstid-Urban land complex with 1-5
percent slopes, and Crostell-Urban land complex with 1-6 percent slopes (Ressel 1981). Most of
the project area, from Deaver Park through the downstream end, is underlain by these last two soil
types. The Gasil series consists of a 20 cm Ap horizon with brown fine sandy loam underlain by a
23 cm E horizon with very pale brown fine sandy loam and a reddish yellow sandy clay loam
subsoil (Ressel 1981:31). The Crostell series is characterized by a 13 cm brown fine sandy loam
A horizon underlain by reddish yellow clay subsoil (Ressel 1981:26-27). The Silstid series consist
of a 64 cm pale brown fine sand A horizon underlain by a 30 cm very pale brown fine sand E
horizon and brownish yellow sandy clay loam subsoil (Ressel 1981:51). As indicated in their
names, the Silstid- and Crostell-Urban land complexes contain some soils that are obscured by
urban development.
Though no high-quality toolstone materials are known to be associated with the underlying
geologic formation, there are thin surficial deposits of Miocene-Pliocene-age chert, limestone,
quartzite, quartz, and silicified wood cobbles found intermittently across the region. These are
deposits are known as Uvalde gravels. These gravels are observed, today, on small ridges in
interstream divides approximately 225-510 feet above floodplains (Byrd 1971:29-30; Peter and
McGregor 1988).
The climate in Tarrant County is subtropical, featuring hot and humid summers and dry winters
punctuated by occasional surges of cold air and plummeting temperatures. Average daily high
temperature is 76.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Rainfall peaks in late spring, while dry weather dominates
winter and summer. Average yearly rainfall is 32.1 inches, peaking in the spring months (Ressel
1981:2-3).

CULTURAL HISTORY
The following North Central Texas culture chronology is derived from several comprehensive
studies (Ferring and Yates 1997; Jameson 2016; Prikryl 1990) and is presented below to provide
the reader with a temporal framework for the culture history of the region.
Table 1. Cultural Chronology.

AD 1800 to Present
Protohistoric/Historic Native American AD 1600 to 1850
Late Prehistoric
AD 700 to 1600
Archaic
7000 BC to AD 700
Paleoindian
ca. 11,000 to 7000 BC
Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began at least 10,000 years ago as
attested to by the presence of distinctively-shaped Clovis dart points and radiocarbon-dated
deposits at the Lewisville (Crook and Harris 1957) and Aubrey Clovis sites (Ferring 2001; Ferring
and Yates 1998). Artifact collectors and archaeologists report the presence of Clovis points on the
surface of sites in 149 of the 254 counties in Texas, including 14 of the 29 counties in this region
(Bever and Meltzer 2007:65-66). To date, no Clovis points have been reported in Tarrant County,
in part because archaeologists have limited access to deeply-buried deposits of this age. Folsom,
Scottsbluff, and other later Paleoindian point types have also been recorded by avocational and
professional archaeologists across the state (Jameson 2016:4; Skinner et al. 1978:18). The presence
of exotic lithic toolstone at Paleoindian sites indicates that early people acquired higher quality
lithic materials from distant locations or engaged in systems of raw material exchange. These early
people primarily hunted now-extinct large game, though excavations at multiple sites have yielded
evidence of the use of a variety of resources including smaller game and plants (Bever and Meltzer
2007:Table 1; Crook and Harris 1955; Ferring 2001:239).
Archaic populations lived throughout North Central Texas from as early as 7,000 BC to as late as
AD 700. Though few Archaic sites have received thorough analysis, many surface collections have
been identified across the region (Jameson 2016:4-5). The Archaic period is characterized by a
gradual transition from a wetter to drier climate. Larger sites are typically found along on terraces
or ridges in major and minor stream valleys associated with the Trinity River where huntergatherers could access a variety of plant and animal resources. Smaller lithic scatters have been
recorded in the uplands throughout the area. While earlier Archaic populations continued the use
of exotic cherts for dart points, later groups shifted to local lithic materials, such as Uvalde gravels,
for chipped stone tool manufacture. Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers
are artifacts characteristic of these sites (Byrd 1971; Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Peter and
McGregor 1988).
The climate in North Central Texas became drier during the Late Prehistoric, which spanned ca.
AD 700-1600. This was accompanied by major technological and subsistence changes. There is a
marked Plains influence on Texas lithic tool assemblages of this period, as exemplified by specific
styles of projectile points, scrapers, knives, and drills. As evidence by later sites, bison-hunting
eventually becomes the dominant subsistence strategy. Bison kill sites have been identified along

Denton and White Rock Creeks (Prikryl 1990:77-80). The presence of bison-scapula hoes and a
bison tibia digging stick from sites like Lewisville Lake indicates either the appearance of
horticulture or interactions with horticulturalist groups during this period. This concept is
supported by a shift in primary site locations to sandy terraces from floodplain areas, where earlier
Late Prehistoric sites are found (Barber 1969:18-19; Jameson 2016:6).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general abandonment of the
North Central Texas area. It is thought that abandonment is tied to the increasingly dry climate.
Professional and avocational surveys of the region have yielded little evidence of terminal Late
Prehistoric occupation or sites with trade goods that might have been obtained from French,
Spanish, or English traders. There is very little evidence of protohistoric Native American
occupation anywhere in Tarrant or nearby Dallas County, although historic accounts indicate that
groups were present in the early 1800s (Skinner 1988).
There is tantalizing evidence found on the Trinity River in Dallas County of a possible visit by
Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Artifacts found consist of a chain-mail gauntlet, a halberd,
and a spur. More recent research, however, seems to indicate that Anglo-American settlers in the
early 1800s were the first non-natives to settle in North Central Texas (Bruseth 1992).
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the aboriginal inhabitants continued to play
a role in the history of the region. Garrett (1972:24) states, “Indian hostilities almost depopulated
North Texas (of Anglo dwellers) after 1839. It dwindled to less than half.” Hostilities continued
until the State of Texas and ten Native American tribes signed the Treaty of 1843. This treaty
provided the impetus for settlement of several North Central Texas counties. The earliest AngloAmerican inhabitants of Tarrant County moved to the region ca. 1841 when a military outpost,
known as Fort Bird, was established. Fort Worth, known as Camp Worth prior to the MexicanAmerican War, and Tarrant County were created in 1849 (Jameson 2016:6-7). Cattle driving and
railroads played a major role in the county economy until the late 19th to early 20th century
(Jameson 2016:6-7). Arlington, the town nearest to the proposed project area, was founded as a
market town along the Texas and Pacific Railway in 1876. Cotton, mineral water, and other
agricultural products, such as hay, oats, corn, and peanuts, were important sources of revenue for
the city after its founding. It eventually became a major produce and distribution center for
surrounding towns. The population of Arlington gradually increased until World War II, after
which it rapidly expanded, a process characteristic of the Dallas-Fort Worth region (Shannon
2010).
Previous Investigations
There have been few cultural resource surveys in the area surrounding the proposed project
location. This is especially true of the Kee Branch drainage. In 1984, the National Park Service
sponsored a survey of an approximately 18-acre block area for the City of Arlington Department
of Parks and Recreation. During the survey, the Kee Branch Park Site (41TR69) was recorded.
This site is located approximately 0.45 miles downstream from the current project area. Surface
survey across a 75-by-45-m area yielded seven unmodified flakes, a broken preform, and a Kent
point (Middle to Late Archaic). No artifacts were recovered from shovel testing. Due to soil
deflation and erosion, as well as disturbance from plowing and off-road vehicle traffic, the site was

deemed ineligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). No further archaeological
work was recommended (TASA 2019).
Another site is located directly east of the proposed project area in Deaver Park. The site
(41TR154) consists of a possible historic farmstead recorded by GeoMarine, Inc. as a part of the
Kelly-Elliot Road Park project in 1995. Six standing buildings, including a house and barn, and
other auxiliary features, such as a windmill and concrete trough, were observed. Shovel testing
yielded two wire nails. Because the house remained occupied into the late 20th century, abundant
modern materials were also noted. Ultimately, the site lacked any significant cultural deposits and
was determined to be ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. The site card states that the only
indication that the site was historic was its presence on 1893 and 1920 maps of the area. No further
archaeological work was recommended (TASA 2019).
Although few sites are recorded along Kee Branch and its tributaries, several sites have been
documented along neighboring Rush Creek, located approximately 1.8 miles to the east of Kee
Branch. In 1976, Hayden Whitsett recorded several disturbed lithic scatters, some with projectile
points and other tools, on hills and terraces overlooking Rush Creek. These include sites 41TR5
through 41TR14. None of the sites exhibited potential for listing on the NRHP (TASA 2019). If
any sites existed in the Kee Branch Tributary Restoration project area, small lithic scatters like the
one found at the Kee Branch Park site, rather than those found along Rush Creek, are what would
be expected.
Historic Map & Aerial Review
The following maps were reviewed to help identify possible historic site locations: the 1959, 1968,
1973, and 1981 1:24,000-scale USGS topographic maps for Kennedale, Texas; 1920 Tarrant
County soil map; and 1940 Tarrant County General Highway map. None of these maps show
structures within the proposed project area. However, structures likely associated with the nearby
farmstead site (41TR154) are visible east of the project area as early as 1920.
The earliest available aerial imagery dates to 1958. At this time, a lake is visible at the southern
end of the proposed project area. The farmstead, including several structures, is visible east of the
lake. The remainder of the project area is covered in forest or plowed fields. One other farmstead
is visible well east of Kee Branch along Kelly-Elliot Road. In 1968, the lake appears to be drained,
though it is full again in 1970. Sometime between 1968 and 1970, a housing development began
to form west of Kee Branch. By 1979, it is apparent that rapid development has occurred on both
sides of the creek. Prior to 1990, houses were constructed directly adjacent to the creek. The
development of Deaver Park began sometime in the early 1990s as is evident in the aerial imagery.
Recent images reveal that only a narrow strip of land directly along Kee Branch remains forested
today.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF KEE BRANCH TRIBUTARY RESTORATION

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on research conducted prior to survey, two hypotheses were developed. First, it was
hypothesized that the potential for prehistoric archaeological sites was low. Though Kee Branch,
itself, may have been a more reliable source of water, its tributaries and their floodplains are narrow
and would have only held water seasonally. There is also a lack of high-quality toolstone materials
and limited availability of Uvalde gravels, what prehistoric peoples in the area likely used to
manufacture tools. This lack of perennially available waters and limited availability of local, highquality toolstone suggest that this area may not have been ideal for longer-term prehistoric
settlement. Additionally, the high degree of modern disturbance from housing developments along
the tributary make it unlikely that any existing sites along the tributary remain intact.
The second hypothesis states that there was low potential for encountering historic sites within the
project area. A review of historic maps and aerial imagery revealed that no structures or features
existed within the area slated for impact. However, archaeologists have noted the potential for
historic trash scatters to be found along roadways and drainage crossings.
Methodology
Crew members began survey at the south end of the Kee Branch Tributary Restoration project area
in Deaver Park and worked downstream. The easement and project boundary were widest in the
park, where the boundary extended from a newly paved sidewalk to a small drainage along the
western edge of the park. Two transects were surveyed in this area: one between the unnamed
tributary to the west and Kee Branch to the east and the other between Kee Branch and the
sidewalk. These were approximately 50 meters apart. Shovel tests were placed in potentially
undisturbed areas where ground visibility was low along these transects in accordance with the
standards set forth by the THC (2014). These averaged 30 cm in diameter. The sandy sediments
were screened through ¼” mesh. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of composition,
texture, and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify soil colors. Shovel
test and other project element locations were marked with a handheld GPS receiver.
Due to a narrow easement, extensive damage to creek stabilization elements (riprap, concrete
walls, retaining walls, etc.), steep, eroding banks, and the presence of numerous fenced yards that
backed the creek, the remaining project area was surveyed primarily from the creek bed. Creek
banks and other exposed ground surfaces were observed for cultural materials. Profiles of the
banks were documented and photographed where possible. Crew members made notes about and
extensively photographed the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, disturbances, and disturbed
areas where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken during the survey using a GPSequipped, digital camera.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the project area’s natural setting along
with results of the pedestrian survey. Shovel tests (STs) and profiles are described generally throughout
the text and detailed in Tables 2 and 3 at the end of the chapter. Conclusions derived from the survey
close the chapter.
Survey Results

Fieldwork revealed that much of the landscape surrounding the proposed project area was highly
disturbed due to modern housing developments along the tributary, past stabilization efforts,
flooding, and severe erosion (Figure 2). Survey began at the southernmost end of the project area,
just south of the park. This segment, which crosses under Willow Creek Drive, consists of a long,
paved concrete drainage ditch, also visible in recent aerial imagery (Figure 3). To the north, the
environment of Deaver Park consists of the 3-5 m wide tributary and another small drainage to the
west surrounded by open, cleared and mowed fields and relatively open oak forest with abundant
secondary growth as well as grasses, greenbriar, and vines (Figure 4). The lake remains visible,
though the water level is low due to flooding that damaged the dam and drained some of the water
(Figure 5 and Figure 6). The area that once contained the farmstead (41TR154) to the east of the
tributary consists of open, mowed fields interspersed with large oak trees, a baseball field,
playground, and other features associated with the park (Figure 7).
Two transects were surveyed in the park, where the proposed project area was widest (ranging
from 60-90 m wide). Because the potential for encountering undisturbed ground was higher in the
park, where crew members could more easily access the floodplain, five shovel tests were placed
along these transects. ST1, ST3, and ST5 were placed on the western transect between a small
drainage and the tributary to Kee Branch (Figure 8). ST1 was positioned near the southeast corner
of the park, in a cleared field in the tributary floodplain (Figure 9). A staging area will likely be
placed at this location. This ST exposed 13 cm of brown fine sandy loam, followed by 17 cm of
yellowish brown sandy loam and strong brown sandy loam. An asphalt chunk was recovered at
approximately 35 cm, which led to the conclusion that the area was previously disturbed. ST3 was
placed in the woods along the smaller drainage, north of this cleared field. This ST exposed 35 cm
of brown fine sand underlain by over 70 cm of grayish brown fine sand. ST5 was the northernmost
shovel test along this western transect and contained 30 cm of very dark grayish brown sandy clay
loam, followed by 60 cm of brown fine sand and grayish brown sandy clay loam with yellowish
brown mottles. ST2 and ST4 were placed on the eastern transect between the tributary and a newly
paved sidewalk (Figure 10). ST2 exposed 12 cm of dark brown fine sand, 44 cm of dark yellowish
brown sand, and yellowish brown sandy clay loam subsoil. Approximately 50 meters north of this
was ST4, which exposed 6 cm of brown sandy loam, 8 cm of yellowish brown sandy clay loam,
15 cm of strong brown sandy clay, and brownish yellow sandy clay subsoil with light gray clay
balls. No artifacts or features were observed in any of these shovel tests.
For the remainder of the project area, survey was primarily restricted to the creek bed. The
environment and vegetation were similar to that of Deaver Park, with the exception of open,
mowed fields. There were also a few patches of invasive bamboo stands, likely associated with
resident’s backyards. In addition to the easement being narrow, ranging from approximately 8 to
35 meters wide, several of the houses along it had fenced yards that extended to the creek’s edge

prohibiting survey or shovel testing in the associated floodplain or terrace (Figure 11 and Figure
12). Highly eroded, steep banks and damaged stabilization elements such as riprap, concrete walls,
retaining walls, and other features also prevented survey beyond the creek bed (Figure 13 and
Figure 14). A single shovel test was placed in a location where the floodplain was accessible,
approximately 165 m north of Deaver Park (Figure 15). ST6 exposed 8 cm of very dark grayish
brown sand underlain by 72 cm of dark yellowish brown sand, and light brownish gray sandy clay
loam subsoil with pockets of strong brown. No artifacts or features were observed in this shovel
test.
Three bank profiles were recorded throughout the survey (Table 3). Profile 1 was located
approximately 20 m south of ST6 on the west bank of the tributary (Figure 16). Four strata were
visible in the profile: 16 cm of brown sandy loam with abundant root matter, 32 cm of light gray
sand with less roots, 38 cm of mottled very pale brown and strong brown sandy clay loam, and
mottled light gray and strong brown sandy clay subsoil. The creek level was determined to lie at
approximately 200 cm below the ground surface. Profile 2 was recorded on the east bank,
approximately 250 m north of the Profile 1 location. Three strata were visible in this profile: 13
cm of brown sandy loam with abundant root matter, 19 cm of very pale brown sandy loam, and a
mottled light gray, strong brown, and red sandy clay subsoil. The water level was 102 cm below
the surface at this location. Approximately 300 meters further downstream, Profile 3 was recorded
(Figure 17). Four strata were visible in this profile: 12 cm of brown sandy loam with abundant
roots, 22 cm of very pale brown sand, 110 cm of mottled very pale brown and strong brown sandy
clay loam, and a mottled light gray, strong brown, and red sandy clay subsoil. The water level and
sandstone bedrock, part of the Woodbine Formation, were visible at approximately 224 cm below
the ground surface. Additional exposed profiles were photographed, especially if bedrock was
visible, though measurements were not recorded in cases where it was difficult for crew members
to access the banks. No artifacts or features were observed in exposed areas along the tributary
banks or in the profiles.
The northernmost, downstream end of the proposed restoration area is similar to the southern end.
Here, the tributary passes beneath Andalusia Trail via a concrete drainage. The tributary north of
Andalusia Trail is filled with riprap and debris and heavily eroded, similar to other sections in the
project area. No prehistoric or historic materials were observed along the entire length of the area
slated for restoration.

Conclusions
Little evidence of prehistoric or historic cultural resources was expected to be found during survey
of the Kee Branch Tributary Restoration project area. These expectations were based on the lack
of reliable, perennial water sources and limited availability of local, high-quality lithic raw
materials, absence of historically-documented structures and features, and extent of modern
disturbance throughout the project area. No archaeological sites, features, or artifacts were
identified on or below the surface during this survey.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present in
association with a 3,100-linear-foot segment of a Kee Branch tributary slated for restoration in
southwestern Arlington, Tarrant County, Texas. No archaeological sites were observed or
recorded. ARC concludes that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted within the
proposed project area and recommends that the USACE and THC concur with this assessment.
However, if buried cultural materials are discovered during project activities, the Fort Worth
District of the USACE and the Archeology Division of the THC should be notified.
