A Technological Analysis of Lithic Assemblages from
Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Texas

Richard Boisvert

ABSTRACT
This report concerns the analysis of lithic artifacts collected during the 1970
Texas Archeological Society Field School from 120 prehistoric sites in Guadalupe
Mountains National Park, Texas. Research is focused upon three topics: the role of
raw material selection in chipped stone tool manufacture, assessment of flaking
behavior on the basis of an attribute analysis of the debitage, and identification of
potential cultural-temporal-ecological significance of the individual chipped stone
tool assemblages. Significant patterns of raw material utilization are noted in the
assemblage at large. The debitage study has revealed that certain stages of chipped
stone tool manufacture can be identified. Analysis of the tool assemblages revealed no
significant cluster of tool forms with the exception of one apparent tool kit that
appears to have temporal and ecological significance. An assessment of the quality of
the research methodologies is also presented.

INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of an analysis of the lithic assemblage
gathered from more than 100 archeological sites in or adjacent to the
Guadalupe Mountains of Trans-Pecos Texas. Three research problems are
defined and analyzed in detail. They are:
1) What were the raw materials selected to make chipped stone tools, and
were there significant relationships between these materials and the
forms into which they were processed?
2) What were the techniques applied in the manufacture of chipped stone
tools?
3) What were the variations through time and space of these artifacts and
of the assemblages they constituted?
These are interrelated problems and they incorporate the premise that the
form of an implement is determined by (1) the kind of material used, (2) the
techniques applied to fashion it, and (3) the use(s) for which it was intended
and employed.
The data for this study were collected by the Texas Archeological Society
(TAS) during its 1970 field school. Harry Shafer and Dessamae Lorrain

directed the survey in parts of Hudspeth and Culberson counties, Texas, in
anticipation of the area’s development into a national park. The data on the
ceramics and rock art have been analyzed and published by Phelps (1974) and
Clark (1974), respectively, and a study of the historic sites also has been
undertaken.
The purpose of this study is to increase our knowledge of the culture
history of the area that is now Guadalupe Mountains National Park. The
survey conducted there by the TAS accumulated a collection of artifacts
dominated by lithics, primarily cores, flakes, unifaces, and numerous chipped
stone implement fragments. Although the majority of these artifacts are
nondiagnostic, they furnish a significant data base for the study of lithic
technology.
Another goal is to explore the potential of debitage analysis as an aid to
obtaining insights into prehistoric behavior and to discover what can be
learned from, and what are the limitations of, this kind of data.
The systematic analysis of chipped stone artifacts has been of interest to
archeologists for many years. William H. Holmes, second director of the
Smithsonian Institution, devoted much of his research to the investigation of
prehistoric quarry and workshop sites, first in the Potomac Basin area around
Washington, D.C., and later in other parts of North America (Holmes 1897).
He pioneered the study of lithic technology in North America and laid the
groundwork for later studies. He roughly outlined the stages of reduction and
shaping required for the manufacture of bifacial artifacts. His best-known
contribution was the definition of the intermediate stage of biface manufacture
that is usually termed the preform or blank. He accomplished this by
systematically analyzing the broken bifaces at quarry and workshop sites.
However, in order to arrive at his conclusions, Holmes did not analyze the
flakes removed from the cores and preforms; rather, he inferred the flaking
process from study of both intact and broken bifaces from the sites.
Another benchmark in the study of American lithic technology is the
work of William H. Ellis (1940), who, elaborating on the work of Holmes,
systematically carried out a series of replicative experiments in flint knapping
aimed at defining the techniques of stone tool manufacture. He identified
various techniques of direct and indirect percussion and pressure flaking, and
he commented on their effectiveness for performing various tasks in the
manufacture of chipped stone tools. He described in some detail the chippage
that results from the different fabricating techniques (Ellis 1940:1 !-39). His
work was almost tota!ly based upon replicative experiments, and he made
only peripheral reference to ethnographic analogies, except to mention that
the techniques he found most suitable were not always chosen by the
aborigina! knappers (Ellis 1940:61). Curiously, Ellis never applied his
findings to archeologically derived data bases.
Subsequently many other researchers have taken up this neglected task
and have begun to study not only the products of chipped stone tool
manufacture, but also the by-products. Interpretations of prehistoric lithic
technologies that draw from the experimental base have been initiated and
are typified by the work of M.B. Collins (1974) and Don E. Crabtree (1972).
Both men are experienced knappers, and both have applied their findings to

the interpretation of the archeological record. It is with this intent that the
debitage analysis component of this report has been undertaken.
This report is a technological analysis of chipped stone artifacts. It is an
attempt to bring together several lines of inquiry in the hope of discovering
the ways in which certain prehistoric peoples made their stone tools. The
study is also an attempt to formulate, utilize, and assess certain methodological
approaches toward the analysis of chipped stone technology, especially as it
relates to assemblages drawn from surface collection surveys.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Guadalupe Mountains National Park is in northeastern Trans-Pecos
Texas in parts of Hudspeth and Culberson counties (Figure 1). The park
includes the southernmost part of the Guadalupe Mountains, which extend
southward into Texas from New Mexico, as well as parts of the adjacent
Patterson Hills and surrounding desert and salt flats, covering 31,371 ha
(77,518 acres) and varying in elevation from 1112 meters (3,650 ft.) at the base
of the western escarpment to 2667 meters (8,751 feet) atop Guadalupe Peak
(Figure 2). Geologically the mountains are part of the Permian Reef complex
of Texas and New Mexico and are composed mainly of limestone, dolomite,
and sandstone. The environmental and ecological variations that result from
the extremes in elevation make this area unique. The high reef escarpment,
rising from the scorched and desiccated desert, is penetrated by steep-sided
canyons and supports a perennially green conifer forest.

Geology

The present-day nature of the Guadalupe Mountains region is the result
of geologic processes. In the early part of the Permian period, the Delaware
Basin developed in what is now Trans-Pecos Texas and southeastern New
Mexico. On the margin of the basin a series of reefs--the Permian Reef
complex--formed. Parts of this reef have survived essentially intact as the
Glass, Apache, and, most notably, Guadalupe mountains.
The Guadalupe Mountains are a great wedge that protrudes southeastward into Texas from New Mexico, terminating abruptly at the
spectacular promontory E1 Capitan. The mountains make up the northern
half of an eastward-tiIting block of the earth’s crust that measures about 160
km (100 miles) from north to south by 80 km (50 miles) from east to west.
The southeastward facing Reef Escarpment... extends diagonally across the
tilted surface, following an ancient tectonic and stratigraphic axis, along which
the limestones of the Guadalupe Mountains come to an end .... On the west side
of the tilted block, the mountains break off in steep escarpments .... The
escarpments slope toward the Salt Basin, a depression with no outlet to the sea,
whose lower part stands at an altitude above 3,600 feet, or nearly a mile below
the summit of Guadalupe Peak not far away. Extending westward from the
lowest benches of the basin is a great alluvial apron composed of detritus
washed down from the mountains. Rising from the alluvium in places are low
rock ridges, such as the Patterson Hills southwest of E1 Capitan [King 1948:5].

The Guadalupe Mountains consist principally of limestone and sandstone
and occasional shale formations. The thick, massive Capitan and Carlsbad
limestones make up more than 90 percent of the Guadalupes and the
Patterson Hills (Figure 2), which adjoin the mountains on the southwest.
Underneath these limestones are other formations ofinterbedded limestones,
sandstones, shales, and quartzites. These are found on the south and east
edges of the Guadalupe Mountains and along the east side of the Patterson
Hills. The few cherts that are found in the southern Guadalupes are in these
rocks, principally on the eastern escarpment in the Manzanita Member of the
Brushy Canyon Formation. The floors of Dog Canyon, West Dog Canyon,
and the desert surrounding the mountains are of alluvium. These alluvial
deposits vary from fine-grained bolson deposits and sand dunes west of the
mountains to slope deposits and gravels on the flanks of the mountains and
on the desert to the east.
A brief survey turned up poor-grade cherts cropping out in the
Manzanita Member of the Brushy Canyon Formation and small nodules
(about 10 cm in diameter) of higher quality cherts in the gravels below the
southeast escarpment. Less than two days were spent in the attempt to locate
sources of chippable stone in the region, so it is likely that further
investigations might result in the discovery of deposits of higher quality
chippable stone that would have been available to the prehistoric residents of
the Guadalupes (see Boisvert 1980: Appendix I for a more detailed discussion
of the geology of the park area).
Climate
The National Park Service describes the climate in the park as variable
and often extreme.
Summertime temperatures may be disagreeably hot at lower elevations while
the highlands and moist canyons are cool by contrast. The western escarpment
produces a reflector-oven effect on the west side lowlands which creates
pleasant conditions during cool winter months. At the same time, the highlands
can be bitterly cold and snowy [National Park Service 1974:34].

The officially recorded extremes of temperature at the 1524-meter (5,000 ft.)
elevation are -200 C. (-60 F.) in January and 350 C. (960 F.) in July. Annual
precipitation in the park is 56 cm (22.23 in.), but most of it falls in the higher
elevations, especially above 2000 meters (7,000 ft.). High winds are common,
especially from late fall to early spring, often reaching 95 to 130 kph (60-80
mph). The record high wind is 180 kph (110 mph) on January 25, 1967
(National Park Service 1974:34-35).
Life Zones
Four life zones are recognized in the park: the Lower Sonoran arid
division of the Lower Austral zone, the Upper Sonoran arid division of the
Upper Austral zone, the Transition zone, and the Canadian zone (Bailey
1928:16-18). The Lower and Upper Sonoran divisions and the Transition
zone each cover about a third of the park, but the Canadian zone covers only a
very small area at the highest elevations (Figure 3). The division between the
Lower and Upper Sonoran zones is usually at the 1400 meter (4,500 ft.)

6

elevation, with variations resulting from local topography. The Upper
Sonoran zone tends to extend down below 1400 meters (4,500 ft.) on
eastward-facing canyons and slopes, and tends to retreat above 1400 meters
(4,500 ft.) on westward-facing slopes. This difference is the result of the
desiccating effect of the prevailing winds, which blow across the salt flats
toward the mountains. The Upper Sonoran and Transition zones meet at
about 2000 meters (7,000 ft.). The dividing line between the Transition and
Canadian zones can be fixed at about 2600 meters (8,500 ft.), restricting the
Canadian to the top of the highest mountains in the park (Burns 1967:8).
Although there is an overlap in the life forms that inhabit these zones, each
zone has its own floral and faunal assemblages.
Lower Sonoran Life Zone
The Lower Sonoran life zone covers the western and southern parts of
the park, where it is interrupted only by the Patterson Hills (Figure 3). Most
of the area is situated in the sand dune region between the salt flats and the
western escarpment. The southern part of the zone is east of the Patterson
Hills and has somewhat more relief where low sandstone ridges of the Brushy
Canyon and Cherry Canyon formations protrude through the alluvia!
deposits.
A survey of the flora and fauna of the park was made by the TAS field
school in conjunction with the archeological survey. The predominant plants
recorded in the Lower Sonoran zone were creosote bush, mesquite (which
were bearing many beans at the time), prickly pear and cholla cacti, sotol,
agave, lechuguilla, and narrow leaf yuccas. Pincushion, barrel, bear, small
spine, and Englemann’s cacti also were seen, as were althorn, catclaw, grama
grass, and a variety of other grasses and small plants, making up a typical
xerophytic plant community.
The fauna recorded during the survey in the Lower Sonoran zone
included jackrabbits, cottontails, various species of small rodents and lizards,
mockingbird, and quail. In addition, a variety of snakes were recorded:four
kinds of rattlesnakes, garter snakes, hognose snakes, and racers or whipsnakes
(Gehlbach 1964:1-10). Skunks, roadrunners, orioles, cactus woodpeckers,
Texas nighthawks, and white-necked ravens also are found in this area of the
Chihuahuan Desert (Bailey 1928:11-12).
Upper Sonoran Life Zone
The Upper Sonoran zone occupies a broad belt along the western and
southeastern escarpments of the Guadalupes. With few exceptions the zone is
hilly, with steep-sided canyons cutting into the massif. The few level areas that
do exist, between 1400 and 2000 meters (4,500 and 7,000 ft.) are dissected by
numerous and often deep arroyos, which originate in the canyons above. Due
to its higher elevation and proximity to the areas of higher rainfall in the
mountain interior, this zone tends to be more moist than the Lower Sonoran
zone. In addition, many springs are scattered along the front of the reef.
The flora recorded in the Upper Sonoran zone include all of the yuccas
and cacti of the Lower Sonoran zone with the addition of pitaya and

mammillaria cacti. Trees are more common in the Upper Sonoran, especially
on the canyon floors and at the springs. Among the trees are bigtooth maple,
five varieties of oak, juniper, spruce, mountain spout mahogany, ponderosa
pine, and, occasionally, pinyon pine, Texas walnut, willow, and ironwood.
Added to the small xerophytic plants and grasses of the Lower Sonoran that
are duplicated here are such plants as Nolina texana, or basket grass.
The fauna supported in the Upper Sonoran zone are varied. Bailey
(1928:16) reports "Texas mountain sheep, grey mule deer, rock squirrel,
Rowles white footed mouse, white throated rat, gray fox, horned lark, raven"
and many other birds. Also in the area are porcupines, jackrabbits, desert
cottontails, kangaroo rats, wood rats, numerous small rodents, and owls
(Lundelius 1979). Burns (1967:10) reports that reptiles occur less frequently
here than in the Lower Sonoran.

Transition Life Zone
The Transition zone occupies the central and north central part of the
park. The region is cut by canyons and is marked by high, rugged mountains,
woods, and parklands, and a wide variety of trees and plants thrive. Surviving
in the Bowl (Figure 2) is a mixed mesophytic Pleistocene relic forest, one of
the unique ecological aspects of the park.
The TAS spent little survey time in the Transition zone, and no records
were made on the flora and fauna, but the area has been described by Bailey.
This zone is strongly marked by the yellow pine, with huge scaly trunks in wide
stretches of beautiful open forest, clear, and grassy underneath. Douglas spruce,
southern white pine, large-leaved maple, New Mexico oak and locust occupy
secondary places in the forest. Extensive open parks or grassy glades appear ....
The characteristic mammals are white-tailed and mule deer, two species of
chipmunks, a small form of the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, the Colorado
wood rat, Guadalupe meadow mouse, fulvous pocket gopher, mountain
cottontail and brown bat [Bailey 1928:18].

The avifauna include Merriam’s wild turkey, band-tailed pigeon, spotted owl,
screech owl, woodpecker, scaled quail, dove, and a variety of smaller birds.
Burns (1967) also reports that the red-tailed hawk and golden eagle are found.
The faunal inventory includes the cottontail, squirrel, badger, fox, bobcat,
coyote, and porcupine.
Canadian Life Zone
The Canadian zone is restricted to the summits of Brush Mountain,
Bartlett Peak, Shumard Peak, and Guadalupe Peak (Figure 3). Bailey
(1928:18) reports that the flora consists of spruce, fir, and aspen forests with
many other Rocky Mountain plant species. Among the rare and endangered
flora of the park is a stand of no more than a hundred quaking aspens on a
hillside with a northeast exposure southeast of Brush Mountain. The stand is
not reproducing and is steadily diminishing in size (National Park Service
1974:90).
The fauna once included the now extinct Merriam elk; mountain lion
and big horn sheep, now very rare, were also present. This small zone is
relatively unimportant today, except as an ecological isolate, but it was once
much more widespread in the southern Guadalupes.

Summary
Environmentally, the Guadalupe Mountains National Park area is
extremely diverse. Confined within its 200 square kilometers (120 square
miles) are four major life zones that include isolated relics of a verdant
Pleistocene forest, permanent flowing streams, and alkali flats. The elevation
ranges between 1100 and 2700 meters (3,650 to 8,750 ft.) within a distance of
11 km (7 miles). Some areas are nearly level and are covered with sand dunes;
others have deep arroyos with precipitous clifflike sides, the products of
furious flash floods. At first glance the region seems barren and devoid of life,
but upon further inspection even the burnt umber landscape of the desert
discloses a wide range of plant and animal life.

ARCHEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOHISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Halfa century has passed since publication of the first archeological field
report from the Guadalupe Mountains. Investigations have been conducted
intermittently there since that time, yet the region is by no means well known
or understood. The four cultural-historical stages--Paleo-Indian, Archaic,
Neo-American (also called Late Prehistoric), and Historic--of Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks (1954) are all recognized in the region. The information
available for each of these stages from the southern Guadalupes is summarized
below.
Paleo-lndian Stage
The Paleo-Indian stage, a late Pleistocene and early post-Pleistocene
hunting and gathering adaptation, has at least two manifestations in North
America, distinguished by both geographical and cultural factors. On one
hand is the big-game-hunting Paleo-eastern tradition, and on the other, the
gathering-oriented Paleo-western tradition (Wormington 1957:21). Paleoeastern materials, generally found east of the Rocky Mountains, are typified by
distinctive, often fluted, lanceolate projectile points. The well-known associations between these points and extinct Pleistocene fauna have been
responsible for the identification of big game hunting as part of the culture
pattern, but a paucity of excavated Paleo-Indian habitation sites (as opposed
to kill sites) has made it difficult to assess the significance of the gathering and
small-game-hunting aspects of Paleo-eastern subsistence. Although the
evidence is meager, there is a consensus among investigators in the field that
plant collecting played a significant role in the Paleo-eastern life-style (Irwin
1971:46).
The Paleo-western tradition is less clearly defined than is the Paleoeastern. The rarity of associations between recognized western Paleo-Indian
projectile points and Pleistocene fauna suggests that big game hunting was
not especially important. Irwin (1971:58) has suggested that some big game
hunting may have taken place early in the Paleo-western tradition, but it gave
way to a more diverse gathering economy.

Archaic Stage
The term Archaic stage was first used by William Ritchie (1932) to
describe adaptations in New York. The definition has been modified to
include a large part of North America, including Texas (Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks 1954:18). The Archaic, which overlaps the Paleo-Indian, is a generalized
hunting and gathering subsistence pattern that persisted for several millennia.
There is ample evidence in terms of both tool kits and botanical remains that
plant food collecting played a major role in Archaic stage subsistence. Pottery
and indications of agriculture are absent, except during the final part of the
stage, when they appear as either products of internal development or, more
commonly, results of diffusion. In a broad sense, the Archaic stage can be
equated with the Old World Mesolithic in that it exemplifies a broad-based
hunting and gathering post-Pleistocene adaptation.

10

Texas Archeological Society

Neo-American Stage
According to the terminology of Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954), the
next prehistoric stage in Texas is the Neo-American. Subsistence in this stage
includes agriculture, but the presence of the bow and arrow shows that
hunting was still practiced. Ceramic technology is another hallmark of the
Neo-American. Permanent settlements were larger; some even approached
urban levels. However, Krieger reports that the two new traits--ceramics and
agriculture--do not necessarily appear simultaneously; consequently, NeoAmerican is applied to any group that had two of the traits (Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks 1954:20).

Historic Stage
The Historic stage is defined as beginning when European artifacts are
found associated with native American sites. At the time of contact between
the Spanish and the native populations, groups having both Archaic and
Neo-American lifeways were living in Trans-Pecos Texas. This was a
dynamic period in which groups underwent rapid change and, in some cases,
extinction. Records left by the early Spanish adventurers and chroniclers not
only describe the fate of these people but also provide some information on
their life-styles. For this reason the Historic stage is especially important in
the interpretation of Trans-Pecos archeology.
Cultural-Historical Stages in the Park Area
The Guadalupe Mountains are on the southeastern periphery of the
Rocky Mountains, with the southern Plains, including the Llano Estacado,
on the east, and an arid basin and range system of the American Southwest on
the west. South of the Guadalupes is the extensive Chihuahuan Desert, which
stretches deep into Coahuila and Chihuahua, Mexico. Culturally, the
Guadalupes are in the Northeastern district of the Trans-Pecos region as
defined by Lehmer (1958:110). The other districts are E1 Paso at the western
extreme of Texas, La Junta along the Rio Grande below E1 Paso, and
Southeastern along the lower Pecos River (Figure 4).
This subdivision unfortunately belies the actual interrelationship of the
Trans-Pecos to major culture areas. Lehmer’s E1 Paso and, possibly, La Junta
districts (at least during the first millennium A.D.) should be included in the
Southwest culture area, and his Southeastern district is in the Northeastern
Mexico culture area (Willey 1966:329). Lehmer’s Northeastern district should
be viewed as transitional between the Southwest, Plains, and Northeastern
Mexico culture areas (Figure 4). Indeed the existence of the Trans-Pecos
region is a result of modern investigators’attempts to fit that part of a modern
geopolitical unit into an existing archeological framework. As work in the
area progresses and relations are clearly established with other culture areas
it may become advisable to abandon Trans-Pecos as an archeological
subdivision. However, until that happens, the Trans-Pecos is useful for
identifying a geographical study area,
Following is a review of the cultural-historical stages within the
Northeastern district of the Trans-Pecos of Texas, with emphasis on the
southern Guadalupe Mountains and the relationship between this area and
adjacent regions.

Paleo-lndian Sites
The best evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation in the Guadalupe
Mountains is outside the park in Burnet Cave, a dry cave in New Mexico
about 30 km (20 miles) north of the Texas-New Mexico border and 50 km (30
miles) west of Carlsbad. There, in an essentially undisturbed deposit, E.B.
Howard (1932) uncovered, at depths from I to 2.5 meters (3 to 8 ft.) below the
surface, the remains of more than ten extinct animals or animal species that
are no longer found in the region. The faunal inventory consisted of "an
extinct four horned antelope (Tetrameryx), two extinct horses (Equus
fraternus and E. complicatus), extinct bison (Bison alleni), extinct musk-ox
(Bootherium sp), a large extinct camel, extinct California condor, and a
number of other bird bones, including those of the wild turkey" (Howard
1932:15). Howard also found the remains of marmots (Marmotafalviventris),
which have been significant in the interpretation of the Paleo-environment
(Murray 1957; Antevs 1954).
In addition to the faunal material, Howard (1932:13) also found a Clovis
point: "The depth at which our spear-point was found was five feet seven
inches below the surface and about four feet below the level of the Basket
Maker burial. As I mentioned we had to move a large rock which was directly
over the hearth, which contained the point." Howard proposed that the
location of the hearth below the Basketmaker level and the quantity of broken
horse, bison, and camel bones indicated that these animals were hunted by the
makers of the Clovis point. He admitted that the fractured condition of the

12

Texas Archeological Society

bones could be explained by roof fall, but at this time, with the benefit of
hindsight, his suggestion that the animals were hunted by the makers of the
Clovis point seems more likely to be the correct interpretation.
In the early 1950s a sample was taken from Burnet Cave materials for
radiocarbon dating, and a date of 7432+_ 300 years B.P. was obtained
(Wormington 1957:33). However, the composition of the faunal inventory
and the much earlier dates for Clovis material in the Southwest have
prompted Wormington (1957:33) to suggest that this date is too recent.
Within the park there have been several finds of Paleo-Indian projectile
points. Paul and Susanna Katz (1974:54-55) report the base of a probable
Plainview point from a site on a bench on the southeast reef front at the north
end of the Patterson Hills, and the base of a probable Midland point from a
ridge in the northwestern part of the park. They also found a biface fragment,
which they attribute to the Paleo-Indian stage, at a site (41CU31) in Pine
Spring Canyon (Figure 2). These artifacts are the only signs of Paleo-Indian
occupation in the extreme southern part of the Guadalupe Mountains.
Joe Ben Wheat (n.d.) has studied extensive deposits of Paleo-Indian
materials from a multicomponent site in the Van Horn area, 96 km (60 miles)
south of the park. Occupation of the site extends from early Paleo-lndian
through late Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Neo-American stages; the site covers
about 3 ha (9 acres) and was once probably stratified (Wheat n.d.), although
most of the material is now on the surface. Wheat reports that the inventory of
Folsom materials includes 100 Folsom points, 425 end scrapers, 400 side
scrapers, 52 gravers, 11 burins, 16 notches, and 80 channel flakes. In addition,
San Jon, Plainview, Agate Basin, and possibly Milnesand points have been
recovered. The site is on a chain of late Pleistocene playa lakes and alkali fiats
in a setting that resembles the physiography to the west of the Guadalupes.
All of the Paleo-Indian materials that have been discovered thus far
relate to the Paleo-eastern tradition; no Paleo-western (gathering-oriented)
Paleo-Indian materials have been identified in the southern Guadalupes,
although some may yet be found. Collins (1976) has proposed that such a
gathering-oriented (Paleo-western) terminal Pleistocene adaptation existed
on the lower Pecos River some 482 km (300 miles) to the southeast in
Lehmer’s Southeastern district (Figure 4). He has further proposed that there
was no cultural continuity between the terminal Pleistocene big-gamehunting peoples and the earliest Archaic cultures (Collins 1976:22). This
raises the question that there may be as yet unidentified non-big-gamehunting Paleo-Indian cultures in the Pecos River region and adjacent areas.
A rchaic Sites

The Archaic of northeastern Trans-Pecos Texas is still poorly understood.
Radiocarbon dates are rare because few excavations, especially of stratified
sites, have been carried out since the introduction of the technique.
Consequently, it is difficult to make precise statements about the nature and
chronology of Archaic manifestations in the area. The presence of many
Archaic stage projectile points and other coeval artifacts does suggest that a
wide range of Archaic manifestations may be present.

Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954:31) consider the Cochise culture, defined
by Sayles and Antevs ( 194 I), as the ultimate source for the Archaic cultures of
the region. Cochise has considerable antiquity; its earliest phase has
associations with now extinct Pleistocene fauna. Irwin-Williams (1967:454)
reports some radiocarbon dates that range between 9300 and 8300 B.P. for
the Sulphur Springs (earliest) phase. The San Pedro (latest) phase, dates
between 4000 and 2000 B.P. The Cochise culture thus covers an immense span
of time. Sayles and Antevs interpreted the Cochise as having a gatheringoriented subsistence base, with hunting playing only a minor part. Milling
stones dominate the artifact assemblage, especially in the first two stages, with
chipped stone becoming frequent only during the last stage. Most of the
Cochise finds come from Arizona and New Mexico and may not have a direct
application to the Trans-Pecos.
To the southeast, in the Lower Pecos region, is another cluster of sites
that contain evidence of gathering-oriented Archaic cultures. Collins has
synthesized data from 20 components in seven sites that range in time between
14,500 and 5000 B.P. On the basis of his analysis, "the beginnings of a long
Archaic tradition of plant food gathering, fishing, and small game hunting
occur around 9000 years ago" (Collins 1976:22). In the early part of the
Archaic, from 9000 to 5500 B.P., rabbits and rodents were the basic animal
foods; deer were hunted regularly only after 5500 B.P. Direct evidence for
exploitation of plant food was not preserved in most cases, but the artifact
inventory of bifaces, choppers, and grinding stones makes it reasonable to
assume that plant foods were probably quite important.
The subsistence strategy for the early Archaic, and quite possibly for
most of the Archaic, seems to be oriented more toward gathering than
hunting. This is inferred from patterns of the Cochise culture to the west and
the Lower Pecos River culture to the southeast. These patterns may not be
applicable to the southern Guadalupes, but the environmental similarities
and comparable artifact inventories from at least a few sites indicate that the
analogy may in fact be appropriate.
There is a nearly total lack of information on the early Archaic in the
vicinity of the southern Guadalupes, but there is not quite such a void on the
later Archaic. Lehmer (1948) defines the Hueco phase as the precursor of the
Jornada branch of the Mogollon, a Neo-American stage culture. The Hueco
phase was originally described by Sayles (1935) as the Hueco Cave Dweller
phase. The Hueco seems to have had a broader material culture than did the
previous Cochise or Cochise-like culture and may represent some degree of
specialization in subsistence. The Hueco phase has been summarized as
having
... unhafted choppers, leaf blades, drills, flake knives, several kinds of projectile
points, core scrapers and grinding tools, including manos and metates, and
mortars and pestles. Mortar holes are deep and cylindrical with rounded
bottoms and are found in boulders and rock outcrops. Pestles are long and
tapered to the top from a point justabove the grinding surfaces which are flat or
convex along the axis; occasionally wedge-shaped cross sections occur ....
Metates have flat grinding areas or oval bowls. The trough variety is not known
[Lehmer 1948:72].

The atlatl was in use, but apparently not the bow and arrow or ceramics,
except in the very latest adaptations.
There are at least two excavated Hueco phase sites in the southern
Guadalupes. Williams Cave (or Indian Cave) (41CU16), was excavated by
Mary Youngman Ayer in the 1930s under the aegis of E.B. Howard.
Although the site was quite deep, Ayer did not indicate whether it was
stratified or even dug in arbitrary levels. She recovered an unspecified number
of manos--both convex and wedge shaped--fiat metates, scrapers, sotoldigging sticks, shafts and foreshafts (presumably ofatlatl darts), at least three
varieties of sandals, and a wide variety of other basketry and cordage. Under
plant remains she reported "primitive flint corn, ears 1½-3 inches long,
average 12 rows of kernels, mesquite beans, pifion cones, prickly pears, sotol
seeds, bundles of grass (use problematical)" (Ayer 1936:604).
The fauna from the cave consisted of a variety of small rodents, three
species of deer (including white-tailed deer), wapati, pronghorn antelope,
bobcat, cougar, grizzly bear, and gray fox. A yellow-haired porcupine was
noted, and Ayer commented that its natural habitat was in the Transition or
Canadian zone. Extinct faunal remains from the cave included direwolf,
horse, bighorn sheep, and ground sloth. All of the extinct faunal materials
were recovered between 1 and 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet) below the surface (Ayer
1936:604-617). With the exception of these faunal remains, Ayer does not
furnish provenience for any of the faunal or artifactual materials excavated.
Three burials were excavated from the cave, a basket burial of two
children and an adult, a cradle burial, and a bag burial of an adult. Ayer
reports that the multiple burial was at a depth of 46 cm (18 in.) in the rear of
the cave, and the cradle burial was near the innermost wall; no mention was
made of the location and depth of the third burial. No evidence of occupation
was found more than 1 meter (3 ft.) below the undisturbed surface (Ayer
1936:600-601).
The artifact inventory, nature of the burials, and lack of pottery
corresponded to Sayle’s Hueco Cave Dweller culture (Ayer 1936:604). Since
there were no tabulations of artifact frequencies, faunal materials, or
provenience, it is difficult to assess the significance of the site. Clearly, a
hunting and gathering subsistence is indicated, probably with emphasis on
gathering, since most of the faunal remains represent only one individual per
species. Unfortunately, we have no idea how many milling stones or sotol
digging sticks were recovered; this data might have given us a better
indication of the subsistence emphasis. There is a suggestion of stratigraphic
separation of the cultural materials and the Pleistocene fauna, appearing to
rule out a late Paleo-Indian or early Archaic occupation. No dates have been
suggested for this site, but it is conceivable that some of the organic cultural
materials could be used for radiocarbon analysis.
Pratt Cave is on the northeast edge of the park, on the south side of
McKittrick Canyon. In 1961 a cache of artifacts was discovered in the cave,
and in 1965 excavations were initiated under the direction of Albert
Schroeder (Katz and Katz 1974:7). The results of the archeological investigations have recently been published (Schroeder 1983), and the pollen
analysis (Bryant 1983) and faunal analysis (Lundelius 1979) are available.

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

Two radiocarbon dates of perishables in the cache were: TX-1021--wood
slab, 1420 _+ 60 B.P. (ca. A.D. 530); and TX-1022--basketry, 1840,2-_ 60 B.P.
(ca. A.D. 110) (Valastro et al. 1979:262). These dates indicate that the cache is
probably late Hueco.
In addition to the excavations at Pratt Cave described above, H.P. Mera
investigated 13 sites in the Guadalupes (Mera 1938). Originally he had
planned to work only in caves because they were being destroyed at an
alarming rate by relic collectors, but he decided to include some open
campsites as well. Although his report contains a wealth of information, it
includes neither descriptions of the excavation techniques nor the provenience
of the materials recovered, except by site. It is apparent that many of the sites
yielded artifacts from the Archaic stage, as well as some evidence of NeoAmerican occupations. In High Cave, now known as Higher Sloth Cave
(Katz and Katz 1974:6), Mera excavated a midden ring, and from this and
other excavations in the cave he recovered mescal quids, 46 sandals, a section
of net, and a large hardwood projectile point, but no ceramics (Mera 1938:3435). It is quite possible that this site may date to the Archaic.
Further documentation of Archaic occupations in the southern Guadalupes comes from the recent work of Paul and Suzanna Katz. In their
survey of the park subsequent to the TAS survey, they compared many of
their projectile points to those in a typology established by LeRoy Johnson
(1967). They identified Johnson’s C-, D-, and E-group points among ones
they recovered from lithic and ceramic-and-lithic scatter sites in the
Guadalupes. Johnson’s chronology, which the Katzes tentatively adopted,
dates these projectile points from 6000 B.C. to A.D. 1. The Transitional
period, according to Johnson’s scheme, dates from A.D. 1 to A.D. 800 and is
represented by H- and I-group points. Transitional period sites are also
characterized by brown ware ceramics (presumably Jornada Brown, E1 Paso
Brown, and South-Pecos Brown, all of which are found in the park). The
Texas Tech survey conducted by the Katzes, like the TAS survey, dealt only
with surface collections; therefore, assignment of Archaic stage dates to their
sites is by typological comparison only.
Although Archaic manifestations in the southern Guadalupes have been
studied more thoroughly than have any other stages, our understanding of the
Archaic is still rudimentary. The existence in the mountains of several caves
with Archaic components, as well as many Archaic style points in open sites,
indicates a substantial occupation during the Archaic, but there are no clear
associations of Archaic materials with extinct fauna, leaving an early Archaic
occupation an open question. The single set of radiocarbon dates for the
southern Guadalupes confirms a late Archaic presence. The available floral
and faunal inventories from the dry caves and shelters indicate that gathering
was more important than hunting. It is apparent that there was some variety
of generalized Archaic hunter-gatherer culture in the region. Typologically it
seems to resemble the Hueco phase most closely.
Neo-A merlcan Sites
The Neo-American stage is represented in Trans-Pecos Texas by the
Jornada branch of the Mogollon, defined by Donald H. Lehmer (1948). Since

16

Texas Archeological Society

ceramics are an integral part of the Jornada inventory, it has been possible to
define rather precisely the spatial and temporal limits of the various phases of
the Jornada branch. Lehmer was able to date three phases on the basis of a
series of Jornada ceramics and the association with them of various
previously dated intrusive wares. Below is a brief description of sites in the
Guadalupes and adjacent regions that have Jornada branch materials.
Lehmer believes that the Neo-American stage in the Trans-Pecos
developed out of a blending of the Hueco culture with influences from the
Mogollon pueblos of San Maricial. Since the subsistence pattern already
focused on plant gathering, the shift to plant food production was not a
drastic change. According to Lehmer (1948:73), "the transition from the
earlier gathering economy to a horticultural one was apparently gradual and
without marked disturbing effect on the rest of the pattern." The large
projectile points of the Hueco continued to be used in the early phases of the
Neo-American, especially in the more marginal (i.e., mountainous) areas
(Lehmer 1948:38).
Lehmer (1948) defines the Jornada branch of the Mogollon as having
northern and southern variants, each subdivided into three phases. The
phases of the southern variant (Mesilla, Dona Ana, and E1 Paso), which are
more pertinent to the Guadalupe Mountains, will be discussed here.
Briefly, the Mesilla phase lasted from about A.D. 900 to 1000. Both
rectangular and circular pithouses were used during this time, and ceramics
were introduced into the region, apparently derived from Alma Plain
(Lehmer 1948:74). E1 Paso Brown is the only ceramic type associated with the
Mesilla phase. The subsistence base included some agriculture--probably
maize and squash--but hunting and gathering continued to play a significant
role (Lehmer 1948:75-78).
The Dona Ana phase (A.D. 1000-1200) is a transitional phase between
the Mesilla and E1 Paso phases. The use of pithouses continued, but Pueblostyle houses also appeared. E1 Paso Polychrome was added to the E1 Paso
Brown warealready in use. There was probably no significant change in the
subsistence pattern (Lehmer 1948:78-80).
The E1 Paso phase (A.D. 1200-1400) had the most sophisticated
development of the Jornada branch. The people lived in pueblos that were
often arranged either in simple rows or in squares with interior plazas. Both E1
Paso Brown and E1 Paso Polychrome ceramics continued to be used,
although the brown wares declined in relative frequency. Also at this time,
intrusive potteries, most commonly Chupadero Black on White, became
more frequent than at any other time. By this time agriculture had become
more important, displacing hunting (Lehmer 1948:30-84).
There are several reported Neo-American sites in the Guadalupe
Mountains. Mera (1938) discovered two caves, Goat Cave and Wild Horse
Cave, with Neo-American components. In Goat Cave he found a burial, a
great deal of vegetable matter, wooden projectile points, dart foreshafts, cane
shafts, rabbit sticks (small hardwood sticks presumably used to kill rabbits), a
fragment of rabbit-skin robe, and E1 Paso Polychrome and Chupadero Black
on White pottery. His report does not indicate whether all of the materials
from the cave came from the same archeological component, or whether they

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

17

came from stratified deposits. At Wild Horse Cave, Mera found bits of
weaving, a scraper, a knife, and 10 potsherds (nine Jornada Brown and a
single sherd of Chupadero Black on White), and a midden circle was close by.
Mera also commented that in all of the caves where he found vegetable
material there were many mescal quids and occasional remains of opuntia
fruits (tunas), but he found no mesqite beans or corn.
Another cave in the park with a Neo-American component is Hermit’s
Cave, excavated by Edwin Ferdon, Jr. (1946). The site had three levels, of
which only the uppermost had ceramics. The pottery consisted of Chupadero
Black on White, Lincoln Black on Red, and Classic Pueblo, or Pueblo III.
Ferdon noted that changes in projectile point types indicated a shift from the
use of atlatls in the lower levels to bows and arrows in the upper level. He did
not find evidence of agriculture (Ferdon 1946:24-28). The ceramics at the site
suggest a date of about A.D. 1350 (Breternitz 1966:72, 82).
About 160 km (100 miles) northeast of the park is the Merchant site, an
open site excavated by the Lea County Archeological Society (LCAS) (Leslie
1965). The site was on the edge of a ridge overlooking a dry lake bed. Fourteen
permanent structures were found there, including two pitrooms and twelve
surface houses. Corely and Leslie report that the walls of the pitrooms were
independent of the pit sides (Lehmer 1948:128). However, Collins suggests
that they were indeed semisubterranean pithouses. The surface structures
were made of caliche stones mortared with clay. An impressive number of
projectile points--some 7,000--were recovered from the site (Leslie 1965:28).
A few were Archaic dart points, but most were small arrow points. More than
7,000 sherds were recovered, 98 percent of which were made locally; the other
2 percent were intrusive decorated wares. On the basis of the intrusive types,
an occupation date of about A.D. 1400 was established (Leslie 1965:29). The
subsistence base seems to have been hunting, as "many large and small animal
and fowl bones appeared in most all trash and refuse" (Leslie 1965:28). No
evidence of agriculture was found, and the investigators suggested that
acorns, which were found in small quantities at the site, were substituted for
maize in the diet.
The E1 Paso Archaeological Society has reported on the excavation of a
single-room house at the Hot Well site (Shultz 1966) in the Hueco Bolson west
of the park. The excavators recovered 388 potsherds from the structure, 95
percent of which were local E1 Paso Polychrome. The identifiable intrusives
from the house were Chupadero Black on White and Lincoln Black on Red.
The overlap of the approximate time spans of the wares (Breternitz 1966:72,
74, 82) suggests an occupation date of about A.D. 1350. Stone artifacts were
rare at this site; they consisted of a minor amount ofchippage, one limestone
chopper or hoe, and a hammerstone or anvil. The Hot Well site was an open
site with little potential for the preservation of perishables, so no vegetable
materials were recovered. No positive evidence for the subsistence base was
found, but cultigens were probably a significant factor in the diet.
The nature of the Neo-American occupation of the southern Guadalupes
is still poorly known. We know little more than that the region was indeed
occupied during that time period. Data on subsistence orientation and
possible cultural affinities to nearby regions are totally lacking.

Historic A ccounts
The brief Historic stage in the Guadalupes was the final episode of
aboriginal occupation. Our knowledge of this era is derived not so much from
the study of historic sites as from the study of historic documents, although
there are few ethnohistoric accounts concerning residents of the southern
Guadalupes (Hammond and Rey 1966). None of the early Spanish expeditions
actually entered the mountains; rather, they passed nearby (Figure 5).
Nowhere in the historic documents is there any report of agriculture in or near
the Guadalupe Mountains. The groups mentioned in the ethnohistories of the
area seemed intent upon hunting and gathering, supplementing their needs
and wants by trade or raiding. It is the raiding that eventually brought about
the final defeat and subjugation of the last Indian residents of the Guadalupes.
At the time of contact with the Spanish, the Trans-Pecos region was an
area of great cultural diversity, with representatives of three different cultural
adaptations existing in rather close proximity. The Cabris Indians, including
the Rayas and Conchos, were representative of the hunter-gatherers who
occupied the northeastern region of Texas. They were organized in fairly
small bands and apparently subsisted on small game and wild plants. Pueblo
influence was manifested in the form of the sedentary villages in the La Junta
area, which were described by the Spaniards as pueblos. These people, such as
the Patarabueye, cultivated large amounts of maize, beans, and squashes.
There were Plains Indians collectively identified as Jumanas or Jumanos.
They too were hunter-gatherers, but they focused on large game--bison, deer,
and antelope. There was certainly contact between these groups, and some
northeastern Mexicans were cultivating a few crops, apparently diffused
south from the Pueblo region. The settled Patarabueyes carried on a lively
intercourse with the Jumanos and obtained from them bison hides and sturdy
Plains bows. In return the Jumanos probably received corn, other foods, and
cotton cloth.
Given the environmental and geographical situation of the Guadalupe
Mountains, it is likely that all three life-sty!es--simple hunter-gatherer,
Plains hunter-gatherer, and sedentary agriculturalist--played roles in the
cultural history of the region.
During the seventeenth century, the Apachean groups became established
in this area and put heavy pressure on the southernmost Pueblo towns.
During this time groups like the Mansos, Sumas, and Jumanos faded from
the records, absorbed or replaced by the Apaches (Schroeder 1974). From
this time until their final subjugation late in the 19th century, Apachean
groups under a variety of names--Siete Rios, Natage, and Mescalero
(Schroeder 1974)--inhabited the mountainous areas between the Pecos River
and the Rio Grande, with the Sacramento and Guadalupe Mountains as their
heartland. They raided the Spanish and Anglos for livestock and captives
during this period. Unfortunately, most accounts of this later period are also
meager, limited to short descriptions of military actions taken against the
Apachean groups. When these groups were expelled in the nineteenth
century, more than I0,000 years of aboriginal occupation in the southern
Guadalupe Mountains was abruptly ended.

Although ethnohistorical accounts are limited, the documents that are
available do provide information on the life-styles practiced in the area. The
diversity of life-styles observed indicates that the southern Guadalupes were
an area of cultural transition.

THE DATA BASE
Presented here are descriptions of the survey methodology of the TAS,
the kinds of data collected by the survey, and a discussion of the inherent
limitations of the data. Following this are descriptions of the artifact
categories that were established and used for the analysis, with particular
attention to the projectile points, since they constitute the bulk of the
culturally and temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered. The flake forms are
described, and the process used to define and select them is explained.
The archeological survey conducted by the TAS in 1970 gathered data
with the objective of providing solutions to two problems. The first was to
establish a relative chronology and to outline the culture history of the park
area; the second was to ascertain, if possible, the distribution of various
archeological materials with respect to the ecological zones in the park
(Shafer 1971:11). The survey focused on the southern and western parts of the
park. National Park Service officials requested that the survey be initiated
there because they expected these areas to suffer the greatest immediate
impact from development and use of the park (Roger Reich, National Park
Service, personal communication).
The survey was carried out by about 200 members of the TAS consisting
of school children, high school and college students, graduate students in
anthropology, and avocational archeologists. Participants in the survey were
organized into crews, each under the supervision of a crew chief who had had
previous training or experience in archeological field work. The crews
alternated a day in the field with a day in camp, cleaning, sorting, and
cataloging the materials collected on the previous day.
The surveying was done on foot, and about 10 percent (19 sq km, or 12
square miles) of the park was covered. The survey methodology was designed
to ensure recovery of a representative sample of materials from each site
visited.
Collecting techniques allowed for adequate artifact samples from most sites.
Crews were discouraged from wandering about the sites looking only for
projectile points and pottery. Rather, intensive collection from one or more
areas of the site was encouraged with an emphasis on getting a sample of all
kinds of artifacts [Shafer 1971:16].

The survey directors attempted to standardize the collecting techniques
and to a great extent, but not entirely, they were successful. Some site notes
were accompanied by detailed maps of collecting loci, but others gave only
the site locations. For example, one site (41CU31) was surveyed by means of a
controlled surface collection, a deviation from the standard methodology.
Although the crew chiefs occasionally deviated from the prescribed survey
approach in order to adapt to the particular conditions at various sites, the

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

21

actual collection of samples from the sites was generally adequate and
comparable from site to site. In most cases there is reasonable assurance that a
representative collection of material was taken and the rest left in place for
further work. A total of 146 sites were surveyed, including two historic sites.
(A description of each is included in Boisvert 1980:Appendix 2.)
Before artifacts were analyzed, they were sorted into typological
categories. The organization and construction of a typology must be
appropriate to the purposes for which it is intended. One eminent archeologist
has stated that "the major goal of classification in most present-day
archaeological studies is to use type as a measurement of culture history in
time and space" (Ford 1949:44), but an equally eminent one subscribes to
other views:
The artifact type is here viewed as a group of artifacts exhibiting a consistent
assemblage of attributes whose combined properties give a characteristic
pattern. This implies that, even within a context of quite similar artifacts,
classification into types is a process of discovery of combinations of attributes
favored by the makers of the artifacts, not an arbitrary procedure of the
classifier [ Spaulding 1953:305].

This report encompasses both kinds of problems, i.e., descriptions of
cultural-historical phenomena and the elucidation of behavioral patterns. To
this end the artifact typology is a construct of the author, whose avowed goal
was to create the most meaningful and succinct means of describing and
defining the artifacts found by the TAS survey. Once categorizing was
accomplished, the artifacts were analyzed by various means in order to
provide solutions to the stated problems.
The artifacts were classified primarily on a morphological basis, by
dividing and subdividing them into increasingly smaller and less heterogeneous
groups. The criteria for making these divisions were largely subjective, but in
general follow the conventional typological procedures of American archeology. The objective was to arrive at artifact categories defined by
morphological attributes, without reference to functional qualities. In several
cases, however, functional names were used when morphological attributes
coincided with artifact categories such as drills, projectile points, and
chopping tools, to which functional significance is attached by most
American archeologists. The artifact categories used to describe the survey
collection from the park are (1) ground and pecked stone; (2) chipped stone,
which is subdivided into the basic categories, cores, flakes, unifaces, and
bifaces; and (3) miscellaneous artifacts. Special typological consideration has
been given to the projectile points (26 types) and flakes (29 attribute
combinations or types). (Boisvert 1980:Appendix 2 contains a site-by-site
distribution of materials recovered by the survey.)
Ground and Pecked Stone
Battered Stone
These stones, primarily chert and quartzite, have one or more battered
areas that indicate, from placement and quality, that the battering was not

22

Texas Archeological Society

naturally derived. The stones have functioned as hammerstones, pounders, or
anvils for stoneworking, for plant or pigment processing, or for some other
process.
Flat Manos

Flat manos show evidence on one or both planar surfaces of use as
grinding stones. All complete specimens in the collection can be held and used
with one hand, although a few could have been used with two hands. Their
size and shape are identical to artifacts normally termed manos in the
Southwest.
Convex Mano$

The convex manos are similar to the flat manos, except that the ground
surfaces are distinctively convex.
Metates

Metates are slablike stones that have flat or slightly concave ground
surfaces. They are thinner than manos and have broad grinding areas that
cover most of their surface areas. No complete metates were recovered by the
survey, but large metate fragments were collected. As with the manos, the
term by which they are most commonly recognized in the Southwest has been
adopted for use in this study.
Chipped Stone
A morphous Cores
Amorphous cores are pieces of chippable stone from which flakes have
been removed in seemingly random patterns. They tend to be globular, and
apparently they have not been specifically shaped for use as tools or for the
production of specialized flakes.
Single Platform Cores
Single platform cores are cores with a number of flakes removed from a
single surface or facet. They are prismatic or cone shaped, and at least some
are the sources of blades (flakes with prismatic cross section and parallel
sides, which are at least twice as long as they are wide).
Flakes
Flakes are the by-product of chipped stone tool manufacture and are
collectively termed chippage. Crabtree’s succinct definition is followed in this
report: "Any piece of stone removed from a larger mass by the application of
force--either intentional, accidental or by nature. A portion of isotropic
material having a platform and bulb of force at the proximal end (end at
which the force was applied)" (Crabtree 1972:64). Included in this category
are both fragmentary and complete flakes.
Core Fragments
Core fragments are small, angular pieces of stone similar to flakes, but
whose identifying characteristics, platforms and bulbs of force, are missing.

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

23

They tend to be larger and, especially, thicker than most flakes, but they are
too small to be used as cores. They are artifacts that show evidence of
modification by man but that cannot be classed as flakes, cores, or
implements. It is probable that they are the remains of shattered cores.
Utilized Flakes
Utilized flakes are flakes modified by use and exhibiting polish, use
retouch, or striations on one or more edges. All artifacts identified as utilized
flakes in this study were examined under a binocular microscope before being
so classified.
Unifaces

Unifaces are flakes or cores that have a planar surface; they have been
modified by the removal of a series of flakes at one or more places along the
edge of one surface only. A wide variety of shapes can result from such
unifacial flaking; some unifaces may have been purposely shaped for specific
uses. Listed below are the types of unifaces, defined on the basis of
morphology.
Type I unifaees are semicircular, with trimming only along the curbed
edges.
Type H unifaees have a semicircular notch on an edge. The notch is
produced by unifacial flaking, and parts of the remaining edge may or may
not be flaked as well. Artifacts of this type have been called spokeshaves.
Type IIIa unifaees are flaked only along the short axis of the parent flake
or core, the worked edge of which is incurvate.
Type IIIb unifaees are flaked only along the short axis of the parent flake
or core, the worked edge of which is straight.
Type IIIe unifaees are flaked only along the short axis of the parent flake
or core, the worked edge of which is excurvate.
Type IVa unifaees are flaked only along the long axis of the parent flake
or core, the worked edge of which is incurvate.
Type IVb unifaees are flaked only along the long axis of the parent flake
or core, the worked edge of which is straight.
Type IVe unifaees are flaked only along the long axis of the parent flake
or core, the worked edge of which is excurvate.
Type V unifaees are artifacts on which the flaking is not restricted to a
particular long or short axis, nor is the shape of the flaked edge readily
classifiable as being straight or curved. They are best described as unshaped
(amorphous) unifaces.
Type VI unifaees are flakes with minute unifacial retouch along one or
more edges. The flake scars are rarely more than 2 mm long. Such flaking
could result from use as an implement (intentional retouch) or from
unintentional retouch prehistorically (ground wear) or during contemporary
times (bag retouch).
Unifaeefragments are the broken parts of any of the unifaces described
above. Their typically small size, in addition to their fragmentary nature,
precludes further classification.

24

Texas Archeological Society

Bifaces
Biface-Uniface Composites
Biface-uniface composite artifacts are any flakes or cores with both
unifacially and bifacially flaked edges.
Bifa ces
Bifaces are flakes or cores that have been flaked along one or more edges
by blows originating from opposing directions, resulting in edges that are
formed by the intersection of two planes or surfaces, both bearing negative
flake scars.
Utihafted Bifaces
Unhafted bifaces are bifaces with no evidence of modification for the
attachment of handles or shafts. This does not necessarily mean that none of
these artifacts were ever hafted, but only that they lack hafting modifications.
Four specimens that very closely resemble recognized projectile point types
are not included in this part of the typology, but are listed with the projectile
points.
Marginal bifaces are flakes with retouch similar to Type VI unifaces,
except that the retouch is bifacial. Marginal bifaces typically have limited
areas of small, irregular bifacial retouch.
Single-edge heavily retouched bifaces are cores or large flakes that have
been flaked by percussion along only one edge, thus producing a single crude
sinuous edge.
Chopping tools are similar to the single-edge heavily retouched bifaces
described above except that they are made exclusively on large pebbles, and
the flaked edges are made by removing broader, somewhat flatter flakes. The
term chopping tools has been adopted because of the similarity between these
artifacts and those Old World artifacts called chopping tools (see Bordes
1968:242, 243).
Ovate bifaces are bifacial implements, oval or slightly rectangular, with
well-rounded corners, biconvex in cross section. The artifacts are flaked all
the way around, generally a result of soft hammer percussion, with some
secondary retouch.
Tabular bifaces (Figure 6), made from naturally tabular material, have
percussion-flaked edges. They are usually shaped like right triangles with the
longest sides usually excurvate and the shorter sides straight and untrimmed.
They are relatively large artifacts, measuring from 76 to 221 mm in length,
from 54 to 116 mm in width, and from 8 to 20 mm in thickness. All of the
specimens collected by the survey were of limestone.
Planoconvex bifaces are defined on the basis of their cross sections,
which, as the name indicates, are planoconvex. Most specimens resemble
Type IIIc and IVc unifaces and may in fact be rejuvenated versions of the
same.
Preforms, or blanks, are unfinished bifacially worked artifacts that have
been subjected to primary trimming and shaping but have not yet received the
final shaping and such finishing touches as modifications for hafting. They

are usually oval or roughly triangular in outline, with relatively thick cross
sections. Percussion flaking is evident on the artifacts, but pressure flaking is
not.
Snap fragment bifaces are fragments of bifaces for which the specific
cause of breakage could not be determined. All biface fragments except those
with hafting modifications fall into this category; it includes tips, large edge
sections, midsections, and squared or rounded bases.
Transverse fractured bifaces are similar to the snap fragment bifaces
described above, except that the breakage could be related to the manufacturing process. A bulb of percussion, either positive or negative, and radial
shatter lines can be seen originating at one of the bifacial edges and continuing
across the exposed transverse section of the biface. The particular location of
the break is usually associated with other flaking problems such as knots or
collapsed edges from unsuccessful shaping.
Hafted Bifaces
All hafted bifaces except drills are considered projectile points. This
interpretation is made with the realization that some of the artifacts may have
been used as knives, but since many have been found in dry caves or
rockshelters hafted to projectile shafts or foreshafts, in most cases their

identification as projectile points is probably accurate. The types of projectile
points recovered by the survey are described below. Comparisons with
previously defined types are made and cultural-temporal affiliations are
indicated when possible (Figure 7). Table 1 shows the distribution of the
points by site; Table 2 shows the range of metric attributes.
Projectile Points
Type 1--Livermore points (Figure 8, A-D); narrow, spikelike blades
with wide shoulders that are more than double the blade width; expanded
stems, and rounded bases that may be as wide as the shoulders; made from
thin flakes that often retain the original curvature of the flake. They conform
well to the type description provided by Suhm and Jelks (1962:279-280),
except that in some cases the bases of the points in the survey collection are
wider.

*One specimen only.
**Measurement taken on largest of fragmentary specimens.
~Measurement estimated from fragmentary specimen.

Type 2--Perdiz points (Figure 8, E, F); triangular blades with nearly
straight sides; shoulders are straight, making the blade shape very nearly an
equilateral triangle; stems are slightly contracted, and bases are rounded.
Compared to the shoulders, the stems are fairly narrow, about one-third of
the total width.
Type 3--Thin, triangular blades, nearly twice as long as they are wide
(Figure 8, G, H); thin and finely serrated edges; shoulders are barbed
asymmetrically; stems are parallel sided, with slightly rounded bases. These
points resemble Bonham points (Suhm and Jelks 1962:267-268), except that
stems are not as straight sided and straight based as the type specimens.
Type 4--Small points (Figure 9, A, B), somewhat crudely made
compared to other points of similar size in the survey collection; thick relative
to their length and width; triangular blades with asymmetrically barbed
shoulders; expanded stems; excurvate bases.

Boisvert--Guadalupe Mountains

29

Type 5--Triangular blades, as long as they are wide (Figure 9, C-E);
blade edges are excurvate or slightly recurvate; stems are broad, almost as
wide as the shoulders; expanded stems and slightly barbed shoulders formed
by shallow corner notching; basal edges are excurvate; closely resemble Ellis
points (Suhm and Jelks 1962:187-188), but are consistently shorter.
Type 6--Triangular blades, slightly longer than they are wide (Figure 9,
F,G); blade edges are excurvate; shoulders taper down into the stems, which
are relatively broad, over half the width of the point, and have rounded bases.
Type 7--Fairly large (the tips are missing from all specimens) with
slightly asymmetrical shoulders (Figure 10, A-C); parallel-sided stems with
incurvate bases; resemble Darls (Suhm and Jelks 1962:179-180), but, since all
specimens are fragmentary, they are not confidently identified as such.
Type 8--Medium-to-large points with triangular bases nearly as wide as
they are long (Figure 10, D-F); blade edges are straight to slightly excurvate
and may be slightly serrated; shoulders are usually barbed, but in some cases
are rounded yet prominent; stems are expanded and make up about onefourth of total length. They are also broad, nearly three-fourths of the width
at the shoulder; bases are excurvate. Both Type 8 and Type 9, described
below, are identical to some of the Group H points in Johnson’s typology
(1967). Katz and Katz (1974) use Johnson’s typology and illustrate points of
this type that were recovered in the park during their survey for Texas Tech
University.
Type 9--Similar to Type 8 points except that the shoulders are not
usually barbed, although they are quite prominent (Figure 10, G-J); blade
forms are similar, but serrations are less common; stems are expanded and
bases are straight, rather than excurvate.
Type 10--Larger than most other points recovered in the survey (Figure
11, A-D); triangular blades with straight or nearly straight edges; bases have
been notched, producing straight or nearly straight stems, and long barbs are
either curved or straight. Type 10 corresponds to the Shumla as defined by
Suhm and Jelks (1962:247-248). Dibble (1967:35) has subdivided the type on
the basis of the shape of the barbs; at Arenosa Shelter the straight-barbed
Shumla-like points occur earlier in the stratigraphic sequence than do the
curved-barbed Shumlas. Figure 11 C resembles the Shumla-like variety.
Type//--Elongated blades as much as twice the width (Figure 11, E-G);
blade edges are excurvate; shoulders are rounded; stems are rounded and
make up about one-fourth of the total length.
Type 12--One of the largest points in the assemblage (Figure 11, H-K);
stems are long (13 to 17 mm) and stem sides are incurvate with excurvate
bases; shoulders are rounded or slightly barbed; blade edges near the
shoulders are often triangular or nearly parallel. There are no complete
specimens in the collection.
Type 13--Basal fragments only (Figure 12, A-C); blade edges are
serrated and essentially straight where observable; points are broadly side
notched, resulting in moderately barbed or rounded shoulders; stems are
expanded, with rounded corners that are as wide as the maximum width of
the shoulders; bases are slightly incurvate.

Type 14--Blade outlines are triangular with rather acute tips (Figure 12,
D, E); bases are weakly side notched to straight, with rounded shoulders and
expanded stems; somewhat crudely flaked compared to the rest of the
collection.
Type 15--Large, broad, triangular points (Figure 12, F-H) with
excurvate sides; corners have been removed, forming very short, broad stems
with straight or slightly contracting sides and straight bases. All of the points
in this type are made of quartzite.
Type 16--Ensor points (Figure 13, A-D); lateral notches, shoulder
forms, and blade outlines conform to the type description provided by Suhm
and Jelks 1962:189, 190).
Type 17--Relatively thin, small points (Figure 13, E-G); recurvate blade
outlines may be the result of some reworking; shoulders are straight or
barbed; both stems and bases are straight or slightly excurvate. The points are
made on thin flakes, and the original curvature of the flake is still evident on
some specimens.
Type 18--A single point (Figure 14, A) closely resembling the Meserve
point (Suhm and Jelks 1962; 217,218); rather small (28.7 mm long, 17.1 mm
wide at the base, and as much as 4.7 mm thick at the midsection); serrated
triangular blade; base is broader than the blade at its widest part; sides are
slightly incurvate; base too is incurvate, having been produced by short
flakes--but not fluting flakes--running parallel to the long axis of the point;
point has secondary retouch, which enhances the incurvate nature of the base;
point is ground at the sides and bottom of the base. It is an exceptionally small
example of a Meserve point.
Type 19--A single point (Figure 14, F) that has similarities with both
Maud and Talco (Suhm and Jelks 1962:281,282, 289-293) points; tip of point
is broken and blade outline was almost surely recurvate, making it more like
Talco; length of the broken point is 2 cm, and the estimated length of the
complete point is 3 or 4 mm longer; base is slightly flared and incurvate. Since
this point is fragmentary, it is difficult to assess its similarity to the established
point types; however, it is likely a variant of either the Talco or the Maud type,
both of which have similar temporal and spatial ranges.
Type 20--Small, fairly well-made point (Figure 14, E) closely resembling
the Scallorn point (Suhm and Jelks 1962:285-286); made from a flake; blade
edges are essentially straight and evenly pressure flaked; blade edges extend to
the notches to form slight barbs. The corners of the base have been broken,
making an assessment of the hafting morphology difficult; however, it
appears to have been diagonally notched, producing an expanded stem.
Type 21--Closely resembles the Fresno point (Figure 14, D) (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:273-274); slightly more than 2 cm long and may have measured 1.5
cm in width (exact width cannot be determined because one corner is broken);
point was made from a flake and has a smooth interior surface that has been
modified by a series of small, relatively crude retouch flakes; opposite surface
of point has several small retouch flakes and has evidence that several flakes
were removed from the core prior to the removal of the flake from which the
point was made; base is essentially straight, with a series of small nibbling

38

Texas Archeological Society

flakes along its margin (these flakes could have been produced quite easily by
superficial grinding or rasping with an abrader); point is planoconvex in cross
section.
Type 22--Triangular blade with straight sides, side-notched with a short,
relatively wide, straight stem; base is incurvate and slightly thinned on one
face; point is biconvex in cross section, finely pressure flaked on both
surfaces, and made from a mottled, honey-colored, jasperlike (probably
nonlocal) material (Figure 14, C); assigned to the Harrell type (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:275-276); length is estimated at 2.2 cm, well within the Harrell
range, and the width at the base is 1.5 era; maximum thickness is 0.4 cm.
Type 23--Toyah, the only example of a very late prehistoric, possibly
protohistoric, point (Suhm and Jelks 1962:289-290); small (Figure 14, B),
basically triangular, with excurvate blade edges; point is both side and basal
notched, so the hafting area resembles two constricted lobes protruding from
the blade area; point is biconvex and finely pressure flaked.
Type 24--Conforms to the description of the Young point (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:295-296); essentially triangular with excurvate blade outline and
slightly incurvate base (Figure 15, B); made from a flake of banded cherty
limestone; multifaceted striking platform is plainly visible on one corner of
the point, with a moderate lip overhanging the bulb; nearly half of exterior
part of point is covered by flake scars made prior to removal of the flake from
the core; rest of chipping is light retouch, apparently for shaping point. This
point bears a remarkable resemblance to the specimen pictured in Suhm and
Jelks (1962:Plate 148 H).
Type 25--Two bifaces (Figure 15, C, D) resemble the Catan point (Suhm
and Jelks 1962:175-176), which lacks specific hafting modifications; triangular
(teardrop shaped), with excurvate blade edges and rounded bases.
Type 26--Biface (Figure 15, A) resembling a Tortugas point (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:294-295); triangular bordering on pentagonal, as the lower blade
edges are nearly parallel; one edge roughly excurvate; the other has a slight
angle; one face fairly flat and may retain part of unmodified interior face of a
large flake; opposite side beveled, with many flake scars; made from a very
grainy purple quartzite, which accounts for its rather crude outline and
surface treatment; straight base with no evidence of grinding.
Projectile Point Fragments
As the name implies, these are the pieces of broken projectile points.
Usually some part of the hafting area is identifiable, but in most cases there is
no possibility of identifying the point type (Figure 13, H-J).
Drills

These artifacts are hafted bifaces with slender spikelike blades. In cross
section the blades are either rhomboidal or nearly circular. The bases are
generally broad, occasionally shouldered, and typically resemble straightstemmed or expanding-stemmed projectile points. In some cases they may
have been recycled from broken projectile points. The functional term drill
has been adopted for use in this typology, since these forms are inevitably
identified as drills or perforators in the literature of North American
archeology.

Miscellaneous Artifacts

Some of the artifacts and items collected by the TAS survey do not fit
into the lithic artifact typology described above; they are presented here, but
they have not been included in the computer-assisted analyses because they
are dubious artifacts (i.e., there is some doubt that they were man made) or
are so unique in shape, function, or occurrence that no meaningful
comparisons could be made. Table 3 shows the distribution of these artifacts,
which are described below.
Parallel-sided Bifaces
Parallel-sided bifaces are essentially pentagonal, relatively long and
.narrow, with essentially parallel sides and biconvex cross sections. This
artifact type and the two directly below are similar in some respects to some
projectile points; however, no satisfactory comparisons could be made
between any of these specimens and point types described in the archeological
literature.
Triangular Rounded-base Bifaces
Triangular rounded-base bifaces are biconvex in cross section, with
excurvate edges, the bases being defined as the shortest of the three edges.
Triangular Straight-base Bifaces
Triangular straight-base bifaces are similar to the rounded-base bifaces,
differing in that the shortest edges are straight rather than rounded or
excurvate.
A morphous Bifaces
Amorphous bifaces constitute a troublesome category. Their crude,
irregular shapes defy description or explanation. Some specimens could be
abandoned cores, aborted bifacial tools, or even finished implements whose
form and function could not be surmised. Rather than adding these artifacts
to one of the existing categories, it was decided to leave them out of the
analysis altogether.
Hematite
Four specimens of hematite were collected in the survey. Two are ground
and gouged and were possibly a source of pigment.
Burins
In the collection are two burins, one from CU19 and one from CU25,
both made on broken bifaces. The working edges of the burins were made by
removing flakes from the broken surfaces parallel to the bifacial edges.
Hailed Scraper
This scraper was probably made from a broken projectile point. The
scraping edge was made by beveling the fracture plane. The hafting area
consists of a straight stem with parallel sides and a slightly excurvate base.

Beveled Knives

Two bifaces have been identified as alternately beveled knives. The
pointed ends of the bifaces were produced by flaking along one edge of each
side to produce a bevel on each edge. One knife is made from a local gray
quartzite and measures 78 mm long, 29 mm wide, ad 9 mm thick. The other is
made from honey-colored chert and is 64 mm long, 31 mm wide, and 9 mm
thick.
Pick
A long, nearly cylindrical limestone rock in the collection may be a pick.
The removal of several flakes from one end is interpreted as an attempt to
make a working point. However, the flakes were crudely removed and could
also have been fortuitous. The specimen measures 23 cm in length and 5 cm in
diameter.
Large Triangular Biface
This specimenis 6 cm wide at the base, 10 cm long, and approximately 9
mm thick, and is probably a knife. The long edges are excurvate and slightly
asymmetrical; the base is slightly incurvate. The biface is exceptionally well
flaked and is made from local limestone. It is the largest and best-flaked
limestone biface in the collection.
Tabular Limestone Unifaces
These are thin limestone slabs from which series of flakes have been
removed at one or more places on an edge. They may be unifacial versions of
the tabular limestone bifaces also collected on the survey. However, the
unifacial flaking may be fortuitous. These specimens cannot confidently be
identified as artifacts.
Limestone Bar
Another limestone artifact in the collection is from an area designated as
Random Surface #2, in Hudspeth County. The exact location is not specified
in the field notes, but it is presumed to have come from the sand dune area of
the western part of the park, where most of the Hudspeth County sites are
located. It is a narrow, bar-shaped, tabular limestone artifact. It is about 48
cm long, 5.5 cm wide, and 3 cm thick. The corners come to right angles, and
the broadest surface has been ground smooth. It may have functioned as a
kiva bell, for if it were supported by a leather thong and struck with a stick, it
would produce a musical tone. Or, it may be a modern whetstone fashioned
by a contemporary rancher from local material. Since its precise provenience
is not known and there are no known associations of this artifact with
prehistoric materials, theories as to its age and function are speculative.
Engraved Stone
The only work of art recovered by the survey is an engraved limestone
tablet (Figure 16), 7.4 cm long, 3.9 cm wide, 0.9 cm thick, and rectangular in
shape with nearly square corners. A geometric pattern is engraved on one
side. The central part of the design is linear and runs nearly the length of the

Bo&vert--Guadalupe Mountains

tablet. It is a centipedelike design consisting of four zigzag parallel lines
between two series of short lines that are perpendicular to the long axis of the
tablet.
Flake Typology
The typology of the artifacts presented above follows the Ford (1949)
approach and is useful as a means of defining cultural and temporal limits.
However, the analysis of chippage and biface fragments necessitates further
subdivision. A description of these two data categories and a discussion of the
manner in which they have been manipulated follows.
Analysis of the flakes necessitated construction of a typology. The
methods employed here have been taken in large part from the work of M.B.
Collins, who has emphasized the isolation of specific attributes of chipping
debris obtained from replicative experiments and the observation of their
combinations and distribution in archeological assemblages (Collins 1974).
The first step in this flake analysis was to separate the chippage from the
rest of the collection while maintaining site-by-site provenience. Pieces of
nonartifactual material and occasional tools or tool fragments also were
culled. Once the chippage was isolated, observations were made on each
flake. All complete flakes and broken flakes that retained at least part of ther
platform ends were subjected to further analysis. Once the culled flake
fragments (i.e., those parts of flakes without platform ends) were counted and
their material types were recorded, they were given no further attention.
These fragments were not included in the complete analysis for three reasons:
(1) although each flake has only one platform (except in the rarest

44

Texas Archeological Society

circumstances), a single flake may consist of many fragments; (2) statistically,
assuming that there are no significant sampling errors, any information
available from the fragments (such as presence or absence of cortex, flake
thickness, and nature of the bulb of percussion) should have been acquired
already from the sample; and (3) the breakage might have occurred under
circumstances totally unrelated to, and possibly long after, the removal of the
flake from the core.
A total of 2,897 flakes from 103 sites (i.e., all sites with flakes) were
analyzed. Frequency of flakes per site ranged between I and 383. An analysis
using research methods similar to those employed in this report (Goodell
1973) has already been conducted on part of the flake assemblage from
Guadalupe Mountains National Park. However, the results of this work
could not be used in this study for both methodological and practical reasons.
Goodell used some different observational criteria, so it would be difficult to
adjust his findings to the ones based on this system. In addition, the flakes
studiedwere remixed with the unanalyzed flakes,creating a curatorial problem
of immense magnitude. It was more efficient and consistent to analyze all of
the flakes by one process. About a third of the analysis was done by an
experienced student and the remainder was done by the writer. To minimize
bias, the collections were not analyzed in a predetermined order, nor were
specific blocks of sites assigned to either analyst. Many collections from the
larger sites consisted of several lots, and each of these lots was treated
separately. Consequently, the skewing due to differences between observers
or changes in judgment of either of the observers over time was minimized.
Table 4 presents five sets of attribute observations made on each flake:
platform, bulb, body, size, and material. Each set is independent--i.e.,
mutually exclusive in its definitional characteristics--from all other sets. The
Appendix has a description of each of the attributes in the categories.
Once the flakes were analyzed and the attributes for each of the
categories were recorded and coded, the data were keypunched. The
keypunched data were then used as the raw data for further analyses, using an
IBM 370-165/II computer.
The analyais of the flake morphology is a modified version of the one
made by M.B. Collins and uses the IFREQ program written by J. Watts
(Collins 1975). IFREQ is a sorting program that allows the investigator to
identify and count the number of flake types (attribute state combinations) in
a sample. Both expanded and abbreviated versions of the program were used,
but these variations did not change the basic operations; rather, they lent
more flexibility of analysis by permitting greater or lesser numbers of
variables to be sorted and counted.
The number of possible combinations of the 46 attributes observed
formed a five-dimensional matrix of 21,600 cells, each one constituting a
unique combination of attribute states. Of this number, 760 were actually
represented in the collection in frequencies ranging between 1 and 115. The
extremely low frequency of most combinations forced a reduction in the
number of attribates to be analyzed. Therefore, the size and material
categories were deleted from the clustering analysis of the flake morphology,
and the resulting abbreviated set of attributes, which emphasizes flake shape,

was used. The platform, bulb, and body attributes totaled 34 and rendered a
three-dimensional matrix of 720 possible combinations of attributes. Of
these, 147 were present in the collection in frequencies varying from 1 to 254.
This number of flake forms was also considered too great for the purposes of
cluster analyses, not only because it made it difficult to establish a cognitive
framework in which to conceptualize the data, but also because it exceeded
the capacity of the clustering program and the computer. Furthermore, a
large number of attribute combinations occurred only at very low frequencies,
suggesting that they were aberrant flakes and their interpretation would
coritribute little to a study aimed at eliciting overall patterns of knapping
behavior.
Eighty-seven of the recorded combinations occurred only once or twice
in the entire collection; that is, 57 percent of the variation in flake types
occurred in slightly less than 3 percent of the actual flakes.
For more meaningful analysis of the flake morphology, a smaller
number of attribute combinations had to be selected, so a companion
program to IFREQ, IFREQ 3 PCT, was written. This program expresses the
occurrence of flakes by attribute combinations in terms of their relative
percentages in the sample, as well as in terms of their raw frequencies (Table
5). The final number of flake forms was determined by selecting those
attribute combinations that accounted for at least 0.76 percent of the flakes in
the collection. Using this program, 29 flake types were established, totaling
2,194 flakes; that is, slightly less than 20 percent of the morphological
variability accounted for over 75 percent of the flakes.

STONE TYPE ANALYSIS
The production of stone tools begins with the selection and acquisition of
suitable materials. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of lithic technology takes into account the raw materials from which the artifacts have
been fashioned. This section investigates the relation between the raw
materials used and the forms into which these materials were processed by the
prehistoric residents of the southern Guadalupes.
Six raw material categories have been identified in the survey collection.
They are greenstone, quartzite, cherty limestone, limestone, chert, and
miscellaneous materials; a description of each is presented below. (The
geology of the park, with special emphasis on chert, is described in Boisvert
1980:Appendix 1.)
Greenstone is conspicuous but not abundant in the collection. It is bright
apple green, although it may weather to a bluish slate gray. It is found in
several geologic strata in the Guadalupe Mountains, primarily in the
Manzanita Limestone and other members of the Cherry Canyon Formation.
It is volcanic ash that has settled into still waters, forming bentonite, a clayey
rock that is normally quite friable and has the ability to absorb water, swelling
when it is wet. In the Guadalupes this rock has been metamorphosed into
greenstone, a chertlike rock with conchoidal fracture. Its structure is platy to
blocky, and it occurs in chunks varying from walnut-sized pebbles to blocks
of several cubic meters. It erodes out of the southeast escarpment from the
Pine Springs area northeastward toward the Texas-New Mexico border
(King 1948:37), and in all likelihood it occurs in other areas of the mountains.

Quartzite is extremely common in the Guadalupe Mountains and
constitutes major outcrops in the Cherry Canyon and Bell Canyon formations.
It varies in color from light tan through buffto reddish brown and sometimes
has a greenish tinge. The texture varies from coarse and somewhat friable to
sugary and dense to fine grained and quite dense. It is found in the park along
the southern periphery of the mountains from below Shumla Peak to the
northeast corner of the park (Figure 2). It constitutes the bulk of the Delaware
Mountains and the southeast parts of the Patterson Hills (King 1948:Plate 3).
Large exposures of quartzite can be seen, and great quantities of boulders,
cobbles, and fragments litter the ground in many areas. Quartzite is second
only to limestone in abundance in the region.
Cherty limestone was isolated as a separate material after several
frustrating attempts to identify it as chert or as limestone. Some specimens
made from cherty limestone have very glossy surfaces, are extremely fine
grained, and are comparable to what is usually called chert by archeologists
and lithic technologists. However, the material grades into a much duller
substance that is coarse grained and more closely resembles limestone. It is
generally dark, ranging from brownish black to light brown, often with
light-and dark-brown banding. Such grading of quality from one end of the
spectrum to the other can be found in several samples. Instead of arbitrarily
dividing the material into chert and limestone, it was deemed more
appropriate to recognize it as having qualities of both and to put it into a
separate category. The geologic distribution of the cherty limestone is not
precisely known at this time; according to regional experts, it is common in
the area from E1 Paso to Van Horn and into New Mexico (John Hedrick,
personal communication), and an outcrop may exist within the park.
Limestone is ubiquitous in the Guadalupe Mountains. Indeed, in most
areas it is the Guadalupe Mountains. It ranges from white, platy, friable stone
in the Capitan Formation to a dark, hard, fine-grained material in the Bone
Spring Formation. With the exception of the mainly quartzite south and
southeast reef escarpments, as noted above, virtually all of the exposed rock
in the Guadalupes is limestone. Boulders, cobbles, pebbles, and fragments of
every size litter the canyons, arroyos, and flats. Its quality is highly variable,
but significant supplies of material suitable for flaking are available.
Limestone is second only to chert in the amount of chippage recovered.
Chert is the material most frequently used by the aboriginal knappers in
the southern Guadalupes. It is a very fine-grained cryptocrystalline material,
composed for the most part of silica and variable amounts of impurities. Its
most notable and desirable quality, from the standpoint of the knapper, is its
conchoidal fracture. An attempt was made to identify the varieties of chert
used on the basis of macroscopic sorting, but the task proved to be too
complex and subject to error, since there were no available comparative
collections of cherts from the park or the southern Guadalupes. For the
purpose of analysis, all varieties of chert were treated alike, and no attempt
was made to distinguish between them.
The miscellaneous category comprises a group of rocks that do not
belong in any of the other groups. Some of these materials are specific
nonchert stones such as obsidian. Others are cryptocrystalline silicates such

Boisvert--Guadalupe Mountains

49

as chalcedony and jasper. They are of extremely high quality and in thin
sections are translucent to transparent. The high quality, low frequency (26 in
the entire collection), and lack of similarity to most of the cherts in the
collection suggests that they were obtained outside the park region, as
certainly must be true for the obsidian. The chalcedony and jasper artifacts
are the smallest of the six groups and account for less than 1 percent of the
sample. Included in the miscellaneous category is a white quartzite material
that differs significantly in color and texture from the quartzites known to
exist in the park region. This quartzite is found only in the metate artifact
category.
Artifact Classes and Raw Material Type
Methodology
In order to provide explanations for the selection of particular kinds of
stone for the various kinds of artifacts, a methodology was developed that
included a statistical test to determine the degree of nonrandom distribution
of material types in the artifact classes. First, the frequency of all the artifacts
was tabulated by material type and artifact class. Then a Chi Square
Goodness of Fit Test was run on each artifact category; this was accomplished
by using a WATFIV program written for testing these data.
Data
The data used for the analysis consist of a distribution matrix of the
artifact classes and material types. The artifact classes correspond to the
typological categories defined above in the section describing the data base,
with the exception of two categories, worked hematite and miscellaneous
artifacts. Worked hematite was deleted because the artifact was defined in
terms of its material type, and miscellaneous artifacts were excluded because
the category is not a type of artifact.
A nalysis
The tabulated data were keypunched and processed with the Chi Square
program. The initial test was based on an analysis of the distribution of all six
material types. A preliminary inspection of the output suggested that the very
low frequency of greenstone and miscellaneous stone had caused an upward
skew in the significance values generated by the test. Consequently, an
additional test was run that eliminated the scarce material types from
consideration and compared only quartzite, cherty limestone, limestone, and
chert.
Results and Interpretation
Table 6 presents the significance values generated by both the Chi Square
tests and the distributional data. As expected, there were some changes in the
probabilities of nonrandom distribution when greenstone and miscellaneous
stone were removed from consideration. In two cases, Type Ilia and Type IVa
unifaces, the change in probability that the material type selection was
nonrandom changed from less than an .01 to a greater than .05 confidence
level. In four other cases--Type I and Type Illb unifaces, marginal bifaces,

and drills--there was a similar change in probability that the material type
selection was nonrandom, from an .01 to a less than .05 confidence level.
Interpretations of the test results show that although greenstone of
chippable quality occurs within the park area and is conspicuous where it is
found, it was never extensively utilized. Isolated cores and flakes constitute
the bulk of the greenstone artifacts, with only seven finished tools--all
unifaces--and four unfinished tools--three preforms and a biface broken
during manufacture. The greatest amount of greenstone occurs at site CH31,
adjacent to an outcrop of the material, where 39 flakes, a core, and three
unifaces were collected. The use of greenstone may represent opportunistic
exploitation of a convenient but inferior resource.
In contrast to greenstone, quartzite was locally available and was
frequently used by the prehistoric residents of the southern Guadalupes.
Cores are common in the quartzite assemblage, and in numbers rank second
only to flakes. However, the ratio of flakes to cores--slightly less than three to
one--is the lowest for any material type. This may represent a sampling bias
in the data-collecting process. Since quartzite is native to the region and
abundant in some areas, many flakes, particularly the smaller ones, could be
easily overlooked or dismissed by the field collectors as natural spalls,
especially since flake features such as bulbs and ripple marks are almost
indiscernible in quartzite.
Four artifact categories have statistically significant numbers of quartzite
artifacts, consisting of utilized flakes, both varieties of manos, and metates.
The utilized flakes are mainly large to very large, and 20 of the 33 can be
described as blades. They are long, relatively thin, often narrow flakes, with
relatively straight edges and prismoidal cross sections. Although blades are
found at only one site--CU 19--there is no indication that prismoidal cores
were being systematically fabricated and maintained for the production of
blades. Examination of these artifacts indicates that the knappers were
exploiting the natural shape of the quartzite, which occurs in blocks, making
it a simple matter for the knappers to produce big, long flakes by following the
natural ridges on the stone. The flakes were sequentially removed, thus
producing blades. Areas of cortex on the flakes are common, and some have
cortex covering not only their exterior sides but also their platforms and
terminal ends. A blade-core technology is not evident in the Guadalupes,
since the only tools made on blades were utilized flakes. There were no
projectile points, unifaces, or burins made on blades.
Microscopic examination of the utilized flakes indicated that they were
probably used for cutting purposes, since the edges are rounded and the
polish extends up both sides. Some flakes have massive amounts of polish,
which could have occurred only as a result of long or hard use.
Quartzite was also the favored material for grinding stones. Flat and
convex manos and metates are mainly of quartzite. In three cases an
apparently nonlocal quartzite was used for the grinding slab, and because the
material--a rather coarse white quartzite--bears no resemblance to the
known local varieties, it is tabulated under the miscellaneous heading.
Limestone was also used, but not as extensively as quartzite.

52

Texas Archeological Society

Quartzite also would have been an ideal choice for hammerstones, but
the battered stone artifact category has only four possible examples. In all
likelihood, quartzite pebbles were used as hammerstones; their abundance in
the area suggests that they may not have been retained and used repeatedly.
Furthermore, it would be extremely difficult to discriminate between
quartzite hammerstones and natural pebbles in the field, especially if the
hammerstone was not used extensively.
Cherty limestone is common in the collection, constituting nearly 13
percent of the chippage and 19 percent of the other artifacts. However, it is the
predominant material in only one artifact category--Type I unifaces. It
occurs in relatively high proportions in Types V and VI unifaces as well as in
preforms and both varieties of biface fragments. With one significant
exception--projectile points--cherty limestone generally parallels the distribution of chert artifacts. Only two points, a Type 7 point recovered from a
random surface and a Type 24 (Young) point, were made from cherty
limestone. The relatively large numbers of artifacts in the preform category is
perplexing, in view of the fact that so few finished bifaces of cherty limestone
are reported. It is possible that some of the cherty limestone preforms may be
finished implements, ones for which no secondary trimming was intended,
but no satisfactory explanation for this situation can be found.
Limestone artifacts are common on sites in the Guadalupes, reflecting
the abundance of the material in the area. Although second to chert in most
artifact categories, it is predominant in several. It accounts for 41 percent of
the amorphous cores-- 16 percent more than chert. This figure may be too low
considering that many limestone cores and flakes may not have been collected
due to their resemblance to natural pebbles and spalls. Many pebbles and
spalls were collected as artifacts during the survey, a fact that attests to the
difficulty in discriminating between artifacts and nonartifacts in the field.
Indeed, this is often a difficult task even under more favorable laboratory
conditions.
Limestone and chert are the dominant material type for Type V and VI
unifaces. These are the most generalized forms of unifaces, and little cultural
or temporal significance can be attached to them. Examination of the
collection shows that virtually any material was used for these artifacts, and
that limestone was used nearly as often as chert.
Limestone is significant in the manufacture of three other kinds of
artifacts. Two, the chopping tool and the ovate bifaces made from rather large
pebbles, are quite similar. Limestone pebbles occur in sizes and shapes
convenient for the manufacture of these implements; the only other material
that consistently has these characteristics is quartzite. The preference for
limestone over quartzite might be explained by the overall suitability of
limestone to flaking. Limestone is softer and lighter than quartzite; consequently it would be easier to flake with the quartzite hammerstone.
Replicative experiments using materials native to the Guadalupes might
confirm this hypothesis or suggest other avenues of explanation. At this
point, however, it is not possible to explain further the preference for
limestone over quartzite for the production of the large bifaces. The third

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

53

artifact category in which the use of limestone is significant is tabular bifaces.
The use of limestone to produce the tabular bifaces is environmentally
determined, since limestone is the only material available that naturally
occurs in thin sheets. Manufacture of implements from this material is simple
and requires only an appropriate source and virtually any kind of percussor.
The stone knappers of the Guadalupes exploited the tabular limestone to
produce tools with exceptionally long (some as much as 20.8 cm) bifacial
edges.
Chert was the most widely used chippable stone in the Guadalupe
M ountains. It was the preferred material for four varieties of unifaces--Types
IVb, IVc, V, and VI--and for the production of small bifaces, especially
projectile points. The preference for chert in the production of thinned bifaces
can be viewed as an interplay between the inherent qualities of the material
and the desired attributes of the implement. Very hard, sharp edges can be
fashioned in chert, and these are qualities desirable in tools designed for
piercing, cutting, and scraping. The cryptocrystalline quality of chert is
eminently suited to the removal of the thin, flat flakes that are required in the
final stages of reduction and shaping of most bifaces. Such final stages of
reduction produce relatively large quantities of flakes, especially in proportion
to the mass of material involved; this would explain the high number of chert
flakes compared to flakes of other materials.
In general, the use of stone for tool manufacture in the Guadalupes can
be described as follows. Very specialized chipped stone tools, such as
projectile points, were made almost exclusively from chert. Grinding tools
were made mainly from quartzite, but occasionally from limestone. Tools
with large mass or cutting or scraping edges were commonly made from
limestone. Most unifaces were made from chert or limestone, although all
kinds of materials were used. Flake knives were usually made from quartzite
or, to a lesser degree, chert. The miscellaneous category is made up of
high-quality silicates such as obsidian, jasper, and chalcedony. These
materials are presumably exotic in origin, and their usage tends to parallel
that of chert.
Flake Size and Material Type
This section deals with the interrelations between the material types and
the chippage. It has been implicitly assumed that the use of different kinds of
raw material in the manufacture of different kinds of artifacts will result in
patterned distributions of different flake sizes. The validity of the assumption
was tested by flake-size analysis.
The Data
The data selected for the study of this problem were based on all of the
flakes in the survey collection, and derived through observations of flake size
and material type, which were encoded together with platform, bulb, and
body states. Frequencies for each combination of flake size and material type
were obtained.

54

Texas Archeological Society

Methodology
The method of analysis entailed arranging the frequency data in matrix
form and comparing the relative frequencies of the sizes and raw material
types of the flakes. The objective of this inductive approach was to describe
and quantify the patterns of flake size and material type. The interpretations
of this information were then compared to findings concerning the raw
materials available and the forms into which these materials were processed
(Figures 17, 18).

Figure 18. Relative frequency of flakes of size and material type.

The frequency of the flake sizes for each of the material types and the
relative percentages are presented in Figure 17. The raw count for each
category is in the upper left part of the cell, the raw percentage is in the right
side of the cell, and the column percentage is at the bottom of the cell. For
example, the raw frequency for small chert flakes is 61, which constitutes 4
percent of all chert flakes and 91.3 percent of all small flakes. Figure 18
presents the same data in a cumulative histogram.
A nalysis and Interpretations
It is apparent from the distributions that there is a consistent trend in
flake sizes according to material types. The chert flakes are consistently small;
greenstone flakes are almost equally divided between small and medium;
cherty limestone flakes are consistently medium to small; limestone flakes fall
into the medium category, although nearly a quarter of them are large; and
quartzite flakes are the largest. Flakes of miscellaneous materials tend to be
medium to small, but they are so few in number that size comparisons to
flakes of other material types may not be valid.

56

Texas Archeological Society

The interpretation of these distributions incorporates several factors,
one of which is sampling error. Limestone and quartzite flakes probably were
not recognized in the field as frequently and consistently as were chert and
cherty limestone. The escarpment and foothill areas are littered with
boulders, cobbles, and spalls of both quartzite and limestone, and their
abundance probably masked the presence of the culturally derived quartzite
and limestone debitage. Flakes of those materials are probably underrepresented in the collection, especially in the smaller-sized specimens.
Another factor in the distribution of the samples is the size of the raw
materials as they occur in nature. Cherts have not been found, and greenstone
has been found only rarely, in the Guadalupes in large blocks. However, large
cobbles or boulders of limestone and quartzite are commonly found. Thus,
certain parameters are imposed on the flake sizes by the form in which the raw
materials naturally occur.
Other factors that would bias the distribution of flake sizes are the
method of flaking and the definite preferences for certain materials for the
manufacture of specific artifact types. Logically, the manufacture of small
bifaces, which were made from chert, would entail the production of small
flakes, and the manufacture of large bifaces, which were made from
limestone, would probably entail the production of a large number of
medium-to-large flakes. Furthermore, an important factor in the choice of
material for the manufacture of a given tool is its potential for producing
certain kinds of flakes. The cryptocrystalline silicates are much more likely to
produce small, thin flakes than are the coarser, less glassy, limestones and
quartzites.
The distribution of flake sizes and material types results not from any
one variable, but from the interplay of several variables. The size and quality
of the raw material, the forms into which it was processed, and the techniques
utilized in that process all contribute to the distribution of flakes of different
sizes and materials. The tool makers in the Guadalupes clearly recognized the
limiting factors of their lithic resources and adapted their tool-making
behavior accordingly.
Flake Form and Material Type
A logical next step after the flake-size and material-type analysis is
consideration of the relations between flake forms and materials. Because
specific interrelations exist among material types, artifact forms, and flake
sizes within the assemblages analyzed, patterns of distribution of flake forms
in the various material can be expected. Analysis of the flake forms should
therefore provide some degree of confirmation of the findings presented
above, and it is hoped that it will also provide some unique insights into the
flaking of the different material types.
Methodology
The 29 flake morphologies that have been described above were
subjected to a hierarchical clustering analysis in order to determine the most
frequently co-occurring groups of flake forms. One interpretation of these
clusters resulted in the ordering of the flake forms along one axis of a

!

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

57

cumulative percentage graph, which was used to compare the frequencies of
the flake forms for the various material types.
The percentage of each form was computed for each material type, and
from a cumulative total of these percentages a cumulative line graph (Figure
19) was prepared for the flake forms of the five material types. Using these
data, the percentages, and the graphic display, correlations of material types
with flake forms could be made.
A nalysis and Interpretations
From Table 7 and Figure 19 it can be seen that some overall patterns are
evident for the flakes as a whole and for particular aspects of certain types of
materials.
Certain attribute combinations are more common in some material types
than in others. Limestone flakes have more single-faceted platforms with
thick to angular decorticated bodies. Chert flakes are much more likely to
have complex, or multifaceted, platforms with thin-to-medium noncortex
bodies. Cherty limestone falls between limestone and chert, with substantially
fewer angular body flakes than limestone and somewhat fewer thin-tomedium noncortex body flakes than chert. Quartzite also falls between
limestone and chert but diverges from their distributions, with a greater
percentage of flakes with cortex and a decidedly smaller percentage of
complex-platformed flakes, especially when compared with chert. The
greenstone flake sample is much smaller than the other raw material samples

but is notable for the relatively large proportion of flakes with shattered and
broken platforms. Newell et al. (1953:64) report that the siliceous content of
greenstone is low--51 to 61 percent--and that the clay content is fairly
high--20 to 24 percent. The green color is the result of finely disseminated
grains of minerals of the chlorite group, alteration products of volcanic ash
(Newell et al. 1953:64), which apparently cause the material to lack the
hardness and strength of chert. This weakness may account for the high
proportion of greenstone flakes with broken platforms (8.41 percent)
compared to flakes of limestone (1.98 percent), and chert (1.66 percent). The
generally low silica content, together with the decomposed nature of the
original ash structures, may explain the preponderance of broken platforms
on the greenstone flakes.
Quartzite is also a local material, but its pattern of flake-form
frequencies and distributions differs from greenstone. Not only are cortical
areas frequent, but quartzite seems to be an exceptionally strong material.
Shattered and broken platforms are relatively rare, a fact which, together
with the low frequency of complex platforms, strengthens the premise that the
material was selected for the production of cutting blades because of its
naturally large size, availability, and overall strength and durability.
The dominant feature of the chert flake forms is their large proportion of
multifaceted, flat, medium-to-thin, noncortex flakes. In addition, similar
flakes with straight platforms are also quite common. This particular
distribution attests to the fact that chert was the material most frequently
selected for the manufacture of small, morphologically complex bifaces. Two
of the flake forms--thin and medium noncortex flakes that are multifaceted
and thin bulbed--are usually interpreted as typical flakes associated with
final trimming and maintenance of bifaces. This interpretation is supported
by the fact that in cherty limestone, which has a low frequence of bifaces, there
is a very low percentage of such flakes.
Summary and Conclusions
The analysis of flake forms based on material type tends to confirm the
interpretations developed from the analyses correlating material type with
artifact type and flake size with material type. Chippage associated with the
production and maintenance of bifaces and other morphologically complex
artifacts tends to be chert. Chipped stone artifacts that require long, durable
edges are made from quartzite, and the nature of the quartzite chippage
affirms the contention that it is indeed a strong and durable material.
Limestone is a ubiquitous material in the region, and its distribution in both
the artifacts and flake assemblages suggests that it was most suitable for the
manufacture of simple tools such as unifaces or large tools that would have
required large cores. The distribution of cherty limestone chippage and
artifacts parallels that of limestone, with the exception of large bifaces. One
might speculate for that reason that large pieces of cherty limestone do not
occur in nature. Greenstone was not a popular material of the prehistoric
knappers of the Guadalupes, as the flake study suggests, because its platforms
have a tendency to break, although it appears to be suitable at first glance.
The sample of miscellaneous material is both too diverse and too small to
warrant any detailed analysis.

DEBITAGE ANALYSIS

For the purposes of this report, debitage includes not only waste flakes,
but also implements broken prehistorically by use, during manufacture, or by
accident, and subsequently abandoned or discarded. Also included in
debitage are implements abandoned during manufacture because of problems
such as failure to thin, excessive hinge fracturing, and edge collapse. Not
included in debitage are implements that were broken intentionally or broken
by farm equipment or by excavators after they had been committed to the
archeological record as completed tools. The study of debitage, rather than
complete implements, is the focus of this report for two reasons. First, the
finished products usually reflect only the final stages of manufacture, whereas
the debitage reflects all stages. Second, the completed implements in the
survey collection constitute a very small sample when compared to the
debitage. The analysis of the debitage is divided into two parts: first, a
hierarchical clustering analysis of the chippage, the purpose of which is to
provide an empirical definition of flake types and to explain from a
technological standpoint the relative distribution of different flake forms; and
second, an analysis of the broken and unfinished implements. The analysis of
broken and unfinished implements provides some insights into the modes of
chipped stone tool manufacture and tool use in the southern Guadalupes. In
other words, two questions are considered: "What can the site collections tell
us about flake assemblages?" and "What can flake assemblages tell us about
the sites?" It has been important throughout this analysis to maintain the
distinction between these two questions in order to avoid a tautology.
Hierarchical Clustering of Flake Attribute Combinations
The first step in the cluster analysis was to determine the natural
groupings of flake forms found on the sites, then to use the same data base to
determine which sites have the most similar flake assemblages. The eventual
goal was to elucidate at least some facets of tool-making behavior.
The Data
The flake clustering analysis used flake morphology data drawn from the
output of IFREQ 3 PCT as described in the section on Flake Typology. Each
case was defined as one of the 29 attribute combinations (see Table 5). The
variables were defined as the distribution of the frequencies of the flake forms
at each site (Table 8).
The sites selected for analysis had to satisfy certain criteria. They had to
have at least 20 analyzable flakes. The total number of flakes on the site,
regardless of whether or not they were included in the 29 flake forms selected
for analysis, was used. Another criterion was that the collection of artifacts at
the sites, as could be determined from the field notes, was not overly biased.
The field notes for some sites indicated that chippage was generally ignored or
that no attempt was made to gather representative samples. For that reason,
sites were reviewed individually before being included in the analysis.

Methodology
The cluster analysis used MATRIX, HCLUS, and PLINK computer
programs gathered together and articulated by Don W. Graybill (1975).
Clustering programs available from the Bimed series (BMDP 2M) (Dixon
1975:323-330) and the H Group clustering program described by Veldman
(1967:308-319) were also tested.
The Bimed and Veldman cluster programs were used to verify the results
of the HCLUS program. All three programs produced essentially the same
results, but with slightly different output displays. The HCLUS version was
chosen because it not only displayed the clusters in the form of more clearly
understood dendrograms, but it also printed the correlation matrix of all
possible comparisons between cases that allowed for specific case-by-case
comparisons.
The HCLUS program offers eight options with which to perform
clustering operations, and a choice of two kinds of matrices, each of which
can be derived from one of four possible combinations of standardizations of
the data. The options for performing the clustering are
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)
7)
8)

Nearest Neighbor
Furthest Neighbor, complete linkage
Weighted Pair group arithmetic averages
Unweighted Pair group arithmetic averages
Median, weighted centroid
Centroid, unweighted centroid
Lance Williams Flexible Method
Ward’s Method

The distance similarities matrix is offered as appropriate for methods 1
through 4 and the correlation similarities matrix is recommended for
methods 5 through 8. Standardization options are offered for both columns
(variables) and rows (cases to be clustered).
Following the work done by Graybill (1975), Ward’s method was chosen
for analysis. Briefly, the program creates the clusters by calculating a distance
that expresses the degree of similarity between any two cases in the sample. It
then merges the two cases that are most similar and treats them as one case
from then on. It then selects the next two cases that are most similar and
merges them. This procedure is continued until all cases are merged into one.
The end result is displayed as a dendrogram with N-1 mergings when N equals
the number of cases.
In all tests, standardization by column (variables) was applied. This was
accomplished by expressing the frequencies in terms of percentage rather
than raw count. This operation has the effect of giving each variable equal
weight of significance, thus preventing abundantly represented variables
from obscuring relatively rare variables. Each cluster analysis was run both
with and without the option for standardization by row (cases). This
operation would have the same kind of effect as standardization by column.
The applicability of these options is discussed and evaluated for each of the
cluster analyses in the section to follow. In all, four clusterings were
generated, two clusterings of flake forms using site flake assemblages as

Boisvert--Guadalupe Mountains

63

variables (standardized and nonstandardized) and two clusterings of the site
flake assemblages with the flake forms as variables (again, standardized and
nonstandardized).
A nalysis and Interpretation, Cases Not Standardized
The clustering of the flake forms without the standardization by case is
presented in dendrogram form (Figure 20). It indicates that there are two
distinct blocks within the flake sample. A comparison with Figure 17 reveals
that Cluster II contains the seven most abundant flake forms, accounting for
70.99 percent of all flakes in the sample. The rest of the sample accounts for
29.01 percent of the flakes chosen for analysis. Raw frequency is the
determining factor in differentiating between these two groups of flakes.
However, within each cluster, the size of each case (i.e., frequency of each
flake form) does not seem to be significant.
The clusters can be viewed as two separate, though similar, dendrograms.
Cluster I is composed of six subclusters. Cluster Ia reflects activities involved

with the initial reduction of cores. It contains four of the six flake forms that
have cortical areas either on their platforms or bodies. The fifth case has no
cortex, but it does have a double-faceted platform and a thick body,
suggesting vigorous percussion flaking with the intention of removing a large
flake. Experimental studies suggest that double platforms are especially
strong and resist shattering. Otherwise the platforms are simple and the
bodies are medium to thick in cross section.
Cluster Ib probably relates to the thinning or rejuvenation of bifaces.
The flakes are uniformly thin, with normal and flat bulbs and straight and
multifaceted platforms. The exteriors of the flake bodies lack any evidence of
cortex.
Cluster Ic contains five flake forms that are commonly produced by the
secondary reduction of cores. The remaining two varieties of flakes with
cortical areas are included in the group, together with both examples of
sequent flakes and a flake with a straight platform, exuberant bulb, and thick
cross section. The exuberant bulb suggests hard hammer percussion, or at
least vigorous soft hammer percussion. The sequent flakes indicate that at
least some flakes have already been removed from the core.
Cluster Id contains only two varieties of flakes, flakes with normal bulbs
and flakes with flat bulbs. Both have complex (multifaceted) platforms and
thick noncortical bodies. The combination of multifaceted platforms and
thick cross sections suggests that these flakes were produced by soft hammer
shaping of partially finished bifaces.
Cluster Ie contains flakes that are predominantly of medium thickness.
Both varieties of flakes with broken platforms are in this group, as are two of
the three kinds of flakes with double-faceted platforms. The third form is one
of the two exuberant-bulbed flakes and has a straight platform. This cluster
shows evidence of having been produced either by hard hammer or vigorous
soft hammer flaking which often produces bulbs and broken platforms.
Cluster If consists exclusively of flakes with shattered platforms. These
flakes usually result from poor platform preparation or selection, or from
inappropriately delivered blows. Their thin-to-medium thickness and normal
bulbs suggest that they are products of soft hammer percussion, possibly in
the thinning of bifaces or the manufacture of unifaces.
Cluster II is represented by only seven flake forms, each of which is quite
numerous in the collection. Cluster IIa consists of three flake forms, each of
which has a straight single-facet platform with normal-to-flat bulb and
medium-to-thick body. These flakes would be by-products of core preparation
or initial biface reduction done prior to fracture. In either case, they are not
the result of bifacial shaping, as the platforms are not multifaceted. The
thickness of the flakes and the nature of bulbs suggest fairly strong soft
hammer percussion.
Cluster lib is composed of two flake forms. One has a complex platform,
normal bulb, and medium thickness; the other has a simple platform, flat
bulb, and thick cross section. Both lack cortex on their bodies. This cluster
may represent the result of further soft hammer core reduction with the
beginnings of bifacial shaping.
Cluster IIc also is composed of two flake forms, both of which have
multifaceted platforms and flat bulbs. They differ in the presence of medium-

Boisvert--Guadalupe Mountains

65

to-thin noncortical body states. These varieties of flakes are typical results of
the final stages of bifacial manufacture and trimming, and of biface
rejuvenation.
These nine attribute clusters can be interpreted as representing the
by-products of chipped stone tool manufacture. This process may be
conceptualized as containing several steps, each with characteristic products
and by-products. The scheme illustrated below is an attempt to isolate several
activity sets, some of which are optional in the manufacture of chipped stone
tools. This is presented in the full realization that such behavior actually
constitutes a continuum and that divisions between activities are in large part
arbitrary. However, since chipped stone tool manufacture is of necessity a
reductive process in which the tool becomes smaller as the process continues,
it is legitimate to assume that certain activities must precede others. A biface
cannot be rejuvenated until it has been finished, and the secondary trimming
of an implement, if it occurs at all, must follow the primary trimming.
Figure 21 presents an outline of the steps or activity sets that have been
defined by Collins (1975:25) in the overall process of chipped stone implement

manufacture. Table 9 presents the relationship between the flake clusters and
the product groups. Some categories, such as preforms, are general categories
and are found in more than one product group. In a sense, a piece of raw
material that fortuitously resembles a finished or near-finished tool is also a
preform. However, for the purposes of this study a preform is a generalized
bifacial form that is produced after the initiation of chipping and before the
final shaping and thinning of the tool.
Some flake clusters crosscut product groups. This is due in part to the
lumping nature of the clustering program; however, activities associated with
different stages of chipped stone tool manufacture do produce similar flakes.

Product groups iii through vi are well represented in the collection in
terms of both raw frequency and variety of flake clusters. Product group i
does not usually have flakes associated with it; consequently, no clusters
would be associated with it. Product group ii has only Cluster Ia assigned to
it. Although 5 of the 29 attribute combinations make up this cluster, its total
frequency is quite low. This may be due to three factors: (1) sampling error, (2)
low production of such flakes in the normal sequence of lithic reduction, or
(3) the infrequent incidence of behavior that would result in the production of
flakes that form this cluster. In addition, the relative frequency of the major
component of this cluster, flakes with cortical platforms or bodies, would be
influenced by the nature of the raw material. Essentially identical activities by
the same knappers with different materials would result in entirely different
ratios of cortex- to noncortex-bearing flakes. These data indicate that the
acquisition and initial reduction of cores was not a major activity on the sites
surveyed.
Product group vii is not represented at all in the survey collection, since
such materials would come only from excavated site contexts.
The relationship of the clusters of flake forms to the product groups is
incorporated into the arrangements of the cumulative percentage graphs in
Figures 25 through 31.
The flake forms are organized according to their clusters (Figure 22)
which are arranged in the order of the assigned product groups. The forms
associated with the earliest stage (product group ii) are at the lower end of the
scale, and those associated with the final stages (product groups v and vi) are
at the top. The part of the horizontal axis of the graph specific to each
subcluster is shown, indicating the overlap between product groups.
A nalysis and Interpretations, Standardized Data
Analyzing the same data but applying standardization by rows (sites)
produces a dendrogram that is different, although it is somewhat similar
(Figure 23) to the one generated without the row percentages. Three major
blocks of clusters are recognizable. Cluster I consists of either very rare flake
types or flakes that are best described as fragmentary, such as flakes with
missing platforms. Cluster II contains a variety of flakes that tend to be
thinner than the rest of the sample. Cluster III is composed of flakes similar to
those in Cluster II, but thicker than average.
The organization of the standardized flake clusters could also suggest
that there are two modes of flaking within the samples, in addition to a group
of rare or essentially unclassifiable flake forms that have little relevance to
either of the apparent activities.
Cluster I contains six flake forms, all of which are merged at a relatively
high order, indicating dissimilar distributions in the sample (i.e., sites). They
include both varieties of flakes with broken platforms, both examples of
flakes with exuberant bulbs, and two of the three flake forms with straight
double platforms. Both medium and thick forms are represented in the
cluster, with indications of an internal differentiation between the two. This
cluster reflects hard hammer percussion. Large bulbs of percussion and
broken platforms are phenomena usually, although not exclusively, associated
with hard hammers. Replicative experiments also suggest that double-faceted

platforms are significantly stronger than simple platforms and are less likely
to break, crush, or shatter when percussion flaking is applied. Significantly,
no flake forms with cortical areas are included in this cluster, which suggests
that these flaking activities are not related to the acquisition of raw materials
or the preparation of the cores (product group i or ii). In addition, there are in
this cluster no flakes with thin cross sections and complex platforms. The
inference is that these flakes are the result of the primary trimming of cores
(product group iii). Cluster I, the final merging accomplished in the clustering
process, is distinct from the two other major clusters, suggesting that the
flakes were produced at sites different from the ones where the materials were
acquired and processed.
Cluster 11 can be subdivided into at least two subclusters. Cluster lla
comprises thin flakes with either flat or medium bulbs and either single or

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

multifaceted platforms. Cluster lib contains flakes with shattered platforms
and a multifaceted flat flake with secondary cortex body. Six of the seven
flake forms of the cluster are thin, all of the bulbs are either flat or medium,
and only two of the seven forms have single-faceted platforms. Therefore,
these two clusters are believed to represent the secondary trimming and final
shaping of thin bifaces, probably by soft hammer percussion and possibly by
pressure flaking. The occurrence of a flake form with cortex on part of its
body is somewhat anomalous, although certainly not unexpectable. This
form is rare in the assemblage, accounting for only 24 specimens (0.83
percent) in the total sample, and 22 specimens in the sample from sites
selected for clustering. The nature of the present sample makes it impossible
to explain this situation adequately.
Cluster III is subdivided into three or possibly four subclusters. Cluster
Ilia consists of the six forms that occur most frequently in the typology. Two
multifaceted forms merge at a low order and are then joined by four forms

with simple platforms that are also merged at a low order. Most of the body
states are medium, but two are thick noncortical types. Medium and flat
bulbs are evenly distributed.
Cluster IIIb is composed of four flake forms. Two are multifaceted, thick
noncortical flakes, one is double-faceted medium, and one is single-faceted
secondary cortical. The constituents of the subcluster are more diverse than
those of Ilia and do not form as tight a cluster.
Cluster Illc comprises only two forms, both of which are thick and have
cortex either on their bodies or on their platforms, which are essentially
simple and unmodified. These atributes seem to relate them to the earlier
stages of either reduction.
Cluster IIId also is composed of only two forms. This subcluster contains
the only flake forms with sequent platforms. They differ only in the bulb
attributes, which are either flat or normal. This subcluster combines with the
rest of Cluster III at a very high order. Since flakes of this subcluster represent
less than 1.7 percent of the total sample, their association with the rest of the
flakes in Cluster II may not be significant. The nature of the sample and its
size is the source of the uncertainty.
Cluster IV is formed of only two flake forms and by default is defined as a
separate cluster. It is quite distinct from the other clusters and is one of the
final mergings accomplished in the hierarchical grouping. Both flake forms
are rare and number more than two at only one site, HZ52, the site with the
largest assemblages of chippage.
Cluster IIIc can be interpreted as the result of initial reduction of cores.
The thick bodies and cortical areas on the flakes are an argument for
assigning this cluster to product group ii. Cluster Ilia probably relates mainly
to the primary trimming of cores, with some suggestion that the forms with
multifaceted platforms may be the products of secondary trimming.
Both Clusters IIa and lib seem to be derived from activities associated
with the secondary trimming processes, with a suggestion of some primary
trimming related to Cluster lib. The chippage is thin, with a preponderance of
complex and shattered platforms. The trend toward flatness of the bulbs and
the thin flakes suggest soft hammer percussion.
One interpretation of the pattern of clustering derived from this analysis
is that there are two distinct flaking activity sets represented in the sample.
Clusters I, IV, and IIIc stand essentially isolated from the rest of the clusters.
They represent the earliest stages of flaking--basically core preparation and
the primary shaping of the core. All of the flake forms from these clusters are
relatively scarce in the sample, casting some doubt on their exact relationship
to the rest of the flake forms. However, it is apparent that they do stand apart
from the main constituents of Clusters II and III.
Cluster III contains subclusters that represent flaking activities from
core preparation (IIIb) through primary trimming (Ilia) and possibly some
secondary trimming (the multifaceted forms of IIIa). These activities may
reflect the production and maintenance of unifacial and, possibly, bifacial
scrapers. The dominance of thick flakes and a large proportion of straight
platforms tend to confirm this interpretation. Straight platforms reasonably

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

71

would be associated with uniface manufacture and maintenance. Thick flakes
are more likely to occur as a result of primary trimming than secondary.
Cluster II contains flake forms in its subclusters which seem to relate
most consistently to the secondary flaking and maintenance of bifacial
implements. It is possible that partially finished forms were imported to sites
and then finished, or that completed tools were being resharpened or
recycled. This is not to suggest that these are the only activities concerning
biface production that were carried out on the sites included in the sample.
Since the manufacture of bifaces also included those stages necessary for the
production of unifaces, it is reasonable to assume that in some cases chippage
associated with Cluster III resulted from the production of bifaces as well.
The two methods of treating the flake data--standardizing or not
standardizing by cases--have produced two interpretations. The first attempt
at clustering without standardization generated a dendrogram that defined
two major groups subdivided into nine subclusters. The composition of these
subclusters coincides closely to flake forms that might be expected to occur
during various stages in the process of lithic reduction.
The second attempt at clustering utilized the option to standardize the
data by case. This meant that the clustering of flakes would be less sensitive to
the number of flakes in each case. This clustering produced a dendrogram
with three major clusters and one minor cluster. The three major clusters were
subdivided into eight subclusters, which have been interpreted as representing
two different varieties of flaking: one oriented toward the manufacture of
unifaces, the other toward the manufacture and maintenance of bifacial
implements.
Hierarchical Clustering of Sites
The application of hierarchical clustering techniques in order to
delineate the clusters of sites that are most alike on the basis of their flake
assemblages uses the same data and methodology but inverts the data matrix
so as to render the sites as cases and the flake forms as variables.
A nalysis and Interpretations, Cases Not Standardized
The cluster analysis of sites, derived from the flake data, used options for
both standardizing and not standardizing the cases (sites). Cluster analysis
using the data nonstandardized by case yielded inconclusive results, since the
dendrogram that was generated simply merged sites on the basis of their
sample size only. For the purpose of interpreting the site clusters, the
standardized data is considered to be more appropriate.
A nalysis and Interpretations, Cases Standardized
The dendrogram for the site clustering analysis of standardized cases
reveals four major divisions, which have been termed Clusters I, II, III, and
IV (Figure 24). Several of the subclusters within the major divisions are the
result of the pairing of two sites with small sample sizes, usually 40 or fewer
flakes. Although these subclusters may represent actual patterns within the
overall scheme, their small sample size casts doubt on their validity. More
confidence can be placed in clusters with more than two sites, or with sites that
have a significantly larger number of flakes.

Figure 24. Clusters standardized by flake forms.

Before discussing the result of the clustering analysis, it should be noted
that CU34 is unique in that of the 27 flakes that could be analyzed fewer than
30 percent corresponded to one of the 29 flake forms chosen for further
analysis. Significantly, all but 8 of the 27 flakes had cortex on their bodies or
platforms, and of these 8, 5 were classed as either thick or angular in body
thickness. The initial stages of lithic reduction were carried out here, probably
by hard hammer percussion.
Seven subclusters were selected for interpretation, three from Cluster I,
two from Cluster IV, and one each from Clusters II and III. In the discussion
that follows, each cluster is accompanied by a site location map and a
cumulative percentage line graph that shows the percentage of each flake
form for each site in the cluster.
It should be noted that the cumulative percentage graphs in Figures 25
through 31 differ from the one in Figure 19 in the order in which the flakes are
listed. Figure 19 reflects clustering without standardization of the flake
frequencies; however, the clustering of sites based upon their flake assemblages

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

73

incorporates standardization of the flake frequencies. Consequently, the
cumulative percentage graphs use the clustering of flake forms standardized
by case (flake forms), as shown in Figure 23.
Cluster Ia (Figure 25) is made up of four sites, with sample sizes ranging
between 76 and 262. Flakes with straight platforms account for a large part of
the variation in this group; only a few flakes have complex, shattered, or
broken platforms. Flakes with cortex are relatively abundant when compared
to other clusters. This cluster has no temporal significance, as all ceramic
periods are represented; however, only one sherd was found at CU43, casting
doubt on the assignment of a ceramic date to that site. All of the sites are fairly
large; two (CU31 and CU43) are near springs and the other two are in an area
where there are many other sites. Product group ii and iii flakes are very well
represented, and the absence of product group iv and v flakes suggests that
unifaces were being produced in considerable numbers. If this is the case, it is
likely--assuming that the unifaces were used as scrapers in domestic
situations--that Cluster Ia represents a group of sites where domestic activity
was the dominant behavior. Unifaces and hearths are common, especially at
CU18 and CU19.
Cluster Ib (Figure 26) is in many respects similar to Cluster Ia. Three sites
compose this cluster, and the sizes of the flake samples range between 26 and
383. It is questionable that the smallest site, HZ42, should be included, due to
the possibility of chance or sampling error. Like Cluster Ia, the collections
from the other sites are fairly large, and these sites were called campsites by
the field crews. HZ52 is a well-dated early ceramic site, and the other sites,

HZ42 and CU83, are aceramic, suggesting a late preceramic to early ceramic
period occupation. The difference between these sites and Cluster Ia is the
larger proportion of bifacial retouching flakes (flake Cluster IIc). Although
there are indications of a slightly larger component of product group iv flakes
(flake Cluster lib), flakes with straight platforms predominate. The evidence
indicates that there was some manufacture of bifacial implements here and, at
least at sites HZ52 and CU83, probable manufacture of a considerable
number of unifaces.
Cluster Ic (Figure 27) also is similar to the other subclusters, although
sites CU33 and CU38 yielded only 72 and 32 flakes, respectively. Much of the
materials from these sites, including the chippage, was limestone, which may
account in part for the configuration of the curves. The margin of difference
between this cluster and Clusters Ia and Ib results from the smaller
proportion of straight-platformed flakes. In part, the difference is made by
flakes with cortex and, at CU38, a larger number of bifacial trimming flakes.
Because there are only two sites in this cluster, they are difficult to assess.
Since no ceramics are present at either site, they may have been preceramic
occupations or peripheral occupations by later peoples. The flaking technique
suggested for these sites relates most strongly to the earlier stages of
implement manufacture, for at only one of the sites (and there probably only
one item) was there a possibility of some final reduction.
Five of the eight sites in Cluster II form a Subcluster that is suitable for
interpretation (Figure 28). The sample size in Cluster IIa varies from 33 to 68,

indicating that the sites have little chippage. The curves in the cluster all reveal
the same trend; a very low percentage of flakes associated with product
groups ii and iii, but fairly high and consistent percentages of flakes
associated with product groups iv, v, and vi. The activity suggested here is the
processing of bifaces that have been started at another place. The evidence is
clear that the later stages of implement (probably bifaces) manufacture were
carried out at these sites. There does not seem to be any temporal loading to
this cluster, since two sites are ceramic, two are early ceramic, and one is late
ceramic.
If Cluster II represents later stages of lithic reduction, then Cluster III
certainly represents earlier stages (Figure 29). Product group iii flakes,
especially flake Cluster Ia, account for the bulk of the flakes. The manufacture
of unifaces seems to have been the prime activity at the sites in Cluster III,
since evidence for further artifact reduction is lacking. Too, there are very few
flakes with cortical areas, implying that initial reduction of cores was not
being done in any quantity.
Cluster IV contains two subclusters suitable for interpretation. Cluster
IVa has two sites, CU20 with 39 flakes and CU85 with 94 flakes (Figure 30),
but there is little apparent similarity between the sites. Site CU20 has a much
larger percentage of flakes with shattered platforms and with straight
platforms than does CU85. Sites CU20 and CU85 are, however, more similar
in their proportion of Cluster IIIc flakes. This seems to be a poor cluster and
may be an indication of inadequacies in the clustering program and the data
base.
Cluster IVb appears to be more cohesive than IVa (Figure 31). Three
sites, CU96, HZ29, and HZ53, compose the core of the cluster. Two other
sites with much smaller sample sizes (20 flakes each) were tentatively added to
the cluster. Their curves resemble those of the core sites, although they run
above and below the larger sites. Sample size is again a problem. The
interpretations of this subcluster apply primarily to the larger sites, and may
or may not apply to the other two. In many respects Cluster IVb resembles
Cluster lib, with a high proportion of final shaping flakes and a fair number
of intermediate flakes, but there is a decided scarcity of flakes with broken
platforms and a higher proportion of Cluster IIIc flakes. The flaking was
apparently more successful at the Cluster IVb sites than at the lib sites. Two
of the sites are aceramic (CU91 and CU96), two (HZ46 and HZ53) have
intermediate period ceramics, and one (HZ29) has early period ceramics.
Thus there is no obvious temporal loading in this cluster.
Summary of Site Clustering
The cluster analysis of the sites with at least a fair representation of
chippage provides some interesting insights into stone tool manufacture in
the southern Guadalupes. No particular patterns were related to temporal
manifestations; indeed, many of the activities that produce chipped stone
implements occur in all time periods, thus masking any sensitive indicators.
Knappers had to meet and solve a variety of problems with a limited number
of solutions, and it is not surprising that many of the same methods were used
over long periods of time.

The clustering analysis does successfully isolate sites at which similar
stages of lithic reduction were carried out. Cluster Ib is the closest
representation of start-to-finish bifacial implement manufacture. Cluster Ia is
similar, but there was probably less final biface trimming. At the sites that
constitute Clusters IIa and IVb we find the processing of implements that
seem to have been brought to the site in partially finished form. Artifacts with
primary trimming or shaping were produced at sites of Cluster III. Whether
these artifacts were unifaces or only a stage in the production of bifaces is
uncertain.
Biface Fragment Analysis
The second largest category of artifacts in the typology is biface
fragments. As the name implies, these are pieces of bifaces that lack
diagnostic features assignable to one of the more specific categories.
The Data
The data for this aspect of the study are drawn from the tabulation of
nearly 400 bifaces and biface fragments collected by the TAS survey. As part
of the initial sorting of the artifacts into the typological categories, the biface
fragments and bifaces that were identified as discards during manufacture
were set aside for separate analysis. Biface fragments, except for those that
were heat damaged, were divided into two basic types: those with transverse
fractures, which presumably occurred during manufacture and caused the

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

79

biface to split transversely along the cross section; and those with snap
fractures, which are clean breaks and give no hint of origin.
Eleven criteria for assessing the nature and degree of biface breakage
and/or discard were chosen for analysis. Although these criteria do not
encompass all possible kinds of chipping errors or problems, they are the ones
that occur frequently in replicative experiments and in the archeological
record (Collins 1975) and can be identified without elaborate and costly
laboratory facilities. All of the features described below could be detected
macroscopically or with the aid of a hand lens. Described below are the most
frequently encountered causes of broken bifaces.
Heat Damage
Heating can cause a change in the flaking quality of a piece of chert. This
is often desirable, but extreme heat causes a considerable amount of damage
and breakage. Heat can produce small round spalls, commonly called potlids,
on the surface of an artifact and can change the internal structure of the
material, causing it to lose its smooth conchoidal fracture and to break
irregularly with granular texture. In addition, excessive heating may cause the
artifact simply to shatter, presumably along preexisting flaws or stress planes.
Often the fracture surfaces on heat-damaged artifacts are indistinguishable
from snap fractures, and the heat-damaged pieces are recognizable only from
potlids or granular fracture surfaces.
Transverse Fracture

A break that can be identified as the result of an ill-delivered blow to the
artifact during manufacture is called a transverse fracture. Either singly or in
combinations, a bulb of percussion, ripple marks, or radial shatter lines will
occur on some bifaces that have been broken during manufacture. The term
manufacturing break is avoided here because experimental knapping indicates
that breakage during manufacture does not necessarily produce recognizable
attributes on the fracture plane of the broken biface. To use such a term would
suggest that all manufacturing breaks can be recognized.
Snap Fracture
A smooth, clean break across the midsection ofa biface is termed a snap
fracture. The origin of such a break can be manufacturing, usage, or
accidental causes (such as dropping or trampling), and in most cases cannot
be determined. Occasionally such a fracture will have a lip or hinge on one of
the broad surfaces of the biface, usually along the medial axis, indicating that
the force causing the breakage was delivered from the opposite face of the
artifact directly through the smallest dimension of the piece. It is unlikely that
such a blow would be delivered during manufacture.
Overshot Fracture
A biface
that extends
resulting in a
platform and

can be ruined by an overshot fracture: the removal of a flake
across the breadth of the biface, over the opposing edge,
flake with remnants of the bifacial edge on both the strikingterminal ends. In some cases an overshot fracture results in the

80

Texas Archeological Society

breakage of the artifacts, and in others, an overreduction of thickness and
width so that the artifact is useless. In still other cases the artifact can be
salvaged and further processed. Overshot flaking differs from transverse
flaking in that the striking platform, location of bulb, ripple marks, and radial
shatter lines occur in the plane defined by the intersection of the length and
breadth of the artifact (that is, across the face) rather than on the cross section
of the artifact (or perpendicular to the face).
Edge Collapse
If an overshot fault in flaking can be considered an overly successful
attempt to remove a flake, edge collapse can be considered its reverse. An
edge collapse flake is one that is composed essentially of a platform area only,
with no appreciable length to its body. The effect of a single edge collapse on a
biface is a noticeable notch in the edge.

Hinge Fracture
A hinge fracture is a common error or problem in flaking. A hinge
fracture flake differs from a normal flake only in that the end of the flake
opposite the striking platform terminates in a smooth edge, which rolls back
onto the exterior surface of the flake, rather than in a sharp or feathered edge.
The result on the parent piece is a concavity or lip in the medial area of the
artifact’s surface (Crabtree 1972:68). The effect of this flaking error varies
greatly, depending upon its size and placement, and a hinge fracture can be of
little concern to the knapper. Hinge fractures can be found on finished
artifacts that are apparently perfect in shape and outline.
Knot

A knot is a lump of unremoved material that has been left on the surface
ofa biface by several hinge fractures originating from different directions, all
terminating in one spot. Thus a knot is not one flaking error, but isthe end
product of several flaking errors--unsuccessful attempts to remove material
from the surface of the biface. Knots normally occur in the medial part of a
biface, but they can occur near the edges.
Edge Crushing
Edge crushing, as the term implies, occurs when, rather than successfully
removing a flake from the surface ofa biface, the knapper crushes or shatters
the platform area, effectively blunting the edge and reducing the width of the
artifact without succeeding in reducing the thickness.
Flaw
Flaws result from circumstances that are often beyond the control of the
knapper. Very few cryptocrystalline materials are without impurities, fossil
inclusions, or fracture planes either preexistant or the by-products of
previously delivered blows to the stone. Otherwise well-struck blows can
result in the breakage of the entire piece at the point of the flaw. Occasionally
a flaw plane can be detected by a slight patina where it has weathered when a
thin fissure existed for some time. In such an instance the knapper might
recognize the flaw and abandon the project.

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

81

Unsuccessful Shaping
This problem faces all knappers, especially those who are inexperienced
and inept. Often the best efforts of the knapper fail to shape or thin the artifact
successfully, leaving it an irregular, unshaped mass. Usually such pieces will
have other errors. Failure to remove a knot is a relatively rare but
recognizable case of unsuccessful shaping. It is difficult at best to determine
that a piece is improperly shaped, because the analyst can hardly judge what
was in the mind of the prehistoric tool maker.

Methodology
A total of 386 bifacial artifacts, including all the biface fragments and
bifaces identified as being unsuccessfully shaped, were examined for the
presence or absence of various flaking problems, and these data were
recorded for each artifact (Table 10). The flaking errors were subdivided
according to the kinds of fractures, and the distribution of the unsuccessfully
shaped and discarded or aborted bifaces was tabulated. The number of
recorded problems for each category naturally exceeds the number of
artifacts in the category, since there is often more than one flaking problem on
an artifact. In addition, the number of artifacts exhibiting only fractures and
no other flaking problems is also presented. For purposes of comparison, the
figures for each cell in the display have been standardized by computing the
raw percentage of occurrence of the flaking problem.
Overshot failures were not put into the same category as transverse
fractures because they are not morphologically the same as transverse
fractures. However, they are a variety of manufacturing break, and, since they
are included among the broken bifaces, they are incorporated into this part of
the study.
Results and Interpretations
The distribution of the various kinds of flaking problems reveals certain
patterns that may be significant in the interpretation of lithic technology in
the southern Guadalupes. The category defined as abortion has the highest
proportion of knapping errors and .problems. Unsuccessful shaping (on 44
percent) and edge collapse (on 43 percent) are two of the most frequent
problems occurring on the aborted specimens. Hinge fracturing (on 39
percent) and edge crushing (on 27 percent) are also quite common. Knots are
relatively rare, but they occur more than four times as frequently on aborted
bifaces as on fractured bifaces of either type. The unsuccessful flaking
category is an end result of combinations of other flaking errors, especially
edge collapse, hinge fractures, knots, and edge crushing, and as such it is not a
truly independent variable. Knots in particular are produced by a variety of
flaking errors. Furthermore, continued edge collapsing, hinge fracturing, and
edge crushing make bifaces increasingly difficult to flake effectively. Flaws
are relatively rare in aborted bifaces.
Aborted bifaces are most likely to have both a variety and a high
frequency of flaking errors, which illustrate in large part the major reasons for
discard. They were inappropriately shaped for either further flaking or use.

The snap and transverse biface fragments have both similarities and
differences. In some categories, the percentages of flaking errors are close, if
not virtually equal. Edge collapse and edge crushing differ by 2 percent or less
when transverse and snap fractures are compared. The frequency of knots is
very low--only four in 310 fragmentary specimens--and the significance of
the similarity or difference is questionable. The same is also true of flaws.
However, hinge fracturing and unsuccessful shaping do appear to vary
significantly. Hinge fractures occur on 35 percent of the transverse biface
fragments and on 26 percent of the snap fractures. In addition, 22 percent of
the transverse fracture bifaces and 16 percent of the snap fractures were
defined as unsuccessfully shaped. Thus artifacts that were broken, presumably
during manufacture, seem to have more problems with hinge fracturing and,
as a result, a somewhat higher frequency of unsuccessful shaping. The further
fracturing of the bifaces may have resulted from unsuccessful attempts to
correct the problems arising from the hinge fractures and unsuccessful
shaping of the artifact.
The most significant variable found in comparing the transverse and
snap fractures is the frequency of specimens with no apparent errors or
problems other than the fracture. Only 20 percent of the transverse fractures
fall into this category, but the fracture is the only problem in 46 percent of the
snap fractures. This indicates that there is significant difference between the
two groups in distribution of flaking problems.
The most probable explanation is that the snap fracture category
includes not only the completed and perfect, or nearly perfect, bifaces that
have been snapped by lateral stress, but also bifaces broken during
manufacture, which do not have the characteristic attributes of transverse
fractures. This would result in an assemblage of artifacts with similar kinds of
fracture planes across their midsections and a distribution of flaking
problems suggestive of both well-flaked and finished forms broken after
completion of flaking, and forms broken during manufacture. Replicative
experiments demonstrate that bifaces broken in manufacture can have the
attributes of snap fracture.
Analysis of the biface fragments and aborted bifaces from the southern
Guadalupe Mountains and adjacent desert has revealed a patterned distribution of flaking errors and problems. Biface fragments with transverse
fractures had a higher frequency of flaking problems, with hinge fractures and
unsuccessful shaping particularly common, than did the snap fractured
bifaces. Aborted bifaces, as expected, also had a high frequency of flaking
problems. This overall pattern suggests that there may be even more
patterning of flaking errors that might be recognized in larger collections and
in collections with better contextual information. These patterns could be
related to the kinds of material used, intended form of the artifacts, or the
knapping tradition used by the tool maker.
Summary and Conclusions
Within the limits of accuracy of the interpretations of the flake clusters
set forth above, it is possible to isolate some specific activities that went on at
sites in the survey area. It is apparent that the process of manufacturing

84

Texas Archeological Society

chipped stone tools, particularly bifaces, was not continuous. Segments of the
process are evident at different sites. More comprehensive studies of the
region may reveal patterns of chippage distribution that suggest movement
among the sites.
In addition, it is possible to isolate stages in the reductive process.
Replicative experiments can generate data concerning knapping behavior
and tangible by-products that are applicable to the archeological data base,
with tremendous implications for the study of lithic technology and
archeology. We can now isolate with some precision certain activities relating
to the manufacture of chipped stone tools. Since it is rare that chippage debris
is transported great distance from the point of production, we can pinpoint
the locations of these activities. Analysis of chippage debris, in conjunction
with other archeological data, greatly increases the potential for describing
and, it is hoped, explaining the mechanisms of stone knapping behavior.
Two conclusions can be reached from this study of biface fragments and
aborted bifaces. First, the categorization of the three basic groups, snap
fractures, transverse fractures, and aborted bifaces, is accurate and meaningful. Aborted bifaces have a very high percentage of flaking problems, which
seem to combine to make the bifaces either unworkable or unusable. Second,
there is a difference between the transverse and snap fractured bifaces, not so
much in the relative percentage of flaking problems observed as in their
distribution.
THE IMPLEMENTS

Methodology
The objective of this section is to isolate meaningful groups of artifacts,
with the goal of defining both their functional and temporal significance. To
do this, the HCLUS clustering program was again used, but the ever-present
problem of differential sample size was compounded by the fact that many
artifact types were rare, and missing data were quite common, even on sites
with large artifact assemblages. Consequently, the cluster analysis of this data
has met with only limited success.
The Data

The data input consisted of implement frequencies from the sites
surveyed by the TAS. In many cases the site inventories were extremely small
or nonexistent, especially when the debitage and preforms were removed. An
arbitrary cutoff of seven artifacts was established, and sites with biased
samples, as determined by the same criteria used for the sites in the debitage
analysis, were withdrawn. The correspondence between the two groups of
sites is close, with a few additional sites unique to each analysis. (Artifact
frequencies for all sites are tabulated in Boisvert 1980:Appendix 2.)
Analysis and Interpretation, the Artifacts
The artifact clusters were generated (Figures 32 and 33) both with and
without standardizing each case (artifact class). In all runs, each variable (site)
was standardized. Standardization in both situations was accomplished by

The clustering of artifacts was not much altered by the standardization of
cases, although some improvement of cluster definition was apparent. The
basic problem evident in both versions of HCLUS with this data set was the
many instances of missing data. The artifact cluster based upon raw
frequency shows an unmistakable skew toward artifact classes with larger
frequencies (especially implement fragments and some types of unifaces).
Some redefinition was achieved by standardizing the size of the artifact
classes, but the same basic patterns prevailed.

Some of the lower order mergings remained the same. Type I unifaces
merged with ovate bifaces: Types IVb and IVc unifaces retained their close
association, as did marginal bifaces and convex manos. Two projectile styles,
Types 8 and 9, continued to show a close association. This is most interesting,
since both fall into Johnson’s Group H points.
One cluster seems to be especially significant, the grouping of battered
stone, flat manos, tabular limestone bifaces, and metate fragments. This
cluster may represent an activity set or a functionally related group of
implements. The mano and metate indicate plant grinding activity, but the
function of the tabular limestone bifaces is conjectural. The battered stones

may have been used to produce the tabular limestone bifaces.
There is also a significant distribution of sites with artifacts from this
cluster in terms of their spatial distribution. Table 11 lists the sites on which
were found one or more artifacts from the cluster. Figure 34 shows their
distribution within the park. Of the 32 sites, 26 are in the Lower Sonoran arid
division of the lower Austral life zone; 5 are in the Upper Sonoran, and 1 is in
the Transition zone. One site, CU68, is at the lower edge of the Upper

Sonoran life zone and could conceivably be included in the Lower. The
boundary definition of these zones is arbitrarily tied to elevations and
fluctuates somewhat. If this association of the artifact cluster is indeed related
to the processing of plants, this correlation with the Lower Sonoran zone
suggests that this is an area where such plants could be found.
There are also indications of temporal significance for this cluster. Using
the presence or absence of ceramics on these sites and the probable age of the
ceramic assemblages with reasonable numbers of potsherds, a fairly late date
is inferred for the artifacts (Table 11). There is a definite loading for
intermediate and late ceramic sites. Other typologically late artifacts are
found in loose association with this group. All five sites where Livermore
projectile points were found also contain artifacts from the cluster. The
frequency of projectile points in the Guadalupes is low (due in part to the
activities of relic collectors), making it unlikely that they would cluster with
many other artifacts.
The flat manos, metates, tabular limestone bifaces, and battered stones
seem to represent tool kits or activity sets used fairly late in the prehistoric

occupation of the Guadalupe Mountains. They were found predominantly on
the south and west flanks of the mountains in the Lower Sonoran zone. If they
were associated with the exploitation of plants from this zone, identification
of the plants should shed light on some aspects of subsistence and possibly
settlement patterns.
A closer look at the other distinctive clusters in the dendrograms makes it
clear that they are made up of the most ubiquitous and least typologically
specialized artifacts in the collections. This is most evident in the cluster
produced through standardization by case. Here all of the implement
fragments--the two kinds of biface fragments and uniface fragments--are
clustered together, and the three most frequent uniface types (IVa, V, and VI)
are also clustered together. These artifact forms are widespread both in time
and space, so no temporal significance can be attached to them.

Analysis and Interpretations, the Site Clustering

disappointing. The dendrograms in Figures 35 and 36 were generated using

both standardized and nonstandardized data and reveal a significant
skewing, which can be attributed to sample sizes. The eight sites with the
largest inventories (CU18, CUI9, CU31, CU43, CU83, CU96, HZ52, and
HZ68) are grouped together in both dendrograms. All of the other sites merge
at a very low order, due to the common lack of artifacts in most categories.
There is one subcluster consisting of the essentially aceramic sites CU31,
CU43, and CU83 (Figure 37) that might have some significance. The sites
have proportionately large numbers of unifaces, especially Type V unifaces.
Sites CU31 and CU43 have ring middens, and the debitage analysis indicates
that CU83 is a lithic workshop.
These three sites may represent primarily Archaic occupations in the
southern Guadalupes. Types 7, 8, and 9 projectile points, which resemble
Johnson’s Type H Archaic points, and a Meserve point were found at CU31,
and Type 10 (Shumla point) was found at CU43. These sites are also near

Bone springs (CU83). If they were habitation sites that were used repeatedly,
that would explain the high proportion of unifaces if the unifaces were
assumed to be scrapers associated with domestic activities.
The results of the implement analysis are not as extensive as are the
results of the debitage analysis, but one possible activity set that may have
temporal and spatial significance has been tentatively isolated. In addition,
one small group of sites that may be Archaic base camps has been tentatively
defined. However, the goal of isolating well-defined clusters of sites that cover
a spectrum of temporal and spatial variation has not been attained, mainly
because the methodology applied was not compatible with the data at hand.
The sample (case) sizes were too small to produce meaningful clusters, and it
is unlikely that additional manipulation of the data by combining artifact
categories and increasing minimum sample size would result in any significant
improvement. The collection acquired by the TAS survey is not large enough
to permit a comprehensive understanding of the cultural and historical
sequence in Guadalupe Mountains National Park.

CONCLUSIONS

The analysis of the lithic assemblages recovered by the TAS survey in
Guadalupe Mountains National Park was aimed at determining what lithic
technologies were practiced there and interpreting their meaning in terms of
the culture history of that region. Although it has not been possible to wring
this information from the data with the research methods at hand, several
conclusions can be drawn.
The best-quality materials, that is, the fine-grained silicates such as chert,
were most frequently used to produce morphologically complex bifaces,
especially projectile points and drills. These materials were also used for other
artifacts, but less frequently.
The local limestones are ubiquitous in the park and may have some
degree of conchoidal fracture. They were used primarily for simple tools by
the prehistoric inhabitants. The bulk of the limestone artifacts were unifacial
forms, presumably scrapers, and indeed some limestone flakes that were used
for resharpening unifaces have been identified in the collection. Among the
bifaces produced from limestone were the morphologically unique, if not
overly complex, tabular limestone bifaces. When they are found unbroken
they are relatively large and subtriangular.
Cherty limestone occupies a curious position in the lithic inventory of the
southern Guadalupe Mountains. Occurring with frequency at only a few sites,
it has qualities of both chert and limestone, as the name implies. Not only was
it used in a manner somewhat similar to both, but its reaction to flaking, as
demonstrated by the flake analysis, is also intermediate between chert and
limestone.
Quartzite was used to make two fundamentally different kinds of tools.
On the one hand, it was used for the manufacture of manos and metates,
presumably because of its durability, convenient size, shape, and availability.
On the other hand, it was chosen for flake knives, often similar in form to Old
World blades.
Greenstone was quickly isolated in the collection, but, in spite of its
abundance, it does not seem to have been heavily used. Analysis of the
greenstone debitage revealed that it had an exceptionally high proportion of
broken platforms,, which must reflect failed attempts to shape it into usable
implements.
The choice of raw materials by the prehistoric flint knappers of the
Guadalupes can be viewed as a balance between convenient and abundant
local sources (limestone, quartzite, and possibly cherty limestone) and highquality chippable stones (exotic silicates and imported cherts), which were
apparently less abundant and were probably imported. When morphological
complexity was desired, the higher-quality materials were used almost
exclusively; when less complexity was desired, a much wider variety of
materials was utilized. However, it should not be assumed that chert was an
exceptionally scarce resource, for it was frequently used for simple tools that
could easily have been made from other materials. For certain implements,
local materials were apparently deemed most appropriate, either because of
their basic nature (hardness and texture for groundstone tools) or because of
natural shapes that facilitated manufacture of particular implements (tabular
limestone for specialized bifaces and blocky quartzite for blades). Greenstone,

Boisvert-- Guadalupe Mountains

93

which seems at first glance to have great potential, was generally avoided by
knappers.
The difference in sample sizes and a dearth of sites with large artifact
assemblages hindered analysis of the artifact clusters, but one group of artifacts-tabular limestone bifaces, flat manos, metates, and battered stones-seem to have both temporal and ecological significance. These artifacts mostly
come from the late ceramic period identified by Phelps (1974) as from A.D.
1200 to 1350, and they are found in the Lower Sonoran zone. The functions
and interrelations of this group of artifacts should be an avenue for future
research in this region. They may represent activity sets or tool kits for
particular activities. It is also possible that the people who used these
implements were carrying out a variety of essentially unrelated activities, and
that this assemblage contains an unrelated set of artifacts from the material
culture of a particular group or groups of people. The mano and metate are
obviously related, but the interrelationship of the tabular limestone bifaces
and the battered stone is not clear.
The place of agriculture in the southern Guadalupes is still an open
question. Several sites in the Lower Sonoran arid division, especially along
the west flank of the mountains, have many ceramics and food grinding tools,
but livestock management practices have significantly altered the availability
of water in the region, and it is difficult to determine if sufficient moisture was
present to support the cultivation of maize, squash, or beans. Evidence from
the H ot Well site about 160 km ( 100 miles) to the west (Schultz 1966) indicates
that the area might have supported agriculture. The association of the tool kit
with the sites in the Guadalupes isolated by the clustering analysis remains an
intriguing problem.
Analysis of the projectile points suggests a fairly long occupation
extending from late Paleo-Indian times into Late Prehistoric times. Continuity
with the historic tribes of Jumano and Apache cannot be demonstrated from
the TAS collections, but the Trans-Pecos seems to follow the previously
defined culture history sequence in West Texas and southern New Mexico.
The TAS collection, insofar as the projectile point typologies are accurate and
meaningful, contains no particular surprises; indeed the varieties of projectile
points are just what would be expected in the Guadalupes.
It had been hoped that analysis of the debitage recovered by the TAS
survey would identify the techniques used in manufacturing stone implements
in the Guadalupes, but the limited size of the data base and the nature of the
collection caused serious problems. Many sites that were reported as having
large amounts of lithic material were undercollected; in other instances
collections were biased, making the samples from those sites unsuitable for
analysis, and many of the sites produced samples that were too small for
analysis. Furthermore, the fact that many sites obviously had several
components made intersite comparisons difficult to interpret.
Analysis of the chippage reveals that seemingly similar kinds of flakes,
when subjected to attribute analysis and hierarchical groupings, fall into
constellations of flake forms that may be indicative of the production of
bifaces or unifaces. Although biface and uniface production in the early
stages can produce quite similar chippage, the results of this study suggest
that it may be possible to distinguish between the two activities.

94

Texas Archeological Society

That implements were being produced in quantity in the Guadalupes is
evidenced not only by the chippage recovered, but also by recovery of
partially finished bifaces in both whole and broken (during manufacture)
states. With one possible exception, no sites were identified as loci of activities
at or near natural sources of raw material. This is in part a result of the limited
area of the TAS survey, an area that does not have substantial chert-bearing
deposits, although chert deposits are indeed available in the southern
Guadalupes of New Mexico.
As with most scientific endeavors, more questions have been raised than
answered in this study, and unsuspected pieces of information surfaced while
specifically selected problems remained unsolved. Perhaps the most significant
conclusions to be drawn from this study lie in the area of the analytical
techniques applied--specifically their utility and limitations. The flake study,
based upon an attribute analysis, identified at least some aspects of chipped
stone tool manufacture. The fact that specific stages in the reduction of lithic
material can be isolated has implications for identification of lithic technologies as practiced by different groups during different cultural-temporal
periods, and might even provide some information as to the nature of
prehistoric transhumance patterns. In addition, it may be possible to identify
the manufacturing debris from different kinds of artifacts. Although such
determinations are now only crude and are limited to unifaces and thinned
bifaces, the potential exists to further refine the techniques.
In line with the suggestions offered above, it is apparent that hierarchical
clustering, such as HCLUS, is useful for eliciting natural groupings of
artifacts and sites. However, it is severely limited by the constraints of smal!
sample size and samples with a high proportion of missing data. When used
with caution and finesse it can be very helpful.
The IFREQ package, in conjunction with HCLUS, has great potential for
investigating variation and patterns in chippage assemblages. The scope of
attribute analysis is now limited only by the imagination of the lithic analyst
and the capabilities of the computing apparatus. Indeed, other areas of
research such as ceramics, folk taxonomies, folklore, and even descriptive
linguistics might find useful the techniques presented in this study.
As a result of this study we now know something of the techniques and
choices exercised by the prehistoric flint knappers of the Guadalupe
Mountains of Texas. Intriguing bits of information have been brought to
light and presented, if not as answers to great problems, at least as suggestions
that may lead to a greater understanding of the region.

APPENDIX

Morphology

This Appendix describes the various morphological characteristics defined and
used for analysis o~" the flakes. The system employed is an adaptation of the one used
by M.B. Collins (1975:161-172) in his analysis of debitage from sites in Texas and
southwestern France. Five categories, or attribute states, were defined and incorporated into a coding scheme. These attributes are platform, bulb, body, length, and
material type.

Boisvert--Guadalupe Mountains

95

The changes from Collins’ system are the substitution of a new set of material
types and the elimination of any distinction between blades and flakes. Each of the
attribute states is given its own code (see Table 4).
Platform
Platforms are defined in terms of two aspects, shape and surface treatment, with a
total of 15 states (see Table 4). Collins defines the platform variable as follows:
Basically, platforms were either straight or recurved when viewed from the top. Each of
these shapes, plus any miscellaneous shapes which might be observed, could be placed in
one of four categories of degree of treatment: cortex remaining, single-faceted, doublefaceted, and multi-faceted. Also noted were those platforms which were either shattered,
broken, or ground. A given platform, then, could be described as "straight, singlefaceted," or "straight, cortex," etc. Coding standards for these variables were as follows:
the recurvate platform shape, designated "sequent,~’ refers to the shallow, U-shaped
platform which results from the sequent removal of a flake directly in line with the
negative scar left by the removal of a former flake. When the platform is viewed from
above, the edge which intersects the exterior of the flake exhibits an inward curve caused
by the concavity of the previous negative bulb; the opposite edge curves outward--usually
strongly--with the positive bulb of the flake. The category "straight" includes all platform
shapes that are rectanguloid or biconvex. A third category, "other," was used to designate
platforms whose shape was neither "straight" nor "sequent," such as triangular. Cortex
platforms are those which retain the weathered surface of the raw material and indicate
that no preparation of that surface was made prior to flake removal, lfthe platform has
been altered by flaking, it may be described as exhibiting one, two, or more facets. These
do not necessarily indicate the number of facets produced in preparation of the platform,
but they do indicate the nature of the surface area to which force was applied. For
example, in experiments the gable-like intersection of two facets is often found to be an
advantageous point for the application of force. Shattered platforms are those whose
position is observable, but whose form is not (due to crushing or shattering under the force
which removed the flake). Broken platforms are similar in that the position of the
platform can be determined, but its form is not observable due to breakage (presumably
after removal). These two categories are not to be confused with the "broken flake"
category which includes flakes with the platform or another edge completely missing.
Ground platforms are generally small and "straight" (usually biconvex) with striations
across most of the surface. Although these are generally considered to be intentionally
ground in platform preparation, the possibility that some represent use wear cannot be
overlooked [Collins 1975:161-165].

See Figure 38 for illustration of platform characteristics.
Bulb
Bulbs are classified according to three attribute states: normal, exuberant, and
flat. Collins defines the bulb category as follows:
Under "normal" are recorded flakes which exhibit a bulb of percussion of average
properties, i.e., noticeable but not greatly protuberant. "Exuberant" bulbs are those
which protrude strongly and are decidedly rounded when viewed either from the side
(perpendicular to the axis of flaking) or from either end (parallel to the flaking axis)
[Collins 1975:165].

See Figure 39 for bulb characteristics.
Body
The body attribute category encompasses two aspects, the nature and extent of
cortex on the flake exterior and the shape of the flake in cross section. Sixteen body
states are defined by Collins as follows:

Primary cortex flakes exhibit cortex over the entire exterior and along any edges which
are not the sharp intersection between the interior and exterior surfaces. Secondary cortex
flakes have cortex on greater than 10 percent of their exterior and may or may not have
cortex on any edges. Secondary edge cortex flakes have cortex only along one or more
edges, and noncortex flakes lack cortex (or exhibit small patches on less than 10 percent of
their exterior). The shape categories are relative. Thin flakes are relatively very thin to
length and width, medium ones are intermediate in this regard, and thick ones are
relatively thick. Flakes which are thick and have facets on their exterior surface which
intersect in an acute angle are recorded as "angular" [Collins 1975:167].

See Figure 40 for illustrations of cortex characteristics.
Length
The length variable was expressed as a discontinuous variable represented by five
classes. The length was measured by obtaining the maximum length of the flake
perpendicular to the striking platform. The lengths defined are as follows: (1) very
small, less than 12 mm; (2) small, 12 to 25 mm; (3) medium, 26 to 50 ram; (4) large, 51 to
100 mm; and (5) very large, more than 100 mm (Collins 1975:169).
Material Type
The material-type variable incorporates the six types defined in the section on
stone type analysis. Originally, seven types were. defined, including two varieties of
limestone. However, after the coding was initiated these two types were combined.
Instead of reassigning variable state labels, it was decided simply to combine all
limestone under one code number, leaving the other unused.
Each flake in the collection, unless it came from a random surface find, was
analyzed according to the five variable states. Site provenience and the attribute state
code were recorded on Fortran coding sheets, then keypunched onto cards. These
cards provided the basic data, which were processed by the IFREQ and HCLUS
programs.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This report would not have been completed if it were not for the support and
assistance which 1 have received from many different quearters, and it is to these
people that I wish to extend my most sincere thanks and appreciation. First among
those who should be recognized are the members of the Texas Archeological Society
who, in the summer of 1970, conducted a survey of Guadalupe Mountains National
Park and thus brought together the data that is the focus of this report. Their hard
work and diligence is clearly reflected in their copious field notes. Special appreciation
is due Harry Shafer, who supervised the survey and who graciously allowed me to use
part of the project data. I would like to express my thanks to the University of
Kentucky Graduate School, which provided funds to defer travel and subsistence
expenses, thus allowing me to travel to the Guadalupe Mountains and conduct my
survey oflithic resources. My thanks also go to Roger Reich, park ranger, who offered
his advice and assistance to this desert novice during that survey.
The excitement that can be obtained from conducting archeological fieldwork is
exceeded only by the tedium that must be endured if anything resembling science is to
be obtained from it. Two individuals stand out as ones who shared in that trial and
without whose help completion of this report would have been vastly more difficult.
Dolores DeCorsey assisted in the coding of flake attributes and relieved me of the task
of coding about a third of the assemblage. Carol Straus went far beyond her normal
responsibilities as a consultant at the University of Kentucky Computing Center and
spent seemingly endless hours, over a period of several months, to bring order out of

the chaos of programs. I am deeply indebted to her for for making it possible to utilize
the cluster program upon which I have so heavily depended. I also wish to extend my
thanks to Don Graybill, who provided me with the clustering program, and to the
University of Kentucky Department of Anthropology, which acquired the necessary
computer time for me to carry out my research. I am also grateful to Virginia Slattery,
who not only typed the manuscript but also caught and corrected many small errors
and inconsistencies, thus saving me a tremendous amount of time and worry.
I am sincerely grateful to the members of my thesis committee: to Eugenic Scott
for her contributions in the area of statistical application of computers; to Lathel
Duffield for his insightful criticisms and appraisal of my methodology and findings;
and especially to Michael Collins, chairman, who has guided me through the maze of
problems that beset me in my attempt to use lithic technological data in order to
understand the behavior behind artifacts. To the extent that this goal has been
obtained, Michae! Collins shares in the achievement.
Without question this report is as much an accomplishment of my wife Deborah
as it is mine. She has patiently endured countless lonely nights as I conducted the
analysis and writeup, and she actively encouraged and motivated me to continue when
it would have been easier for me to quietly abandon efforts.
