1.0 DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA

This report details the results of the monitoring conducted during the soil scrapings
conducted at the historic Second City Cemetery, in Houston Texas. The Houston Fire
Department (HFD) hired Perennial Environmental Services, now Gulf Coast
Archaeology Group (GCA Group), to monitor soil scrapings conducted at the cemetery.
The soil scrapings were conducted in order to find an empty plot where previously
recovered human remains from the Second City Cemetery were to be re-interred. The
soil scrapings were conducted with a gradall.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is located north of Downtown Houston (Figure 1).
Houston is located within Harris County, Texas. The soils in the project area have been
classified as Urban Land (Wheeler 1976). The classification of these soils is not based
on taxonomic characteristics, but is used on soils that have been heavily disturbed
through historical land use. This land use has caused the soils to lose their original
characteristics.
The APE is approximately 45 meters (147.73 feet) long and approximately 10 meters
(32.80 feet) wide. The Study Area consists of a small grassy area within a paved
parking lot located in a Houston Fire Department facility. Historically, potential animal
resources included deer, squirrels, raccoons, opossum, rabbits, skunks, and gophers.
Aquatic resources included freshwater mussels and snails, alligators, different species
of fish, turtles, and snakes.

Also, bison, deer, and antelope would have been

occasionally exploited by people in the area.

2.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Gulf Coast Archaeology Group (GCA Group) conducted the monitoring of the soil
scrapings for the Houston Fire Department.

The monitoring was conducted to: a)

locate an empty plot for the re-interment of human remains; b) avoid disturbing existing
human remains within the Area of Potential Effect (APE); and c) to make
recommendations based on the findings of the soil scrapings where to re-interred the
human remains. These activities are part conducted under legislation, which includes
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended in 1981, and the
regulations (36 CFR 800) of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
Report write-up was conducted under the supervision of principal investigator Mr. Jorge
Garcia-Herreros, RPA, and Anna Enderli Pokluda, osteologist. The monitoring of the
Second City Cemetery soil scrapings was conducted by Mr. Jorge Garcia-Herreros and
Anna Enderli Pokluda, with the assistance of Mark Denton of the Texas Historical
Commission on March 22 and 23, 2006.

3.0 RESEARCH DESIGN

The proposed research design entails monitoring the soil scrapings at the Second City
Cemetery located in 1205 Dart Street, Houston, Texas. The monitoring tried to identify
any vacant plots within the cemetery. If any vacant plots are identified these plots will
be flagged. These scrapings will be conducted by heavy equipment provided by Public
Works. Any necessary mapping was performed by Planning and Development.
During the monitoring and in the event that any human remains are unintentionally
uncovered an osteologist will be present to identify the remains. The research design
does not include the excavation or curation of any cultural or human remains. In the
event that cultural or human are unintentionally were uncovered during the scrapping in
the cemetery the Houston Fire Department and the Texas Historical Commission would
be consulted.
The soil scrapings attempted to remove approximately 15 to 30 cm of top soil in order
to identify any possible grave shafts. Due to the possible disturbance of the top soil at
the cemetery it might be necessary to remove more than 30 cm of top soil. The soil
scrapings will not be excavated below a depth of 60 cmbgs, excavating any deeper
than 60 cm might intrude upon extant burials.

4.0 RESULTS

The Area of Potential Effect (APE) monitored by GCA Group is located within the
historic Second City Cemetery, which is now part of the Houston Fire Department
maintenance facility in Houston, Texas.

Monitoring of the Area of Potential Effect

(APE) was surveyed on March 22 and 23, 2006.

The APE was a small grassy area

maintained by the HFD. This grassy area is in the parking lot of the HFD maintenance
facility (Plate 1). A grave marker was located on the grassy area commemorating some
of the men buried in the cemetery (Plate 2).
Soil scrapings were conducted with a gradall (Plate 3). Soil scrapings attempted to
remove approximately 15 to 30 cm of top soil in order to identify any possible grave
shafts. The soil was removed gradually due to the possibility to disturb existing human
remains. Approximately 50 cm of top soil was removed when grave shafts were started
to be identified. The soil scrapings successfully indentified an empty plot where the
recovered human remains could be re-interred. No graves or human remains were
impacted during the excavations.

5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

The soil scrapings successfully indentified an empty plot where the recovered human
remains could be re-interred. It is recommended that no other areas be disturbed since
there is a very high probability of uncovering human remains. It is recommended that if
the proposed area is expanded or moved that it be monitored in order to prevent
disturbing any existing graves. Should any graves or features be exposed during the
re-interment, activities should cease within the immediate area and the Texas Historical
Commission should be contacted immediately.
