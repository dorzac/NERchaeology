INTRODUCTION
This report embodies the results of additional archeological
resource assessments in the Sanderson Canyon Watershed Project
area, Terrell County, Texas.
The assessments of archeological
res~urces at Floodwater Retarding Structures 8, 9, and 11 located
in Threemile Draw or its tributaries were carr~ed ou~ by the Texas
Archeological Survey under the provisions of a purchase order
issued by the Soil Conservation Service, U.S.D.A., Temple, Texas.
A total of 20 working days were spent examining, recording, and
evaluating the archeological resources at Floodwater Retarding
Strucutres 8, 9, and 11 during the month of April, 1976.
The assessments implemented the minimum recommendations
submitted to the Soil Conservation Service by th. Texas Archeo­
logical Survey in 1971*. They were specifically directed toward
determining the eligibility of each archeological site to be
affected by the project to be nominated to the National Register
of Historic Places.
In accordance with the Soil Conservation
Service request, this report contains a suggested program of
mitigation for those sites considered eligible for nomination
to the Register.
A cost estimate for implementing the suggested
program accompanies this report with the transmittal letter.
All notes, maps, photographs, and other documents accumulated
during this assessment are housed at the Texas Archeological
Survey facilities at the Balcones Research Center, The University
of Texas at Austin.
All artifacts collected from Structures 8
and 9 (none were collected at Structure 11) will be temporarily
retained at Balcones Research Center, The University of Texas at
Austin, pending completion of archeological investigations in
the project area.
David S. Dibble served as prinCipal investigator, Elton R.
Prewitt as the supervising archeologist, and Kenneth M. Brown as
assistant archeologist in direct control of day-to-day field
operations. Preparation of the report has been shared by Brown
and Prewitt with frequent contributions from Dibble.

The Authors would like-to thank the Soil Conservation
Service for their financial support as well as the pleasant
cooperation of Jim Warren, State SCS Archeologist, and Larry
Seymour, SCS Agent at Sanderson. Particular appr~ciation is
expressed to Charles R. Downie for permission to conduct
the investigations on his properties. The SCS arranged for
access to those properties not owned by Mr. Downie. Pat Harris,
Admiral in the Texas Navy, is thanked for the warm hospitality
extended to the crew during our stay in Sanderson. The field
crew, Douglas B. Comstock and Robert F. Scott, IV, dispatched
their duties in a professional manner.

ASSESSMENT AT FLOODWATER RETARDING
STRUCTURES 8, 9, and 11
The actual amount of time allotted to the assessment of
the resources at each of the three floodwater retarding
structures varied according to the quantity of the archeological
remains present at each one. A majority of the assessment time
was spent at the site of Structure 9.
Each structure is dis­
cussed individually in this section; the archeological resources
located within each are described briefly, the work accomplished
during the assessment is outlined, and an evaluation is pre­
sented for the individual archeological sites to be affected.

('"~\k) ~L1-'Z: 1(;, S

Two archeological sites were reported to be endangered by
this structure - 41 TE 58 and 41 TE 61. The first site, 41 TE
58, consists of two crescent middens and associated remains
near the upper portion of the detention pool. The second
sit., 41 TE 61, is a chert quarry with associated stone fire
hearths along the centerline of the dam axis and in the sediment
pool. 41 TE 58 was found to lie outside the limits of the
detention pool easement and was dismissed from consideration
since it should not be affected by construction of the flood­
water retarding structure. A third site w~s discovered during
the course of the assessment; this site, 41 TE 105, is situated
marginal to the upper end of the detention pool and should not .
be affected by the project.
It was dismissed from consideration
for the same reasons as 41 TE 58. .
Site 41 TE 61 includes three distinct concentrations of
prehistoric debris and will be more fully discussed.

.Site 41 TE 61. Area A
Description: Area A is an aboriginal chert quarry at
least 50 x 50 m. in size covering the surface of the ridge at
the north end of the dam and is in the area to be affected by
the spillway. Only the portion within the spillway easement
was investigated. This part of the site consists of a heavy
scatter of naturally fractured nodular and tabular chert inter­
spersed with aboriginal chipping debris and occasional partially
completed artifacts.
Work done by the Survey: Two intersecting transects of
collection points at 15 m. intervals were established and
centered on SCS survey stake 9+50. At each point all chipping
debris was collected from the surface in a circular area 10
sq. m. in size, giving a total of 12 surface collection quad­
rats.
In addition, a number of individual artifacts were
plotted and collected from the surface, especially on the eastern
and southeastern slope of the ridge.
Evaluation: This area of the site is not recommended for
nomination to the National Register because of its limited
information potential~ and because similar sites ar. known to
exist outside the affected area.
Site 41 TE 61, Area B
Description: Area B consists of a cluster of 15 aboriginal
hearths bisected by the dam centerline and covers an area about
120 x 140 m. Other hearths in this cluster are located to the
east along the margin of the arroyo but are believed to lie be­
yond the dam easement. Artifacts and chipping debris are exposed
on the surface in and around the hearth cluster.
Work done by the Survey: A flat plan of the hearths
No.1) was prepared and some artifacts were plotted and
collected from the surface. A brief description and sketch of
each hearth was recorded. One of the hearths (84) was sectioned
to determine whether it was intact (Fig. 3). It proved to be
virtually undisturbed and a good sample of wood charcoal was
collected for
l~C dating (Figs. 4,5).
Some artifacts exposed
on the surface in Area B were plotted on the plan, individually
numbered, and collected.
(Sh~et

Evaluation: Area B has sufficient potential for archeo­
logical data recovery to warrant nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places. Six of the 15 hearths appear to

I

L

4
be well enough preserved to provide some information about
hearth construction and, possibly, function as well as age (if
charcoal is present).
The cross section of hearth #4 shows
that hearths lying in these alluvial flats are likely to be
undisturbed except where recent gullying or sheetwashing has
obviously disrupted them.
In addition, the scatter of discarded
artifacts and chipping debris around the hearths may yield
information on aboriginal use of the hearths and surrounding
areas.
Site 41 TE 61, Area C
Description:
Area C is another cluster of 12 aboriginal
hearths on the alluvial flats, scattered along the north bank
of the arroyo and bisected by grid line 'F'. with an associated
scatter of artifacts and chipping debris, about 30 x 120 m. in
size.
Work done by the Survey:
A flat plan was prepared and a
limited surface collection was made as at Area B. None of the
hearths in this cluster was sectioned.
Evaluation:
Six of the hearths in this cluster are rela­
tively intact and may yield data complementary to those from
Area B.
Area C is considered to be eligible for nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places.
Floodwater Retarding Structure 9
Ten archeological sites were reported in and around the
location of this structure.
Four of them, 41 TE 49, 41 TE 51,
41 TE 52 and 41 TE 57, are marginal to the project limits.
41 TE 49 (a small rockshelter) is partially within the easement
on the north end of the dam axis; however, the site should not
be affected by construction.
41 TE 51 is a crescent midden­
hearth-artifact scatter complex situated just outside the limits
of the emergency spillway on the south end of the dam axis. This
is a well preserved example of this type of site and a special
note about it should be inserted here.
While the site is indis­
putably outside the easement for the project, it is quite notice­
able and vulnerable to the depredations of relic collectors- however
casual or innocent the act of artifact collecting may seem.
This
site is considered to be important and, since its surface expres­
sion is fragile in nature, we recommend that stringent measures
be taken to insure that absolutely no pedestrian or vehicular
traffic be allowed on this site during the construction or
maintenance of ilia floodwater retarding structure.

5

41 TE 52, a quarry site, is located outside the easement
and overlooks the emergency spillway.
This site was dismissed
from consideration since it is outside the limits of the project.
Although site 41 TE 57 was originally reported to be outside
the limits of the project, the current assessment was extended
to include it since it appears the site may be barely within the
margins of the detention pool.
This small scatter of fire­
cracked rock and chipping debris is of particular interest since
it is the only site known in the juniper covered taZus fan
habitat on the west side of the valley, and cursory inspection
of surface debris suggests it may have played a role in the pre­
historic settlement system that differs from all the other sites
dealt with here.
If indeed it is within the limits of the
detention pool, then this site should be considered eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
The remaining six sites, 41 TE 48, 41 TE 50, 41 TE 53, 41
TE 54, 41 TE 55, and 51 TE 56, are within the dam axis and/or
the sediment pool limits.
Site 41 TE 48
Description:
This site is located at the northeast end
of the dam, mainly on the lower part of the talus slope. About
one third of the site lies north of the dam centerline, the rest
south of it (see Sheet No.2).
There are four major parts of
the site, which may be primarily an aboriginal plant processing
station:
(1) a very well preserved crescent-shaped midden of
fire-fractured limestone and ashy soil located about 17 m.
southeast of the centerline at an elevation of about 2,914 feet
MSL.
This midden probably represents debris from periodic
cleaning of a central earth oven.
It is about 8 x 12 m. across,
about 1-1/2 m. ,high arid with a small pile of limestone fragments
(about 3 m. across) opposite the concave side; (2) an outcrop of
naturally concave limestone slabs about 15 m. ,upslope (east­
northeast) from the midden, at least 6 of which have been
expediently used as bedrock grinding stones or mortars; (3) a
discrete cluster of artifacts and chipping debris downslope from
a group of large limestone boulders on the slope about 35m.
north of the midden; (4) a group of 4 hearths located on the
first terrace above the present arroyo floodplain, at the foot
of the talus slope and southeast of the midden.
There is also a scatter of artifacts and chipping debris
around the midden, bedrock mortars, and hearths. The entire
site covers an area roughly 50 x 100 m. across at an elevation
of about 2,911 to 2,922 feet MSL.

----------------~.----.

6
Work done by the Survey: A topographic contour map of
the site was prepared (Sheet No.2):
artifacts visible on
the surface were plotted, numbered and collected; the bedrock
grinding stones were described and photographed; and descriptions
and sketches of the hearths were prepared.
Evaluation:
This site definitely qualifies for nomination
to the National Register of Historic Places.
The well preserved
midden is very regular in shape, which might indicate that the
location of the central pit has been stable over the course of
periodic recleanings; if so, it should facilitate investigation
of the structure and function of the pit. The apparently dif­
ferent areas of the site, mentioned above, suggest a kind of
functional partitioning of the site by its prehistoric occupants
for different kinds of daily activities--something that has not
yet been successfully demonstrated at any of the previously
excavated sotol pits in West Texas.
This site is expected to be totally destroyed by construction
of the dam.
Sit~

41 TE 50

Description:
This site is located on the alluvial valley
floor overlooking the arroyo to the northeast.
A fairly steep
bluff about 2 m. high and leading down to the present floodplain
borders the site on the northeast; to the north the site is
separated from 41 TE 56 by a major gully that does not appear
to be of recent origin.
The most obvious feature of the site is
a crescent-shaped midden of fire-cracked limestone detritus and
ashy soil; it is similar to, but smaller, than the one at 41 TE
48 and presumably represents fewer episodes of use or more
recycling of hearthstones.
It is about 4 x 9 m. high, and with
a small secondary pile of rock opposite the concave side (which
faces southeast, unlike the middens at 41 TE 48 and 56, which
face east).
A trench about 0.9 m. wide and 12 m. long, exca­
vated in 1973, bisects the midden from northwest to southeast,
providing a cross section of the midden and substrate (sheet No.
4).
A central pit is clearly visible (Fig. 6), although poorly
defined, and abundant wood charcoal from fuel used to fire the pit
is present in the fill.
In addition, two fragments of charred
plants, tentatively identified macroscopically as Agave
Zeahuguilla leaf sections, were recovered during excavation of
the trench in 1973.
There is good reason to expect that more
remains of these food and fuel plants can be recovered at all
three of the midden sites, and identified using newly developed
techniques.

7
The profile also reveals that the bottom of the rock layer
lies on a surface that is buried beneath about 25 cm. of (wind­
blown?) silt, although the surface itself is not visible in the
profile beyond the rock scatter.
If this upper unit is indeed
of eolian origin and is extensive over the terrace surface, it
may document continuing aridity or depressed vegetation cover
since abandonment of the sites--and it may also have blanketed
hearth areas farther back from the arroyo margin.
One of the
problems that became apparent during this phase of the work is
that we do not yet know whether the linear scatter of hearths
paralleling the southwest bank of the arroyo accurately repre­
sents prehistoric use of the space on the terrace surface here,
or alternatively, the emerging edge of a more extensive hearth
field with those features farther from the arroyo not yet ex­
posed by erosion.
The scatter of hearths mentioned above is actually part of
a continuous string of hearths exposed on the surface from an
unknown distance beyond the dam easement southeast of 41 TE 50
along the southwest side of the arroyo, to the north of 41 IE
56.
For convenience of designation all hearths southwest of
the gully separating 41 TE 50 and 56 have been assigned to 41
TE 50.
This scatter of 34 hearths, possible hearths. and assoc­
iated cultural debris extends northwest of the midden about 80 m.
or more and southeast about 125 m. covering a total area about
230 m. long and varying from about 16 m. to an estimated 40 m.
in width.
About half of this area lies on either side of the
dam centerline (although only one definite and one possible
hearth were noted north of grid line tA').
At least 18 of the
hearths have been badly eroded and/or deflated: perhaps 7 or so
are fairly intact.
Work done by the Survey: A measured diagram of the north­
east wall of the trench through the midden was drawn (sheet no.
4); a topographic contour map of the site was prepared; artifacts
visible on the surface were plotted, numbered, and collected;
descriptions and sketches of the hearths were recorded.
Two of
the eroded hearths ( #10 and 20) were sectioned to try to deter­
mine the information potential of these and other hearths that,
from surface inspection, appeared completely deflated.
These
sections indicated that surface inspection is a fairly reliable
guide and that none of the original matrix remained in the
deflated hearths.
Evaluation:
This site also qualifies for nomination to the
National Register.
The midden is expected to contain information
on its age, structure, and function; the terrace surface around
the midden, including the hearth area, may yield information on
the nature of the prehistoric social groups using the site.
Nearly all of this site will either be covered by the dam itself
or be removed as fill for the dam.

8

Site 41 TE 56
Description: This site is also on the terrace surface,
immediately overlooking the arroyo (the To is absent here),
separated from 41 TE 50 to the southwest by a major gully
(sheet no. 5).
A major feature of the site is a crescent­
shaped midden of fire-cracked limestone very much like those
already described at 41 TE 48 and 50, and located about 20 m.
(65 ft.) northwest of grid line 'A', and northeast of the ranch
road.
The terrain here slopes moderately eastward down into the
arroyo, and the concave side of the midden faces downslope. It
is about 4.5 x 10.0 m. across, and 0.4 m. high at most, with an
elongated smaller pile (2 x 7 m.) of rock to the east, poorly
defined on the upslope side where charcoal-stained silt has
filled the central pit.
This very dark, charcoal-stained ashy
silt not only covers the central pit, but also spreads across
a large area south and east of the midden, and the surface here
is also littered with fire-cracked rock.
No comparable feature
was observed at the other two middens.
The west edge of the
midden has been slightly disturbed by a recent borrow pit (see
sheet no. 5).
To the south and west of the midden is a large area with
cultural debris, but no hearths, covering the crest of the ridge.
There are also nine hearths scattered along the terrace edge to
the north and south of the midden (four of these have been
partially damaged by a ranch road or by survey transects cleared
by the SCS; the remaining hearths, at least two may be intact).
In addition, there is a large (7 m. diameter) pavement of fire­
cracked rock at the south end of the site, eroding into a gUlly.
The entire site is about 55 x 170 m. in size.
Work done by the Survey: A topographic contour map was
prepared, artifacts visible on the surface were plotted, numbered
and collected; and the hearths were described and sketched.
Evaluation:
This site also qualifies for nomination to
the National Register, on the same basis as 41 TE 48 and 50.
Site 41 TE 53
Description:
The southernmost of three small west-facing
rockshelters on the east bank of the arroyo, at the foot of the
talus slope, this one lies across the arroyo from 41 TE 56. It
is formed by a shallow overhang 10 m. long and 3.5 m. deep at
most (sheet no. 6).
This shelter is barely above the arroyo bed.
The other two shelters to the north are progressively higher
since the stratum of resistant limestone forming the overhang

9

apparently dips southward slightly faster than the stream bed;
and since the channel has cut closer to the base of the ridge
upstream, the talus slope in front of each shelter is steeper
going upstream.
At present, cultural deposits fill the shelter
to within 80 cm. or less of the ceiling (which slopes downward
toward the rear of the shelter): the surface of the deposits is
about 1.3 m. above the present arroyo bed.
However, the base
of the cultural deposits rests on alluvial gravels from the
arroyo about 0.4 m. above the present bed, giving about 1.7 m.
of headroom at the beginning of occupation.
Smoke stains or
lichen growth stain the ceiling.
Bedrock grinding facets are
reported present on top of the rock ledge forming the overhang
in the vicinity of 41 TE 53 and 54, but were not observed during
our fieldwork.
The extent and thickness of cultural deposits outside the
shelter is very difficult to assess because there are few sur­
face clues, but probably covers an area 5 x 10 m. or less. An
overflow channel of the arroyo (see sheet no. 6) cuts near the
shelter and may have removed some of the exterior cultural
deposits.
A 1 x 2 m. test pit was excavated (in 10 cm. levels) in
1973 just south of the center of the shelter.
It revealed about
85 cm. of homogeneous gray, ashy silt overlying sterile alluvial
gravels, which in turn overlies a sterile whfre chalklike deposit
(see 41 TE 54 text for description).
The field notes mention
recovery of a leaf (sotol?) section at 30 to 40 cm. below the
surface, but otherwise no perishable remains were found.
Work done by the Survey: A topographic map of the shelter
was prepared, two of the walls,ofthe test pit dug in 1973
were straightened up and cleaned off, and a diagram of the
deposits was recorded.
Evaluation:
This site qualifies for nomination to the
National Register.
While it is unlikely that construction of
the dam will directly affect the site, at least some additional
investigation of these small shelters is necessary to understand
their function in the complex of sites located near the east end
of the dam.
Our division of the archeological remains into
separate sites should not obscure the fact that part or all of
the shelters, middens, and hearth areas may have been contem­
poraneous parts of the same prehistoric 'community'.
Site 41 TE 54
Description: This is another small shelter located about
25 m. farther upstream from 41 TE 53, and directly across the

10
arroyo from 41 TE 56 (Fig. 7).
It has about the same floor
area as the previously described shelter and is about 11.5 m.
long, but at the north end has the greatest overhang of all
three shelters, about 4.5 m. deep.
The surface of the deposits
is about 1.4 m. above the present arroyo bed; the base, an
estimated 0.6 m. above it.
The overhang in this shelter is
composed of parts of two different limestone beds:
a lower
ceiling 85 cm. or less above the surface, and an upper, farther
projecting ledge about 1.2 m. above the lower ceiling.
The
ceilings are thoroughly blackened from smoke stains and/or lichen
growth.
The outer face of the lower ceiling bears very faint
traces of red (hematite?) stains, possibly the eroded remains of
prehistoric artwork, somewhat obscured at the base by blood­
stains from sheep rubbing against the overhang.
Rocky talus
piles fan into the shelter at both ends.
Outside the shelter
several large boulders buried in the cultural deposits are
visible, perhaps large collapsed roof sections.
A 1 x 2 m. test pit, beginning at the rear wall near the
center of the shelter and running nearly to the overhang, was
excavated in 10 cm. levels in 1973.
The test pit revealed
about 80 cm. of homogeneous, gray, ashy silt, essentially
identical to the fill in 41 TE 53, overlying a stratum of com­
pact, sterile olive drab colored clay (oxidizing to yellow
after exposure), vertically fissured with desiccation cracks
(Fig. 8).
The clay overlies a stratum of unidentified, friable,
white chalky material (marl or calcareous hardpan?) that looks
like kaolinite; a few lenses of this material occur in the clay.
This deposit is also the basal stratum exposed at 41 TE 53, where
it seems to lie slightly lower, the upper portion along with the
green clay perhaps having been cut away by arroyo floodwaters
(1).
Overlying the chalky stratum at the west end of the 41 TE
54 provile is a lens of sterile alluvial gravels.
The cultural debris recovered from this test pit was very
similar to that recovered from 41 TE 53.
According to the field
notes some fibrous material was recovered at 55 and 75 cm. below
the surface, but otherwise no perishable material was found.
Again, as at the other shelter the extent and thickness
of the cultural deposits outside the shelter are difficult to
estimate, but an area as large as 6 x 15 m. may be involved;
the deposits form a narrow but rather flat terrace adjacent to
the shelter, with moderate amounts of fire-cracked rock (most
of which probably did not come from the test pit) littering the
surface.
The steep talus slopes fronting many Trans-Pecos
shelters are considered to be refuse dump areas only, but the
topography and size of these small shelters suggests much of
the activity there may have occurred in front of them.

Work done by the Survey:
Evaluation:
Register.

Same as at 41 TE 53.

Qualifies for nomination to the National

Site 41 TE 55
Description: The northernmost rockshelter, this one is
located about 50 m. (165 ft.) upstream from 41 TE 54.
It con­
sists of two sections, an upper (north) and lower (south)
section, with a maximum overhang of little more than 2 m.
Total length of the shelter is about 11 m.
This is the smallest
and most cramped of the three shelters, with only 60 to 80 cm.
of headroom in the northern section.
Large collapsed roof
blocks form a natural retaining wall at the outer edge of the
shelter, limiting the habitable space to the shelter interior.
Outside the terrain drops rapidly to the arroyo below, and is
covered by a thicket of persimmon and manzanita. According to
the original survey records there is a series of grooves in
the bedrock, and traces of possible rock art (in yellow) at
the north end of the shelter, beyond the overhang.
The surface of the cultural deposits is about 2 m. above
the bed of the arroyo.
The deposits exposed in the test pit
in the north section consist of about 70 cm. of homogeneous
brown to gray silt with occasional limestone spalls and cultural
debris.
The fill here is less ashy, with more limestone dust
than in the other shelters, probably indicating fires were
seldom built in the restricted space available.
The cultural
deposits overlie limestone bedrock and a zone of roof fall. No
perishable materials aside from apparently modern leaves and
nutshells were recovered.
Work done by the Survey: A topographic map of the shelter
was prepared, and a I x 2 m. test pit was laid out running from
the back wall to the dripline 'in the north section, and exca­
vated in 10 cm. levels, with fill passed through a 1/4 inch
screen.
Stratigraphic diagrams of three of the test pit walls
were recorded.
This site qualifies for nomination to the
Evaluation:
National Register.
Floodwater Retarding Structure 11
The archeological sites within this project were visited
several times for the specific purpose of locating and marking
features 80 they could be avoided by the surveying, clearing,

12
and drilling crews to be operating there prior to further
archeological work.
Four sites, 41 TE 62, 41 TE 63, 41 TE 64,
and 41 TE 65 were known to exist near or within the confines
of the project.
Additional features were found to be associated
with 41 TE 62 and 41 TE 63, and a new site, 41 TE 106, was
found on the margins of the easement.
Time did not permit the thorough recording, mapping, and
other documentation which was accomplished at Structure 8 and
Structure 9.
However, it is felt that the observations· made
during the several visits to Structure 11 are sufficient to
allow reasonable statements as to their integrity and potential.
Site 41 TE 62
Description:
This site is bisected by a ranch road on
the west side of the alluvial valley floor.
It is approximately
200 m. upstream from the west end of the dam site and is within
the limits of the sediment pool.
The site consists of a small
crescent midden (which has been partially disrupted) and a
series of intact and partially intact stone fire hearths. Arti­
facts were observed near the features but none were collected.
At least three of the observed hearths are nearly covered by
alluvial or eolian fill, suggesting there may be buried components
at the site.
Evaluation:
The integrity of several of the hearths and
the apparent spatial patterning of hearth areas in relation to
the crescent midden suggests that this site may potentially
yield significant information similar to that indicated at
site 41 TE 50 (see Structure 9).
The site is considered to be
eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places.
Site 41 TE 63
Description:
This site lies in the alluvial valley floor
just south of 41 TE 62.
The downstream end of the site lies
on the centerline of the dam and the remainder is located within
the limits of the sediment pool.
41 TE 62 consists of a primary
cluster of stone fire hearths (these were originally reported
to be a disrupted crescent midden in 1971) with individual
hearths located on the alluvial flats to the south.
There are
three features at this site which are of particular interest; a
few meters south of the primary cluster of hearths is a large
basin-shaped hearth which has been slightly disturbed along one
edge.
Adjacent to the basin-shaped hearth is a possible circu­
lar arrangement of stones which bears striking similarities to

13
historic and proto-historic tipi rings.
Adjacent to the
suggestive circular arrangement of stones is a low oval stone
cairn; the stones in the cairn do not appear to be burned and
the entire feature is dissimilar to the observed fire hearths.
The probabilities are high that this cairn marks a grave; ex­
cavations are necessary to confirm or reject this probability.
Evaluation:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Not
only is there potential for further documenting the temporal,
spatial, and structural characteristics of the stone hearths,
but the site potentially contains information about dwellings
and burial practices.
Site 41 TE 64
Because of previous recommendations and the disturbed
condition of this site, it is not considered worthy of further
description or evaluation.
Site 41 TE 65
This site was found to be marginal to but outside of the
detention pool limits.
It is thus outside of the easement and
was not considered for evaluation.
Site 41 TE 106
Description:
This small mound of burned rock and dark
gray ashy fill was discovered during the current season of
work.
It lies just downstream from the west end of the dam
axis and adjacent to, but apparently just outside of, the
easement line.
Situated in the edge of the creek bed at the
point where a lateral tributary enters Threemile Draw from
the west, the site is apparently intact. It is different from
all other sites which have been noted in the region and its
presence is problematical.
Evaluation:
Since this site was found to be immediately
adjacent to, but outside of, the easement, it was not con­
sidered during the present evaluation.
However, if access
routes or other consturction activities are found to endanger
this site, measures should be taken to evaluate it prior to
any modifications in the area.

A PROGRAM RECOMMENDED TO MITIGATE LOSS
OF ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES TO BE AFFECTED
BY FLOODWATER RETARDING STRUCTURES
The archeological remains in the project area contain three
principal kinds of useful data:
(1)

a potential record documenting changes in the natural
environment over the past 2000 years, and perhaps
even earlier;

(2)

a record of prehistoric human adaptation to the
environment that at times may have specialized
heavily in extracting wild plant foods;

(3)

potential data on the spatial organization and,
possibly even some clues on the size and composition
of the prehistoric social groups using the plant
processing sites.

The following discussion will elaborate on these areas of
interest and is organized in terms of interrelated research
problems.
Later an item-by-item research program, organized
according 'to the individual sites involved, will be presented.
Investigation of the plant Processing Sites
Crescent-shaped middens such as 41 TE 48, 50, and 56 are
generally conceded to be the remains of earth ovens used for
cooking agave, soto1, or yucca (Greer 1965, 1968, 1975) based
on the location of these sites adjacent to natural stands of
these plants, and on several rather detailed ethnographic
account from the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico (for
example, Dennis and Dennis 1925; Curtis, 1907; Spier 1928, and
others). While this interpretation of their function seems
fairly secure, it has not yet been demonstrated by recovering
specimens of the food plants from the middens.
In the early
1930's A.T. Jackson noted "countless fragments of sotol leaves"
scattered around the seven "sotol" pits in the interior of Fate
Bell Rockshe1ter, a large dry shelter in Val Verde County
(Pearce and Jackson, 1933:16), but identification of the plant
remains was ad hoa rather than being done by a botanist.
In almost every case where ring or crescent middens have
been excavated in the past, the technique used has been to
excavate a narrow profile trench bisecting the midden.
No

'.

15
serious attempts to recover charred botanical remains from the
central pit seem to have been made, nor has substantial exca­
vation of the area around the midden itself been attempted,
except at Midden 1 of the Perro Salvaje Site in Sutton County
(Jarvis and Crawford, 1974) which may not actually be a ring
midden.
Our knowledge of these sites includes the following gaps:
(1)

What species were processed?

(2)

How many episodes of use are represented?

(3)

Can anything be learned about the size and com­
position of groups engaged in plant processing by
excavating around the middens?

The possible lechuguilla leaf sections excavated at 41 TE
50 suggest recovery of charred plant remains from careful
excavation in the middens is feasible, and if fragments retain­
ing the epidermis can be recovered. it is now possible to
identify the species represented by using newly developed
techniques that involve taking a miscroscopic section for com­
parison with epidermal cells from modern plant reference
specimens (Dering and Shafer 1976). Additional evidence might
also be forthcoming if any economic pollen can be found pre­
served in these open sites.
Pollen of Agave species has
frequently been found in coprolites excavated from dry shelters
(Bryant 1969, 1974, 1975).
Determining how many episodes of use are represented is
likely to be more difficult.
In most cases repeated use seems
to be indicated, with re-excavation of the central pit perhaps
shifting its location, and recycling of rocks and earth fill
further obscuring the depositional history, so that strati­
graphic profiles often do not reveal how many episodes are
involved.
Perhaps a better way to approach the problem is to
look at prehistoric use of the terrace surface around the
middens, to determine whether spatial units of occupation can
be recognized.
Another important problem is to determine whether
there are tool types present that are specifically related to
the harvesting and processing of wild plant foods (e.g.,
sequent flake knives, manos, metates, hammerstones) or plant
fibers (notched flakes, "planes fl ) .
Plant fibers are critical
to an economy dependent on maintaining nets used to harvest
small game
Animal Bones
According to the field notes from the 1973 excavations at
41 TE 53 and 54, moderate amounts of animal bone (probably mostly

16
deer and rabbit, suggesting use of both stalking and netting
strategies) were recovered from the fill in these shelters
(only a couple of bone scraps were found in our test pit at
41 TE 55).
No animal bone or shell was recovered from the
trench at 41 TE 50, nor was any noted on the surface around
these sites.
If bone is in fact absent from the open sites,
does it simply indicate poor bone preservation, or no proces­
sing of game kills at these particular sites (mussel shells
and animal bones have been found at other ring middens, but
usually in small quantities).
Comparison of soil samples from
the open and sheltered sites should serve to test these com­
peting explanations.
Adaptation to the Natural Environment
The archeological remains in the project area are not
randomly distributed over the landscape.
The 47 possible
hearths recorded in our fieldworK at Damsite 9 are strung out
along the edge of the floodplain at the break in slope with the
present floodplain (where it is present), roughly 40 m. or less
from the present channel.
At Damsite 8 the spatial pattern is
similar, although the shallow arroyo there has not cut a well
defined terrace system into the alluvial flats, and erosion is
consequently somewhat less severe.
Even though the present
channel is dry (presumably due to increasing aridity during the
prehistoric period, accelerated by aquifer depletion in historic
times), it seems likely that:
(1)

hearth distribution maps onto location of available
water during the prehistoric period; or alternatively,

(2)

hearth distribution maps onto location of some other
critical resource in the arroyo margin habitat, such
as firewood; or

(3)

hearth distribution is a function of recent erosion
a~ the edge of the terrace (this hypothesis was dis­
cussed above in the section describing 41 TE 50).

Although it seems unlikely we can discriminate between hypotheses
1 and 2, we can certainly test hypothesis 3 by placing test
excavations where buried hearths might be expected.
At Damsite 9, crescent middens and rockshelters are tightly
clustered in or adjacent to the arroyo margin habitat precisely
at the point where the arroyo cuts against the base of the ridge
(the location of the shelters is, of course, invariable; what is
of interest here is the fact that they were occupied).
In fact,

------~--

......

17
most of the archeological remains in the lower reaches of the
valley form a sort ~f site complex here.
The only site located
in the juniper/talus fan habitat is 41 TE 57, and it appears to
be significantly different from all the other sites.
At Damsite
11, the sites again show definite clustering, with one midden
on the terrace surface near a dry wash, and hearths strung out
on either side of the wash, and essentially no archeological
remains as yet discovered along Threemile Draw.
This clustering of sites within selected parts of the project
area is probably an indicator of the location of natural resources
that were critical to the prehistoric populations.
Water has
already been mentioned; the location of plant communities surely
was also critical, especially if sites such as 41 TE 48, 50, 56,
and 62 were indeed plant processing localities.
The talus
slopes and ridge crests flanking the valleys (Ector-Rock outcrop
complex and Sanderson-Upton association; Soil Survey of Terrell
County, Texas, 1974) were probably prime habitats for agave and
sotol in the past as today.
As a baseline for understanding pre­
historic land use practices, a botanical survey of the modern
vegetation is essential.
Fortunately, a grid of transects
cleared by the Soil Conservation Service for detailed topographic
surveys (Fig. 1) already exists at each of the project areas,
with control stakes at key grid points.
The most expensive
and time-consuming phase of the work has already been done, and
using the existing transects it should be possible to record
vegetation inventories that do not simply list the plants
present, but actually map the plant communities present.
It is
important to extend the botanical transects up the talus slope
and onto the ridge crest on both sides of the valleys. if per­
mission to enter can be obtained.
This would simply involve
recording the vegetation at points mapped in with an engineer's
transit set up at the base of the slope.
Our hypothesis is that
the talus slope and ridge crest zones may have been harvest
areas for agave, sotol, or other plants. Archeological evidence
of harvesting (such as discarded hammerstones or rejuvenation
flakes displaying silica gloss) is not expected to be conspicuous.
and it may not even be present, but should nevertheless be
searched for while the botanical surveys are being carried out.
Environmental Change
Fossil pollen records in southwest and west Texas are avail­
able from the Amistad region (Bryant 1969) the Guadalupe Mountains
(ibid.), and the southern Llano Estacada (ibid.; Wendorf and
Hester 1975). Very little archeological work has been done in
the vast region in between, and there are no paleoenvironmental
data from the Sanderson area.
Bryant's research in the Amistad

18
region indicates a mesic climatic period at about 2500 years
ago, followed by a gradual trend towards increasing aridity
to present times (Bryant 1969: 122 ff).
We do not know how
applicable the Amistad pollen sequence is to the Sanderson
area, 500 m. (1600 ft.) higher in elevation and with 4 to 5
inches less rainfall per year at present.
Although pollen generally does not preserve well in open
sites, samples from the midden and hearth areas should be col­
lected and checked for minimum-grain counts.
Better chances
for preservation probably exist in the rockshelters at Damsite
9, where an ideal data set would consist of stratigraphic samples
of pollen and small fauna with associated 14C. samples.
In addition to the potential clues provided by studies of
fossil pollen and the bones of small animals (which are usually
good indicators of climatic conditions), there are some
interesting geomorphologic features in the project area which
seem consistent with the record of increasing aridity in the
Amistad region.
We have already mentioned the possible mantle of
windblown silt that appears to cover the foot of the midden at
41 TE 50.
An important problem is to find how extensive this
possible silt blanket is, because (1) it may document depressed
vegetation cover in the alluvial flats following the period when
the site was used; (2) it may conceal additional hearths and
debris scatters.
Another possible bit of evidence was found at the rock­
shelters 41 TE 53 and 54, where alluvial gravels were observed
in the profiles at about 40 and 60 cm. respectively, above the
present arroyo bed.
This might simply indicate normal undu­
lations in the arroyo bed.
However, it could also indicate the
arroyo is presently cutting down through earlier bedload
deposits, a change in the erosional regime that would also be
consistent with a hypothesis of increased aridity and depressed
vegetation cover.
Extending the existing profiles toward the
arroyo and collecting gravel samples for grain size analysis
should help determine if there have been changes in the stream
gradient or bedload capacity of the arroyo since occupation of
the shelters began.
One other feature that needs to be briefly investigated is
a dark stratum observed an estimated 70 cm. below the surface
of the present floodplain, in the west cutbank of the arroyo
downstream from the dam centerline at Damsite- 9.
This zone may
simply be a buried paleosol, ,but it deserves further examination.

APPENDIX:
ADDITIONAL EVALUATION OF DAMSITE 8
Additional archeological investigation of Area B at 41 TE 61
was carried out during parts of July and August, 1976, in order
to examine the enlarged easement acquired by the SCS as a fill
preparation site.
This area, which extends eastward to 260-400
feet from the dam centerline, was checked for archeological re­
mains.
Description:
Two hearths were found just within the new
easement on the north side of the arroyo, both situated near the
edge of the low, boulder-strewn escarpment separating the present
floodplain from the first terrace.
One hearth was found eroding
into a small gully; it was obviously not intact and was not in­
vestigated further.
On the south side of the arroyo, no hearths were found with­
in the easement~ but chipping debris from an extensive quarry was
located on the bench overlooking. the arroyo (and extending about
three-fourths of the way up the talus slope on the south side of
the aanyon) is present.
This quarry area (informally designated
as 'Area E') has not been previously discussed; it is considerably
larger and contains more debris thann Area A.
Work ddne by the Survey:
One of the hearths in the new
easement appeared to be undisturbed.
A 10-meter square grid was
laid out enclosing it, and a controlled surface collection in
2-meter squares was made.
A measured plan of the hearth waS pre~
pared, and it was cross-sectioned with a shallow trench.
Sect(bn­
ing revealed closely packed buried hearthstones, but no intact
fill, suggesting the hearth may have been deflated and then
reburied.
A sample of fill for fine screening was collected, and
the cross section drawn and photographed.
A topographic contour
map of the terrain around the hearths was also prepared.
Evaluation:
The investigation of this part of the site
carried out in May and July/August has adequately sampled the
available archeological data.
No further investigation of this
area is recommended.

APPENDIX

FURTHER ARCHEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS AT FLOODWATER RETARDING
STRUCTURE 8, SANDERSON CANYON WATERSHED PROJECT, TERRELL
COUNTY, TEXAS

by

Kenneth M. Brown

and
Elton R. Prewitt

INTRODUCTION
During the summer of 1976 the Texas Archeological Survey con­
ducted further brief assessments of the archeological resources
t~be directly affected by the construction of Floodwater Retarding
Struc.ture 8 in the Sanderson Canyon Watershed.
Structure 8 is
located about 8.5 kilometers north-northwest of the town of
Sanderson and spans a nameless dry wash that enters Threemile Draw
from the west (Fig. A-I).
The objective of the additional assess­
unts was to provide a conclusive demonstration of the eligibility
of site 41 TE 61 for nomination to the National Register of
Historic P lac es •
The fieldwork lasted for 15 working days with a crew of three
people and was intended to document the precise location of two
ujor cluasters of prehistoric hearths on the canyon floor along
~e north side of the tributary arroyo.
These two areas (labelled
B and C) and three others have been designated (chiefly for conven­
hnce in recording) as parts of a single site, 41 TE 61:
Area A - Quarry on ridge, spillway area; investigated
by TAS in May 1976
Area B - Hearth cluster bisected by dam centerline;
partially investigated in M~y, add~tional
investigations reported herein
Area C - Hearth cluster, north side of arroyo at road
crossing; investigation same as Area B
Area D - Two hearth clusters, south side of arroyo;
no formal investigation
Area E - Extensive quarry on bench and lower talus
slope at south end of dam; no investigation
The fieldwork extended from July 21 to August 7, 1976, and
was concentrated at Area B since it was anticipated that this area
would be totally destroyed during the early stages of dam construc­
tion; also Area B was expected to yield more significant data than
Area C. The purpose of this addendum is to summarize the work
~complished and to provide the required assessment of the National
Register of Historic Places eligibility of site 41 TE 61.
As in the earlier work at Sanderson Canyon in 1976, the in­
"stigations were done under the field direction of Kenneth M.
Brown with Elton R. Prewitt serving as the supervising archeologist.
David S. Dibble, Director of the Texas Archeological Survey, was

principal investigator.
The crew members~ Jane Laurens~ Steve
M. Kotter, and
Robert L. Stiba, are thanked for their profes­
sional conduct during the investigations. Larry Seymore, District
Conservationist of the Soil Conservation Service in Sanderson,
provided invaluable assistance to the crew. The landowners, the
late Charles R. Downie and Leslie O. Downie, graciously permitted
access to their porperty.

WORK ACCOMPLISHED
Seven principal kinds of work were carried out at 41 TE 61
during this assessment; these are individually detailed below.
Refined mapping. Although a preliminary map of the hearths
had already been prepared (map sheet 1) a somewhat more precise
mapping was desirable in order to study hearth clustering and to
measure nearest-neighbor distances between hearths.
This was done
by keying measured plans of the hearths to the grid lines estab­
lished for the controlled surface collection. Measured plans were
drawn of all hearths covered by surface collection grids (excluded
were one badly disturbed hearth at Area B and four at Area C).
Figure A-2 is a plan of one of the best preserved hearths at Area

B.
A topographic plane table map of Area B was prepared (field
time was insufficient for topographic mapping of Area C). A
Brunton compass traverse on the south side of the arroyo at Area
D was made to map approximate locations of hearths there; a total
of 15 were located.
Controlled surface collection.
This was the most extensive
and time-consuming part of the fieldwork. A transit and steel
tapes were used to impose square grids ten meters on a side over
hearths and/or hearth clusters; each grid was subdivided into
25 2x2m quadrats using intersecting string lines. All cultural
debris exposed on the surface was then collected by quadrat.
Figure 4 shows an area covered by-several of these grids (each
small square is 2 meters across; hatchured areas are hearths).
Contour lines indicate the raw frequencies for chipping debris and
tools recovered from the surface (unequal-size intervals are indi­
cated at the bottom of the map; areas with more than 12 ~tems per
2x2m quadrat are shaded; the mean for this area is 8.3 items).
Four hundred and sixty-three quadrats were collected in this
manner and covered 1~852 square meters of terrain in Area B. One
hundred and forty-five quadrats covering 580 square meters were
collected at Area -C--a total of 2,432 square meters.

Hearth sectioning.
Thirteen hearths at Area B were cross­
sectioned both to obtain charcoal samples for radiocarbon dating
and to investigate their construction and use.
Eight of these con­
tained intact hearth fill with enough charcoal for radiocarbon
assay.
Two hearths at Area C were sectioned, one of which yielded
a charcoal sample. Documentation included photographs and mea­
sured plans of surface and subsurface hearth stones, and a cross
section profile through each hearth. Matrix samples were collected
for fine screening and in some cases samples intended for pollen
analysis were collected.
Limited excavation. An area 6xlO meters in size surrounding
Hearth 4 on all sides was excavated to 10 em. below ground surface
to learn whether the information gained from excavation would sub­
stantially modify that already obtained from the controlled col­
lections.
Very little material (but more than was found on the
surface) was recovered in the excavation of the 56 lxl meter units,
and the information should be useful for testing the quantitative
model of differential sheet erosion. An additional 2x2 meter
square was excavated to the north of Hearth 4.
Hearth photography.
It was discovered that the photos taken
from ground level in the earlier phases of investigation at
41 TE 61 did not provide adequate documentation of hearth plans.
Consequently, all of the hearths at Area B and some of those at
Area C were rephotographed from an 8-foot stepladder.
Vegetation transect. Larry Seymore, District Conservationist
for the Soil Conservation Service, made an informal inventory of
the current vegetation along a transect which corresponds to the
SCS grid 'A'. The inventory extends onto the canyon rim on each
side of the arroyo (and the site). The inventory lists 55 dif­
ferent kinds of plants growing at Structure 8 and provides an
approximate idea of the modern vegetation in the apparent resource
area probably used by the prehistoric occupants of the site.
Additional reconnaissance.
Reconnaissance of an area desig­
nated as a 'fill preparation site' east of the dam centerline at
Area B was accomplished. Further reconnaissance around and be­
tween areas Band C was also done.
Two hearths were recorded in
the area enclosed by the extended easement boundary, and another
hearth near the center of Area B (not discovered during the previ­
ous work in May) was recorded.

LABORATORY PROCESSING OF THE DATA
~he first phase of laboratory work has been directed toward
producing accurate maps of cultural debris concentrations en­
countered in the surface collection grids, but this alone is a

complex task because so much of the variability in surface debris
frequencies now appears to be due to differential erosion and
other factors rather than to the debris-discarding behavior of
the aboriginal occupants.
The surface collection from each 2x2
meter quadrat has been washed and sorted into four categories:
(1) naturally fractured chert, (2) heat-fractured chert. (3) fire­
cracked limestone, and (4) chipping dehris or tools.
Counts of
these items a~ tallied on a sheet which includes a code number,
location, and percentage estimate of vegetation cover for each
quadrat.
Figure A-3 is a sample data sheet for part of the area
shown in Figure A-4.
A second phase of data manipulation which may provide further
insights is contemplated; this phase includes extended computerized
analysis beyond that normally accomplished for this type of investi­
gation. A description of the intended analysis is discussed below.
Once all the data on the tally sheets have been keypunched for
computer processing it will be possible to produce scatterplots
and measures of co-variation between variables in the data set.
Figure A-5 for example (plotted by hand for that portion of Area
B west of the dam centerline), shows one of the relationships which
might be expected. Each dot on this scatterplot represents a
single 2x2 meter quadrat. Figure 5 clearly shows that there is a
predictable non-linear relationship between the amount of cultural
debris and naturally fractured chert (which occurs everywhere
throughout the alluvial valley fill) exposed on the surface.
Since there is no reason to expect a causal relationship be­
tween these two variables, it must be true that another (exo­
genous) variable is causing the co-variation.
This is most likely
sheet erosion; in heavily washed portions of the site, everything
originally contained in the upper few centimeters of sediment now
lies exposed on a crusted surface, but areas with moderate grass
cover have actually stablized this mantle of silt which covers
most of the debris (this is especially true of the area around
Hearth 4).
The result is that differential erosion from quadrat
to quadrat has created fluctuations in the debris counts which
mask the true spatial pattern of the presumably contemporaneous
debris disposal.
However, the frequency counts of naturally fractured chert
provide an index of the amount of erosion, and the vegetation
estimates are an independent check on the relationship.
It
should thus be possible to produce corrected debris maps that
eliminate the effects of differential sheet erosion.
This can
be a.ccomplished by uSing trend surface residual mapping or some
other appropriate technique of computer analysis.

Research Problems
Collection of data in the field was based on the assumption
that only one component (chiefly middle Archaic, and representing
several possible short-term occupations) was present
at the site.
Surface collection units were centered on the hearths for this
reason.
The assumption remained plausible throughout this phase
of investigation for the simple reason that with one exception (a
single late Archaic Ensor projectile point) all of the time-diag­
nostic artifacts noted form a small but consistently middle Archaic
(ca. 4000 B.P.) sample.

Five of the samples from Area B clu.ster in a maximum I-sigma
deviation range of 240 to 550 B.P. The other sample from Area B
and the single sample from Area C overlap with a maximum I-sigma
deviation range of 550 to 830 B.P. All of these dates are much
later than was expected on a purely typological basis. This
introduces the likelihood that much of the debris at the site
may be unrelated to the occupation responsible for the hearths.
In other words, the artifacts apparently predate the hearths by
some 3,000 years or perhaps more. With two exceptions - an end
scraper and a possible medial arrow point fragment - no chrono­
logically distinctive ~rtifacts suggesting the 240-830 B.P. time
range were found at the site.

*8. Valastro, Jr., personal communication, January 1977. I-sigma
deviation indicated. Radiocarbon years are expressed as before
present (B.P.) adjusted to be calculated fr~m A.D. 1950.
Dendrochronological corrections are not calculated.

40
Discriminating between these two probable comp9nents has
become a central problem of analysis which may be approached by
partitioning the surface debris into various categories and
checking for patterned spatial relationships between hearths and
particular debris or tool categories.
Another important source of data on the site is the series
of hearth maps.
There is a tendency, most evident within Area
B, toward pairing of hearths. Pairing is somewhat less evident
at Area C and D where occupation appears less intense, but is
suggested again at nearby Structure 9. The significance of
interhearth spacing is not yet well understood.
Clustering might
suggest that different hearths can be related to a Single occu­
pational episode.
Certainly it seems that if (1) each hearth
construction were an independent episode and (2) location were
not substantially influenced by persistent features of the camp­
site environment such as topography or vegetation patterns, then
hearth clustering would not be expected.
This hypothesis does not
bear up well in the case of hearths 6, 7, 8 and 9 which form a
closely spaced nort~outh alignment with each about 3 meters from
its neighbor.
The four radiocarbon dates form thr.e continuous
but non-overlapping (at I-sigma) units with Hearth 9 the earliest
and Hearth 6 the latest.
An alternate hypothesis would provide that the most recent
member of a pair was located to permit scavenging of hearthstones
from its predecessor. However, sectioning of the hearths revealed
no conclusive evidence of scavenging. Hearth 9, the oldest dated
at Area B, is one of the two best preserved hearths in the cluster
mentioned above (and at the site as a whole).
Three kinds of spacing, then, are potentially significant:
(1)
(2)
(3)

between members of a pair,
between members of adjacent pairs,
between more widely separated hearths

The first (and perhaps the second) can be demonstrated with
nearest-neighbor analysis if some kind of operational boundary
can be established for each macrocluster. Modalities in the
third kind of spacing, if they exist, are not conspicuous. The
distance between every possible pair of hearths on the map of
Area B has been scaled in order to compile a 16xl6 cell data
matrix withl36 separate entries (the 20 hearths recognized in
the field have, for various reason~, been reduced to 16). This
matrix is now ready to be keypunched and decomposed~ by an
appropriate data reduction program (possibly cluster analysis)
which will look for modalities in hearth spacing.

Provisional Generalizations about 41 TE 61
At this stage in the processing of the data, generalizations
about the site should be regarded as tentative and subject to re­
vision; all figures quoted are based on preliminary inventories
and are subject to change.
The following points seem most salient:
(1)
Two components appear to be present. A small sample
of middle Archaic projectile points provides evidence for the
earlier component, and radiocarbon-dated hearths ranging from
about 240 B.P. to 830 B.P. indicate the later component. Thus
far, very little debris can be recognized as belonging to the
later prehistoric component. Perhaps only quarrying and manufac­
'turing debris which is indistinguishable from the middle Archaic
scatter waS left at the site by these later peoples, or perhaps a
more detailed partitioning of tool categories than has been
attempted thus far is needed to isolate the components.
It has
become a major problem to determine whether any class or classes
of debris or tools show patterned spatial relationships to the
hearths.
(2)
The available evidence points to short-term occupation(s)
of the site.
Three observations are relevant:
a.Debris density is very low, ranging from 0.43
items/m 2 on the surface around Hearth 2 to a maximum
of 2.35 items 2 at the west end of Area B (nonsterile
quadrats only). Densities at Area C (partial sample
only) are about 0.50 items/m 2 . Such excavation as was
done suggests very little additional debris lies buried
under the surface.

'm

b.
The range of tool types is very restricted. A
preliminary inventory of items from the controlled
surface collections includes the following tools:
dart point basal fragments (a few with impact factures,
most with evidence of attempted reshapening); distal or
medial fragments, presumably from dart points (some
were ~pparentlY broken .during thinning); several bifaces
discarded in various stages of reduction; one possible
arrow point medial fragment; sequent flakes, some of
which are unifacially retouched or broken during re­
touching; one small metate fragment; one heavy chopping
tool (?);one side/end scraper and one fragment of a
unifacially retouched flake with heavy edge rounding
and polish; a few possible burins or burin spalls (it
is probable that none of these are actually burins or
burin spalls); and a large number of cores and core
remnants.
The dart point category includes three tri­
angular bifaces (Tortugas points) which could easily
be hafted cutting tools.
Scraping and grinding tools
seem to be rather infrequent in this assemblage.

c.
The impression is that there was little or no reuse
of hearths; however, relevant features to indicate'this
may have been too ephemeral to detect in the field. The
two best preserved hearths (6 and 9) at Area B certainly
did not appear to have been significantly (if at all)
disturbed after the rock layer was placed over the ex­
tinguished fire.
The intervening hearths (7 and 8) may
have been scavenged for rock, but much of the rock in
hearths 6 and 9 was clearly fractured in place.
The
hearth stones in Hearth 4 showed discolored areas in a
variety of orientations which might indicate reuse,
scavenging, or most likely, post-abandonment disturbance.
Most of the other hearths have been deflated
scattered,
or otherwise disturbed.
These observations suggest that
occupation(s) of the site were transitory.
(3)
Although no studies of manufacturing debris have been
attempted yet, it is already evident that an important acitivity
associated with Area B was chert quarrying--or more properly,
partial reduction of nodular and tabular chert collected on the
talus slopes both to the north and the south. Good quality chert
can be found weathering out of the limestone continuously for
about three quarters of the way up the talus slope on the south
canyon wall where there is an extensive outcrop. Literally tons
of chert, including cores, split and quartered nodules, rough
discarded bifaces and sequent flakes, lie exposed on the surface
of the steep talus slopes and juniper-covered bench at Area E.
In May of 1976 the survey party found discarded parent cores at
Area E which were surrounded by scatters of flakes; some of the
flakes could be matched to various cores.
That portion of Area B lying directly across the arroyo
from this quarry has debris densities that are as much as five
times as great as those of areas that are not adjacent to a quarry
area (such as the hearth 16, 3 and 2 localities of Area B, and
all of Area C), as the following table indicates for Area B:

Areas Band C are only two examples of a series of
hearth macroclusters that line the arroyo on both sides for an
unknown distance up and- down the canyon.
Other macroclusters
lie in a similar geomorphic position at Structure 9.
Examination
of aerial photographs seems to suggest that hearth clusters tend
to occur on patches of first terrace (Reagan silty clay loam) soils
not covered by talus fan colluvium.

CONCLUSIONS AND ASSESSMENT
The most obvious conclusion which can be drawn from the
preliminary analysis of the data recovered from Site 41 TE 61
is that surficially exposed debris scatters and hearth fields
are poorly understood at the present time.
Clearly there is a
serious discrepancy in the apparent association of artifacts
which are stylistically 3,000 years or so older than adjacent
rad~ocarbon-dated stone fire hearths.
This problem raises basic
questions regarding surficially associated features and artifacts
at other localities in Sanderson Canyon (and indeed the entire
Stockton Plateau) as well as questions regarding geomorphology,
climatic episodes, and site functions.
It is hoped that con­
tinued analysis of the data obtained from 41 TE 61 will provide
avenues of research which may be pursued during future archeo­
logical investigations in the region.
The purpose of the present investigations was to assess the
eligibility of this site for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places.
It is felt that the information contained
within the site is indeed of local significance in the inter­
pretations of the prehistoric usage of the Sanderson Canyon water­
shed. However, the mechanics of the data recovery operations
necessary to arrive at this assessment (mapping, collecting, and
excavating) have been such that a considerable portion of the
significant data have been removed from areas A, B, and C and
thus no longer exist at the site.
Therefore, it is strongly sug­
gested that the assessment has effectively mitigated the potential
loss of significant data at areas A, B, and C of 41 TE 61. No
further work is recommended for these three areas since it is
considered to be more advisable to direct investigative efforts
toward other s~milar sites which may yield corioborative or
contradictive information.
In sum, much of the significant data
have been removed from areas At B, and C of 41 TE 61 and these
~portions of the site are no longer of sufficient integrity to
warrant nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Conversely, areas D and E oj 41 TE 61 were no more than
surficially investigated. These two areas of the site are
marginal to Structure 8 and may not suffer significant damage.
Since it is felt that they do contain substantial information,

~

it is suggested that these areas be avoided during any construction
or clearing operations at Structure 8.
A small portion of Area E
will be destroyed by construction; however, the damage will be
slight if reasonable care is taken during construction.
If for
any reason the easement is extended or these areas cannot be
protected, then mitigation measures are felt to bein order for
those two areas of 41 TE 61.
