ABSTRACT
Project Title. Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of a 5.46-Mile Segment of the Proposed Orla Residue
Gas Pipeline on Texas Public Lands in Reeves County, Texas.
SWCA Project Number. 40216
Project Description. SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of portions of the proposed Orla Residue Gas Pipeline. The pipeline extends from the
Cryo Plant near Orla in Reeves County, through Ward County, to a location approximately 111 km (69
miles) to the south near Coyanosa in Pecos County, Texas. In Reeves County, the proposed pipeline would
span approximately 8.79 km (5.46 miles) of lands managed by the Texas General Land Office (referred to
as GLO Lands).
Location. GLO Lands in Reeves County, Texas.
Number of Acres Surveyed. In total, 157.87 acres were surveyed for cultural resources within the state of
Texas on GLO Lands.
Principal Investigator. Cherie K. Walth
Dates of Work. February 16–18, February 21, February 28–March 2, and April 11, 2017.
Purpose of Work. Enterprise is proposing to construct a residue line from the Cryo Plant near Orla in
Reeves County to the Waha Hub in Pecos County.
Properties Identified. Four newly recorded sites and 26 isolated finds (IFs) were encountered during the
course of the survey.
Eligibility of Properties. SWCA identified four previously undocumented cultural resource sites
(41RV111–41RV114) during the course of the survey, all of which are aboriginal lithic scatters. Based on
a lack of cultural features and subsurface components, it is the opinion of SWCA that sites 41RV112,
41RV113, and 41RV114 are ineligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as they would not provide new or important
data concerning regional prehistory. As such, SWCA recommends no further work at these three sites.
Feature 1, located on Private lands within 41RV111, has intact dateable deposits; however the remaining
surveyed portion of the site is heavily disturbed and lacks subsurface deposits. While 41RV111 is
recommended eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D and the feature should be avoided, the remainder of
the site is considered non-contributing to eligibility.
Curation. No artifacts were collected; curation of associated documentation associated with the fieldwork
will be completed.
Comments. In accordance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA, SWCA has made a reasonable and
good faith effort to identify cultural resources within the investigated project area. Based on the survey
findings, the project will have no adverse effect on cultural resources that warrant SAL designation or are
listed on, or meet the criteria to be listed on, the NRHP provided that Feature 1 at 41RV111 is avoided. If
Feature 1 on 41RV111 is avoided, then SWCA recommends that no further archaeological investigations
within the project area are warranted and the project should be allowed to proceed as planned.

Texas Public Lands in Reeves County, Texas

1 INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Enterprise Texas Pipeline, LLC. (Enterprise), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of components of the proposed Orla
Residue Gas Pipeline in Pecos, Ward, and Reeves Counties, Texas, which includes approximately
111 km (69 miles) of pipeline and appurtenant facilities. In Reeves County, the proposed pipeline
would span approximately 8.79 km (5.46 miles) of lands managed by the Texas General Land
Office (referred to as GLO Lands) (Figure 1.1, see Appendix A). This report addresses the results
of investigations on GLO Lands only.
Cultural resources investigations were conducted on GLO Lands to comply with the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT), as the planned project would occur on lands managed by the Texas General
Land Office. As such, SWCA examined the entire 8.79 km (5.46 miles) of proposed pipeline
alignment located on those lands (survey area). The cultural resource survey was performed with
an old landownership layer based on the Texas GLO file. Land ownership details changed once
civil survey shot in the survey markers for the proposed project. Discrepancies in the land
ownership files resulted in SWCA inadvertently surveying small portions of private lands (Figure
1.2-Figure 1.7).
SWCA conducted a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey within area of potential effects (APE)
on GLO Lands of approximately 8.79 km (5.46 miles) of pipeline ROW. Impacts associated with
the construction of the pipeline will occur within a 30.5-m-wide (100-foot-wide) pipeline
construction corridor (66.18 acres), 9 m (30 feet) of which will be the permanent ROW and 21 m
(70 feet) of which will be temporary ROW. The 61-m-wide (200-foot-wide) corridor centered on
the approximately 8.79-km-long (5.46-mile-long) proposed pipeline centerline provided by
Enterprise; subsequent shifts in the proposed project alignment added additional survey space, for
a total survey area of 157.87 acres. Impacts associated with the construction of the pipeline would
affect 66.18 acres within the 30.5-m (100-foot) corridor.
Overall, the proposed project would impact approximately 132.36 acres on GLO lands. Subsurface
impacts are anticipated to extend approximately 1.2 m (4 feet) below the existing ground surface
for the pipeline; however, subsurface impacts are anticipated to reach greater depths (3.7 m [12
feet]) to accommodate subsurface bores in order to avoid impacts to areas with existing
infrastructure and drainages.
SWCA archaeologists Courtney Blair, Kevin Pintz, Thea Stehlik-Barry, and John Stuurmans
performed the field investigations for the current project on February 16–18, February 21,
February 28–March 2, and April 11, 2017. The purpose of the work was to locate and identify
cultural resources within the APE, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate
with regard to the project area, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any site recorded
within the property for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All investigations were conducted in accordance
with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) standards, with any exceptions thoroughly
documented.

2 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area within GLO Lands is in northeastern Reeves County just west of the Pecos River
(see Figure 1.1) and area occurs in the Chihuahuan Desert (24), within the Chihuahuan Deserts
and Playas ecoregion (24a) (Griffith et al. 2004). The physiography of the region is generally a
continuation of basin and range terrain. The mountain ranges include faulted limestone reefs,
volcanoes, and associated basalt, rhyolite, and tuff extrusive rocks. The landscape is largely
internally drained outside the Rio Grande and Pecos River drainages. Vegetative cover is semidesert grassland and arid shrubland, except for high elevation islands of oak, juniper, and pinyon
pine woodland. The extent of desert shrubland is increasing across lowlands and mountain foothills
due to gradual desertification caused in part by historical grazing pressure (Griffith et al. 2004).
The Chihuahuan Deserts and Playas ecoregion includes alluvial fans, internally drained basins,
and river valleys below 1,067 m (3,500 feet). The major Chihuahuan basins in Ecoregion 24a, such
as the Hueco, Salt, and Presidio Basins, formed during the Basin and Range tectonism when the
Earth’s crust stretched and fault collapse resulted in sediment-filled basins. These low elevation
areas represent the hottest and most arid habitats in Texas, with less than 30.5 cm (12 inches) of
precipitation per year. Precipitation amounts are highest in July, August, and September, and
winter precipitation is relatively sparse. The playas and basin floors have saline or alkaline soils
and areas of salt flats, dunes, and windblown sand. The typical desert shrubs and grasses growing
in these environments are creosote bush, tarbush, fourwing saltbush, blackbrush, gyp grama, and
alkali sacaton (Brown 1994; Griffith et al. 2004).

2.1 GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The survey area is in northeast Reeves County running generally parallel to U.S. Highway 285.
Geology in the area is Pleistocene and Holocene-age alluvium and Holocene age terrace deposits
(USGS 1997). Soils in the survey area are mostly expressed on the surface by sandy loams, silty
loams, dense gravels, and exposed gypsum bedrock in the form of undulating slopes to relatively
flat, grassy areas. High percentages of calcium carbonate nodules are common in areas containing
these soils. Soils are identified by three primary soil associations (Hoban-Reeves-Holloman
association, Reakor association, Delnorte-Chilicotal association) mapped within the GLO Lands
portion of the project area (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2017).
Approximately 1 percent of the survey area is on Hodgins soils, which are not described below.
Hoban-Reeves-Holloman association includes soils from the Hoban, Reeves, and Holloman series.
The soils in this association are deep, moderately deep, shallow, and very shallow, nearly level
soils on uplands. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Hoban soils make up 30 to 40 percent of each mapped
area, Reeves soils make up 20 to 30 percent, and Holloman soils make up 5 to 40 percent. Other
soils make up as much as 15 percent of each mapped area. Hoban, Reeves, and Holloman soils are
well drained. The hazard of water erosion is slight and the hazard of soil blowing is moderate.
Most of these soils are used as rangeland, but they are suited to irrigated cropland if irrigation
water of sufficient quantity and good quality is available. The potential for growing native range
plants is medium because of very low rainfall. Characteristic plants are blue grama, black grama,
and burrograss. The potential for wildlife habitat is low (NRCS 2017).

Texas Public Lands in Reeves County, Texas

The soils in the Reakor association are deep, nearly level soils on outwash plains. Slopes range
from 0.5 to about 3 percent. Reakor soils make up 70 to 80 percent of the map unit. Other soils
make up 20 to 30 percent. Reakor soils are well drained. The hazard of water erosion is slight and
the hazard of soil blowing is moderate. The soils of this association are used as rangeland. These
soils are suited to irrigated cropland where water of sufficient quantity and good quality is
available. They are not suited to nonirrigated farming because of very low rainfall. The potential
for growing native range plants is medium because of very low rainfall. Characteristic native
vegetation is blue grama, black grama, and burrograss. The potential for rangeland wildlife habitat
is low (NRCS 2017).
The Delnorte-Chilicotal association consists of well-drained soils typically found on alluvial fans
and fan piedmonts between 686 and 1,372 m (2,250–4,500 feet) above mean sea level (NRCS
2017). Delnorte soils generally make up 60 percent of the association, with Chilicotal soils
constituting 20 percent and other soils making up the remaining 20 percent. The Delnorte series
consists of very shallow and shallow, well-drained, very gravelly, loamy soils on uplands. The
Delnorte series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They
are well-drained soils that are moderately rapidly permeable above and below a very slowly
permeable petrocalcic horizon. They formed in calcareous loamy alluvium containing igneous
gravel. These soils are on nearly level hilly uplands, fan piedmonts, and fan remnants. Slope ranges
from 0 to 30 percent. The Chilicotal series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately
permeable soils that formed in loamy gravelly piedmont sediments from igneous mountains. These
soils are on gently undulating to strongly rolling fan remnants and alluvial fans. Slopes range from
1 to 50 percent. These soils are on piedmont slopes, fan remnants, and alluvial fans below igneous
hills and mountains. Slopes along ridges range from 1 to 10 percent, and on side slopes from 5 to
about 50 percent. The soils formed in loamy gravelly sediments from succeeding erosional
sediments that built up these piedmont slopes. Characteristic usage includes livestock grazing and
wildlife habitat. Grasses in most areas are mainly chino grama, slim tridens, black grama, and
threeawns with woody vegetation of lechuguilla, creosote bush, skeletonleaf goldeneye, catclaw,
sotol, yucca, and ceniza (NRCS 2017).

2.2 DISTURBANCES
The primary disturbances within the portion of the project area on GLO Lands include the previous
construction of existing oil and gas field infrastructure (e.g., well pads, access roads, and
pipelines). Other disturbances include previous grading and clearing, utilities (subsurface), and
wind erosion/scouring.

2.3 TOPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE
The Pecos River is 10.85 km (6.74 miles) northeast of the eastern extent of the project area. Rustler
Hills is 23.09 km (14.35 miles) to the southwest, and Owl Hills is approximately 26.89 km (16.71
miles) northwest of the survey corridor. Nearby drainages include Salt Creek, which is 1.27 km
(0.79 mile) west of the western extent of the project area and undulates in a north and south
direction. Screw Bean Draw is 3.36 km (2.09 miles) west of the project area. Numerous small
intermittent playas are 10.14 km (6.30 miles) to the east of the survey corridor.

Annual temperature extremes are (or can be) significant, with summer temperatures regularly
exceeding 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) and winter temperatures dropping well
below freezing. The majority of precipitation occurs during the summer months and is associated
with thunderstorms. Precipitation ranges from around 20.3 to 30.5 cm (8–12 inches) a year. The
combination of rainfall and temperature makes for marked seasonality and a long growing season
(Western Regional Climate Center 2017).

2.4 FLORA AND FAUNA
The survey area occurs in the Chihuahuan Desert (24), within the Chihuahuan Deserts and Playas
ecoregion (24a) (Griffith et al. 2004). These low elevation areas represent the hottest and most arid
habitats in Texas, with less than 12 inches of precipitation per year. Precipitation amounts are
highest in July, August, and September, and winter precipitation is relatively sparse. The playas
and basin floors have saline or alkaline soils and areas of salt flats, dunes, and windblown sand.
The typical desert shrubs and grasses growing in these environments, such as creosote bush,
tarbush, fourwing saltbush, blackbrush, gyp grama, and alkali sacaton, must withstand large
diurnal ranges in temperature, low available moisture, and an extremely high evapotranspiration
rate. The alien saltcedar and common reed have invaded riparian areas. Land use, particularly
grazing, is limited in desert areas due to sparse vegetation and lack of water (Griffith et al. 2004).
The project area on GLO Lands is primarily composed of mesquite, creosote bush, plains and
soaptree yucca, silver bluestem, blue and black grama, and shinnery oak.
Vegetation in the survey area is low to high in occurrence. Dominant species include mesquite
shrub, acacia, and creosote bush. It is generally thought that there has been little change in the
vegetation and climate of the area since middle Holocene times (8000 B.P.); thus, current
environmental conditions provide a context for interpreting the prehistoric occupation of the area.
Animals that would have been commonly found in the area prior to development of the oilfields
include jackrabbit and cottontail rabbit, deer, pronghorn, various rats and mice, coyote, snakes,
turtles, quail, and badger. Many of these species were also of economic importance to the
prehistoric peoples of the area.

3 CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND SETTING
3.1 PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGY
The survey area is located in Reeves County, Texas, extending approximately 21.23 km (13.19
miles) south of the Texas-New Mexico border. The following archaeological background
describes prehistoric lifeways in southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Humans have inhabited
southeast New Mexico and west Texas for at least the last 13,000 years. This occupation reflects
a sequence of cultural development stretching from hunting and gathering, through the
development of agriculture, to historic and modern life. The culture history of the region is
commonly divided into four broad periods—Paleoindian, Archaic, Formative, and historic—each
of which is typified by different cultural adaptations. As part of the effort to revise the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) Carlsbad Field Office (CFO) Resource Management Plan, Jim Railey
from SWCA authored a Class I analysis of all known archaeological resources in the CFO region
(Railey 2013) and west Texas. The following discussion is adapted from Railey (2013) based on
the proximity of the project area to southeast New Mexico and supported by the similarity of the
cultural resource findings.

3.1.1 PALEOINDIAN TRADITION (11,500–7000 B.C.)
The earliest, well-established presence of humans in the region dates from Paleoindian tradition
(ca. 11,500–7000 B.C.), which is customarily divided into three periods: Clovis (11,500–10,800
B.C.), Folsom (10,800–9800 B.C.), and Late Paleoindian, or Plano (9800–7000 B.C.). Paleoindian
sites and components in the Jornada Mogollon region are recognized almost exclusively by
diagnostic artifacts associated with each of these periods (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:213), and
chronometrically dated at camp or kill sites, including ones in eastern New Mexico and west Texas
(e.g., Haynes 1992; Holliday 1997; Johnson and Holliday 1981). There are few identified
Paleoindian components in the region, although their components suggest concentrations along
the Pecos River, the Mescalero Escarpment Base, and in far southeastern Lea County, New
Mexico, near what were probably pluvial lakes (Condon and Smith 2012).
The Paleoindian tradition is best known from assemblages of flaked stone artifacts, and the
emphasis on formal, retouched tools during this time reflects a reliable and maintainable tool kit
that kept highly mobile hunter-foragers prepared for a variety of circumstances and encounter
situations (Bleed 1986; Kelly and Todd 1988; Jennings et al. 2010). Ground stone tools were
rarely, if ever, used during Paleoindian times, and this (along with the absence of baking pits and
hot-rock cooking) reflects an emphasis on meat in the diet, and a lack of exploitation of seeds and
other low-ranking food resources that required extending processing prior to consumption (see
Bettinger 2001).
Three Paleoindian complexes have been identified in the region, based on morphologically distinct
projectile point styles. The Clovis period corresponds to the Younger Dryas, a climatic interval
toward the end of the Pleistocene that was cool and dry (Cordell 1997:89; Haynes 2008; Holliday
and Meltzer 2010; Polyak et al. 2004). Clovis people hunted mammoths and other Pleistocene
megafauna, along with smaller animals (Cannon and Meltzer 2008; Cordell and McBrinn
2012:110). Tool assemblages include not only the distinctive Clovis fluted point, but also large
flake blades, biface and blade cores, knives, scrapers, core choppers, and burins (see Collins 2007).

During the Folsom period (10,800–9800 B.C.), the climate in the eastern Southwest and Southern
Plains became both warmer and wetter (Cordell and McBrinn 2012:115; Polyak et al. 2004). The
mobile hunter-forager lifeway continued. Mammoths were extinct by this time, and the focus of
big-game hunting shifted to Bison antiquus, a larger ancestor of the present-day bison (MacDonald
1981; Meltzer 2009; Surovell 2009). Smaller animals were also hunted by Folsom and later
Paleoindian groups as well (Amick 1996; Bamforth 2002; Cannon and Meltzer 2004). Tool kits
were somewhat more diverse than those of the Clovis period and include the diagnostic Folsom
fluted points and their unfluted counterparts (called Midland points), along with knives, gravers,
spokeshaves, pointed scrapers, cores (bifacial, discoidal, and informal), drills, burins, choppers,
abrading stones, awls, and needles (Frison and Bradley 1980; Huckell and Judge 2006; Meltzer
2006).
The warming trend during Folsom times continued during the subsequent Late Paleoindian or
Plano period (9800–7000 B.C.), but precipitation trends reverse as drier conditions once again set
in (Mallouf 1981; Monger and Buck 1995; Van Devender 1990). The fluted points of the Clovis
and Folsom periods were replaced by various unfluted lanceolate styles, classified within various
complexes such as Plainview, Firstview, and Cody (Cordell and McBrinn 2012:106–107).
Otherwise, tool assemblages were, overall, similar to those of the previous periods. People
continued to rely on hunting and foraging for their subsistence (Cannon and Meltzer 2004). Bison
continued to be the main big-game prey, although Bison antiquus was extinct by this time, with
smaller bison similar to the present-day species having taken their place (MacDonald 1981).

3.1.2 ARCHAIC TRADITION (7000 B.C.–A.D. 500)
The Archaic tradition covers a vast swath of time between the end of the Paleoindian tradition and
the appearance of ceramics around A.D. 500. Archaic cultural history, classification, and
chronology in the region rely to a large extent on frameworks developed in neighboring regions
(e.g., Irwin-Williams 1973, 1979; Johnson and Holliday 2004:290–292; MacNeish 1993;
MacNeish and Beckett 1987; Mallouf 1985, 2005; Sayles 1983; Sayles and Antevs 1941; see also
Huckell 1996:319–323; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:218). Three Archaic periods are widely
recognized in the region: Early Archaic (6000–3200 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3200–1800 B.C.), and
Late Archaic (1800 B.C.–A.D. 500). However, these periods and their bracketing dates do not
correspond very closely to some important changes in climate, subsistence economics, and other
developments over the course of the Archaic tradition. Also, depending on which chronology is
used there is a hiatus lasting anywhere from 500 to 1,000 years between the dates bracketing the
end of the Paleoindian and beginning of the Archaic tradition. There is debate as to the significance
of this apparent hiatus; Irwin-Williams (1979:35) argued that the hiatus reflects migration of
Paleoindian hunters out of the desert Southwest to the north, with desert-adapted hunter-gatherers
from the Great Basin filling in behind them. As with the Paleoindian tradition, identification of
Archaic periods at sites in the region relies primarily on diagnostic projectile points, although the
advent of pit baking led to the creation and enhancement chronometrically datable archaeological
contexts. The result is that we have many radiocarbon dates for the Archaic tradition, and the
identification of components does not rely as much on projectile points as it does for those dating
from Paleoindian times.
The most diagnostic artifacts on Archaic sites are atlatl dart points. These points can vary greatly
in shape and usually appear less well made than Paleoindian points. If the different morphological

types reflect different ethnic or kinship groups, the great variety of point forms from Archaic sites
in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico may indicate that several different Archaic groups
used the area (Phippen et al. 2000:468–470; Sebastian and Larralde 1989:42). Another possibility
is that the different point types reflect reworking and repair of broken points (Flenniken and Wilke
1989). After Paleoindian times there was a transition from lanceolate to mostly stemmed projectile
points, including the Jay and Bajada types of Irwin-Williams’ (1973, 1979) Oshara tradition, and
Uvalde and other types identified in central and west Texas (Prewitt 1981; Turpin 1994:70; Weir
1976; see also Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:220). Scrapers, knives, and chopping tools are common,
although Irwin-Williams (1973, 1979) reports that ground stone was lacking in the Jay phase
(5500–4800 B.C.) and does not mention its occurrence in the subsequent Bajada phase (4800–
3200 B.C.). Ground stone milling tools are reported from Early Archaic contexts in the western
Jornada Mogollon region (MacNeish 1993). Irwin-Williams (1973:6–7) notes the appearance of
cooking pits with burned rock in the Bajada phase, and in west Texas and the western Jornada area
hot-rock cooking and a broad-spectrum subsistence pattern were established during the Early
Archaic period (Dering 1999; Mallouf 1985; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:220–221; Turpin
1994:70).
The Early Archaic period falls mostly or entirely within the Altithermal, an exceptionally dry
interval that apparently led to a drastic reduction of available surface water (Antevs 1948, 1953,
1955; Haynes 1975; Hester 1972; Holliday 1989; Johnson and Holliday 1986, 2004:290–291;
Meltzer 1991). Whether this involved an increase in average temperatures or reduced precipitation
remains somewhat of an open question, but in all likelihood both factors were at play (Meltzer and
Collins 1987). These conditions prevailed for a long interval beginning around 6000 B.C. and
lasted until sometime between 3000 and 2000 B.C. (i.e., into the Middle Archaic period). East of
the Pecos River many springs, marshes, and playa lakes probably dried up during the Altithermal,
leaving available water sources localized and dispersed. This may have led to intensified
competition, starvation, and out-migration on an appreciable scale. At least some of those who
stayed on the Llano Estacado and around its margins resorted to digging water wells at springs and
playas that had dried up, but where water could still be found just below the surface.
During the Middle Archaic period projectile point styles diversify somewhat, both within and
between regions, although in general points have either contracted stems with flat, rounded, or
pointed bases or expanded stems with concave bases (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:225). A broadspectrum subsistence economy was well established by Middle Archaic times, including the use
of low-ranking seeds and roots that require extensive processing prior to consumption. This is
evidenced not only by biotic remains, but also by the common occurrence of ground stone milling
tools, cooking pits, and burned rock in Middle Archaic contexts (Huckell 1996:336–342; Mallouf
1985; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:224–225). The earliest maize in the Southwest dates from the
near the end of the Middle Archaic time frame (Mabry 2005), although no maize or other cultigens
are known for this period in or near the region.
The arid climate of the Altithermal continued into at least the early portion of the Middle Archaic
period (Antevs 1948, 1953, 1955; Haynes 1975; Hester 1972; Johnson and Holliday 1986,
2004:290–291; Meltzer 1991), but conditions improved beginning sometime during the interval
3000–2000 B.C., when the climate became wetter or cooler across the region (Berry and Berry
1986:312–314; Cordell and McBrinn 2012:125; Hogan 1983, 1994; Johnson and Holliday
2004:291; Mehringer 1967; Mehringer et al. 1966; Oldfield and Schoenwetter 1975; Petersen

1981; Smith 2002; Smith and McFaul 1997; Wendlund and Bryson 1974). This led to a
proliferation and resurgence of reliable sources of surface water and a widespread expansion and
enrichment of the available biomass (Johnson and Holliday 2004:291). The improved climatic
conditions are probably largely responsible for a dramatic increase and ubiquity of archaeological
sites and radiocarbon dates, and a much more extensive and ubiquitous distribution of sites across
the landscape that begins in the Middle Archaic period (Berry and Berry 1986; Carmichael 1986;
Mallouf 1985, 2005:219; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:223; Railey et al. 2011; Walth and Railey
2011:352–366). Sites become common in many upland areas, and desert basin floors and plains
away from river corridors, which had been largely unoccupied during the mid-Holocene. At
present, the data suggest some increase in population levels from the Early to Middle Archaic
periods, but the evidence is weak and population levels apparently remained low throughout
Middle Archaic times.
The Late Archaic period (1800 B.C.–A.D. 500) witnessed a continuation and intensification of
trends set in motion following the end of Pleistocene, and in many respects marks a major turning
point in the prehistory of the Southwest and Southern Plains. Diagnostic projectile points are
mostly expanded stem forms with varying blade shapes that may or may not have strong shoulders
(e.g., Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:Figure 7-11), although other styles are found as well, including
bifurcated base and straight-stem forms (Mallouf 2005:226). Maize-based farming becomes
widespread throughout the Southwest as an addition to the broad-spectrum hunting-gathering
subsistence economy (Cordell and McBrinn 2012:136–149; Huckell 1996:343–349). There was
pre-ceramic maize in portions of the Jornada Mogollon region (e.g., Campbell and Railey 2008;
Tagg 1996; Upham et al. 1987; Wills and Huckell 1994:42), but thus far there is no clear evidence
of Late Archaic farming in this portion of west Texas. A proliferation of pit houses, bell-shaped
pits, and sites with middens and abundant artifacts, suggests reduced mobility under increasing
population densities (Huckell 1996:343–349), but again these trends are not evident at present in
the region. In fact, at present there are no discernible structure remains or storage pits known for
the Late Archaic period in the region, rich midden deposits are rare or absent, and the vast majority
of features consist of hearths, roasting pits, and burned-rock middens, the latter mostly west of the
Pecos River. In other words, the archaeological evidence strongly suggests a continuation of highly
mobile, hunter-gatherer lifeways across at least most of the local region during Late Archaic times.
Despite the continuation of a highly mobile, hunter-gatherer lifeway, there were some important
changes and developments in the Late Archaic period of the region. The favorable climatic trend
that began during Middle Archaic times continued into the Late Archaic period, with the cooler
and wetter conditions resulting in an increased biomass and proliferation of new water sources
across the landscape (cf., Berry and Berry 1986:312–314; Cordell and McBrinn 2012:125; Hogan
1983, 1994; Johnson and Holliday 2004:291; Mehringer 1967; Mehringer et al. 1966; Oldfield and
Schoenwetter 1975; Petersen 1981; Polyak and Asmerom 2001; Smith 2002; Smith and McFaul
1997; Wendlund and Bryson 1974). The vast plains east of the Pecos River were probably too dry
for intensive and efficient foraging during the Early Archaic and most of the Middle Archaic
period, but by Late Archaic times hunter-gatherers in the region were beginning to fully realize
the potential of the landscape’s enriched resource abundance. The widespread occurrence of
freshwater mussel shell at many sites across the landscape suggests the possibility that aquatic
habitats occurred along many now-dry drainages in the region, most of which were probably also
dry during the Altithermal. Among other things the favorable climate and enhanced biomass that

April 2018

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of a 5.46-Mile Segment of the Proposed Orla Residue Gas Pipeline on
Texas Public Lands in Reeves County, Texas

continued into Late Archaic times included an enrichment of grassland habitats, which apparently
resulted in increased numbers of bison and a new round of bison hunting over a broad region.
Archaeological evidence suggests the improved climatic conditions of Late Archaic times had two
important effects within the region: 1) a sharp population increase and 2) new foraging
opportunities for hunter-gatherers that allowed for more ubiquitous use of the landscape through
residential mobility. The dramatic increase in Late Archaic components and radiocarbon dates
indicates intensified and more ubiquitous exploitation of the landscape. This is part of a broad
pattern across the Southwest and Southern Plains, in which people expanded into all ecological
zones, including once-marginal ones such as uplands and intermountain desert basins (Berry and
Berry 1986; Carmichael 1986; Mallouf 1985, 2005:219; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:226; Railey
et al. 2011; Walth and Railey 2011:352–366). Similarly, in the region not only do site components,
dates, and diagnostic artifacts increase sharply at this time, but they are also distributed widely
across the landscape. In terms of hunter-gatherer mobility and subsistence, these patterns are
probably the result of the improved climatic conditions, population growth, and changes in
mobility. The more common availability of surface water, and increased resource abundance
across the landscape, meant that hunter-gatherers could now forage more efficiently, moving their
camps more frequently around the landscape. This strategy would have decreased the distance and
time involved in daily foraging trips, translating into a greater return of caloric intake per unit of
energy expended (cf. Kelly 1995:111–148). Archaeologically this would all result in higher
numbers, and a more ubiquitous distribution of, preserved camp remains (such as artifact scatters
and cooking pits), relative to previous time periods. This is precisely what we see for the Late
Archaic period in the region.

3.1.3 FORMATIVE TRADITION (A.D. 500–1450)
“Formative” is a term commonly applied by archaeologists to the ceramic periods of the Jornada
Mogollon region (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:236–237). The well-dated sequence of sites in the
Hondo Valley, northwest of the region, suggests that ceramics appeared there around A.D. 500
(Campbell and Railey 2008), and this date is used here for the beginning of the Formative tradition.
The addition of ceramics to the inventory of artifacts provides a tremendous advantage in
recognizing Formative period site components as compared to pre-ceramic ones. Ceramics also
enhance temporal resolution and age estimates of site components, especially for the more
distinctive, painted wares that can cross-date between different regions. For this discussion, the
Formative tradition is simply divided into two periods: Early (ca. A.D. 500–1100) and Late
Formative (ca. A.D. 1100–1450), with the appearance of Chupadero Black-on-white being the
most prominent marker separating the two. Phase divisions within these periods can certainly be
suggested based in part on the appearance of certain key marker traits, such as early black-onwhite ceramics toward the end of the Early Formative, and a variety of distinctive glaze ware and
polychromes after ca. A.D. 1300. But the development of well-established phase sequences will
depend on excavation data from more sites with securely dated, single-component contexts. The
early centuries of the Formative time frame witnessed little change in subsistence and mobility
from the Late Archaic. But significant changes did occur in the Late Formative period, although
for the general region some of the more important Late Formative developments are inferred from
surrounding regions, and further research will hopefully clarify the specifics of these in the project
region.

Two prominent changes in artifact assemblages mark the beginning of the Early Formative period.
One is the appearance of ceramics, which in the beginning consist of undecorated brown wares.
These are variously classified according to paste characteristics as Jornada Brown, McKenzie
Brown, Middle Pecos Micaceous Brown, South Pecos Brown, and Alma Plain (Hill 1996, 2000,
2001; Hogan 2006; Jelinek 1967; Katz and Katz 1985, 1993, 2001; Kelley 1984; Leslie 1979;
Mera 1943; Reed et al. 2002:550–551; Runyan and Hedrick 1987; Whalen 1981; Wilson 2000a,
2000b, 2003; Wiseman 1996, 2002), and which persist well into Late Formative time frame. Early
black-on-white ceramics (e.g., Cebolleta, Red Mesa, Mimbres) appear in the region after ca. A.D.
750 (Katz and Katz 1993), but do not occur at all sites in the later centuries of the Early Formative,
and undecorated brown wares continue to dominate ceramic assemblages throughout the period.
The introduction of the bow and arrow is inferred from a sharp reduction in the size of projectile
points, which occurs across most of sub-boreal North American around A.D. 500–600 (Bettinger
and Eerkens 1999; Bettinger and Taylor 1974; Blitz 1988:130–132; Cordell 1979:134, 1997;
Guernsey 1931:71–72, 99, 107; Huckell 1998; Justice 2002:44; Lipe 1978:369; Nassaney and Pyle
1999; Railey 2010; Seeman 1992; Shott 1993; Torres 2000:227; VanPool 2006:433; Yerkes and
Pecora 1991). In the Southwest and Southern Plains, the earliest arrow points are strongly
shouldered, corner-notched or stemmed forms. At the well-dated series of sites in the Hondo
Valley of the Sierra Blanca highlands (Campbell and Railey 2008; Railey 2010), the earliest arrow
points have shouldered, recurved blades similar to the Bonham and Homan types in northeast
Texas (Turner and Hester 1993:202, 219), and these are quickly followed by straight-bladed points
with tanged shoulders and corner notching. The latter forms, similar to the Scallorn type of the
Plains (Turner and Hester 1993:230) and the Trujillo and Dolores types in northern New Mexico
(Justice 2002; Turnbow 1997:202–205), persist throughout the remainder of the Early Formative
period and continue into the early portion of the Late Formative.
Except for the addition of ceramics and arrow points, Early Formative artifact assemblages remain
similar to those of the Late Archaic, with a variety of flaked stone tools and ground stone milling
implements. Other aspects of the Early Formative archaeological record also persist from Late
Archaic times. There is still a notable dearth of preserved house remains; the few dating from the
Early Formative period in the region come from just four sites (Jones et al. 2010; Railey 2011;
Zamora 2000), and their characteristics suggest rather expedient, wickiup-like brush huts set in
shallow basins. The lack of evidence for substantially constructed houses prior to the Late
Formative suggests people across at least most of the region did not invest heavily in residential
architecture, and this is typical of highly mobile hunter-gatherers (Binford 1990; Kelly 1995:139–
140).
Botanical remains of various wild plants, including cheno-ams, wild barley, and others are
common occurrences (e.g., Acklen and Railey 2001; Brown 2011; Condon et al. 2008; Lord and
Reynolds 1985; Railey 2011), along with succulents processed in burned-rock middens in the
western portion of the region (Jones et al. 2010). Unlike the Late Archaic, in the region there is
one instance of charred maize associated with a radiocarbon date for the Early Formative, at a site
in the Guadalupe Mountains (Kemrer 1998). Otherwise, at present there is a complete lack of
domesticates in macrobotanical assemblages in securely dated, pre-Late Formative contexts, and
this indicates that farming was not an important part of the subsistence economy (or was not
practiced at all) across most of the region during Early Formative times.

The onset of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (A.D. 800/900–1350) reportedly ushered in a dry
period that heavily impacted people across much of western North America (Jones et al. 1999).
The data suggest that people responded to this drastic climatic change by withdrawing to areas
where reliable sources of surface water could still be found, which includes the Pecos River and,
apparently, playas, areas below escarpment edges (most notably along the base of the Mescalero
Escarpment, where freshwater springs probably continued to issue forth), and in the Mountain
Slope area. In the latter area, most of the dates are from burned-rock middens, so the numbers may
also indicate an upswing in the use of these sites and exploitation of low-rank, high-cost food
resources processed at them (see Dering 1999). Although precipitation levels apparently increased
again toward the end of the Early Formative, the damage apparently was already done, and the
response to the period of severe drought may have helped prompt some fundamental changes in
cultural adaptations that took hold during the subsequent Late Formative period.
The Late Formative period indeed witnessed some of the most profound changes in the prehistory
of the region. In terms of artifacts, the most prominent temporal indices of this period are a variety
of distinct and relatively well-dated decorated ceramic types. Chupadero Black-on-white and El
Paso painted (bichrome and early polychromes, and later just El Paso polychrome) are present by
the beginning of this period, or soon after, eventually edge out undecorated brown wares, and
persist as common types throughout the Late Formative time frame (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:252–253; Speth and Newlander 2012; Wilson 2000b). Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta is
another distinctive type that appears in the region around the beginning of the Late Formative
period, but is less common than the Chupadero and El Paso painted wares (Runyan and Hedrick
1987). Chupadero wares were manufactured in the Sierra Blanca highlands (Clark 2006; Creel et
al. 2002; Reed et al. 2002). Also from this region is Corona Corrugated, a utilitarian ware that
appears around or soon after A.D. 1200 (Kelley 1984; Wiseman 2002). St. Johns Polychrome
appears at about this same time (Miller 1995; Runyan and Hedrick 1987). After A.D. 1300, exotic
ceramic types from a variety of areas in the Southwest appear in west Texas and southeastern New
Mexico, including Rio Grande glaze wares, Lincoln Black-on-red from the Sierra Blanca
highlands in New Mexico, Ramos Polychrome from the Casas Grandes area, and Gila Polychrome
from the Salado region (Katz and Katz 1993; Miller 1995). Another post-A.D. 1300 ceramic type
is Ochoa Indented, a Southern Plains type that appears to be restricted to areas east of the Pecos
River (Katz and Katz 1993).
Also occurring in the Late Formative period is a widely documented shift in arrow point
morphology during the thirteenth century. The earlier, corner-notched arrow point styles with
strong shoulders are replaced by side-notched arrow points with wide, squared, or concave bases.
These late forms are usually referred to as Harrell, Desert Side-notched, Washita, or Pueblo Sidenotched (Justice 2002; Speth 2004; Turnbow 1997; Turner and Hester 1993). Unnotched triangular
points are rare in the Southwest, but do occur in the Plains (and are especially common in eastern
North America) and spill over in small numbers into the project vicinity. In Texas these are usually
referred to as Fresno points, and their reported time span (ca. A.D. 800–1700) is not as restricted
as those for the other arrow point types discussed above. There is evidence to suggest that these
unnotched triangular points are actually preforms that were intended to be finished and notched,
and they were widely transported as they were less fragile and susceptible to breakage than finished
points (cf. Chesier and Kelly 2006; Dawe 1987; Newlander and Speth 2009).

By A.D. 1300, if not earlier, substantially occupied “villages” were established across much of the
larger region. This was part of widespread pattern of greater sedentism and village formation
across the southern Great Plains and Jornada Mogollon region in the early to mid-second
millennium A.D. (Brooks 2004; Campbell 1976; Drass 1998; Drass and Flynn 1990; Jelinek 1967;
Kalasz et al. 1999:195–198; Kelley 1984; Lintz 1984, 1986, 1991; Lutes 1959; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004; Speth 2004, 2005; Speth and Newlander 2012; Wendorf 1960; Wiseman 1981,
1985, 2002; Zamora and Oakes 2000). Most of what we know about Late Formative “village” sites
in the region comes from excavations carried out decades ago, using pre-modern methods. A
cluster of villages were occupied in the project vicinity at the Andrews Lake site, several of which
have been excavated (Collins 1966, 1968). Jennings (1940) excavations at Rio Peñasco and two
neighboring sites provide a glimpse of Late Formative village life in the Mountain Slope area.
Decades ago the Lea County Archaeological Society (LCAS) excavated several village sites,
including Boot Hill (Corley and Leslie 1960) and Laguna Plata (LCAS 1971). Eastern New
Mexico University’s subsequent excavations at Laguna Plata (Haskell 1977) and TRC’s recent
investigations at Laguna Plata (Brown 2010) and Boot Hill (Brown 2011) added additional
information about these two important sites. In addition, as part of the BLM CFO Permian Basin
Mitigation Program in New Mexico, recent investigations were carried out at the Maroon Cliffs, a
sprawling site complex west of the project area that includes substantial remains of Late Formation
occupations (Stowe and Condon 2012). Survey-level investigations have also documented sites
with intensive Late Formative occupations in the Mescalero Plain and Escarpment Base areas.
These include Indian Hill (LA 32228, also known as Taylor Peak), where a burial, a pit house, and
charred maize were found (Hunt 1989), and a sprawling site complex in the vicinity of the
Merchant site (Lone Mountain Archaeological Services [LMAS] 2001). Late Formative village
sites tend to occur in areas where springs, precipitation runoff, or playa lakes offered reliable
sources of surface water, and at least limited riparian environments and associated resources. The
base of the Mescalero Escarpment was an especially favored zone for these sites.
As far as detailed information pertaining to the role of maize in Late Formative subsistence
economies of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, the closest comparative evidence we have
to date comes from two settlements west of Roswell, New Mexico: Henderson and Bloom Mound
(Kelley 1984; Powell 2001; Speth 2004, 2005). For these sites, the evidence
points to farming as a modest contributor to the diet throughout, with little or no indication
of significant intensification in the later part of the sequence (e.g., small numbers of
recovered maize remains; ubiquity and abundance of wild seeds; carbon isotope values
indicating modest overall intake of C4 plants; low incidence of [dental] caries; small
numbers of metates, mostly basin-shaped; and wholly unstandardized one- and twohanded manos). (Speth and LeDuc 2007:46)
Another important subsistence trend that inhabitants of these Late Formative villages were caught
up in was an increased emphasis on bison hunting across the region and elsewhere in the southern
Plains after ca. A.D. 1250, following a regional hiatus in bison hunting that began in A.D. 500
(Baugh 1986; Bozell 1995; Brooks 2004; Collins 1968, 1971; Creel 1991; Dillehay 1974; Drass
and Flynn 1990; Greer 1976; Hughes 1989; Jelinek 1967; Speth 1979, 1983, 1984, 2004; Speth
and Parry 1978, 1980; Spielmann 1991; Staley 1996). At some point during the Formative time
frame, people on the Plains began killing bison beyond what was required for their own subsistence
and other resource needs, and traded hides, dried meat, and perhaps other products to the more

settled farmers to the west (Creel 1991; Speth 2004, 2005; Speth and Newlander 2012; Spielmann
1991). Creel (1991) argues that this regional exchange system was underway around or soon after
A.D. 1300, with the key archaeological indicators being the appearance in the southern Plains of
numerous beveled knives and endscrapers that were used to process bison hides.
As for far west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, at present we have mostly indirect evidence
as to the role of Late Formative peoples in the Pueblo-Plains interaction sphere. Creel (1991:41)
reports that this exchange system extended all the way down to present-day Chihuahua. Occasional
bison remains also appear in Late Formative sites in the western Jornada Mogollon (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:250), and it seems likely that bison hides (which would not show up in the faunal
record) were probably traded to the people of the El Paso phase (A.D. 1250/1300–1450). Late
Formative villagers in west Texas and far southeastern New Mexico would have been well
positioned as the most likely suppliers of bison products to the western Jornada Mogollon and
settled groups further to the south. But it still remains an open question whether, and if so to what
extent, Late Formative villagers developed an export economy fueled by bison products. Further
research is needed to elucidate the details pertaining to this question.

3.1.4 POST-FORMATIVE (A.D. 1450–1500)
The Post-Formative begins with the widespread abandonment of late prehistoric villages in the
southern Plains around A.D. 1450, as groups throughout the region shifted to a more nomadic
lifeway centered more squarely on bison hunting (Baugh 1986; Bozell 1995; Brooks 2004; Collins
1968, 1971; Creel 1991; Dillehay 1974; Drass and Flynn 1990; Greer 1976; Hughes 1989; Jelinek
1967; Speth 1979, 1983, 1984, 2004; Speth and Parry 1978, 1980; Spielmann 1991).
Archaeologically, this period is somewhat of a phantom, as many of the diagnostic ceramic types
largely disappeared along with village sites. Ceramics are either absent in the region at this time
or, to the extent they were still in use, consist of types that are largely unknown (Katz and Katz
1993). Side-notched arrow points, similar to those that appeared after A.D. 1200 (see above),
continued into this period until an unknown date and were eventually replaced by metal arrow
points and firearms.
As part of the shift to nomadism during post-Formative times, it is reasonable to expect that tipis
became a more common dwelling form. Seymour (2002, 2004; LMAS 2001) has identified tipi
rings in both the western Jornada Mogollon and far southeastern New Mexico. She argues that tipi
rings in the region are very late in time, postdating other types of structures, and even concludes
that at least some are late nineteenth century Apache or Comanche dwellings. Such conclusions
lack supporting evidence, however (see Kenmotsu et al. 2009:96–97). Tipi rings date back several
thousand years on the Plains, and it is entirely possible that at least some tipi rings in the project
vicinity predate the post-Formative time frame.
By A.D. 1500, if not earlier, people on the southern Plains had given up their attempts at village
life, with its mixed focus on farming and bison hunting, and had become nomadic, tipi-dwelling
bison hunters. This probably occurred at least in part due to increased demand from the pueblos
for bison products and other resources from the southern Plains (such as Alibates and Edwards
chert). One intriguing trend that may characterize post-Formative occupations in the region of
project area is the increased use of obsidian, most of which appears to derive from sources in
northern Chihuahua and southwestern New Mexico (Kenmotsu et al. 2009:92). This apparent trend

was also noted in the Middle Pecos River valley (northwest of the region) by Jelinek (1967).
Within the project region, however, Jemez Mountain obsidians are also found in apparent
protohistoric contexts, although the source of these could actually be Rio Grande gravels in the
western Jornada Mogollon region (Stein 2011).

3.2 HISTORIC CHRONOLOGY
The historic period began with the first Spanish expeditions through the region in the sixteenth
through eighteenth centuries. In 1582–1583, Antonio de Espejo led an expedition to the upper
reaches of the Rio Grande and Pecos River before returning southward along the latter (Bolton
1908:189–190; Snow 1992:235–236).
In 1589 to 1590, Gaspar de Sosa, the lieutenant-governor of Nuevo Leon, led a large, but
unauthorized, colonizing party through west Texas, evidently following the Pecos River (Chipman
1992:58). For violating settlement policies, a viceregal agent captured and returned de Sosa to
Mexico. After being convicted, he was exiled to the Philippines where he died in a slave revolt.
In 1683, Dominguez de Mendoza, with a mandate to look for pearls, trade possibilities, and
instilling respect for friars among the native people, led a group of soldiers from La Junta to the
Pecos River (Chipman 1992:70), probably following Espejo’s route. After arriving at the Pecos
River, the expedition traveled “downstream for nine leagues to a point near Horsehead Crossing”
(Chipman 1992:70), where they turned eastward.
In 1787, Juan de Ugalde led an extensive expedition through the region in an effort to subdue the
Apache threat. Ugalde’s expedition was part of a new Spanish policy for securing the northern
frontier. The Spaniards threatened military force, but also offered the Apaches protection from the
Comanche as an inducement for peace. The Comanche, however, as well as Apache groups,
dominated the area well into the late nineteenth century.

3.2.1 REEVES COUNTY
The first Anglo farmers arrived in Toyah Valley in 1871, when George B. and Robert E. Lyle
began irrigating crops from Toyah Creek. Open range ranching first attracted white settlers to the
Davis Mountains in 1875. By 1881 the Texas and Pacific Railway built tracks through Reeves
County. At that time section houses were constructed at Pecos and Toyah, which opened a post
office that year and later became a shipping point for local ranchers. Pecos was named the seat of
government when Reeves County was separated from Pecos County in 1883 and organized in
1884. Ranching and agricultural pursuits were the main economic activities of county.

Orla
Orla is on the former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (now BNSF Railway) line, U.S. Highway
285, and Farm Road 652, 8 km (5 miles) southeast of Red Bluff in northwestern Reeves County.
The name is Spanish for “border” and refers to the countryside around the settlement. Orla was
established as a section house on the Pecos River Railroad in 1890. A post office was opened there
in 1906. By 1933 Orla reported the post office, a business, and a population of 10. Its population
remained at t10 until after World War II, but the number of businesses increased to two in 1943.
The town grew between the late 1940s and the 1950s, the population to 40 and then to 60, and the
SWCA Environmental Consultants

21

April 2018

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of a 5.46-Mile Segment of the Proposed Orla Residue Gas Pipeline on
Texas Public Lands in Reeves County, Texas

number of businesses to three. In the mid-1960s Orla became a rural oil supply center. By the end
of the decade its population had reached 250, and it had 12 businesses. From 1970 through 2000
its population was reported at 183, and it had variously anywhere from one to 16 businesses. In
1990 Orla still supplied equipment for production in nearby Permian Basin oilfields.

Pecos
Pecos, Texas, is the closest large town to the project area and is the county seat of Reeves County,
adjacent and to the west of the Pecos River. Initially, the settlement was east of the Pecos River,
used as camp for cattle drives. The growing town moved to the west side of the Pecos River and
George Knight “offered Texas and Pacific Railway a location for a depot and a gift of several town
blocks. The railroad accepted his offer and built its tracks through the area in 1881. The town was
called first Pecos Station, then Pecos City, and finally Pecos” (Smith 2017). The population
steadily grew with a population of 150 in 1885, 639 in 1904, and 1,856 by 1914. At its
incorporation in 1929, Pecos had 4,000. During World War II, the Pecos Army Air Field and a
number of other military installations in the vicinity brought in new residents, with the population
growing steadily and in 2000 the population was 9,501. Today, Pecos is a ranching, farming, and
oilfield center and is home to the annual West of the Pecos Rodeo and the West of the Pecos
Museum (Smith 2017).

4 RESEARCH DESIGN
4.1 BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA conducted a thorough cultural resources background review and literature search of the
project area and surrounding 3.2-km-wide (2-mile-wide) study area (1.6 km [1 mile] on either side
of the pipeline centerline). On January 6, 2017, SWCA archaeologist Kimberly A. Parker examined
relevant portions of the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas). This source provided
information on the nature and location of previously conducted archaeological surveys and the
location of previously recorded cultural resources, including NRHP districts and properties, sites
designated as SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks,
cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys. As a part of the review, Ms. Parker reviewed the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay, a mapping/geographic information
system (GIS) database with historic maps and resource information covering most portions of the
state (Foster et al. 2006). Aerial photographs were also reviewed to assist in identifying any
potential cultural resources and disturbances.

4.2 FIELD METHODS
Since all land surveyed is on lands managed by Texas General Land Office (GLO), official state
permitting under the ACT was required before initiation of work. The cultural resource survey was
performed with an old landownership layer based on the Texas GLO file. Land ownership details
changed once civil survey shot in the survey markers for the proposed project. Discrepancies in
the land ownership files resulted in SWCA inadvertently surveying small portions of private lands.
Sites 41RV111 and 41RV114 straddle both private and GLO Lands.
The general survey consisted of a crew of two archaeologists walking the 61-m-wide (200-footwide) study area, examining the ground surface, documenting modifications and disturbances, and
using shovel tests and erosional exposures to assess the potential for subsurface archaeological
deposits, as well as assessing the geomorphic setting of the area. Shovel tests were excavated in
areas that 1) did not show signs of extensive prior disturbance, 2) consisted of soils believed to
have a potential for buried deposits close enough to the surface to be detected through this method
of subsurface investigation, and 3) where ground surface visibility was less than 30 percent.
In total, 39 shovel tests were excavated in support of the project. Prior to conducting fieldwork,
NRCS (2017) soil surveys within the project area and geologic maps were consulted in order to
assess the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits. THC archaeological standards specify that
a minimum of 16 shovel tests are required per mile within a survey corridor of 30.5 m (100 feet)
unless surface visibility is greater than 30 percent. Shovel tests are implemented in order to
determine the presence or absence of buried cultural deposits deeper than 10 cm, or deeper than
depths normally accessible through trowel testing, and therefore to support or negate
recommendations of site eligibility. Areas with the potential for buried deposits were identified
and subsequently assessed in the field. The SWCA survey placed 37 shovel tests across four newly
documented sites and two additional shovel tests within the survey corridor. Shovel tests were
excavated 11 to 100 cm below the ground surface (cmbs) and were terminated when subsurface
artifacts, features, or pre-Holocene sub-soils (caliche layers) were encountered. Matrix fill was

sifted through ¼-inch mesh screen. Shovel tests were typically not performed when the surface
visibility was greater than 30 percent. Locations and results of the shovel tests excavated within
archaeological sites are included in Appendix B.
Field conditions, such as exposed bedrock, deflated areas, and existing disturbances, ultimately
determined where shovel testing was warranted. Each shovel test measured roughly 30 × 30 cm in
size and was excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth unless soil characteristics or
bedrock precluded reaching that depth. The matrix from each shovel test was screened through ¼inch mesh, and the location of each excavation was plotted using a handheld, sub-meter accurate
Trimble global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
Because this was a non-collection survey, any artifacts discovered were tabulated, analyzed, and
documented in the field, but not collected. Temporally diagnostic artifacts, if present, were to be
described in detail and photographed in the field.

5 RESULTS
5.1 BACKGROUND REVIEW RESULTS
The background review determined that no cultural resources surveys are known to have been
conducted in areas intersecting the project area, and no cultural resource sites have been recorded
within the project area. However, three archaeological sites (41RV87, 41RV88, and 41RV92) are
mapped within a 1.6-km (1-mile) radius of the project area, but none of these sites are adjacent to,
or intersect, the currently proposed project area (Table 5.1).

5.2 FIELD SURVEY AND RESULTS
SWCA conducted a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey of the various project elements on
GLO lands including a 61-m-wide (200-foot-wide) corridor centered on the approximately 38.22km-long (23.75-mile-long) proposed pipeline alignment centerline provided by Enterprise (see
Appendix A). Field investigations for the current project took place on February 16–18, February
21, February 28–March 2, and April 11, 2017. Survey efforts were augmented with shovel testing
and inspection of any available erosional profiles. In total, 39 shovel tests were excavated
throughout the survey corridor and archaeological sites (see Appendix B).
The intensive cultural resources investigations examined a total of 157.87 acres. In total, the survey
of the proposed pipeline alignment resulted in the documentation of four newly recorded cultural
resource sites (41RV111–41RV114) (Table 5.2). See the Site Descriptions section of this report
for further discussion of these sites.

Site Description
Site 41RV111 is a lithic artifact scatter and thermal feature (Figure 5.1–Figure 5.6, see Figure A.1
in Appendix A). The site was identified along a bladed two-track road and pipeline corridor on a
flat upland plain with early-stage coppice dunes. Only the portion of the site within the survey
corridor was investigated. The cultural resource survey was performed with an old land ownership
layer based on the Texas GLO file. Land ownership details changed once civil survey shot in the
survey markers for the proposed project. Discrepancies in the land ownership files resulted in
SWCA inadvertently surveying a small portion of private lands. Site 41RV111 was identified
straddling these private lands and GLO Lands. The site measures 34.5 (northeast-southwest) ×
29.9 m (northwest-southeast) (113 × 98 feet) within the survey corridor but extends southwest
outside the corridor for an unknown distance. Ground visibility is good, ranging between 70 and
95 percent during the site visit, partially limited by yucca, creosote bush, and bunch grasses, with
lesser amounts of mesquite, prickly pear, and Mormon tea. Surface deposits appear to be a mix of

yellowish brown, loose silty sand. The site is 70 percent intact, with natural impacts primarily from
eolian processes shifting sediments across the ground surface. Artificial impacts to the site include
the pipeline corridor through the northeast portion of the site and the two-track road.
Feature 1 is a soil stain with charcoal flecking and four pieces of burned caliche that is located on
Private land. The stain was observed on the side of the bladed two-track road and extending into
the roadway. No additional evidence of subsurface deposits was present. Six shovel tests were
negative for subsurface cultural materials. The artifact assemblage at 41RV111 consists of 115
lithic artifacts. No diagnostic artifacts were identified.

Features
Feature 1 is a thermal feature located on private land. Approximately 75 to 100 pieces of burned
caliche and fire-affected rock are scattered across the site outside a feature context (Figure 5.7 and
Figure 5.8). One soil stain with intact charcoal flecking and four pieces of burned caliche was

Materials Identified
The artifact assemblage at 41RV111 is dominated by lithic debitage (Table 5.3). Analysis of the
debitage indicates that approximately 37 percent (n = 38) is flakes with 50 percent cortex or more,
approximately 28 percent (n = 28) is flakes with less than 50 percent cortex, approximately 20
percent (n = 20) is non-cortical flakes, and there are 15 pieces of cortical shatter (15 percent). Also
identified at the site was an edge-modified flake (PL 1), a biface (PL 2), one core (red
orthoquartzite), and four tested cobbles (chert, rhyolite, and quartzite). Lithic materials are all
locally available and consist of chert, chalcedony, quartzite, orthoquartzite, and limestone. No
diagnostic artifacts were observed. PL 1 is a broken tan chert flake measuring 2.9 × 2.7 × 0.9 cm,
modified with unifacial flaking on one lateral edge. PL 2 is a brown chert mid-stage biface
measuring 5.8 × 3.9 × 1.2 cm, with a random flaking pattern and approximately 30 percent cortex
(Figure 5.9).

Site Chronology
Because no diagnostic artifacts were identified at 41RV111, it is not possible to assign a temporal
affiliation to the site beyond unknown aboriginal (< A.D. 1800). While the site most likely dates
to the prehistoric period, the protohistoric or early historic periods cannot be dismissed. Further
testing of the charcoal deposits in Feature 1 may refine the chronology for the site.
Site Interpretation and Summary
Site 41RV111 is a lithic artifact scatter and a thermal feature of unknown cultural affiliation and
age. The current investigation only recorded the portion of the site intersecting the survey corridor
for the proposed project. In this area, 41RV111 is 70 percent intact, with impacts from eolian
processes and an existing pipeline corridor and two-track road. Based on the suite of artifacts and
presence of a thermal feature, the site is tentatively interpreted as a short-term campsite, though
exploration of the remainder of the site could alter this hypothesis.

Eligibility Recommendations
Site 41RV111 is a medium-density lithic artifact scatter and thermal feature with intact deposits.
The site is approximately 35.45 km (22 miles) south of the New Mexico-Texas state line on an
upland plain in a dune and blowout environment, about 14 km (8.7 miles) west of the Pecos River.
Site 41RV111 is not associated with any significant event or person and is therefore not eligible
under Criteria A or B. Its construction does not embody the work of a master and is therefore not
eligible under Criterion C. The site retains diminished integrity of location, setting, and feeling
because the landscape and vegetation reflect some changes from the times the site was likely
utilized. Site 41RV111 has diminished integrity of design and materials, and lacks integrity of
workmanship because discrete use areas are not indicated in the site expression. The site lacks
integrity of association because the artifact assemblage cannot be linked to a specific cultural group
or time period. Six shovel tests placed within the survey area were negative, and the site is heavily
disturbed. However, intact dateable deposits in Feature 1 suggest additional information potential
for 41RV111. Based on these deposits in Feature 1, SWCA recommends that further investigation
at the site is likely to yield information that will further our understanding of the prehistory of the
area. Therefore, 41RV111 is recommended eligible to the NRHP under Criterion D. However, the
portion of the site within the survey area outside of Feature 1 is considered to be non-contributing
to NRHP eligibility.
Management Recommendations
A 2.4-m (8-foot) pad will be placed on top of Feature 1, which is located on Private land, and its
surroundings to prevent impacts to the feature. The feature is located partially within a two-track
road on private land within the temporary workspace. No further management within the proposed
project corridor is recommended with regard to the current undertaking.

Site Description
Site 41RV112 is a lithic procurement site and artifact scatter (Figure 5.10–Figure 5.17, see Figure
A.1 in Appendix A). The site was identified atop a small hill within an upland plain. Only the
portion of the site within the survey corridor was investigated. The site measures 161 m (northwestsoutheast) × 61 m (northeast-southwest) (528 × 200 feet) within the survey corridor, but the site
extends outside the corridor for an unknown distance. Ground visibility is good, ranging between
65 and 90 percent during the site visit, partially limited by creosote bush and bunch grasses, with
lesser amounts of mesquite. Surface deposits appear to be a mix of yellowish brown, loose loam
and sandy loam. The site is 40 percent intact within the survey corridor with eolian processes
shifting sediments downslope off the hill top and a 30-m-wide (98-foot-wide) pipeline corridor
that overlaps most of the proposed APE.
The analyzed artifact assemblage at 41RV112 consists of 100 lithic artifacts. Most of the artifacts
were concentrated on the hill top; no diagnostic artifacts were identified. No features were
identified and no additional evidence of subsurface deposits was present. Eleven shovel tests were
placed throughout the site and excavated to depths between 11 and 36 cmbs; all were negative for
subsurface cultural materials.

Features
No features are present at site 41RV112.
Materials Identified
All lithic tools, cores, and tested cobbles at 41RV112 were analyzed and recorded, as was a sample
of 100 pieces of lithic debitage. Lithic raw materials are local varieties of chalcedony, chert,
orthoquartzite, and quartzite with lesser amounts of sandstone and petrified wood. Analysis of the
debitage indicates that 40 percent (n = 40) is flakes with 50 percent cortex or more, 33 percent (n
= 33) is flakes with less than 50 percent cortex, 4 percent (n = 4) is non-cortical flakes, and there
are six pieces of cortical shatter (6 percent). Lithic tools identified at 41RV112 consisted of two
edge-modified cobbles (PL 1 and PL 4), two bifaces (PL 2 and PL 3), and a side scraper (PL 5),
along with 19 edge-modified flakes. Tools are described in Table 5.4 through Table 5.6 and shown
in Figure 5.18 and Figure 5.19. Four cores (orthoquartzite, chalcedony, and chert) and seven tested
cobbles (chalcedony, chert, orthoquartzite, and quartzite) were also recorded. The edge-modified
flakes were tallied and mapped, but were not point located.

Site Chronology
Artifacts observed across 41RV112 suggest a prehistoric occupation of the site, but the lack of
diagnostic artifacts precludes a more definitive statement. Therefore, it is not possible to assign a
temporal affiliation to the site beyond unknown aboriginal (< A.D. 1800).
Site Interpretation and Summary
No features were identified at 41RV112. The documented artifact assemblage suggests lithic
material procurement, lithic reduction, and tool manufacture occurred at the site. The current
investigation only recorded the portion of the site intersecting the survey corridor for the proposed
project. In this area, 41RV112 is 40 percent intact, with impacts from eolian processes and an
existing pipeline corridor. Based on the suite of artifacts and site location on a hill top with dense
cobbles and gravels, 41RV112 is tentatively interpreted as an opportunistic lithic raw material
procurement site, though exploration of the remainder of the site could alter this hypothesis.
Eligibility Recommendations
Site 41RV112 is a medium-density lithic artifact scatter. The site is approximately 42.23 km (26.24
miles) south of the New Mexico-Texas state line on an upland plain along a hill top, about 4.76
km (2.96 miles) from the Pecos River. Site 41RV112 is not associated with any significant event
or person and is therefore not eligible under Criteria A or B. Its construction does not embody the
work of a master and is therefore not eligible under Criterion C. The site retains diminished
integrity of location, setting, and feeling because the landscape and vegetation reflect some
changes from when the site was likely utilized. Site 41RV112 has diminished integrity of design
and materials, and lacks integrity of workmanship because discrete use areas are not indicated in
the site expression. The site lacks integrity of association because the artifact assemblage cannot
be linked to a specific cultural group or time period. No features were identified at the site and 11
shovel tests were negative for subsurface cultural materials. Further investigation of the portion of
the site within the proposed project corridor is not likely to yield information that will enhance our
understanding of prehistoric lifeways in the region. However, 41RV112 was investigated only

where it intersects the proposed project corridor and it is possible that investigation outside the
proposed project corridor could change this assessment. Therefore, 41RV112 is recommended not
eligible within the proposed project corridor; an overall recommendation of eligibility is
undetermined pending further investigation of the site.
Management Recommendations
No further management within the proposed project corridor is recommended with regard to the
current undertaking.

Site Description
Site 41RV113 is a lithic procurement site and artifact scatter (Figure 5.20–Figure 5.25, see Figure
A.1 in Appendix A). The site extends along a small hill top within an upland plain. Slopes to the
east and west range between 3 and 5 degrees. The survey corridor crosses the northern portion of
the site, and only the portion of the site within the survey corridor was investigated. In this area,
41RV113 measures 91 m (east-west) × 49 m (north-south) (299 × 161 feet) but the site likely
continues along the hill top and outside the corridor for an unknown distance to the south. Ground
visibility is good, ranging between 60 and 80 percent, partially limited by creosote bush and broom
snakeweed, with scattered mesquite and various forbs. Surface deposits appear to be a mix of
yellowish brown sand. Within the site corridor, 41RV113 is 30 percent intact with minor eolian
processes shifting sediments downslope off the hill top and significant impacts from a 30-m-wide
(98-foot-wide) pipeline corridor that overlaps most of the proposed APE in the northern portion
of the site.
The artifact assemblage at 41RV113 consists of 67 lithic artifacts. Most of the artifacts were
concentrated on the hill top; no diagnostic artifacts were identified. No features were identified
and no additional evidence of subsurface deposits was present. Eight shovel tests were placed
throughout the site and excavated to depths between 18 and 43 cmbs; all were negative for
subsurface cultural materials.

Materials Identified
All artifacts at 41RV113 were analyzed and recorded. The assemblage consists primarily of lithic
debitage (n = 55) (Table 5.7). Analysis of the debitage indicates that 45 percent (n = 25) is flakes
with 50 percent cortex or more, 18 percent (n = 10) is flakes with less than 50 percent cortex, 11
percent (n = 6) is non-cortical flakes, and 14 pieces are cortical shatter (25 percent each). Also
recorded were three edge-modified flakes (including PL 1), an end scraper (PL 2), a biface (PL 3),
and an edge-modified cobble (PL 4), along with three tested cobbles (quartzite and rhyolite) and
three cores (orthoquartzite and chert). Tools are described in Table 5.8 and shown in Figure 5.26.
Lithic raw materials are local varieties of chalcedony, chert, orthoquartzite, quartzite, and rhyolite
with lesser amounts of sandstone.

Site Chronology
Artifacts observed across 41RV113 suggest a prehistoric occupation of the site, but the lack of
diagnostic artifacts precludes a more definitive statement. Therefore, it is not possible to assign a
temporal affiliation to the site beyond unknown aboriginal (< A.D. 1800).

Site Interpretation and Summary
The documented artifact assemblage at 41RV113 suggests lithic material procurement, lithic
reduction, and tool manufacture occurred at the site. The current investigation only recorded the
portion of the site intersecting the survey corridor for the proposed project. In this area, no features
were identified and site 41RV113 is 30 percent intact, with impacts from an existing pipeline
corridor and eolian processes. Based on the suite of artifacts and site location on a hill top with
dense cobbles and gravels, 41RV113 is interpreted as an opportunistic lithic raw material
procurement site.
Eligibility Recommendations
Site 41RV113 is a low-density lithic artifact scatter. The site is approximately 41.75 km (25.94
miles) south of the New Mexico-Texas state line on an upland plain along a hill top, about 4.24
km (2.64 miles) from the Pecos River. Site 41RV113 is not associated with any significant event
or person and is therefore not eligible under Criteria A or B. Its construction does not embody the
work of a master and is therefore not eligible under Criterion C. The site retains diminished
integrity of location, setting, and feeling because the landscape and vegetation reflect some
changes from when the site was likely utilized. Site 41RV113 has diminished integrity of
workmanship and materials, and lacks integrity of design because discrete use areas are not
indicated in the site expression. The site lacks integrity of association because the artifact
assemblage cannot be linked to a specific cultural group or time period. No features were identified
at the site and eight shovel tests were negative for subsurface cultural materials. Further
investigation of the portion of the site within the proposed project corridor is not likely to yield
information that will enhance our understanding of prehistoric lifeways in the region. However,
41RV113 was investigated only where it intersects the proposed project corridor and it is possible
that investigation outside the proposed project corridor could change this assessment. Therefore,
41RV113 is recommended not eligible within the proposed project corridor; an overall
recommendation of eligibility is undetermined pending further investigation of the site.
Management Recommendations
The northern portion of 41RV113 is located within the proposed project corridor. No further
management within the proposed project corridor is recommended with regard to the current
undertaking.

regard to the current undertaking
Site Description
Site 41RV114 is a high-density lithic artifact scatter (Figure 5.27–Figure 5.35, see Figure A.1 in
Appendix A). The site extends along a rolling upland plain and ridge overlooking the flat plain
below. Slope is between 3 and 5 degrees with an east-southeasterly aspect. Distant mountain
ranges are faint on the horizons to the west and west-southwest. Only the portion of the site within
the survey corridor was investigated. In this area, 41RV114 measures 352 m (north-south) × 105
m (east-west) (1,155 × 345 feet), but the site likely continues outside the corridor in all directions.
Ground visibility is good, ranging between 70 and 90 percent, partially obscured by creosote bush
and broom snakeweed, with scattered prickly pear and mesquite. Surface deposits appear to be
yellowish brown sand. Within the site corridor, 41RV114 is 50 percent intact with impacts from a
30-m-wide pipeline (98-foot-wide) corridor that overlaps most of the proposed APE, a cleared
transmission corridor, flowlines, and a caliche access road.
The analyzed artifact assemblage at 41RV114 includes lithic debitage, tools, cores, and tested
cobbles. Most of the artifacts were concentrated downslope of the proposed project area; no
diagnostic artifacts were identified. No features were identified and no additional evidence of
subsurface deposits was present. Thirteen shovel tests were placed throughout the site and
excavated to depths between 8 and 50 cmbs; all were negative for subsurface cultural materials.

Features
No features are present at 41RV114.
Materials Identified
The assemblage consists primarily of lithic debitage. All lithic tools, cores, and tested cobbles at
41RV114 were analyzed and recorded, as was a sample of 150 pieces lithic debitage. Analysis of
the debitage indicates that 37 percent (n = 56) is flakes with 50 percent cortex or more, 30 percent
(n = 45) is flakes with less than 50 percent cortex, 6 percent (n = 10) is non-cortical flakes, and 37
pieces are cortical shatter and two pieces are non-cortical shatter (25 percent and 1 percent,
respectively) (Table 5.9). Tools were 23 edge-modified flakes, a scraper (PL 6), a preform (PL 5),
a chopper (PL 9), and 12 bifaces (PL 1–PL 4, PL 7–PL 8, PL 10–PL 16). Tools are described in
Table 5.10 and Table 5.11 and shown in Figure 5.36 through Figure 5.38. Lithic raw materials are
local varieties of chalcedony, chert, orthoquartzite, quartzite, and rhyolite with lesser amounts of
sandstone, limestone, and petrified wood. Eight cores (chert and chalcedony) and 23 tested cobbles
(chalcedony, chert, orthoquartzite, and rhyolite) were also recorded.

Site Chronology
Artifacts observed across 41RV114 suggest a prehistoric occupation of the site, but the lack of
diagnostic artifacts precludes a more definitive statement. Therefore, it is not possible to assign a
temporal affiliation to the site beyond unknown aboriginal (< A.D. 1800).
Site Interpretation and Summary
The documented artifact assemblage at 41RV114 suggests lithic material procurement, lithic

portion of the site intersecting the survey corridor for the proposed project. In this area, no features

and eolian processes. Based on the suite of artifacts and site location in an area with dense cobbles
and gravels, 41RV114 is interpreted as an opportunistic lithic raw material procurement and toolmaking locale.
Eligibility Recommendations
Site 41RV114 is a high-density lithic artifact scatter. The site is approximately 43.39 km (26.96
miles) south of the New Mexico-Texas state line on an upland plain along a hill top, about 5.34
km (3.32 miles) from the Pecos River. Site 41RV114 is not associated with any significant event
or person and is therefore not eligible under Criteria A or B. Its construction does not embody the
work of a master and is therefore not eligible under Criterion C. The site retains diminished
integrity of location, setting, and feeling because the landscape and vegetation reflect some
changes from when the site was likely utilized. Site 41RV114 retains integrity of workmanship
and materials in the high quantity of lithic tools in the assemblage, but lacks integrity of design
because discrete use areas are not indicated in the site expression. The site lacks integrity of
association because the artifact assemblage cannot be linked to a specific cultural group or time
period. No features were identified at the site and 11 shovel tests were negative for subsurface
cultural materials. Further investigation of the portion of the site within the proposed project
corridor is not likely to yield information that will enhance our understanding of prehistoric
lifeways in the region. However, 41RV114 was investigated only where it intersects the proposed
project corridor and it is possible that investigation outside the proposed project corridor could
change this assessment. Therefore, 41RV114 is recommended not eligible within the proposed
project corridor; an overall recommendation of eligibility is undetermined pending further
investigation of the site.
Management Recommendations
The site is within the proposed area of potential effect. No further management within the proposed
project corridor is recommended with regard to the current undertaking.

5.3 ISOLATED FINDS
Twenty-six isolated finds (IFs) were found during the investigation, scattered across the survey
area. The IFs reflect the prehistoric and historic utilization of the project area. IF details are
presented in Table 5.12 and diagnostic/representative IF photographs are shown in Figure 5.39
through Figure 5.46. Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates for these artifacts are
provided in Table A.2 in the confidential Appendix A.

Texas Public Lands in Reeves County, Texas

6 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Enterprise, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the portions
of the proposed Orla Residue Gas Pipeline falling on GLO lands. The pipeline extends from the
Cryo Plant near Orla in Reeves County, through Ward County, to a location approximately 111
km (69 miles) to the south near Coyanosa in Pecos County, Texas. In Reeves County, the proposed
pipeline would span approximately 8.79 km (5.46 miles) of GLO Lands.
SWCA conducted a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey within a 61-m-wide (200-foot-wide)
corridor centered on the approximately 8.79-km-long (5.46-mile-long) proposed pipeline
centerline provided by Enterprise; subsequent shifts in the proposed project alignment added
additional survey space, for a total survey area of 157.87 acres. The proposed impact area for
pipeline construction would only consist of a 30.5-m-wide (100-foot-wide) corridor with a 9-mwide (30-foot-wide) permanent ROW and a 21-m-wide (70-foot-wide) temporary workspace.
Impacts associated with the construction of the pipeline would affect 66.18 acres within the 30.5m (100-foot) corridor. Field investigations for the current project took place on February 16–18,
February 21, February 28–March 2, and April 11, 2017. Overall, SWCA archaeologists examined
157.87 acres and excavated a total of 39 shovel tests along the proposed pipeline alignment; no
shovel tests were positive for cultural material.
SWCA identified four previously undocumented cultural resource sites (41RV111–41RV114)
during the course of the survey, all of which are aboriginal lithic scatters. Based on a lack of
cultural features and subsurface components, it is the opinion of SWCA that sites 41RV112,
41RV113, and 41RV114 are ineligible for designation as SALs or for inclusion on the NRHP, as
they cannot provide new or important data concerning regional prehistory. As such, SWCA
recommends no further work at these three sites. Feature 1, located on Private land within
41RV111, has intact dateable deposits; however the remaining surveyed portion of the site is heavily
disturbed and lacks subsurface deposits. While 41RV111 is recommended eligible for the NRHP
under Criterion D and the feature should be avoided, the remainder of the site is considered noncontributing to eligibility.
In accordance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA, SWCA has made a reasonable and
good faith effort to identify cultural resources within the investigated project area. Based on the
survey findings, the project will have no adverse effect on cultural resources that warrant SAL
designation or are listed on, or meet the criteria to be listed on, the NRHP provided that Feature 1
at 41RV111 is avoided. If Feature 1 at 41RV111 is avoided, then SWCA recommends that no
further archaeological investigations within the project area are warranted and the project should
be allowed to proceed as planned.

ABSTRACT
Project Title. Addendum Report for the Proposed Orla Residue Gas Pipeline on Texas Public
Lands in Reeves County, Texas
SWCA Project Number. 40216
Project Description. Between late January and early April, 2017, SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of portions of the proposed
Orla Residue Gas Pipeline. The pipeline extends from the Cryo Plant near Orla in Reeves County,
through Ward County, to a location approximately 111 km (69 miles) to the south near Coyanosa
in Pecos County, Texas. In total, 157.87 acres were surveyed on GLO lands in Texas; four sites
and 26 isolated finds were recorded.
Following the initial cultural resources survey and prior to construction of the proposed project,
another pipeline was installed within the same right-of-way (ROW) on one parcel of land in Reeves
County managed by the Texas General Land Office (referred to as GLO Lands). The proposed
ROW for the Orla Residue Gas Pipeline was shifted to the east through this area and SWCA
returned in July 2017 to survey the proposed reroute for cultural resources. The reroute is 1.84 km
(1.14 miles) in length. Two sites (41RV121 and 41RV122) were identified in the survey area for
the proposed reroute. In addition to these two new resources, the previously defined site boundary
for 41RV114 (Sisneros 2017) was modified.
Location. One parcel of GLO Land in Reeves County, Texas.
Number of Acres Surveyed. In total, an additional 27.43 acres were surveyed for cultural
resources within the state of Texas on GLO Lands.
Principal Investigator. Cherie K. Walth
Dates of Work. July 27–28, 2017
Purpose of Work. Enterprise Texas Pipeline LLC, is proposing to construct a residue gas line
from the Cryo Plant near Orla in Reeves County to the Waha Hub in Pecos County.
Properties Identified. One previously recorded site (41RV114), two newly recorded sites
(41RV121 and 41RV122), and eight isolated finds (IFs) were identified during the course of the
survey of the proposed reroute.
Eligibility of Properties. SWCA identified one previously recorded site (41RV114) and two
newly recorded sites (41RV121 and 41RV122) during the course of the survey of the proposed
reroute, all of which are aboriginal lithic scatters. Based on a lack of cultural features and
subsurface cultural deposits, it is SWCA’s opinion that sites 41RV114, 41RV121, and 41RV122
are ineligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as they would not provide new or important data
concerning regional prehistory. As such, SWCA recommends no further work at these three sites.

Curation. No artifacts were collected; curation of associated documentation associated with the
fieldwork will be completed.
Comments. In accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural
resources within the investigated project area. Based on the survey findings, the project will have
no adverse effect on cultural resources that warrant SAL designation or are listed on, or meet the
criteria to be listed on, the NRHP. SWCA recommends no further archaeological investigations
within the project area and the project should be allowed to proceed as planned.

Addendum Report for the Proposed Orla Residue Gas Pipeline on Texas Public Lands in Reeves County, Texas

1 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
On behalf of Enterprise Texas Pipeline LLC (Enterprise), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of components of the proposed Orla
Residue Gas Pipeline in Pecos, Ward, and Reeves Counties, Texas, which includes approximately
111 kilometers (km) (69 miles) of pipeline and appurtenant facilities. In Reeves County, the
proposed pipeline would span approximately 8.79 km (5.46 miles) of lands managed by the Texas
General Land Office (referred to as GLO Lands) (Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2, see Appendix A).
Between late January and early April, 2017, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of portions of the proposed Orla Residue Gas
Pipeline. The pipeline extends from the Cryo Plant near Orla in Reeves County, through Ward
County, to a location approximately 111 km (69 miles) to the south near Coyanosa in Pecos
County, Texas. In total, 157.87 acres were surveyed on GLO Lands in Texas; four sites and 26
isolated finds were recorded.
Following the initial cultural resources survey and prior to construction of the proposed project,
another pipeline was installed within the same right-of-way (ROW) on one parcel of land in Reeves
County managed by the Texas General Land Office. The proposed ROW for the Orla Residue Gas
Pipeline was shifted to the east through this area and SWCA returned in July 2017 to survey the
proposed reroute for cultural resources. SWCA conducted a 100 percent intensive pedestrian
survey within the area of potential effects (APE) on GLO Lands of approximately 1.84 km (1.14
miles). Impacts associated with the construction of the pipeline would occur within a 30.5-m-wide
(100-foot-wide) pipeline construction corridor (66.18 acres), 9 m (30 feet) of which will be the
permanent ROW and 21 m (70 feet) of which will be temporary ROW. A 50-foot survey buffer
was added to the 100-foot corridor for a total survey corridor width of 200 feet.
SWCA archaeologists Courtney Blair, Thea Stehlik-Barry, and John Stuurmans completed the
field investigations for the current project on July 27 and 28, 2017. The purpose of the work was
to locate and identify cultural resources within the APE, establish vertical and horizontal site
boundaries as appropriate with regard to the project area, and evaluate the significance and
eligibility of any site recorded within the property for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL) or for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All investigations were
conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) standards, with any
exceptions thoroughly documented. Photographs of the current project area (reroute area) are
provided in Figure 1.3 through Figure 1.5. Two sites (41RV121 and 41RV122) were identified in
the survey area for the proposed reroute. In addition to these two new resources, the previously
defined site boundary for 41RV114 (Sisneros 2017) was modified (Figure 1.2).

2 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area within GLO Lands is in northeastern Reeves County (see Figure 1.1 and Figure
1.2). The Pecos River is 10.8 km (6.7 miles) northeast of the eastern extent of the project area.
Rustler Hills is 23.1 km (14.3 miles) to the southwest, and Owl Hills is approximately 26.9 km
(16.7 miles) northwest of the survey corridor. Please refer to Sisneros (2017) for a thorough
discussion of the environmental setting.
The primary disturbances within the portion of the project area on GLO Lands include the previous
construction of existing oil and gas field infrastructure (e.g., well pads, access roads, and
pipelines). Other disturbances include previous grading and clearing, utilities (subsurface), and
wind erosion/scouring.

3 CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND SETTING
Please refer to Sisneros (2017) for a thorough discussion of the prehistoric and historic chronology
of the project area.

4 RESEARCH DESIGN
4.1 BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA conducted a thorough cultural resources background review and literature search of the
project area and surrounding 3.2-km-wide (2-mile-wide) study area (1.6 km [1 mile] on either side
of the pipeline centerline). SWCA archaeologist Brianne Sisneros examined relevant portions of
the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Texas Historical Commission 2015). This source
provided information on the nature and location of previously conducted archaeological surveys
and the location of previously recorded cultural resources, including NRHP districts and
properties, sites designated as SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers, Recorded Texas Historic
Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys. As a part of the review, Ms. Sisneros
reviewed the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay, a
mapping/geographic information system (GIS) database with historical maps and resource
information covering most portions of the state (Foster et al. 2006). Aerial photographs were also
reviewed to assist in identifying any potential cultural resources and disturbances.

4.2 FIELD METHODS
The general survey consisted of a crew of two archaeologists walking the 61-m-wide (200-footwide) study area, examining the ground surface, documenting modifications and disturbances, and
using shovel tests and erosional exposures to assess the potential for subsurface archaeological
deposits, as well as assessing the geomorphic setting of the area. Shovel tests were excavated in
areas that 1) did not show signs of extensive prior disturbance, 2) consisted of soils believed to
have a potential for buried deposits close enough to the surface to be detected through this method
of subsurface investigation, and 3) where ground surface visibility was less than 30 percent.
In total, 23 shovel tests were excavated in support of the rerouted project area. Prior to conducting
fieldwork, Natural Resources Conservation Service (2017) soil surveys within the project area and
geologic maps were consulted in order to assess the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits.
THC archaeological standards specify that a minimum of 16 shovel tests are required per mile
within a survey corridor of 30.5 m (100 feet) unless surface visibility is greater than 30 percent.
The SWCA survey placed 18 shovel tests across three sites and an additional five tests in areas of
low visibility. Shovel tests were excavated 5 to 30 centimeters (cm) below the ground surface
(cmbs) and were terminated when pre-Holocene subsoils (caliche layers) were reached. Shovel
tests were typically not performed when the surface visibility was greater than 30 percent.
Locations and results of the shovel tests are included in Appendix A. All shovel tests were negative
for subsurface artifacts or features.
Field conditions, such as exposed bedrock, deflated areas, and existing disturbances, ultimately
determined where shovel testing was warranted. Each shovel test measured roughly 30 × 30 cm in
size and was excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth unless soil characteristics or
bedrock precluded reaching that depth. The matrix from each shovel test was screened through
¼-inch mesh, and the location of each excavation was plotted using a handheld, sub-meter accurate
Trimble global positioning system (GPS) receiver.

Because this was a non-collection survey, any artifacts discovered were tabulated, analyzed, and
documented in the field, but not collected. Temporally diagnostic artifacts, if present, were to be
described in detail and photographed in the field.

5 RESULTS
5.1 BACKGROUND REVIEW RESULTS
Prior to SWCA’s original investigation of the project area (see Sisneros 2017), a background
review determined that no cultural resource sites were known within the area, but that three
archaeological sites (41RV87, 41RV88, and 41RV92) were mapped within a 1.6-km (1-mile)
radius (Table 5.1). As reported in Sisneros (2017), SWCA’s original survey of the area
documented four prehistoric sites (Table 5.2). One of these sites, 41RV114, is within the survey
area of the present investigation for the proposed reroute.

A). Field investigations for the current project took place on July 27 and 28, 2017. Survey efforts
were augmented with shovel testing and inspection of any available erosional profiles. In total, 18
shovel tests were excavated throughout the archaeological sites and five shovel tests were added
in areas where ground visibility was less than 30 percent (see Appendix A).
The intensive cultural resources investigations examined a total of 27.43 acres. In total, the survey
of the proposed pipeline alignment resulted in the documentation of 41RV114, first recorded as
part of the original investigation for this project (Sisneros 2017), and two newly recorded cultural
resource sites (41RV121 and 41RV122). Eight isolated finds (IFs) were also identified and
recorded.

Site Description
Site 41RV114 is a high-density lithic artifact scatter first documented during the initial field survey
for the proposed project (Sisneros 2017). At the time, only the portion of the site within the survey
corridor was investigated; the area measured 352 m (north-south) × 105 m (east-west) (1,155 ×
345 feet), but the site is likely to extend outside the corridor in all directions (Figure 5.1–Figure
5.3, see Figure A.1 in Appendix A). In this area, 41RV114 had been impacted by a 30-m-wide
(98-foot-wide) pipeline corridor overlapping most of the proposed APE, a cleared transmission
corridor, flowlines, and a caliche access road. The analyzed artifact assemblage at 41RV114
included lithic debitage, tools, cores, and tested cobbles. No features were identified and no
additional evidence of subsurface deposits was present. Thirteen shovel tests were placed
throughout the site during the original investigation and were excavated to depths between 8 and
50 cmbs; all were negative for subsurface cultural materials.
Following the initial cultural resource survey and prior to construction of the proposed project,
another pipeline was installed within the proposed ROW. The proposed ROW for the Orla Residue
Gas Pipeline was shifted to the east and SWCA returned in July 2017 to survey the proposed
reroute for cultural resources. Site 41RV114 was found to extend north and east of its previously
recorded boundary and the site records were updated to reflect the surface expression of the site

within the newly proposed ROW. The redefined site boundary now measures approximately 387.7
× 151.1 m (1,272 × 496 feet). Seven shovel tests were excavated to depths between 5 and 30 cmbs
and contained no subsurface cultural materials.

Features
No features are present at 41RV114.
Materials Identified
This section synthesizes the assemblage data gathered over both visits to site 41RV114. The
assemblage is primarily lithic debitage. Lithic raw materials are local varieties of chalcedony,
chert, orthoquartzite, quartzite, and rhyolite with lesser amounts of sandstone, limestone, and
petrified wood. All lithic tools, cores, and tested cobbles at 41RV114 were analyzed and recorded,
as was a sample of 152 pieces of lithic debitage. Analysis of the debitage indicates that 37 percent
(n = 56) is flakes with 50 percent cortex or more, 30 percent (n = 45) is flakes with less than 50
percent cortex, 6 percent (n = 10) is non-cortical flakes, and 37 pieces are cortical shatter and two
pieces are non-cortical shatter (25 percent and 1 percent, respectively) (Table 5.3). Tools were 27
edge-modified flakes (Table 5.4), a scraper (PL 6), a preform (PL 5), a chopper (PL 9), and 12
bifaces (PL 1–PL 4, PL 7, PL 8, PL 10–PL 16). Tools are described in Table 5.4 and Table 5.5.
Please refer to Sisneros (2017) for photographs of PLs 1–16. Eight cores (chert and chalcedony)
and 23 tested cobbles (chalcedony, chert, orthoquartzite, and rhyolite) were also recorded.

Site Chronology
Artifacts observed across 41RV114 suggest a prehistoric occupation of the site, but the lack of
diagnostic artifacts precludes a more definitive statement. Therefore, it is not possible to assign a
temporal affiliation to the site beyond unknown aboriginal (< A.D. 1800).
Site Interpretation and Summary
The documented artifact assemblage at 41RV114 suggests lithic material procurement, lithic
reduction, and tool manufacture occurred at the site. The current investigation only recorded the

portion of the site intersecting the survey corridor for the proposed reroute project. In this area, no
features were identified and 41RV114 is 50 percent intact, with impacts from an existing pipeline
corridor and eolian processes. Based on the suite of artifacts and site location in an area with dense
cobbles and gravels, 41RV114 is interpreted as an opportunistic lithic raw-material procurement
and tool-making locale.
Eligibility Recommendations
Site 41RV114 is a high-density lithic artifact scatter. The site is approximately 43.4 km (26.9
miles) south of the New Mexico-Texas state line on an upland plain along a hilltop, about 5.3 km
(3.3 miles) from the Pecos River. Site 41RV114 is not associated with any significant event or
person and is therefore not eligible under Criterion A or B. Its construction does not embody the
work of a master and is therefore not eligible under Criterion C. No features were identified at the
site and 20 shovel tests were negative for subsurface cultural materials. Further investigation of
the portion of the site within the proposed project corridor is not likely to yield information that
will enhance our understanding of prehistoric lifeways in the region. However, 41RV114 was
investigated only where it intersects the proposed project corridor and it is possible that
investigation outside the proposed project corridor could change this assessment. Therefore,
41RV114 within the proposed project corridor is recommended not eligible to the NRHP; an
overall recommendation of NRHP eligibility is undetermined pending further investigation of the
site.
Management Recommendations
The site is within the proposed area of potential effect. No further management within the proposed
project corridor is recommended with regard to the current undertaking.

Site Description
Site 41RV121 is a lithic procurement site and artifact scatter southwest of the Pecos River (Figure
5.5–Figure 5.9, see Figure A.1 in Appendix A). The site was identified on a gravel sheet along an
upland plain within a larger undulating landscape. The southern part of the site is on a gravel rise
and large ridges are nearby to the east. Only the portion of 41RV121 within the survey corridor

was investigated, but the site extends outside the corridor to the east for an unknown distance. Site
41RV121 measures 124.8 m (north-south) × 49.1 m (east-west) (409 × 161 feet) within the survey
corridor. Ground visibility is good, around 80 percent during the site visit, partially limited by
creosote bush and bunch grasses, with lesser amounts of snakeweed and forbs. Surface deposits
are a dull brown sand. The site is 75 percent intact within the survey corridor with eolian processes
that are shifting top soil sediments and re-depositing windblown sands, some alluvial erosion in
the form of ephemeral washes across the site, and minor bioturbation. Two lightly-traveled twotrack roads cross the site north-south.
The analyzed artifact assemblage at 41RV121 consists of a 90 percent representative sample of
lithic debitage, three edge-modified flakes, one lithic tool, 14 tested cobbles, and one core. No
diagnostic artifacts were identified. No features were identified and no additional evidence of
subsurface deposits was present. Seven shovel tests were placed throughout the site and excavated
to depths between 11 and 25 cmbs; all were negative for subsurface cultural materials.

Features
No features are present at 41RV121.
Materials Identified
The assemblage is primarily lithic debitage. Lithic raw materials are local varieties of chalcedony,
chert, orthoquartzite, quartzite, and rhyolite. All lithic tools, cores, and tested cobbles at 41RV121
were analyzed and recorded, as was a sample of 100 pieces lithic debitage, representing
approximately 90 percent of the total surface assemblage. Analysis of the debitage indicates that
86 percent (n = 86) is flakes with 50 percent cortex or more, 13 percent (n = 13) is flakes with less
than 50 percent cortex, and one piece is shatter (1 percent) (Table 5.6). Tools were three edgemodified flakes and a flake tool (PL 1). PL 1 is a thermally altered gray chert flake with bilateral
flaking on proximal edge, with less than 50 percent cortex and measuring 4.3 × 3.5 × 0.8 cm
(Figure 5.10). The artifact is possibly a drill or burin. One unidirectional chalcedony core and 14
tested cobbles (chalcedony, chert, orthoquartzite, rhyolite, and sandstone) were also recorded.

Site Chronology
Artifacts observed across 41RV121 suggest a prehistoric occupation of the site, but the lack of
diagnostic artifacts precludes a more definitive statement. Therefore, it is not possible to assign a
temporal or cultural affiliation to the site beyond unknown aboriginal (< A.D. 1800).
Site Interpretation and Summary
The documented artifact assemblage at 41RV121 suggests lithic material procurement, early stage
lithic reduction, and some tool manufacture occurred at the site. The current investigation only
recorded the portion of the site intersecting the survey corridor for the proposed project. In this
area, no features were identified and 41RV121 is 75 percent intact, with primary impacts from
alluvial and eolian processes. Based on the suite of artifacts and site location in an area with dense
cobbles and gravels, 41RV121 is interpreted as an opportunistic lithic raw material procurement
and tool-making site.
Eligibility Recommendations
Site 41RV121 is a lithic artifact scatter of moderate density. The site is approximately 42.2 km
(26.2 miles) south of the New Mexico-Texas state line on an upland plain, approximately 4.5 km
(2.8 miles) from the Pecos River. Site 41RV121 is not associated with any significant event or
person and is therefore not eligible under Criteria A or B. Its construction does not embody the
work of a master and is therefore not eligible under Criterion C. The artifact assemblage cannot be
linked to a specific cultural group or time period. No features were identified at the site and seven
shovel tests were negative for subsurface cultural materials. Further investigation of the portion of
the site within the proposed project corridor is not likely to yield information that will enhance our
understanding of prehistoric lifeways in the region. However, 41RV121 was investigated only
where it intersects the proposed project corridor and it is possible that investigation outside the
proposed project corridor could change this assessment. Therefore, 41RV121 is recommended not
eligible within the proposed project corridor; an overall recommendation of eligibility is
undetermined pending further investigation.
Management Recommendations
The site is within the proposed area of potential effect. No further management within the proposed
project corridor is recommended with regard to the current undertaking.

Site Description
Site 41RV122 is an artifact scatter on a gravel rise around 3.1 miles southwest of the Pecos River
(Figure 5.11–Figure 5.14, see Figure A.1 in Appendix A). The rise slopes from less than 1 up to 3
degrees with westerly, northerly, and easterly aspects. Surface gravels are between 20 and 30
percent. Site 41RV122 measures 61.9 m (north-south) × 47.4 m (east-west) (203 × 155 feet) and
is completely located within the survey corridor. Ground visibility is very good, around 80 percent
during the site visit, with some views partially limited by creosote bush, grasses, and forbs. Surface
deposits are a dull brown sand 7.5YR 5/4 (dry). The site is around 75 percent intact. The most
significant impacts to overall site integrity are from eolian processes deflating top soil sediments
and re-depositing windblown sands. The existing pipeline corridor is 15 m to the west.
No features were identified and there is no additional evidence of subsurface archaeological
deposits. All observed artifacts at 41RV122 were analyzed and recorded. The non-diagnostic
assemblage is lithic debitage, an edge-modified flake, a core, and six tested cobbles. Four shovel
tests were placed throughout the site and excavated to depths between 12 and 16 cmbs; all
terminated at bedrock and were negative for subsurface cultural materials.

Features
No features are present at 41RV122.
Materials Identified
All 28 artifacts observed at the site were analyzed and recorded. The assemblage is indicative of
lithic reduction and expedient tool manufacture. Artifacts consist of 20 pieces of lithic debitage
(Table 5.7), an edge-modified chert flake, six tested cobbles (chert and chalcedony), and a chert
core. Raw materials are all locally available varieties of chalcedony, chert, orthoquartzite, and
quartzite. The debitage is dominated by flakes with 50 percent cortex or more (n = 14), followed
by shatter (n = 4), and flakes with less than 50 percent cortex (n = 2).

Site Chronology
Artifacts observed across 41RV122 suggest a prehistoric occupation of the site, but the lack of
diagnostic artifacts precludes a more definitive statement. The site is assigned a temporal affiliation
of unknown aboriginal (< A.D. 1800).
Site Interpretation and Summary
The artifact assemblage at 41RV122 suggests that some lithic material procurement, lithic
reduction, and expedient tool manufacture occurred at the site. No features were identified. The
site is around 75 percent intact. The most significant impacts to overall site integrity are deflation
and deposition from eolian processes. Based on the site location, small assemblage, and similarity
with other nearby sites in an area with dense cobbles and gravels, 41RV122 is interpreted as an
opportunistic lithic raw material procurement and tool-making locale.
Eligibility Recommendations
Site 41RV122 is a low density lithic artifact scatter of indeterminate temporal and cultural
affiliation. The site is approximately 43.1 km (26.8 miles) south of the New Mexico-Texas state
line on an upland plain, approximately 5.3 km (3.2 miles) from the Pecos River. Site 41RV122 is
not associated with any significant event or person and is therefore not eligible under Criteria A or
B. Its construction does not embody the work of a master and is therefore not eligible under
Criterion C. No features were identified at the site and four shovel tests were negative for
subsurface cultural materials. The artifact assemblage cannot be linked to a specific cultural group
or time period. Further investigation of the portion of the site within the proposed project corridor

is not likely to yield information that will enhance our understanding of prehistoric lifeways in the
region. Therefore, 41RV122 is recommended not eligible under Criterion D.
Management Recommendations
The site is within the proposed APE. No further management within the proposed project corridor
is recommended with regard to the current undertaking.

5.2.2 ISOLATED FINDS
Eight IFs were found during the investigation, scattered across the survey area. The IFs reflect the

6 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Enterprise, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for a proposed
reroute of the Orla Residue Gas Pipeline alignment falling on GLO Lands. The pipeline extends
from the Cryo Plant near Orla in Reeves County, through Ward County, to a location
approximately 111 km (69 miles) to the south near Coyanosa in Pecos County, Texas.
SWCA conducted a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey within a 61-m-wide (200-foot-wide)
corridor identified by Enterprise as a potential area for rerouting the pipeline. The proposed impact
area for pipeline construction would only consist of a 30.5-m-wide (100-foot-wide) corridor with
a 9-m-wide (30-foot-wide) permanent ROW and a 21-m-wide (70-foot-wide) temporary
workspace. Field investigations for the current project took place on July 27 and 28, 2017. Overall,
SWCA archaeologists examined 27.43 acres and excavated a total of 23 shovel tests along the
proposed pipeline alignment; no shovel tests were positive for cultural material.
SWCA identified one previously recorded cultural resource site (41RV114) and two previously
undocumented cultural resource sites (41RV121 and 41RV122) during the course of the survey,
all of which are aboriginal lithic scatters. Based on a lack of cultural features and subsurface
cultural deposits, it is SWCA’s opinion that sites 41RV121 and 41RV122 are ineligible for
designation as SALs or for inclusion on the NRHP, as they cannot provide new or important data
concerning regional prehistory. Sites 41RV114 and 41RV121 were found to extend into the
potential reroute corridor. A total of 20 shovel tests were excavated through 41RV114 and 7 shovel
tests were excavated through 41RV121; all were negative for cultural materials. However, because
the sites were recorded only where it intersects the proposed project corridor, it is possible that
investigation outside the proposed project corridor could change this assessment. Therefore,
41RV114 and 41RV121 are recommended not eligible within the proposed project corridor; an
overall recommendation of eligibility is undetermined pending further investigation of the sites.
As such, SWCA recommends no further work at these three sites in regard to the proposed
undertaking.
In accordance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA, SWCA has made a reasonable and
good-faith effort to identify cultural resources within the investigated project area. Based on the
survey findings, the project will have no adverse effect on cultural resources that warrant SAL
designation or are listed on, or meet the criteria to be listed on, the NRHP. SWCA recommends
no further archaeological investigations within the project area and the project should be allowed
to proceed as planned.
