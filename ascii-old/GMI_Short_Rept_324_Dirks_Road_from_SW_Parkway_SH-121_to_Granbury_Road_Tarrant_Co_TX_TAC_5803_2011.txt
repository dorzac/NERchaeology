MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by Geo-Marine,
Inc., under subcontract to Civil Associates, Inc., for the city of Fort Worth. The proposed project
consists of widening an approximately 1,800-foot-long portion of Dirks Road from the Southwest
Parkway (State Highway 121) corridor to Granbury Road in southwestern Tarrant County, Texas
(CSJ 0902-48-775). The project would expand Dirks Road, currently a two-lane undivided paved
road, to a six-lane divided roadway. As the proposed project will involve funds from the Federal
Highway Administration and the City of Fort Worth, these investigations were conducted in
accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5803.
Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 9 November 2010 and 5 January 2011. The historic
standing structures survey conducted for this undertaking are reported in a separate document
(McDougall 2011). Much of the project area has been subjected to ground-disturbing activities
associated with recent commercial development and the construction and maintenance of Dirks
Road and other local roadways. No cultural resources were encountered during this survey. It is
therefore recommended that the proposed expansion of Dirks Road be allowed to proceed. No
artifacts were collected during this archeological survey. All other materials generated by this
project will be permanently curated with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by Geo-Marine,
Inc. (project #30561.01.06), under subcontract to Civil Associates, Inc., for the city of Fort
Worth. The proposed project consists of widening a portion of Dirks Road that is approximately
1,800 feet (ft; 549-meter [m]) long from the Southwest Parkway (State Highway [SH] 121)
corridor to Granbury Road in southwestern Tarrant County, Texas (CSJ 0902-48-775). Located
near the southwestern city limits of Fort Worth, the project area is approximately 5 kilometers
(km; 3.1 miles [mi]) southeast of the city of Benbrook (Figure 1). The proposed project would
expand Dirks Road, currently a two-lane undivided paved road, to a six-lane divided roadway
(Appendix A). The current 50-ft-wide (15-m) right-of-way (ROW) will be expanded to 130 ft
(40 m) along the roadway and 169 ft (52 m) at intersections. The railroad overpass and
approaches that currently exist along Dirks Road will be reconstructed. In addition, an unnamed
tributary stream that intercepts Dirks Road within the project area will be channelized, graded,
and routed under the proposed roadway via a culvert. Most of the construction will occur within
the uppermost 3 ft (0.9 m) of depth, except at the unnamed stream where construction depth
would be approximately 6 ft (1.8). The area of potential effects (APE) for the project consists of
2.7 acres of ROW and an additional 2.6 acres for easements. The proposed project will involve
funds from the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Fort Worth. Thus, these
investigations were conducted in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act and the
Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5803.
The purpose of these investigations was to determine the presence/absence of archeological
resources (as defined by 36 CFR 800.4) and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility
for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CRF
800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or as designated State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs) under the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12). The
archeological fieldwork conducted for this project conforms to the guidelines set forth in the
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas proposed by the Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) and adopted by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). This investigation consisted of a
background literature and site records review, an assessment of archival sources, a systematic
pedestrian reconnaissance of the project area, and the excavation and documentation of shovel
tests in the project area. Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 9 November 2010 and 5
January 2011 by Geo-Marine Project Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster. A total of 7 personhours were spent conducting fieldwork. Melissa Green served as the project Principal
Investigator throughout the process of this investigation. Although no artifacts were collected
during this investigation, all other materials generated by this project will be permanently curated
with the Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL) in Austin at the conclusion of the project.
The following sections of this report provide a review of the environmental setting and cultural
context of the region, and summarize the methods, results, and recommendations of this cultural
resources survey. Following the main body of the report is a complete list of all references cited.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The proposed project area is located within the gently rolling uplands of the Grand Prairie, an
ecological subdivision of the Blackland Prairie situated between the Eastern and Western Cross
Timbers in southwestern Tarrant County, Texas (Griffith et al. 2004). This region is located
within the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950), which supports a variety of flora and fauna. The
project area occupies an elevation range of 228â245 m (748â804 ft) above mean sea level (amsl)
with slopes of 0â3 percent (Figure 2). The soils in this region are predominantly clay-rich
vertisols derived from the in situ weathering of the underlying Early Cretaceous-age chalky
limestones and marls of the Fort Worth Limestone and Duck Creek formations (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1987; Hill 1901:257â260). The project area is situated across the Slidell and
Aledo soil series and the Sanger-Urban Land and Bolar-Urban Land soil complexes (Table 1; see
Figure 2). Information regarding the soils of the project area has been synthesized and
summarized from data supplied by the Soil Conservation Service (Ressel 1981) and the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (2010). An unnamed tributary of the Clear Fork Trinity River
bisects the project area, flowing to the northwest approximately 3.5 linear km (2.2 mi).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Prikryl (1987, 1990) established a generalized prehistoric chronological framework of six periods
for the upper Trinity River basin. Investigations at Lewisville Lake in Denton County (Lebo and
Brown 1990) and Joe Pool Lake in Dallas County (Peter and McGregor 1988) refined this
framework to a four-period model. The overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at
both lakes, however, remains to be demonstrated. The generalized chronology presented here
(Table 2) reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from both sets of investigations
but is based primarily on the model provided by Peter and McGregor (1988). Lebo and Brown
(1990; Brown and Lebo 1991) present a chronology keyed specifically for Lewisville Lake, but it
closely follows the chronology proposed for Joe Pool Lake. Detailed synopses of the chronology
of the area can be found elsewhere and will therefore not be discussed in this report.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to fieldwork, review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by the THC
indicated that one cultural resources survey has been conducted within 1 km (0.6 mi) of the
proposed project area. That survey, conducted in 1994 by TxDOT along the proposed Southwest
Parkway (SH 121) corridor between Interstate Highway 20 and U.S. Highway 67, examined
approximately 38.6 km (24 mi) of proposed highway corridor, a portion of which is immediately
to the west of the proposed project area (TxDOT 1994). No cultural resources have been
documented within 1 km (0.6 mi) of the proposed project area.

METHODS
ARCHIVAL METHODS
Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era structural cultural resources existing within the proposed project area. These
materials include historic highway maps, topographic maps, and soil surveys (which often record
cultural resources such as cemeteries, houses, and related features) and aerial photography. With
the exception of the Fort Worth and Western Railroad (FWWR), which has occupied its current
ROW since the late nineteenth century, historic period land use of the project area appears to
have been confined to agricultural operations. Based on a review of the 1920 Tarrant County
soils map and 1952 United States Geological Survey (USGS) aerial photographs, the area
immediately surrounding the project area consisted of pastureland during the early to midtwentieth century. A primary structure is indicated to the northwest of the intersection of Dirks
Road and Granbury Road on the 1955 USGS 7.5-minute (1:24,000-scale) Benbrook topographic
quadrangle.
Additionally, aerial photography and low-altitude satellite imagery recorded during the last 15
years was reviewed to determine the rate and degree of recent urban and suburban development
within the project area. These sources indicate that much of the project area has been subjected to
extensive ground-disturbing activities. In early 2002, fill material was deposited across the
property west of the railroad corridor and to the north of Dirks Road. In 2004, the portion of the
project area east of the railroad corridor and north of Dirks Road was extensively impacted during
the construction of the All Store storage facility. During 2007, the property south of Dirks Road
and east of the railroad corridor appears to have been cleared and at least partially leveled.
Finally, the portion of the project area south of Dirks Road and west of the FWWR corridor has
been heavily disturbed within the last year as a staging area for construction activities. Based on
this review, little, if any, of the project area is likely to preserve intact archeological deposits.

SURVEY METHODS
The proposed project area was intensively investigated to determine the presence of cultural
resources using a combined technique of systematic visual reconnaissance and the excavation of
screened shovel tests. Each shovel test was approximately 35 centimeters (cm; 14 inches [in]) in
diameter and excavated in approximately 20-cm (8-in) arbitrary levels to 80 cm (32 in) below
surface (bs), or until subsoil was encountered. The excavated soil from each shovel test was
passed through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) mesh screen to facilitate the recovery of artifacts. The
location of each shovel test was recorded with a submeter-accurate TrimbleÂ® GeoXTâ¢ global
positioning system (GPS) unit, and the soil profile exposed in each of the shovel tests was
documented on standardized forms. All areas not intensively investigated due to prior
disturbance were documented. Digital photographs were used to document the survey conditions,
disturbances, and any cultural features observed. All data generated from this project will be
permanently housed at TARL in Austin at the conclusion of the project.

RESULTS
The entire project area is located in a generally level to gently rolling upland setting that is
rapidly transitioning from a rural landscape to a residential and commercial suburban landscape.
The majority of development within the project area has occurred over the last decade in response
to the rapid growth rate of Fort Worth and adjacent communities. The APE consists of 2.7 acres
of ROW and an additional 2.6 acres for easements. Twelve shovel tests were excavated and one
stream bank profile was examined in an attempt to locate buried cultural resources within the
project area (Figure 3). All excavations were conducted within the APE.
The majority of shovel tests excavated within the project area encountered either disturbed fill or
exhibited truncated soil profiles (Table 3). Shovel Tests (STs) 1 and 2 encountered a mantle of
fill associated with the 2002 modifications to the property. Along the channelized unnamed
drainage, ST 3 encountered what may be an undisturbed soil profile although ST 4 encountered
disturbances likely related to the channelization of the drainage or the deposition of fill. Along
the northern ROW to the east of the railroad corridor, STs 5â7 and a visual inspection of the
intersection of Dirks Road and Granbury Road revealed that the area has been extensively
disturbed by the construction of the All Store storage facility, buried utilities, and the construction
and maintenance of Dirks Road (Figure 4), as evidenced by the presence of construction fill and
truncated soil profiles. Shovel Test 8, excavated within the southern ROW east of the railroad
corridor (Figure 5), appeared to be disturbed by clearing or land leveling that took place on the
property in 2007. Shovel Test 9, excavated adjacent to the construction staging area south of
Dirks Road and west of the railroad corridor (Figure 6), appeared to represent an undisturbed
portion of the project area. The unnamed drainage that bisects the project area in the vicinity of
the railroad bridge has been heavily impacted by development of the surrounding area. The
drainage has been largely eradicated south of Dirks Road, existing only in a confined area
adjacent to the railroad bridge (Figure 7). The unnamed drainage has been channelized north of
Dirks Road but appears to be more intact in that area (Figure 8). This drainage will be rechannelized to flow parallel to the FWWR ROW (see Appendix A). No artifacts or cultural
features were encountered within the shovel tests or in the exposure of the unnamed drainage.

RECOMMENDATIONS
This reconnaissance and intensive archeological survey with shovel testing conducted along
Dirks Road from the Southwest Parkway (SH 121) corridor to Granbury Road (CSJ 0902-48-775)
did not encounter any cultural materials. Soil profiles within the project area indicate that the
majority of the APE has been significantly disturbed by modern construction activities associated
with rapid suburban growth. No historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC
26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8 were identified during the archeological
investigation of the current project APE. The upland setting and the scarcity of a reliable water
supply indicate that prehistoric archeological remains within the project area are not probable.
The only water supply within the project area is an ephemeral unnamed tributary of the Clear
Fork Trinity River. Any intact deposits that may have been associated with this drainage have
been adversely affected by channelization of the drainage and modern development in the
vicinity. Historic remains (e.g., remains from early farmsteads or tenant houses), although more
likely to be encountered within the region, were not encountered during this survey. If any
archeological resources had been present within the project area, previous impacts from road
construction, buried utility placements, and commercial construction would have severely
compromised the integrity of such resources.

Although no artifacts were collected during this investigation, all other materials generated by
this project will be permanently curated with TARL at the conclusion of the project. Based on
the results of this survey, there is low to no potential for deposits containing archeological
materials within the current or proposed ROW. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13
TAC 26.2, it is recommended that no further investigation is necessary. Consequently, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that
evidence of archeological deposits are encountered during construction, work in the immediate
area shall immediately cease. TxDOT archeological staff shall be contacted in order to initiate
accidental discovery procedures under the provisions of the Programmatic Agreement among
TxDOT, Texas Historical Commission, Federal Highway Administration, and Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation; and the Memorandum of Understanding between TxDOT and THC.
