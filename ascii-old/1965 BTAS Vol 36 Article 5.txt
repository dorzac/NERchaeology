Five Crania from the Jamaica Beach Site
(41 GV 5), Galveston County, Texas
L. E. ATEN

ABSTRACT
Anthropometric and morphologic data are presented on three complete and two
fragmentary skulls excavated from a site on Galveston Island which was occupied
late in time (approximately A.D. 1500 ). The burial complex and skeletal materials
at the site share traits with those of the Addicks Basin and Caplen sites, but the
assessment of any relationship is hazardous at present.

This project was conceived as an effort to salvage anthropometric
data on the five human crania from the Jamaica Beach Site which
were housed at the Houston Museum of Natural Science during the
period of the study, January through August, 1963. They were made
available by Dr. T . E . Pulley, Director of the museum. The remains
studied represent but a few of the total recovered ( 17 burials were unearthed), but they are, relative to those normally found in the Galveston Bay region, in an excellent state of preservation.
The Jamaica Beach Site, on Galveston Island, was excavated by
members of the H ouston Archeological Society for the Houston Museum of Natural Science, which lacked the facilities and personnel for
such an undertaking. All artifacts, skeletal material and general responsibility for the site remain with the museum and the Jamaica
Beach Corporation, the firm which first encountered the burials in the
course of preparing the area for a housing development.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

To summarize the cultural features of the burial area (from the
writer's notes unless indicated otherwise ), 17 flexed burials were excavated from an area approximately 20 feet square. Of these, 14 were
placed on their dorsal (back ) side and two were placed on their ventral
( chest) side, all with the long axis of the body in an alignment ranging from east northeast-west southwest to east southeast-west northwest, with heads in a westerly direction. One burial was placed in almost the opposite orientation: on the dorsal side, aligned on an east
southeast-west northwest axis with the head in an easterly direction.
This burial, although not one of those examined at the museum, was

154

measured for the two principal diameters of the skull vault, maximum
length and breadth, while still in the ground and will be mentioned in
the conclusion of this report. No preferential direction for placing the
face was observed; most of the heads, however, were forced into a vertical plane with respect to the body. According to Ring ( 1963: 4) , most
of the burials were covered with a fairly compact layer of oyster shells.
Burial accessories consisted solely of an arrangement of Dosinia sp.
and Dinocardium sp. shells over a femur of Burial K. Other specimens,
including some lithic pieces and bone artifacts, were recovered from
the cemetery area, but they appeared to be incidental inclusions fmm
nearby midden accumulations.
Radiocarbon analysis of Dosinia sp. shells associated with Burial K
(Sample run by Shell Development Co.; Catalog No. 349-A) produced a date of 490 Â± 100 B. P. (Ring, 1963: 5 ). This date agrees
well with the other radiocarbon dates from the site, and may even be
within the range acceptable for the European items possibly associated
with the nearby Indian occupation. The cultural affiliations have not
yet been fully determined, although the dominant native ceramics are
apparently identifiable as Goose Creek wares. Readers desiring further
information on this site are referred to Ring ( 1963 ).
DESCRIPTION OF THE CRANIA

The procedures for taking measurements and reporting morphological observations followed here are, with slight modification, those
outlined by Hrdlicka ( 1952) but were undertaken without professional supervision. All age determinations were based on the extent of
suture closure of the vault (Cornwall, 1960; Montagu, 1960), and the
state of wear of the teeth (Hrdlicka, 1952: 52--53 ).
Measurements taken are presented in Table 1; indices computed
therefrom are presented in Table 2; measurements of the teeth are
presented in Table 3; and a tabulation of morphological observations
is presented in Table 4.
The descriptions to be presented below represent summaries of some
55 measurements and 33 morphological observations possible on each
skull.
Burial B: A partially restorable skull and lower jaw of a young adult
male, approximately 30 years old. The posterior portion of the frontal
bone and the anterior portion of the parietals are missing, thus making
it impossible to take most of the usual measurements on the vault. No
artificial deformation is evidenced.
The maxilla exhibits a healed fracture of the area anterior to a line

roots of the incisors and canines. Presumably a lesion in the palate
behind the right second incisor and excessive wear of the incisors and
canines relative to the premolars and molars is related to the fracture.
All teeth are erupted and present. Wear is generally third degree

occur. The teeth are all erupted and present; they are of medium size
and exhibit one possible cavity over the crown of the upper right
second incisor. The heaviest tooth wear occurs diagonally on the lower
buccal and upper lingual surfaces and is generally third degree
( enamel worn entirely off ).
Burial L: A reconstructed skull of a middle-aged male, approximately 35 to 40 years of age. No artificial flattening was indicated although
natural lambdoid flattening does occur.
The upper dentition is seriously diseased and deformed. The only
teeth remaining on the right side are the canine, second premolar, and
the three molars; on the left side are the canine, and first and second
molars. The two first incisors were apparently lost either shortly before death or after death. The right second premolar grew in a horizontal plane with the crown directed over the lingual surface of the
alveolar process . The left second premolar was lost before death and
the alveolus is partially absorbed.
The right and left first molars were contained by the surrounding
teeth in such a manner as to cause them to grow in an elongate manner
with the roots on the buccal side well outside the alveolar process. The
left second molar also shows some elongation. The second and third
molars on the right side appear normal. An abcess immediately behind
the left second molar has reduced the alveolar process to a thin shell
of bone about 2 mm. thick and exposed the root of the left second
molar.
The lower dentition does not appear diseased, but is heavily worn.
Wear, upper and lower, is fourth degree (crowns worn off markedly) .
Burial!: A well preserved skull of a young adult female , approximately 20 to 25 years of age. No artificial deformation was seen, although natural lambdoid flattening does occur. This burial was the
only one to show wormian bones: four in the lambdoid suture and one
in the left temporo-parietal suture. The teeth are all erupted and
present. They are of medium size, show no caries and exhibit second
degree wear (dentine visible ). The shovel-shaped concavities, common in the American Indian, are present on the upper incisors of this
individual.
The fifth skull (no burial designation given ) examined was one of
the first found upon discovery of the site and was subsequently turned
over to the Houston Museum of Natural Science by the Sheriff of
Galveston County. Although precise provenience data are lacking, the
approximate location of this burial is known. It consists only of the
posterior half of the vault of what was possibly a young (20- 30?

year old) female . Only one measurement and limited morphological
observations were possible.
The area between lambda and the right parietal eminence, an area
of approximately 4 by 6 em., has been thinned to about 4 mm. thickness. Normal bone thickness in the corresponding position on the left
parietal is nine millimeters. The central portion of the affected area
exhibits a rough bony growth. The exact nature of this lesion is not
known at this time.
CONCLUSION

The gross characteristics of the four crania upon which reasonably
complete information is available, may be summarized as follows.
1. The males and one female skull are relatively long and narrow,
giving rise to an average cranial index of 74.6, which is dolichocranic
or long-headed. The one burial measured for maximum length and
breadth while still in the ground, but not one of those studied at the

161

CRANIA FROM JAMAICA BEACH SITE

museum, had a cranial index of 81, which is brachycranic or roundheaded.
2. The cranial capacity (computed) of the males averages 1505 cc. ,
that of the female is 12 70 cc.
3. The skulls are high-vaulted with a slender face in both the upper
and over-all proportions. The noses are also very slender.
4. The orbital index shows the orbits of the males to be slightly
elongated and the orbits of the female to be more nearly equidimensional.
5. In two of the skulls, the molar and premolar teeth are worn
diagonally, with the maxillary teeth wom most heavily on the lingual
surface and the mandibular teeth wom most heavily on the buccal
surface.
6. Only in one skull are the incisors sufficiently unworn to show
clearly shovel-shaped concavities.
7. Generally, the facial protrusion is on the order of 70 degrees, and
the alveolar protrusion is as low as 53 degrees in the males and 46
degrees in the female.
8. With respect to the morphological observations, little pattem
emerges in this small a sample and these characteristics can best be
examined in tabular form (Table 4 ) .
9. Comparisons of the measurements of the Jamaica Beach burials
with those from the nearby sites of Oso and Caplen (Woodbury, 1937 )
and Addicks (Aten, 1964: 7; Newman, 1953: 259) reveals some apparent differences. However, we cannot expect the full range of
morphological variation in the population of a site to be present in an
unselected sample of five specimens; thus it is felt that any conclusions with respect to morphological similarity or dissimilarity at this
time would be premature and hazardous.
10. The burial complex at Jamaica Beach shares some cultural
traits with the Caplen Site on Bolivar Peninsula (Campbell, 1957:
468 ) and the Addicks Basin sites west of Houston (Wheat, 1953: 247 ).
A trait list is presented below:

Especially intriguing here is the preoccupation with an easterly or
westerly orientation of the remains. It is difficult, however, to assess
any direct relationship, especially without considering a trait list for
the midden portion of each site, which is lacking for Jamaica Beach.
