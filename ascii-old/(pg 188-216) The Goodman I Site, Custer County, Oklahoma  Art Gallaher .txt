THE GOODMAN I SITE
CUSTER COUNTY, OKLAHOMA*
BY

A~w

GALLAHER

The Goodman I site was reported to the Department of
Anthropology of the University of Oklahoma in the latter
part of January, 1941, by Mr. Boone Goodman on whose
farm the site is located. Mr. Goodman first noticed the site
when he discovered a large piece of wattle which had been
exposed on the surface as the result of plowing. He immediately recognized the importance of the find, and is to
be commended for his prompt report to proper authorities.
Excavation was begun on February 10, 1941, under the
general direction of Dr. Forrest E. Clements, with Lynn
Howard acting as supervisor. W.P.A. labor was employed.
Thanks are due to Professor J. Willis Stovall, Director of
the Museum, for identification of the animal bones; to Professor C. A. Merrit, Department of Geology, for identification of caliche used in tempering pottery; to Professor
Karl Schmitt, Department of Anthropology, for helpful
hints on correlative material; and especially to Professor
R. E. Bell, Chairman of the Department of Anthropology, for
ideas on organization of material, and for editing the manuscript.
The site is located on the first terrace of the west bank
of the Washita River in Custer County, Oklahoma, one-half
mile west and one-quarter mile south of the town of Stafford. It was surveyed and laid off in a north-south and
east-west direction at intervals of ten feet, the lines being
numbered, beginning with 1, etc. The lanes formed by eastwest lines were known as rows whereas the lanes formed
by north-south lines were called alleys, with the stake in the
lower right-hand corner used as the designating marker for
each square. Three primary areas were excavated, these
being designated on the map as Excavation 1, House 1 and
sMateria]s available to the author were a quarterly rel~ort written by ~ioward~
~ sketches of houses, several photographs of the excavation, and the excavated
tvnatorlal. Field notes were missing, and a trip to the area revealed little because
excavation had been filled in and replanted with grass.

House 2, and in addition, test pits of variable depths were
sunk at random over an area approximately one hundred
and fifty yards square. Excavation was by four inch levels,
with six levels (or twenty-four inches) being the deepest
excavation point. A more detailed summary of the excavated area is given in Figure 9.
FEATURES
Houses
Concentrations of grooved wattle suggest the possibility of
two houses at this site. Several post holes were discovered,
but no complete patterns noted.
The mass of wattle unearthed at House No. 1 indicates
the structure to have been about twenty-four feet square.
An enlarged plan is given in Figure 8. Four center post
holes are arranged in an approximate square pattern in
the central part of the house; a fire pit is centrally located
between these four posts. Seven post holes are on the
periphery of the wattle concentration, and in the northwest
corner of the house there is an eight foot square offset, rising approximately ten inches above the floor level and
forming sort of a platform.
House No. 2, a.little to the north, and some one hundred
feet to the east of house No. 1, appears to be about sixteen
feet by twenty feet. A fire pit is found in ~he center of the
house, and there is a single post hole to the north and
south, each equidistant from the fire pit. Location is given
on Figure 9.
From available information indications are that irregularly shaped houses of wattle and daub construction were
the customary dwelling units. Apparently center poles were
utilized for support, and there is a strong possibility that
smaller poles were placed around the outer edge of the house.
A fire pit was located between the central pole supports.
Cache Pits
Three shallow pits are found in the vicinity of House No.
1 all of which are so small and sha!low that the investigator

The Goodman I Site, Custer County, Oklahoma

191

doubts their use as cache pits. These small pits are designated P1, P2, and P3 on Figure 9. P1 is one foot and ten
inches in diameter, and one foot three inches deep; P2 is
three feet three inches in diameter, and one foot four inches
deep; P3 is three feet nine inches in diameter, and only five
inches deep. No information is available on the content of
these three pits.
Four cache pits are found in the Excavation 1 Area, and
with the exception of cache No. 1 they are fairly well documented. They are designated as C1, C2, C3, and C4 on
Figure 9. No information is available on C1. C2 is four
feet four inches in diameter, and four feet three inches
deep, and contained several animal bones, including a fragment of a scapula hoe and a piece of worked bone (presumably a flesher). In addition, one bone bead, two mussel
shells, a small metate, twenty pottery sherds, and a small,
retouched, flake knife were found in this cache. C3 is fivefeet and three inches in diameter, and four feet and ten
inches deep, and revealed four shell fragments, some animal bones, a flint scraper, and an undetermined number
of pottery sherds. C4 is three feet and three inches deep,
and is somewhat bell shaped, with a top diameter of four
feet, and a bottom diameter of four feet and five inches. In
it was found two pottery sherds, one small mussel shell,
and several animal bones.
The cache pits at this site range from around three to five
feet in depth, and from four to five feet in diameter.
In
view of the contents it is possible that the pits could have
been used part of the year for food storage, and upon removing the food they were then filled with refuse.
Fire Pits
One fire pit was found in Excavation 1 Area, and is designated on Figure 9. This well defined feature was found at
a depth of two feet and seven inches below the surface.
The pit was circular, with straight sides and concave base,
and contained a few artifacts which were found scattered
among a large amount of ash and burnt rock. These consist

192

of four fragments of charred bone awl, a beveled, diamond
shaped knife, a small piano-convex scraper, fragments of
another, two pottery sherds, animal bones, shell fragments,
and a large lump of charcoal. A few pieces of wattle ~vere
found nearby, although no house is reported near the fire
pit.

a fire pit in each of the two houses. The pit in
1 is eighteen inches in diameter, but all other
is lacking on it, as well as on the fire pit in
2.
Bu~a~

In the early part of January, 1951, Mr. E. A. Auxier,
present occupant of the Goodman farm, reported to the
University Museum that while in the process of digging a
storm cellar he had uncovered two burials, located approximately one hundred and fifty yards from the original excavation site. He kindly donated the material to the Museum,
whereupon January 16, 1951, Dr. Bell and Dr. Schmitt of
the Anthropology Department investigated the burial site.
Burial 1, an adult male, represents a flexed burial found
in a pit about three feet and ten inches deep, and about two
feet and six inches in diameter, with the skull to the east
and legs to the west. The body appeared to have been dropped into the pit with the legs extended "up into the air."
Associations were a small stone elbow pipe, a clam shell,
and several broken stones, including a mano fragment.
Burial 2, also an adult male, was found in a pit about
four feet and ten inches deep, and approximately three feet
in diameter, and as in Burial 1, the head was to the east.
The body was lying on its back, with legs folded and the
knees pointing south, and with the arms extended from the
elbow outward from the body with the hands "close
together." Two pottery vessels, both placed to the south
of the skeleton a few inches in front of the hands, were
found in an upright position. Twenty-nine small olivella
shell beads appeared under the chin, and a flint knife, lying
under the upper arm, presumably the left, was also found.

The Goodma~ I Site, Custer County, Oklahoma

193

Accompanying photographs of the two pots and the knife
are included.

(Plate 25, A.)

Presumably these two burials represent a part of the
cemetery associated with the nearby village.

The two pots

found with Burial 2 are of the same type pottery that was
excavated, and in view of the proximity of the graves to
the village area, this assumption seems justified.

The

graves were represented by circular or oval pits dug into the
earth.

The body was then placed into the pit in a flexed

position, usually with the head to the east. Both burials had
grave offerings in association.
CHIPPED STONE OBJECTS
Projectile Points
The collection of chipped stone objects from this site includes seven projectile points (Plate 24, D). Four of these
points are similar enough that they can be considered as

FIGUP~ 9

Area

excavations at Goodman I site, Custer county, Oklahoma.

194

representing the same type, whereas the remaining three
exhibit distinct individual differences.
The four similar points, one from a burial, and each of
the three others from a separate layer, are triangular in
shape, unnotched, with straight sides and base.

Three of

these points are fairly short and broad, while the fourth
is longer and more slender, with the range in length being
from three-fourths inch to one inch.

In all cases chipping

is on both faces.
There is one small point, approximately three-fourths
inch in length, exhibiting double notching on the sides.
The upper notch is about one-fourth inch down from the
base, and the second notch is about five-eights inch down
from the base, with the base itself being slightly concave.
Again, both faces have been chipped.
There is one barbed point present, one and three-fourths
inches long, with fairly uniform body width to about onehalf the length, where it curves to form the point. The
rounded, rather blunt barbs join the body approximately
one-third down from the top. The base rounds outward
from the barbs, with the basal line being slightly concave.
The last point is approximately seven-eighths inch in
length, roughly triangular in shape, slightly concave sides,
and with a definitely convex base. Each side projects slightly beyond the base, these pointed projections sloping into
the convex basal line..
Without exception the projectile points have been chipped on both faces. The original fracture surface is seldom
present, chipping in all cases having been quite extensive,
and particularly skillful on the edges. Flint’ is the material
utilized in manufacture of projectile points, and with the
exception of the white barbed point, color ranges from pink
to red.

Knives
This site produced four knives, each of which is different.
The types represented are two triangular varieties, a four
bladed implement, and a flake example.
The flake knife was found in cache 2, and represents a long
narrow flake, thin in cross section, with rechipping all along
one edge. The material is a multi-colored flint.
The four bladed knife is roughly diamond-shaped, and is
of the alternate bevel type, Plate 24, B. It is tong, rather
narrow, and fairly thin in cross section, and is manufactured
from a dark gray flint banded with red to light gray.
The triangular knife has been worked on all three edges,
Plate 24 B. The base is straight, sides are convex, tapering
to a point, and the cross section reveals a compressed oval
outline. The edges have been finely chipped, with the
entire blade representing secondary chipping. The material
is a grayish brown flint.
The fourth knife, a very unusual type, was found in
Burial 2. At the longest point this knife is about six and
three-fourths inches, and is characterized by a relatively
pointed spur, three and one-half inches in height from base
to point, which leans to one side. The accompanying photograph will better illustrate this unusual artifact, (Plate
24, A).
Scrapers
This site yielded twenty scrapers, eleven of which can be
classified as end scrapers, and nine of which can be called
side scrapers. Both types of scrapers were found in all
levels of the site, indicating homogenity for the habitation
period.
The end scrapers are predominantly piano-convex, ranging in size from seven-eighths inch to one and five-eighths
inches. The ventral surfaces represent the unretouched
original flake surface, which is in most cases more or less
concave, two of the longer specimens evidencing pronounced
concavity. The shaping of the instrument has been attained

198

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

by removing flakes from the dorsal surface, and in most
instances the cutting end has been finely worked about the
edges. Approximately one-half the end scrapers have been
worked on three edges, whereas the remainder have been
worked primarily on the end. Two of these are roughly
triangular, the rest being more oval in outline. Four of
the specimens are quite thick at the scraping edge, while the
remainder have approximately equal thickness throughout,
tapering somewhat at the cutting edge. Three of the scrapers have a markedly flat dorsal surface, whereas two others
have a pronounced media! line, the latter two exhibiting
the best chipping along the cutting edges. All end scrapers
are made from variable colored flint, ranging from light
gray to dark red, with correspondingly mottled tints in
between.
There is a wide range of shapes and sizes found among the
side scrapers. Six of them are definitely triangular shape,
with the remaining five rather rectangular.
The triangular types all show chipping on two edges, there
being two specimens which have been chipped on three; one
of the latter, a broad thin flake, has very fine chipping on
the cutting edges. With one exception, all triangular scrapers show relatively thin cross sections. In only two cases is
there evidence of chipping on both faces, the chipping being
confined primarily to the edges.
The rectangular side scrapers are also variable. Three
exhibit chipping on two edges, while the remainder have
chipping on only one. One small speciman has chipping on
the dorsal and ventral faces, but the others show only the
original flaking scars. The material for the manufacture
of side scrapers is a variable colored flint, ranging from
light gray to dark gray, dark reds, and medium yellow tints.
Miscellaneous,

In addition to the above mentioned chipped stone items,
there were sixteen flint flakes. There were also three
quartzite flakes, any one of which could have been used for
a scraper. Two other pieces of flint exhibit sufficiently

The Goodman I Site, Cus~er County, Oklahoma’

199

sharp cutting edges to have been used as scrapers, although
they show no signs of having been reworked.

There are

two pieces of flint which exhibit evidence for having been
worked, but as to what category they would come under is
debatable.

Presumably they represent unfinished or dis-

carded material.
GROUND STONE OBJECTS

There are six manos or grinding stones, three of which
can definitely be placed in the same category, whereas the
other three are somewhat different.
Three of the stones are oval in shape, and of the three, one
in particular approaches a round cross section, whereas the
remaining two in cross section would represent more of a
compressed oval shape. Two of these stones have a relatively fiat side which represents the side exhibiting the most
wear, and the other stone appears to have been used equally
on both surfaces.
Another stone has been worn flat on two sides, leaving
two other sides somewhat round, and pitted as though the
instrument had been pecked into shape. Resting the stone
on one of the flat surfaces reveals somewhat of a rectangular
instrument, two of the sides slightly curved outward.
There is a long rectangular mano present, the approximate
dimensions of which are three and three-~ourths by two
and one-fourth by eight inches. The principal composition
is hematite, and the upper surface exhibits a concave curvature which appears to have been chipped and pitted, hence
there may have been some use of the hematite as pigment.
The lower surface and side surfaces are relatively flat,
although they are not too smooth.
The last stone has been broken, but in its original state
must have been an oval mano. Cross section reveals a
rectangular artifact. The upper and lower sides apparently
were both used, although one shows considerably more

200

wear than does the other.
is worn fairly smooth.

The rounded portion of the stone

Metates
There are fargments of four metates. Two of these have
been fashioned from a fine reddish colored sandstone material, while the other two are of a medium grained, reddish
colored granite. All show wear on only one surface, and
indications are that grinding was by a rotary motion.
The two granite pieces are not from the same artifact,
one being a little coarser than the other, and of a slightly
darker color. The larger piece shows a good portion of the
rim area, and exhibits evidence of burning along the rim
edge, and along one side of the fracture. The small piece
is from the interior portion of the basin.
The two sandstone pieces are of different composition, one
being much darker colored, and of a somewhat finer grain
than the other. The dark stone, about two inches square
by one inch thick, represents only a small portion of the
original stone. The larger stone, which is roughly rectangular in shape, is about seven and one-half by eight by one
inches. It has been centrally worn, causing a depression in
the center, leaving the two sides somewhat higher. Both
of these artifacts are very smooth.
Abraiding Stones
There are several pieces of sandstone present, but there is
only one which is definitely grooved as the result of use,
Plate 24, H. This grooved stone has been broken, but there
are a number of grooves of varying depth which at one time
probably sufficed as an arrow shaft smoother. A couple
of smaller stones show signs of having been worn smooth,
but the function of these stones is in doubt.
Ceremonial Objects of Stone
The one elbow pipe found with Burial 1 is the single pipe
represented in this site, (Plate 24, I). This small pipe is
made from a yellow colored, fine grain stone. The slightly

The Goodman I Si$e, Custer County,:Ok~ahoma

201

bulging bowl meets the stem at an approximate right angle,
both the~stem and bowl being approximately one inch in
length. The accompanying photograph illustrates the features of this artifact.
BONE OBJECTS
Hoes
One fairly complete bison scapula hoe and the fragments
of two_others were unearthed at this site, (Plate 24, E). All
exhibit some modifications of the bone as a result of the
manufacturing process. The suprascapular border has been
beveled to insure sharpness to the blade, and a rather high
degree of polish, as a result of use, is present of the flat
portion of the blade.
The one speciman which is primarily intact appears to be
well worn. Apparently the hoe was sharpened as it became dulled, and there obviously was no attempt to trim
the blade to remove irregularities. Possibly the tool was
employed in the hand, there being no visible evidence of
halting.
The ~remaining two implements are represented by fragments and show nothing unusual. One is a portion of the
suprascapular fossa, whereas the other two fragments are
from the anterior ridge of the scapula. All fragments have
a high polish, and all have been subjected to fire.
Digging Stick Points
There are two digging stick points present, both manu~factured fron~l bison tibia. The two fragments are each about
two inches in length, both exhibit use polish, and both have
been subjected to fire. The cutting edge on the upper side
has been beveled to give somewhat of a wedge appearance.
Fteshers
There is one flesher, about five and one-half inches in
length, that has been fashioned from the anterior ridge of
bison scapula. The flesher evidences a good use polish on

Texas Archeologica~ a~d Paleontological Soc~et~

only one surface.

The instrument has been broken diagon-

ally across one end, giving the appearance of a knife blade.
Awls
There are pieces of two awls present, one of which is one
inch in length, the other approximately three and one-half
inches. The two instruments, both of which have been subjected to fire, presumably have been manufactured from
fish spine, Plate 24, F.

Cross section of the upper extremity

reveals somewhat of a rectangular shape, with the implement tapering to a round cros~ section as it approaches the
working end. The points are missing from both awls. The
entire surface of the awls shows polish as the result of use.
Flakers
One flaker was found. It consists of the main portion of
the original, and is about three and one-fourth inches in
length. Manufacture was from the sternal rib of a deer.
The flaking end has been beveled to a point, the latter being evidenced on the flat surface of the rib, Plate 24, G.
Beads
There are two beads present, both manufactured from bird
bone. One has been finished and polished, whereas the
other has never been completely worked.
The finished bead is one and one-fourth inches in length,
and one-fourth inch in diameter, with rounded ends and
polished body, Plate 24, J. The other bead is about threefourths inch in length, and less than one-fourth inch in
diameter. It exhibits some polish, but the ends haven’t been
worked as have those on the finished ornament.
Miscellaneous

There is the distal end of a deer cannon bone which shows
some evidence of having been worked. There are shallow
p~_rallel striations which have been cut into the bone, extending in horizontal direction on two sides of the shaft
just below the condyles. There are also several pieces of

The Goodman I Site, Custer County, Oklahoma"

203

bone which exhibit use polish, but these are of such proportions that the original implement cannot be determined.
Shell
There was considerable shell present, but none that
has been worked. However, many of the pieces would have
been suitable for spoons, scrapers or other purposes. There
were also several olivella shell beads found with Burial 2.
Clay
There are three small balls of clay. One of these is a
globular ball about one inch in diameter; another is somewhat oval in cross section; and the third, which has been
burned, is fairly rough in appearance.
There is a small conical piece of clay which obviously is
from a small figurine. It is about one inch in length, tapering to a point at the top, and has an irregular base of about
three-eighths inch in diameter. Presumably it is the bottom of a figurine.
Several pieces of baked clay wattle were found, these
being pure clay with no tempering material present, although
a few pieces exhibit irregular markings on the outer surface. In addition, an irregular piece of pinkish-red clay
has been drilled through the center. This object is rough
and pitted, and evidences no discernable shape.
Pottery
A total of four hundred and seventy-four sherds were
found, one hundred and ten of which are from the surface,
and the remaining three hundred and sixty-four from the
excavation. There are two main types represented which
will be designated as Stafford Plain and Stafford Cordmarked. In both types the tempering material is predominantly caliche,2 the latter being frequently combined with
grit, sand, limestone, clay, or shell. Of the excavated sherds,
two hundred and seventy-two are plain and ninety-two

are cordmarked. Test pits~ revealed forty-two plain sherds
and four cordmarked. Cache pit No. 2 yielded twenty-one
plain sherds; cache pit No. 3 contained three plain sherds
and four cordmarked; and cache pit No. 4 had within it two
plain sherds. Both the StaJford Plain and Sta]ford Cordmarked are characterized by an excessive amount of caliche
tempering material, although there is a single sherd exhibiting bone temper, and a few having only clay or sand. A
more detailed classification of tempering and surface finish
is given in Table No. 1. No basic differences in distribution of either type could .be noted in any of the six excavated
levels.

The above table is by no means completely accurate.
However, it gives a general idea of the pottery which was
excavated at this site, and of the use of caliche as a temperingmaterial. In many instances it was difficult to deter-

mine which tempering classification a sherd should come
under, and in all such cases the-author used the dominant
tempering material to make the separation.
STAFFORD PLAIN
Paste:
Method of manufacture:. Large coils, poorly welded together.
Temper: Most common single element is caliche: most
. popular combinations are caliche and grit, caliche and
shell, or caliche, sand and grit. Other tempering materials- utilized were clay, limestone, and hematite~ In
most cases the secondary tempering materials were combined with caliche. Amount varies from a small quantity to an excessive amount, with the consistency varying from finely ground particles to coarse particles,
both of which are visible to the naked eye.
Texture: Cros~ section appearance is fine to medium
coarse. Usually quite compact, although those sherds
tempered with clay appear quite porous. Sand tempering material feels rough to the touch.
Hardness: 1.5 to 4.0, with 3.0 the most common.
Color: Core ranges from light gray to black, with tans
and reds. Outer surfaces range from light to dark gray,
and from tan to reddish brown, the latter being most
prominent. Many sherds appear to have been overfired.
SURFACE FINISH: Poorly smoothed exteriors and interiors with frequent, indications of brush mark striations.
Both exteriors and interiors evidence pits resulting from
leaching out of the caliche temper. Many sherds have
large caliche particles visible on the surface.
DECORATION: One sherd has a curved applica strip rising about 1/16 inch above the surface. Two rim sherds
show paired projections above the rim contour. The

Texas Archeological and paleontological Society

208

projections are rounded and of the same thickness as
the lip. These projections lie immediateiy where the
strap joins the body and rim. One disc-like object has
several holes drilled in it.
FoTT~:

Rim: Slants outward usually. Some cases of almost vertical rims, and one which appears to slant inward very
slightly.
Lip: Most commonly narrowed or rounded.
Body: Variable size jars, with expanded bodies. Strap
handles are present on outward flaring rim forms, being
anchored across the juncture of the body and rim.
Base: Both round and fiat are represented.
Thickness: Lip from 1/16 to 3/16 inch; rim and body sherds
from 1/16 to 3/8 inch, with the average around 1/4 inch.
PROBABLE RELATIONSHIPS: On the surface several
sherds resemble Nocona Plain, and several resemble
Lindsay Plain3. However, the caliche tempering material isolates Stafford Plain as a local variant, although
it is reasonably certain that it is related to both of the
above types.
STAFFORD CORDMARKED
Paste:
Method of manufacture: Fairly large coils, poorly welded
together.
Temper: Most common is caliche, or a combination of
caliche and sand. Shell, limestone, clay, hematite and
bone were also used. These were in most cases combined with caliche. The amount varies from a small
quantity to an excessive amount. In some cases the
caliche is readily visible on the surface to the naked
eye.

209

Texture: Cross section appearance is medium coarse to
coarse, with the caliche frequently having a sugary appearance.

Sand tempering material appears fairly fine.

Hardness: 1.5 to 3.5, with 2.5 the most common.
Color: A!most always a medium gray to black core.

Sur-

face varies from tan to black, with dark gray predominating.

Evidences of fire blackening on some sherds.

SURFACE FI~IISH: Exterior is cordmarked, and in all but
three sherds smoothing has occured after cordmarking.
In several instances polishing has occurred after cordmarking and smoothing. Cordma~kings are perpendicular to the rim in all but one sherd. Interiors are imperfectly smoothed; a few are grass wiped. Many interiors are quite porous, and several exteriors exhibit
leaching depressions caused by leaching out of the
caliche temper. Rim lips are generally smooth, although a few have been cordmarked.
DECORATION: None.
FORM:
Rim: In most cases vertical. A few rims have a very
slight outward flare of the upper 1/16 inch. One sherd
has a hole drilled approximately one inch below the lip
edge.
Lip: Commonly flattened or rounded, with occasional
thinning.
Body: Vessel shapes not completely known.
Base: Unknown.
Thickness: Lip from 1/16 to 5/8 inch; body sherds from
1/4 to 3/8 inch, with the majority around 3/8 inch.
PROBABLE RELATIONSHIPS: Except for the caliche
tempering material Stafford Cordmarked closely resembles that found along the Washita River in Garvin,

210

Texas Archeologic~il and Paleontological Society

County, Oklahoma4, and also Stamper Cordmarked~.
It most nearly resembles the Washita River pottery in
that it is very thick and heavy. A few of the sherds
resemble some of the cordmarked-smoothed sherds of
the Antelope Creek focus,, but the latter are-harder,
thinner, with much finer cord impressions. ~ The Stafford pottery evidently is related to both the Antelope
Creek and Washita River materials, the.primary difference being in the adaptation of caliche as a tempering
material.
POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS
Geographically the Goodman I site is located approximately midway between the Lee site of Garvin County,
Oklahoma, and the Optima site of Texas County, .Oklahoma. This is illustrated by the map on Figure 8. To
facilitate comparison between these three sites, the following Comparatige Trait List has been evaluated, patterned
after the one used by Watson in the description of the
Optima Focus.

The traft list is not too informative for detailed rela~ionships, although it can be readily seen that a broad relation-

ship between these ~ three sites exists.

215

On.the basis of pot,

tery comparison.s Goodman t is somewhat closer 40.Lee .~han
to Optima, but even in this respect, Goodman presumably.
would be in a different*foeus.

However, Some of’the more

important traits shared by Goodma.n I, and Lee which aren’t
found at Optima should be noted.

These are the presence

of bell shaped cache pits, shell and limestone pottery tera~
pers, presence of strap handles on pottery vessels, bone
beamers and b0~e beads. The general appearance of the
Pottery would also indicate that there is a closer relationship in this respect between Goodman I and Lee, than there
is between Goodman I and Optima.
At present the most important traits shared by Goodman
and Optima which aren’t found in the Lee site are houses
and burials. However, it is now known that further excavation in Garvin County will reveal both of these traits in
the vicinity of theLee excavation..It should also be noted
that there is quite a lot of difference in the houses found at
Optima and Goodman, and in ~his respect it is interesting
to note the different manner in which both groups utilized
caliche. The Optima peoples used caliche sl~bs in constructing their dwellings, while further to the south the
Goodman inhabitants used caliche as a tempering material
for pottery, and none whatsoever was found in either of the
two houses. This can probably be accbunted for by the
easy access to caliche in the panhandle area, whereas the
author wasn’t able to find any outstanding deposits near
the Goodman site, although various deposits are known
throughout Custer County.

CONCLUSION
Existing data are too incomplete to say definitely that
Goodman is more closely related to one of the above sites
than it is to the other, although it would appear that perhaps there is a slight inclination toward a closer affinity
with the Lee site. At any rate it appears fairly evident that
the three sites were culturally related, and existed contem-

Archeolog~ca~ and Paleontological ,.~ociety

poraneously sometime around 1300 to 1400, although it is
not possible to make a correlation with any historic tribe
at the present time. The evidence indicates the economy to
have been a combination hunting and agricultural type.
