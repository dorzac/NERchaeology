For the USACE, Fort Worth District and in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, archaeologists conducted a 100
percent pedestrian survey of 1,874 acres at Wright Patman Lake and Sam Rayburn Reservoir, Texas. During the survey, archaeologists excavated 685
shovel tests and documented 60 archaeological sites. Prehistoric artifacts observed and collected during shovel testing included lithic debitage, modified
flake tools, bifaces, biface fragments, drills, perforators, pitted stones, ground stone tools, an abrading stone, flake cores, a shaft straightener, dart points
dating from the Late Paleoindian through the Woodland periods, Late Prehistoric arrow points dating from the Early through the Late Caddo periods, firecracked rock, undecorated and decorated ceramic vessel sherds, a ceramic pipe fragment, a clay plug, a plainware ceramic bottle, a ceramic bowl with a
Barkman engraved decorative motif, burned clay, charred organics, unidentified faunal remains, and mussel shell. Historic-age artifacts included shards of
window and vessel glass, milk glass shards, undecorated and decorated whiteware ceramic sherds, stoneware ceramic sherds, ironware ceramic sherds,
round and square nails, miscellaneous metal fragments, fragments from a cast-iron stove, a button, a porcelain knob, concrete fragments, and brick
fragments. Of the 60 sites, one site (41CS386) was evaluated as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. This site should be avoided and protected from
adverse impacts. Eighteen sites are of unknown NRHP eligibility and should be avoided until their eligibility can be evaluated. The remaining 41 sites are
recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no further work is warranted at these sites.

A Cultural Resource Survey of 1,874 Acres at Sam Rayburn Reservoir and Wright Patman Lake, Texas

ABSTRACT
This report documents the results and management recommendations of a cultural resource survey
conducted at Sam Rayburn Reservoir and Wright Patman Lake in Cass, Nacogdoches, and San
Augustine Counties, Texas. Totaling 1,874 acres, the survey encompassed four separate parcels
owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District. The USACE
proposes timber harvesting at these locations. Therefore, in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, a cultural resource inventory
was required prior to the undertaking. Any cultural resources documented within the Area of
Potential Effects (APE), defined as the 1,874 acres where timber harvesting is proposed, will be
considered during the planning and implementation of the proposed undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork took place during January, February, and March of 2018 by prime
contractor Poznecki Camarillo, Inc. (PCI), with support from subcontractor AmaTerra
Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra). Fieldwork included a 100 percent pedestrian survey
accompanied by selective shovel testing within high probability areas. Across the 1,874-acre APE,
2,238 shovel tests were excavated at a rate of roughly 1.19 shovel tests per acre. A total of 685
shovel tests contained cultural materials, resulting in the discovery and documentation of 60
archeological sites and 12 Isolated Finds. The sites include 16 previously recorded (41CS103,
41CS104, 41CS105, 41CS106, 41CS107, 41CS108, 41CS109, 41CS110, 41CS111, 41CS116,
41CS117, 41CS118, 41NA131, 41SA96, 41SA128, 41SA137) and 44 newly discovered sites.
Prehistoric artifacts observed and collected during shovel testing included lithic debitage, modified
flake tools, bifaces, biface fragments, drills, perforators, pitted stones, ground stone tools, an
abrading stone, flake cores, a shaft straightener, dart points dating from the Late Paleoindian
through the Woodland periods, Late Prehistoric arrow points dating from the Early through the
Late Caddo periods, fire-cracked rock, undecorated and decorated ceramic vessel sherds, a ceramic
pipe fragment, a clay plug, a plainware ceramic bottle, a ceramic bowl with a Barkman engraved
decorative motif, burned clay, charred organics, unidentified faunal remains, and mussel shell.
Historic-age artifacts included shards of window and vessel glass, milk glass shards, undecorated
and decorated whiteware ceramic sherds, stoneware ceramic sherds, ironware ceramic sherds,
round and square nails, miscellaneous metal fragments, fragments from a cast-iron stove, a button,
a porcelain knob, concrete fragments, and brick fragments. Sixteen (16) features, dating to both
the Prehistoric and Historic periods, were recorded: brick scatters (n=5), earthen depressions
(n=3), a historic-period trash midden, pit features (n=2), a scatter of burned sandstone, shell
middens (n=3), and a burial. All collected artifacts and project-related documentation will be
curated at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
Of the 60 sites, one site (41CS386) is evaluated as eligible for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP). This site should be avoided and protected from adverse impacts. In
addition, 18 sites are of undetermined NRHP eligibility and should be avoided until their eligibility
can be evaluated. The remaining 41 sites are recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
and no further work is warranted at these sites.

Chapter 1 - Project Description
1.1

The Undertaking

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District is responsible for managing
certain federally-owned lands in East Texas, which are directly associated with lakes, reservoirs,
and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include the 114,500 acres at the
Sam Rayburn Reservoir in Angelina, Nacogdoches, Jasper, Sabine, and San Augustine counties,
Texas, and the 45,063 acres at Wright Patman Lake in Bowie and Cass counties, Texas. The
USACE is proposing selective timber harvesting at four locations, or parcels, adjacent to these
lakes and/or reservoirs.
Timber harvesting removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through singletree selection. Removal of these trees often disturbs the ground surface, while extensive
subsurface disturbance is minimal. According to a study conducted by the Minnesota Forest
Resources Council (MFRC 2002), disturbances resulting from timber harvesting are often
confined to the upper 10 centimeters below the ground surface (cmbs), with faunal remains
sustaining the most damage when compared to lithic and ceramic materials. A second study
(Kuennen et al. 1979) indicated that the compaction of the soils can extend to a depth of
approximately 40 cmbs. Both studies concluded that disturbances are often limited to those areas
subject to heavy traffic (multiple passes) by harvest equipment. Coincidentally, the upper 40 cmbs
are often significantly affected by anthropogenic (e.g., plowing) and natural (e.g., fossorial
animals) processes (Charles Frederick, [2017] personal communication).
The proposed undertaking would occur on land owned and controlled by the USACE, a United
States federal agency. Therefore, compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, is required prior to project implementation. The
project’s Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources is defined as the footprint of
the proposed project to the maximum depth of impact(s), including all easements and projectspecific locations. The APE for archeological resources covered a total area of 1,874 acres. While
the exact depth of impacts is unknown and would likely vary across the APE, experimental studies
(MFRC 2002; Kuennen et al. 1979) suggest that disturbances caused during timber harvesting
would likely be confined to the upper 40 cmbs.

Summary of Findings

Fieldwork took place intermittently between January 10, 2018 and March 7, 2018. Julian (“Drew”)
Sitters served as the project’s Principal Investigator. Heath Bentley and R. Bo Nelson served as
the project’s Field Director(s), while Truet Hinson and Sam McLellan assisted with field
investigations.
Fieldwork included manual excavation of 2,238 shovel tests and documented 60 sites, including
44 new archeological sites and 16 previously-recorded sites plus 12 Isolated Finds (IFs). The
previously recorded sites included 41CS103, 41CS104, 41CS105, 41CS106, 41CS107, 41CS108,
41CS109, 41CS110, 41CS111, 41CS116, 41CS117, 41CS118, 41NA131, 41SA96, 41SA128, and
April 2019

41SA137. Fieldwork recovered 4,444 items from surface and subsurface contexts including 2,800
chipped stone artifacts, 1,180 Native American ceramic sherds, 32 ground stone artifacts, 106 shell
fragments, 66 bone fragments, 32 pieces of burned rock and burned clay, 64 sherds of European
ceramic vessels, 111 glass shards, 47 metal items, and three other historic artifacts.
Based on the work reported herein, 41 sites are recommended ineligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and no further work is warranted at these sites.
Eighteen (18) sites are of undetermined significance on the basis of the survey level data obtained
during this investigation; these sites require further investigation before a clear evaluation of their
NRHP eligibility can be achieved. Finally, one site (41CS386) is evaluated as eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP. This site should be avoided and protected from adverse impacts.
This report has nine chapters and five appendices. The environmental setting and cultural
overview are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, respectively. Chapter 4 includes the field and
laboratory methodology implemented during the project, while the results of field investigations
are presented by reservoir in Chapters 5 and 6. The results of the prehistoric ceramic analysis at
Site 41CS386 is presented in Chapter 7. Management recommendations are presented in
Chapter 8. Lastly, a summary of findings is presented in Chapter 9, followed by bibliographic
references. Appendix A contains maps depicting shovel test locations, while Appendix B is a
tabular listing of all positive shovel tests by site. Appendices C and D contain site location maps
and Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) site forms, respectively; these two
appendices are of restricted distribution. Appendix E contains scans of all original excavation
forms.

Sam Rayburn Reservoir

Attoyac Bayou
Attoyac Bayou encompasses approximately 104 acres and consists of contiguous shoreline and
coves at the northwestern end of Sam Rayburn Reservoir in southeast Nacogdoches County, Texas
(Figure 1-3). Located on the Broaddus, TX U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle, the Attoyac Bayou parcel is almost entirely within Sam Rayburn
Reservoir’s maximum conservation pool level, with elevations ranging from 165 to 195 feet above
mean sea level (AMSL). Topographically, the parcel consists of interfluves and stream terraces
overlooking former creek channels. These landforms are overlain mostly by loamy alluvium with
soil profiles characterized by fine sandy loam underlain by sandy clay loam (Table 1-2). Multiple
unnamed drainages bisect the parcel before emptying into Attoyac Bayou.

Ayish Bayou
The Ayish Bayou parcel includes six areas totaling 151 acres in size at the southeastern end of
Sam Rayburn Reservoir in southeast San Augustine County, Texas (Figures 1-4 thru 1-8). These
areas consist mostly of contiguous shoreline and coves. Approximately 91 percent of the parcel
falls below Sam Rayburn Reservoir’s maximum conservation pool level, as shown on the Buck
Bay and Veach, TX USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps (Figures 1-4 thru Figure 18). Elevation across these areas ranges from 150 to 200 feet AMSL. Most of the Ayish Bayou
parcel is characterized by stream terraces, floodplains, and interfluves, bisected by a few unnamed
drainages. Soils encountered throughout Ayish Bayou consisted of fine sandy loam underlain by
sandy clay loam (Table 1-3).

Wright Patman Lake

Overlooking the Sulphur River in northern Cass County, the Flatwoods parcel totals approximately
1,408 acres (Figure 1-9). As shown on the Douglassville and Maud, TX USGS 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle maps (Figure 1-9), the entire parcel is within Wright Patman Lake’s
maximum conservation pool level and ranges in elevation from 225 to 255 feet AMSL.
Topographically, the parcel is characterized by wide stream terraces, upland ridges, and featureless
low-lying areas underlain by clay. While no waterways are depicted on topographic maps,
multiple drainages were observed within the parcel and Ballard Creek abuts the parcel’s southern
boundary. Soils are described as a sandy loam underlain by clay loam (Table 1-4).

The Overcup parcel is located at the westernmost end of Wright Patman Lake in northern Cass
County (Figure 1-10). Measuring 211 acres in size, the parcel’s elevation ranges from 225 to 285
feet AMSL. The Douglasville, TX USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map depicts most
of the Overcup parcel within the lake’s maximum conservation pool level. Interfluves and stream
terraces were the dominant topographic features observed across the parcel. Overcup soils are
characterized by a sandy loam underlain by clay loam (Table 1-5).

Chapter 2 - Environment
2.1

Sam Rayburn Reservoir

The Sam Rayburn Reservoir falls within the Southern Tertiary Uplands, a subregion of the SouthCentral Plains ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). Today, this area is often referred to as the “Piney
Woods,” which is 1 of the 10 ecological areas of Texas defined by Frank W. Gould (1975).
2.1.1

Physiography

The Southern Tertiary Uplands are characterized by “dissected irregular plains with some low,
rolling hills bisected by low to moderate gradient streams with sandy and silty substrates” (Griffith
et al. 2007:91). This subregion encompasses an area measuring 7,667 square miles in size and
ranges in elevation from 90 to 550 feet AMSL.
2.1.2

Climate

The climate at Sam Rayburn Reservoir is subtropical with hot, usually humid, and wet summers
with mild to cool winters (Peel et al. 2007). The region receives 47 to 58 inches of precipitation
per year (Griffith et al. 2007) and has a mean annual air temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)
(USDA-NRCS 2018).
2.1.3

Geology and Soils

The parcels at Sam Rayburn Reservoir are underlain by the Caldwell Formation (Eca), Yegua
Formation (EY), Fluvatile terrace deposits (Qt), and Alluvium (Qal). Dating to the Eocene Epoch,
the Caldwell Formation is characterized by clay and quartz sand, with a thickness ranging from 25
to 45 feet, while the Yegua Formation is described as clay, quartz, sand, and lignite ranging in
thickness from 600 to 1,000 feet. Younger formations include the Pleistocene-age Fluvatile terrace
deposits composed of gravel, sand, and silt, as well as Holocene-aged alluvium, which includes
low terrace deposits along streams consisting of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. This formation has a
variable thickness.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (2018), the parcels located at Sam Rayburn Reservoir
encompass 15 named soil groups (See Chapter 1.3.1). Typically, these soils are described as
having a fine sandy loam surface texture with loam to clay subsoils that range from poorly to welldrained (USDA-NRCS 2018). Soils found within the Southern Tertiary Uplands subregion consist
of Entisols, Vertisols, Inceptisols, and Mollisols. Entisols are soils that are unaltered from their
parent materials and lack subsurface horizons, while Vertisols are a clayey soil that shrink and
swell with changes in moisture content. As a result, “the shrinking of the soil and development of
wide cracks […] can cause mixing and physical deterioration of archeological remains” (Duffield
1970, cited in Story [1990:9-10]). Inceptisols are soils that form quickly through the alteration of
the parent material (Griffith et al. 2007) and Mollisols are characterized by a thick dark surface
horizon. Having a fertile surface horizon, Mollisols serve as important and productive agricultural
soils.

2.1.4

Biota

Historically, the Southern Tertiary Uplands was dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)bluestem (Schizachyrium spp. and Andropogon spp.) woodlands, with additional forest types
including shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-hardwood forests and mixed hardwood-loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda) forests (Griffith et al. 2007). In areas with a well-balanced supply of moisture,
American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and magnolia (Magnolia spp.)-beech-loblolly pine forests
flourish. Other plant species include southern sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), hollies or gallberry
(Ilex spp.), wax myrtles (Morella spp.), and wild azalea (Rhododendron spp.). Common aquatic
species found at the Sam Rayburn Reservoir include hydrilla (Hydrilla spp.), American lotus
(Nelumbo lutea), and pondweed (Potamogeton spp.) (TPWD 2018a).
The fauna found in the Southern Tertiary Uplands is similar to the fauna of the Tertiary Uplands
and Floodplains and Low Terraces subregions to the north (see Section 2.2.4). Mammals include
skunks (Mephitidae spp.), rabbits (Leporidae spp.), gophers (Geomyidae spp.), and mice (Mus
spp.) (Jelks 1965), while dominant fish species at the Sam Rayburn Reservoir consist of
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), crappie (Pomoxis spp.), catfish, white bass (Morone
chrysops), and sunfish (Centrarchidae spp.). One of the rarest snakes in North America, the
Louisiana pine snake (Pituophis ruthveni), is found within this subregion and is currently listed as
threatened in the State of Texas (Griffith et al. 2007).
2.1.5

Hydrology

Sam Rayburn Reservoir was constructed during the mid-twentieth century. Located roughly 10
miles northwest of the City of Jasper, the reservoir encompasses parts of five counties: Angelina,
Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San Augustine. Sam Rayburn Reservoir was formed through
the impoundment of the Angelina River in Jasper County. In 1955, Congress authorized the
construction of the reservoir for flood control, hydroelectric power generation, and water
conservation. The reservoir is the largest body of water in Texas, with a conservation pool level
of approximately 164 feet (114,500 surface acres) National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929
(NGVD29), and a flood control pool level of 173 feet above NGVD29 (142,700 surface acres).
The reservoir has approximately 750 miles (1,207 kilometers) of shoreline (USACE 2014) and a
maximum depth of 80 feet (TPWD 2018a).

2.2

Wright Patman Lake

The Wright Patman Lake parcels encompass both the Tertiary Uplands and the Floodplains and
Low Terraces subregions of the South-Central Plains ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007), which is also
part of the “Piney Woods” ecological area defined by Gould (1975). Situated at the western edge
of the southern coniferous forest belt, this ecoregion is characterized by irregular plains blanketed
by pine (Pinus spp.), medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous, hardwood, and swamp forests
(Perttula 2004). However, much of the South-Central Plains ecoregion has been altered through
timber harvests and commercial pine plantations consisting of loblolly and shortleaf pine. In
addition, approximately one-sixth of the region, specifically within the Red River floodplain, is
utilized as cropland.

2.2.1

Physiography

Encompassing 11,607 square miles, the Tertiary Uplands subregion covers areas of east Texas,
southern Arkansas, and northern Louisiana. With elevations ranging from 180 to 750 feet AMSL,
the subregion is characterized by “dissected irregular plains with some low, rolling hills [bisected
by] low to moderate gradient streams” (Griffith et al. 2007: 88). On the other hand, the Floodplains
and Low Terraces subregion is much smaller, covering only 1,357 square miles and encompassing
sections of the Sulphur River, Big Cypress Bayou, Sabine River, Angelina River, Neches River,
and Trinity River. This subregion is described as “nearly level floodplains [with] associated low
terraces and low gradient streams” (Griffith et al. 2007: 89). Elevation across the Floodplains and
Low Terraces subregion ranges from 5 to 330 feet AMSL.
2.2.2

Climate

The climate within these subregions is described as subtropical with hot, usually humid, and wet
summers with mild to cool winters (Peel et al. 2007). Annually, Wright Patman Lake receives
approximately 40 to 46 inches of precipitation, with maximum rainfall occurring in the spring and
fall seasons (USDA-NRCS 2018; Perttula 2004). The same area has a mean annual air temperature
of 65 °F. Over the last 1,000 years, the region’s climate has fluctuated through wet and dry periods.
Some of the most devastating droughts occurred in the late A.D. 1200s, and again in the mid1400s, 1600s, and 1700s (Stahle and Cleaveland 1994, 1995).
2.2.3

Geology and Soils

The parcels at Wright Patman Lake are underlain by the Tertiary-aged Wilcox group, Undivided
(Ewi), Fluvatile terrace deposits (Qt), and Quaternary-aged alluvium (Qal). The Wilcox group,
undivided consists of sandy, lignitiferous, littoral clays that are cross-bedded with river sands,
compact non-calcareous clays, and stratified deltaic silts. The basal beds of this formation “mark
the transition from marine muds and silts of the underlying Wills Point Formation to coarser,
littoral, deltaic, and non-marine deposits of the Wilcox [group]” (Sellards et al. 1990:573). This
formation has a thickness of 1,260 feet.
According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), the Wright Patman Lake parcels consist
of 12 named soil groups (see Chapter 1.3.2). Generally, these soils are characterized by fine
sandy loam surface textures with loam to clayey subsoils that range from poorly to well-drained
(USDA-NRCS 2018).
Soils associated with the Tertiary Uplands and Floodplains and Low Terraces subregions are
characterized by well-drained Ultisols and Alfisols. In general, Ultisols, or weathered soils formed
in humid areas, are characterized by a “light colored sandy to loamy surface layer and a more
clayey subsoil” (Story 1990:9). These soils support a hardwood and pine forest, are acidic, and
tend to be moist throughout most of the year, which results in the poor preservation of human and
faunal remains (Story 1990). On the other hand, Alfisols are moderately leached soils that formed
under a forest overstory. These soils are defined by a mostly light-colored (gray to brown), thin
and loamy A-horizon, and a more clayey and alkaline B-horizon (Story 1990). Alfisols support
tall grasses to hardwoods.

2.2.4

Biota

Forested areas of the Tertiary Uplands subregion include mature pine and pine-hardwood stands
consisting of loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, southern red oak (Quercus falcate), post oak (Quercus
stellata), white oak (Quercus alba), hickory (Carya tomentosa), and sweetgum (Liquidambar
styraciflua). The forested areas are intermixed with an understory of American beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana), sumac (Rhus spp.), greenbrier (Smilax spp.), and hawthorn (Crataegus
spp.) (Griffith et al. 2007). Lastly, medium to tall grasses such as yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum
nutans), pinehill bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium var. divergens), narrowleaf woodoats
(Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), and panicums (Panicum spp.) blanket the subregion (Griffith et al.
2007; Gould 1978).
The Floodplains and Low Terraces “comprise the western margin of the southern bottomland
hardwood communities that extend along the Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains from Texas to
Virginia” (Griffith et al. 2007: 88). Vegetation found within the bottomland oaks (Quercus spp.)
and gum (Nyssa spp.) forest include water oak (Quercus nigra), willow oak (Quercus phellos),
sweetgum, blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), elm (Ulmus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), southern red
oak, swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii), and loblolly pine. The understory consists of holly,
grape (Vitis spp.), poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), crossvine (Bignonia capreolata), and
greenbrier. In seasonally flooded areas, overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), water hickory (Carya
aquatic), water elm (Planera aquatic), sweetgum, green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and red
maple are prevalent, while bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatic)
occur in semi-permanently flooded parts of this subregion. Lastly, black willow (Salix nigra),
sycamore (Plantanus americana), and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) can be found along
riverbanks (Griffith et al. 2007). At the lake, aquatic vegetation, which covers 10 percent of the
lake’s total surface, consists of chara (Chara spp.), American lotus, and buttonbush (Cephalanthus
occidentalis) (TPWD 2018b).
Wildlife species common to the area include whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red fox
(Vulpes vulpes), bobcat (Felix rufus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), nutria (Myocastor
coypus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), and mink (Mustela vison) (Davis and Schmidly 1994).
Lake habitats support a variety of turtles (Testudines spp.), frogs (Anura spp.), and snakes
(Serpentes spp.), such as the cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) and coachwhip (Masticophis
flagellum), as well as fish including largemouth bass, flathead (Pylodictis olivaris) and channel
(Ictalurus punctatus) catfish, white bass, white (Pomoxis annularis) and black (Pomoxis
nigromaculatus) crappie, and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) (Thomas et al. 2007). Bird species
include the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), bald eagle (Haliaeetus
leucocephalus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), mourning dove
(Zenaida macroura), white pelican (Elecanus erythrorhynchos), common loon (Gavia immer),
heron (Ardea spp.) and egret (Egretta spp.) (Bull and Farrand 1996).

2.2.5

Hydrology

Located approximately 11 miles southwest of the City of Texarkana and encompassing portions
of Bowie, Cass, Red River, Titus, and Morris counties, Texas, Wright Patman Lake serves as flood
control (flood pool elevation of 259.5 feet NGVD29) and water conservation for neighboring
communities. Authorized as part of the United States’ Flood Control Act of 1946, the lake was
formed by the impounding of the Sulphur River, as well as several smaller creeks. The Sulphur
River, which serves as Wright Patman Lake’s primary source of water, is formed by the joining of
the North and South Sulphur rivers. The Sulphur River crosses generally flat terrain composed of
sandy loams and clay, which supports hardwoods, conifers, and various grasses (HTO 2018).
Totaling 183 miles in length, the Sulphur River is dammed 6 miles to the southeast of Redwater,
Texas. After exiting the lake, the river flows into Arkansas, where it empties into the Red River.
The dam was constructed between 1948 and 1957. Initially known as the “Texarkana Reservoir”,
the lake was renamed in the late 1970s in honor of East Texas Congressman John William Wright
Patman (Breeding 2018). Elevation of the conservation pool varies seasonally, with a winter
conservation pool level of 220.4 feet NGVD29, and a summer level of 227.5 feet NGVD29.
During the summer, the lake can encompass approximately 33,750 acres, while in the winter the
normal conservation pool area is 20,300 acres. Wright Patman Lake has a maximum depth of 40
feet (TPWD 2018b).

Previous Investigations

Background research for this project included an online records search through the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas 2018) and a review of historic
maps and aerial photographs. Research focused on the identification of previously conducted
surveys and previously recorded archeological sites, sites listed on the NRHP, Registered Texas
Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), and historic
cemeteries located within each parcel. Previous professional investigations included the early
Smithsonian Institution River Basin surveys of the 1940s, a 1970 USACE survey, a 1970 USACE
linear survey, and a 2014 SEARCH survey of selected archeological sites around Wright Patman
Lake. However, none of the parcels have been thoroughly investigated using contemporary
archeological methods.
Sixteen (16) previously recorded archeological sites (41CS103-111, 41CS116-118, 41NA131,
41SA96, 41SA128, and 41SA137) are plotted within the APE. All of these sites were revisited
during the current investigation.

3.2

Cultural Historical Framework

The Sam Rayburn Reservoir is situated within the Deep East Texas archeological region, while
Wright Patman Lake is in the Red River archeological region (Perttula 2004). Human occupation
within these regions can be divided into two stages: (1) Prehistoric, and (2) Historic.
3.2.1

Prehistoric Period

The Prehistoric stage has been further divided into the following periods:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)

Paleoindian Period (13,000-10,500 years Before Present [BP]);
Archaic Period (10,000-2500 BP);
Woodland/Early Ceramic Period (2500-1150 BP)
Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo Periods (AD 800-1400); and
Late Caddo Period (AD 1200-1680).

Paleoindian Period
Buried and intact Paleoindian-period sites are rare in Northeast Texas. In fact, most of the
archeological record for this period “consists of surficial, mixed, or isolated finds of temporally
diagnostic projectile points” (Perttula 2004:373). Diagnostic artifacts associated with the Early
Paleoindian Period (ca. 13,000-10,500 BP) include Clovis and Folsom projectile points typically
made from high-quality, non-local, lithic raw materials. Late Paleoindian Period (10,500-10,000
BP) diagnostic tools include the Dalton, Plainview, San Patrice, Scottsbluff, and early side-notched
points. Additional tools associated with the Paleoindian Period include Albany beveled bifaces,
Quince-style bifacial scrapers, and bifacial adzes (Perttula 2004).

April 2019

Page 21

Cultural Context

Archeologists have suggested that Paleoindians in North America formed highly mobile hunting
and gathering bands, hunting megafauna and a wide variety of other animal and plant resources.
However, little to no evidence exists that supports the hunting of megafauna by Paleoindian
peoples in East Texas. Based on archeological evidence in these regions, Paleoindians preferred
to settle near major drainages, in resource-rich areas, on alluvial terraces, and on upland
projections. A few of the better-known Paleoindian-period sites within Northeast Texas include
the Wolfshead site (Duffield 1963) and the Forrest Murphey site (Perttula 2004).
Archaic Period
The beginning of the Archaic Period, or the Early Archaic sub-period (ca. 10,000-8000 BP),
experienced the onset of drier and much warmer climatic conditions than those present during the
Paleoindian Period (Story 1990). As a result, people remained highly mobile, utilizing both
“heavy” and “limited-use” areas near larger drainage basins (Thurmond 1990). Additionally,
subsistence strategies were broadened to include the exploitation of resources such as acorns,
fruits, rodents, and deer (Story 1985). Early Archaic sites appear to have been repeatedly, but
briefly, occupied by small groups of people. Lithic technology consisted of expedient tools and
projectile points with straight and expanding stem forms, as well as Pelican, Graham Cave, and
Rice Lobed projectile points (Perttula 2004).
During the Middle Archaic sub-period (8000-4500 BP), the aboriginal inhabitants continued to
extensively utilize and occupy major basins within the region. However, smaller tributaries and
headwaters were also occupied, but with less frequency. While archeological sites during the
Archaic Period saw an increase “in the number and types of functionally different tools,” this
became more evident during the Middle Archaic sub-period (Dockall and Fields 2006). For
example, during the Middle Archaic, the use of burned rock, ground stone tools, and polished stone
(e.g., grooved aces) increased, which implies a greater reliance on plant foods (e.g., hardwood
mast). Non-local, lithic raw materials continued to be traded and used for tool manufacture but
are uncommon during this sub-period (Perttula 2004). Projectile point types associated with the
Middle Archaic in East Texas include the Big Sandy, Calf Creek, Johnson, Carrollton, Morrill,
Evans, Lone Oak, Trinity, and Wesley types (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).
By the Late Archaic (4500-2500 BP), inhabitants occupied most of the region’s landforms,
including major streams, spring-fed branches, upland ridges, and tributary drainages of all sizes.
Like the Middle Archaic, burned rock features continued to be utilized, suggesting a continued
reliance on plant foods. Based on settlement data, populations during the Late Archaic increased
in size, group mobility diminished, and territorial ranges were established (Perttula 2004).
Diagnostic projectile point types common during this sub-period consist of the Lange, Castroville,
Ellis, Palmillas, Edgewood, Yarbrough, Ensor, and Kent types (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).
Woodland/Early Ceramic Period
The beginning of the Woodland Period (2500-1150 BP) is defined by the introduction of ceramics
into local archeological assemblages. Diagnostic tools indicative of this period include doublebitted chipped axe heads and Gary dart points, while small, expanding stem arrow points, such as
the Colbert, Friley, and Steiner point types, are thought to have appeared after AD 700 (1250 BP)
(Shafer and Walters 2010). Other characteristics of the Woodland culture includes the
April 2019

Page 22

A Cultural Resource Survey of 1,874 Acres at Sam Rayburn Reservoir and Wright Patman Lake, Texas

construction of burial mounds in some areas, and the cultivation of squash (Black 2003). However,
no Woodland-period burial mounds have been documented within the Piney Woods ecological
area.
Woodland inhabitants of Northeast Texas continued to practice a hunter-gatherer subsistence
strategy, occupied campsites for longer periods of time, and may have lived in larger groups than
previous periods (Dockall and Fields 2006). This is supported by the presence of structures and
substantial midden deposits in Woodland-period archeological sites such as the Dancing Snakes
site (41HO268) and the Herman Ballew site (41RK222) (Perttula 2015; Rogers et al. 2001).
Woodland-period sites are found on the floodplains or terraces of larger streams, with smaller
occupational components in the uplands and along smaller tributary streams. Differences among
Woodland-period artifact assemblages suggest variation in subsistence strategies, food processing,
and diet during this period (Perttula 2004; Skibo and Blinman 1999).
Three major regional Woodland-period ceramic traditions are recognized: (1) Fourche Maline, (2)
Mossy Grove, and (3) Mill Creek (Ellis 2013).
Fourche Maline – Sites associated with the Fourche Maline tradition are found in Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Northeast Texas. These large sites often consist of extensive midden
deposits containing burials. Cultural materials associated with the Fourche Maline “include Gary
dart points, seed grinding stones, boatstones, double-bitted axes, modeled clay platform pipes, and
Poole clay pipes” (Ellis 2013:139). Ceramics commonly found at Fourche Maline sites are
described as plain, or with simple decorations, and they consist of thick ceramic bowls and
‘flowerpot’ shaped jars with flat disc-shaped bases tempered with grog, crushed bone, “grit,” or
sand (Ellis 2013). In Texas, Fourche Maline sites are rare, but have been identified around the
Sulphur River basin and in the Red River basin. Sites in the Sulphur River basin include the
Arnold Site (41HP102) and the Snipes Site (41CS8).
Mossy Grove – Sites associated with the Mossy Grove culture are found in the upper Texas Gulf
Coast, southwestern Louisiana, and the southern portions of the Texas Piney Woods. Utilizing
ceramics with an untampered sandy paste, the Mossy Grove culture has thin, decorated ceramics
with narrow incised lines and punctations. Many of these ceramics are described as “sandy paste
wares with thin walls, floated surfaces, and rounded or conical-shaped bases” (Ellis 2013:141).
Differences in settlement and subsistence patterns, as well as technology, has led archeologists to
divide this tradition into two sub-areas: (1) the Coastal margins, and (2) the Inland Coastal Plain
(Ellis 2013). The inland subregion is characterized by a hunter-and-gatherer subsistence strategy,
with short-term occupation sites with plain sandy paste ceramics, Gary and Kent dart points, sparse
lithic scatters, and ground stone. Sites with Mossy Grove cultural components include the Jones
Hill Site (41PK8) and the Crawford Site (41PK69) (Ensor and Carlson 1988; McClurkan 1968),
as well as numerous sites at Sam Rayburn Reservoir (Jelks 1965, 2017).
Mill Creek – The third Woodland ceramic tradition identified by archeologists is the Mill Creek
culture, which began around 2450 BP (Ellis 2013). This ceramic tradition is highly variable in
temper and paste types, with wares including a sandy paste, bone temper, and grog temper. The

April 2019

Cultural Context

ceramic assemblages are typically undecorated; however, those with decorations often exhibit Ushaped incised lines. The variation found among Mill Creek sites, such as the Hatley Creek Site
(41HS74) (Dockall et al. 2008) and the Holmes Site (41MS282) (Walters and Perttula 2010) hints
at a “blending of distinct ceramic traditions” (Ellis 2013:144).
Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo Periods
Around AD 800-900 (1150-1050 BP), this region emerged as a central part of the Caddo area,
occupied by Caddo Indian peoples whose distinctive culture was characterized by complex
political systems and social hierarchies, a reliance on cultivated plants, the construction and use of
temples and burial mounds, as well as well-crafted ceramics frequently bearing elaborate
decorations. Caddo culture was marked by small farming or horticultural villages and hamlets
organized around larger ceremonial centers and villages. The small, permanently occupied
hamlets or individual farmsteads were typically found along “elevated landforms, adjacent to
major streams, in stream valleys, and along minor tributaries and spring fed branches” (Perttula
2004:379), while the larger ceremonial centers were situated along major waterways such as White
Oak Creek, Big Cypress Creek, or the Red, Sulphur, and Sabine rivers. The hamlets and
farmsteads are often characterized by rectangular and/or circular structures with associated
cemeteries. These large villages were common during the Early and Middle Caddo periods.
Caddo groups during this period were horticulturalists, cultivating crops such as maize and squash.
However, maize did not become a staple food until sometime around AD 1300 (650 BP) (Perttula
2004). The reliance on cultivated food resulted in settlements located in areas containing fertile
soils and good drainage. In addition to the crops listed above, Caddo groups also hunted wild
game and collected plant foods, including wild nuts and tubers.
The material culture produced by Early and Middle Caddo peoples is characterized by cornernotched and rectangular stemmed arrow points, such as the Alba, Bonham, and Catahoula types,
as well as ceramic pipes (e.g., long-stemmed Red River pipe), cigar-shaped platform pipes, stone
and ceramic ear spools, and celts. The most notable material culture produced by Caddo groups
are ceramic fine and utility wares, which consist of different types of bowls, jars, and bottles with
a variety of decorative methods and elements, including incised, punctated, appliqued, engraved,
and slipped (Perttula 2013). Ceramics associated with the Formative and Early Caddo periods
include Hickory Fine Engraved, Carmel Engraved, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, and Pennington
Punctated-Incised (Hunt and Cliff 1998). Middle Caddo-period types include Sanders Engraved,
Bois’ d’Arc Plain, Sanders Slipped, Pease Brushed-Incised, Antioch Engraved, Nacogdoches
Engraved, Canton Incised, Maxey Noded Redware, Washington Square Punctated, and Reavely
Brushed-Incised.
Late Caddo Period
During this period, rural communities, which were commonly located near secondary streams,
were widely distributed across the region, and Caddo “towns,” often found along major stream
valleys, constructed mounds and/or large community cemeteries where both elite and non-elite
Caddo peoples lived and were buried. A decrease in the frequency of lithic tools and debris

suggests that wood and bone tool industries, which likely flourished during all periods, increased
during the Late Caddo period (Perttula 2004). However, due to poor organic preservation in East
Texas, evidence for bone and wood tools is limited.
Interregional exchange was also prominent during this period. Late Caddo-period earthen mounds
were constructed and primarily used during the early part of the period (from AD 1400-1540 [550410 BP]), except around the Red River, where mound construction continued until ca. AD 1700
(250 BP) (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). The Late Caddo Period has been divided into multiple
phases, which are directly correlated with a specific region. The Texarkana phase is associated
with sites along the Lower Sulphur River, and those on the Red River, north of Wright Patman
Lake, while the Angelina phase encompasses the Sam Rayburn Reservoir area.
Texarkana Phase – Dating from approximately AD 1300-1680 (650-270 BP), the Texarkana phase
is characterized by farmsteads, hamlets, and large villages associated with earthen mounds and
cemeteries (Dockall and Fields 2006). These large and permanent settlements reflect sedentary
and agricultural communities with complex societies that were likely governed by high status
individuals (Black 2003). Well-known Texarkana-phase sites include the Eli Moore (41BW2) and
Cabe Mounds sites (41BW14) (Perttula et al. 1995; Perttula 2015).
Angelina Phase – The Angelina phase dates from ca. AD 1200-1680 (750-270 BP) and is broken
into the early (ca. AD 1200-1400/1450 [750-550/500 BP]) and late (ca. AD 1400/1450-1680
[550/500-270 BP]) phases (Perttula and Walters 2016a). These subdivisions are characterized by
the frequency of brushed versus incised-punctated sherds in local assemblages. Tom Middlebrook
(1994) identified more incised-punctated sherds than brushed sherds at early Angelina-phase sites,
and the inverse at late Angelina-phase sites. Other artifacts commonly found at these sites include
elbow and platform ceramic pipe fragments, which comprise almost half of the ceramic pipe
collections in late Angelina-phase sites (Perttula and Walters 2016b). Good preservation at these
sites has led to the recovery of numerous bone tools. At the Walter Bell Site (41SB50) in Sabine
County, Texas, archeologists recovered antler tine flakers, antler beam handles, a bird bone needle,
and a turtle shell rattle (Perttula and Walters 2016c). According to Jelks (1965), Perdiz arrow
points and a semi-flexed burial position indicate Angelina-focus affiliations. Additional Angelinaphase sites include the Jonas Short (41SA101) and the Wylie Price (41SA94) sites.
3.2.2

Historic Period

Historic Caddo Period
The Historic Caddo Period of Northeast Texas (ca. AD 1680–1840 [270-110 BP]) marks the arrival
of Europeans and Anglo-Americans into the region. It is during this period that the Caddo and all
other American Indian groups, except for the Alabama-Coushatta, were relocated from Texas to
the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddo settlements in the region were small farmsteads and
hamlets, with associated household cemeteries. In areas not abandoned during this period,
communities were composed of numerous farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts
recovered from Historic Caddo-period sites include a wide variety of Caddo ceramics, basketry,
and ornaments, as well as bone and stone tools such as Jowell Knives (Cole 1975). European
goods are commonly found on Historic Caddo-period sites dating after ca. AD 1720 (230 BP).

These artifacts include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles, hatchets,
knives, hoes, lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
European Exploration and the Historic Period
Area of Sam Rayburn Reservoir – The area around the Angelina and Neches rivers was reinhabited by Antonio Gil Ibarvo and his fellow settlers in 1779 at the location of the previously
abandoned mission in the Nacogdoches area. The Spanish also settled areas to the southeast of
Nacogdoches along the Angelina River, called the “Ayish Bayou District”, in the late eighteenth
century. Shortly after Nacogdoches’ founding, Ibarvo built a building later called the “Old Stone
Fort” for business and administration, and the settlement became a center for illegal trade between
Spanish, French, and Americans (Long 2018; McDonald 1981). Throughout the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, Nacogdoches was the central location of politics in East Texas. Joaquín de
Arredondo sacked the town around 1812 for housing supporters of Augustus Magee and Bernardo
Guitiérrez. It became the stage for a battle in 1832 that helped instigate the Texas Revolution, as
well as the center of the Córdova Uprising in 1838 (McDonald 1981).
San Augustine, the only other densely-inhabited area during this time, also participated heavily in
political activities and conflicts (Crocket 1932). Although the region was constantly contested in
the 1820s and 1830s, Anglo-American settlers continued to come and set up farms in what would
become Nacogdoches, Angelina, San Augustine, Tyler, and Jasper counties. Bevil’s Settlement,
later called “Jasper”, was founded in 1824 by John Bevil; in 1844, it became the county seat of
Jasper County (Smith 1979). The first ferry and port town in the area, Town Bluff, was settled on
the Neches River in 1833 as part of Lorenzo de Zavala’s colony. Woodville was established in
1846 when Tyler County was formed, and quickly established itself as the county seat.
By 1844, after the Regulator-Moderator War in the east, most of the area had seen the last of
openly-violent conflict (McCroskey 2018). However, a new conflict was brewing that eventually
erupted into the Civil War. Mostly Southerners, who carried the slave-run plantation culture with
them, settled the region. Unlike their neighbors to the north, much of the environment was not
conducive to cotton production, so many who remained in the area were poor farmers with few or
no slaves, relying on subsistence agriculture, corn, and hogs, as well as some tobacco, rice, and
cattle. Steamboats ferried corn, cotton, and other products down the Angelina River and other
navigable rivers to markets in the east, and many towns derived their income from port fees. As a
result, the reaction of the region’s inhabitants to secession was mixed. The Mexican population in
Nacogdoches did not approve of secession, but the area eventually voted to support the cause
(Long 2018). Angelina County was one of the few counties in the state to reject secession
altogether (Boon 1937). The other counties to the south and east stuck to their Southern roots and
supported the action, sometimes by an overwhelming margin.
Once the Civil War began, all the inhabitants of the region supported the Confederate Army,
supplying troops and some iron goods. San Augustine was occupied by Confederate troops to
guard against invasion, but no battles were fought in the area.

Nacogdoches, Woodville, and Jasper counties were occupied by Union troops during
Reconstruction, and some Ku-Klux-Klan (KKK)-like organizations were formed to force AfricanAmerican activists out of the area. However, these organizations dissolved soon after they were
created. The region suffered economically after the Civil War and did not begin to recover until
the railroads were built in the 1880s. All but San Augustine County had railroads built by the end
of the nineteenth century, and this mode of transportation enabled lumbering to be developed in
full force. Towns such as Colmesneil, Rockland, Browndell, Zavalla, and Broaddus sprung up
around new sawmills, and existing towns began to harvest nearby timber for a new source of
income (St. Clair and St. Clair 1982; Wooster 2018). However, poor timber renewal practices and
The Depression caused timber sales to plummet in the 1930s, and several small towns were
deserted. In most areas, raising livestock began to replace what little cotton production was
present, and modest oil extraction was developed to support the economy in Nacogdoches and
Jasper counties. However, the primary economy remained agricultural, and the people maintained
a steady, rural lifestyle. Timber harvesting was revived during and after World War II, but not to
the extent of previous years. Other areas began planting sugar cane, raising poultry, and
manufacturing tung (to make lacquer). The Sam Rayburn Reservoir was completed in 1965, and
tourism helped to revive the regional economy.
Area of Lake Wright Patman – The first European expedition into the area near Wright Patman
Lake was led by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de
Soto expedition into the southeastern United States and took over the entrada after de Soto’s death
in 1539. Looking for an overland route back to New Spain, he crossed into the territory that
became Bowie County, and used existing trails established by the Caddo to move further into the
interior of Texas before turning around and traveling back to the coast by way of the Mississippi
River (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993).
Later, French visitors to the area included Henri Joutel, who was part of the La Salle expedition,
and Henri de Tonti, who went to the area looking for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2018a).
In 1719, the French established Le Poste des Cadodaquious at a location just to the northwest of
Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as a trading station and supply
base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years after the French ceded Louisiana
to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish, under the name San Luiz de
los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni Caddo, with whom they were trying to foster a relationship, left
the area soon after (Britton 2018).
The United States first explored the area in 1806, when the Red River Expedition, launched by
Thomas Jefferson, traveled up the Red River to Spanish Bluff, where they were forced to turn back
by Spanish soldiers. Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass
counties began in the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee,
Delaware, and Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the American Indian tribes moved on within 10
years.

Cultural Context

In the early 1830s, Mark Epperson built a ferry to cross the Sulphur River, and the Republic of
Texas granted Epperson a half league at the spot. The crossing became part of Trammel’s Trace,
a horse path (and later wagon trail) from Nacogdoches to the Southwest Trail at Fulton, Arkansas
(Pinkerton 2016; Pirtle 2017). Epperson’s Ferry was one of two crossings of the Sulphur River.
In 1837, the postmaster was instructed to institute mail service from Nacogdoches to Epperson’s
Ferry, and on to the Red River county seat. Eventually, a settlement grew up around the ferry,
which served the growing number of settlers to the area. The ferry was replaced by two bridges,
the last in 1924 (Harper 2018d).
By 1846, separate counties had been established and county lines had been resolved. White settlers
were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton plantations, grew corn, and raised
hogs and cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave population outnumbered the white population
in Bowie County and numbered just under half in Cass County (Harper 2018a, 2017b). As was
expected, the white population strongly supported the secession movement and the Confederate
war effort. Although no battles took place in the area, federal troops occupied Bowie County in
1867 on behalf of the Freedmen’s Bureau to assist black residents in obtaining their legal and
political equality. This angered white residents, who had lost much of their capital once the slaves
were freed, and secretly supported anti-black movements such as Cullen Baker’s gang and the
KKK (Harper 2018b).
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up in the
area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village and where two
major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the largest
trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was founded in
1871 and it, along with Douglassville, became an economic center for the surrounding rural
community (Hazlewood 2018; Harper 2018c).
The area has remained rural, supported by an agricultural economy that is supplemented by small
manufacturing. The Depression had a devastating effect on the region, but World War II brought
the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant, which
employed many of the residents (Harper 2018b). Changes in the economic market drew people
away from farming and into manufacturing and trade. However, populations grew slowly, if at
all, and the inhabitants have remained relatively poor (Harper 2018b).

Chapter 4 – Methodology
4.1

Sample Stratification

For each parcel, a survey plan was prepared prior to fieldwork using topographic maps, the Atlas
(2018), and historic aerial photographs and maps. This plan involved identifying areas of higher
site probability within each parcel. Higher probability areas included knolls, ridges, stream
terraces, and other elevated landforms in proximity to naturally-occurring water, as well as areas
near previously-recorded archeological sites or where historic-age occupation was identified on
historic maps and aerial photographs. Low-lying areas, slopes, or areas that have been heavily
disturbed were deemed as having lower archeological potential. The spatial distribution of these
areas is depicted in Appendix A.
This stratification scheme resulted in 708 acres, or approximately 37 percent, of the total APE
being classified as having higher potential for containing archeological sites. The remaining 1,166
acres, or 63 percent, of the total APE was considered to have lower archeological potential (Table
4-1).

Survey Tactics

Archeologists conducted a 100-percent pedestrian survey of each parcel. Each archeologist
followed their own transect, generally walking parallel with other crew members. While walking
transects, archeologists were directed to emphasize shovel testing within the high probability areas
rather than at regular, periodic, intervals along each transect. These areas were delineated on the
display of each GPS unit and, as described above, consisted generally of elevated landforms or
along the edges of stream terraces overlooking waterways where alluvial and developed soils were
present. High probability areas were also delineated around the 16 previously-recorded sites
located within the APE.
As a result, shovel testing was not uniform across any of the parcels. Most shovel tests were
excavated within the previously-defined higher probability areas and significantly fewer shovel
tests were dug in the lower probability areas. This tactic has proved successful during recent
April 2019

Page 29

Methodology

PCI/AmaTerra surveys at these reservoirs (Sitters 2017, Bentley et al. 2017, Sitters and Perttula
2018). In fact, the change in survey tactics from non-stratified and systematic to stratified and
non-systematic resulted in an increase in the rate of positive shovel tests from 5.5 percent to 13.4
percent, or by more than a factor of two. This change also resulted in an increase in the discovery
of new sites from 1 new site per 128 acres (or 5 sites per square mile) to 1 new site per 51 acres
(12.5 sites per square mile), also an increase by a factor greater than two.
4.2.1

Shovel Testing

Shovel tests measured approximately 30 centimeters in diameter and extended to a maximum
depth of 100 cmbs or until encountering sterile deposits and restrictive features, such as basal clay
or the water table. The shovel tests were excavated in arbitrary levels not exceeding 20 centimeters
in thickness, and all soil was screened through quarter-inch hardware cloth. Shovel test data,
including depth, color, and soil texture, was recorded on standardized forms. Archeologists used
Garmin GPSMap64 GPS devices to record all shovel test locations, as well as to help in navigation.
In some cases, pedestrian survey and shovel testing could not be accomplished due to standing
water, which was documented through field notes and photographs. All shovel tests were flagged
using biodegradable flagging tape.
The distribution of positive shovel tests was further delineated by excavating additional shovel
tests in every direction where cultural-bearing deposits were believed to exist (e.g., high spots or
alluvial terraces), or until a project area boundary or physical hindrance was encountered, such as
water, a low-lying area with a clay surface texture, or a steep slope. All diagnostic prehistoricand historic-age cultural material recovered from shovel tests was collected and will be curated at
TARL in Austin, Texas. A sample of non-diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., lithic debitage) was
collected from the surface. All shovel tests were immediately backfilled after recording.
At each of the previously-recorded sites, sufficient shovel tests were excavated to confirm or reject
the presence of the site. All shovel tests were excavated on property owned by the USACE and
within the four target parcels.
4.2.2

Site Recording

For this survey, archeological sites were defined by loci containing artifacts or features older than
50 years of age and meeting at least one of the following criteria:
1)
2)
3)
4)

Five or more surface artifacts within a 15-meter radius; and/or
A cultural feature on the surface or exposed during shovel testing; and/or
A single shovel test containing at least five artifacts; and/or
Two positive shovel tests within 30 meters of each other, both containing either
prehistoric OR historic artifacts..

At each site, a permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch galvanized iron nail fixed
with an aluminum survey tag. Tags were embossed with: “AmaTerra Environmental, Inc., 139056, FS#” where “139-056” was the contractor project number, “FS” designated Field Site, and
“#” represented the temporary site number for newly-recorded sites.

Delineating Site Boundaries
Upon identification of a site according to one or more of the four criteria outlined above, multiple
additional shovel tests were excavated on the landform at semi-regular intervals to: (a) achieve
fairly even coverage, and (b) to identify site boundaries. Site boundaries were delineated,
generally on a single landform, based on positive shovel tests and observed features (if any). This
minimal definition was expanded occasionally to include surface artifacts which were thought to
be eroding downslope from intact deposits (see for example 41CS110, 41CS397), or where no
intact deposits could be identified (see for example, 41CS382). In some cases, a grouping of
positive shovel tests was separated from a scatter of surface artifacts by multiple negative tests
(see for example, 41CS107) if the assemblages appeared to be related, rather than defining two
different sites. Site boundaries were also delineated up to and not past the USACE property lines
(see for example, 41NA131), except where the site boundary was previously defined (see
41SA128), or in one case in error when shovel tests were erroneously dug outside the USACE
project area (41CS383).
Delineating Site Boundaries near the APE Boundary
No attempt was made to investigate any site outside of the USACE project limits. However, the
USACE property boundary was not clearly marked on the ground and in a few cases, some tests
were unintentionally excavated outside the project limits (for example, see site 41CS383). These
cases are described in the site narratives in Chapters 5 and 6; site management recommendations
in these cases are explicitly restricted to the portion of the site on USACE lands.
All site boundaries as depicted in site maps and as documented in site forms have been delineated
up to and not past the USACE property boundary. In a few cases, site boundaries may appear to
extend downslope into the lake when plotted on USGS topographic maps and/or on aerial imagery
(for example see site 41CS376). In these cases, the GPS plotting of the shovel tests and the
resulting site boundary should be assumed to be correct.
Similarly, in a few cases, the shapefile provided to AmaTerra showing the APE limits had been
(we assume) imprecisely digitized along the shoreline so that portions of the shoreline appear to
be outside the APE (for example, see sites 41CS104, 41CS399). We have not attempted to edit the
APE shapefiles to be congruent with the actual shoreline. In these cases, it should be assumed that
all shoreline portions of a site are genuinely on USACE lands and within the APE.
4.2.3

Shovel Testing Intensity

Field methods exceeded those specified by the USACE (2014), which directed that, at a minimum,
one shovel test be excavated for every three acres (equivalent to 0.33 test per acre). Using this
guideline, a minimum of 624 shovel tests were required to inventory the 1,874 acres. During this
survey, archeologists excavated a total of 2,238 shovel tests, an overall shovel testing intensity of
1.19 shovel tests per acre, or more than three times the contract requirement.
4.2.4

Lithic and Ceramic Artifact Analysis

Analysis of the lithic artifacts recovered during this project was conducted following the
conclusion of fieldwork. Artifact categories included abrading stone, bifaces, biface fragments,
drill, fire-cracked rock (FCR), flake cores, ground stone (mano, metate, and pitted stone), modified

April 2019

Methodology

flake tools, perforator, projectile points (arrow and dart), shaft straightener, and tested pebbles.
Projectile points were identified by morphological types using descriptions in Turner et. al (2011).
The analysis of the ceramic sherds emphasizes the acquisition of information on the technological
and stylistic character of the sherds from the sites. Of interest is the manufacture and production
of ceramic vessels, as determined from the study of temper use, as well as the stylistic character
of the decorated sherds, with the goal of assessing the place and cultural affiliation of the pottery
made and used at these sites within the context of East Texas ancestral Caddo ceramic traditions
and practices.
In conducting the sherd analysis of these ceramic assemblages, all the sherds were examined at a
basic level of detail (sherd type, decorative method, element, and temper), allowing sufficient
information to be obtained from the assemblage as a whole to characterize its stylistic and
technological diversity. This approach provided the opportunity for the analysis of the three wares
in these particular assemblages (namely plain ware, utility ware, and fine ware), compared with
other ancestral Caddo assemblages in East Texas.
More specifically, the following attributes were employed in the analysis of the ceramic vessel
sherds from these sites, following the Council of Texas Archeologists’ Ceramics Protocol
Committee’s recommended approach to the study of ancestral Caddo ceramics as detailed by
Perttula (2010:29-30):
a) Temper, the deliberate and indeterminate materials found in the paste (Rice 1987:411),
including a variety of tempers (such as grog or crushed sherds, grit or crushed quartz
pebbles, and burned mussel shell) and “particulate matters of some size”;
b) Although most of the sherds were small and thus from indeterminate vessel forms, where
sherds were large enough, vessel form categories included open containers (bowls) and
restricted containers, including jars and bottles. Other form attributes included rim profile
(direct or vertical, and inverted) and lip profile (rounded, flat, or folded to the exterior).
The orifice diameter of sufficiently large rim sherds was also measured, as the orifice
diameters of vessels, used for cooking, food service, and the storage of food stuffs and
liquids, provided some indication of the scale of food preparation and food serving in a
Caddo vessel assemblage, and whether vessels were intended for individual or communal
use. In a few cases, base shape was also recorded.
With respect to interior and exterior surface treatment on the sherds, the primary methods of
finishing the surface of the vessels included smoothing, burnishing, and polishing. 1 Smoothing
created “a finer and more regular surface…[and] has a matte rather than a lustrous surface” (Rice
1987:138). Burnishing created an irregular lustrous finish, marked by parallel facets left by the
Brushing, a popular method of roughening the surface of post-AD 1200 Middle, Late, and Historic Caddo cooking
jars in East Texas with stiff bundles of grasses, is considered a decorative treatment rather than solely a functional
surface treatment (cf. Rice 1987:138). A roughened, textured, and brushed vessel would certainly have been easier
to pick up and carry than would an un-roughened or smoothed vessel. However, because the brushing was applied
to be an integral part of the decoration of both rim and body vessel surfaces, it is de-emphasized as a surface
treatment.

burnishing tool (perhaps a smoothed pebble or bone). A polished surface treatment is marked by
a uniform and highly lustrous surface finish, done when the vessel is dry, but without “the
pronounced parallel facets produced by burnishing leather-hard clay” (Rice 1987:138).
The stylistic analysis of Caddo ceramics from these sites focused on the definition of recognizable
decorative elements in the fine wares (i.e., the engraved and red-slipped vessels, including
carinated bowls and bottles) and utility wares, usually cooking or storage jars, and simple bowls.
These wares are known to have been made and used differently, based on functional, technological,
and stylistic analyses on numerous Caddo sherd assemblages in the broader East Texas region,
with uses ranging from food service, cooking of food stuffs, as containers for liquids, and for plant
food/seed crop storage. Sherd analysis included the documentation of the methods of decoration,
including the identification of motifs and elements.
The decorated sherds from the sites were readily separated into fine wares or utility wares,
following the distinctions discussed some years ago by Schambach and Miller (1984) at the Cedar
Grove Site in the Great Bend area in southwestern Arkansas, and by Perttula (2013) for East Texas
Caddo wares. These distinctions included apparent differences in temper, surface treatment, vessel
forms, and decorative methods. Utility wares generally are jars and simple bowls used for the
cooking and storage of foods, have a coarse temper, and lack burnishing, polishing, or slipping on
interior and exterior vessel sherd surfaces. Such vessel sherds are decorated with brushing,
incising, punctations (tool, cane, or fingernail), and appliqued elements, either by themselves or in
combination with one or more of these decorative methods (Perttula 2013; Schambach and Miller
1984; Suhm and Jelks 1962). Fine wares, on the other hand, at the sites consisted principally of
engraved vessel sherds from carinated bowls, some simple bowls, and bottles; none of the
engraved sherds in the collections from this project had a slip. The fine ware vessel sherds were
more frequently smoothed or burnished on the exterior vessel surface, and the fine ware vessels
from the Caddo sites seem to have been made, fired, and used in different ways than were the
utility ware vessels.
Decorative techniques present in the ceramic sherd collections from this archeological survey
included engraving in the fine wares, as opposed to incising, incising-punctated, punctated (both
fingernail and tool), brushing, brushed-appliqued, brushed-incised, brushed-punctated, and
appliqued, in the utility wares. Engraving was done with a sharp tool when the vessel was either
leather-hard or after it was fired. When slipped, the red, iron-rich, clay slip was applied to one or
both surfaces of a vessel immediately before firing. The clay slip was typically applied to the
vessel exterior or both surfaces, and then was burnished or polished after it was leather-hard or
dry; when the vessel was fired, it created a thin red slip. In other instances, a kaolin-rich clay (i.e.,
white pigment) or a hematite-rich clay (i.e., red pigment) was applied as a pigment to engraved
ceramic vessels.
The other decorative techniques—all in the utility wares—were executed with tools (incising and
punctations with wood, bone sticks, or dowels and brushing primarily with frayed sticks or grass
bundles), with finger impressions (fingernail punctated), or with the fingers forming the clay coils
into fillets and ridges (appliqued) when the vessel was wet or still plastic. The brushed-incised

decorative elements were probably created with a wood stick or dowel with attached grass bundles
or frayed sticks, so that when it was dragged across the wet surface of a vessel, it left both incised
and brushed lines and marks. In some cases, brushed marks on vessels were then overlain with
incised lines in opposed or parallel directions before the vessel dried.
4.2.5

Potential for Human Remains

Osteological material identified or suspected to be human was to be left in situ until confirmation
was made as to a non-human origin of the material by a qualified osteologist or forensic
anthropologist. If suspected or confirmed human remains were discovered during any portion of
this research, all excavations would cease in the immediate area of the remains and no further
disturbances to the area would occur until the appropriate points of contacts at the Piney Woods
Project Office were informed of the discoveries, and guidance was received on how to proceed.

4.3

Evaluation of Significance

The NHPA of 1966, as amended, (16 United States Code USC 470 et seq.) created the NRHP to
preserve and protect important aspects of our nation’s cultural heritage. Among other actions, the
NHPA directs federal agencies to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties
located on their land or controlled by them, and further stipulates that such agencies must consider
the effects of their actions on cultural resources. Pursuant to this direction, agencies are required
to locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all properties owned or under
their control that appear to qualify for nomination to the NRHP. Eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP is restricted to properties that are significant and possess integrity (emphasis added) as
defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §60.4:
“The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering
and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.”
Significance is further defined in four criteria. Cultural resources are considered significant if
they:
a) Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
b) Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose component may lack individual distinction; or
d) Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history (36
CFR §60.4).
Cultural resources may qualify for inclusion in the NRHP under any of the four evaluation criteria.
Methods developed prior to the current field work specified that prehistoric sites were to be
evaluated for significance with respect to the NHPA under Criterion D. The demonstrated data
content of each site was compared to important research contexts. Sites in good condition and

state of preservation, and having several data types bearing on one or more of the research contexts,
were evaluated as significant under Criterion D. Those sites that were observed to be in poor
condition or state of preservation and/or sites with no data types bearing on one or more of the
research contexts were evaluated as not significant. Finally, sites whose expression could not be
satisfactorily investigated using the survey methods employed during this archeological survey
were classified as being of unknown significance.
In addition to being evaluated under Criterion D as described above, Historic-period sites were
evaluated with respect to Criteria A, B, and C. Archival research was conducted to determine
whether any historic sites were associated with important historical events or persons. For this
project, none of the Historic-period sites retained architectural elements, and Criterion C was not
applied.

Chapter 5 – Results at Sam Rayburn Reservoir
This chapter presents the results of archeological field investigations of two parcels totaling 255
acres at Sam Rayburn Reservoir in Nacogdoches and San Augustine counties, Texas. A total of
371 shovel tests were excavated within the two parcels, a net rate of approximately 1.45 shovel
tests per acre. Of the shovel tests, 170 had cultural materials from the discovery and recording of
13 newly-documented archeological sites, 4 previously-recorded sites, and 2 Isolated Finds.
Appendix A provides maps depicting the locations of shovel tests and high probability areas by
parcel, while positive shovel test descriptions are presented by site in Appendix B.
Vegetation within the Sam Rayburn Reservoir parcels consisted of cypress, pine, and oak trees,
with a thick understory composed of grapevines (Vitis spp.), greenbrier, yaupon holly (Ilex
vomitoria), and wax myrtles (Figure 5-1). Unless specified otherwise, ground surface visibility
at the sites was poor (0-10 percent) due to leaf litter and pine duff. The water level was 166 feet
above the NGVD29 vertical datum at the time of survey.

Site 41NA131

Site 41NA131 is a previously-recorded, ancestral, Caddo occupation site with a historic
component (Figure 5-2). The site is located within the Attoyac Bayou parcel and consisted of a
series of artifact localities along a stream terrace that overlooked Attoyac Bayou to the east. These
localities were located on small sandy ridges separated by shallow, low-lying inundated areas.
Measuring 6.63 acres in size, elevation across the site area ranged from 166 to 170 feet AMSL.
The landform was underlain by Besner series fine sandy loam, with zero to one percent slopes,
and Mollville series loam (USDA-NRCS 2018). A typical positive shovel test consisted of
yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth: min=35 cmbs; max=110 cmbs) underlain by
yellowish-red (5YR 4/6) clay. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 110 cmbs.
Site 41NA131 was originally recorded in 1980 by Carey D. Weber (Atlas 2018). Weber described
the site as a small lithic scatter composed entirely of lithic debitage. Artifacts were observed to a
depth of 50 cmbs. Site dimensions were not provided, and no site perimeter is shown on the Atlas,
with only a centroid being plotted.
During the site revisit, investigators excavated 44 shovel tests along the stream terrace, of which
32 tested positive for cultural materials (73 percent ubiquity). Prehistoric artifacts included lithic
debitage (n=185), FCR, bifaces (n=3), and ceramic sherds (n=18). Artifacts were normally
distributed from the surface to 100 cmbs with a single mode at 20 to 40 cmbs (Table 5-1). Raw
materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools included jasper and petrified wood. Both
Woodland-period and ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from the site. The
Woodland-period ceramics included six Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified bottle sherds (Story
1990). The post-AD 800 ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds included a plain grog-tempered
body sherd, a plain grog-bone-tempered carinated bowl body sherd, and a parallel incised body
sherd from a bone-hematite-tempered jar.
Historic-period cultural materials consisted of one undecorated whiteware ceramic sherd, a shard
of colorless vessel glass, and two square nails (STs BN-645, BN-646, SM-461). Three of the four
historic items were recovered in the upper 20 cmbs, but the whiteware sherd was recovered from
40-60 cmbs (ST BN-645). All three of these shovel tests were clustered on the narrow ridgeline
extending into the lake.
Historic Research
Neither the 1953 USGS topographic map nor the 1940 highway map for Nacogdoches County
depict any structure at or near the location where the four historic artifacts were observed. A vacant
structure (possibly a barn) is depicted approximately 2,000 feet west of this location on the 1940
highway map but is well outside of the project boundary. The four artifacts on this site are
considered to be a scatter having no in situ context. Based on the types of artifacts recovered and
the results of the review of historic maps and aerial photographs, the historic component of Site
41NA131 is likely a late-nineteenth century to early twentieth century artifact scatter.

Site 41NA401

Site 41NA401 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of unknown age located on a linear high spot that
overlooks Attoyac Bayou to the east (Figure 5-3). Situated at 166 feet AMSL within the Attoyac
Bayou parcel, the site area measured 0.08 acre in size. The landform on which the site is located
was bound by two low-lying drainages to the north and south. According to the USDA-NRCS
(2018) Web Soil Survey, soils within the site area consist of the Besner series fine sandy loam.
Positive shovel tests placed within the site encountered yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam
(depth: min=40 cmbs; max: 60 cmbs) with pea-sized gravels underlain by clay. Shovel tests
terminated at a maximum depth of 63 cmbs after exposing clay.
Seven shovel tests were placed across the landform, four of which led to the recovery of cultural
materials (BN-624, BN-625, TH-455, and TH-456). The artifacts recovered from the site consisted
of lithic debitage (n=5) composed of petrified wood and one quartzite biface fragment. Two items
were recovered from 20-40 cmbs, and four items were recovered from 40-60 cmbs.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive
research potential because of limited archeological content and is considered not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Site 41NA402

Site 41NA402 is a Late Prehistoric occupation site measuring 1.15 acres in size (Figure 5-4).
Located on an alluvial terrace overlooking Attoyac Bayou to the east, the site covered a pointed
terrace bisected by a low-lying area that was saturated at the time of survey. The site is located
within the Attoyac Bayou parcel at an elevation of 166 to 168 feet AMSL. Soils consist of Attoyac
fine sandy loam with zero to four percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests containing
cultural material revealed a soil profile characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) and pale
brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam (depth: min=30 cmbs; max=51 cmbs) underlain by clay. Shovel
tests terminated upon reaching clay and extended to a maximum depth of 54 cmbs.
During investigations, 15 shovel tests were excavated around and within the site area. Eleven
shovel tests contained cultural materials (BN-629, BN-630, BN-631, BN-632, BN-633, BN-634,
BN-637, BN-638, HB-140, SM-454, and TH-468). The artifact assemblage consisted of lithic
debitage (n=14), a modified flake tool, and an expediently made arrow point (Figure 5-5) dating
to the Late Prehistoric period. Of the total items recovered on the subsurface, 10 were from the
upper 20 cmbs (including the projectile point from ST HB-140), four were from 20-40 cmbs, and
two items were from 40-54 cmbs. Jasper and petrified wood were used in the manufacturing of
lithic tools at the site.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances within the project area. The
site was not delineated outside the project boundary and may extend outside the project area to the
north. It lacks substantive research potential because of limited archeological content and is
considered not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP within the project area. No further work is
recommended within the project area.

Site 41NA403

Site 41NA403 is a 0.55-acre Woodland-period occupation site within the Attoyac Bayou parcel
and located on a crescent-shaped stream terrace that overlooked a tributary feeding into Attoyac
Bayou (Figure 5-6). Ranging in elevation from 166 to 170 feet AMSL, the landform sloped
steeply to the south. According to the USDA-NRCS (2018) Web Soil Survey, soils within the site
area are associated with Attoyac fine sandy loam (8 to 15 percent slopes). A typical positive shovel
test consisted of light yellowish-brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam and yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4)
sand (depth: min=30 cmbs; max=127 cmbs) underlain by yellowish-red (5YR 4/6) clay. Shovel
tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 127 cmbs.
Investigators excavated 11 shovel tests along the stream terrace, of which 9 tested positive for
cultural materials (BN-652, BN-653, HB-151, HB-152, HB-153, SM-467, TH-481, TH-482, and
TH-483). Artifacts included lithic debitage (n=48) and one sandy paste Goose Creek Plain, var.
unspecified body sherd. The sherd is evidence that the site was occupied at some point by Mossy
Grove culture peoples during the Woodland period (ca. 2500-1150 BP). Lithic raw materials
present in the assemblage included petrified wood and jasper. Artifacts were documented to a
maximum depth of 100 cmbs (Table 5-2).
NRHP Eligibility
This site contained intact and relatively undisturbed archeological deposits within the project area
and may have some research potential. Site 41NA403 was only delineated within the project
boundaries and may extend to the north. This site warrants test excavations to determine its NRHP
eligibility.

Site 41NA404

Site 41NA404 is a prehistoric lithic scatter measuring 0.05 acre in size (Figure 5-7) located within
the Attoyac Bayou parcel. The site was situated on a stream terrace, overlooking a tributary of
Attoyac Bayou to the east. The site sloped gradually from west to east, with an elevation range of
172 to 176 feet AMSL. The terrace was overlain by Sacul fine sandy loam with 5 to 20 percent
slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests placed within the site area encountered
yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light yellowish-brown (10YR 6/4), and
brownish-yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam (depth: min= 49 cmbs; max=100 cmbs) underlain by
yellowish-red (5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of 100 cmbs.
Five shovel tests were placed across the landform, four of which contained cultural material (BN680, HB-180, SM-491, and SM-492) (80 percent ubiquity). Recovered artifacts consisted of lithic
debitage (n=7) composed of chert, petrified wood, and jasper. Three artifacts were recovered in
the upper 20 cmbs, two from 20-40 cmbs, and two between 40-60 cmbs.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances within the project area. Site
41NA404 was not delineated outside the project boundary and may extend to the west. However,
within the project area, the site lacks substantive research potential because of limited
archeological content and is considered not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is

Site 41SA96

Site 41SA96 is a previously-recorded, ancestral Caddo occupation site with a possible Middle
Archaic component (Figure 5-8) located within the Ayish Bayou parcel. Located at the southern
end of a finger ridge, the site encompassed an area measuring 2.96 acres in size and ranged in
elevation from 164 to 172 feet AMSL. The landform currently forms a peninsula and is surrounded
by the waters of Sam Rayburn Reservoir to south, north, and east. Soils consist of Austonio fine
sandy loam (5 to 12 percent slopes) and the Metcalf-Sawtown complex (0 to 2 percent slopes)
(USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests containing cultural material revealed a soil profile
characterized by dark, yellowish-brown (10YR 3/4 & 4/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4), and brown (10YR 5/3) sand and sandy loams (depth: min=37 cmbs; max=105
cmbs) overlying yellowish-red (5YR 5/4) clay. Shovel tests reached a maximum depth of 105
cmbs.
According to the Atlas (2018), 41SA96 was originally recorded in 1940 as a village site by G.E.
Arnold. Arnold recorded ceramic sherds (n=314), projectile points (n=3), and petrified wood
artifacts (n=3) over an area measuring two acres in size. Site dimensions were not provided, and
no site perimeter is shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid being plotted. Arnold remarked that
“… portions of this sand hill are of a vari-colored soil, which is often indicative of a burial site or
mound”. He noted that no reports had yet been made of skeletal material at the site.
During current investigations, 35 shovel tests were excavated across the finger ridge and 28 of
these contained cultural materials (80 percent ubiquity). The artifact assemblage included lithic
debitage (n=103), a dart point that compares favorably to the Carrollton type (Figure 5-9), which
dates to the Middle Archaic period, and ceramic sherds (n=35). The lithic debitage was composed
of chert, jasper, petrified wood, and quartzite. Artifacts were recovered from depths ranging to
100 cmbs, normally distributed with a mode at 20-40 cmbs (Table 5-3); 81 percent of ceramic
sherds and 63 percent of lithic debitage were located between 0 and 40 cmbs.

Only 6.4 percent of the ceramic sherds were from Woodland-period Mossy Grove culture vessels.
These were from sandy paste Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified vessels. The remaining 93.6
percent of the sherds from 41SA96 were from ancestral Caddo vessels tempered with various
mixtures of grog, bone, and hematite (Table 5-4). The most common temper groups in the
assemblage were bone-tempered (31 percent of the ancestral Caddo sherds) and grog-tempered
(28 percent). Approximately 50 percent of the decorated sherds were from bone-tempered vessels.
More than 65 percent of the ancestral Caddo ceramic sherds had grog as a temper, 55 percent had
bone temper, and 24 percent had crushed hematite temper.

More than 87 percent of the decorated sherds from 41SA96 were from utility wares, and 43 percent
of the utility wares were from Bullard Brushed jars (Suhm and Jelks 1962) with brushed or
brushed-incised marks and lines (Table 5-5; Figure 5-10). The considerable proportion of sherds
from brushed jars in the assemblage suggests that the ancestral Caddo occupation took place after
ca. AD 1200, when brushed vessels began to be produced and used by Caddo peoples in East
Texas. It is most likely that the occupation at 41SA96 was after ca. AD 1400, during the Late
Caddo Period Angelina phase, when bone-tempered brushed vessels were common on ancestral
Caddo sites in the Neches and Angelina river basins in East Texas (Perttula 2013).

The one fine ware body sherd from 41SA96 was from a bone-tempered vessel of unknown ceramic
type. It had at least one horizontal engraved line and a vertical engraved bracket element (Table
5-2).
NRHP Eligibility
Overall, this site appears to have research potential and warrants protection and avoidance until
test excavations can be conducted to determine if it meets the criteria specified in 36 CFR Part
60.4 of the NRHP.

Site 41SA128

Site 41SA128 is a previously-recorded prehistoric archaeological site associated with the Archaic
and Woodland periods (Figure 5-11). The site is within the Ayish Bayou parcel on a high stream
terrace overlooking Ayish Bayou. With elevations ranging from 166 to 174 feet AMSL, the site
measured 0.07 acre in size. The terrace was overlain by Moswell loam with 5 to 15 percent slopes
(USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests placed within the site area encountered yellowishbrown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam to a maximum depth of 101 cmbs.
Site 41SA128 was originally recorded in 1959 by Bill Davis. According to the Atlas (2018), the
site is an Archaic site of less than one acre in size that contained three bifacial blades, an
unidentified dart point, a Wells dart point, a “Hayes-like” arrow point, a blade, a chopper, flake
cores, and lithic debitage. The artifact assemblage was recorded to a depth greater than one foot
below the surface. No mention is made of the Wood Cemetery (SA-C003), located immediately
to the east of the site on private property. The Wood Cemetery contains a reported 315 interments
from 1850 to the present (Atlas 2018). Although Davis described 41SA128 as “less than 1 acre,”
the site boundary on the Atlas contains approximately four acres and significantly overlaps the
cemetery. The site centroid is also plotted on private property north of the cemetery. The source
of this contradiction is unknown. It is possible that during transference of original map data into
the Atlas, Davis’s original site location was conflated with the location of the cemetery.
For current investigations, the landform and general area on USACE property were inspected
between the shoreline and the USACE property line and no artifacts were observed on the surface
except for a single sandy paste Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified body sherd. This sherd was
collected from the surface and was presumed to indicate the location of the site on the USACE
lands. A total of seven shovel tests were excavated within the site area on USACE property, only
one of which contained cultural materials. The positive shovel test (BN-721) recovered a lithic
flake composed of mottled gray and brown chert between 0 and 20 cmbs. No work was conducted
on any portion of the site on private property.
NRHP Eligibility
The portion of this site occurring on USACE property has poor contextual integrity and/or
evidence of disturbances. In this area, it lacks substantive research potential because of limited
archeological content. As a result, the portion of the site on USACE property is considered not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no further work is recommended.

Site 41SA137

Site 41SA137 is a previously-recorded, ancestral Caddo occupation site located at the southern
end of a finger ridge (Figure 5-12) within the Ayish Bayou parcel. The landform was bordered
by Couchatana Creek and Ayish Bayou. Measuring 2.16 acres in size, the site ranged in elevation
from 166 to 170 feet AMSL. The site was partially flooded at the time of survey. According to
the USDA-NRCS (2018) Web Soil Survey, soils within the site area are of the Alazan-Besner
complex, consisting of loam and sandy loam with zero to two percent slopes. Positive shovel tests
placed within the site area encountered yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth: min=40
cmbs; max=105 cmbs) underlain by yellowish-red (5YR 5/8) clay. Shovel tests terminated at a
maximum depth of 110 cmbs.
Site 41SA137 was originally recorded in 1979 by Carey D. Weber. Weber’s investigation of the
site reported “several dark gray and black san-tempered potsherds” across the surface. Site
dimensions were not provided, and no site perimeter is shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid
being plotted. The site description was based solely on surface observations. No eligibility
determination or recommendations were made at that time.
During current investigations, a total of 24 shovel tests were excavated across the finger ridge. Of
these, 19 tested positive for cultural materials (76 percent ubiquity). Artifacts included lithic
debitage (n=191), a tested cobble, FCR, a piece of unidentified fauna, a burned clay, and ceramic
sherds (n=17). Artifacts were broadly distributed vertically between the surface and 100 cmbs,
with a single mode at 20-40 cmbs (Table 5-6). Nearly 75 percent of all recovered artifacts were
from only four of the 19 positive tests (STs BN-694, BN-697, TH-522, TH-523), with two of these
containing material to 100 cmbs. Lithic raw materials present in the assemblage included jasper,
petrified wood, sandstone, and quartzite.

Woodland (n=4) and ancestral Caddo (n=13) ceramic vessel sherds were recovered at Site
41SA137. The Woodland-period sherds were from Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified vessels.
The ancestral Caddo vessel sherds included nine plain rim and body sherds, and four sherds from
grog-tempered brushed and brushed-incised vessels, likely from a post-AD 1400 Late Caddoperiod Angelina phase occupation. The vessels were tempered with grog (n=4), grog-bone (n=7),
bone (n=1), and bone-hematite (n=1). The high frequency of both brushed and bone-tempered
vessels at 41SA137 indicates the ceramic assemblage is part of the Late Caddo brushed-bonetempered ceramic horizon in the Neches and Angelina river basins in east Texas.
Features
A pit feature was encountered in Shovel Test TH-523. Here, lithic debitage (n=30) and ceramic
sherds (n=6) were recovered from a very dark, grayish-brown (10YR 3/2) soil, which was
significantly darker than the soils encountered in surrounding shovel tests. This dark soil
continued to a depth of 40 cmbs. Yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam was recorded directly
beneath this layer and continued to 110 cmbs. The yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) layer in Shovel
Test TH-523 contained lithic debitage (n=23) and a core/tested cobble.

5.9

Site 41SA349

Site 41SA349 is a prehistoric lithic scatter measuring 0.30 acre in size located within the Ayish
Bayou parcel. The site was situated at the western end of narrow spit and was surrounded on three
sides by the waters of Sam Rayburn Reservoir (Figure 5-13). With an elevation of 166 feet
AMSL, the landform was overlain by soils associated with the Alazan-Besner complex (zero to
two percent slopes) (USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests were characterized by yellowishbrown (10YR 5/4) and light, brownish-gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam (depth: min=20 cmbs;
max=100 cmbs). While basal clay was not encountered during shovel testing, investigators
encountered water and mud. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 100 cmbs.
Seven shovel tests were placed on the landform and all seven contained cultural materials (BN660, BN-661, BN-662, SM-475, SM-476, TH-490, and TH-491). Artifacts consisted solely of
lithic debitage (n=20) composed of jasper and petrified wood. Cultural material was broadly
distributed vertically, with 12 items from the upper 20 cmbs, three items from 20-40 cmbs, and
five items recovered between 40-60 cmbs.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive
research potential because of limited archeological content and is considered not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Site 41SA350

Site 41SA350 is a prehistoric lithic scatter within the Ayish Bayou parcel located on a stream
terrace overlooking the former Couchatana Creek stream course to the west (Figure 5-14).
Encompassing 0.15 acre in size, elevation was estimated to be 170 feet AMSL. Soils within the
site area are associated with the Alazan-Besner complex (zero to two percent slopes) soil unit
(USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests placed within the site area encountered yellowishbrown (10YR 5/4) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam (depth: min=70 cmbs; max= 101 cmbs).
In one shovel test, water was encountered at a depth of 70 cmbs.
Six shovel tests were excavated across the landform, five of which tested positive for cultural
materials (BN-663, BN-664, SM-478, TH-493, and TH-494). The artifact assemblage consisted
of lithic debitage (n=19) composed of chert, jasper, and petrified wood. Cultural material was
broadly distributed vertically, with two items in the upper 20 cmbs, five items from 20-40 cmbs,
eight from 40-60 cmbs, and four items from 60-80 cmbs.

Site 41SA352

Site 41SA352 is a Late Prehistoric lithic scatter within the Ayish Bayou parcel and situated at the
edge of a stream terrace overlooking the former Couchatana Creek stream course to the west
(Figure 5-16). The site measured 0.12 acre in size and ranged in elevation from 164 to 166 feet
AMSL. According to the USDA-NRCS (2018) Web Soil Survey, soils within the site area are
associated with the Alazan-Besner complex (zero to two percent slopes). Shovel tests containing
cultural material revealed a soil profile characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4), dark
yellowish-brown (10YR 4/4), and light brownish-gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam (depth: min=40
cmbs; max= 80 cmbs). Shovel tests were terminated upon encountering the water table.
Seven shovel tests were excavated across the stream terrace during the delineation of the site
boundary and six contained artifacts (BN-668, BN-669, BN-670, SM-483, TH-500, and TH-501).
Cultural materials included lithic debitage (n=28) and an arrow point that compares favorably to
the Friley type (Figure 5-17) dating to the Late Prehistoric Period. Raw materials used in the
manufacturing of lithic tools consisted of jasper and petrified wood. Artifacts were recovered
between the surface and 80 cmbs (Table 5-7).

Site 41SA355

Site 41SA355 is a prehistoric lithic scatter measuring 0.18 acre in size (Figure 5-20) within the
Ayish Bayou parcel. The site was located on an alluvial terrace that overlooked a large drainage
system to the north. Ranging in elevation from 188 to 190 feet AMSL, the landform was overlain
by Metcalf-Sawton complex with zero to two percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). A typical
positive shovel test soil profile was described as yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) and very pale brown
(10YR 7/3) sandy loam with some pea-sized gravels that ranged in depth from 70 to 80 cmbs. The
center of the site area was a cleared area with managed turf and two blue, plastic water-well caps.
Much of the site area has been disturbed by the construction of these wells and clearing of the area.
An underground pipe likely connects the two wells. Several push piles containing imported
gravels were observed around the periphery of this cleared area.
Sixteen (16) shovel tests were excavated across the landform, of which 4 tested positive for cultural
materials (BN-682, BN685, BN-686, and HB-182). The artifact assemblage consisted entirely of
lithic debitage (n=7) composed of chert, jasper, and petrified wood. Four items were recovered
from the upper 20 cmbs and three were recovered from 20-40 cmbs.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive

Site 41SA356

41SA356 is a Woodland-period occupation site measuring 0.31 acre in size (Figure 5-21) within
the Ayish Bayou parcel. The site was located along a stream terrace that overlooked Ayish Bayou
to the west. With an elevation ranging from 166 to 172 feet AMSL, the site was overlain by both
Austonio fine sandy loam (5 to 12 percent slopes) and Guyton-Sawtown complex (USDA-NRCS
2018). A typical positive shovel test consisted of yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) and dark yellowishbrown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam (depth: min=20 cmbs; max: 60 cmbs). Shovel tests were excavated
to a maximum depth of 70 cmbs.
Investigators excavated nine shovel tests across the landform, and all nine tested positive for
cultural materials (BN-698, BN-699, BN-700, BN-701, BN-702, TH-524, TH-525, TH-526, and
TH-527). Artifacts consisted of lithic debitage (n=34), a sandy paste Goose Creek Plain, var.
unspecified body sherd, and a utility ware body sherd composed of grog-bone temper. Lithic raw
materials present in the assemblage included chert, jasper, and petrified wood. Artifacts were
documented to a maximum depth of 60 cmbs, while most were recovered from the upper 20 cmbs
(Table 5-8).
NRHP Eligibility
This site contains intact and relatively undisturbed archeological deposits and may have some
research potential within the project boundary. Site 41SA346 was not delineated outside the
survey area and may extend to the east. This site warrants test excavations to determine its NRHP

Site 41SA357

Site 41SA357 is an ancestral Caddo occupation site within the Ayish Bayou parcel located on the
westernmost end of an interfluve that projected outwards towards Ayish Bayou (Figure 5-22).
Ranging in elevation from 166 to 176 feet AMSL, the site measured 2.21 acres in size. Soils
consisted of Moswell loam with 5 to 15 percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests
containing cultural material revealed a soil profile characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4),
dark yellowish-brown (10YR 4/4), and pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam (depth: min=12 cmbs;
max=75 cmbs) underlain by clay. Shovel tests reached a maximum depth of 75 cmbs.
Twenty-two (22) shovel tests were excavated during delineation of Site 41SA357 and 18 contained
cultural materials (82 percent ubiquity). A total of 150 artifacts and one feature were recorded in
shovel tests at this site. Artifacts consisted of lithic debitage (n=134), FCR, a flake core, ceramic
sherds (n=13), and a piece of unidentified bone. Lithic raw materials present in this assemblage
included chert, jasper, novaculite, and petrified wood. All artifacts were recovered between 0 and
60 cmbs, although the majority (78 percent) of artifacts were recorded in the upper 20 centimeters
(Table 5-9).
The ceramic assemblage consisted of a Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified ceramic sherd of
Woodland-period age; the remainder of the sherds (n=12) were from ancestral Caddo vessels made
and used after ca. AD 800. The Caddo sherds included both plain (n=8) and decorated (n=4) body
and rim sherds from at least three vessels tempered with grog (n=6), grog-hematite (n=5), and
grog-bone-hematite (n=1). The decorated sherds included three body sherds with at least one row
of fingernail (n=2) or tool (n=1) punctated rows, and a grog-tempered rim sherd with diagonal
incised lines (possibly from a Dunkin Incised vessel) (Suhm and Jelks 1962: Plate 19) drawn from
right to left. The absence of sherds with brushed marks in the assemblage suggests that this site
may have been occupied by ancestral Caddo peoples before ca. AD 1200.

Features
One prehistoric feature was recorded at Site 41SA357. Feature 1 consisted of a pit feature centrally
located in the site, in which two shovel tests were excavated (HB-201 & TH-531). This was a
buried feature of an unknown size located between 0 and 40 cmbs. Brown (10YR 4/3 & 5/3) sandy
loam that was darker than the soil viewed in other shovel tests was observed in both shovel tests.
Clay was encountered below the sandy loam. One small, unidentifiable fragment of charred bone
was recovered between 0 and 20 cmbs in HB-201. These two shovel tests occurred at the top of
the ridge along the USACE property boundary and were excavated less than 10 meters apart. A
total of 4 ceramic sherds and 62 pieces of lithic debris were recovered from Shovel Tests HB-201
and TH-531.
NRHP Eligibility
Site 41SA357 was not delineated outside the project area, and likely extends to the east onto private
property. Overall, the portion of the site within the APE appears to have research potential within
the project area and warrants protection and avoidance until test excavations can be conducted to
determine if it meets the criteria specified in 36 CFR Part 60.4 of the NRHP.

A Cultural Resource Survey of 1,874 Acres at Sam Rayburn Reservoir and Wright Patman Lake, Texas

Chapter 6 – Results at Wright Patman Lake
This chapter presents the results of archeological field investigations of two parcels totaling 1,619
acres at Wright Patman Lake in Cass County, Texas. A total of 1,867 shovel tests were excavated
across the two parcels, for a rate of approximately 1.15 shovel tests per acre. Of these shovel tests,
515 had cultural materials from the discovery and recording of 31 newly-documented
archeological sites and 10 Isolated Finds, as well as the re-recordation of 12 previously-recorded
sites (41CS103, 41CS104, 41CS105, 41CS106, 41CS107, 41CS108, 41CS109, 41CS110,
41CS111, 41CS116, 41CS117, 41CS118). Appendix A provides maps of shovel test locations by
parcel, while descriptions of positive shovel tests by site are presented in Appendix B. A detailed
analysis of the prehistoric ceramic sherds recovered from Site 41CS386 is presented in Chapter
7.
In general, the topography of the two parcels was characterized by high spots and linear ridges
separated by low-lying, sometimes inundated, areas. These high spots were likely formed through
fluctuations in the lake’s water level. Since both parcels fell below Wright Patman Lake’s
maximum conservation pool level, it is not uncommon for these sites to be inundated. Adverse
effects that may occur inland during inundation include “large scale wasting or slumping of
deposits from sloped surfaces and vertical forces, sheetwash from higher sloped surface, water
runoff in the form of rills and gullies, and dispersal of saturated soils” (Corcoran et al. 2001:22
cited in Harrell et al. 2015). Alston Thoms (2004) concluded that these inundated landforms can
lose up to 50 centimeters of surface deposits, while along the shoreline up to 1 meter of sediment
loss may occur, leaving behind a deflated surface with exposed clay. All newly-recorded and
revisited sites are regularly impacted by alluvial erosion. During the survey, the lake’s water level
fluctuated between 224 and 238 feet above the NGVD29 vertical datum.
Vegetation consisted of pine trees and mixed hardwoods, with an understory composed of
greenbrier and palmetto (Sabal spp.) (Figure 6-1). Ground surface visibility was poor (0-10
percent) across all sites, except along the shoreline, where visibility was good (75-100 percent).
Disturbances observed during survey consisted of a utility line corridor, alluvial erosion, timber
harvesting, artifact collecting/looting, and those activities associated with public use (e.g., paved
road, mechanically scraped surfaces, camping areas, etc.).

Site 41CS103

Site 41CS103 is a previously recorded site located within the Flatwoods parcel described by Alton
Briggs as a “small, chipping station eroding into a cove at Wright Patman Lake” (Atlas 2018). No
site boundary is depicted on the Atlas, but the site is described as measuring 10 by 10 meters in
size and the centroid is plotted south of previously-recorded Site 41CS104 (Figure 6-2). At the
time of the site’s initial recording, only lithic debitage was observed on the surface. Based on
these findings, no additional work was recommended for Site 41CS103.
During the site revisit, investigators found the area to be marshy and heavily eroded with exposed
roots and a clay surface texture. A low mound was identified about 40 m north of the plotted
centroid and was tested (BN-454) on the supposition that the centroid may have been slightly misplotted on the Atlas. This test yielded a soil profile characterized by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6)
clay to a depth of 10 cmbs but contained no cultural material. The lack of cultural-bearing deposits
led investigators to conclude that the site is either completely eroded away or was mis-plotted on
the Atlas (2018). It is likely that Site 41CS103 was the southern extension of Site 41CS104 and
has since been destroyed from fluctuations in the lake’s water level.
NRHP Eligibility
This site lacks substantive research potential because of limited archeological content and is
considered not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Site 41CS104

Site 41CS104 was first recorded in the 1970s by Alton Briggs (Atlas 2018). Measuring 100 by
100 meters in size, the site was recorded on an eroding peninsula. No site perimeter is shown on
the Atlas, with only a centroid being plotted. Artifacts observed by Briggs included lithic debitage,
unifacially worked blades, and prehistoric ceramics. Briggs concluded that the site had research
potential and recommended further testing to determine its eligibility.
Recent investigations indicated that the site is a prehistoric occupation site dating from the
Paleoindian through the ancestral Caddo period (Figure 6-3). The site was located within the
Flatwoods parcel at the northern end of a narrow ridge that was oriented northwest to southeast.
The periphery of the landform was heavily eroded with exposed roots and a clayey surface texture.
Measuring 2.82 acres in size, the site’s elevation ranged from 226 to 230 feet AMSL. The
landform was underlain by Eastwood very fine sandy loam (one to five percent slopes) and Metcalf
silt loam (zero to two percent slopes) (USDA-NRCS 2018). A typical positive shovel test
consisted of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam (depth: min=14 cmbs; max=100 cmbs) underlain by
strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) clay. Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of 100 cmbs.
During the delineation of Site 41CS104, 18 shovel tests were excavated within the site area, of
which 12 tested positive for cultural materials (BN-449, BN-450, BN-452, BN-453, DS-125, DS126, DS-127, SM-336, SM-337, SM-339, TH-331, and TH-332). Artifacts revealed a slight
bimodal distribution, with modes at 0-20 cmbs and 40-60 cmbs, and were present to 100 cmbs
(Table 6-1).
In addition, artifacts were observed on the shore and 157 surface artifacts were collected. The
temporally diagnostic projectile points collected from the surface included items that compare
favorably to Scottsbluff (Figure 6-4A) dating to the Paleoindian Period; Bulverde (Figure 6-5 A,
B) dating to the Early Archaic Period; Gary (Figure 6-5 C-E) dating to the Woodland Period; and
Catahoula (Figure 6-4 B) dating to the Formative Period.
Overall, the collected artifact assemblage consisted of lithic debitage (n=125), FCR, a flake core,
bifaces (n=9), biface fragments (n=6), dart points (n=19), an arrow point (n=1), ceramic sherds
(n=26), a piece of charcoal, and an unidentified bone fragment. Raw materials used in the
manufacturing of lithic tools at the site included chert, jasper, novaculite, petrified wood, and
quartzite.

The ceramic sherds were from an ancestral Caddo occupation that likely dates after ca. AD 1200
because of one parallel brushed body sherd in Shovel Test SM-336. The 25 sherds included 19
plain and 6 decorated sherds, from grog (n=18), grog-bone (n=1), and grog-hematite (n=6)tempered vessels. Five of the decorated sherds were from utility ware vessels. They included a
parallel brushed body sherd, a diagonal opposed incised body sherd from a Dunkin Incised vessel,
a body sherd with parallel incised lines, and two sherds with punctated decorative elements. One
was a grog-bone-tempered rim with a row of tool punctations, and the other was a grog-tempered
body sherd with at least two rows of circular punctations. The one fine ware sherd was a grogtempered body sherd from a bottle with curvilinear engraved lines.
NRHP Eligibility
This site appears to have research potential and warrants protection and avoidance until test
excavations can be conducted to determine if it meets the criteria specified in 36 CFR Part 60.4 of
the NRHP.

Site 41CS105

Site 41CS105 was originally recorded in 1970 by Alton Briggs (Atlas 2018). According to Briggs,
the site encompassed an area measuring 50 by 30 meters in size, with buried deposits observed
between 10 and 30 cmbs. No site perimeter is shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid being
plotted. Briggs assessed the site through surface survey and did not perform any subsurface
testing. He reported finding a projectile point and lithic debitage.
Recent investigations indicate that 41CS105 is a large, multicomponent occupation site dating
from the Paleoindian Period through Historic times (Figure 6-6). Located within the Flatwoods
parcel, the site extended across a stream terrace that once overlooked the Sulphur River to the
north. Measuring 23.9 acres in size, the site’s elevation ranged from 228 to 240 feet AMSL.
Topographically, the site was characterized by a level to gently undulating surface that was
dissected by four minor drainages. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils
consist of Eastwood very fine sandy loam (5 to 15 percent slopes), Latex fine sandy loam (1 to 3
percent slopes), and Metcalf silt loam (0 to 2 percent slopes). Positive shovel tests were
characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4), dark yellowish-brown (10YR 4/4), very pale brown
(10YR 7/3 & 7/4), pale brown (6/2), light gray (10YR 7/2) and gray (10YR 5/1) sandy loams
(depth: min=6 cmbs; max=102 cmbs) underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests
were excavated to a maximum depth of 102 cmbs.
During the revisit, 110 shovel tests were excavated across the landform, of which 75 tested positive
for cultural materials (68 percent ubiquity). A total of 244 artifacts and samples were collected
from shovel tests. Cultural materials were recovered from the surface to a maximum depth of 80
cmbs, with material strongly concentrated in the upper 40 cmbs (Table 6-2).
Additionally, artifacts were collected from the surface along the eastern and northern shorelines.
A total of 588 artifacts were collected from the surface, including 505 prehistoric artifacts and 92
items dating to the Historic Period. Prehistoric cultural materials consisted of lithic debitage
(n=226), ground stone (n=12), a perforator, a pin drill (Figure 6-10), bifaces (n=3) and biface
fragments (n=5); a flake core, dart points (n=12); arrow points (n=3); untyped projectile points
(n=8), FCR (n=5), and ceramic sherds (n=228). The temporally diagnostic projectile points include
items that compare favorably to Scottsbluff (Figure 6-8A) dating to the Paleoindian Period;
Dawson (Figure 6-9 D) dating to the Middle Archaic Period; Ellis (Figure 6-9C) and Godley
(Figure 6-9E) dating to the Late Archaic Period; Gary (Figure 6-9A, B) dating to the Woodland
Period; and Scallorn (Figure 6-7A) dating to the Late Prehistoric Period.
Overall, collected historic materials included stoneware ceramic sherds (n=7), undecorated
whiteware ceramic sherds (n=16), a decorated whiteware ceramic rim sherd with pinkish
underglaze along the scalloped rim and overglazed black decal floral designs on the interior of the
sherd, colorless vessel glass shards (n=30), a clear glass bottle, clear window glass shards (n=6),
shards of amber colored vessel glass shards (n=10), an amber snuff bottle, blue vessel glass shards
(n=3), a shard of pink textured glass, milk glass shards (n=2), concrete fragments (n=2), a tobacco
tin, oxidized metal nails (n=9), miscellaneous metal hardware, and a porcelain knob. Historic
artifacts from shovel tests were primarily from the northern portion of the site, closest to 41CS385.

Overall, a total of 311 ceramic vessel sherds were collected from 41CS105. In the shovel testing,
23 shovel tests contained ceramic vessel sherds from 0-80 cmbs. The assemblage included sherds
from plain ware (82 percent), utility ware (12 percent), and fine ware (6 percent) vessels (Table
6-3). The plain to decorated sherd ratio was 4.54, and 67 percent of the decorated sherds were
from utility wares.

More than 75 percent of the sherds in the 41CS105 assemblage were from vessels tempered solely
with grog; another 19 percent were from vessels tempered with grog and other inclusions,
including bone and hematite (see Table 6-3). Sherds from vessels tempered solely with burned
bone comprised only 4.3 percent of the sherd assemblage, and sherds tempered with bone, as well
as grog or hematite represented 17 percent of the sherd sample. Hematite is a temper inclusion in
only 3 percent of the sherds, primarily in combination with grog. Utility wares vessels at the site
were tempered with various combinations of grog, bone, and hematite, but the fine wares were
from vessels tempered only with grog (see Table 6-3).
Sherds with appliqued decorative elements comprised 19.4 percent of the utility ware sherds from
41CS105 (Table 6-4). They included sherds with parallel or straight appliqued ridges, as well as
one sherd, probably from a post-AD 1500 Moore Noded vessel (Kelley 2012; Webb 1959), with
rows of appliqued nodes.
The brushed and brushed-incised rim and body sherds, from Karnack Brushed-Incised or Pease
Brushed-Incised vessels, represented 22 percent of the utility wares from Site 41CS105, pointing
to a Late Caddo Period occupation in the ceramic assemblage. One rim had horizontal brushing
marks, while body sherds had parallel brushing marks and/or incised lines. These marks and lines
were likely oriented vertically on the body. One body sherd had parallel brushing marks and a
single opposed incised line.
Incised rim and body sherds account for 27.8 percent of the utility ware sherds in the Site 41CS105
assemblage. One rim sherd had diagonal incised lines, perhaps from a Dunkin Incised vessel, and
the body sherds had opposed, parallel, or straight incised lines.
One grog-tempered, lower rim-body sherd in the collection from the site had incised decorative
elements on the rim and punctated elements on the vessel body (Figure 6-11). There are crosshatched incised lines on the rim and linear tool punctated rows on the body.

Figure 6-11: Utility Ware Sherds from Site 41CS105
A) incised-punctated lower rim-body sherd; B) cane punctated body sherd; and C) large tool
punctated body sherd
The rim and body sherds with punctated decorative elements included punctations made with a cut
cane (Figure 6-11B), a circular tool, and larger tool punctations in horizontal or diagonal rows
(Figure 6-11C). The larger tool punctations had a rectangular to square shape, perhaps made by
a wood dowel.
One of the utility ware sherds from Site 41CS105 was from a post-AD 1500 Belcher Ridged jar
(Kelley 2012; Suhm and Jelks 1962: Plate 11). The sherd had parallel (or vertical) ridges on the
body of a jar.
The engraved sherds (n=18) from fine ware vessels represented 33 percent of the decorated sherds
in the Site 41CS105 assemblage; they were from carinated bowls and bottles. The bottle sherds,
from unknown types, had curvilinear engraved lines, while the carinated bowl rim sherds had
horizontal engraved lines, horizontal-vertical engraved lines, horizontal-vertical engraved lines

and a hatched zone, and multiple and closely-spaced horizontal engraved lines. These sherds were
from Barkman Engraved vessels (Suhm and Jelks 1962: Plate 4) made and used during the Late
Caddo Period, Texarkana phase, from ca. AD 1400-1550.
The principal ancestral Caddo component represented in the decorated ceramic vessel sherds from
Site 41CS105 is a Late Caddo Period, Texarkana phase dating from ca. AD 1400-1550. This
component included utility ware jars such as Karnack Brushed-Incised and Pease Brushed-Incised,
and Moore Noded bowls, while the primary fine ware was Barkman Engraved carinated bowls. A
few utility ware sherds—including a possible Dunkin Incised rim, a cane punctated body sherd,
and a cross-hatched incised-linear tool punctated lower rim and body sherd—suggest that Site
41CS105 was also settled by ancestral Caddo peoples before ca. AD 1200.
Artifacts from the Historic Period were predominantly documented scattered across the surface of
the site, with an area of higher density scattered brick, which is believed to be a chimney fall, and
a rubbish concentration (Figures 6-12 and 6-13). The “chimney fall” is comprised of clusters of
brick and sandstone in a rectangular area. On the surface, investigators documented broken Atlanta
Brick Company bricks and rough-cut sandstone blocks nearly identical to those found at Site
41CS385 scattered around this site (Figure 6-14). Additionally, investigators noted wagon or
buggy springs and other buggy parts such as pintles and spokes, a metal wagon wheel frame, glass
panel bottles, glass jars with threaded closures, wire and square nails, snuff bottles and parts,
stoneware ceramics, plain white tableware fragments, milk glass canning jar caps, and a variety of
bottle fragments in brown, clear, and blue. One of the brown bottle bases contains a maker’s mark
“F” in a hexagon, which was used by Fairmont Glass Works from 1933 to 1968. A clear glass
bottle base bears an Owens-Illinois mark (“I” inside an “O” inside a horizontal diamond) dating
from 1929-1960 (SHA 2018).

Historic Research
A review of USGS topographic maps from 1908 do not show any structures located at this site
(Figure 6-15). However, the map indicates that the site was located along a road that crossed the
Sulphur River at a locale called the Bobo Bridge. James Bobo was a resident and one of the
pioneering families of Cass County. He came to east Texas with his parents and extended family
(the Elias White family) in 1846. Their headright patents were in Bowie County, although over
time, some members of the Bobo family settled in Cass County on the south side of the Sulphur
River. James Bobo died in 1903 and is buried in the Antioch Cemetery, a few miles south of
Wright Patman Lake (Findagrave.com 2018b).

Figure 6-15: Sites 41CS105 and 41CS385 Depicted on a 1908 Topographic Map
Deed research shows no connection to the Bobo family (unless that connection pre-dates 1875)
(Table 6-5). The United States acquired the property from Nancy Louise (“Lou”) Wilson in 1951,
the wife of J.D, Wilson. The Wilson family owned the property since 1917, having purchased it
from well-known local merchants, A.D. Morriss and J.G. King, who operated a store in Munz City
(Alford 2010). The Wilsons and the Morriss and King families had done business together
previously. In July of 1917, Morriss and King also sold the Wilson family property near Knight’s
Bluff, where Site 41CS125 is located. However, the Wilson family only owned that property for
three years before selling it back to A.B. Morriss (A.D’s son). It is possible that J.D. Wilson and
his family lived on the Old Bobo Road property, as both J.D. and Lou are buried in the Old Liberty
Cemetery, just north of Antioch. Lou died in 1965, while J.D. died in 1936 (Findagrave.com
2018c).

Morriss and King (who were brothers-in-law) purchased the property from brothers J.H. and A.H.
Snipes, who had in turn purchased the property from R.B. McWhorter in 1902. It should be noted
that J.H. Snipes was also Abner Darden Morriss’s brother-in-law by marriage to his sister. Neither
of these individuals likely lived on this tract, as they owned property all over Cass and Bowie
counties. Moreover, deed records from other sites around Wright Patman Lake indicate that the
Snipes brothers, R.B. McWhorter, and Morriss and King swapped properties extensively
throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Sitters and Perttula 2018).
McWhorter acquired the property from John Cherry, whose family had owned it since at least
1875. Catherine Cherry is listed in the 1880 Census for this general area of Cass County as a 59year-old widow, living with her sons John (26), Richard (17), George (9), and a black boarder
named Isaac (13). However, it is not clear whether she lived on this tract or elsewhere.
The historic component of Sites 41CS105 (and 41CS385) most likely dates to the period during
which the Wilson family owned the property (1917 to 1951). No structures are depicted at this
location on the 1908 topographical map, suggesting that the home that was once at this site also
post-dates that time. The home would have been right on Bobo Bridge Road and may have been
occupied by the Wilson family. Very little information is available about J.D. or Lou Wilson.
They are not listed in census records for any year in Bowie or Cass counties. However, the 1900
Census does list a T.J. Wilson family in this area. A death certificate for Nancy Louise Wilson
from 1965 indicates she died in Atlanta, Cass County (Ancestry.com 2018b). Both Lou and J.D.
are buried in the nearby Liberty Cemetery, suggesting that both lived and died in the Site 41CS105
vicinity.
The Historic Period artifact assemblage on Site 41CS105 represents an early twentieth century
domestic assemblage occupation and is similar to that seen on nearby Site 41CS385, discussed
below. Both site locations are part of the same parcel and was owned by the J.D. and Lou Wilson
family from 1917 to 1951. Temporally diagnostic artifacts date to the early twentieth century and
there is no indication of any historic occupation earlier than that of the Wilson family.

NRHP Eligibility
Overall, this site appears to have research potential and warrants protection and avoidance until
test excavations can be conducted to determine if it meets the criteria specified in 36 CFR Part
60.4 of the NRHP.

6.4

Site 41CS106

In 1970, Alton Briggs recorded Site 41CS106, an Ancestral Caddo occupation site eroding into
the lake (Atlas 2018). Measuring 100 by 60 meters in size, the site was located on a point that
gradually sloped to the southeast. No site perimeter is shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid
being plotted. Artifacts, which were shallowly buried, consisted of lithic debitage, flake cores,
and prehistoric ceramic sherds. With very little cultural material present at the site, Briggs
recommended no additional investigations.
The site is located within the Flatwoods parcel. During the site revisit, investigators encountered
cultural materials on a heavily-eroded shoreline with a clay surface texture (Figure 6-16).
Elevation along the shore was estimated to be 226 feet AMSL. Along the shoreline, investigators
observed and collected from the surface lithic debitage (n=11) and a single plain body ceramic
sherd from a bone-tempered vessel. Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the
site included jasper, novaculite, and quartzite. Eight shovel tests were excavated to the south and
above the shore where artifacts were exposed, none of which recovered cultural materials.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive
research potential because of limited archeological content and is considered not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Site 41CS107

Site 41CS107 was recorded by Alton Briggs in 1970 (Atlas 2018). At the time of its initial
recording, the site measured 100 by 80 meters and was eroding into the lake. No site perimeter is
shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid being plotted. Briggs observed lithic debitage, flake
cores, and biface fragments between the surface and 40 cmbs. Based on his findings, no additional
investigations were recommended for the site.
Current investigations characterize the site as a prehistoric lithic and historic debris scatter
encompassing an area measuring 8.9 acres in size (Figure 6-17). The site is located within the
Flatwoods parcel at the eastern end of a finger ridge that sloped to the north, east, and south towards
Wright Patman Lake. With an elevation of 228 to 246 feet AMSL, the site was overlain by
Eastwood very fine sandy loam with 1 to 5 and 5 to 15 percent slopes, and Metcalf silt loam with
0 to 2 percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests containing cultural material revealed a
soil profile characterized by pale brown (10YR 6/3) to yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam
(depth: min=10 cmbs; max=25 cmbs) underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests
terminated at a maximum depth of 25 cmbs.
During the site revisit, more than 40 shovel tests were excavated across the finger ridge, and only
three of these tested positive for cultural materials (BN-336, HB-092, and HB-093). These three
shovel tests each yielded a single lithic debitage flake from the upper 20 cmbs. In addition, artifacts
were observed on the surface, eroding out along the shoreline at the eastern- and southern-most
end of the site. The surface assemblage in this area consisted of lithic debitage (n=42), a tested
cobble, a ground stone fragment, the medial portion of an unidentified dart point, and Native
American ceramic sherds (n=2). The sherds included a plain grog-tempered rim sherd and a plain
body sherd from a grog-bone-hematite-tempered vessel. Raw materials used in the manufacturing
of lithic tools at the site included jasper, novaculite, quartzite, and quartzitic sandstone.
Historic artifacts, which were all observed on the surface, included one shard of amethyst glass,
fragments from a cast-iron stove, a wash tub, barbed wire, a steel drum, and two glazed-ware
ceramic sherds. The historic materials were observed scattered on the landform’s surface with no
apparent patterning.
The site is located at what was formerly the edge of a waterway known as Sallie Keaton Slough;
however, the waterway is currently submerged under the lake. Given the location of the site, the
Historic-period materials are most likely part of a household debris dump associated with a former
farmstead. A 1910 USGS topographic map depicts no structures at this location, although a
farmstead is located a few hundred meters west of the site area (Figure 6-18). It is reasonable to
suppose that the debris represents materials from that former house. Deed research (Table 6-6)
suggests that the Historic-period artifacts probably relate to the Bullard family, who purchased 740
acres in 1876 from the Carlow brothers. The Carlow family first immigrated to Alabama from
Ireland, then came to the Douglassville area in the early 1850s. They were among the region’s
first white settlers and the family became important figures in the Cass County community
(McWhorter 1975).

The James F. Bullard family also lived in this area and are in the census records for 1880 and 1900.
James Bullard died in 1899 and is buried in the Douglassville Cemetery (Findagrave.com 2018a).
His widow, Mary, was still living on their property in 1900 with an extended family consisting of
two grown (single) daughters, five grandchildren, a married daughter and son-in-law, a cousin,
and aunt. The creek that runs just south of this property is called Bullard (aka Ballard) Creek,
likely named after this family. The 1900 Census shows that their closest neighbor was Alvis H.
Snipes and his family. Mary Bullard and her children sold her property to her brother, J.H. Snipes
in 1902.

Site 41CS108

Site 41CS108 was initially plotted on a small point that projected into a slough of Wright Patman
Lake by Alton Briggs in 1970 (Atlas 2018). Measuring 40 by 30 meters in size, artifacts were
recorded to a depth of 12 cmbs. No site perimeter is shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid being
plotted. Cultural materials documented at the site consisted solely of lithic debitage. At the time
of the site’s recording, alluvial erosion had impacted the site from the east, west, and south. No
additional work was recommended by Briggs.
Recent investigations documented the site on a small point that sloped from northwest to southeast
towards the lake (Figure 6-19). Located within the Flatwoods parcel, the landform was overlain
by Metcalf silt loam with zero to two percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018) and bordered by
drainages to the east and west. Investigators encountered artifacts both on the shore’s surface, as
well as within shovel tests. As a result, the site’s boundary was expanded to encompass an area
measuring 0.44 acre in size, with an elevation of 226 feet AMSL. Positive shovel tests were
characterized by humus underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay and were excavated to a
maximum depth of 10 cmbs.
Eleven (11) shovel tests were excavated along the small point, and only two tested positive for
cultural materials (BN-347 and BN-349). Two pieces of lithic debris were recovered from 0-10
cmbs. In addition, artifacts were observed on the surface and two pieces of FCR and one piece of
lithic debitage were collected from the surface. Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic
tools at the site included jasper and quartzite.
NRHP Eligibility

Site 41CS109

During the 1970s, Alton Briggs recorded Site 41CS109 (Atlas 2018). At the time, Briggs observed
large amounts of lithic debris eroding into a slough. Artifacts were recorded across an area
measuring 45 by 30 meters in size, and to a maximum depth of 10 cmbs. No site perimeter is
shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid being plotted. Cultural material consisted of lithic
debitage, a flake core, bifacially retouched flakes, and a biface. Based on his findings, Briggs
recommended no additional work at the site.
Recent investigations found that Site 41CS109 is a prehistoric lithic scatter measuring 4.5 acres in
size, much larger than Briggs’ initial assessment (Figure 6-20). The site is located within the
Flatwoods parcel at the eastern end of a finger ridge overlooking Wright Patman Lake. The eastern
shoreline has been heavily eroded through wave action, resulting in a one-meter high cut bank.
The site was bordered by a low, marshy area to the north, and a drainage to the south. With an
elevation of 226 to 240 feet AMSL, the landform was overlain by Metcalf silt loam with zero to
two percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests containing cultural material revealed a soil
profile characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam (depth: min=7 cmbs; max=40
cmbs) underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth
of 50 cmbs.
Archeologists excavated over 40 shovel tests on the landform, only seven of which tested positive
for cultural materials (BN-236, BN-237, BN-238, HB-051, SM-180, TH-167, and TH-172).
Artifacts recovered through shovel testing consisted of lithic debitage (n=13) and one piece of
FCR. Overall, 11 of the 14 items were recovered from the upper 20 cmbs and only three items
were recovered from 20-40 cmbs (ST TH-167)
In addition, from the site’s eastern shoreline, investigators collected lithic debitage (n=29), FCR,
biface fragments (n=2), and a dart point that compares favorably to the Carrollton type (Figure 621A) dating to the Middle Archaic Period. From the northern shore, collections included lithic
debitage (n=58) and projectile points (n=3) that compare favorably to the Gary type (Figure 621B-D) dating to the Woodland Period. Lithic raw material used in the manufacturing of lithic
tools at the site included Big Fork chert, jasper, novaculite, and quartzite.

Site 41CS110

In 1970, Site 41CS110 was recorded eroding into the lake by Alton Briggs (Atlas 2018). At that
time, the site was estimated to be 30 by 50 meters in size, with artifacts restricted to the surface.
No site perimeter is shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid being plotted. Cultural materials
documented during the site’s initial recording included lithic debitage, biface fragments, a
projectile point, and prehistoric ceramics. Based on his findings, Briggs recommended additional
testing at the site to determine eligibility.
Recent investigations at Site 41CS110 suggest that the site is a prehistoric occupation site with an
Ancestral Caddo component (Figure 6-22). Located on a finger ridge within the Flatwoods parcel,
the site was bordered by two drainages to the north and south and sloped gradually to the east
towards the lake. Measuring 5.7 acres in size, elevation across the site area ranged from 236 to
243 feet AMSL. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils are characterized
by Eastwood very fine sandy loam with one to five percent slopes. Positive shovel tests were
characterized by pale brown (10YR 6/3) to yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth:
min=12 cmbs; max=40 cmbs) containing sandstone gravels underlain by strong brown (7.5YR
5/6) clay. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 76 cmbs.

Archeologists excavated roughly 28 shovel tests across the finger ridge; eight contained artifacts
(BN-232, BN-233, BN-234, HB-045, HB-046, HB-047, HB-050, and SM-170). Cultural materials
recovered during shovel testing consisted of lithic debitage (n=16) and FCR (n=1) (Table 6-7).
Artifacts were documented to a maximum depth of 76 cmbs.

Investigators also collected cultural material from the site’s eastern shoreline. Surface materials
included lithic debitage (n=50), ground stone (n=2), and a plain grog-bone-tempered ceramic body
sherd. Jasper, novaculite, and quartzite were used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. However, Site 41CS110
is in close proximity to 41CS111, which is located south of the unnamed drainage that separates
the sites. This site may warrant test excavations to establish whether it is associated with Site
41CS 111 and to determine its NRHP eligibility.

6.9

Site 41CS111

Site 41CS111 is a prehistoric occupation site dating to the Woodland Period (Figure 6-23). The
site was located on a narrow ridge that was oriented northwest to southeast. Measuring 5.05 acres
in size, the site ranged in elevation from 235 to 243 feet AMSL. Site 41CS111 was bordered to
the north and south by drainages, with the lake to the east. Soils within the site area are associated
with Eastwood very fine sandy loam (1 to 5 and 5 to 15 percent slopes) (USDA-NRCS 2018).
Positive shovel tests were characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth:
min=5 cmbs; max=35 cmbs) underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam. Shovel tests were
excavated to a maximum depth of 40 cmbs.
Site 41CS111 was first recorded in the 1970s by Alton Briggs (Atlas 2018). Briggs recovered
lithic debitage, flake cores, a biface fragment, dart point fragments (n=4), arrow points (n=2), and
a single ceramic sherd between the surface and 35 cmbs. The site dimensions are incomplete and
no site perimeter is shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid being plotted.

The site is located within the Flatwoods parcel. During recent investigations, investigators
excavated 38 shovel tests, 19 of which contained artifacts (50 percent ubiquity). Cultural materials
recovered during shovel testing consisted of lithic debitage (n=51), a ground stone, and a projectile
point that compares favorably to the Gary type, dating to the Woodland Period. Artifacts were
documented to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs, but are most strongly present in the upper 20 cmbs

In addition, artifacts were collected from the surface along the eastern shoreline. Shoreline
artifacts included lithic debitage (n=37), bifaces (n=5), one item of ground stone, four projectile
points that compare favorably to Carrollton, Kent, and Gary types (Figure 6-24) dating
respectively to the Middle Archaic, the Late Archaic, and the Woodland Periods, and ceramic
sherds (n=10). Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site included jasper,
novaculite, and quartzite.
As mentioned above, ten ceramic vessel body (n=8) and base (n=2) sherds were collected from the
shoreline at Site 41CS111. They were from plain grog-tempered (n=5) and grog-hematitetempered (n=5) vessels. The thickness of the base sherds (11.0 mm and 13.2 mm) and the absence
of any decorated sherds in the assemblage suggests that the sherds were from a Woodland-period
Fourche Maline culture occupation (Schambach 1982, 1998).

Site 41CS116

Site 41CS116 was first recorded in the 1970s by Alton Briggs (Atlas 2018) as an Archaic
occupation characterized by lithic debitage, flake cores, bifaces, a pitted stone, projectile points
(n=8), and a ceramic sherd. Investigations by Briggs consisted of a surface inspection with
artifacts observed across an area measuring 300 by 60 meters in size. No site perimeter is shown
on the Atlas, with only a centroid being plotted. Briggs recommended additional work at the site.
Recent investigations indicate that the site is a multi-component, prehistoric occupation dating
from the Paleoindian Period through Ancestral Caddo times (Figure 6-25). Site 41CS116 is
located within the Flatwoods parcel on a stream terrace that overlooked Ballard Creek to the south.
Measuring 20.9 acres in size, the site’s elevation ranged from 230 to 243 feet AMSL.
Topographically, Site 41CS116 was spread out across a northwest-to-southeast oriented landform
that compared favorably to a finger ridge. The site was bordered by drainages to the north and
west. Soils within the site area are associated with the Eastwood very fine sandy loam (1 to 5 and
5 to 15 percent slopes) soil unit (USDA-NRCS 2018). A typical positive shovel test soil profile
consisted of brown (10YR 5/3) to pale brown (10YR 6/2) sandy loam (depth: min=18 cmbs;
max=100 cmbs) underlain by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) to strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam.
Shovel tests reached a maximum depth of 100 cmbs.

In addition, artifacts were exposed along the southern and eastern shoreline and 117 artifacts were
collected from the surface, including three pieces of ground stone, six ceramic sherds, a dart point,
a biface, and 106 pieces of lithic debitage.
Overall, the collected artifact assemblage consisted of lithic debitage (n=273), a projectile point
that compares favorably to the San Patrice type (Figure 6-26) dating to the Paleoindian Period, a
dart point fragment, bifaces (n=2), a tested cobble, a flake core, a pitted stone, ground stone (n=3),
and ceramic sherds (n=8). All the sherds were plain and from grog-tempered (n=4), grog-bonetempered (n=1), and grog-hematite-tempered (n=3) vessels. Lithic raw material among the
artifacts included chert, jasper, novaculite, and quartzite.
NRHP Eligibility
This site appears to have research potential and warrants protection and avoidance until test
excavations can be conducted to determine if it meets the criteria specified in 36 CFR Part 60.4 of
the NRHP.

Site 41CS117

Site 41CS117 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located along a linear landform that sloped northeast to
southwest (Figure 6-27). The site was bordered to the east and west by drainages, with the lake
to the south. The site measured 1.8 acres in size and ranged in elevation from 226 to 232 feet
AMSL. Soils within the site area are associated with the Eastwood very fine sandy loam (1 to 5
and 5 to 15 percent slopes) soil unit (USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests were characterized
by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth: min=10 cmbs; max=20 cmbs) underlain by
strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay, which were dug to a maximum depth of 22 cmbs.
The site was first recorded by Alton Briggs in the 1970s (Atlas 2018). No site perimeter is shown
on the Atlas, with only a centroid being plotted. He observed lithic debitage and a projectile point
on the surface.
The site is located within the Flatwoods parcel. During the site revisit, approximately 11 shovel
tests were excavated across the landform, of which three contained artifacts (BN-191, BN-192,
and SM-136). Cultural materials recovered during shovel testing consisted of chert, novaculite,
and quartzite lithic debitage (n=4). Artifacts were observed to a maximum depth of 20 cmbs.
Additionally, a low-density scatter of lithic debitage was observed on the site’s southern shore.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive
research potential because of limited archeological content and is considered not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Site 41CS118

Site 41CS118 is a prehistoric occupation site dating from the Woodland Period through Ancestral
Caddo times (Figure 6-28). Measuring 8.4 acres in size, the site ranged in elevation from 226 to
242 feet AMSL. The site was situated along a finger ridge that was bordered by drainages to the
east and west, and sloped gradually to the south towards the lake. According to the USDA-NRCS
Web Soil Survey (2018), soils within the site area are associated with the Eastwood very fine sandy
loam (one to five percent slopes) soil unit. A typical positive shovel test soil profile consisted of
yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth: min=6 cmbs; max=20 cmbs) underlain by strong
brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam. Shovel tests reached a maximum depth of 30 cmbs.
Alton Briggs recorded Site 41CS118 in the 1970s (Atlas 2018). At the time, the site was
characterized by a large quantity of lithic debitage recorded from the surface to a maximum depth
of 20 cmbs. No site perimeter is shown on the Atlas, with only a centroid being plotted.
The site is located within the Flatwoods parcel. During the 2018 site revisit, 39 shovel tests were
excavated across the landform, of which 11 contained artifacts (BN-195, BN-196, BN-197, BN198, BN-202, BN-203, BN-205, HB-026, SM-144, SM-146, and SM-147). Artifacts recovered
during shovel testing consisted solely of lithic debitage (n=13) and were documented to a
maximum depth of 20 cmbs.
Cultural material was also observed along the site’s southern shoreline. Here, investigators
documented abundant lithic debitage (n=500+), a biface, biface fragments (n=4), projectile points
that compare favorably to the Gary type (n=3; Figure 6-29 A-C) dating to the Woodland Period,
an arrow point that compares favorably to the Scallorn type (Figure 6-29 D) dating to the Late
Prehistoric Period, an unidentifiable arrow point, and ceramic sherds (n=4). The ceramic vessel
sherds were from grog-tempered vessels, including one plain rim, two plain body, and one thick
(13.0 mm) base sherd. These sherds may be from Woodland-period Fourche Maline culture
vessels (i.e., Williams Plain). Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site
included jasper, novaculite, and quartzite. The lithic debitage encountered on the shoreline was
not collected.
NRHP Eligibility
Site 41CS118 is in close proximity to 41CS111, which is located northeast of the unnamed
drainage that separates the sites. This site contains intact and relatively undisturbed archeological
deposits and may have some research potential. This site warrants test excavations to determine
its NRHP eligibility.

Site 41CS372

Site 41CS372 is a prehistoric lithic scatter measuring approximately 0.13 acre in size (Figure 633). The site is located within the Flatwoods parcel along a high spot that was surrounded by lowlying, wetland areas. The landform was oriented north-to-south and measured roughly 15 meters
by 3-4 meters. A drainage passed the site to the south before emptying into Ballard Creek. With
an elevation of 243 to 245 feet AMSL, the landform was overlain by Eastwood very fine sandy
loam with 5 to 15 percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests containing cultural material
revealed a soil profile characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth: min=10
cmbs; max=54 cmbs) containing sandstone gravels underlain by a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay.
Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of 58 cmbs.
During site delineation, six shovel tests were excavated along the landform, and three tested
positive for cultural materials (BN-043, BN-044, and SM-029). The site’s artifact assemblage
consisted solely of lithic debitage (n=4). Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools
at the site included jasper and novaculite. Of the four items recovered, one was from 0-10 cmbs,
one was from 20-40 cmbs, and two were from 40-53 cmbs.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive

Site 41CS373

Site 41CS373 is an Ancestral Caddo occupation site that measured roughly 0.28 acre in size
(Figure 6-34). The site is located within the Flatwoods parcel along the edge of a stream terrace
that overlooked a drainage to the northeast, which fed into Ballard Creek. Elevation across the
site area ranged from 250 to 253 feet AMSL. Topographically, the landform consisted of high
spots separated by drainages. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils are
characterized by Eastwood very fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent slopes. A typical positive
shovel test soil profile consisted of brown (10YR 5/3) to dark yellowish-brown (10YR 4/4) sandy
loam (depth: min=60 cmbs; max=100 cmbs) containing manganese concretions underlain by
yellowish-brown (10YR 5/6) clay loam. Shovel tests reached a maximum depth of 100 cmbs.
Fifteen (15) shovel tests were excavated across the landform, of which four had cultural materials
(DS-022, DS-023, TH-010, and TH-011). Artifacts included lithic debitage (n=5) and a single
ceramic sherd. The sherd was a lower rim-body sherd from a grog-tempered jar of post-AD 800
ancestral Caddo manufacture. The rim had rows of fingernail punctations, while the body was
plain. Cultural material was observed between the surface and 100 cmbs. Of the six artifacts
recovered, two were from 0-20 cmbs, one was from 40-60 cmbs, one (the ceramic sherd) was from
60-80 cmbs (ST TH-010), and two were from 80-100 cmbs (ST TH-011). Lithic raw material
among the artifacts consisted of jasper, novaculite, petrified wood, and quartzite.
NRHP Eligibility
Site 41CS373 was not delineated outside of the project area and could extend to the west. Within
the APE, the site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances and lacks
substantive research potential because of limited archeological content and is considered not

site was flat with sporadic high spots. Soils within the site area are associated with the Eastwood
very fine sandy loam (5 to 15 percent slopes) soil unit (USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests
were characterized by brown (10YR 5/3) to yellowish-brown sandy loam (depth: min=12 cmbs;
max=40 cmbs) underlain by a strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) clay loam, which extended to a depth
over 40 cmbs.
Archeologists excavated 21 shovel tests across the stream terrace, only three of which contained
artifacts (BN-077, BN-078, and DS-032). Cultural materials recovered during shovel testing
consisted of chert, jasper, and novaculite lithic debitage (n=3). Two items were recovered from
0-15 cmbs and one item was recovered from 20-40 cmbs.

Site 41CS375

Site 41CS375 is a prehistoric lithic scatter measuring approximately 1.21 acres in size (Figure 636). The site was located within the Flatwoods parcel along a finger ridge overlooking a drainage
that once emptied into the Sulphur River to the west. Topographically, the finger ridge was
oriented east to west and overlaid by high spots. Elevation ranged from 228 to 233 feet AMSL,
while sloping to the north, south, and west. The site is overlain by Eastwood very fine sandy loam
with one to five percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests containing cultural material
revealed a soil profile characterized by brown (10YR 5/4) to yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy
loam (depth: min=10 cmbs; max=40 cmbs) underlaid by a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam.
Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of 50 cmbs.
During site delineation, 28 shovel tests were excavated along the finger ridge, and nine tested
positive for cultural materials (BN-089, DS-036, DS-038, SM-064, SM-065, TH-029, TH-031,
TH-032, and TH-033). The site’s artifact assemblage consisted of lithic debitage (n=11) and a
single ground stone fragment. Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site
included jasper and quartzite. Of the 11 artifacts, eight were recovered between 0-20 cmbs and
three were recovered between 20-40 cmbs.

Site 41CS376

Site 41CS376 is a prehistoric lithic scatter that measured roughly 4.78 acres in size (Figure 6-37).
The site was located within the Flatwoods parcel at the northern end of a finger ridge overlooking
the former Sulphur River channel. Elevation across the site area ranged from 235 to 240 feet
AMSL. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils are characterized by
Eastwood very fine sandy loam with both 1 to 5 and 5 to 15 percent slopes. A typical positive
shovel test soil profile consisted of brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam (depth: min=6 cmbs; max=40
cmbs) underlain by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam. Shovel tests reached a maximum
depth of 50 cmbs.
Sixty-one (61) shovel tests were excavated across the landform, of which 14 had cultural materials
(BN-094, BN-095, BN-096, BN-097, BN-099, DS-045, DS-049, DS-050, SM-069, SM-070, SM072, SM-073, SM-074, and TH-048). Artifacts included lithic debitage (n=20) and a biface. Of
the total subsurface artifacts, 19 were recovered from the upper 20 cmbs and two were from 2030 cmbs. Lithic raw materials among the artifacts consisted of chert, jasper, novaculite, petrified
wood, and quartzite.

Site 41CS377

Site 41CS377 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located within the Flatwoods parcel along a stream
terrace that overlooked Ballard Creek to the west (Figure 6-38). Sitting at an elevation of 243 feet
AMSL, the site measured 0.12 acre in size. The stream terrace sloped gradually to the southwest.
Soils within the site area are associated with Eastwood very fine sandy loam (one to five percent
slopes; USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests were characterized by brown (10YR 5/3) loam
(depth: min=5 cmbs; max=20 cmbs) underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay, which extended
to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs.
Archeologists excavated 18 shovel tests across the stream terrace of which only three contained
artifacts (DS-062, TH-064, and TH-066). Cultural materials recovered during shovel testing
consisted of chert, jasper, and quartzite lithic debitage (n=6). All artifacts were recovered from
the upper 20 cmbs.

Site 41CS380

Site 41CS380 is an Ancestral Caddo occupation site measuring 1.6 acres in size (Figure 6-41).
The site is located within the Flatwoods parcel on a stream terrace that overlooks Ballard Creek to
the east. With an elevation of 228 to 240 feet AMSL, the landform was overlain by Eastwood
very fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent slopes and Socagee silty clay loam with 0 to 1 percent
slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests containing cultural material revealed a soil profile
characterized by very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam (depth: min=30 cmbs; max=103 cmbs)
underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam. Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth
of 103 cmbs.
During the delineation of Site 41CS380, 26 shovel tests were excavated along the landform, and
14 tested positive for cultural materials (BN-260, BN-261, BN-262, BN-263, BN-264, BN-267,
HB-061, SM-196, SM-197, SM-198, SM-200, TH-183, TH-187, and TH-454). The site’s artifact
assemblage consisted of lithic debitage (n=17), a biface, and ceramic sherds (n=13). The ceramic
sherds can be refit into two separate pieces. Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic
tools at the site included jasper, novaculite, and quartzite. Artifacts were recovered between the
surface and 80 cmbs, with more than half of the artifacts coming from the upper 20 cmbs (Table
6-11).
Refitted sherds from two different vessels were recovered in two different shovel tests at the site.
In Shovel Test TH-454 (18 cmbs), four refitted body sherds were from a plain grog-tempered
vessel, while nine refitted rim sherds in Shovel Test TH-183 (0-20 cmbs) were from a distinctive
and thick (10.8 mm) incised-punctated grog-tempered vessel. This rim was from a band punctated
vessel (Perttula 2013:186 and Figure 4b) of Early Caddo Period age. It had at least two horizontal
incised lines between at least three rows of large curvilinear to vertical punctations (Figure 6-42).
NRHP Eligibility
This site contains intact and relatively undisturbed archeological deposits and may have some

Site 41CS381

Site 41CS381 is a prehistoric lithic scatter that measured 2.1 acres in size (Figure 6-43) located
within the Flatwoods parcel. The site was located on an elevated landform that sloped gradually
to the south towards a low-lying, inundated area and overlooked a drainage to the northeast.
Topographically, the landform was overlain by a series of circular and linear rises. The rises were
oriented northeast to southwest. Elevation was 230 feet AMSL across the site area. According to
the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils are characterized by Eastwood very fine sandy
loam with one to five percent slopes. A typical positive shovel test soil profile consisted of pale
brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam (depth: min=20 cmbs; max=102 cmbs) with sandstone pebbles
underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay. Shovel tests reached a maximum depth of 102 cmbs.
Approximately 40 shovel tests were excavated across the landform, of which 12 had cultural
materials (BN-304, HB-083, HB-084, HB-085, HB-087, HB-088, HB-089, SM-232, SM-234, TH212, TH-216, and TH-218). Artifacts included lithic debitage (n=18) and one piece of FCR. Five
artifacts were recovered from the upper 20 cmbs, 13 from 40-60 cmbs, and five from 60-80 cmbs
(including the fragment of FCR). Lithic raw material among the artifacts consisted of jasper and
quartzite.

Site 41CS382

Site 41CS382 is an Ancestral Caddo occupation site observed on the shore (Figure 6-44) located
within the Flatwoods parcel. Clay was exposed at the surface through wave action and ground
visibility was 100 percent; thus, no shovel tests were excavated along the shore. However, shovel
tests were excavated on the landform to the south of, and above, the shore. These shovel tests
revealed yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth: min=4 cmbs; max=20 cmbs) underlain
by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs.
Elevation along the shoreline was estimated to be 226 feet AMSL. The entire site is situated within
the zone of shoreline erosion.
No artifacts were observed in any of the shovel tests excavated within the vicinity of the site.
However, a visual inspection of the shore resulted in the collection of lithic debitage (n=18), an
arrow point that compares favorably to the Alba type (Figure 6-45) dating to the Formative Period,
and a plain grog-tempered ceramic body sherd. Cultural materials were spread out across an area
measuring 0.33 acre in size. Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site
included Big Fork chert, jasper, novaculite, and quartzite.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive
research potential because of limited archeological content and is considered not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Site 41CS383

Site 41CS383 is an Ancestral Caddo occupation (Figure 6-46) located within the Overcup parcel.
The site, which measured 11.8 acres in size, was located on a stream terrace that overlooked a
large drainage fed by Carlow, Powell, and Douglassville creeks. Topographically, the landform
sloped drastically to the west and was bordered by drainages to the east and north. High spots
were observed across the stream terrace. Within the site, elevation ranged from 252 to 260 feet
AMSL. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils are characterized by
Eastwood very fine sandy loam with one to five percent slopes. A typical positive shovel test soil
profile consisted of brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam (depth: min=7 cmbs; max=70 cmbs) with
sandstone gravels underlain by yellowish-brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam. Shovel tests reached a
maximum depth of 80 cmbs. Situated within an area designated as a park area, the site has been
adversely impacted through mechanical grading evidenced by the presence of push piles and large
ruts.
Seventy (70) shovel tests were excavated across the landform, of which 34 tested positive for
cultural materials (49 percent ubiquity). This number included 18 shovel tests which were dug in
error outside of the USACE project limits, upslope and to the east; five of these were positive.
Overall, artifacts included lithic debitage (n=85), FCR (n=2), a biface, a ground stone fragment, a
projectile point that compares favorably to the Gary type (Figure 6-47) dating to the Woodland
Period, plain grog-tempered ceramic body sherds (n=2; refit), and green vessel glass shards (n=6).
The glass shards were recovered from the upper 20 cm of ST BN-396 and are all very small, thin,
and curved; they appear to be from the same vessel. They are not patinated and non-diagnostic,
making it difficult to assign them to a specific period, but the lack of surface abrasions suggests
they are of recent origin. Coupled with a lack of additional non-prehistoric artifacts, the site was
not considered to have an historic component.

Site 41CS384

Site 41CS384 is a prehistoric lithic scatter measuring 1.07 acres in size (Figure 6-48) located
within the Overcup parcel. Located on a narrow ridge that sloped from northeast to southwest, the
site was bordered by drainages to the east and west. Elevation across the site ranged from 244 to
253 feet AMSL. Soils within the site area are associated with Metcalf silt loam (zero to two percent
slopes; USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests were characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR
5/4) sandy loam (depth: min=35 cmbs; max=75 cmbs) containing sandstone gravels underlain by
yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) to strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests were excavated to a
maximum depth of 75 cmbs.

Site 41CS385

Site 41CS385 is a multi-component site located within the Flatwoods parcel and dating from the
Middle Archaic through the Historic Period (Figure 6-49). The site was located along the north
side of a finger ridge that extended from southwest to northeast. Measuring 8.26 acres in size, the
site’s elevation ranged from 226 to 230 feet AMSL. The landform once overlooked the Sulphur
River, but today is surrounded by the waters of Wright Patman Lake to the east, west, and north.
Soils are associated with the Eastwood very fine sandy loam soil unit (1 to 5 and 5 to 15 percent
slopes) (USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests containing cultural material revealed a soil profile
characterized by light brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam (depth: min=5 cmbs; max=60 cmbs)
underlain by light brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam. Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of
60 cmbs.
During site delineation, 60 shovel tests were excavated along the finger ridge, and 24 tested
positive for cultural materials (40 percent ubiquity). Prehistoric artifacts recovered during shovel
testing consisted of lithic debitage (n=33), a ground stone fragment, biface fragments (n=2), a dart
point that compares favorably to the Neches River type (Figure 6-50B) dating to the Middle
Archaic Period, and ceramic sherds (n=17). Subsurface prehistoric artifacts were recovered
entirely from the upper 40 cmbs, with 43 artifacts in the upper 20 cmbs, and 11 artifacts from 2040 cmbs.
Historic artifacts collected from shovel tests including a fragmented amethyst glass bottle, vessel
glass shards of various colors (amethyst [n=6], aqua [1], brown [n=1], and colorless [ n=5]), clear
window glass shards (n=4), glazed ceramic sherds (n=5), metal hardware (n=10), and a square
nail.
Overall, cultural materials were observed from the surface to a maximum depth of 40 cmbs, with
90 percent of the artifact assemblage recorded in the upper 20 centimeters (Table 6-13). A total
of 106 artifacts were recovered from the excavations including 54 prehistoric artifacts and 52
artifacts dating to the historic period. Lithic raw material among the artifacts consisted of chert,
jasper, novaculite, petrified wood, and quartzite.

cmbs) at Site 41CS385
A) cf. Gary Type; and B) cf. Neches River
Artifacts were also observed on the surface along the northern and western shores and 291 artifacts
were collected from the surface, in two collection areas, along the north-facing shoreline and along
the west-facing portion of the shoreline. Surface-collected items included 31 projectile points, 14
pieces of lithic debitage, five bifaces and lithic tools, 213 prehistoric ceramics, 23 Historic
ceramics, three glass shards, FCR, and a button.
Wave action has eroded the periphery of the finger ridge, exposing clay and creating steep cut
banks. Along the northern shoreline, prehistoric artifacts included dart point fragments (n=2), an
unidentified dart point, and ceramic sherds (n=77), while historic artifacts consisted of a button,
whiteware ceramic sherds (n=1), stoneware ceramic sherds (n=13), a milk glass shard, and
amethyst, clear, and aqua vessel glass shards (n=3). On the western shore, only two historic
ceramic sherds were observed, alongside lithic debitage (n=13), a piece of FCR, bifaces (n=4), a
drill or Jowell knife fragment, dart point fragments (n=14), a dart point that compares favorably to
the Gary type (Figure 6-50A) dating to the Woodland Period, six arrow point fragments and a
variety of arrow points (Figure 6-51) dating to the Late Prehistoric Period, and ceramic sherds
(n=137). Lithic raw material among the artifacts consisted of chert, jasper, novaculite, petrified
wood, and quartzite.

Figure 6-51: Unidentified Arrow Points Recovered from the Surface at Site 41CS385
A total of 231 ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from Site 41CS385 (Table 6-14) from both
surface and shovel test contexts. Almost 94 percent of the sherds were from vessels tempered with
grog and/or various combinations of burned bone or crushed pieces of hematite. Approximately
50 percent of the sherds were from vessels tempered solely with grog, 25 percent were from vessels
manufactured with both grog and hematite tempers, and 14 percent were sherds from vessels
tempered with grog and bone. Only 2 percent of the sherds were from vessels tempered only with
burned bone, and another 4 percent were tempered with bone and hematite. Including those sherds
with grog or hematite temper, approximately 25 percent of them were from vessels with bone
temper. Similarly, sherds with hematite temper, as well as grog or bone, comprised 34 percent of
the Site 41CS385 ceramic vessel sherd assemblage.

Less than eight percent of the sherds collected from Site 41CS385 had decorative elements, and
the plain to decorated sherd ratio was 11.8. All decorated sherds from the site were from utility
ware vessels (Table 6-15). They were from vessels with incised (n=12, 66.7 percent), appliqued
(n=4, 22.2 percent), appliqued-incised (n=1, 5.6 percent), and punctated (n=1, 5.6 percent)
decorative elements. The absence of fine ware sherds in the assemblage, as well as the absence of
sherds from brushed vessels, suggest that the ancestral Caddo ceramics at Site 41CS385 were from
a pre-AD 1200 occupation, before the common use of brushed vessels in East Texas (Perttula
2013). Regnier (2017:188-189) noted that fine ware sherds tend to be uncommon in parts of the
Red River basin before ca. AD 1050, and thus, it is possible that the ancestral Caddo occupation
at Site 41CS385dates before that time, in the Formative Caddo period.

Several of the incised sherds were from Dunkin Incised vessels (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 19),
including body sherds with diagonal opposed and opposed incised lines, as well as a body sherd
with a triangle incised element (see Table 6-15). Two rim sherds were from Davis Incised bowls
with horizontal incised lines (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 18). Several body sherds from jars had
straight or curvilinear appliqued ridges that were placed on the vessel body. One of these sherds
had diagonal incised lines that started at the appliqued ridge. These sherds have not been identified
to type, but perhaps they are a simpler variety of Hollyknowe Ridge Pinched, an Early Caddoperiod type (Webb and McKinney 1975:84). The remaining decorated sherd in the Site 41CS385
assemblage was a body sherd with a row of distinctive large and elongated tool punctations.
Several such sherds were also present in the decorated sherd assemblage from Site 41CS386 (see
Chapter 7).

Features
In addition to cultural material, archeologists recorded six features, including four brick scatters,
a scatter of burned sandstone, and a subsurface midden deposit containing a dense concentration
of historic artifacts.
Feature 1 was a brick scatter measuring three meters in diameter, surrounding the remains of a
chimney base that measured approximately 60 by 87 centimeters in size. Only the bottommost
course of bricks from the chimney box remained in situ; the other bricks were disarticulated,
broken, and scattered around the intact chimney base (Figure 6-52).

Figure 6-52: Feature 1 Brick Scatter, Site 41CS385
The bricks were standard size (2.5 x 4 x 8 inches), solid, machine-made, and were composed of
highly fired orange and red paste and stamped with the Atlanta Texas maker’s mark. The Atlanta
Brick Company was in operation from roughly the beginning of the twentieth century (Figure 653). It closed when building slowed after World War II (Ancestry.com 2018a). This means that
the chimney base likely dates to between the 1880s. and World War II.

Figure 6-53: Atlanta Brick Company Advertisement

Feature 2 was similar to Feature 1, also a circular brick scatter composed of shaped sandstone,
Atlanta Texas bricks, and a machine-made, yellow, paste brick stamped with an incomplete
maker’s mark reading “…UIS”. The scatter is northeast of Feature 1 and measured four meters in
diameter.
Feature 3 was a midden deposit documented within Shovel Test BN-447. It was characterized by
very dark, grayish-brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam containing a high density of historic artifacts
(n=26) but also with a few prehistoric artifacts (n=4) between zero and 20 cmbs. Artifacts
recovered from BN-447 included a plain grog-tempered prehistoric ceramic sherd, lithic debitage
(n=3), nails and/or tacks (n=8), whiteware sherds (n=6), a glazed earthenware sherd, amethyst
vessel glass (n=6), and colorless vessel glass (n-4). The midden deposit is likely associated with
the demolished brick structure represented by Features 1, 2, 4, and 5.

Features 4 and 5 are additional scatters of Atlanta Texas bricks similar to Features 1 and 2. Feature
4 is southeast of Feature 1 and measures three meters in diameter; it is likely chimney fall
associated with Feature 1. Feature 5 measured two meters in diameter and was a fourth scatter of
Atlanta Texas and shaped sandstone bricks located south of Feature 2. Features 2, 4, and 5 are
likely push-piles of bricks created when the chimney was demolished, post-1951.
Finally, Feature 6 was a scatter of burned sandstone and clay that eroded to the surface. The
feature, which was located at the base of a tree, measured two meters in diameter (Figure 6-54).
No artifacts or bricks were observed in association with this feature.

Historic Research
Although separately delineated spatially, this site is part of the same historic occupation as reported
above for 41CS105. A review of USGS topographic maps from 1908 do not show any structures
located at this site (see Figure 6-15). However, the map indicates that the site was located along
a road that crossed the Sulphur River at a locale called the Bobo Bridge. James Bobo was a resident
and one of the pioneering families of Cass County. He came to east Texas with his parents and
extended family (the Elias White family) in 1846. Their headright patents were in Bowie County,
although over time, some members of the Bobo family settled in Cass County on the south side of
the Sulphur River. James Bobo died in 1903 and is buried in the Antioch Cemetery, a few miles
south of Wright Patman Lake (Findagrave.com 2018b).

Deed research at Site 41CS385, shows no connection to the Bobo family (unless that connection
pre-dates 1875) (see Table 6-5). The United States acquired the property from Nancy Louise
(“Lou”) Wilson in 1951, the wife of J.D. Wilson. The Wilson family owned the property since
1917, having purchased it from well-known local merchants, A.D. Morriss and J.G. King, who
operated a store in Munz City (Alford 2010). The Wilsons and the Morriss and King families had
done business together previously. In July of 1917, Morriss and King also sold the Wilson family
property near Knight’s Bluff, where Site 41CS125 is located. However, the Wilson family only
owned that property for three years before selling it back to A.B. Morriss (A.D’s son). It is possible
that J.D. Wilson and his family lived on the Old Bobo Road property, as both J.D. and Lou are
buried in the Old Liberty Cemetery, just north of Antioch. Lou died in 1965, while J.D. died in
1936 (Findagrave.com 2018c).
Morriss and King (who were brothers-in-law) purchased the property from brothers J.H. and A.H.
Snipes, who had in turn purchased the property from R.B. McWhorter in 1902. It should be noted
that J.H. Snipes was also Abner Darden Morriss’s brother-in-law by marriage to his sister. Neither
of these individuals likely lived on this tract, as they owned property all over Cass and Bowie
counties. Moreover, deed records from other sites around Wright Patman Lake indicate that the
Snipes brothers, R.B. McWhorter, and Morriss and King swapped properties extensively
throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Sitters and Perttula 2018).
McWhorter acquired the property from John Cherry, whose family had owned it since at least
1875. Catherine Cherry is listed in the 1880 Census for this general area of Cass County as a 59year-old widow, living with her sons John (26), Richard (17), George (9), and a black boarder
named Isaac (13). However, it is not clear whether she lived on this tract or elsewhere.
The brick chimney remnant of Site 41CS385 most likely dates to the period during which the
Wilson family owned the property (1917 to 1951). The Atlanta Brick Company bricks that made
up the chimney ruin were highly-fired, machine-made bricks that appeared to post-date the
beginning of the twentieth century. Moreover, the Atlanta Brick Company did not begin
operations until the late 1880s at the earliest. Furthermore, no structures are depicted at this
location on the 1908 topographical map, suggesting that the home that was once at this site also
post-dates that time. The home would have been right on Bobo Bridge Road and may have been
occupied by the Wilson family. Very little information is available about J.D. or Lou Wilson.
They are not listed in census records for any year in Bowie or Cass counties. However, the 1900
Census does list a T.J. Wilson family in this area. A death certificate for Nancy Louise Wilson
from 1965 indicates she died in Atlanta, Cass County (Ancestry.com 2018b). Both Lou and J.D.
are buried in the nearby Liberty Cemetery, suggesting that both lived and died in the Site 41CS105
vicinity.
NRHP Eligibility
Overall, this site appears to have research potential and warrants protection and avoidance until
test excavations can be conducted to determine if it meets the criteria specified in 36 CFR Part
60.4 of the NRHP.

Site 41CS386

Site 41CS386 is a prehistoric occupation site dating from the Woodland Period through Ancestral
Caddo times (Figure 6-55). The site, which encompassed 19 acres, ranged in elevation from 226
to 233 feet AMSL. Located within the Flatwoods parcel, the site was characterized by a northwest
to southeast linear ridge that was eroded through wave action along its edges. Additionally,
fluctuations in the lake’s water level resulted in an uneven surface consisting of high and low spots.
The site was bordered on three sides (north, east, and west) by Wright Patman Lake. According
to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), the landform is overlain by Eastwood very fine
sandy loam (1 to 5 and 5 to 15 percent slopes). Shovel tests containing cultural material revealed
a soil profile characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) to dark yellowish-brown (10YR 4/4)
sandy loam (depth: min=22 cmbs; max=102 cmbs) underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay.
Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of 102 cmbs.
During site delineation, 78 shovel tests were excavated along the landform, and 58 tested positive
for cultural materials (74 percent ubiquity). A total of 335 artifacts and samples were recovered
from the shovel tests including lithic debitage (n=71), ground stone (n=2), tested pebbles (n=2), a
biface, an arrow point (Figure 6-56C), burned clay, ceramic sherds (n=131), unidentified faunal
remains (n=2), charred organic material, and many freshwater mussel shell fragments. Cultural
materials were recovered from the surface to a maximum depth of 80 cmbs. However, most
artifacts are shallowly buried; excluding 86 pieces of freshwater shell collected from ST TH-378
at 40-60 cmbs, almost 50 percent of subsurface material was recovered from the upper 20 cmbs
and more than 76 percent was from the upper 40 cmbs. (Table 6-16). Only five of the 58 positive
tests yielded more than 10 items each. Excluding the shell in ST TH-378, at 48 total items, ST
BN-458 was the densest assemblage having 29 ceramic sherds, 13 bone fragments, three lithics
and three shell fragments.
Investigators also observed artifacts along the shoreline and collected 424 additional artifacts.
Items collected from the surface included lithic debitage (100+), modified flakes (n=4), a biface,
biface fragments (n=5), ground stone, a perforator (Figure 6-56B), a shaft straightener (Figure 656A), dart points that compare favorably to the Gary type (n=5; Figure 6-56C-E) dating to the
Woodland Period, ceramic sherds (n=329), a Red River pipe fragment, unidentified faunal remains
(n=30; Figure 6-57), and freshwater mussel shell.

Features
Four features were also recorded at Site 41CS386, consisting of three shell middens and one human
burial.
Feature 1 was a shell midden that eroded out of a cut bank along the site’s western shore (Figure
6-58). The cut bank ranged in height from 70 to 120 centimeters, and at the time of survey, the
shoreline ranged in width from two to four meters (Figure 6-59). Portions of the shell midden
were still intact and visible within the cut bank. The eroded shell midden deposits encompassed
an area measuring 10 (north to south) by 4 (east to west) meters in size. Artifacts present within
the shell midden included lithic debitage, lithic tools (e.g., perforator and edge modified flakes),
ground stone, dart points, unidentified faunal remains, decorated and undecorated ceramic sherds,
and a Red River Pipe fragment (Figure 6-60). A sample of artifacts were collected from Feature
1.

Feature 2 was another, but smaller and less dense, shell midden (Figure 6-61). This shell midden
measured approximately 3 (north to south) by 1 meter (east to west) in size and was located
approximately 30 meters to the south of Feature 1. No components of the shell midden were
observed within the cut bank. Artifacts associated with Feature 2 included lithic debitage, ground
stone, a dart point, decorated and undecorated ceramic sherds, mussel shell, and unidentified faunal
remains. A sample of artifacts from Feature 2 were collected.

Figure 6-61: Feature 2 Shell Midden, Site 41CS386
Feature 3 was a human burial (Figure 6-62). The burial was situated within the cut bank at a depth
of approximately 40 cmbs. Located roughly 12 meters south of Feature 2, the burial consisted of
human remains and two ceramic vessels. An initial assessment of the burial suggested that most
of the skeleton, with the exception of the cranium and lower jaw, had previously eroded into the
lake. The ceramic vessels consisted of a plain bottle and a bowl with a decorative motif that
compares favorably to Barkman engraved (Figure 6-63). Mixed with the burial fill were ceramic
sherds and a projectile point that compares favorably to the Gary type. At the time of recording,
the burial and associated funerary items (e.g., vessels) were in danger of eroding out of the cut
bank. Within weeks of the burial’s recording, heavy rainfall inundated the burial.

Feature 4 was a buried shell midden. The midden measured approximately 25 (north to south) by
20 (east to west) meters in size and was encountered between the surface and 60 cmbs. The shell
midden was characterized by a high density of freshwater mussel shell, unidentified faunal
remains, lithic debitage, and ceramic sherds within a black (10YR 2/1), greasy sandy loam. Shovel
Tests BN-458, SM-379 TH-335, TH-378, and TH-382 were excavated in the midden deposits.
Within and adjacent to (or west of) the midden, investigators observed numerous looter pits. These
pits were large, measuring up to three meters in length, and at least one meter in width. They
appeared old in age and were likely dug in search of burials.
NRHP Eligibility
On the basis of demonstrated integrity and archaeological content, Site 41CS386 warrants
inclusion in the NRHP. This site should be avoided, preserved, and protected.

6.31

Site 41CS387

Site 41CS387 is a prehistoric lithic scatter measuring 0.28 acre in size (Figure 6-64) located within
the Overcup parcel. Located on a narrow ridge that sloped from northeast to southwest, the site
was bordered by drainages to the east and west. Elevation across the site ranged from 242 to 251
feet AMSL. Soils within the site area are associated with Eastwood very fine sandy loam with 5
to 15 percent slopes and Metcalf silt loam with 0 to 2 percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive
shovel tests were characterized by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth: min= 21 cmbs;
max=50 cmbs) with gravels underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests were
excavated to a maximum depth of 60 cmbs.
Archeologists excavated 30 shovel tests across the narrow ridge; six contained artifacts (BN-465,
BN-466, BN-467, SM-350, TH-341, and TH-343). Cultural materials recovered during shovel
testing consisted solely of lithic debitage (n=8). All artifacts were recovered between the surface
and 20 cmbs. Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site included jasper,
novaculite, and quartzite.

Site 41CS388

Site 41CS388 is a prehistoric lithic scatter (Figure 6-65) located within the Overcup parcel. The
site, which measured 5.68 acres in size, was located along an upland ridge that sloped drastically
to the west towards a large drainage fed by Carlow, Powell, and Douglassville creeks.
Topographically, the site was characterized by a prominent east to west ridge, with sporadic high
spots. Elevation ranged from 249 to 273 feet AMSL. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil
Survey (2018), soils are characterized by Bowie fine sandy loam with one to five percent slopes.
A typical positive shovel test soil profile consisted of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam containing
gravels (depth: min=40 cmbs; max=100 cmbs) underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Large
push piles and mechanically-stripped surfaces were observed at the eastern end of the site. Shovel
tests terminated at a maximum depth of 100 cmbs.
Fifty-six (56) shovel tests were excavated across the landform, of which 23 tested positive for
cultural materials (Table 6-17). Artifacts included lithic debitage (n=67), FCR (n=2), a biface,
and a shard of green vessel glass. The glass shard was not patinated and non-diagnostic, making
it difficult to assign it to a specific period. Coupled with a lack of other historic artifacts, the site
is not considered to have a historic component. Cultural material was observed from the surface
to a maximum depth of 80 cmbs, normally distributed with a moderate peak at 20-40 cmbs. Lithic
raw material among the artifacts consisted of jasper, novaculite, and quartzite.
NRHP Eligibility

Site 41CS389

Site 41CS389 is a multi-component, prehistoric site located within the Overcup parcel and
spanning from the Woodland Period into the Late Prehistoric (Figure 6-66). The site was situated
along a narrow ridge that sloped from northeast to southwest towards the lake. The landform was
bordered on both sides by drainages. With an elevation of 230 to 240 feet AMSL, the landform is
overlain by Bernaldo fine sandy loam (zero to three percent slopes), Socagee silty clay loam (zero
to one percent slopes), and Wrightsville silt loam (zero to one percent slopes) (USDA-NRCS
2018). Shovel tests containing cultural material revealed a soil profile characterized by yellowishbrown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth: min=20 cmbs; max=85 cmbs) with sandstone gravels
underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of 85
cmbs.

Archeologists excavated 37 shovel tests across the landform, of which 21 contained artifacts (57
percent ubiquity). Cultural materials recovered during shovel testing consisted of lithic debitage
(n=26), FCR, a dart point that compares favorably to the Gary type (Figure 6-67A) dating to the
Woodland Period, an unidentified arrow point (Figure 6-67B) dating to the Late Prehistoric
Period, and a plain grog-tempered ceramic body sherd. Artifacts were documented between the
surface and 80 cmbs (Table 6-18), with the majority in the upper 40 cmbs. Lithic raw material
among the artifacts consisted of jasper, novaculite, and quartzite.

Site 41CS390

Site 41CS390 is a prehistoric lithic scatter measuring 0.19 acre in size (Figure 6-68) located within
the Overcup parcel. Located on a stream terrace that sloped gradually to the south, the site was
bordered by a drainage to the east and a low-lying area to the west. Elevation across the site ranged
from 230 to 237 feet AMSL. Soils within the site area are associated with the Bernaldo fine sandy
loam (zero to three percent slopes) (USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests were characterized
by yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (depth: min=47 cmbs; max=80 cmbs) containing
sandstone gravels underlain by (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth
of 90 cmbs.
Ten (10) shovel tests were excavated across the stream terrace, of which four had cultural materials
(BN-508, BN-509, BN-510, and TH-372). Cultural materials recovered during shovel testing
consisted of jasper and novaculite lithic debitage (n=5). Of the five items recovered, three were
from 0-20 cmbs, one was from 20-40 cmbs, and one was from 60-80 cmbs (ST TH-372).
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive

Site 41CS391

Site 41CS391 is Ancestral Caddo occupation site located within the Overcup parcel on a stream
terrace that sloped gradually to the south and west (Figure 6-69). The site measured 1.23 acres in
size, with an elevation ranging from 244 to 262 feet AMSL. Soils within the site area consist of
Latex fine sandy loam with one to three percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). A typical positive
shovel test soil profile consisted of yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy
loam (depth: min= 50 cmbs; max= 68 cmbs) underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel
tests reached a maximum depth of 70 cmbs.
Fifteen (15) shovel tests were excavated within the site area, seven of which tested positive for
cultural materials (BN-511, BN-512, BN-513, BN-547, DS-188, DS-189, and TH-375). Artifacts
included lithic debitage (n=7) and a single grog-tempered fine ware body sherd from an ancestral
Caddo carinated bowl of post-AD 800 age. The sherd had diagonal engraved lines drawn from
left to right along the rim panel of the vessel. Two items were recovered from the upper 20 cmbs,
three from 20-40 cmbs (including the sherd), and three from 40-60 cmbs. Raw materials used in
the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site included chert, novaculite, and quartzite.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive

Site 41CS392

Site 41CS392 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located within the Flatwoods parcel and situated along
a stream terrace that overlooked a drainage to the west (Figure 6-70). Elevated at about 230 feet
AMSL, the site measured 0.87 acre in size. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey
(2018), soils within the site consist of Eastwood very fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent slopes.
Positive shovel tests encountered yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam and light brownishgray (10YR 6/2) silt loam underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests extended to
a maximum depth of 75 cmbs.
Archeologists excavated more than nine shovel tests along the stream terrace of which four
contained cultural materials (BN-568, DS-187, DS-205, and SM-402). Artifacts recovered during
shovel testing consisted of novaculite and quartzite lithic debitage (n=7). Cultural materials were
roughly evenly distributed vertically between 0 and 50 cmbs.

Site 41CS394

Site 41CS394 is a multi-component site dating from the Ancestral Caddo to Historic times (Figure
6-72). Located within the Flatwoods parcel across an undulating stream terrace, the site measured
1.77 acres in size. With an elevation ranging from 228 to 230 feet AMSL, the landform was
underlain by Eastwood very fine sandy loam with one to five percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018).
Shovel tests containing cultural material revealed a soil profile characterized by yellowish-brown
(10YR 5/4) and dark yellowish-brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam underlain by strong brown (7.5YR
5/6) clay. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 100 cmbs.
Thirteen (13) shovel tests were excavated throughout the site area, nine of which contained cultural
materials (BN-573, BN-574, BN-575, BN-578, BN-579, SM-427, TH-411, TH-413, and TH-414)
(Table 6-19). The prehistoric artifact assemblage consisted of lithic debitage (n=11) composed of
jasper, novaculite, and quartzite, and a plain body-base ceramic sherd from a grog-hematitetempered vessel. Prehistoric artifacts were widely distributed between 0-60 cmbs.
Historic artifacts recovered from the site included colorless vessel glass (n=4), window glass (n=6),
a glazed ceramic sherd, a whiteware ceramic sherds (n=2), metal hardware, square nails (n=4), and
wire nails (n=6). Two fragments of unidentified bone were recovered between 0-20 cmbs from
Shovel Test TH-411, which also contained window glass. All historic artifacts were recovered
from the upper 40 cmbs, with the majority (21 artifacts out of 26 artifacts) within the upper 20
cmbs.

Features
Three historic-age features were observed at this site including two circular depressions and one
mounded concentration of shaped sandstone and mortar.
Feature 1 was a large, circular, earthen depression measuring approximately 3.6 meters in diameter
and one meter deep (Figure 6-73). Functional interpretation of the feature is uncertain.
Feature 2 consisted of a slightly mounded scatter of shaped sandstone and mortar fragments
located on the east side of an ephemeral two-track road (Figure 6-74). The feature measured 3.7
meters (north to south) by 3.3 meters (east to west) and stood 50 to 70 centimeters tall. Functional
interpretation of the feature is uncertain.
Feature 3 was a second circular earthen depression that measured approximately 2.5 by 2.3 meters
in size and 50 centimeters deep (Figure 6-75). Functional interpretation of the feature is uncertain.

Historic Research
The 1910 USGS topographic map of the site shows a house at this location situated on the road
from Douglassville leading to Bobo Bridge (Figure 6-76). The Historic Period remains at Site
41CS394 likely represent that former farmstead. Deed research shows a fairly stable history of
ownership for the property. Deeds traced back to 1858 indicate that J.H. McCoy purchased the
property from William Finley in 1858 (Table 6-20). Both the McCoy and Finley families were
longtime and early residents of Cass County. The 1860 Agriculture Census lists W.J. Finley and
J.H. McCoy as neighbors. In 1860, McCoy had 20 acres of improved land and 600 acres of
unimproved land, while Finley had 30 acres of improved and 290 acres of unimproved land
(Ancestry.com 2018c). Henry McCoy, J.H.’s father (or grandfather) is listed in the 1860 slave
schedule as having 26 enslaved black laborers on his farm. The McCoy and Finley family names
continue to appear in the censuses through 1910 for this area. Members of the McCoy family are
buried in the Union Chapel Cemetery in Douglassville (Findagrave.com 2018d).

Notes
173.22 acres in Haas
and Aaron Surveys
-

The fact that many of the nails found were cut nails, as opposed to wire nails, suggest a pre-1880s
construction date for this homesite. This is consistent with deed history and other archival sources
that suggest the Finley and McCoy families were neighbors and residents of Cass County from the
mid-nineteenth century. The remains at Site 41CS394 are related to the Finley or McCoy families,
both of which had settled in this area before the 1860s.
NRHP Eligibility
Overall, this site appears to have research potential and warrants protection and avoidance until
test excavations can be conducted to determine if it meets the criteria specified in 36 CFR Part
60.4 of the NRHP.

Site 41CS395

Site 41CS395 is a historic-age site measuring 0.1 acre in size (Figure 6-77) located within the
Flatwoods parcel. The site was situated near the center of a broad stream terrace that was bordered
by drainages to the east and west. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), site
soils consist of Eastwood very fine sandy loam with one to five percent slopes. Positive shovel
tests encountered yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6)
clay. Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of 58 cmbs.
Archeologists excavated eight shovel tests during the delineation of Site 41CS395, only two of
which tested positive for cultural materials (BN-580 and DS-210). Artifacts included colorless
vessel glass (n=2), window glass (n=2), and eight iron nails. All artifacts were recovered from the
upper 20 cmbs.
In addition, two brick fragments were observed on the surface adjacent to Shovel Test SM-427.
The orange and red paste brick fragments were machine-made with no evidence of maker’s marks.
These brick fragments are unlike those observed on sites 41CS105 and 41CS385.
Features
One feature was recorded at the site. Feature 1 was a circular earthen depression measuring 2.5
meters in diameter and about one meter deep (Figure 6-78). Functional interpretation of the
feature is uncertain, but given its proximity to Site 41CS394, this feature may be related to it as
part of the same household.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. However, deed research
indicated that Site 41CS395 is likely associated with Site 41CS394. Therefore, testing is
recommended to determine the relationship between these sites and to determine NRHP eligibility.

Site 41CS396

Site 41CS396 is prehistoric lithic scatter site located within the Flatwoods parcel at the southern
end of a stream terrace that overlooked a drainage to the east (Figure 6-79). The site measured
0.1 acre in size and sat at an elevation of 230 feet AMSL. The stream terrace is underlain by
Eastwood very fine sandy loam with 1 to 5 and 5 to 15 percent slopes (USDA-NRCS 2018). A
typical positive shovel test soil profile consisted of very dark grayish-brown (10YR 3/2) sandy
loam underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests reached a maximum depth of 10
cmbs.
Eight shovel tests were excavated along the stream terrace; two contained cultural materials (BN588 and BN-589). Buried artifacts included lithic debitage (n=2) composed of quartzite. Both
artifacts were recovered in the upper 10 cmbs.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive
research potential because of limited archeological content and is considered not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Site 41CS397

Site 41CS397 is a Woodland Period lithic scatter with an Ancestral Caddo component that
measured 4.1 acres in size (Figure 6-80). The site is located within the Flatwoods parcel on a
stream terrace that overlooks the Sulphur River channel to the north, which is now Wright Patman
Lake. Artifacts were also documented on the shore, below a heavily-eroded cut bank (Figure 681). Clay was exposed at the surface through wave action; thus, no shovel tests were excavated
along the shore. A public recreation area, labeled Pine Bluff on topographic maps, was located
above and to the south of the site. Mechanical scraping was evident across the western half of the
Pine Bluff recreation area. Shovel tests excavated within this portion of the recreation area
revealed yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam (depth: min=5 cmbs; max=31 cmbs) underlain
by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests in the recreation area reached a maximum depth
of 35 cmbs. Shovel tests excavated within the eastern half of the site were characterized by mottled
red (2.5YR 4/8) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Here, shovel tests terminated at a maximum
depth of 10 cmbs. Elevation along the shoreline was estimated to be 226 feet AMSL, while along
the stream terrace elevation reached 232 feet AMSL.
Fourteen shovel tests were excavated along the stream terrace, of which only four tested positive
for cultural materials (BN-593, DS-212, DS-213, and DS-215). These tests each yielded a single
lithic artifact from the upper 20 cmbs; three were debitage and the fourth was an untyped dart point
from ST DS-215. Materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site included jasper,
novaculite, and quartzite.
A visual inspection of the shore resulted in the recovery of lithic debitage (n=39), flake cores (n=2),
FCR, a biface, ground stone, untyped dart points (Figure 6-82A-B), a projectile point that
compares favorably to the Gary type (Figure 6-82D) dating to the Woodland Period, and ceramic
sherds (n=5). The ceramic sherds were all from grog-tempered vessels. Two were rim sherds with
horizontal incised lines, perhaps from Davis Incised or Coles Creek Incised vessels of Formative
to Early Caddo Period age (ca. A.D. 850-1200). The other three sherds included two plain body
sherds and one plain body-base sherd.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive
research potential because of limited archeological content and is considered not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Site 41CS398

Site 41CS398 is a Woodland Period occupation site located within the Overcup parcel measuring
0.53 acre in size (Figure 6-83). The site, which sloped gradually to the west, was bordered by
drainages to the north and south. With elevations ranging from 240 to 244 feet AMSL, the site is
overlain by Latex fine sandy loam with one to three percent slopes (USGS-NRCS 2018). Positive
shovel tests encountered yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam underlain by strong brown
(7.5Yr 5/6) clay. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 60 cmbs.
Thirteen (13) shovel tests were excavated on the landform and six of these contained cultural
materials (BN-596, BN-599, BN-602, TH-425, TH-426, and TH-427). Artifacts consisted of lithic
debitage (n=11), tested cobbles (n=3), and a dart point that compares favorably to the Gary type,
dating to the Woodland Period. Nine items were recovered from 0-20 cmbs and six items were
recovered from 20-40 cmbs (including the projectile point from ST TH-427). Lithic raw material
among the artifacts consisted of jasper, novaculite, and quartzite.
NRHP Eligibility
This site has poor contextual integrity and/or evidence of disturbances. It lacks substantive
research potential because of limited archeological content and is considered not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Site 41CS399

Site 41CS399 is a Woodland Period site located within the Overcup parcel that measured
approximately 2.33 acres in size and was situated to the southeast and downslope from Site
41CS388 (Figure 6-84). Located on a narrow ridge that sloped from north to south towards the
lake, the site was bordered by a low-lying area to the west and a drainage to the east. Elevation
across the site ranged from 226 to 246 feet AMSL. Soils within the site area are associated with
Eastwood very fine sandy loam (5 to 15 percent slopes, USDA-NRCS 2018). Positive shovel tests
were characterized by very dark grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam (depth: min=30 cmbs;
max=80 cmbs) with gravels underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam. Shovel tests
reached a maximum depth of 80 cmbs.
During the delineation of Site 41CS399, 15 shovel tests were excavated within the site area, all of
which tested positive for cultural materials (BN-481, BN-482, BN-483, BN-484, DS-149, DS-150,
DS-151, DS-152, DS-153, SM-357, SM-358, SM-359, TH-355, TH-356, and TH-357). Artifacts
consisted of lithic debitage (n=38) and one ground stone fragment. Artifacts were recovered from
the surface to a maximum depth of 80 cmbs, but were strongly concentrated in the upper 20 cmbs.
(Table 6-21).
In addition, artifacts were observed on the surface of the southernmost shore. In this area, artifacts
consisted of lithic debitage (n=55) and two dart points, one of which compares favorably to the
Gary type, dating to the Woodland Period; the second point was incomplete. Raw materials used
in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site included jasper, novaculite, and quartzite.
NRHP Eligibility
This site contains intact and relatively undisturbed archeological deposits and may have some
research potential. This site warrants test excavations to determine its NRHP eligibility.

Isolated Finds

During the survey at Wright Patman Lake, 10 Isolated Finds were documented (Table 6-22) that
did not meet the requirements for site designation (see Section 4.2.2). Tests DS-069 and SM-095
are 8m apart, do not meet site criteria, and are considered as separate IFs. Isolated Finds included
lithic debitage (n=10), a projectile point that compares favorably to the Palmillas type (Figure 685) dating to the Late Archaic Period, and an amber colored vessel glass shard.

Chapter 7 – Site 41CS386 Ceramic Analysis
7.1

Ceramic Vessels

Two virtually complete ancestral Caddo ceramic vessels from a single ancestral Caddo burial were
recovered from the eroded shoreline/cutbank at Site 41CS386. One was a Barkman Engraved
bowl and the other was a plain bottle of uncertain type.

7.2

Ceramic Vessel Sherds

There were 458 ceramic vessel sherds and a ceramic plug with a drilled hole in the collections
from Site 41CS386. This included 129 sherds from shovel tests, nine sherds in the immediate
proximity to the Feature 3 burial (including below the burial in the cutbank, three labeled Burial:
B, and one sherd on the shoreline), and 320 sherds from surface collections along the shoreline
(n=55), Feature 1 shell midden (including the clay plug) (n=248), and Feature 2 shell midden
(n=18).
The density of ceramic vessel sherds in the 29 shovel tests with sherds ranged from 1-29, with a
mean density of 4.45 per positive shovel test; this is ca. 35.6 ceramic sherds per square meter of
archeological deposits, and the sherds were present from 0-80 cm bs. The shovel tests with the
highest densities of sherds were BN 458 (n=29), TH 384 (n=20), and TH 382 (n=11).
More than 99 percent of the ceramic vessel sherds from Site 41CS386 were from vessels made
with grog temper (Table 7-1); about 81.5 percent of the sherds were solely tempered with grog,
and the remainder were tempered with bone and/or hematite. About 0.9 percent of the sherds were
from vessels tempered with bone or bone-hematite, and only 5.9 percent of all the sherds are from
vessels that were tempered with bone and/or other temper inclusions (primarily grog). The highest
proportion of bone-tempered vessels were in the plain ware and utility ware sherds (5.8-6.8
percent). The use of crushed hematite as a temper in the Site 41CS386 vessel sherds comprised
13.7 percent of the assemblage as a whole, either in combination with grog (12.7 percent), with
grog and bone (0.4 percent), or with burned bone (0.7 percent). The use of hematite as a temper
was most common in the plain ware (16.2 percent) and utility ware (14.3 percent); only 6.0 percent
of the fine ware sherds were from vessels made with hematite temper.

Approximately 78 percent of the 304 decorated sherds in the Site 41CS386 assemblage were from
utility ware vessels (i.e., with wet paste decorations); 71 percent of the rim sherds were from utility
ware vessels. The remainder (22 percent of the assemblage and 29 percent of the rim sherds) were
from fine ware vessels with engraved, engraved-punctated, or excised punctated decorative
methods (Table 7-2).

Among the utility wares, approximately 65 percent of the sherds (and 50 percent of the decorated
sherd assemblage) were from vessels with incised decorative elements. Sherds with brushing
marks accounted for another 8.4 percent of the utility wares, followed by sherds with incisedpunctated elements (7.2 percent), appliqued-incised elements (5.1 percent), and punctated
elements (4.6 percent) (Table 7-2). More than 95 percent of the fine ware sherds from Site
41CS386 had engraved elements, and the remainder had engraved-punctated (3.0 percent) and
excised (1.5 percent) elements.
The appliqued, appliqued-incised, and appliqued-punctated sherds comprised 9.0 percent of the
utility ware sherds in the Site 41CS386 assemblage. These had curvilinear, straight, and vertical
appliqued ridges on vessel bodies, as well as associated incised lines or tool punctated rows (Table
7-2). The appliqued-incised and appliqued-punctated sherds were all likely from Pease BrushedIncised vessels, with panels defined by appliqued ridges, and the panels left either plain or filled
with incised lines or punctations (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 60), while the appliqued body sherds
may be from McKinney Plain vessels (Suhm and Jelks 1962:97 and Plate 49).
About 11 percent of the utility ware sherds had brushing marks, brushed-appliqued elements,
brushed-incised marks and lines, and brushed-punctated elements (Table 7-2). Rim sherds had
horizontal brushed marks, while vessel bodies had opposed or parallel (likely vertical in
orientation) brushing marks. The one brushed-appliqued body sherd was from a Pease BrushedIncised vessel that had a straight appliqued ridge that likely divided the vessel body into panels
filled with brushing marks. The brushed-incised sherds had either parallel or opposed brushing
marks with associated incised lines. Another Pease Brushed-Incised body sherd in the assemblage

April 2019

Page 212

A Cultural Resource Survey of 1,874 Acres at Sam Rayburn Reservoir and Wright Patman Lake, Texas

had parallel to curvilinear brushed marks and a row of tool punctations pushed through the
brushing.
The rim sherds with incised lines in the Site 41CS386 assemblage primarily had horizontal or
diagonal lines (Table 7-2), along with diagonal opposed lines, horizontal-diagonal lines, and one
rim with horizontal incised lines and an associated triangular incised element (Figure 7-1b). These
were likely from both Davis Incised and Dunkin Incised vessels (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plates 18
and 19), although some Pease Brushed-Incised vessels also had diagonal opposed incised lines on
the rim (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 60i).
Incised body sherds had parallel lines, diagonal opposed lines (Figure 7-1c-d), opposed lines, and
horizontal incised lines (Table 7-2). These also were likely to be from Davis Incised and Dunkin
Incised vessels, but Pease Brushed-Incised vessels also had sets of diagonal opposed incised lines
on the vessel body (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 60i, k). Other body sherds in the assemblage had
cross-hatched lines and parallel-diagonal incised lines (Figure 7-1a).

Figure 7-1: Selected Incised Rim and Body Sherds from Site 41CS386
The incised-punctated rim and body sherds from Site 41CS386 had a diverse range of decorative
elements (Table 7-2). Two of the rims had diagonal or diagonal opposed incised lines with zones
or rows of tool punctations (Figure 7-2b), another had vertical incised lines and diagonal tool
punctated rows, and two others had horizontal incised lines with either a tool punctated row at the
rim-body juncture, or with tool punctations between the incised lines; these latter two rims are

Site 41CS386 Ceramic Analysis

likely from Pease Brushed-Incised vessels, as are the rims with diagonal incised lines and rows of
tool punctations.
Body sherds with horizontal or parallel incised lines and adjacent tool punctated rows or zones
were also from Pease Brushed-Incised vessels (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 60c-d). One body sherd
had a row of tool punctations between horizontal incised lines, and was also from a Pease BrushedIncised vessel (Figure 7-2c) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 60e, g). Another incised-punctated body
sherd had diagonal opposed incised lines on either side of a triangular zone filled with tool
punctations (Figure 7-2a). This may be from a Maydelle Incised jar.
One body sherd from Site 41CS386 was from a vessel with parallel incised lines, a tool punctated
zone between the incised lines, and a curvilinear appliqued ridge. This sherd was likely from a
Pease Brushed-Incised jar.

Figure 7-2: Selected Incised-Punctated Rim and Body Sherds from Site 41CS386
About 2.5 percent of the utility ware sherds were from the grog-tempered variety of Nash Neck
Banded (Perttula 2017:24), a common utility ware in post-AD 1400 Texarkana-phase sites in the
Red and Sulphur River basins (Perttula 2018). Sherds with punctated elements accounted for 4.6
percent of the Site 41CS386 utility wares, and most of these had rows of tool punctations on the
rim and body (n=9) rather than fingernail punctations (n=2). Three of the tool punctated sherds
April 2019

Page 214

A Cultural Resource Survey of 1,874 Acres at Sam Rayburn Reservoir and Wright Patman Lake, Texas

had distinctive elongated tool punctations (Table 7-2); similar elongated tool punctated sherds
were present in the Site 41CS386 decorated sherd assemblage.
One utility ware rim sherd was from a McKinney Plain vessel with a roughened rim surface (Suhm
and Jelks 1962:Plate 49). Instead of a row of punctations at the rim-body juncture, this rim sherd
had a single horizontal incised line at the rim-body juncture.
The engraved fine ware rim sherds (n=12) from Site 41CS386 were from bowls and carinated
bowls. Most had at least two horizontal engraved lines, and three rim sherds had horizontal
engraved lines and narrow vertical hatched zones (Table 7-2); these latter rim sherds were from
Barkman Engraved vessels (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 4), while the rims with horizontal engraved
lines could be from several different types, including Barkman Engraved. Another rim, likely
from a Friendship Engraved vessel (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 23), had diagonal opposed
engraved lines (one with a pendant triangle element) besides a large cross-hatched triangle element
(Figure 7-3d), and the last rim had horizontal and triangular engraved lines with hatched
curvilinear zones (Figure 7-3c); these rims have not been identified to type.
Among the body sherds, the most common engraved decorative elements were curvilinear
engraved lines, likely from bottles, and sherds with parallel engraved lines (Table 7-2). One
Glassell Engraved (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 27) bottle sherd with curvilinear engraved lines
with tick marks was in the Site 41CS386 assemblage (Figure 7-3f), and a probable Glassell
Engraved body sherd had parallel engraved lines, one of which had diagonal tick marks. Another
bottle sherd had sets of diagonal hatched engraved lines offset from a single horizontal engraved
line (Figure 7-3a), and a grog-tempered bottle sherd had curvilinear engraved lines and a
curvilinear cross-hatched engraved zone (Figure 7-3h).
Two carinated bowl sherds had bracket-shaped engraved elements, one of which also had sets of
vertical engraved lines (Figure 7-3g). One Barkman Engraved body sherd had horizontal
engraved lines with sets of closely-spaced vertical hatched lines between two of the horizontal
lines (Figure 7-3b). A distinctive body sherd had diagonal opposed engraved triangular zones
(Figure 7-3e).

Site 41CS386 Ceramic Analysis

Figure 7-3: Engraved Rim and Body Sherds from Site 41CS386
Two fine ware sherds with engraved-excised punctated elements were from Barkman Engraved
vessels, bowls or carinated. They had horizontal engraved lines with a zone of excised punctations
between the engraved lines (Figure 7-4). One of the fine ware sherds in the assemblage simply
had rows of excised linear punctations.
The range of decorated rim and body sherds at Site 41CS386 suggest that there were two ancestral
Caddo components at the site. The first, possibly dating between ca. AD 1100-1300, had a Red
River pipe, var. Graves Chapel, as well as Davis Incised and Dunkin Incised vessel sherds. The
second component, and likely the most extensive ancestral Caddo occupation at the site, dated
from ca. AD 1400-1550, and was affiliated with the Texarkana phase. Sherds from Pease BrushedIncised, McKinney Plain, and Nash Neck Banded utility ware vessels were part of this component,
along with Barkman Engraved and Glassell Engraved sherds. One of the vessels associated with
Burial 1 was a Barkman Engraved bowl. Ceramic vessel sherd assemblages at the Snipes (41CS8)
and Knight’s Bluff (41CS14) sites are broadly similar, and perhaps contemporaneous, as they had
moderate amounts of brushed, brushed-appliqued, brushed-incised, and brushed-punctated utility
wares (primarily from Pease Brushed-Incised vessels), as well as McKinney Plain and Nash Neck
Banded jar sherds, a late variant of Dunkin Incised, and Barkman Engraved fine ware sherds
(Sitters and Perttula 2017:69-70; Jelks 1961; Perttula et al. 1998).

Ceramic Plug

The ceramic plug found in the Feature 1 shell midden at Site 41CS386 was 30.5 x 24.5 millimeters
in length and width and was 7.6 millimeters in thickness (Figure 7-5). Its intended use may have
been to plug or stopper a ceramic vessel orifice (possibly a bottle based on its size). A 6.9
millimeter diameter hole was drilled through the ceramic plug itself at some point during its use.

Ceramic Pipe Sherds

A single Red River style, long-stemmed, ceramic pipe proximal stem sherd was recovered from
the surface of Feature 1 (Figure 7-6). The pipe was bone-tempered, and had an exterior stem
diameter of 11.0 millimeters; the stem hole diameter itself was 4.2 millimeters. The exterior stem
diameter of the pipe is consistent with the Graves Chapel variety of Red River pipe, likely dating
to the latter part of the Early Caddo Period and the first part of the Middle Caddo Period (ca. AD
1100-1300) (Hoffman 1967:9-10).

Burned Clay

Two pieces of burned clay found at the site were from shovel tests BN 514 (40-60 cmbs) and TH
384 (20-40 cmbs). These were amorphous-shaped pieces of clay exposed to fire; neither of the
pieces had any stick or grass impressions, as would be found on pieces of daub. The burned clay
at the site is evidence for some use of hearths and earth ovens for cooking and heating activities;
localized heating would have fired sediments, producing pieces of burned clay. The limited
amounts of burned clay found at this site suggest that the recovered pieces represent incidental
exposures of pit and oven walls, and dirt floors, to heating or fires.

Chapter 8 – Recommendations
In general, the location of all prehistoric and historic sites across this part of the East Texas
landscape can provide relevant, but basic, information on the patterns of settlement and settlement
choices that existed through time (at least in a gross sense, i.e., historic versus prehistoric, and how
they may have varied in certain prehistoric periods), particularly as they may relate to different
adaptive strategies employed by prehistoric and historic groups living in and/or using these
physiographic zones in the Sulphur and Angelina River basins. The research significance of these
archeological sites increases at the archeological survey level (and beyond) if they also contain
diagnostic artifacts, which prehistoric sites in the project area possess. However, archeological
sites will have the greatest potential in a qualitative sense to address important research questions
in East Texas archeology if they have integrity.
In archeological terms, integrity of sites documented in an archeological survey is best assessed
by ascertaining if any of the sites have the following characteristics:
a) The archeological deposits appear intact—not visibly disturbed, mixed, or bioturbated—
and features have either been identified, or the potential exists for features to be present;
b) There exists, or the potential exists, for intra-site patterning in artifacts/archeological
deposits and/or features (including any surviving buried features); and
c) Representative samples of artifacts and/or features will be present and can be obtained from
undisturbed contexts from assemblages preserved in the archeological deposits.
Typically, in archeological survey investigations that rely on the findings from shovel testing to
ascertain integrity, as well as research potential, it is the distribution, context, character, and
density of artifacts from shovel testing—rather than features—that carries the most weight in
assessments of research significance since the probability of encountering features or potential
features in shovel testing work is very low. Should prehistoric or historic archeological sites
documented in the survey appear to have integrity of content and setting— along with relevant
spatial and/or temporal data on settlement location and use of the landform from shovel testing
information, and the possibility exists that the age of the occupation can be determined through
absolute means (i.e., radiocarbon, thermoluminescence, optically-stimulated luminescence [OSL]
dating, etc.) from the recovery of charred plant remains, ceramic sherds, and sediment samples—
then they will more than likely be able to contribute important information on the prehistory and
history of this part of Texas.
Such sites would have the potential to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under several criteria
(36 CFR 60.4), although a definitive demonstration of research potential is almost impossible to
achieve with archeological sites known only from survey-level investigations. If prehistoric or
historic archeological sites could be documented during the present archeological survey project
that clearly had preserved midden deposits found in the shovel testing, demonstrated that they had
discrete archeological deposits with a range of material of known age, any preserved plant and/or
animal remains, and a high likelihood for features to be preserved given their depositional context,

April 2019

Page 219

Recommendations

then such sites would have the potential to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion
D (36 CFR Part 60.4d).
Prehistoric or historic archeological sites with poor contextual integrity, as well as extensive
disturbances (from such things as past timber harvesting, erosion, pipeline construction, road
construction, heavy machinery activity, etc.), would be considered ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP. This is because they (1) would not have the potential to contribute to a better understanding
of the prehistory or history of East Texas, and (2) would not add new and important information
that would address current research questions and regional research problems.
Based on this discussion regarding integrity and the archeological content/context of individual
sites from the perspective of an archeological survey with shovel testing, as well as the site
descriptions presented earlier—and keeping in mind the limited amount of archeological
investigations (i.e., shovel tests) that the prehistoric and historic sites have received during this
pedestrian survey and shovel testing effort—it is our opinion that only Site 41CS386 warrants
inclusion in the NRHP at this time. This site should be avoided, preserved, and protected.
An additional eight archeological sites appear to have research potential, and warrant protection
and avoidance by the USACE until test excavations can be conducted to determine if they meet
the criteria specified in 36 CFR Part 60.4 of the NRHP (Table 8-1). We recommend these sites
as being of undetermined eligibility for the NRHP. These sites appear to have intact and preserved
archeological deposits with intra-site information on cultural activities and intra-site occupational
areas during prehistoric times. Provided that (a) temporally isolable components can be identified
during additional archeological work at the sites—beyond the information already obtained during
the archeological survey—and (b) representative samples of archeological materials and features
can be obtained from the sites during any future investigation of their archeological character, then
(c) important research insights gained into the settlement and long-term use of different parts of
the Sulphur and Angelina River basins by different aboriginal groups would demonstrate the
research potential of these eight sites.

Another 12 archeological sites (Table 8-2) identified in this cultural resource survey of 1,874 acres
at Sam Rayburn Reservoir and Wright Patman Lake are also of undetermined NRHP eligibility,
but less information is available about their archeological character compared to the sites listed in
Table 8-1, although the shovel testing investigations suggest they also contain intact and relatively
undisturbed archeological deposits. These sites also warrant test excavations to determine their

The occurrence of ceramics—albeit not necessarily in large quantities at any one of this group of
sites—does point to the development of some occupational redundancy (i.e., a tethering to certain
locations and a repeated and consistent use of those locations) in site use in Woodland and Late
Prehistoric period times in the project area. In a study of the use of ceramics among Native
American groups, Eerkens (2003:736) suggested that “the degree of occupational redundancy in
areas with resources suited to mass collecting and boiling [are]… correlated with pottery use.”
This occupational redundancy may promote long-term trends in decreasing mobility and
increasing sedentism, and in such settings, the use of pottery may be also “associated with incipient

agricultural strategies” (Eerkens 2003:736). In the case of the Woodland and Late Prehistoric sites
in this part of the Sulphur and Angelina River basins, the presence of pottery development suggests
these sites were occupied for lengthier periods of time than was the case in Archaic Period times.
Consequently, we can expect that residential features and concentrated artifact clusters may be
present.
The remaining sites are considered not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Table 8-3). These 39
sites have poor contextual integrity and past disturbances. They also lack substantive research
potential because of their limited archeological content. It is our opinion that these prehistoric
and/or historic sites do not have the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the
prehistory or history of this part of East Texas or add new and important information that would
address pertinent research questions or research problems focusing on the unique character of
Piney Woods Texas archeology.

Because these sites do not have any potential to contribute to a better understanding of the

Chapter 9 – Conclusion
8.1

Summary of Work

This cultural resource survey investigated four parcels across three counties at Sam Rayburn
Reservoir and Wright Patman Lake in East Texas. The APE totaled 1,874 acres, with parcels
ranging in size from 104 to 1,408 acres. Field methods included a pedestrian inventory
accompanied by the excavation of 2,238 shovel tests. Of the shovel tests, 685 had cultural
materials, for a net ubiquity of 41.7 percent. Overall, the net rate of shovel testing was 1.19 tests
per acre. Tests were roughly 30 centimeters in diameter and were dug to 100 cmbs or until
encountering a restrictive feature, such as basal clay or the water table.

8.1.1

Archeological Resources

As a result of the field efforts, 60 archeological sites and 12 Isolated Finds (Table 9-1) were
documented in the survey areas. The sites included 44 newly-discovered sites and 16 previouslyrecorded sites (41CS103, 41CS104, 41CS105, 41CS106, 41CS107, 41CS108, 41CS109,
41CS110, 41CS111, 41CS116, 41CS117, 41CS118, 41NA131, 41SA96, 41SA128, 41SA137).
The Atlas (2018) depicts Site 41CS103 within the Wright Patman Flatwoods parcel; however,
shovel testing and a surface inspection at its location produced no cultural materials. Coupled with
a clay surface texture, we believe the site was destroyed through numerous fluctuations in the
lake’s water level. No standing structures or other non-archeological resources were observed in
any of the survey parcels. Of the 61 sites, 59 have prehistoric components, 3 sites have both
prehistoric and historic occupations, and 1 site is solely historic in age.

Conclusion

Of the 60 sites, one (41CS386) is considered eligible for listing to the NRHP. An additional 20
sites are of undetermined eligibility (Tables 8-1 and 8-2). These archeological sites have research
potential, and warrant protection and avoidance by the USACE until test excavations can be
conducted to determine if they meet the criteria specified in 36 CFR Part 60.4 of the NRHP. The
remaining 39 archeological sites (Table 8-3) have little to no potential to contribute to a better
understanding of the prehistory or history of East Texas. Thus, they do not warrant further work.
We recommend that future development projects by, or authorized by, the USACE be allowed to
proceed without further consideration in the immediate area of these sites.

8.1.2

Analysis of Survey Tactics

As is discussed above in Section 4.2, the current inventory employed a survey tactic modified
from previous efforts at the two lakes. This tactic emphasized shovel testing in those areas that
had been defined a priori as high probability based on topography supplemented with archival
information on historic farmsteads and previous site locations. This strategy recorded a markedly
higher frequency of recorded sites than previous inventories that had employed a non-stratified
and systematic shovel testing strategy. A comparison of these results is available in Bentley et al.
2017.

Discussion of Site
41CS103 is a previously recorded site located within the Flatwoods parcel described by Alton Briggs as a ôsmall,
chipping station eroding into a cove at Wright Patman Lakeö (Atlas 2018). No site boundary is depicted on the
Atlas, but the site is described as measuring 10 by 10 meters in size and the centroid is plotted south of previouslyrecorded Site 41CS104. At the time of the siteÆs initial recording, only lithic debitage was observed on the
surface. Based on these findings, no additional work was recommended for Site 41CS103.
During the site revisit, investigators found the area to be marshy and heavily eroded with exposed roots and a clay
surface texture. A low mound was identified about 40 m north of the plotted centroid and was tested (BN-454) on
the supposition that the centroid may have been slightly mis-plotted on the Atlas. This test yielded a soil profile
characterized by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay to a depth of 10 cmbs but contained no cultural material. The lack
of cultural-bearing deposits led investigators to conclude that the site is either completely eroded away or was misplotted on the Atlas (2018). It is likely that Site 41CS103 was the southern extension of Site 41CS104 and has
since been destroyed from fluctuations in the lakeÆs water level.

Discussion of Site
"The site is a multi-component, prehistoric site spanning from the Woodland period into the Late Prehistoric. The
site is situated along a narrow ridge that slopes from northeast to southwest towards the lake. The landform is
bordered on both sides by drainages. With an elevation of 230 to 240 feet AMSL, the landform is overlain by
Bernaldo fine sandy loam (0 to 3 percent slopes), Socagee silty clay loam (0 to 1 percent slopes), and Wrightsville
silt loam (0 to 1 percent slopes) (USDA-NRCS 2018). Shovel tests containing cultural material revealed a soil
profile characterized by yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (Depth: min=20 cmbs; max=85 cmbs) containing
sandstone gravels underlain by (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of 85 cmbs.
Archeologists excavated 37 shovel tests across the landform. Twenty-one contained artifacts. Cultural materials
recovered during shovel testing consisted of lithic debitage (n=25), FCR, a dart point that compares favorably to
the Gary type, an unidentified arrow point, and a single ceramic sherd. Artifacts were documented between the
surface and 80 cmbs. Lithic raw material among the artifacts consisted of jasper, novaculite, and quartzite."

Discussion of Site
During survey a total of 15 shovel tests were placed throughout the site area, of which nine led to the recovery of
cultural materials. Artifacts recovered consist of historic (n=24) and pre-contact (n=12) material and as well as
small unidentifiable fragments of bone (n=2). Pre-contact period artifacts were recovered across the site and
consist of a ceramic sherd (n=1) and lithic debitage (n=11). The lithic debris consists of interior flakes composed
of novaculite, yellowish-brown chert, gray chert, red jasper and quartzite. Pre-contact period artifacts were
recovered from depths that range from zero to 60 cmbs, with 50 percent of artifacts located in the upper 40 cmbs,
and 50 percent located between 40 and 60 cmbs. The ceramic sherd was recovered between zero and 20 cmbs.
Historic artifacts recovered at this site consist of colorless vessel glass (n=4), a glazed ceramic sherd (n=1), a
whiteware ceramic sherd (n=1), metal hardware (n=1) and fragments (n=1), metal square nails (n=4), wire nails
(n=6), and window glass (n=3). all located between zero and 40 cmbs. About 79 percent of historic artifacts were
recovered from between zero and 20 cmbs. The two fragments of bone were recovered from the same shovel test
(TH-411) that also included the window glass between zero and 20 cmbs.

Discussion of Site
"The site is a Woodland period lithic scatter with an Ancestral Caddo component that measures X acres in size.
The site was observed on a stream terrace that overlooks the Sulphur River channel to the north, which is now
Wright Patman Lake. Artifacts were also documented on the shore, below a heavily eroded cut bank. Clay was
exposed at the surface through wave action; thus, no shovel tests were excavated along the shore. A public
recreation area, labeled Pine Bluff on topographic maps, is located above and to the south of the site. Mechanical
scraping was evident across the western half of the Pine Bluff recreation area. Shovel tests excavated within this
portion of the recreation area revealed yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam (Depth: min=5 cmbs; max=31
cmbs) underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Shovel tests in the recreation area reached a maximum depth of
35 cmbs. Shovel tests excavated within the eastern half of the site were characterized by red (2.5YR 4/8) mottled
with strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay. Here shovel tests terminated at a maximum depth of 10 cmbs. Elevation along
the shoreline was estimated to be 226 feet AMSL, while along the stream terrace elevation reaches 232 feet AMSL.
A visual inspection of the shore produced lithic debitage (n=39), flake cores (n=2), FCR, a biface, ground stone, an
untyped dart point, a projectile point that compares favorably to the Gary type, and ceramic sherds (n=6). Roughly
14 shovel tests were excavated along the stream terrace, of which four tested positive for cultural materials (BN593, DS-212, DS-213, and DS-215). Artifacts collected from the subsurface include lithic debitage (n=3) and a
projectile point that compares favorably to the Gary type. Cultural materials were observed to a maximum depth of
10 cmbs. Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the site included jasper, novaculite, and
quartzite."

Discussion of Site
"The is a Woodland period site that measures approximately X acres in size and is situated to the southeast of and
downslope from site XXX. Located on a narrow ridge that slopes from north to south towards the lake, the site is
bordered by a low-lying area to the west and a drainage to the east. Elevation across the site ranges from 232 to
247 feet AMSL. Soils within the site area are associated with Eastwood very fine sandy loam (5 to 15 percent
slopes, USDA-NRCs 2018). Positive shovel tests were characterized by very dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy
loam (Depth: min=30 cmbs; max=80 cmbs) with gravels underlain by strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam. Shovel
tests reached a maximum depth of 80 cmbs.
During the delineation of site XXX, fifteen shovel tests were excavated within the site area, all of which tested
positive for cultural materials (BN-481, BN-482, BN-483, BN-484, DS-149, DS-150, DS-151, DS-152, DS-153,
SM-357, SM-358, SM-359, TH-355, TH-356, and TH-357). In addition, artifacts were observed on the surface of
the southernmost shore. The site’s artifact assemblage consisted of lithic debitage (n=94), pitted stone, and dart
points (n=2) that compare favorably to the Gary type. Raw materials used in the manufacturing of lithic tools at the
site included jasper, novaculite, and quartzite. Artifacts were recovered from the surface to a maximum depth of 80
cmbs."

feet amsl, the site area is occupied by mature pine, young hickory, post oak and elm trees with yaupon dispersed
throughout the understory. Ground surface ranged from zero to five percent due to the presence of leaf litter and
pine duff. The landform on which this site is located abuts the current level of the Sam Rayburn Reservoir. Due to
an increased level of the reservoir, the shoreline at this site was submerged. The landform on which the site is
located is bound by two low-lying drainages on the north and south sides.

Discussion of Site
This is a Late Prehistoric occupation site where a total of 16 chipped stone artifacts were recovered. During site
investigation shovel tests were excavated within the site area. Eleven of these contained cultural materials which
consisted entirely of chipped stone artifacts. These artifacts consist of lithic interior and cortical flakes (n=14) one
edge modified flake tool (n=1) and a plano-convex small (10 x 7 mm) arrow point (n=1). Raw materials used in
the production of these artifacts include petrified wood, yellow brown and red jasper. All artifacts were recorded at
depths that ranged from zero to 54 cmbs, with 62 percent of artifacts located between zero and 20 cmbs.
The inclusion of the arrow point gives this site a temporal affiliation with the Late Prehistoric period. Additionally,
the inclusion of the arrow point and modified flake tool along with the lithic debitage imply varied activity at this
site which could have led to the deposition of additional types of artifacts.

Discussion of Site
During recent investigations, 35 shovel tests were excavated across the finger ridge and 28 contained cultural
materials. The artifact assemblage includes lithic debitage (n=103), a dart point that compares favorably to the
Carrollton type , and ceramic sherds (n=31). The lithic debitage is composed of chert, jasper, petrified wood, and
quartzite. Artifacts were recovered from depths ranging from zero to 100 cmbs with 81 percent of ceramic sherds
and 63 percent of lithic debitage located between zero and 40 cmbs.
Only 6.4 percent of the ceramic sherds are from Woodland period Mossy Grove culture vessels. These are from
sandy paste Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified vessels. The remaining 93.6 percent of the sherds from 41SA96
are from ancestral Caddo vessels tempered with various mixtures of grog, bone, and hematite. The most common
temper groups in the assemblage are bone-tempered (31 percent of the ancestral Caddo sherds) and grog-tempered
(28 percent); 50 percent of the decorated sherds are from bone-tempered vessels. More than 65 percent of the
ancestral Caddo ceramic sherds have grog as a temper; 55 percent of the sherds have bone temper; and 24 percent
have crushed hematite temper.
More than 87 percent of the decorated sherds from 41SA96 are from utility wares, and 43 percent of the utility
wares are from Bullard Brushed jars (see Suhm and Jelks 1962) with brushed or brushed-incised marks and lines.
The considerable proportion of sherds from brushed jars in the assemblage suggest that the ancestral Caddo
occupation took place after ca. A.D. 1200, when brushed vessels began to be produced and used by Caddo peoples
in East Texas. It is most likely that the occupation at 41SA96 was after ca. A.D. 1400, during the late Caddo
period Angelina phase, when bone-tempered brushed vessels were common on ancestral Caddo sites in the Neches
and Angelina river basins in East Texas (see Perttula 2013).
The one fine ware body sherd from 41SA96 is from a bone-tempered vessel of unknown ceramic type. It has at
least one horizontal engraved line and a vertical engraved bracket element.

Discussion of Site
During recent investigations, a total of 25 shovel tests were excavated across the finger ridge. Of these,19 tested
positive for cultural materials. Artifacts included lithic debitage (n=191), a tested cobble, FCR, a piece of
unidentified fauna, and ceramic sherds (n=17). Lithic raw materials present in the assemblage include jasper,
petrified wood, sandstone, and quartzite. Artifacts range in depth from zero to 100 cmbs with about 84 percent of
the assemblage recorded between zero and 60 cmbs.
Woodland (n=4) and ancestral Caddo (n=13) ceramic vessel sherds were recovered at site 41SA137. The
Woodland period sherds are from Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified vessels. The ancestral Caddo vessel sherds
include nine plain rim and body sherds, and four sherds from grog-tempered brushed and brushed-incised vessels,
likely from a post-A.D. 1400 Late Caddo period Angelina phase occupation. The vessels are from vessels
tempered with grog (n=4), grog-bone (n=7), bone (n=1), and bone-hematite (n=1). The high frequency of both
brushed and bone-tempered vessels at 41SA137 indicates the ceramic assemblage is part of the Late Caddo
brushed-bone-tempered ceramic horizon in the Neches and Angelina river basins in east Texas.

Discussion of Site
During survey, a total of six shovel tests were excavated in delineation of the site, four of which tested positive for
cultural materials. Five shovel tests were placed across the exposed portion of the finger-slope, and one negative
test was excavated on a small circular landform north of the finger-slope. A thin, shallow drainage separated this
circular landform from the fingerslope on which the site is located. Artifacts recovered consist of ten (n=10) pieces
of lithic debitage. The assemblage consists of thin interior flakes and angular non-cortical debris. Lithic raw
materials observed in the artifacts consist of novaculite, yellow-brown chert, red jasper and petrified wood. All
artifacts were recovered between zero and 60 cmbs.

Discussion of Site
A total of eight shovel tests were placed across the finger-slope, six of which recovered cultural materials. These
artifacts consist of lithic debitage (n=28) and a partially fractured Friley arrow point. The lithic debitage consist
thin lithic flakes and one fragment of angular debris, all of which contain either partial or no cortex. Raw materials
present in the debitage include yellow brown chert, red jasper and petrified wood. The Friley arrow was recovered
from shovel test SM-483 between 40 and 60 cmbs and is composed of red jasper. The presence of the arrow point
gives this site a temporal association with the Late Prehistoric period. All artifacts were recovered from depths that
range from zero to 80 cmbs.

Located across a terraced interfluve along Ayish Bayou at around 190 feet amsl. The landform on which this site is
located is currently surrounded by the waters of the Sam Rayburn Reservoir on three sides. The project area wraps
around the periphery of this peninsula and based on the results of shovel testing we are confident that future
investigations would find that this site occupies the interior of the peninsula as well. Cypress trees are located
along the lake shore in the site area with large pine trees and some scattered undergrowth throughout the site.

Discussion of Site
Shovel tests were excavated within the site are of which 18 contained cultural materials. A total of 150 artifacts
and one midden feature were recorded in shovel tests at this site. Artifacts consist of bone (n=1), lithic debris
(n=136) and ceramic sherds (n=13). The lithic assemblage consists one core (n=1), a sandstone fire cracked rock
(n=1) and debitage (n=134) that includes angular debris, cortical and interior flakes that range from five cm to less
than one cm. in size. Lithic raw materials present in this assemblage include petrified wood, red jasper, pink,
yellow brown and brown cherts, and novaculite. All artifacts were recovered between zero and 60 cmbs. The
majority (78%) of artifacts were recorded in the upper 20 cm of soil.
