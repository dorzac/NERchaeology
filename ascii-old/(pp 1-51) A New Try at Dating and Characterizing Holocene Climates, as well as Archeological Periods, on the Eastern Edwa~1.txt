A New Try at Dating and Characterizing
Holocene Climates, as Well as
Archeological Periods, on the
Eastern Edwards Plateau1

LeRoy Johnson
with the collaboration of
Glenn T. Goode

ABSTRACT
This paper helps redefine the Holocene climate of the eastern Edwards
Plateau and dates its changes with radiocarbon assays only of charcoal. Age
determinations are largely from the Jonas Terrace site (41ME29) of Medina
County and stream deposits from the Fort Hood Military Reservation. No
Hypsithermal climate obviously affected the Edwards Plateau, although a dry,
Late Holocene Edwards Interval peaked forcefully around 1900 B.C. (all dates
calibrated). Three principal Archaic archeological periods are redefined as to
cultura! content, and also in terms of major climatic events. The Early and
Middle Archaic periods are set backward in time, the former beginning about
6500 B.C. and the latter around 3600 B.C. The Late Archaic period, which
commences with the onset of the Edwards climatic interval, began at 2300
B.C. and was arid in its earliest days. It may have seen a spread of xerophytic
plants in the Plateau’s uplands and did witness the creation of many burnedrock middens largely from baking those and other plants in stone-lined pits
and basins. The creation of rock middens is surely unconnected with the
cooking or leaching of acorns, in spite of claims. Foreign influences are mentioned, in different periods, that come ultimately from the Plains and Eastern
Woodlands.

Much of this study was sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation
(Environmental Affairs Division, Dianna Noble, Director) as part of the analysis of
archeologicai site 41ME29 by LeRoy Johnson of the Texas Historical Commission. The
TxDOT has kindly permitted publication of the present document, as part of their general
program of inquiry into Texas history and prehistory.

CLIMATES AND ARCHEOLOGICAL REMAINS

In most syntheses of regions, it is customary to see natural and
archeological materials treated as quite separate topics. Those expositions are
seldom meshed and melded to present a single picture based on local flora,
paleoclimates, and so forth. Here, at least I try to do just that, and sketch out a
unitary history of the eastern Edwards Plateau to which assorted disciplines offer
information in one way or another. Findings made at the Jonas Terrace site
(41ME29) contribute to that general history, and even make timely its rewriting
and restructuring.
This paper does two tolerably specific things: it refines the definition of
Holocene climates for the Edwards Plateau east of 99° 30’ West longitude and
sanitizes their dating, and also refines and re-periodizes the regional Archaic
and Post-Archaic cultures. The idea behind choosing the indicated meridian is
to separate (somewhat arbitrarily) the western and drier part of the Plateau from
the moister eastern section (Figure 1), so that the latter can be considered separately. On the Edwards Plateau, Holocene climates of different periods furnished
occasionally dissimilar environmental stages upon which aboriginal populations
performed their social and economic dramas. Because aboriginal culture is
molded to climate at least in part, the two are worth summarizing together.
Although all the information which follows applies to the Plateau in one way or
another, some of it is from the adjacent Blackland Prairie or Coastal Plain south
of the Plateau’s escarpment, while other useful data come from more distant
places. The possible seasonal movement of some aboriginal groups between the
Plateau and its attached lowlands makes the latter important.
Central Texas, particularly the eastern Edwards Plateau, is a transitional
region of subtropical, subhumid climate that can easily swing to dry extremes.
Average annual precipitation on the eastern half of the Plateau, for 1951-1980,
ranged from 32 inches in the east to 26 inches in the west; and average annual
temperatures varied from 67° F in the south of the eastern Plateau to 65° F in
the north (Larkin and Bomar 1983:2, 18, 50). Also, the region is a biological
transition zone, not a biotic province, and is made up of juniper and live oak
savannas lying west of the Eastern Woodlands (though sundered from them by
the narrow Blackland Prairie) and east of grasslands or desert scrublands.
Furthermore, the Plateau lies just south and southeast of the American Great
Plains. It is striking and significant that two-thirds of the terrestrial vertebrates of
central Texas are at the edge of their range (Gehlbach 1991). Given the
transitional nature of the eastern Edwards Plateau, one would predict certain
vegetational and faunal changes in the region throughout the Holocene, as climate
varied somewhat from one subperiod to another. Nonetheless, the Post-Glacial
climatic norm, once established, has been (and is) mesic and subhumid, with
only occasional major lapses into drier conditions. Past shifts in the Plateau’s
climate and natural environment, whether gradual or sudden, must not be
overstated.

On the le~hand side of Figure 2 is a graph that represents the Holocene
climate for the central part of Texas, which has the Plateau at its center, from
7000 B.C2 onwards. The chart mainly shows a very slow and slight increase in
temperature and associated dryness, although the Holocene is punctuated by a
few major long-term weather changes.3 On the chart, the nature of temperature
and moisture changes is fixed more securely than previously, because of what
has been learned in the last decade or so from so-termed geomorphological studies (e.g., Cowhouse Creek at Fort Hood [Nordt 1992, 1993]), as well as from a
consideration of vertebrate fossils (e.g., from Hall’s Cave [Toomey 1993]) and
fossil pollen (e.g., from Patschke Bog [Camper 1991]).
Compared to what was accomplished before, it is now possible to make
considerable improvements in dating climatic events. This has largely been done
by selecting for use nearly 50 wood-charcoal radiocarbon assays mostly from
joint archeological and "geomorphic" contexts, and by calibrating those dates
using tree-ring corrections (Tables 1 and 2). The principal assays are for material
collected from the terrace of San Geronimo Creek (at site 41ME29),4 northwest
of San Antonio, and from the streams of Fort Hood;5 depositional and erosional
events in the two areas can be correlated.
Regrettably, no other suitably precise and long series of geomorphic charcoal dates exists for the area of study. A quite long sequence has been reported
by Blum (1992) for the Colorado River, but its radiocarbon ages fail to date
contacts between sedimentary members at all well. I have mainly, but not exclusively, consulted age results from charcoal found in place in aboriginal hearths or
middens, on or within terraces; solitary fragments of wood charcoal occurring
loose in sediments are less reliable for dating stratigraphic members, since their
origin can be ambiguous. This is not to say that humate dates should be employed in their stead when one has a choice between radiocarbon assays for the
two materials.
2 All dates used here are true calendric ages, so far as they can be estimated from
radiocarbon assays or calculated by counting ice varves--including dates that originally
appeared in other publications. Ages produced by the radiocarbon dating technique have
been calibrated via Stuiver and Reimer (1993).
3This progressive change toward aridity is not reflected in the new temperature chart
for the Summit ice core of Greenland (Dansgaard et al. 1993:Figure 1) or in the Vostok ice
column from eastern Antarctica (Dansgaard et al. 1993:note 5); both indicate an opposite
but minor cooling trend over the last ten millennia that should generalize to large parts of
the planet.
4 Twelve charcoal assays, with tree-ring calibrations, come from the present Jonas
Terrace site, and helped date the present climatic and archeological chart (Table 1).
5 Nordt (1992:Appendix J) describes, among others, 34 radiocarbon ages corrected
for 8~3C that are used to date the present chart; he provides their provenience and
sedimentary context. The results.of Nordt’s assays have here been calibrated with treering data in Table 2.

As things have turned out, attempts by geographers studying landforms to
use bulk humate assays of soil carbon in order to date periods of soil formation
(and, by inference, resident but earlier depositional members and associated
climates) are often wrong or ambiguous; the dates are too old. Generally speaking, soil dates should be more recent than the depositional age of the sediments
in which they form, except in the case of slowly building deposits where soils

develop during aggradation. Further, it is understood that humate dates for bulk
soil samples in fact produce mean-residence ages, since both recent and more
ancient in situ humates are mixed in soils. Archeologists sometimes try to correct mean-residence dates by correlating a number of them with the results of
wood-charcoal assays, although the results are usually imprecise and hard to
justify using.

The point to be made here, however, is that intrusive dead carbon can
become incorporated in developing soils, and this carbon does not derive from
locally decomposing organic matter which contributes to the true average residence age of humates. When ancient, dead carbon from upland areas or elsewhere is added to humates that developed in place, it causes the results of soil
radiocarbon assays to be too old (Nordt 1992:9). Recent studies for Fort Hood
(Nordt 1992) and Buda (Abbott 1993) compare humate and charcoal assays from
similar contexts, proving that humate assays, especially on or near the Edwards

Johnson & Goode m Edwards Plateau Holoeene Climates & Archeological Periods

Plateau, produce ages that can be centuries or millennia too ancient for the soils
they are supposed to date. It is also true that sediment dates from colloidal carbon
attached mainly to clays can run older than the true age of deposition. Charcoal
of known origin is the key to the successful dating of sediments, at least when
one can reasonably infer that it is contemporaneous with the enclosing deposits.
A few words are in order concerning the correlation of strata or
unconformities at the Jonas Terrace site, 41ME29, with similar stratigraphic
members defined for the Fort Hood Military Reservation (Figure 3). This correlation is the underpinning of events depicted and dated in Figure 2. Alluvial
Stratum 6 of 41ME29 correlates with Fort Hood’s alluvial Member C quite
nicely, and the beginnings of each may date to around 6000 or 5900 B.C. Both of
these deep strata were truncated by erosion, according to the radiocarbon assays,
between about 2700 and 2500 B.C., marking a very dry period when floodplain
aggradation stopped everywhere for a shorter or longer period.
During this period of surface stability, man-made detritus and colluvium
accumulated slowly to create Strata 5 and 4 at the Jonas Terrace site, during an
interval of almost 1,700 years. At Ford Hood, certain streams likewise failed to
build fluvial overbank deposits during the same period, whereas other streams
recommenced floodplain aggradation quickly, maybe around 2600 or 2500 B.C.
This created alluvial (or outwash-fan) Member D1 at Fort Hood, which correlates in time with Strata 5 and 4 of the Jonas Terrace site on San Geronimo
Creek. The growth of Stratum 4 and Member D1 ceased about 600 or 500 B.C.,
according to the charcoal dates, and shortly thereafter floodplain/terrace aggradation commenced once more, creating alluvial Stratum 3 at Jonas Terrace and
alluvial Member D2 at Fort Hood.
A correlation between Jonas Terrace Strata 2-3 (probably including Stratum
1 [not shown]) and alluvial Member D2 at Fort Hood is indicated, while the
widespread aggradation responsible for D2 continued presumably until about
A.D. 1200 or 1250. I deem the latest radiocarbon assay for D2 (Table 2, no. 24),
which is a bit more modern than A.D. 1300, to be too recent since deposition of
overlying alluvial Member E had apparently commenced by that date. Before
that time, in any case, a long period of alluviation had created Member D2 at Fort
Hood, as well as Stratum 3 (mainly lacking human debris) and then Stratum 2
(with hearths and aboriginal artifacts) at Jonas Terrace. The sedimentary record
above Stratum 2 is unclear at Jonas Terrace, because overlying deposits were
damaged by agriculture and road construction. Dating to A.D. 1200 or 1250, an
unconformity at Fort Hood suggests a short period of considerable aridity.

DEFINING ARCHEOLOGICAL PERIODS
On the right-hand side of Figure 2 there appears a tentative revision of the
Archaic Era into periods named Early, Middle, and Late; the Paleoindian and
Post-Archaic eras are also shown. My desire is to redefine the three Archaic

periods in terms of what they reflect about gross patterns of human behavior and
their changes. Everyone will surely agree that periods should correspond to the
major perceived events of the past, and that periods will serve little purpose if
they carve up history in an arbitrary way.
To be useful, periods should segregate time spans whose archeological
content is fairly uniform. Furthermore, they ought ideally to commence with
some combination of the following: the appearance in a region of new artifact

complexes, new dart-point styles, or new people; a change in economic and other
behavior; a shift in the size of a region’s human population; or a major climatic
and vegetational change capable of affecting human life. And for major periods
of the type defined below, the perceived events need to represent trends of some
duration, although a period’s content can vary a bit through the years.
In 1962, Dee Ann Suhm counseled a division of the Archaic Era of Canyon
Lake into periods (Johnson et al. 1962), with the idea in mind of imitating
temporal units defined for the Eastern Woodlands. At that time, it seemed that a
few developmental parallels could be seen with the Archaic cultures of the
eastern United States, where a three-part division was first proposed and used. In
the Canyon Lake study, however, a fourth or Transitional period was added to
the three primary Archaic divisions, since some scholars seemingly think four to
be a magical number, although the extra period was never used by all scholars
working in central Texas.
Then, in 1964, Lee Johnson published a three-part division of the Archaic
Era for the Lower Pecos/Devil’s River region, and the composition and dating of
the previous periods for Canyon Lake had to be modified to bring them in line
with new information about the age of Archaic materials. It was also necessary to
allow for inclusion in the Archaic Era of stone tools from the Devit’s Mouth site
(41VV188) that preceded the misidentified and hence mislabeled "Early Archaic" (here, upper Middle Archaic) of the eastern Edwards Plateau. The curious
reader may wonder why the 1962 attempt to define Archaic periods at Canyon
Lake was inadequate for certain stretches of time. I can only say that it is a
wonder that the results were as useful’ as they turned out to be, since before
excavations were done at Canyon Lake not much was known about the relative
ages of major dart-point styles on the Plateau, much less about their true ages.
Furthermore, the writers of the Canyon Lake study were burdened by false
notions about the evolution of dart point styles, and mistakenly thought that
Nolan and Travis dart points, which they placed in an Early Archaic period,
derived directly from Paleoindian ancestors such as Angostura points.
Before long, the 1964 revision was applied by various archeologists to
eastern parts of the Edwards Plateau, since it is relatively easy to correlate the
archeology of that region with the prehistory of the Lower Pecos. The first
general and quite successful application was made by Sorrow et al. (1967) for
Stillhouse Hollow Lake on the Lampasas River. Although several period changes
and additions have been suggested (though not accepted universally) for the
Archaic Era since 1964, the three major Archaic periods and their artifact content
have been left.largely unaltered until now. Of course, a number of tool styles
have been assigned to the various Archaic periods since 1964. As said, Johnson
et al. (1962:Figure 45) originally proposed a Transitional Archaic period at the
end of the Archaic Era. This time unit, corresponding to the latest part of the
present Late Archaic II subperiod (with small "dart" points), proved of little
interest, although a number of later writers have used that period label.

18

Texas Archeological Society

Additionally, Sollberger and Hester (1972:326-327) proposed adding a
transitional Pre-Archaic period following the Paleoindian Era, although the
concept did not take hold. Not long afterwards, E. Mott Davis (Prewitt and
Nance 1980:3-4; Prewitt 1981:68) suggested Neoarchaic as a period label for the
Archaic-like cultures of central Texas that existed after the bow was adopted, yet
lacked horticulture. However, Prewitt’s (n.d.) Post-Archaic appellation
encompasses the same cultural phenomena that characterize the variously termed
Neo-American, Neoindian, Neoarchaic, or Late Prehistoric period. As a simple
designation free of perhaps unwanted interpretive baggage, Post-Archaic is here
preferred over the other labels.
The reader interested in general archeological syntheses of the eastern
Edwards Plateau and adjacent areas is referred to papers by Dee Ann Story
(1985) and Stephen L. Black (1989). Among a number of other things, their
reviews treat the melancholy history of archeological research in the region and
summarize a number of profusely speculative published statements by regional
archeologists about aboriginal settlement patterning, prehistoric social organization, group mobility, and the establishment of group territories. The present work
tries to avoid that kind of speculation, which nevertheless involves fascinating
mental calisthenics.
At this point, it is appropriate to mention the publication of a number of
named, supposedly sociocultural, phases for central Texas archeology by Frank
Weir (1976) and Elton Prewitt (1981). Although the "phase" label was used for
them, the San Geronimo, Clear Fork, Round Rock, and other phases were actually defined to function as periods within the Archaic or Post-Archaic eras
(Prewitt 1981:71-74). Of course, when a named regional period is given a
specific artifact content, it cannot help but function as a quasi-cultural entity.
As true phases the published units have not proven useful (Johnson 1987),
since the items that are said to make them up have rarely been shown to be
properly associated. And as minor periods often of uncertain content and age the
named "phases" are not of outstanding utility. Johnson (1987:Tables 1 and 2)
demonstrated explicitly that, all too routinely, the dated charcoal used to set the
span of a particular phase (Prewitt 1985:Table 1) was not in proper association
with diagnostic phase artifacts. In fact, the advice that Weir’s and Prewitt’s phase
names be employed as appellations for regional periods (e.g., Collins et al.
1990:92) has been one source of the recent confusion in dating and characterizing the archeology of the Edwards Plateau.
Such confusion can be seen in Bement’s (1991) study of Bering Sinkhole
(41KR241), where phases were sometimes identified strictly on the basis of the
known or suspected age of deposits, with none of the diagnostic artifacts of the
phases being present. It may well be that a series of valid Archaic and PostArchaic phases of the sociocultural sort will someday be defined for the Edwards
Plateau, but that day lies beyond the horizon.
The present revision of a threefold division of the Archaic Era can provide
all that is needed in the way of broadly conceived periods useful for culture-

historical descriptions and reconstructions. In any case, it is unquestionably time
to reconstitute the periods of the Archaic Era for the Plateau, and overhaul their
age boundaries and content. In 1964, Lee Johnson explained that his proposed
Archaic periods were tentative constructs, and anticipated changes. And, for
some time now, the periodization of the Archaic Era has needed reworking
because events and cultural trends have been perceived that were not suspected
in the 1960s.
The historical sketch outlined below partakes of general Holocene climatic
and human-behavioral shifts in large parts of North America, such as population
growth and the development of proficient economies, which became noticeable
after mid-Holocene times. In some instances, however, the sketch recounts particular Archaic or Woodland period events in the East which have affected the
Plateau, albeit weakly. In other cases, influences from the Great Plains can be
detected on the Plateau, whereas in yet others the major events of the eastern
Edwards Plateau are purely regional developments, as far as is known. Certainly
some of the climatic episodes on the Plateau that affected aboriginal people may
be regional phenomena linked to water temperature and air currents of the Gulf
of Mexico, or even of the Pacific Ocean.
Sometimes it is possible to see that projectile point styles, which help
characterize the Archaic periods, appeared fairly suddenly on the Edwards Plateau-particularly when new styles lack eastern Plateau antecedems either in
shape or manufacturing methods. It is more difficult, however, to decide whether
new styles were carried in by immigrants or merely borrowed (usually with
modification) by Plateau folk from people living outside the region. Of course, it
is also conceivable that certain styles may have been developed locally on the
Plateau, itself, and occasionally one can choose among the three explanations.
However, if innovations in dart-head style or manufacturing were made very
quickly, whether by borrowing or by local invention, the chance is poor of
capturing the actual developmental steps in our always gross archeological record.
The existing Early Archaic and Middle Archaic periods (as well as the
versions offered here) fall much later in time than similarly named units of the
Midwest and the eastern United States. For example, the Early Archaic of North
Carolina (Phelps 1983:Figure 1.2), with Kirk dart points, began around 8000 or
7500 B.C., whereas the Early Archaic on the Edwards Plateau commences some
1500 years later. Thus a large part of the difference for the Plateau mirrors
reality, because Archaic-type cultures developed much earlier near the eastern
seaboard than in areas adjacent to the Great Plains such as the Edwards Plateau.
On the Plains and some quite nearby areas, Paleoindian cultures lasted longer
than in the East, and Archaic-type societies appeared mainly at the time
Paleoindian culture died out. Archaic tools--numerous small bifacial knives,
chipped axes and adzes, multi-purpose scrapers, abundant plant-milling implements, and barbed dart points--reflect an emphasis on a more sedentary, collecting way of life (usually with deer hunting) than do Paleoindian unifacial tools
and lance-shaped dart heads (Johnson 1989b:52).

Carving up the Archaic Era
The Early Archaic Period
The Early Archaic period of the Plateau, in some places beginning around

6500 B.C. or earlier, as at the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235), represents
almost three millennia when bison were supposedly absent from the region (cf.
Dillehay 1974). Unfortunately, the Early Holocene climate of the period is not
yet well understood and work remains to be done in characterizing it. However,
although the climate near the beginning of Holocene times was obviously warmer
and drier than previously, the pollen cores from peat bogs of east-central Texas
(especially Boriack [Bryant 1977; Bryant and Holloway 1985] and Patschke
[Camper 1991] bogs] do not reveal vegetation noticeably more xeric than tile
flora of Middle Archaic days. So whatever the climate was like in the Early
Archaic period, it is apparent that no long-lasting, dry Hypsithermal climate
affected the eastern Edwards Plateau and the lowlands to its east (cf. Bryant and
Holloway 1985:61-62), although a warm-moist Hypsithermal climate is at least
possible. Evidence for a "standard" Hypsithermal Interval would require a climatic regimen drier than what went both before and after it. Perhaps the absence
of a dry Hypsithermal is due, partly, to effects of the nearby Gulf of Mexico and
its idiosyncratic temperature patterns and wind currents, or of Pacific Ocean air
currents that cross Mexico to reach the Edwards Plateau.
However, the Hypsithermal-Atlantic climatic maximum correlates in time
with the Early Archaic period and the first part of the Middle Archaic period of
the Edwards Plateau, and in many parts of North America this warm interval was
dry. In the lower U.S. Midwest and elsewhere east of the Great Plains, the
Hypsithermal peak has been dated at around 5600-5000 B.C. (calibrated), and
the total span of the interval stretched from about 6700 B.C. to 3300 B.C.,
although it is dated variously (e.g., Brown and Vierra 1983:167). However, the
Summit ice core from Greenland shows little patterned temperature change
within the Holocene, except for a widespread, persistent cool period around 6200
B.C.--before the peak of the North American Hypsithermal. Arctic and Antarctic air and water temperatures, as well as precipitation patterns, are important
because they are often capable of mirroring planet-wide climatic trends.
Some evidence from central Texas suggests a fairly brief interval of droughts
with episodes of violent flooding at the very beginning of the Early Archaic or
just before that period. The question of interest is whether these should be
thought of as Hypsithermal events, since they appear to be a bit too early for such
a characterization.
A period of erosion and cessation of alluviation is indicated by the
unconformity separating the Pleistocene Georgetown Alluvium (Member B)
from the Early Holocene Fort Hood Member (C), in Bell and Coryell counties,
Texas (Nordt 1992). The Georgetown Member may have stopped its growth at
around 6500 B.C. or earlier (my estimate), but in any case the date is not well

Johnson & Goode -- Edwards Plateau Holocene Climates & Archeological Periods

fixed (see Figure 3). At the Jonas Terrace site, medium-sized gravel dating by
inference to around 6000 or 5900 B.C. rests upon limestone scored by flooding
perhaps some centuries earlier.6 These data betoken large-scale but brief climate
shifts during the earliest Holocene, which appear in the geologic record in a
number of other areas in and near the central part of Texas.
Lee Nordt (1992:Figure 31) assumes that terrace aggradation at Fort Hood
corresponding to the long Early Archaic period, as well as the first part of the
Middle Archaic, may represent the "Altithermal" climatic maximum. Altithermal
is a rather loosely used appellation in the American West for what is termed the
Hypsithermal Interval elsewhere in North America; the term has been applied,
however, to a number of Holocene dry periods that may be unconnected. At any
rate, Nordt suspects depletion of upland vegetation at Fort Hood, but may be
guilty of error or overstatement. A long period with some amount of overbank
flooding and floodplain growth, often producing fine-grained sediments, indicates a fairly moist climatic regimen more often than not. A dry period, typically
with periodic torrential rains but dry summers, would surely cause downcutting
and erosion. Nevertheless, it is clear that some drying occurred at least in latest
Early Archaic times.
Importantly, the bone study of Hall’s Cave (41KR474) of Kerr County
appears to support the idea of gradual drying from Late Glacial times forward
(Toomey 1993:474-475; Toomey et al. 1993), and to my eyes indicates no
recognizable Hypsithermal Interval capable of being separated out from the
remainder of the Holocene’s climatic record. However, the age of Hall’s Cave is
poorly known, since many of the site’s eleven radiocarbon assays listed by
Toomey (1993) are from unsuitable materials such as travertine and bone apatite.
For that reason I decided upon a (tentative) re-dating, using only the cave’s few
charcoal assays and the stratigraphic position of certain Early Archaic dart heads
of known age.
Whatever the case, my interpretation of Hall’s Cave is as follows (Figure 4).
The indicated maximum for the woodland least shrew of a mesic disposition, at a
depth of 1.45 m, falls already in the earliest Holocene, since Pleistocene buffalo
bones are found in the column below a depth of 1.55 m. The Holocene shift
largely winnowed out a number of moisture-loving creatures: mainly the
pipistrelle bat, eastern mole, woodland vole, and northern prairie vole. Then
there was a period of yet-increasing dryness until 3500 B.C. that falls at the end
6 The Chappice Lake sediments from southeastern Alberta are interesting because
they indicate wild fluctuations in water levels between 6100 B.C. and 5300 B.C. (Vance
and Clague 1992). At Chappice Lake, a Holocene climatic disruption, perhaps equal to
that seen at Fort Hood and Jonas Terrace before 6000 B.C., was clearly followed by a long
period of weather that was much warmer and drier than anything that came later. Nothing
like this long Hypsithermal period at Chappice Lake is indicated on the eastern Edwards
Plateau, lending support to the idea that a dry Hypsithermal climate did not affect central
(and coastal) Texas.

22

of the Early Archaic period. The indicated calendar date is reasonably appropriate
for the three terminal Early Archaic dart points, discovered between the 1.00and 1.10-m depths (see Figure 4), of the Martindale and Uvalde styles.
It is hard to know what the desert shrew maximum at a depth of 0.80 m
means, since an earlier Notiosorex spike correlates with the mesic least shrew
maximum at 1.45 m. That ambiguity is unfortunate, since the 0.80 m depth
probably falls in the climatically poorly differentiated Middle Archaic period.
Because the smooth-toothed pocket gopher was still around in those days, but
fell out of the stratigraphic column soon afterwards, I surmise that a drying trend
merely continued during the Middle Archaic; I see no evidence for a massive
Hypsithermal/Altithermal climate shift. However, at the 0.50 m depth (1500
B.C.) the indicated conditions were indeed considerably drier, for this was in the
middle of the Edwards Interval recognizable at Fort Hood, the Jonas Terrace site,
and elsewhere. (In no way is the Edwards Interval to be thought of as an
Altithermal/Hypsithermal dry period, for it is much too recent.) The smoothtoothed pocked gopher, as well as both the woodland least shrew and the dryenvironment desert shrew, were gone for the most part. It would be dimwitted to
use these data to argue for a mesic Late Archaic I subperiod.
These are the trends and dates important for archeologists. But let the
prehistorian beware, for in late 1993 Thomas Stafford of the University of
Colorado secured scores of new (but as yet unpublished) radiocarbon assays for
the Hall’s Cave stratigraphic column. Series of assays were run separately for
bone collagen, various kinds of soil humic matter, etc., and mainly produced
much earlier dates for the site’s strata (Stafford, 1993 personal communication
and public lecture) than Toomey proposed or I reckoned (in my case, using three
available charcoal assays and the known ages of Archaic projectile point styles).
I fear that dead carbon has become incorporated in some of Stafford’s dated
soils, to produce ages for Hall’s Cave Archaic strata that may be too old.
Whatever the Plateau’s climate and vegetation were like in Early Archaic
times, the people did their stone knapping in an Archaic as opposed to a
Paleoindian mode. Their dart points largely represent two broad styles, the Early
Barbed and the Early Split-Stem traditions (Prikryl 1990:51; Johnson
1991:105ff), which did not obviously develop from the region’s Paleoindian
points.7 Early Barbed dart points (many of which have been called Early CornerNotched [Hester 1971:71-73]) tend to have wide blades, as well as short and
narrow stems (produced by deep basal or corner notching) and longish down-

7 At the bottom of the Early Archaic section of Figure 2, the Hoxie point type appears
in parentheses. Elton Prewitt (1994 personal communication) believes Hoxie to be an
intrusive style related to Pryor Stemmed of the High Plains, which dates to the seventh
millennium B.C. (Frison 1978:24, 26). Hoxie is not related to either of the two main
projectile-point traditions of the Early Archaic: Early Barbed (Corner-Notched) and Early
Split Stem.

hanging barbs (e.g., Sorrow 1968:Figure 3m-r). Early Split-Stem dart points
have a clear-cut stem with bifurcated base with a central notch or concavity, and
usually exhibit very short barbs or else barbless shoulders (e.g., Johnson
1991:Figures 42-44). This almost continental style was spread far beyond the
bounds of the Edwards Plateau, as in Alabama, West Virginia, and New York
(Fiedel 1992:91-92) during the seventh and sixth millennia B.C. Related dart
points, such as the Pinto type, were also well established in the American West
(Fiedel 1992:126-129) at least by 5000 B.C.
The last Early Archaic dart points of the Edwards Plateau were arguably the
Uvalde and Martindale8 styles, as well as unnamed wide-stemmed dart heads
otherwise shaped very much like Martindale points, and found at the Dan Baker
site (41CM104) on the Guadalupe River of the Plateau, lying just above Early
Split-Stem dart points of various sorts (Shirley Van der Veer, 1993 personal
communication).
Early Archaic burials from the eastern Edwards Plateau are uncommon, and
most come from Bering Sinkhole (Bement 1991) of Kerr County, on the
westernmost margin of the eastern half of the Plateau. At that site, three Early
Barbed dart points, as well as radiocarbon assays, help date some of the scattered human skeletal material to Early Archaic times. Significantly, a low or
moderate rate of tooth-enamel hypoptasia is indicated and the caaries rate is low
relative to that of later burials. Those data indicate little weaning stress and a
general diet fairly low in carbohydrates, lower than for the Early Archaic desert
people found at Seminole Sink in the Lower Pecos area (Turpin 1985). Moreover, ratios for stable-carbon isotopes argue for a low reliance on C3 plants and
animals consuming such vegetation; both sotol (in Texas) and acorns are classed
as C3.

The Middle Archaic Period
The short Middle Archaic period of some 1300 years commences around
3600 B.C. and can best be taken as a transitional epoch. Prikryl (1990:Figure 4)
likewise begins his newly defined Middle Archaic period for north-central Texas
at about that date, just before the heyday of Calf Creek dart points. Turning again
to the Plateau, the first dart-point style of the Middle Archaic was probably the
s At the Landslide site (41BL85), Martindale points tend to occur mainly in Stratum
V, deeper in the site terrace than Calf Creek/Bell specimens (Sorrow et al. 1967:Figure
72; Johnson 1991:154). At the Panther Springs Creek site (41BX228), whose stratigraphic
separation of point styles is admittedly imperfect, Martindale points (which are rare)
occur in Area M with Early Barbed points and below a single Calf Creek/Bell specimen
(Black and McGraw 1985:Table 48), but perhaps in mixed deposits. At the Camp Pearl
Wheat site (41KR243) Martindale and Uvalde dart points were found in the same isolated
stratum as a Calf Creek/Bell point (Collins et al. 1990:32-34), but the stratum in question
represents many years.

Johnson & Goode -- Edwards Plateau Holocene Climates & Archeological Periods

25

intrusive Calf Creek/Bell dart head. It was during the early part of the Middle
Archaic period that buffalo came briefly into the region, attracting hunters probably from the Eastern Woodland’s margins who introduced Calf Creek dart
heads of the Bell and Andice varieties?
My interpretation is that most of the Middle Archaic period was moderately moist but drying, as can be seen from the steady deposition of overbank
sediments on San Geronimo Creek (at the Jonas Terrace site) and from the
aggradation of stream terraces (creating alluvial Member C) at Cowhouse Creek
at Fort Hood, Texas. Furthermore, at the Jonas Terrace site of upland Medina
County, Middle Archaic sediments typically contained large quantities of a snail
(Oligyra orbiculata) preferring a wooded riparian or savanna environment,
which may speak for mesic weather conditions. The moist-environment snail
was largely replaced in the sedimentary column at 41ME29, around 2400 or
2300 B.C. or so, by a species of snail (Rabdotus mooreanus) much more tolerant of open spaces and drier conditions (Johnson 1994). The Middle Archaic
record of vertebrate life, if present at Hall’s Cave, cannot now be isolated
stratigraphically by acceptable radiocarbon assays.
My idea of a relatively mesic Middle Archaic period is somewhat at variance with Lee Nordt’s interpretations about Fort Hood vegetational changes, or
at least his ideas as to their magnitude (Nordt 1993:57-71). He finds a shift in
8~3C values for soil organics roughly between 4900 and 3800 B.C. (calibrated
years), producing readings for g~3C of -14.6, -14.5, -14.0, and -15.4 per rail
(Trench 19, Fort Hood Member C, approximately 0.32-1.53 m in depth). He
thinks that a substantial increase in the contribution of C4 plants to the biomass is
indicated, which Nordt believes is due to a decrease in trees and forbs (C3 plants)
locally, because of reduced rainfall and higher temperatures equatable with the
so-called Attithermal drought.
That interpretation is partially correct, since no mesic period is indicated by
the above ~3C values. An increase in rainfall would cause an expansion of trees
(with associated C3 grasses) on the creeks’ floodplains and low terraces
(Gehlbach, 1994 personal communication), changing stable-carbon isotope ratios to those indicating a dominance of C3 plants. Of course, increased moisture
would also foster lush upland grasses. The point I make, however, is that Nordt
may overstate the severity of the change seen in Trench 19. According to my
view of depositional and isotopic data from Fort Hood, the temporary shift in the
direction of C4 plants (surely grasses) sometime between 4900 and 3800 B.C.

9 In addition to the fact that the Calf Creek point type occurs with buffalo bones in
Oklahoma (Newsletter, Oklahoma Archeological Survey 1993), such an association exists
in central Texas. Feature 2 of the Landslide site (41BL85) was a stone baking heap with
several bison bones and a Calf Creek/Bell dart head directly atop its rocks (Sorrow et al.
1967:41). Additionally, Feature 26 of the Cmwenka site (41WM267) was an early earthen
fireplace with bison bones lying on it (Peter et al. 1982:8-260 to 8-261). It may be of the
same age as Feature 2 from the Landslide site.

was not the result of a major change in climate or vegetation. No clear-cut
Altithermal period is represented, either in Trench 19 or elsewhere in the eastern
part of central Texas (Gehlbach, 1994 personal communication). Consequently, I
conclude that the Plateau’s Middle Archaic climate was still somewhat mesic but
gradually drying, though around 4500 B.C. or so a fairly modest shift (in a
geological sense) toward temporary aridity occurred.
A gradual drift away from mesic conditions, in the Middle Archaic period,
is borne out by the development, mostly at the end of that time span, of a number of burned rock middens,~° whose presence elsewhere indicates the baking
largely (but not exclusively) of upland xerophytic plants that had increased their
range. According to sedimentary and snail information from the Jonas Terrace
site, mentioned above, the climate in late Middle Archaic times was not nearly
so dry as during the first part of the succeeding Late Archaic I subperiod. However, a steady and modest shift toward aridity could have put semi-succulents
on the road to becoming a significant food source in the latter half of the Middle
Archaic period, though not to the degree seen in Late Archaic days. Nevertheless, the weather shift was moderate enough not to affect the growth by flooding of headwater terraces in upland areas, at least until aggradation stopped just
before the Bulverde dart point style made its appearance on the eastern Edwards
Plateau.
In the eastern Plateau, scattered stands of sotol and other xerophytic plants
such as yucca and nopal persist even today under reasonably mesic conditions,
particularly in loose soil on southwestern slopes, and these stands could easily
expand if encouraged by drought to do so. The modern distribution of sotot
plants, which in the north includes parts of Bell County, is summarized usefully
by Goode (1991:87). The distribution of yucca is even greater, including as it
does fairly tight soils. One factor that has restricted the range of sotol plants a bit,
in recent times, is their past use as cattle feed by the region’s ranchers, as Ernest
Wilson (1930) documented for western parts of the Edwards Plateau. In some
areas of the Plateau the sotol population has been eliminated by the hand of man
and the tooth of ox.
As for regional prehistory, the Middle Archaic archeology of the eastern
Edwards Plateau was varied, and in one sense witnessed a transition from "antique" Early Archaic material cultures to "advanced" plant-collecting and hunting cultures of the Late Archaic period. The evidence for fairly rapid change

l0 Calling these features "burned rock middens" may be something of a misnomer (cf.
Kroesen and Schneider 1991:44, note 1), although that designation is retained here. In the
sense that burned rock middens are made up of rock debris from baking pits and basins,
they do not constitute "kitchen middens" of quotidian domestic detritus. However, the
contents of hearths and other kinds of domestic debris have been added to burned rock
middens at a number of sites, contributing sometimes extraordinary amounts of typical
kitchen midden garbage to the piles of burned rocks.

consists of the appearance in the region of Early Triangular dart heads11 and the
brief emergence of Merrell points (conceivably, however, of Early rather than
Middle Archaic age).12 There is also a profusion of probably Middle Archaic
dart-head styles, some of which have long and narrow rectangular stems, at the
Wounded Eye (41KR107) and Shep (41KR109) sites (Luke 1980), as well as
Cervenka (41WM267).~3 And later within the period, the La Jita~4 dart head
appears, which Glenn T. Goode believes to be of the same age as Travis and
Nolan dart heads, since it shares manufacturing features with them.
In the late part of the Middle Archaic, large and narrow Nolan-Travis dart
points were dominant in much of the Plateau, though local styles such as La Jita
seem partly to have taken their place at the southern edge of the Plateau and just
south of there. It is consequential that thick Nolan-Travis dart points, and their
long and narrow predecessors with rectangular tangs (as found at the Cervenka
site), portray a major stylistic and technological change in point making. Calf
Creek and Early Triangular specimens, made during the first part of the Middle
Archaic period, are wide-bladed and thin, and their blade surfaces were flaked
partly by pressure. The large, narrow, and thick dart heads which followed them
in the region could be well made (as in the case of Nolan specimens), but were
often knapped crudely (as in the case of many Travis dart points). In any case,
they are distinct from Early Archaic and early Middle Archaic dart-point styles.
Elton Prewitt (1993 personal communication) believes that the general style
of the first Nolan and Travis points appearing in central Texas may have been
borrowed from the Lower Pecos region, since beveled-stemmed and roughly
similar dart heads (mostly of Pandale type) may be more ancient there. For the
Lower Pecos region, calibrated dates for charcoal possibly associated (at least
stratigraphically) with Pandale points or their Nolan congeners cluster between
3800 B.C. and 3100 B.C. (Turpin 1991 :Table 1.1). The best radiocarbon assays

"At the Landslide site (41BL85), Early Triangular points/knives appear from their
stratigraphic position to be of approximately the same age as Calf Creek/Bell dart heads
(Sorrow et al. 1967:Figure 72). Additionally, most Early Triangular artifacts from the
John Ischy site (41WM49) were found below Nolan (upper Middle Archaic) points
(Sorrow 1969:Table 4-6), although the artifact count is low and perhaps unreliable. It is
reasonable to conclude, provisionally, that Early Triangular artifacts are of about the same
age as Calf Creek points or else slightly more modem. In so doing, the data from the
Landslide site are given great importance.
~2 Dart points of the so-termed Merrell type, and specimens rather like it, occur in a
mixed Early and Middle Archaic context at the site of that name (41WM2; Campbell
1948:Plate 3A, No. 9). From what we presently know about this style, it could be either
Early Archaic or early Middle Archaic in age, although my preference is for the latter.
~3 For illustrations of such miscellaneous styles that are particularly clear and useful,
see Peter (1982:Figure 14.1-3e, 14.1-4b, j and 14.1-5b).
~4The La Jita type was named by T.R. Hester (1971) for a Girl Scout camp and an
archeological site (41UV21) of that name. The word lajita is Spanish for "flagstone."

for Pandale points, however, may be Tx-2747, Tx-773, and Tx-2742 (Turpin
1991 :Table 1.7), which produced calendar dates falling between 3500 and 3200
B.C. Lacking conclusive evidence, I nonetheless believe that Nolan and Travis
dart heads are no earlier than 3000 B.C. on the eastern Edwards Plateau, if that
ancient.
It is possible to see a redefined Middle Archaic period, generally, as one in
which considerable borrowing of alien artifact styles took place. Additionally,
some outlanders with new tool styles may have intruded physically onto the
Plateau. In contrast, there is evidence for general stylistic continuity from one
century to another throughout large parts of the preceding Early Archaic period,
as said, although archeologists who think only in terms of types (rather than
broader stylistic traditions) can be blind to such trends.
It is apparent to all that mixed economies characterized the Middle Archaic
period. Nevertheless, toward the end of Middle Archaic days one can see evidence for the gathering of sizeable quantities of single plant resources. For
instance, a number of charred acorns were found in small man-made depressions
at site 41BN63 (Hester 1985), although most came from a single hollow. The
man-made holes were in the surface of a clay stratum, below a Late Archaic
Pedernales-Montell burned rock midden, and radiocarbon dating discloses their
terminal Middle Archaic age. Furthermore, the appearance of burned rock
middens points to an economic emphasis on collecting plants at appropriate
seasons, in quantities, and baking them in pit ovens. The people who made and
used large Nolan and Travis dart points occasionally baked (xerophytic?) plants
in stone-lined ovens, causing a certain quantity of burned rock middens to
accumulate.~5
Burial practices for the Middle Archaic period are most uncertain, at least
for the Edwards Plateau, itself. However, near the margin of the Plateau in
Uvalde County, on the western edge of the area of interest, is Mason Burial Cave
(41UV4). That deep sinkhole contained the earthly remains of 25 to 50 people
and a few Travis, Nolan, and triangular dart heads (Benfer and Benfer 1962). The
projectile points date at least some of the Mason Cave burials to the upper
Middle Archaic period.

~5 Burned rock middens with Nolan and/or Travis dart heads are known from several
locales, although at most eastern Plateau sites with rock middens, Nolan and Travis dart
points are found be!ow rock accumulations of Pedernales or Montell age. According to
G.T. Goode, Nolan or Travis specimens occun’ed in the Archaic burned rock midden
found at the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235); in an "upper" rock pile at the Millican
Bench site (41TV163) on a tributary of the Colorado River’s Bull Creek, at the very edge
of the Plateau (Frank A. Weir, 1993 personal communication); and within middens B, C,
and G at the Greenhaw site (41HY29) on a tributary of Onion Creek, near the eastern
verge of the Edwards Plateau (Weir 1979).

The Late Archaic Period

The lengthy and important Late Archaic period is divided into subperiods
I and II. The entire period, however, lasted nearly three millennia and can be
said to have commenced around 2300 B.C. with people who used Bulverde dart
points. That style appeared immediately after the regional climate had been
distressed by a sharp decrease either in yearly rainfall or in seasonal precipitation, and by an inferred rise in temperature portending the longish Late Archaic
I drought to follow. The classic Bulverde type, with its abrupt pressure flaking
and thin, wedge-shaped rectangular stem, may be intrusive onto the eastern
Edwards Plateau, perhaps coming from the prairies of northern or northeastern
Texas--the general area where Calf Creek points throve a thousand years earlier. Bulverde points were soon followed by specimens of the almost omnipresent Pedernales type.
Of the changes proposed herein, I foresee resistance most of all to the
reclassification of the Bulverde and Pedernales intervals as Late Archaic. Habits
have a tenacious life of their own and those intervals have been thought of as
Middle Archaic for nearly 30 years, in spite of the fact that the original period
assignment in the 1960s was arbitrary. In any case, I petition the reader to ponder
the reasons for extending the beginning date of the Late Archaic period back in
time. First, in the eastern United States a large human population and an efficient
economy have long distinguished a Late Archaic period dating earlier than the
Texan period of that name, and similar developments will be inferred for the
eastern Edwards Plateau perhaps during Bulverde times but certainly in the
Pedernales period. Second, strong continuity exists between Pedernales material
culture (and economics) and later Montell implements (and subsistence practices). The Montell interval has long been classed as Late Archaic.
The reader is referred to Johnson (1994), which documents the carry over of
specific facets of Pedernales dart-point manufacture and styling (most noticeably, blade shape) to later Montell specimens. (One says "dart heads" by habit,
although Pedernales and Montell specimens could have been used on thrusting
spears, rather than atlatl-thrown darts!) Moreover, the same large and thin billetmade knives were created both in Pedernales and Montell times. So one should
not let the new stem style of Montell dart points (a combination of Plains corner
notching and Plateau bifurcating) overshadow technological and stylistic continuities that link Montell with earlier point types. And equally as important as the
foregoing evidence is the continuance of Pedernales-period plant baking by
subsequent Montell folk, in a big way, in burned rock piles. Montell plant bakers
often worked in the selfsame middens that Pedernales folk had earlier accumulated with their oven- or pit-roasting activities. Reasonably, throughout the first
part of the Late Archaic period (from Pedernales through Montell days), economic and culture-historical clues point to the existence, on the eastern Plateau,
of ein Volk.

Daniel J. Prikryl (1990:Figure 24) initiates his Late Archaic period for
northern Texas at 1500 B.C.--earlier than is traditionally done in the central part
of the state, but not so early as proposed here. Interestingly, Pedernales projectile
heads typical of much of the early part of the Late Archaic period on the Edwards
Plateau do not occur in north-central Texas. It is possible that this type, which is
based on a particular kind of thinned or fluted tang with concave base, was
developed locally on the Edwards Plateau from the preceding Bulverde style. For
instance, specimens of an intermediate shape are illustrated by Gearhart
(1987:Figure 46d-e) for Williamson County. In any eventuality, Bulverde and
especially Pedernales folk (surely the same society at two different periods) lived
through the peak of the dry Edwards Interval. At this stage of understanding I do
not claim that the climate of the Edwards Interval can be traced northward from
the Plateau. However, the warm and dry climatic period in question corresponds
to a rapid rise in the Gulf’s sea level, which had taken place by 2200 B.C. or so,
and with a recognizable Gulf highstand (Ricklis 1993:66ff).
This adjustment in sea level may mirror hemispherical or global temperature changes, although the question has not been settled. According to sedimentary and other information from the Jonas Terrace site, the dry and hot climatic
shift, though seemingly presaged by incipient weather changes in that direction
during the latter part of the Middle Archaic, nonetheless struck the uplands of the
Edwards Plateau a considerable blow. Evidence for some such abruptness or
suddenness is seen at the Jonas Terrace site, where floodplain aggradation indicative of a relatively moist climate suddenly ceased (Johnson 1994). In
Bulverde times (not long before Pedernales points appeared), aggradation of
upland floodplains stopped and xerophytic plants seem to have completed their
extension over parts of the Plateau, where they must have thriven, as foretold by
E. Prewitt (n.d.) some years ago.
At the Jonas Terrace site, the main snail living on the terrace (Rabdotus
mooreanus) was of a type avoiding shady areas with trees, preferring open space.
However, the claim that a mesic snail (GlyphyalOtia umbilicata) at Bering Sinkhole in Kerr County was extirpated in Late Archaic I times, indicating a dry
climatic regimen, is unconvincingJ6 The absence of this snail from the pertinent
cave zones is apt to be a function of small sample size, since snails of all species
become rare at the indicated depths and Glyphyalhzia umbilicata is never abundant at any level.
The Late Archaic period at Hall’s Cave is not particularly easy to identify,
although a segment of deposits at least 0.25 m thick are of that age, at least
according to the two relevant radiocarbon assays of charcoal (see Figure 4).
Neither desert shrews nor mesic least shrews were present in any numbers in

~6 See Bement (1991:80, especially Table 6) for data on the occurrence of Bering
Sinkhole snails; the reader is also referred to the radiocarbon dates for that site (Bement
1991:Table 1).

31

Late Archaic zones, nor were vertebrates who required a mesic environment. The
climate during much of Late Archaic I times must have been very dry, since tile
least shrew returned to Hall’s Cave only later, perhaps near the end of the Late
Archaic period when conditions became wetter. The deposits of Patschke Bog of
Lee County are better dated for the period in question; that peat bog is situated in
Post Oak savanna (with some blackjack) east of the Blackland Prairie (Camper
1991). During Early and Middle Archaic times, a rise in percentages for oak and
grass pollen surely indicates progressive regional drying. However, in the Late
Archaic period that followed, grass pollen was both abundant and reasonably
stable in its percentages, apparently bespeaking a long period of submesic (perhaps arid) climate, with elevated temperatures and less precipitation.17
The end of overbank flooding and floodplain/terrace aggradation mentioned
for San Geronimo Creek (at 41ME29) and Fort Hood can be seen in other
localities, which deserve mention. Not too far beyond the Plateau, and about 15
miles south of San Antonio, the Medina River’s Applewhite Ten’ace preserves a
buried alluvial member which ceased aggrading during the period of concern,
probably at or near the beginning of the Edwards Interval. For the Medina, I
would date this cessation of flooding, which is surely a dryness indicator, to
sometime between 2700 B.C. and 2300 B.C., judging from the available radiocarbon assays (Thorns and Mandel 1992).
Closer to the Gulf coast, the Columbus Bend formation of the lower Colorado River is composed of several alluvial members of interest. According to
sometimes ambiguous radiocarbon assays for West Point and Columbus, Member 1 appears to have stopped its growth and become stable sometime between
3200 B.C. and 2500 B.C. (Blum 1992:156, 175-178, 189). In actuality, the
indicated dry period almost certainly corresponds to the Edwards Interval.
It may be that most (but not nearly all) of the manos and metates of the
Plateau, such as those found along the middle Colorado River above Austin, are
of Pedernales or Montell-point age and were used in milling unknown plant
parts, although manos also occur in some Nolan-Travis burned rock middens and
in numbers at the Early Archaic Sleeper site (Johnson 1991). This conclusion is
suggested, for example, by the apparent stratigraphic association of many milling
stones with Pedernales and/or Montell projectile heads at the shallow Toungate
(41TV33) burned rock site on the Colorado (Clark n.d.). Of course, locales are
known that have Pedernales points but no manos whatever, indicating that special economic chores were done at different "kinds of sites.

~7For Patschke Bog, a date of approximately 2550 B.C. (SI-5232) applies to the 1.101.20 m depth of Core 2, while an age of about 825 B.C. (SI-5231) comes from the 0.400.50 m depth of the same core (Camper 1991 :Table 2). Those are calibrated ages, figured
with an estimated 8~3C value of-25.0°/oo; the two age calculations are from depths
conesponding to high grass and oak pollen percentages, and bracket most of the Late
Archaic I subperiod.

Late Archaic burned rock middens grew in many places, and are made up of
heat-broken limestone rocks left over from baking yucca, sotol, various bulbs,
nopal tunas, etc., in rock-lined and sometimes rock-filled pits, sizeable hearths,
and basinsJ8 Sotol was certainly only one of a number of plants chosen for
baking and consumption. However, some piles of heat-broken baking rocks
came also to serve as garbage dumps and had spent hearth rocks and kitchen
midden trash added to them from time to time. Glenn T. Goode (1991:78)
believes he had good evidence for the dumping of discarded hearth stones and
human debris on the edge of an oven midden at the Heard Schoolhouse site
(41UV86). Dumped human residue is also found in other burned rock middens
(see provenience data for tools and other detritus in Peter et al. 1982:8-107 to 8129). For that reason, a number of burned rock middens of the eastern (and
western) Edwards Plateau contain quantities of animal bones, broken stone tools,
and flintknapping debris.
Recently, fragments of burned sotol leaves were identified for the burned
rock middens of the Jonas Terrace site and the Heard Schoolhouse site (41UV86)
on the Dry Frio River (P. Dering, 1993 personal communication), and it is
important to point out that the Jonas Terrace burned rock midden is not principally a dumping place. Few flint flakes or artifact parts were found among its
fire-broken stones, and for that reason one can be fairly certain that the burned
sotol was produced by pit (oven) baking and not dumped there with hearth
debris.
Mescalero Apaches and other aborigines did similar pit baking of xerophytic plants with heated rocks thousands of years later, and their behavior in
that regard is documented very well. Also recorded is their practice of drying
oven-cooked plants and then making bread from them. For fairly detailed and
fascinating ethnographic descriptions of rock-oven baking, the reader is directed
to Castetter and Opler (1936), as well as Basehart (1960) and Wilson (1930:6263). Additionally, Tunnell and Madrid (1990) supply interesting portrayals of the
present-day baking of sotol heads within rock-lined pits in Chihuahua, as a first
step in manufacturing soothingly delicious sotol liquor.
As a significant aside, the reader should consult Black et al. (1993:24-31)
for a reconstruction of the way burned rock middens grew through the repetitive
baking of plants in single places. The compelling argument of those writers, is
that the "domed middens" of central Texas (which lack visible surface pits) are
mainly rock-oven sites, nonetheless. Additionally, Black et a!. (1993:29) doubt
that acorns were processed in burned-rock middens:

~s Howard (1991:59 and Table 1) lists a number of burned rock middens with baking
pits or basins, most of which she calls "hearths." In addition, such baking features appear
in middens, some of which are of Late Archaic age: according to G.T. Goode, at the
Mustang Branch site (41HY209); at site 41BX52; at the Higgins site (41BX184; Black et
al. 1993:25); and at a number of newly excavated burned rock middens at Fort Hood (J.M.
Quigg, 1993 personal communication).

Johnson & Goode ~ Edwards Plateau Holocene Climates & Archeological Periods

Acorns, to generalize from North American ethnographic analogy, are
commonly parched, leached, simmered, and baked, but none of these
steps would seem to require a massive oven that holds heat for days.
Therefore, to us it seems unlikely that acorns represent the major resource associated with BRMs [burned rock middens].
It is entirely sensible to believe that the development of burned rock piles
had nothing to do with a California-style addiction to cooking acorn mush with
hot stones, or to leaching tannic acid from acorns with heated limestone.~9 Those
notions are mostly based on a partial agreement in the occurrence of oak trees
and some (but not all) burned rock middens in west-central Texas. The idea that
burned rock middens had to do with acorn processing is best summarized by
Creel (1991). Clearly, however, the explanation of large rock piles primarily as
acorn-processing features needs to be set aside pending more reasonable evidence, for the arguments that have been made are unconvincing. The mere
presence of a few charred acorns in occasional burned rock accumulations is not
a conclusive clue that limestone was heated principally to process those nuts.
(Howard [ 1991 :Table 8] reports charred acorns in a few sites with burned-rock
middens: the Indian Creek site [no trinomial], 41UV48, 41WM53, and 41WM56.)
Acorns are properly leached by being ground and having water poured through
the meal, by being soaked whole in water, or by being boiled with calcium in the
water.
That does not mean, however, that acorns were never dried at times on
existing burned rock middens or never burned with the fuel used to heat the
mound’s oven; acorns make a very hot fire. At any rate, the existence of a few
acorns in a burned rock midden can have a number of explanations that have
nothing to do with acorn cooking or leaching, such as their use as fuel or their
accidental inclusion in fire basins because of nearby, even overhanging, live oak
trees. The discovery, however, of charred leaf fragments of sotol (as well as
nopal seeds, plant bulbs, etc.) in a burned rock midden is a different matter.
Charred parts of such fragile plant are apt to represent debris left over from
baking, since other explanations of their presence would be farfetched.
Echoing the comments of Black and his fellow writers (above), I also state
that the idea that the Plateau’s aborigines would accumulate rock middens by
somehow processing acorns with heated limestone is a fatuous notion. Acorns
do not need to be baked in rock ovens or leached in them (assuming such to be

~9 Stone-boiling experiments conducted by S. Black, at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in 1993, produced fractured stones with saw-toothed sides (composed
of jagged interlocking fractures) that are very distinctive. On the other hand, burned rock
middens in central Texas contain fractured rock with squared-off faces, of a type
consistently produced by the direct and repeated application of heat. Apparently, the
limestone rock found in the middens of central Texas was not fractured by being dropped,
hot, in water.

34

possible), although the parching of acorns on hot rocks might help preserve them
for storage (by killing worms). A person familiar with acorn consumption in
the Northwest or California knows that the drying, leaching, and cooking of
acorns is a simple matter hardly warranting the kinds of efforts that would accumulate burned rock middens. Furthermore, the occurrence of burned rock
middens largely in live oak groves along streams, in west-central Texas, may
simply mean that both pit baking of xerophytic plants and the health of live oaks
demand a good source of water. In the region in question, live oaks may prefer
areas with a limestone bedrock capable of furnishing oven stones for baking
desert plants.
However dry the climate of the Edwards Interval, Part I of the Late Archaic
period (2300 B.C. to 600 B.C.) witnessed no hardships for the aborigines, who
apparently came to thrive on upland semi-succulents. Nevertheless, some data
(Bement 1991) indicate a less healthy diet for the period under consideration,
with too much in the way of carbohydrates (or sugars; sotol leaves produce sugar
when baked quite slowly). In any event, at certain seasons of the year people
continued to enjoy the nuts and game of the wooded river valleys, which were
not much affected by the inferred temperature rise. In fact, streams such as the
San Gabriel and Nueces rivers are known to have continued aggrading during
Late Archaic I times, at places not too far below the Plateau’s escarpment.2°
Certain Fort Hood streams also built up alluvial deposits (Member D1) of Late
Archaic I age (Nordt 1992:passim).
In conclusion, burned rock middens were much more abundant on the
eastern Edwards Plateau in Late Archaic I times than in any other period.2~
Nevertheless, in western Texas as well as Mason, Kerr, and Uvalde counties
(areas that continued to experience fairly xeric conditions !ong after this dry
period), burned rock middens commonly accumulated also in Post-Archaic days.
Thus some arrowhead-period burned rock middens are known from the western
border of what is here called the eastern Edwards Plateau. But on the eastern
Plateau proper, fewer burned rock middens built up in later times than during the
Late Archaic I period, and became less common than in the west. A burned rock

2o The Loeve-Fox site (41WM230), located within alluvial sediments of the San
Gabriel River, shows floodplain aggradation both before and during Pedernales times
(Prewitt !982a:Figure 5). And at the Anthon site (41UV60) on the Nueces River, G.T.
Goode reports that the river’s floodplain continued to build upwards during the Pedernales
period, after a pre-Pedernales pause. Both sites contain fine-grained sediments and are
situated not too far below the escarpment of the Edwards Plateau. Nearer the Gulf coast,
however, aggrading ceased on the Colorado River, presumably during the early part of the
Late Archaic period; that stream’s exposed floodplain consequently remained stable for
centuries. Evidence for this event appears, for example, at the top of truncated Alluvial
Member 1 at Columbus Bend, about 120 miles inland from the Gulf (Blum 1992:70, 156).

midden with central baking oven is known from the Mustang Branch site
(41HY209) near the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau (though the basin may
be later than the body of the midden), and apparently dates to terminal Late
Archaic or early Post-Archaic times. According to Goode, who took part in that
site’s excavations, Darl and Fairland dart heads, as welt as a few arrow points,
were found within the rock midden. Additionally, a few burned rock middens
possibly of Late Archaic II and/or Post-Archaic age have been reported from
Williamson County (Gearhart 1987:58, 78, 117-118).
Glenn T. Goode (1991) reviewed a few such Post-Archaic midden sites on
the southwestern or western edge of the eastern Edwards Plateau, discussing
their possible function in baking sotol heads. He conscientiously described the
Honey Creek site (41MS32) in Mason County and the Heard Schoolhouse site
(41UV86) in Uvalde County. It can be added that Scallorn arrowheads may have
occurred in a burned rock midden outside Hall’s Cave (see Figure 1). One can
argue that most Post-Archaic middens are largely tied to the remnant sotol fields
near, or west of, the far western edge of the present study region.
There is no evidence that the eastern Edwards Plateau, with its many springs
and streams, served as a refuge area (as has been suggested) for parched and
hungry outsiders during the dry Edwards Interval. Local Pedernales projectile
points and associated knife forms prevailed uniformly during the supposed peak
of the dry Edwards temperature maximum, and Plateau folk maintained a quite
uniform material culture. Had outlanders arrived in any numbers, a variety of
projectile point styles representing alien forms would surely occur on the Plateau
at this time, and they do not.
Further into the Late Archaic I subperiod, after Pedernales projectile heads
had given way to the related Marshall and (later) Montell styles,22 buffalo seem
to have appeared again in the eastern Edwards Plateau.23 And although the effects
of the dry climate of the Edwards Interval may have been lessening by that time,
the people using Marshall and Montell projectile points continued the Pedernalesperiod baking of semi-succulent xerophytic plants, and accumulated or added to
burned rock middens during the same period that they sometimes barbecued
buffalo. Obviously, the climate and vegetation were still fairly xeric.

22 The fact has gone largely unrecognized that broad-bladed Pedernales points,
Marshall dart heads, and Montell points are all made in the same way, by expert billet
thinning (Johnson 1994). Very thin and flat blades are produced which show large flake
scars from such billet work. According to G. T. Goode, the differently shaped stem of
Montell points can obscure the indicated continuity, which also appears among large and
flat, oval knives that run through Pedernales, Marshall, and Montell times.
23 On the Edwards Plateau, buffalo bones may be part of the Montell-period debris of
the John Ischy site (41WM49; Sorrow 1969:62) and the Jonas Terrace site (Johnson
1994). In the Lower Pecos region, Montell dart points are definitely associated with bison
bones at Bonfire Shelter (41VV218; Dibble and Lorrain 1968:42-55).

36

In bidding subperiod I adieu (though the Castroville style is formally
transitional,24 it can perhaps be put at the end of that subperiod), three additional
observations can be made. The first is that the Late Archaic I period lasted for
about 1700 years. The second is that the billet thinning of sizeable bifacial knives
and projectile heads saw its artistic and technological flowering during that
subperiod, making flint-knapping debris of the epoch easy to identify when it
occurs abundantly. The third is that the human population appears to have
increased during Late Archaic I times (see Weir’s data in Prewitt 1985:Figure
6A; also, for the Lower pecos area, consult Turpin 1990).
In the Late Archaic II subperiod (largely corresponding to the Middle
Woodland in eastern North America), which lasted from 600 B.C. to A.D. 600,
fairly mesic conditions had returned to all but the western and southwestern parts
of the Edwards Plateau, although some increase in moisture had already taken
place during Montell days. Local aborigines lost most or part of their former
supply of upland xerophytic plants. As said, plausibly towards the end of
subperiod II the moisture-loving least shrew returned to Hall’s Cave in Kerr
County. Burned rock middens no longer accumulated in very large numbers as
a consequence of pit baking, except in the far west and on the southwestern edge
of the eastern Plateau, and evidence of buffalo hunting has not yet been found
in the eastern Edwards Plateau for subperiod II. However, Marcos points of this
epoch (at least one of them!) occur with bison bones near San Angelo (Creel
1990:220)--which is quite a distance from the eastern Plateau.
It behooves me to say, once again, that Lee Nordt’s climatic notions do
not always run parallel to mine. His study (Nordt 1993:68 and Figure 4) of
changes in the biomass at Fort Hood during this period (specifically, around 200
B.C. [calibrated]) argues for a brief warming/drying trend, producing increases
in the relative abundance of C4 grasses. Those increases, relative to the abundance of trees and forbs, could well mirror mild drought conditions, although
other interpretations are at least possible. For instance, short-term increases in
rainfall could easily increase local C4 grass cover and make it denser, at the
expense of C3 weedy plants. Strangely, perhaps, the earlier dry Edwards Interval does not readily reveal itself in the ptant-biomass data from Fort Hood,
which is perhaps sufficiently far north to experience Plains-like or "northern"
long-term weather changes not felt in southern Central Texas--but I doubt it.
Quite possibly, the interval in question merely saw little sedimentary deposition in the Fort Hood area.

24 Statistical comparisons (Johnson 1994) demonstrate that the blades of Castroville
dart points are thicker, on the average, than Montell specimens and resemble yet later
styles in several respects. Castroville points also tend to have biconvex rather than flat
lateral cross sections, and frequently lack the large billet-flake scars of Montell dart
points. Additionally, evidence of pressure flaking appears on many Castroville blade
surfaces, but not those of Montel! points.

My rendition of Late Archaic II climate calls for somewhat moister
conditions than previously, to explain the active aggradation of floodplains in
many localities. And during the indicated time period, one of two things
happened. Either foreigners from the Southern Plains showed up with new styles
of projectile points and made themselves to home, or else Plateau residents
borrowed certain tricks and techniques of projectile making from outsiders.
Marcos dart heads came first to be made. In fact, Marcos dart heads are very
much like dart points of the same age from the Southern Plains. And later in
subperiod II, aborigines of the eastern Plateau used Frio and Ensor dart heads.
Although some of the foregoing styles find parallels in the dart points of Southern
Plains buffalo hunters (Hughes 1989), as said, evidence can also be identified in
subperiod II (mainly in Ensor-point and Frio-point times) of social intercourse in
an entirely different direction: with the eastern United States.
In subperiod II, evidence of spreading Eastern religious cults or ideas
appeared on the Southern Plains, eastern Texas, the Gulf Coastal Plain, and in a
small way even on the eastern Edwards Plateau. Some of the major markers are
exotic burials, foreign copper, elaborate bone ornaments, Gulf whelk shells, and
atlat! weights typically of exotic stone; most of these items were widely traded
throughout the eastern half of North America. However, only the last two items
are ordinarily reported for the Edwards Plateau25 (though an engraved bone pin
turned up nearby, in San Antonio), and the region’s spear-thrower weights are
often made of local rock. It is sometimes difficult to determine whether fancy
Late Archaic grave goods are linked to developments in the eastern U.S., since
elaborate Late Archaic I burial furniture apparently not so linked is known for the
Texas Gulf Coastal Plain. For example, at Landa Park in New Braunfels, a large
Archaic cemetery on the Locke farm (site 41 CM25) produced a whelk gorget and
a few other special artifacts in flexed burials (Texas Archeologicat Research
Laboratory files). But one cannot know whether this "ceremonial" material has
local Archaic roots or is connected to eastern U.S. religions and their spread.
Unfortunately, whelk shells and atlatl weights are hard to date on the
Plateau, itself, since nearly all represent surface finds or goods excavated by
collectors. However, a number of fancy bone and whelk-shell items have been
found at San Antonio, directly below the Plateau’s margin in Late Archaic II
burials (Lukowski 1988). And, significantly, decorated whelk-shell pendants and

~5 See Patterson (1937a). As an example of other recorded occurrences of atlatl
weights and whelk shells, there is the whelk columella from site 41HY51 (Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory files). And a limestone atlatl weight was found with
"Darl" points at the Smith Rockshelter (41TV42) (Suhm 1957:38 and Figure 8B).
Additionally, artifact collectors report a large number of whelk pendants and spearthrower weights from the Leon River, in Bell and Milam counties, seemingly associated
with Ensor and Marcos dart points. G. T. Goode reports that most of the atlatl weights are
of local stone, although a few (including a specimen made of purple quartzite) are of
foreign materia!.

38

atlatl stones are definitely associated with Late Archaic dart heads on the Southern
Plains,-’6 occurring also in Late Archaic II cemeteries near the central Texas Gulf
coast. The cemetery of greatest interest is Burial Group 2 at the Witte site
(41AU36; Hall 1981:83-90). As an important aside, it is noteworthy that Edwards
Plateau people of Late Archaic II days contributed a strictly local product to the
distinctive trading networks of the time: large and thin corner-tanged knives
worked bifacially from Edwards flint (Patterson 1936, 1937b; Hall 1981).
Additionally, many caches of bifacial preforms of Edwards flint, perhaps of this
age, have been found far and wide, often beyond the Edwards Plateau on the
southern edge of the Llano Estacado and at the western border of the Eastern
Woodlands (Miller 1993). The notion of trading networks is reviewed by Johnson
(1982:206-209).
In the eastern U.S., religious movements linked to the use of many of the
above items, and their long-range transport, are well dated to some part of the
time range from 200 B.C. to A.D. 500, which represents a major slice of the
Middle Woodland (Hopewell or Marksvilte) period of the East. In the eastern
Plateau, Ensor, Frio, and perhaps other dart points date within this time frame. In
eastern Texas, there is little doubt but that the Mossy Grove people who built the
Jonas Short burial mound (41SA101) were influenced strongly by this movement. Additionally, the elaborate bone and shell artifacts, and occasional atlatl
weights of Arkansas stone, found with people buried around the time of Christ at
the Ernest Witte site (41AU36) in Austin County, Texas, may comprise a peculiar regional expression of widely spreading Middle Woodland religious beliefs.
The important point is that the religious and ceremonial materials mentioned above, however locally varied, appear basically on one temporal plane. In
itself, that fact supports the notion of a related batch of interconnected religious
ideas involving the possession of special cult items eventually included with the
dead at burial. Of course, some items of whelk shell and other conceivably
ceremonial and religious objects were known on the Texas coastal plain during
earlier periods, and in the East both before and after Middle Woodland (Late
Archaic II) times. Yet that fact is largely immaterial to the present argument, for
the Texas material highlighted here is all approximately contemporaneous, and is
tied together at least by Middle Woodland atlatl weights (often of Arkansas
stone) perceived to have been religious paraphernalia.
To explain the appearance of elaborate ceremonial goods in Texas just in
terms of local economic developments, the growth of farflung trading networks,
an increase in human population, the development of a hierarchical social organization or power structure, or the rise of a sedentary life style (e.g., Hall 1981) is

26 The best publications on the subject are those of Ray (1936), Pro’sons et al. (1979),
and Redding and Parker (1991). The first article describes corner-notched dart heads,
whelk pendants, and atlatl weights burned with a human corpse. The last reports a sidenotched Late Archaic dart point found in a human cremation along with small shell beads
and an elaborately worked atlatl weight of stone.

Johnson & Goode ~ Edwards Plateau Holocene Climates & Archeological Periods

to misunderstand the issue. It may be true that a complex cult with a rich material
expression only evolves within a complex social system like that of the Hopewell
people; but it is also true that such a belief system can spread to almost any kind
of society. Hence one finds whelk ornaments and atlatl weights of foreign stone
in cremations of Southern Plains hunting people, and very occasionally in sites of
the hunting-and-gathering aborigines of the Edwards Plateau.
Human skeletons probably dating to Late Archaic times have been found at
three sites on or very near the eastern Edwards Plateau. The first is Bering
Sinkhole (Bement 1991) at the western edge of the eastern part of the Plateau.
The results of analyses done on human skeletal parts conceivably dating to
subperiod I are engrossing. Teeth show a high rate of enamel hypoplasia, as well
as a high caries rate. Stable-carbon isotope ratios argue for a much greater dietary
reliance on C3 plants than could be deduced for Early Archaic burials from the
same sinkhole. Consequently there was considerable weaning stress for young
children (the hypoplasia), as happens with large populations, and for most of the
deceased a high carbohydrate or sugar diet is indicated which likely included
either sotol/yucca/agave or acorns, in addition to animals eating C3 plants.
Hitzfelder Cave (41BX26), with a sinkhole entrance, contained parts of 30
to 50 bodies, some of which must date to the Late Archaic I and II subperiods. A
Pedernales projectile point and a Marshall point were among the few projectile
heads that were observed (Givens 1968; Collins 1970), as were three Frio points
ofsubperiod II. Considerably to the southeast of the Plateau, on the Gulf
Coastal Plain, Late Archaic II cemeteries sometimes have burials with elaborate
burial furniture that includes decorated whelk-shell pendants, incised bone wands
and pins, and atlatl weights made of Arkansas stone (e.g., Hall !981:29-92).
Interestingly, the third Late Archaic burial site to be mentioned on or near the
Plateau had burials resembling the elaborate Coastal Plain kind, although the
limited excavations turned up the remains of only 12 or 13 bodies. The Olmos
Dam site (41BX1; Lukowski 1988) is an open locale on a stream bank within the
city of San Antonio, only a few miles south of the Plateau’s escarpment. Most of
the site’s bodies had been placed in graves, resting on either side, in a flexed or
semi-flexed position with head to the northeast or east. Importantly, the bodies of
Burial Group 2 at the Witte site were oriented similarly, expressing a shared
religious preference. Found with the Olmos Dam bodies, variously, were grinding slabs, whelk pendants and columellas, a mussel pendant, a bone awl or
hairpin, and chert cobbles. Remarkably, piles of antlers rested over some bodies
and covered all but the heads of adults. Burial goods and the well-associated
radiocarbon dates indicate a Late Archaic II age for the cemetery, near the time
of Christ.

The Post-Archaic Era
I provisionally stop the Late Archaic period around A.D. 600, just before
arrowheads such as the Sabinal and Edwards styles arrived onto the eastern

40

Texas Archeological Society

Edwards Plateau or were developed there. If Edwards and similar points were
indeed the first true arrowheads on the Plateau, the regional acceptance of the
bow was only slightly tardy from a continental perspective. The date of the
bow’s advent in eastern North American is usually said to fall between A.D.
500 and A.D. 800 (Shott 1993:425), and Edwards points appeared around A.D.
700 or 800 at the Plateau’s Rainey Sinkhole (41BN33; Henderson n.d.). Nevertheless, one should underscore the fact that some cultural and considerable economic continuity tied the end of the Late Archaic period with what came directly
afterwards. In fact, of all the period boundaries set in the present paper, that for
the ending of the Late Archaic II subperiod is the most subjective and bothersome. For one thing, human culture did not change greatly after the beginning
of that interval down through the days when Scallorn arrowheads were in vogue.
If the informed reader wishes to terminate the Late Archaic period at A.D. 1200,
I will not argue. Or if the reader wants to stop the period at around A.D. 400 (or
later), when very small "dart" points of the Darl and Figueroa sort appear in the
region, that is another possibility. Those small points may actually represent the
first arrowheads to materialize locally. The appearance of small dart points at
this time is also documented for north-central Texas (Prikryl 1990:56) and other
regions.
In any case, human life on and just below the eastern Edwards Plateau
changed in small ways in the Edwards-Scallorn part of the Post-Archaic Era.
First, my impression is that the population increased a bit, although I cannot
prove it. If the human population grew, the cause may have been a quite mesic
climate favorable for deer and mast. I doubt seriously that the acceptance of the
bow, locally, had anything to do with it, although it is a clearly more efficient
or effective hunting instrument than the atlatl and dartY Some communities consequently came into competition and battled one another, so much so that the
demise of quite a few people found in Scallorn-period cemeteries was due to a
peppering of arrows. Prewitt (1982b:Table 4) lists a number of burials with
bodies apparently pierced by arrows. Whatever else transpired, the material
culture of the people who made and used Edwards and Scallorn arrowheads was
not very different from that of Plateau people who lived during Late Archaic II
days, although arrowhead-period knapping was a bit different from what went

27 For strong but exaggerated warnings against accepting the idea of an increase in the
efficiency of bow hunting over dm’t hunting, see Shott (1993). I suspect, however, that the
bow was indeed much more efficient that the atlatl for hunting. But this added efficiency
may well have expressed itself in increased accuracy and the need for a given hunter to
spend much less time on the chase than otherwise. There is no compelling need to assume
a necessary increase in the number of animals killed (just because it became easier to hunt
them), or an increase in acquired calories. Prehistoric Texan aborigines were unacquainted
with Marx’s notions about economic production and had not heard of "maximum foraging
efficiency."

before it. Bifacial flint knives (with convex or straight bases) of early PostArchaic age are smaller than many of their Late Archaic counterparts.
The climate continued to be mesic until around A.D. 1200, when a drought
affected at least parts of the Edwards Plateau. Buffalo came back onto the Plateau soon thereafter and stayed, even after climatic conditions may have reverted
to the region’s near-mesic norm between A.D. 1300 and 1400.2s The Archaicseeming life style of the Scallorn folk was replaced by buffalo hunting and foraging by smallish groups of Toyah-culture people. The latter made true flint
blades by direct percussion, manufactured a bit of pottery of seeming Southwestern shape and finish, and used bevel-edged knives and sandstone shaft
abraders typical of the Southwest’s eastern margin and of the Plains Village
region. No Archaic Era blade industries are yet known on the Edwards Plateau
(Collins and Headrick 1992:27), nor have many pottery vessels been discovered that are older than Toyah ceramics. The best example is a thick-walled
beaker (Black and McGraw 1985:188-189 and Figure 41), from the Panther
Springs Creek site (41BX228), built up by plastering the inside and outside of
very thick clay ropes in Tchefuncte style. The present historical narrative concludes at A.D. 1600, near the end of Toyah days when Perdiz arrowheads were
in vogue.
I close by affirming that the eastern Edwards Plateau has been the
proscenium and stage for a basically low-key Native American drama unfolding
between 6500 B.C. and A.D. 1600. The Plateau is just beyond the margin of the
horticultural Eastern Woodlands, and gardening did not develop locally during
this lengthy epoch except ephemerally among Post-Archaic buffalo hunters of
the Toyah culture, as well as later Apaches.29 As a wide transitional zone
composed both of arboreal and prairie elements, the well-watered eastern half of
the Edwards Plateau ordinarily furnished ample plant and animal food for a
moderately sized human population practicing Archaic hunting and gathering
methods. The success of local hunting-and-collecting economies is surely one

.,8 After a period of erosion perhaps in the twelfth or thirteenth century (inferred date),
the Ford Alluvium (Member E) of Fort Hood was laid down during a moderately mesic
period beginning sometime after A.D. 1300 (Nordt 1992:76-77). Nordt (1992:67) notes
that "... radiocarbon ages from Fort Hood demonstrate that stream metamorphosis, and
possible brief channel trenching, occurred shortly after 1000 B.P. and that channel and
overbank filling has been proceeding since that time." This overbank filling indicates
greater precipitation after A.D. 1300 (my dating).
29 This statement is too strong. Apache-type ephemeral gardening could have been
practiced here and there on the Eastern Plateau during Late Archaic times, without leaving
many recognizable archeological clues. It is altogether too soon to disregard three pollen
grains of Zea mays (Indian corn) recovered from water used to wash a Late Archaic
milling stone from the Wild Turkey Midden (41M18: Howard 1991:63). Holloway
(1988:8) seems ready to do just that, but the occurrence of the grains on a grinding stone
argues that they were original adherents.

reason why pottery was so tardily accepted by aborigines of the Plateau, and
serious horticulture not at all.
Naturally, being a climatic and vegetational borderland, the Plateau was
susceptible to changes caused by lengthy fluctuations in precipitation. More than
at any other time, it was during the dry Edwards climatic interval, whose peak
may have occurred around 1900 B.C., that aboriginal economics changed to a
degree and an increasing population seemingly came to rely quite regularly on
upland xerophytic and other plants as food staples--though they had sometimes
been collected previously, as well. Few places, however, are ever insulated
against all outside influence. During three periods and maybe more, bison came
into the region, no doubt to the delight of aboriginal gourmands and talented (or
cold) hide workers. And at another time Edwards Plateau people felt the touch of
cultural and religious developments reaching them from the Coastal Plain below
the Plateau and indirectly from the Eastern Woodlands. Additional regions such
as the Great Plains also affected Plateau folk during (and maybe just after)
periods of bison presence, and the stone tools of Plainsmen were occasionally
imitated by Plateau artifact makers.
By temperately redefining the content and boundaries of local culture periods to accommodate recent knowledge, and by dating both the culture periods
and the region’s climatic episodes better than heretofore, human life and its
history on the Plateau can be viewed in a clearer light. It is hoped that the stage
is now set for increasing the candle power of that light with new research. Some
day, acceptable and well-founded research will surely be done about prehistoric
social and community organization on the eastern Edwards Plateau, although
that day of fable lies (if anywhere) in a most uncertain future, somewhere over
the rainbow.
