MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Brushy Creek Ranch Investments, Ltd. (BCRI), proposes to develop the Brushy Creek
Business Park tract, an approximately 45-hectare (ha) (112-acre [ac]) tract just west of Hutto,
Williamson County, Texas, into a commercial business park. The tract is situated on the south
side of State Highway (SH) 79 and the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks. The eastern and
southern boundaries of the property are loosely framed by County Road (CR) 123, and Brushy
Creek flows along the southern boundary. A previous jurisdictional determination confirmed the
presence of “waters of the US” on the tract. These “waters of the US” would be adversely
impacted by the proposed development of the property and are subject to permitting under
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA); as such, they fall under the jurisdiction of the US
Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). While the 45-ha (112-ac) Brushy Creek
Business Park tract is currently privately owned, those portions of the overall development
defined as “waters of the US” have been determined to fall under federal jurisdiction. The
proposed development in the vicinity of the jurisdictional waterways therefore represents a
publicly sponsored undertaking, and BCRI was required to evaluate the potential of the
proposed project to adversely affect significant cultural resources within or adjacent to the
jurisdictional waterways on the property pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
The 45-ha (112-ac) Brushy Creek Business Park tract is privately owned, and no federal
or state lands or funding are being utilized in support of the proposed development. The Area of
Potential Effect (APE) therefore consists only of those areas within the overall development
defined as “waters of the US” that are subject to permitting by the USACE under Section 404 of
the CWA. Identified “waters of the US” on the tract consist of 3 stream segments, including an
approximately 396-meter (m) (1,300-foot [ft]) segment of McNutt Creek, a 457-m (1,500-ft)
segment of an unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek, and a 229-m (750-ft) intermittent drainage or
slough that drains a small portion of the terrace north of Brushy Creek into McNutt Creek. The
APE therefore consists of a linear total of 1,082 m (3,550 ft) of jurisdictional waterways plus a
30-m (100-ft) buffer zone on each side of the defined beds and banks of each stream. McNutt
Creek exhibits an approximately 9-m- (30-ft-) wide high-water mark, the unnamed tributary of
Brushy Creek has a jurisdictional width of approximately 5 m (15 ft), and the unnamed tributary
of McNutt Creek has a jurisdictional width of approximately 2 m (8 ft). Thus, the jurisdictional
areas surrounding the 3 stream channels—including 2.8 ha (6.9 ac) of McNutt Creek (396 m
[1,300 ft] long by 70 m [230 ft] wide), 3.0 ha (7.4 ac) of the unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek

Management Summary

(457-m [1,500 ft] long by 66 m [215 ft] wide), and 1.5 ha (3.6 ac) of the unnamed tributary of
McNutt Creek (229 m [750 ft] long by 63 m [208 ft] wide)—cover a total area of 7.3 ha (17.9 ac).
To meet its responsibilities under Section 106 of the NHPA, BCRI contracted with
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to conduct an intensive cultural resource survey
of the APE, which consists of the 7.2 ha (17.9 ac) of jurisdictional areas surrounding the
combined linear 1,082 m (3,550 ft) of “waters of the US” on the Brushy Creek Business Park
tract. On 27 December 2006, Horizon archeologists Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema, under
the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive survey
of the APE to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the
proposed construction project. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the APE and thoroughly
examined the modern ground surface for historic and prehistoric artifacts, cultural features, or
other evidence of past cultural activity. Horizon excavated a total of 41 shovel tests during the
survey, including 16 shovel tests along the McNutt Creek segment and 25 shovel tests along
the unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek tributary segment, thereby exceeding the Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) for a project area of this size. Three of
the 25 shovel tests excavated along the Brushy Creek tributary segment were actually
excavated slightly west of the boundary of the APE to examine some natural topographic rises.
No shovel tests were excavated along the unnamed tributary of the McNutt Creek segment of
the APE due to the erosional context of this area and the ubiquity of exposed bedrock on the
modern ground surface.
At the time of the survey, the sky was clear and the weather amicable. Non-streambed
portions of the APE were covered in mixed grasses and isolated stands of deciduous hardwood
trees; however, relatively little topsoil was present in the project area, and the underlying chalky
and marly bedrock was exposed in many areas. Ground surface visibility ranged from 100% in
areas where soils had been completely washed away via stream action, exposing the bedrock
on the modern ground surface, to near 0% where native grasses covered the ground surface.
Shovel testing revealed thin, highly eroded, surficial deposits of Holocene sediments overlying
limestone bedrock and fractured, indurated bedrock at depths of 5 to 40 centimeters below
surface (cmbs). Surface sediments consisted of moist black clay or loamy clay to moist, dark
brown silty clay. Limestone gravels deriving from the fractured bedrock substrate in the area
were abundant in the thin soil lenses overlying the bedrock.
Based on the results of the intensive cultural resource survey of the proposed APE, no
potentially significant archeological resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking.
No new cultural resource sites were identified in the APE as a result of the survey, and no
previously recorded sites are present in APE.
One historic-age cemetery, designated as the “McNeil Cemetery” in Texas Historical
Commission (THC) files and as the “McNeill-Allen Cemetery” on a small sign hanging from the
fence next to the cemetery gate, is present on the proposed 45-ha (112-ac) Brushy Creek
Business Park tract about 91 m (300 ft) southeast of the crossing of SH 79 over McNutt Creek.
While this cemetery is located on the privately owned Brushy Creek Business Park tract, it is
situated approximately 40 m (131 ft) east of the boundary of the portion of the APE associated
with McNutt Creek. As such, this cemetery is not within the APE of the proposed undertaking.

Examination of legible headstones indicates that inhumations extending from 1853 to 1895 are
present within the cemetery. One of the graves in the cemetery is that of Major Robert McNutt,
a historically important personage in the history of Texas. While a historic plaque has been
erected at the head of McNutt’s grave commemorating his service in the Battle of San Jacinto,
this cemetery is not listed as a Texas Historic Cemetery. While the McNeill-Allen cemetery is
not located within the APE defined by Section 404 jurisdictional areas, BRCI has indicated that it
plans not to disturb the McNeill-Allen cemetery during development of the Brushy Creek
Business Park property.
No cultural resources of any kind, including prehistoric or historic archeological sites,
isolated occurrences of artifacts, or historic structures or objects, were identified as a result of
the intensive archeological survey of the APE. No further cultural resource investigations are
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, in the event that human
skeletal remains, direct or indirect signs of human burial, or burial furniture are inadvertently
discovered during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of project-related facilities within
the APE, all work in the vicinity of the discovery should cease immediately and the USACE and
THC should be notified.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Brushy Creek Ranch Investments, Ltd. (BCRI), proposes to develop the Brushy Creek
Business Park tract, an approximately 45-hectare (ha) (112-acre [ac]) tract just west of Hutto,
Williamson County, Texas, into a commercial business park (Figure 1). The tract is situated on
the south side of State Highway (SH) 79 and the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks. The eastern

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The proposed Brushy Creek Business Park is located along SH 79 approximately
midway between the cities of Hutto and Round Rock in southern Williamson County, Texas.
Williamson County is situated near the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain (Hill 1901; Hill
and Vaughn 1900; Johnson 1931:125), near the center of Texas and close to the common
junction of 3 significant physiographic provinces—the Blackland Prairie, the Edwards Plateau,
and the Lampasas Cut Plain. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated
between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling
land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the
Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is
an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms
and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are
associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between
uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer
rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in
others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major
ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
Specifically, the project area is located within the Lampasas Cut Plain province, a
roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in Central and North-Central Texas situated
between the Brazos and Colorado rivers. The Lampasas Cut Plain forms a limestone upland
that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries, resulting in landforms
characterized by moderately broad, shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and
supports a mixed savanna flora, whereas soil is moderately deep on valley floors, where it
supports mixed riparian woodlands and forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and
rockshelters, but such are neither common nor extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but
not widespread across the Lampasas Cut Plain and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the study area is situated within the Brazos River basin. Brushy Creek
flows along the southern boundary of the site. Brushy Creek flows to the southeast toward the
City of Couplan, Texas, at which point it turns northeast, discharging into the San Gabriel River
north of Rockdale, Texas. From this point, the San Gabriel River flows roughly 56 km (35 mi)
east-northeast, discharging into the Brazos River near Hearne, Texas. The Brazos River, in

turn, flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately
discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of East Matagorda Bay.
The project area is situated on the northern terrace of Brushy Creek adjacent to the
stream valleys of McNutt Creek and an unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek. Elevations across
the project area range from about 189 to 198 m (620 to 650 ft) above mean sea level (amsl).

2.1

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Multiple geological formations are associated with the Lampasas Cut Plain
physiographic province in which the project area is located. In general, the bedrock throughout
Central Texas is composed of Upper Cretaceous formations that dip slightly to the east and are
predominantly composed of calcareous clay, shale, limestone, and marl, with a small portion of
sandstone (Sellards et al. 1932). On the surface, these formations weather into a rounded,
gently rolling topography with a few bluff faces exposed in stream valleys where more resistant
strata are present. These geologic units are overlain in some areas by unconsolidated
Quaternary alluvial floodplain and fluviatile terrace deposits.
Specifically, the project area is underlain predominantly by the Austin Chalk Formation,
though the valley of McNutt Creek is mapped as Alluvium (Proctor et al. 1974). The upper and
lower parts of the Austin Chalk Formation consist of massive, light-gray chalk with some
interbeds of calcareous clay with scarce marine megafossils. The middle part of the formation
consists predominantly of thin-bedded marl with interbeds of massive, light-gray chalk that
weathers to white with scarce marine megafossils.
The Austin Chalk Formation is
approximately 91 m (300 ft) thick. Within many of the more prominent stream systems in the
region, such as McNutt Creek, the underlying sedimentary bedrock is capped by Holocene
fluviatile floodplain and terrace deposits consisting variously of clay, silt, sand, and gravel.
Soil in Williamson County, Texas, formed in several types of parent material (Werchan
and Coker 1983). In the south-central part of the county, where the project area is located, the
parent material derives largely from chalk, marl, limestone, marly limestone, and mudstone.
The project area is underlain by the Austin-Houston Black-Castephen soil association (Werchan
and Coker 1983), which is composed of shallow to deep, calcareous, clayey soils that formed in
marine chalk, marl, shale, and clay, and is located primarily on uplands. Austin soils make up
about 18% of this map unit and consist of calcareous, dark grayish-brown silty clay underlain by
yellowish-brown silty clay, which in turn is underlain by chalk or chalky marl. Houston Black
soils comprise about 23% of the soil association and consist of calcareous, dark gray clay
underlain by calcareous, dark grayish-brown clay overlying mottled, grayish-brown clay.
Castephen soils constitute about 10% of the map unit and consist of calcareous, dark brown,
silty clay underlain by very pale brown interbedded chalk and loamy marl. The remainder of the
Austin-Houston Black-Castephen Association consists of a mixture of Eddy, Krum, Oakalla, and
Whitewright soils.
Specifically, the project area is situated on 2 distinct soil units (Werchan and Coker
1983). The floodplain of McNutt Creek consists of Oakalla soils, frequently flooded (Of), a
nearly level soil found on long, narrow bottomlands that are flooded several times annually after

heavy rains. The upper layer typically consists of dark grayish-brown to dark brown silty clay
loam about 86 centimeters (cm) (34 in) thick underlain by grayish-brown silty clay loam
alternating with silty clay to a depth of 152 cm (60 in) with a few seams of very pale brown
sandier material. The soil is calcareous and moderately alkaline throughout. The remainder of
the project area, including the unnamed tributaries of Brushy and McNutt creeks, is situated on
Sunev silty clay loam, 0 to 1% slopes (SuA), a nearly level soil found on high stream terraces.
This soil generally has a dark grayish-brown silty clay loam upper layer about 46 cm (18 in) thick
underlain by light yellowish-brown to reddish-yellow silty clay loam, with large amounts of
calcium carbonate in the lower part.

2.2

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Williamson County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer,
and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in western
Williamson County. Average annual precipitation totals 81 cm (32 in) and temperature
averages 19°Celcius (C) (67°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the
warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier

periods lasting from 3 to 7 years occurred, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm
(12 to 25 in) followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce large amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an
18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge
that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture
is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.3

BIOTA

The project area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the
limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Williamson County.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.
Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat
snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake,
copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green tree frog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and
antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are
no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of
North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly
through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late

PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The

first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased
participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that
heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Williamson County were the Tonkawa
Indians.1 The Tonkawa traditionally followed buffalo herds on foot and periodically set fire to the
prairie to aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, however, they made the transition to
a horse-based culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Decimated by European diseases
and by warfare with the Cherokee and Comanche, the Tonkawa were generally friendly towards
the early settlers of Williamson County but were nevertheless removed from Central Texas by
the 1850s. Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would
become Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Lipan Apaches
ranged through the western part of present Williamson County, and after Spanish missions were
established on the San Gabriel River in the 18th century, the Indians frequently raided the
missions for horses. Their enemies, the Comanches, arrived in the area in the 18th century and
lived in parts of the territory of Williamson County until as late as 1838. After they were crowded
out by Anglo settlers, the Comanches continued to raid settlements in the county until the
1860s. There also appear to have been small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and
Mayeye Indians living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the
16th century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt.
Alonso De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas
that would serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route
passed through the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River
and was called Camino de Arriba. In 1716, 2 explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau
de St. Denis and Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped
on Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas
Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid18th century and occupied a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just over the
eastern border of Williamson County in present-day Milam County, and the area was
extensively explored by the Spanish. During the Mexican period, parts of the county were
awarded as land grants, first to several Mexican families, then as part of Robertson’s colony, but
no settlement resulted from these grants.
Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in

what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post.
The post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by Dr. Thomas Kenney
and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney’s Fort, on Brushy Creek near the site of
the present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on Brushy
Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept Anglo settlement in check, and a number of
the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx
of settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western
Milam County, and, in the early months of that year, 107 of them signed a petition to organize a
new county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was
considerably closer to them than Milam County, the Texas legislature established Williamson
County on 13 March 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson.
Georgetown, the county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court
was in session by October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a
population of 1,379 Anglos and 155 slaves living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel. As was common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage
was used to grow corn. Three families owned 15 or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and
subsistence agriculture remained the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the settlers had
moved to Texas from other southern states, particularly Tennessee, a substantial contingent
came from Vermilion County, Illinois, and this latter group remained pro-Union and Republican
in its political orientation during the secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage
and was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. The Anglo population tripled between 1850
and 1860 to 3,638, while the slave population grew even more dramatically to 891, 6 times the
number of slaves in 1850. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and reflected the county’s
geographical diversity. Farmers used the rich Blackland soils in the eastern half of the county to
grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in
1860, and it was not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found
large herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching for both home consumption and the
market was widespread throughout the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county
ranches had more than tripled from 11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the
number of sheep grew from 2,937 producing 3,499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and
32,994 pounds of wool in 1860.
Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession crisis,
divisions that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist sentiment was
strong in the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas
Constitutional Union party meeting in Round Rock in 1860. One of the county’s delegates to the
secession convention, Thomas Proctor Hughes, was among the 8 who voted against the

12

050006_arch_survey_report.docx

ordinance of secession. When the ordinance was referred to a statewide election, Williamson
County was one of 19 counties to oppose it, rejecting secession by 480 to 349 votes. When the
war came, most of the citizens of Williamson County supported the Confederate cause, and at
least 5 companies were raised in the county; an independent “spy” company under James O.
Rice, a company of Texas Rangers for border defense under William C. Dalrymple, and
companies in the Fourth, Seventh, and Sixteenth Texas Cavalry regiments. While some of
those who had opposed secession became active Confederate supporters, others remained
loyal to the Union and fled to Mexico or the North, and a number enlisted in the Union army. In
July 1863, 8 Williamson County men were caught by Confederate troops while traveling to
Mexico and were hung near Bandera, Texas, and other Unionists were persecuted during the
war. The pattern of violence within the community continued into the summer following the end
of the war, when several men were arrested for “flagrant crimes” and “illegal persecution of
Union men.” In September 1865, a mass meeting of the citizens of Williamson County was held
on the San Gabriel River near Georgetown, and the gathering set a general tone of
reconciliation, which seems to have characterized the Reconstruction period in Williamson
County, a period that ended with the return of county government to conservative Democratic
control in 1869. Freed slaves formed several new communities, and the county seems to have
been free of much of the political and racial strife that occurred in other Texas counties during
Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a great deal of crime, much of it violent, in the
later 19th century. Horse and cattle thieves and some of the more famous outlaws of the day,
such as Sam Bass and John Wesley Hardin, preyed on the property of citizens, and long-term
family feuds and drunken brawls at the various saloons in the towns added to the toll of
homicides.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. The total value of farms had fallen from
$833,418 to $389,239 and the value of livestock from $823,653 to $341,794. The economic
recovery in the 1870s was aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic
expansion of cotton farming. Various feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail passed through
Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed through or originated in the county from the
1860s through the early 1880s. With the coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s,
Taylor, in the eastern part of the county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade.
Cattle-raising, after declining somewhat in importance in the early 20th century, was again a
major part of the agricultural economy by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record
65,093 cattle. Sheep- and goat-raising followed a similar pattern. Sheep ranching recovered its
pre-war level by 1880 and peaked at 39,961 sheep and 171,752 pounds of wool in 1890, then
declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to 13,397 sheep and 39,458 pounds in 1920.
The industry revived in the 1930s and reached a new high of 59,919 sheep and 336,494 pounds
of wool in 1959. Mohair became a significant agricultural product by 1930 and reached a peak
in 1959, when 44,668 goats produced 209,098 pounds of mohair. Cotton, the second boom
industry in Williamson County, developed at about the same time as the cattle industry. As
early as 1869, the editor of the Georgetown Watchman was advising farmers to “make cotton,
but do not, by any means, neglect the grain crop-diversity.” Cotton production, which had been
insignificant before the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880, 33,945 bales in

HJN 050006 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

1890, and 80,514 bales in 1900. In 1900 to 1901, Williamson County ginned more cotton than
any county in Texas except Ellis County. The number of improved acres increased almost
tenfold from 1870 to 1880 and doubled again to 306,881 acres by 1890. The proportion of
cropland used for cotton production moved from about one-third of the total in 1880 to a high of
77% in 1910, and cotton was grown on 73% of the cropland as late as 1930. Dramatic changes
in land tenure attended the shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1,183 of the 1,538 farms,
or 77%, were still worked by owners. By 1890, only 43% of the farms were operated by owners,
and the percentage of owner-operators remained at 40% until the 1920s, when it dropped still
further to 29% in 1930. Farm tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with
the shift away from cotton and other staple crops and by 1959 had dropped to 36% of the
county’s farmers.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later 19th century. The International-Great Northern Railroad,
which later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the eastern part of the
county in 1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson County’s third largest city) and
Hutto and to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in eastern Williamson
County to commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway, which was
eventually consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s
and aided in the development of Taylor, Granger, and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor
throughout the county in the early 20th century. There were 11,882 automobiles in the county
by 1930, and extensive improvements, including blacktopping, of all major roads took place in
the 1930s.
The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the influx of the boll weevil
had already injured the profitability of the industry by the late 1920s, and the situation of cotton
growers was further worsened by the depression. The black population seems to have been
particularly hard hit by the depression. Of the 944 county families on relief in 1933, 442, almost
half, were black, though blacks constituted only 16% of the population. Various federal relief
programs benefited farmers with farm loans and subsidies, and in 1936 a total of $204,000 in
subsidy checks was issued. The Depression encouraged diversification among farmers and a
shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of acres used
for cotton-growing fell by almost half, and cotton production went from 68,266 bales to 36,890.
Cropland acreage used for corn production increased over the same period by about half, and
wool and mohair production more than doubled to 342,983 pounds and 102,517 pounds,
respectively. While cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Williamson County,
farmers increasingly turned to other crops like sorghum and wheat and to livestock-raising in the
later 20th century. Along with such traditional livestock as sheep and cattle, poultry farming
played a significant role in the economy by 1950, when the county was fifth in the state in the
production of eggs and chickens. In 1980, it was 10th in the state in the production of turkeys.

on the 112-Acre Brushy Creek Business Park Tract, Williamson County, Texas

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The archeological survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record cultural resources occurring within and adjacent to the
jurisdictional waterways that constitute the APE
2. To provide a preliminary assessment of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
on the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the
National Park Service’s (NPS’s) online National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the General Land Office (GLO), and the Texas
State Historical Association’s and the General Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin’s
Handbook of Texas Online, as well as a program of intensive pedestrian survey of the APE. As
no cultural resources were documented within the APE during the survey, the second and third
goals were not brought into play. The rest of this chapter presents the methodological
background for the current investigations and the specific survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to conducting the archeological fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing
archival documentation to acquire information on (1) previous cultural resource investigations
conducted in the vicinity of the APE, and (2) any previously documented cultural resource
properties in or near the survey corridor. Existing site files indicated that at least 14 previously
recorded cultural resource sites exist within a 1.6-km (1.0-mi) radius of the project area. These
include 4 aboriginal lithic artifact scatters (41WM462, 41WM820, 41WM954, and 41WM1027),
3 aboriginal campsites (41WM463, 41WM927, and 41WM1026), 2 aboriginal campsites with
burned rock middens (41WM139 and 41WM140), 1 multiple-component site consisting of a
historic-age homestead or farmstead and an aboriginal lithic artifact scatter (41WM953),
1 historic-age homestead or farmstead (41WM1017), and 3 sites for which no information is on

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

file (41WM614, 41WM943, and 41WM1010). None of the previously recorded cultural resource
sites are located within or in the immediate vicinity of the APE. The nearest previously recorded
sites, 41WM139 and 41WM927, are located on the south side of Brushy Creek well beyond the
boundaries of the current project area. Similarly, no historic properties listed on the NRHP or
designated as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) occur within or in the vicinity of the APE.
Several previous cultural resource surveys have been conducted in the general vicinity of the
current project area, but none of these previous surveys covers any portion of the APE.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) Hutto, Texas, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
depicts a cemetery, designated as the McNeil Cemetery, about 91 m (300 ft) southeast of the
crossing of SH 79 over McNutt Creek. This cemetery is located on the 45-ha (112-ac) Brushy
Creek Business Park tract approximately 40 m (131 ft) east of the boundary of the portion of the
APE associated with McNutt Creek. As such, this cemetery is not within the APE of the
proposed undertaking. According to the THC’s online Texas Historic Sites Atlas, the McNeil
Cemetery has an endangerment level of “medium” and is located on private land, though little
historical information about the cemetery is present in the THC’s online files.

4.2

SURVEY METHODS

The scope of work for cultural resource investigations for the proposed development of
the Brushy Creek Business Park tract called for conducting an intensive cultural resource
survey of jurisdictional areas adjacent to 3 streams that traverse the property that were subject
to permitting under Section 404 of the CWA. Identified “waters of the US” on the tract consist of
3 stream segments, including an approximately 396-m (1,300-ft) segment of McNutt Creek, a
457-m (1,500-ft) segment of an unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek, and a 229-m (750-ft)
intermittent drainage or slough that drains a small portion of the terraces north of Brushy Creek
into McNutt Creek. The APE of the proposed undertaking therefore consists of a linear total of
1,082 m (3,550 ft) of jurisdictional waterways plus a 30-m (100-ft) buffer zone on each side of
the defined beds and banks of each stream. The jurisdictional areas surrounding the 3 stream
channels—including 2.8 ha (6.9 ac) of McNutt Creek (396 m [1,300 ft] long by 70 m [230 ft]
wide), 3.0 ha (7.4 ac) of the unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek (457 m [1,500 ft] long by 66 m
[215 ft] wide), and 1.5 ha (3.6 ac) of the unnamed tributary of McNutt Creek (229 m [750 ft] long
by 63 m [208 ft] wide)—cover a total area of 7.3 ha (17.9 ac).
On 27 December 2006, Horizon archeologists Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema,
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive
survey of the APE to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed construction project. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the APE and
thoroughly examined the modern ground surface for historic and prehistoric artifacts, cultural
features, or other evidence of past cultural activity. At the time of the survey, the sky was clear
and the weather amicable. Non-streambed portions of the APE were covered in mixed grasses
and isolated stands of deciduous hardwood trees; however, relatively little topsoil was present in
the project area, and the underlying chalky and marly bedrock was exposed in many areas
(Figures 2 to 4). Ground surface visibility ranged from 100% in areas where soils had been

completely washed away via stream action, exposing the bedrock on the modern ground
surface, to near 0% where native grasses covered the ground surface.
For block-area survey projects, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) call for excavation of 1 shovel test per 2 ac for project areas measuring
from 11 to 100 ac in size. In practice, shovel testing densities may be increased in areas with
higher probabilities to contain cultural resources, such as stream terraces, and decreased in
areas with low probabilities for cultural resources, such as heavily disturbed areas or upland
settings with minimal soil cover. Additional shovel tests may be necessary to delineate the
boundaries of any cultural resources sites. For the current project, the TSMASS would require
a minimum of about 9 shovel tests in the 7.3-ha (17.9-ac) APE. Horizon exceeded the minimum
survey standards and excavated a total of 41 shovel tests during the survey, including 16 shovel
tests along the McNutt Creek segment and 25 shovel tests along the unnamed tributary of
Brushy Creek segment (Figure 5). Three of the 25 shovel tests excavated along the Brushy
Creek tributary segment were actually excavated slightly west of the boundary of the APE to
examine some natural topographic rises. No shovel tests were excavated along the unnamed
tributary of McNutt Creek segment of the APE due to the erosional context of this area and the
ubiquity of exposed bedrock on the modern ground surface. Shovel tests measured 30 cm in
diameter and were excavated to a target depth of 1.0 m (3.3 ft) below surface, to the top of preHolocene deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable. In practice, shovel tests were
terminated prematurely due to the presence of near-surface deposits of solid sheets of

limestone bedrock and fractured, indurated bedrock at depths of 5 to 40 cm below surface
(cmbs). All sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth and
subsequently replaced in the shovel test hole from which they were excavated. None of the
shovel tests contained any subsurface cultural resources, so no archeological site delineation
shovel tests were excavated.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3.3 ft] below surface). Fractured, indurated
limestone bedrock was present at or near the modern ground surface across the entire project
area, and shovel testing revealed that extant Holocene sediments measured only 5 to 40 cm in
depth overlying native bedrock. As no deep alluvial sediment packages are present within the
APE with the potential to contain archeological resources at depth, shovel testing constituted an
adequate and effective survey technique for identifying any cultural resources buried in
Holocene-age sediments, and backhoe trenching was not conducted during the survey.
This survey set out to employ a non-collection policy for cultural materials. Nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were to be
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. In the event that any diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points,
ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) were identified in the field, they were to be
collected and placed in resealable plastic bags labeled with relevant provenience information.
No cultural resources were encountered during the survey, so the proposed collection policy
was not brought into play.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

BCRI proposes to develop the Brushy Creek Business Park tract, an approximately 45ha (112-ac) tract just west of Hutto, Williamson County, Texas, into a commercial business park.
The tract is situated on the south side of SH 79 and the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks. The
eastern and southern boundaries of the property are loosely framed by CR 123, and Brushy
Creek flows along the southern boundary. A previous jurisdictional determination confirmed the
presence of “waters of the US” on the tract. These “waters of the US” would be adversely
impacted by the proposed development of the property and are subject to permitting under
Section 404 of the CWA; as such, they fall under the jurisdiction of the USACE. While the 45-ha
(112-ac) Brushy Creek Business Park tract is currently privately owned, those portions of the
overall development defined as “waters of the US” have been determined to fall under federal
jurisdiction. The proposed development in the vicinity of the jurisdictional waterways therefore
represents a publicly sponsored undertaking, and BCRI was required to evaluate the potential of
the proposed project to adversely affect significant cultural resources within or adjacent to the
jurisdictional waterways on the property pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as
amended.
The 45-ha (112-ac) Brushy Creek Business Park tract is privately owned, and no federal
or state lands or funding are being utilized in support of the proposed development. The APE
therefore consists only of those areas within the overall development defined as “waters of the
US” that are subject to permitting by the USACE under Section 404 of the CWA (see Figure 1).
Identified “waters of the US” on the tract consist of 3 stream segments, including an
approximately 396-m (1,300-ft) segment of McNutt Creek, a 457-m (1,500-ft) segment of an
unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek, and a 229-m (750-ft) intermittent drainage or slough that
drains a small portion of the terrace north of Brushy Creek into McNutt Creek. The APE
therefore consists of a linear total of 1,082 m (3,550 ft) of jurisdictional waterways plus a 30-m
(100-ft) buffer zone on each side of the defined beds and banks of each stream. McNutt Creek
exhibits an approximately 9-m- (30-ft-) wide high-water mark, the unnamed tributary of Brushy
Creek has a jurisdictional width of approximately 5 m (15 ft), and the unnamed tributary of
McNutt Creek has a jurisdictional width of approximately 2 m (8 ft). Thus, the jurisdictional
areas surrounding the 3 stream channels—including 2.8 ha (6.9 ac) of McNutt Creek (396 m
[1,300 ft] long by 70 m [230 ft] wide), 3.0 ha (7.4 ac) of the unnamed unnamed tributary of
McNutt Creek (229 m [750 ft] long by 63 m [208 ft] wide)—cover a total area of 7.3 ha (17.9 ac).

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

On 27 December 2006, Horizon archeologists Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema,
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive
survey of the APE to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed construction project. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the APE and
thoroughly examined the modern ground surface for historic and prehistoric artifacts, cultural
features, or other evidence of past cultural activity. Horizon excavated a total of 41 shovel tests
during the survey, including 16 shovel tests along the McNutt Creek segment and 25 shovel
tests along the unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek tributary segment (see Figure 5). Three of
the 25 shovel tests excavated along the Brushy Creek tributary segment were actually
excavated slightly west of the boundary of the APE to examine some natural topographic rises.
No shovel tests were excavated along the unnamed tributary of the McNutt Creek segment of
the APE due to the erosional context of this area and the ubiquity of exposed bedrock on the
modern ground surface.
At the time of the survey, the sky was clear and the weather amicable. Non-streambed
portions of the APE were covered in mixed grasses and isolated stands of deciduous hardwood
trees; however, relatively little topsoil was present in the project area, and the underlying chalky
and marly bedrock was exposed in many areas (see Figures 2 to 4). Ground surface visibility
ranged from 100% in areas where soils had been completely washed away via stream action,
exposing the bedrock on the modern ground surface, to near 0% where native grasses covered
the ground surface. Shovel testing revealed thin, highly eroded, surficial deposits of Holocene
sediments overlying limestone bedrock and fractured, indurated bedrock at depths of 5 to
40 cmbs. Surface sediments consisted of moist black clay or loamy clay to moist, dark brown
silty clay. Limestone gravels deriving from the fractured bedrock substrate in the area were
abundant in the thin soil lenses overlying the bedrock.
No cultural resources of any kind, including prehistoric or historic archeological sites,
isolated occurrences of artifacts, or historic structures or objects, were identified as a result of
the intensive archeological survey of the APE. In addition, no previously documented
archeological sites are present in the immediate vicinity of the APE that would be impacted by
the proposed undertaking.
It should be noted, however, that the USGS Hutto, Texas, 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle depicts a cemetery, designated as the McNeil Cemetery in THC files, about 91 m
(300 ft) southeast of the crossing of SH 79 over McNutt Creek. This cemetery is located on the
45-ha (112-ac) Brushy Creek Business Park tract approximately 40 m (131 ft) east of the
boundary of the portion of the APE associated with McNutt Creek. As such, this cemetery is not
within the APE of the proposed undertaking. According to the THC’s online Texas Historic Sites
Atlas, the McNeil Cemetery has an endangerment level of “medium” and is located on private
land, though little historical information about the cemetery is present in the THC’s online files.
During the field survey, Horizon’s archeologists visited this cemetery to verify its location
and to ensure that cemetery boundaries do not extend into the APE. The cemetery is situated
in a small copse of oak trees and brush surrounded by a fence constructed of wooden T-posts
and barbed wire, and the cemetery boundaries marked on the USGS map are consistent with
the extent of metal fencing that surrounds the cemetery (Figure 6). While this cemetery is

Figure 6. Overview of Location of McNutt-Allen Cemetery in Copse of Trees and Brush
denoted as the “McNeil Cemetery” on the USGS map, a small, hand-made sign hanging from
the fence near the cemetery gate identifies this as the “McNutt-Allen Cemetery” (Figure 7). The
cemetery is small, measuring only about 23 m (75 ft) square, and it contains 8 to 10 graves
marked by headstones. No headstones were observed outside the cemetery fencelines, but the
potential for unmarked burials was not assessed. Vandalism has been extensive—some of the
lids on aboveground stone crypts have been partially smashed and the fence has either been
torn down or fallen down and repaired in several places. The graves are distributed around a
large oak tree in the approximate center of the cemetery. Dates of death on legible headstones
range from 1853 to 1895 and include members of the McNutt, Allen, McElroy, and Harris
families.
The most prominent grave in the cemetery is that of Major Robert McNutt (Figure 8), an
important personage in the history of Texas (Handbook 2007). Born on 1 May 1795, in what
would become Tennessee, McNutt fought in the War of 1812 as a private, eventually marrying
and moving to Texas in 1834. In March 1836, McNutt assumed the rank of captain and helped
form a company of Austin County volunteers to relieve the Alamo. McNutt later served in the
Battle of San Jacinto, having recently become a major. He was relieved from military service in
1836 and given 2 land grants in Bastrop and Lee counties for his service. McNutt and his family
settled near Georgetown in 1851, where he lived until his death on 31 August 1853.

The McNutt-Allen cemetery is the final resting place of both McNutt and his wife (née
Mary Jackson), who is buried next to him. McNutt’s grave is marked by a large, aboveground
stone crypt with a partially damaged lid and a large historical plaque, erected in 1963, standing
at 1 end of the crypt. The historical plaque commemorates McNutt’s military service at the
battle of San Jacinto, though this cemetery is not listed as a Texas Historic Cemetery.
While the McNeill-Allen cemetery is not located within the APE defined by Section 404
jurisdictional areas, BRCI has indicated that it plans not to disturb the McNeill-Allen cemetery
during development of the Brushy Creek Business Park property.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination
of whether or not an archeological site possesses the potential to make a contribution to 1 or
more previously defined research questions. Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey
level are rarely sufficient to contribute in a meaningful manner to such research issues. The
objective is rather to determine which archeological sites could be most profitably investigated
further in pursuance of regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore,
adequate information on site function, context, and chronological placement from archeological
and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because
research questions vary as a function of geography and temporal period, determination of the
site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important
objective during the inventory process.
Ultimately, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a function of
the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Archeological
resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of
archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for determination as SALs.

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

6.3

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

No archeological resources, historic or prehistoric, were documented within the APE as
a result of the intensive cultural resource survey of the Brushy Creek Business Park tract. No
28

cultural resources were encountered on the modern ground surface or in any of the shovel tests
excavated during the survey. While several archeological sites have been recorded in the
general vicinity of the project area, the closest sites are on the opposite side of Brushy Creek,
well beyond the boundaries of the APE. Furthermore, no NRHP-listed historic properties or
SALs are located in the vicinity of the project area.

6.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the intensive cultural resource survey of the proposed APE, no
potentially significant archeological resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking.
No new cultural resource sites were identified in the APE as a result of the survey, and no
previously recorded sites are present in APE.
One historic-age cemetery, designated as the “McNeil Cemetery” in THC files and as the
“McNeill-Allen Cemetery” on a small sign hanging from the fence next to the cemetery gate, is
present on the proposed 45-ha (112-ac) Brushy Creek Business Park tract about 91 m (300 ft)
southeast of the crossing of SH 79 over McNutt Creek. While this cemetery is located on the
privately owned Brushy Creek Business Park tract, it is situated approximately 40 m (131 ft)
east of the boundary of the portion of the APE associated with McNutt Creek. As such, this
cemetery is not within the APE of the proposed undertaking. Examination of legible headstones
indicates that inhumations extending from 1853 to 1895 are present within the cemetery. One
of the graves in the cemetery is that of Major Robert McNutt, a historically important personage
in the history of Texas. While a historic plaque has been erected at the head of McNutt’s grave
commemorating his service in the Battle of San Jacinto, this cemetery is not listed as a Texas
Historic Cemetery. While the McNeill-Allen cemetery is not located within the APE defined by
Section 404 jurisdictional areas, BRCI has indicated that it plans not to disturb the McNeill-Allen
cemetery during development of the Brushy Creek Business Park property.
No cultural resources of any kind, including prehistoric or historic archeological sites,
isolated occurrences of artifacts, or historic structures or objects, were identified as a result of
the intensive archeological survey of the APE. No further cultural resource investigations are
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, in the event that human
skeletal remains, direct or indirect signs of human burial, or burial furniture are inadvertently
discovered during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of project-related facilities within
the APE, all work in the vicinity of the discovery should cease immediately and the USACE and
THC should be notified.
