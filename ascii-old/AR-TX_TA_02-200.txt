Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a background review of the Faith
Sandy Trunkline, Extension, and well connects. TAAI then conducted a full pedestrian field
survey along the proposed rights-of-way. The project was entirely privately funded, and the
properties across which the pipeline will cross are privately owned; therefore, no Texas
Antiquities Permit was required.
The field survey was conducted by two archaeologists on December 6, 2012. During the course
of the survey, the only evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural materials observed along
the main right-of-way and well connects was on previously recorded site 41DM177. Following
an intensive survey of the site area, Tierras Antiguas’ assessment was that the pipeline’s
construction would not adversely impact potentially significant cultural materials on the site.
However, Tierras Antiguas futher recommended if any previously undocumented cultural
materials are discovered during pipeline construction, that construction be halted until these
materials can be evaluated by Tierras Antiguas or by any other qualified archaeologists.
A single projectile point was collected during this survey, and will be returned to the landowner.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly four individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Ms. Judy Vader,
and Mr. Ryan DeBarros, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, and Mr.
Ronnie Glenewinkel and Mr. David Black, Environmental Coordinator and Permitting Specialist
at Mockingbird Midstream. All were extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and
their overall knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our understanding of the
project’s scope of work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologist Belisario Silva,
who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured this survey
was conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Modern Environmental Setting
Climate and Vegetation
Dimmit and Maverick counties are located in south-central Texas along its southern border with
Mexico (see Figure 1). Their current political boundaries encompass just under 3,000 square
miles. The generally flat to rolling terrain ranges in elevation from about 500-960 feet above
mean sea level. Clayey and loamy soils support the growth of small predominately mesquite
trees, with few live oaks, and thorny scrub brush with assorted cacti and grassy understory.
With their semi-arid environment, the counties are generally frost-free from mid-February
through early December, allowing for an approximate 290-day growing season. The average
annual rainfall is about 20-22 inches, with most rainfall occurring in May and September. These
peaks are the result of thunderstorms bearing moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and
the Pacific Ocean much farther to the west. Dimmit County is known as part of the Winter
3

Garden Region for the vegetables
grown there (Leffler 1996; Ochoa
1996; Vierra 1998; Stevens and Arriaga
1985).
However, rainfall amounts vary
significantly from year to year, and the
high evapotranspiration effects in the
area effectively offset any beneficial
surplus of annual rainfall. This is a
reason irrigation systems are so
necessary, and commonly found in use
today throughout the area. Summers are
indeed hot and dry, with temperatures
consistently hovering above 1000F,
humidity is generally low compared to
environments closer to the Gulf Coast.
Overall, the climate can be classified as
subtropical steppe.
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande
are the major southeasterly trending
rivers draining the South Texas region.
A subtle divide through the county
causes numerous intermittent creeks to
flow south into the Nueces River, and
others to drain toward the north, and
into the Frio River. Many drainages
intermittently flow into both rivers
during infrequent seasonal periods of
abundant rainfall. Although there are
many springs in the area, very few are
active due primarily to the dip of the
substrate shales which carry these
subterranean seeps to the south and
east. Ancient springs that may have
existed in the area at one time have
likely succumbed to overgrazing and
irrigation pumping during modern
times (Brune 1981).

Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South Figure 7. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.
4

Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation area as defined by Gould (1975), and the regional flora
of South Texas has been classified as being part of the Tamaulipan biotic province extending out
from northeast Mexico (Figures 6 and 7). This is the only part of Texas where some vegetation
exhibits growth throughout the year (Blair 1950; Maps 2012a). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent occurrence, with a mix of woody and grassland
species providing a savanna environment during prehistoric times (Archer 1995; Black 1989;
Hester 1980; Inglis 1964). The original vegetation was an open grassland mixed with brushy
chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and ash were common along perennial streams. Due in part to
overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the invasion of woody species has changed the vegetation
into “Texas brush country” dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny hackberry, brazil, whitebrush,
lotebrush, and others (Diamond et al. 1987:203-221). On sandy soils, the brush includes
mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast, clay soils support mesquite (Proposis juliflora),
various species of Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), lignum
vitae (Porliera angustifolia), cenizo (Leucophyllum texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana),
prickly pear (Opuntia lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), and species of Condalia and
Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits some of the greatest mammalian species
diversity in the state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several species
of turtles, salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50
species of fish have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years
ago. Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago
was much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the
present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants
5

Cultural Chronology
The Project Area project lies within the South Texas archaeological region as defined by Hester
(1980, 1995, 2004). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due to the
compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated
within the region. Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of information that exists for
south Texas and as such offers only a “general framework” for prehistoric periods particular to
the region (Figure 8). All dates are given as approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before
1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of
Clovis-type points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no
camp sites or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herd
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
6

change by the Prehistoric
inhabitants of south Texas
(McKinney 1981). While the
basic hunter-gatherer adaptation
probably remained intact, an
economic shift away from big
game hunting was necessary. In
general, more intensive
exploitation of local and
smaller resources such as deer,
fish, and plant bulbs is
indicated by greater densities of
ground-stone artifacts, firecracked rock cooking features,
and more specialized tools.
Weir (1976) speculates that
Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an
inference based on the fact that
Early Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic
projectile point types are seen
across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Story (1985) believes
that population densities were
low during the Early Archaic,
and that groups consisted of
related individuals in small
bands with “few constraints on
their mobility” (Story 1985:39).
Their economy was based on
the utilization of a wide range
of resources, especially such
year-round resources as prickly
pear and lechugilla, as well as
rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350
B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441)
suggests that the period
between 4450 and 2350 B.P.
reflects the Middle Archaic in

south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on
the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the South
Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce,
at least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay
1974). Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward
less mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner et al. (2011) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period
during the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is
represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap
the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this
marked a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and
bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw
1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not
disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
8

between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a
nonstandard manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the
ones that best suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core
reduction and the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology
is a continent-wide phenomenon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah
assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468). Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas
has not been documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a
significant presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
9

Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans
were rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

Dimmit County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in Dimmit County indicate that the area has been occupied for about
11,000 years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land
hospitable. Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed
rabbitskin robes, and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly
increased the deadliness of their spears (Hester 1984; Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300
years ago, they learned to make pottery and to hunt with bows and arrows. “During the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Coahuiltecan Indians native to Dimmit County were
squeezed out by other Indian who were migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were
moving up from the south. Many of the Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in
Coahuila. Apaches and Comanches moved in to take their place” (Leffler 1996).
“No permanent Spanish settlement seems to have been established in the future Dimmit County.
10

Beginning in the late 1600s, however, Spaniards passed through the area on the Old San Antonio
Road, a camino real, to and from other Spanish settlements in Texas. After the Mexican War of
Independence the Mexican government used land grants to encourage its citizens to settle in
Texas. Perhaps as many as seven grants were made between 1832 and 1834 that included
territory now in Dimmit County. None of the recipients seems to have made use of the land,
however. By 1836, when Texas became independent from Mexico, the area remained populated
almost solely by Indians” (Leffler 1996).
Between the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War (1836–46), most of Dimmit County lay in
the disputed area between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River, and it became a haven for
desperate characters until about 1865. Carrizo Springs was founded in 1865, with the new
settlers who lived in jacals or dugouts frequently being harrassed by hostile Indians and outlaws.
Due in part tobeing pursued by the Texas Rangers, and being decimated by disease, the Indians
were forced to leave Dimmit County by 1877, and in 1880 Carrizo Springs became the county
seat for the newly formed county. By 1880, cattle ranching was firmly established, and although
sheep ranching was also an important part of the economy at the time, by 1900 extended
droughts and an increase in predators combined to make sheep ranching a tough and dwindling
business (Leffler 1996).
Although the residents of Dimmit County learned to cope with the sparse annual rainfall, artesian
wells ushered in an era of large vegetable truck farms in the 1890s, and Dimmit County became
known as part of the Texas Winter Garden Region, one of the most prolific vegetable-growing
areas in the country.
As with rest of the nation, during the Great Depression many of the county’s farmers were forced
to cut back their once-lucrative vegetable production during the depression, and fell back on
raising poultry, hogs, and dairy cattle (Leffler 1996). The discovery of large oil and gas fields in
the county in the 1950s certainly bolstered Dimmit County’s economy, and although large
ranches lay claim to most of the land in the county, the production of oil and gas are very much
a progressively increasing part of the county’s development (Leffler 1996).

Maverick County Prehistory and History
As with Dimmit County, diagnostic stone tools and pottery sherds found in Maverick County
suggest that it too was occupied by hunters and gatherers from the Paleoindian Period through
the Historic Period. Just as today these inhabitants were attracted to the many springs, and by
abundance of wild game and plant resources along the riverine environments. The area was
inhabited by hunters and gatherers county was periodically inhabited by bands of Coahuiltecan
Indians and in earlier times by hunter gatherers, whose discarded metates, manos, and projectile
points have been uncovered at former watering holes and springs throughout the county.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
([now modern-day Guerrero] [Weddle 1991]). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled
11

the Camino Real in southern Maverick County enroute to newly established missions and
settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the 1700s and 1800s. The Canary Islanders who
were brought in to settle early San Antonio came through Maverick County in 1730. Ranching
activity in the area began as early as 1765. The county’s namesake, Samuel A. Maverick
ventured through the county in the early 1800s. Although a generally desolate area inhabited by
roaming bands of Native Americans, a Dr. John Charles Beales established roots in the area in
1834.
With the advent of the Mexican War with the United States in 1846, Camp Eagle Pass, and later
named Fort Duncan was established in 1849. In 1850, the community of Eagle Pass was platted,
and Piedras Negras across the Rio Grande was founded. Mexican families from across the river
expanded into Texas, and these families trace their roots to the early development of Eagle Pass.
The first post office in Eagle Pass was established in 1851. In the ensuing years, lawlessness
prevailed, with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.
In 1856, Maverick County was established from territory broken off from Kinney County. Prior
to the Civil War, the citizens of Maverick County voted 80 to 3 to stay loyal to the Union.
Nevertheless, Confederate soldiers occupied Fort Duncan during the war. An extension of
civilization reached Eagle Pass when telegraph lines reached Fort Duncan from Fort Clark in
1875, and a new courthouse was completed ten years later in 1885.
Still very rural by 1900, the average size of farms in the county was over 37,000 acres, raising
sheep and cattle. Shortly thereafter, the Rio Grande was tapped to provide much needed
irrigation water for large crops of onions, figs, alfalfa, and cotton. In latter half of the 20th
century, the oil and natural gas, mining, and ranching fueled Maverick County’s economy
(Ochoa 1996).

Site Types to be Expected Along the Project Area
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Dimmit County and Maverick counties are
prehistoric open campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic
period (see Figure 8). Some of these represent a single campfire where a very small group of
Native Americans may have camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive
areas representing large groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with
ancestral groups returning to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years.
Cultural remains to be found at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance
of fire-cracked rocks representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the
lithic debris that results from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and
seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds,
and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be
in a plush riverine environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal
12

foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses,
shrubs, cacti offered a different food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds,
mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various times,
bison were known to graze on the northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for
use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients
that can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a
well-preserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most
frequently occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in
upland settings where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients
that archaeologists look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic
preservation in the form of charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation,
temporally diagnostic stone tools or ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along
the Project Area. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that
were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The
general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open
campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time
( However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make
them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural
outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite
cobbles. Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with
one or two flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from
experience the quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool
production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was
judged to be inferior, then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles
found on these sites are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool
products are carried away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the
manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular
debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’.
These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’
that can be used to further reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of
it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been
carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The
snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
13

of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in the Dimmit County area have been
documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarry Sites
Prehistoric quarries and procurement also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic
periods, but differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose
gravels, but at times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or
quartzites were not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’.
These types of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally
do not present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to
pick up gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped
stone remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or
quartzites, as well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also
be expected. Although a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded
in south Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no documented burned rock middens in Dimmit County, and only two have been
recorded in Maverick County. Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth
ovens that were constructed much like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for
roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the
earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’
around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is dug near by, and the
procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks
coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the formation of
burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001;
Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in
south Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites
in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric
cemetery found in close proximity to the Project Area is 41LK28, in Live Oak County.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of
permanent structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the area was generally
not considered safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers
then began establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler and Long 1996; Leffler 1996).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
14

ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site
types most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and
foundation remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional
family burial or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related
structures or construction projects.

Archaeological Atlas and Historic Maps Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within each of the four counties, the results simply provide the data that is
available. In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed
based upon the types of cultural resource surveys, and the areas of those surveys. That said, the
data that is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the areas of south Texas that the
surveys represent. Most of south Texas has never been subjected to formal cultural resource
surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is very poorly
understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least some
aspect of what the region looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Dimmit County
Other than early work done by A. T. Jackson in 1932, perhaps the earliest systematic
archaeological survey in Dimmit County was conducted by Parker Nunley and Tom Hester.
Their work resulted in the documentation of 24 archaeological sites in the county, ranging in age
from the Early Archaic through the Late Prehistoric Toyah phase (Nunley and Hester 1966).
However, other surveys in the county since that time have resulted in a total of 155
archaeological sites being documented in the county. Evidence of ancient hearths, along with
diagnostic projectile points indicate that 100 of these sites had been used as open campsites from
as early as the Paleoindian period, and through as late as the Late Prehistoric periods (see Figure
8). Of particular note was the discovery of prehistoric human burials at four of these sites.
Prehistoric lithic scatters and lithic procurement sites account for 50 of those documented, where
pieces of chipped stone represent the technology used to fashion stone tools through time. Three
sites were emphasized for their abundance of lithic raw material, and where Native Americans
exploited gravel outcrops for making stone tools. Other sites of interest include a carved Indian
petroglyph, and other petroglyphs near Campo de los Cuervos. Historic sites documented within
the county include farmsteads with the remains of houses, corrals, cisterns, and trash scatters.
At one of those sites is a circle of stone marking a cowboy burial. The remnants of an old
railroad bed that runs through the county has also been designated as an archaeological site. The
only State Archeological Landmark is the county courthouse in Carrizo Springs (Atlas 2013).
Maverick County
Before about 1960, there was only a limited effort to record archaeological sites in Maverick
County. However, due in part to of an infusion of federal and state dollars into Maverick County
over the past 30-40 years, mandated cultural resource survey investigations have been enhanced,
15

resulting in the documentation of several previously undocumented archaeological sites. A few
of the early local historians who attempted to document sites in the 1960s were Ben Pingenot,
John Woodhull, and Charles Downing.
The first major archaeological survey in the county was conducted south of Eagle Pass in 1975
by J. P. Nunley. In that effort he recorded 42 sites as part of the Guerrero Gateway Project
(Hunziker 1998). Another large survey conducted on the Dos Republicas Coal Mine property
northeast of Eagle Pass resulted in the documentation of another 42 sites (Uecker 1994; Uecker
and Warren 1994). In her study of 190 archaeological sites recorded in Maverick County,
Johanna Hunziker (1998) found that although projectile points ranging in antiquity from the
Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric have been recovered, the most commonly found point
types could be associated with the Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.). The most common Late
Archaic point types included Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Matamoras, Edgewood, and Figuerora. Of
those sites with diagnostics, approximately half were single component, and half were multicomponent.
In a sample of 94 components where elevation was known, Late Archaic components comprised
36% of the total, 23% Middle Archaic, 19% Early Archaic, and 19% Late Prehistoric. Middle
Archaic sites tended to be located at higher elevations, Late Archaic at lower elevations, and Late
Prehistoric components even lower, along creeks. Based upon these same 94 components, and
extrapolating for differences in temporal periods, Hunziker demonstrates that the sites were few
in number through the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods, increased somewhat during the
Middle Archaic, more than doubled in the Late Archaic, and then remained relatively constant
through the Late Prehistoric period. Only on 12 of the 94 component sites were burned rock
middens or burned rock concentrations observed; 17 had ground stone fragment, 42 contained
freshwater mussel shells, and human burials were found on four sites.
A review of the Texas Atlas indicates that as of February 28, 2013 there were 294 archaeological
sites documented in Maverick County. Over 56 percent (165) of those were described as
prehistoric open campsites, while just over 40 percent (116) were either prehistoric lithic scatters
or procurement sites. There are two documented burned rock middens in Maverick County.
Historic sites include 1800s and 1900s house sites and farmsteads, ranch headquarters, ranchhand one-room houses, cisterns, a lone burial, and trash scatters. Other interesting sites include
adobe structures of an unknown age, mine shafts and associated structures, graffiti carved in
stone by soldiers in 1919, an irrigation pumphouse and acequia, and a section of the Maverick
Canal. The two State Archaeological Landmark sites in the county are Fort Duncan and the
Maverick County Courthouse.
Nearby Archaeological Sites
A recent review of the Texas Atlas of Archeological Sites indicated that there had been two
known archaeological sites recorded within approximately one mile of the proposed Project Area
(see Figures 3 and 4). They are 41DM38 and 41DM177, discussed below:

16

41DM38
This prehistoric open campsite was documented by Nunley Parker and Thomas Hester in the
mid-1960s (Nunley and Hester 1966:247), and is described as follows:
“41DM38. Also on the Faith ranch in southwest Dimmit County, this site overlooks San Lorenzo
Creek southeast of the ranch headquarters. Both Neo-Aerican and Archaic artifacts were found.
The artifacts at 41DM38 included six dart points of the following types and categories: two
Catan-Abasolo, one crude Refugio-like, one Matamoras, one Palmillas-like, and one large
straight-stemmed dart point. One arrow point of the Perdiz type was also recovered. Other lithic
material picked up included: nine knives and knife fragments, two scraper fragments, two heavy
core tools, and two miscellaneous lithic items”.
41DM177
This prehistoric open campsite was documented in January 2012 by John Griggs of CRC, LLC
during an archaeological survey prior to construction of a concrete low water crossing and oil
lease road across Ambrosia Creek. He described it as an “extensive surficial lithic scatter of
flaked stone tools, debitage, ground stone and fire-cracked rock on terrace on west bank of
Ambrosia Creek (Atlas 2013). Surface collections included a Clear Fork uniface fragment, an
unidentified dart point tip, and two biface fragments. Other artifacts observed included an
unidentified dart point tip, bifaces, unifaces, cores, tested cobbles, flakes, a sandstone discoidal
abrader, an apparent grinding slab fragment, and fire-cracked rocks. He tested the site with a
mechanical auger, surmised that the site had been heavily collected for diagnostics, assessed the
research potential as low to moderate, and recommended no further investigations.
Historic Maps
A standard source of historic research is the extensive collection of online maps and aerial
photographs available at the Perry Castañeda Library at the University of Texas at Austin (Perry
Castañeda Library 2012). In general, the area has apparently been historically used as ranchland
pasture, with no development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock
tanks, corrals, and sparsely scattered outbuildings. As such, no historic aerial photographs were
found in this usual reliable online database.
The oldest topographic maps found of the area was a 1940 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(1:62,500) topographic maps of the Chupadera area (Maps 2012b), which shows no structures
on or adjacent to the proposed Faith Sandy Trunkline. This map is not exact by today’s
standards, and it is possible that historic water tanks, corrals, outbuildings and other structures
related to early ranching activities could be encountered along the Project Area rights-of-way and
well connects that do not appear on any old maps. Technically, any structures older than 45 years
are now considered of interest by the Texas Historical Commission, and this should be
considered when the trunkline and well connects are excavated.

However, in reality, without an on-the-ground physical examination and potential shovel testing

Background Review Summary
From this preliminary cultural resources background review, it was clear that the proposed
Project Area rights-of-way with well connects could encounter previously undocumented
archaeological sites. Some of those may be heavily disturbed and/or redundant site types, and
as such have little to contribute to the prehistory of south Texas. These sites should be considered
as non-significant, and should not impede the pipeline’s construction as planned. However, it
was also clear from this review that there was a moderate probability that archaeological sites
of significance lie in the planned main rights-of-way and well connects. In addition, as discussed
above, the main rights-of-way was to impact previously recorded archaeological site 41DM177.
The main rights-of-way and well connects had never been subjected to a cultural resources
survey, and therefore the number of undocumented sites, as well as their potential significance
along the rights-of-way were unknowns. Although the number of sites and their potential
significance can be modeled, because of the scant few professional surveys that have been
conducted in this area of south Texas to date (and under less stringent standards than mandated
today), such models are considered unreliable. Accordingly, TAAI recommended that a full

20

pedestrian cultural resources survey along the Project Area rights-of-way be conducted, with
shovel testing at the discretion of the Project Archaeologist.

Field Survey Goals, Methods, and Levels of Effort
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
A 100-percent pedestrian survey of the rights-of-way was conducted, with two archaeologists
meandering back and forth across the rights-of-way to ensure full coverage. In accordance with
a general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and
historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via sketches, field
photographs, and copious notes.
Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be
considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early ArchaicPaleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-bycase basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project
Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences adjacent to the
ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in this report of investigations. All
cutbanks, and rodent and mammal backdirt piles along the rights-of-way were thoroughly
examined.
The lone archaeological site documented (41DM177) was mapped using a pace-and-compass
method, as well as a GPS. Field notes were made about the site and a sketch map was drawn.
Digital photographs of the site and selected artifacts were taken, as well as selected photographs
representing the surveyed rights-of-way in general, and a photo log was maintained.

suggest that this Figure 20. Selected artifacts at 41DM177; from left to right campsite may have been Abasolo dart point, biface fragment, bifaces.
used extensively for one
or more periods in prehistory. The occupation(s) at 41D177 appear to have been tethered to San
Ambrosia Creek that may have been flowing at least intermittently in prehistory, offering not
only fresh water and the accompanying resources, but also allowing easy access to upland game
animals and plants. Although the Abasolo dart point suggests a Middle Archaic occupation,
without the documentation of all temporal diagnostics that may have been collected from this
site over the years, other time periods of occupation(s) remain largely unknown.
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Overall, the cultural material that lies within the pipeline rights-of-way appears to be either on
the surface or shallowly buried, creating a palimpsest of any repeated occupations that may have
occurred. In addition, the Faith Sandy Trunkline is to be deeply bored underneath the site and
San Ambrosia Creek, thus avoiding any negative impact to the site. In sum, our assessment is
that construction of the Faith Sandy Trunkline and Extension be allowed to proceed as planned.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recomemndations
Upon arrival at the Project Area in December 2012, we observed that trenching and pipe
installation had already been accomplished along the eastern half of the main rights-of-way and
well connects, and the areas to be examined were heavily disturbed. Nevertheless, two
archaeologists walked this portion of the pipeline and well connects, examining the disturbed
soils and scraped backdirt piles. The western half of the main rights-of-way had not been
disturbed except for brush clearing and chipping. An exception was at San Ambrosia Creek
26

where a concrete low-water crossing had been constructed, and impacted Site 41DM177.
However, that area had been investigated by CRC International & Energy Consultants
archaeologists in January 2012, and cleared for construction (see “Nearby Archaeological Sites”
discussion above).
Although the background review suggested that there could be potentially significant prehistoric
archaeological sites along the proposed lateral and well connects, our field examination revealed
that in general, the soils are shallow and eroded, with little or no terrace deposits. Particular
attention was provided to the rights-of-way at San Ambrosia Creek and 41DM177, where terrace
deposits were extant. Otherwise, the pipeline will course through upland areas with generally
shallow and deflated soils.
During the course of the survey, the only evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural
materials observed along the main rights-of-way and well connects was on previously recorded
site 41DM177. Following an intensive survey of the site area, Tierras Antiguas’ assessment is
that the pipeline’s construction will not adversely impact any potentially significant cultural
materials on the site.
In sum, it is our opinion that (1) installation of the Faith Sandy Trunkline, Extension, and well
connects prior to our December 2012 examination did not impact any significant cultural
resources, and (2) construction of the remainder of the trunkline and well connects as planned
will not impact any significant cultural resources. However, Tierras Antiguas recommends that
should any previously undiscovered cultural materials be discovered, work should be halted until
such finds are evaluated either by TAAI, or any other qualified archaeologists.
