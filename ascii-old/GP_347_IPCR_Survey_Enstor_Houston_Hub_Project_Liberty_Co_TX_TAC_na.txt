ABSTRACT

In August 2006, HRA Gray & Pape LLC, of Houston, Texas, undertook an intensive
pedestrian cultural resources investigation for the proposed Enstor Houston Hub Storage and
Transportation Project in Liberty County, Texas. The archaeological Area of Potential Effect
consists of the development of a proposed natural gas storage facility, including salt dome
storage caverns, natural gas compression facilities, the construction of pipelines, and
development of access roads resulting in a total of approximately 388.09 hectares (958.99
acres).
Fieldwork was conducted during two different mobilizations, once in August 2006
and once in April 2007, with survey activities designed to assess the potential impact that
construction might have on cultural resources located within or near the survey area.
Background research of records housed at the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory in Austin, Texas determined that no cultural resources surveys were previously
conducted within the survey area and no previously identified archaeological sites or
architectural resources are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the survey area.
The field investigation consisted of reconnaissance and pedestrian survey and
subsurface shovel testing. Generally, shovel tests were placed in potentially undisturbed
areas; however, survey personnel also assessed portions of the survey area lying in areas
impacted by agriculture and previous pipeline placement. In total, 353 shovel tests were
excavated within the 388.09-hectare (958.99-acre) survey area.
Shovel tests ranged from between 30 centimeters and 1 meter (11.8 inches and 3.3
feet) in depth. Prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were not encountered during
subsurface testing in any of the survey segments. Test results show the entire survey area to
have been disturbed by ongoing and former agricultural practices.
HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further investigation be required in the
survey area, and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey
conducted by HRA Gray & Pape, LLC. (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, on behalf of
Enstor Houston Hub Storage and Transportation, L.P. (Enstor) for the development of a
natural gas storage facility at the North Dayton Salt Dome Storage Project (Project) in Liberty
County, Texas (Figure 1). The storage facility will include salt dome storage caverns, natural
gas compression facilities, natural gas, raw water and brine transport pipelines, electrical
infrastructure, pipeline interconnect sites, natural gas injection/withdrawal, raw water
withdrawal and deep injection well pads, and access roads, resulting in a total area for the
Project of approximately 273.57 hectares (676 acres). However, the area surveyed in the
present investigations was 388.09 hectares (958.99 acres), and this survey included the 676Â­
acre Project area. Enstor will file an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and
Necessity (CPCN) with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) pursuant to
Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), seeking authorization to construct and operate
the salt dome natural gas storage facility.
FERC is the lead agency for this project. In accordance with FERC requirements for
the certification of the proposed project, this report evaluates potential impacts on cultural
resources within the survey area, and provides recommendations, if any, for further work on
resources identified during the survey. All work associated with this investigation was
conducted pursuant to standards set forth by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
those outlined by the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36
CFR 800) for properties listed on National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All
fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to federal (NHPA)
guidelines.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization for the survey, a background literature and site file
search was conducted to identify the presence of previously known archaeological sites in or
near the archaeological Area of Potential Effect (APE). The archaeological APE for this
project consists of all property located within the 388.09-hectare (958.99-acre) survey area.
The search indicated that no previously recorded archaeological sites lie within the survey
area, and no sites are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the survey area. This
document presents the results of the intensive pedestrian cultural resource assessment,
including a background literature and site file search and physical survey of the survey area.

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The following section provides a discussion of the general geomorphological
characteristics found in the Liberty County area. This is followed by discussions of soil
characteristics, climate, and the flora and fauna typical of the area.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
Liberty County is included in two major land resource areas, namely the Gulf Coast
Prairie (making up the 58 percent of the county), and the Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods
(making up 42 percent of the county). These areas exhibit a low surface relief and with soils
dominated by clayey and silty loams developed from marine sediments of the Pliocene-aged
Houston Group (Hardin 1962). These deposits are the result of a combination of processes
involving sea level changes during Pleistocene glaciation and the formation of the
Mississippi drainage system. These sediments are exposed in an east to west band with older
material located in the north and younger material being exposed south toward the Gulf
(Hardin 1962). Broad areas of the county lie in the floodplains surrounding the San Jacinto
and Trinity Rivers. Most of the land use within these areas is used for grazing and crops
(such as rice, soybeans, hay), and for timber (pine and hardwood); so the dominant land use
categories are agricultural and silvicultural. Those areas that have not been cleared are
typically covered by water-tolerant hardwoods (Griffith 1996).
The survey area is depicted on the Dayton and Simmons Bottom 7.5-minute
quadrangle maps and is located approximately 5.49 kilometers (3.41 miles) northwest of
Dayton, Texas city center. The survey area is situated on land that predominantly has been
heavily altered by agricultural processes.

SOILS
The proposed survey area contains soils that have been mapped and described by
Griffith (1996), and updated by the National Cooperative Soil Survey Web Soil Survey
(NCSS WSS 2006) and the Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
United States Department of Agriculture (SSS NRCS USDA 2006). The survey area
contains mapped soils of the League series, Yeaton series, Beaumont series, Mocarey series,
Bernard series, and Morey series. These soils formed during the Pleistocene and most of
them are used for rice cultivation or pasture today. Descriptions of these soils from the
sources listed above are summarized below.

5
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATIONâDO NOT RELEASE

League series soils consist of nearly level, very deep, very slowly permeable soils
located on the Coastal Prairie that are somewhat poorly drained clay soils. The surface layer
is composed of gray (10YR5/1) to very dark (10YR4/1), extremely hard, very sticky clay
with strong brown (7.5YR5/6) iron concretions to a depth of 28 centimeters (11 inches).
Underlying this is a stratum of very dark gray (10YR3/1) to gray (10YR5/1) clay with light
olive brown (2.5Y5/6) iron concretions 175cm (69 inches) thick. These soils formed in
clayey sediments on uplands during the Pleistocene age. In modern farming, these soils are
often used for rice cultivation and fallow pasture.
Yeaton loam, clayey loam, and silty loam soils are made of nearly level, deep,
somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcium carbonate enriched marine sediment
during the Pleistocene age. They are found on nearly level to gently sloping Gulf Coast
Prairie. Yeaton soils also have a perched water table that periodically occurs at depths
between 30.48 to 45.72 centimeters (12 to 18 inches) during wet winter months. The surface
is about 20 centimeters (8 inches) thick and consists of dark gray (10YR4/1) loam. This is
followed by a 12-centimeter (5-inch) layer of dark grayish brown (2.5Y4/2) loam with light
olive brown (2.5Y5/6) mottles. Underlying that is a 170-centimeter (67-inch) layer, which
consists of silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam with a hue ranging of 10YR value 5 through 7
and a chroma of 2 through 8. This layer has mottles of brown, yellow, and gray, as well as
15 to 35 percent of soft calcium carbonate masses.
Beaumont series soils consist of nearly level, very deep, poorly drained soils on
uplands of the Gulf Coast Prairie. These extremely hard, extremely firm dark gray clays
formed in clayey delta sediments of the Pleistocene age. The surface layer is about 23
centimeters (9 inches) thick and made of very dark gray (10YR4/1) clay with dark yellowish
brown (10YR4/6) iron concretions. This is underlain by a 180-centimeter (71-inch) thick
layer made of gray (N 6/0) to light gray (N 7/0) strong, extremely hard, extremely firm clay
with common medium reddish yellow (7.5Y 6/6) iron concretions.
The Mocarey series loam, clay loam consists of very deep, moderately well drained
soils that formed in thick loamy calcium carbonate enriched sediments during the Pleistocene
age. These soils are found on Gulf Coast Prairies of the Beaumont Formation. A perched
water table occurs at about 45.72 centimeters (18 inches) during winter and at about 1.22
meters (4 feet) during the dry part of the summer. Flooding occurs in some areas during high
intensity rains, because runoff does not occur quickly enough. The surface layer is very dark
(10YR3/1) to dark (10YR4/1) gray loam up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) thick. That is
followed by layer of dark gray (10YR4/1), dark gray (10YR6/3), gray (10YR6/1), or light
gray (10YR7/2) hard loam or clay loam with calcium carbonate concretions up to 101
centimeters (40 inches) thick. Below that is a 20-centimeter (8-inch) thick layer of very hard,
very firm gray (10YR6/1) clay loam with many fine yellowish brown (10YR5/6) iron
concretions.
The Bernard series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed
in thick clayey sediments on marine terraces during the Pleistocene age. Bernard soils are
found on broad Gulf Coast Prairies. They are also saturated within 60 centimeters (24
6
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATIONâDO NOT RELEASE

inches) of the surface during wet winter and spring months. Bernard soils typically have four
strata. The surface layer is about 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick and consists of very dark
gray (10YR3/1) or dark gray (10YR4/1) very hard clay loam with few iron manganese
concretions. The layer below that ranges from very dark gray (10YR3/1), dark gray (N 4/0),
gray (N5/0), grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2), and light brownish gray (2.5Y6/2) very hard clay.
The third stratum is about 20 centimeters (8 inches) thick and made of brown (10YR5/3) clay
loam with brown (7.5YR5/6) and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) mottles. Sometimes another
layer of hard strong brown (7.5YR5/6) clay 30 centimeters (12 inches) thick can be found.
Morey series soils are very deep, somewhat poorly drained, silty soils on uplands that
formed in silty sediments during the Pleistocene age. It is found in the Gulf Coast Prairie
east of the Trinity River to western Louisiana. Morey series has essentially two strata. The
surface layer is very dark gray (10YR3/1) hard loam, and about 10 to 38 centimeters (4 to 15
inches) thick. Underlying this is a 15 to 200-centimeter (5 to 80-inch) thick stratum that
ranges from very dark gray (10YR3/1), dark gray (10YR4/1), grayish brown (10YR5/2), to
light brownish gray (2.5YR6/2) clay loam. This stratum will have varying iron manganese
concretions, as well as calcium carbonate concretions.

CLIMATE
Liberty Countyâs climate can be generalized as having long and hot and humid
summers, with mild winters. Close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the
temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Winds usually trend from the
southeast or east, except in winter months when high-pressure systems can bring in polar air
from the north. Average temperatures in the summer can reach well into the 90s (degrees
Fahrenheit) and are often accompanied by equally high humidity. Although winter
temperatures have been recorded in the single digits in the past, the average temperature is 52
(degrees Fahrenheit). Below freezing temperatures usually occur on only a few days of
every year, and are typically restricted to the early morning hours.
Rainfall occurs throughout the year, but most frequently between the months of April
and September. Precipitation in Liberty County averages 136.14 centimeters (53.6 inches)
annually (Abernethy 2001; Griffith 1996; Kleiner 2001).

FLORA AND FAUNA
The northern fourth of Liberty County is part of the Big Thicket. This area is
generally described as a thickly wooded area that begins in the southern parts of Polk and
Tyler counties and ends in the south below Sour Lake, eventually merging with the coastal
prairie. The county's southern section consists of Gulf prairies and marshes vegetated with
tall prairie grasses, oak, mesquite, and prickly pear.

Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of pine, oak, ash, hickory,
cypress, and walnut. Fauna during this time would include currently present species such as
white-tailed deer and various smaller game, along with bear, panthers, and wolves, as well as
the common varieties of birds, reptiles, and amphibians.
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of various
pine species, such as loblolly and shortleaf, as well as longleaf, and slash pines, hardwoods
including oak, hickory, and maple, shrubs, Indian grass, and native legumes (Abernethy
2001; Griffith 1996; Kleiner 2001).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel, opossum,
raccoon, skunk, and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles including the
Texas rat snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and various turtle species. Black
bear and bison were present occasionally in the past (Abernethy 2001; Kleiner 2001).

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

Southeast Texas has traditionally been viewed as a buffer zone between cultural
regions. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as being an
interface between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along similar lines,
both Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic archaeological record
of this region as Woodland. This categorization is not meant to literally invoke the exact
cultural patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture found to the east. However, Aten
(1984:74) states, âit loosely connotes activities by populations on a geographic as well as a
cultural periphery of the southeastern Woodlands.â Under this framework the prehistoric
archaeology of Southeast Texas represents a mixture of diffused technology and local
innovation.
Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the culture of Southeast Texas is distinctive
enough to merit a separate designation by the Late Prehistoric. The Mossy Grove cultural
tradition is a heuristic concept based on technological similarities shared by groups in this
region. The primary marker of this technological tradition is the plain, sandy-paste Goose
Creek pottery that is found in this region from the Early Ceramic through Early Historic
periods.
Ethnic affiliations for the region are not entirely clear. Aten (1983) has defined the
Brazos Delta-West Bay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake archaeological areas and suggests
that they may correlate with the Historic territories of the Coco, Akokisa, and Atakapa
groups respectively. Similarly, historic reconstructions of the inland subregion suggest a
number of possible group affiliations (Story 1990). The historic economic inland/coastal
cycle of the Akokisa, which stretched from Galveston Bay to the San Jacinto River basin,
may mean that archaeological materials in the Lake Conroe area are affiliated with this
group. Alternately, these remains may be associated with the Bidais who occupied territory
immediately to the north of the Akokisa groups. At this point in time, it is not possible to
identify the cultural affiliation of the groups that inhabited the inland subregion. In part, this
is a function of the dynamic nature of this region in which a number of cultural traditions met
and diffused.
The Southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions,
which have archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact
types. Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland
resources year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the coast.

PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS
Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified six archaeological
time periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include
the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the
general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of
these periods. Pattersonâs (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian
(10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D.
100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the
Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas
chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D.
400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Despite these differences, the
chronologies developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point
technologies within the region and the introduction of pottery. A cultural sequence of the
Southeast Texas region is based on lithics and ceramics and the cultural context is described
by Aten (1983), Story (1990), and Ricklis (2004). This information is merged with the
archaeological data here to give a complete picture of life on the Upper Texas Coast.
Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleoindian period begins around 12,000â11,500
B.P. and ends near 9,000-8,000 B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990; Ricklis 2004). This period,
characterized by Clovis and Folsom fluted projectile points, is poorly represented in the
archaeological record for the region (Aten 1983) and no intact sites for this period have been
verified (Ricklis 2004). Isolated artifacts include Clovis, Folsom, San Patrice, Plainview,
Angostura, and Scottsbluff point types (Aten 1983; Story 1990; Turner and Hester 1993;
Ricklis 2004). Sites from the earlier portion of the Paleoindian time period that would today
be found located on shoreline would have been initially situated on tributary stream
drainages at a time when the sea level was lower (Ricklis 2004). Subsistence during the
Paleoindian stage included both hunting and gathering although there was probably an
emphasis on hunting. The quality of lithic material used to make artifacts and the scarcity of
those materials in Southeast Texas suggests a highly mobile Paleo population (Ricklis 2004)
moving in relation to available food sources.
The Transitional Archaic period begins about 9,000 B.P. and ends around 7,500 B.P.
(Aten 1983; Story 1990). This stage is also poorly represented in southeast Texas, but
isolated Keithville, Neches River, and Trinity dart points are attributed to this time period
(Story 1990; Turner and Hester 1993; Ricklis 2004). Diet begins a slow shift towards plant
processing in the Archaic, but still includes hunting. Plant processing technology seen
during the Archaic period includes stone lined hearths and baking pits as well as milling tools
(Story 1990). Groups appear to have reduced foraging distance though continued a strict
seasonal round. Population density appears to have risen during the period.

Beginning at 7,500 B.P. and spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic
period in this region is not well documented. The sites may have been destroyed or deeply
buried (Aten 1983; Story 1990). Dart points characteristic of this stage include Bell/Calf
Creek, Tortugas, and Wells types (Ricklis 2004).
The Middle Archaic period (5,000 to 3,000 B.P.) reveals the earliest surviving shell
middens (Aten 1983). These middens contain remains of shellfish, such as oysters and
estuarine clams, faunal material from terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, and the earliest
known human burials in the region (Aten 1983). Characteristic projectile points include
Yarbrough, Travis, Pedernales, and Bulverde types (Story 1990; Turner and Hester 1993;
Ricklis 2004).
The Late Archaic lasted from 3,000 to 2,000 B.P. and shows evidence for population
increase (Aten 1983). By 2500 B.P., the climate in this area was essentially modern. Ground
stone artifacts made from materials from southwestern Arkansas and found in context with
human burials in cemeteries such as the Ernest Witte Site indicate the possibility of trade
(Hall 1981) but the shift to the use of more poor-quality local materials suggests less mobility
(Ricklis 2004). Projectile points in this period are corner-notched or expanding-stemmed
forms, such as the Kent and Gary types (Story 1990, Turner and Hester 1993), along with the
Ensor and Godley points found in the western extremities of Southeast Texas (Ricklis 2004).
During the late Archaic, more utilitarian biface tools are prevalent as well as are bone tools.
Late Archaic assemblages are very similar to the early part of the Late Prehistoric stage
(Aten 1983).
The transition from the Late Archaic stage to the Prehistoric is indicated by the
introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983), moving first into the coastal
region and eventually disseminating inland (Ricklis 2004). No major shifts in lifestyle
during this period from the Late Archaic are evident (Ricklis 2004) although there were
major technological changes, such as sandy paste ceramics and, around 700 A.D., in the Late
Prehistoric period, the bow and arrow (Story 1990; Ricklis 2004). Ceramics have been
arranged into broad time intervals by Ricklis (2004), starting with the Early Ceramic around
100 A.D. and ending with the Early Historic at 1800 A.D. Characteristic projectile points are
light, small, straight and expanded stem types that include the Delhi, Ellis, Epps, Gary, Kent,
Alba, Catahoula, Cliffton, Fresno, Friley, Hayes, Perdiz, Scallorn, and Steiner points (Story
1990; Turner and Hester 1993; Ricklis 2004).
The Attakapans lived along the Lower Neches and Sabine rivers between the San
Jacinto River in Texas and Vermillion Bay, Louisiana. The Attakapans lived in five bands
that roamed the border areas between Texas and Louisiana. These five bands were known as
Vermilion Bayou, Mermentau, Calcasieu, Sabine and Neches, and Trinity. Several Texas
tribes living along the Trinity River interacted with the Attakapans, including the
Orocoquisas, Deadoes, and Bidais. The main difference between these tribes appeared to be
dialect. Culturally, these groups appeared to be very similar to the Europeans at contact. In

fact, Eighteenth Century Spanish accounts used the tribal names Attakapans and Orocoquisas
interchangeably (Kleiner 2001).

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
EAST TEXAS
European interest and exploration of what would become east Texas was centered on
the Trinity River. Spain claimed most of North America and, in an effort to better
understand the gulf coast, Garay, the Govenor of Jamaica, initiated mapping of the region
from Florida to Tampico (Barker 1929). Survey was accomplished by ship and Cabeza de
Vaca began inland exploration nine years later. Inland explorations continued randomly by
both Spanish and French explorers until 1685.
The French had successfully explored Canada and were in the process of navigating
the Mississippi when Sieur de la Salle attempted to establish a settlement at the mouth of the
great river. However, La Salle was actually in the wrong place, and established Fort Louis at
Matagorda Bay in February 1685. La Salle sent out exploration parties to the northeast from
there and it is generally accepted that La Salle journeyed up the Trinity and made contact
with a Cenis (Tejas) village located at Wyser Bluff in 1687. He crossed the Trinity and
continued eastward toward the Neches, however, this crossing is also placed near the town of
Swartwout farther south in Polk County (Yoakum 1855), and today is inundated by Lake
Livingston.
Spanish response to French exploration of their territory began in 1690. General
Alonzo de Leon was dispatched to locate and destroy French settlements in Texas. A
mission, called San Francisco, was established in place of La Salleâs settlement at Matagorda
Bay. A second expedition was conducted by de Leon to establish missions among the Tejas
Indians near the confluence of Trinity and Boggy Creek. These efforts failed and were
abandoned, leaving east Texas uninhabited by Europeans by 1693.
East Texas then became the subject of a competition between France and Spain in
1715. A French fort, Natchitoches, was established in western Louisiana, and relations with
Indian groups began. The Spanish response from Mexico was to send missionaries, followed
by settlers. The government in Mexico knew little about the region, despite earlier
expeditions (Bolton 1915).
The Spanish interest became serious when viceroy MarquÃ©s de las Amarillas
established the Trinity as an objective for the central government. The presidio of San
AugustÃ­n de Ahumada was founded July 1754, followed by the mission of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de
la Luz at San Saba in 1755. These settlements were not particularly successful, and were
recommended for abandonment by Riperda (Spanish government official) in 1767 (Bolton
1915). This was partly due to the Spanish acquisition of western Louisiana in 1769, which
had made them less important as border outposts. Many settlers were not interested in
12
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATIONâDO NOT RELEASE

abandoning the area, and this led to two new settlements. One called Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Pilar
de Bucareli with 300 persons on the Trinity. Severe flooding and fear of the Comanche are
probable reasons for its abandonment by 1779. The people relocated to Nuestra SeÃ±ora de
Guadalupe Mission. Texans know this location as the town of Nacogdoches today (Bolton
1915: 390-394).
As French power and influence declined, the United States became a player in the
region after the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. The last significant French attempt at settlement
was to colonize Bonapartist refugees at Champ d'Asile by Charles F. A. Lallemand and
Antoine Rigaud in 1818 (Kleiner 2001). The Spanish created policy to gain control of its
territory and then bring in settlers, and maintain permanent control. Don Antonio Cordero
mobilized seven detachments of about 50 men each into Texas. Five detachments went to
San Antonio, one to Matagorda, and one to Arkokisa (later the town of Liberty). The
disputed territory was declared neutral ground by both sides, pending a political resolution
(Yoakum 1855: 127-128, 270-271).
By the early nineteenth century both Spanish and American immigrants were settling
Texas. Their successful farms increased the appeal of the area around the Trinity River and
Indian groups began to settle villages: the Cenis (Tejas) to the south, the Coushatta to the
north, and the Alabama somewhere in between (Houston 1938). American settlers were the
largest and wealthiest group (Yoakum 1855:270-273).
Upon Mexican independence from Spain in 1822, relations with the United States
changed. The Mexican government encouraged Americans to immigrate to Texas.
However, Texasâ government was not strong, and was largely controlled by the Coahuila
state in Mexico (Bancroft 1884: 636-645).
At the same time Stephen F. Austin started a colonization movement in 1820 or 1821.
The weakness of the Mexican government became clear as it was unable, or unwilling, to
regulate the land grant process in Texas. This set the stage for both competing interests and
competing loyalties among settlers. Granting land contracts in an area lacking clearly
defined political boundaries lead to the Mexican government passing a law in 1830
forbidding further immigration into Texas. Manuel Mier y TerÃ¡n, Commander General of
the Eastern Department of the Mexican Republic, refused to recognize the companies giving
out land grants to settlers, creating tension among the settlers and local politicians. One
significant issue was slavery: Americans brought slaves into east Texas, but Mexico had
declared the practice illegal. American settlers, now without recognized land titles and faced
with financial and legal problems with slavery, were willing to organize militias and fight for
Texasâ independence.
In 1833, Mexico passed a law repealing the previous one of 1830. This provided for
the renewal of all land grants (Henderson 1926: 302-303, 310-313). Immigration from the
United States increased every year from when Austin began his colony in 1821 through the
1836 Texas revolution, despite Mexican efforts to regulate it. Soon, American settlers
outnumbered Mexican settlers.

LIBERTY COUNTY
Liberty County is mostly known for its role in Texasâ independence, as well as
ranching, farming, and natural resources. History of Liberty County goes beyond this and is
similar to surrounding areas. The county seat, Liberty, was first named âVilla de la
SantÃ­sima Trinidad de la Libertadâ by Mexican land commissioner JosÃ© Francisco Madero in
1831. It has been a settlement since being established on the Trinity River as a Spanish
trading post settlement called âOrcoquisaâ circa 1770.
History from the nineteenth century is more familiar to many. In 1803, with the
Louisiana Purchase, American replaced French influence in the region. Forced relocation of
the Coushatta Indians placed them on the Trinity River during this period. After Mexico won
independence from Spain, more American settlers arrived seeking promised grants of land in
what later became Liberty County.
Antebellum Liberty County was like most of east Texas. New founded plantations
were quite successful growing crops of cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, indigo, grains, and
vegetables. Lumber mills and cattle ranching boomed. The Trinity River was a busy
thoroughfare for moving materials and people and plans were designed to make it navigable
further upstream. Attempts to build a railroad from the town of Liberty to Livingston, Texas
were interrupted by the American Civil War.
Post-war Liberty County was like most of the South. Freedmen often worked for
their former masters. The Freedmanâs Bureau operated for only two years, 1866 to 1868, and
black suffrage caused conflict during Reconstruction. White and black populations were
about the same in 1880, but the black population declined soon afterward. The U.S.
government did commence with making the Trinity more navigable after 1880, and
completed that extensive project by 1940. That action benefited the town of Liberty.
Railroads eventually served other parts of the county by the turn of the twentieth century.
More changes came with the turn of the century. Population continued to grow,
doubling from 8,102 in 1900 to 19,868 in 1930. The number of farms increased (peaking at
1,961 by 1940), but their size shrunk. Oil prospecting began in 1901, and was successful in
1918 near the towns of Daisetta and Hull. Several other oil fields were soon opened and
pipeline construction soon followed. Lumbering the available timber, cotton, rice, and corn
as major crops, and raising livestock balanced the economy of Liberty County. These varied
sources of revenue reduced some effects caused by the Great Depression. World War II saw
a sharp increase in manufacturing, from 22 firms in 1940 to 52 firms in 1948. Also, by this
time more than two-thirds of the countyâs farms had electricity. Motor vehicle transportation
through Liberty County was improved with the construction of U.S. Highway 59 during the
1960s. Soybean cultivation replaced cotton and corn as major crops by the time county
population reached 47,088 in 1980.

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation
episodes. In general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin
subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratigraphic archaeological context. Historic sites near the survey area typically consist of
farm- or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries.
The primary problem facing researchers working on prehistoric sites in this region
stems from a dearth of cleanly stratified deposits. Environmental conditions leading to slow
soil development combined with rapid urbanization in many areas of southeast Texas have
complicated the already difficult task of reconstructing cultural traditions and developing
chronologies associated with the highly mobile lifeways of the prehistoric hunter-gatherer
populations formerly inhabiting this area.
The majority of larger inland sites consist of sandy middens with high lithic material
counts and moderate amounts of pottery located near water sources. These sites are
generally considered base camps and there is a notable absence of satellite activity areas.
Within the base camps distinct activity loci are present (Patterson 1995).
Lithic artifacts recovered at sites near the current survey area are primarily
manufactured from chert and petrified wood. Chert deposits are concentrated in the western
portion of the south Texas region, while petrified wood dominates in the eastern portion of
the region. This geographic parity is generally reflected in the types of materials found at
sites. Sites in the western and central portions of south Texas have predominately chert
artifacts with some petrified wood. Conversely, artifacts recovered from sites in the eastern
portion of south Texas are mainly manufactured of petrified wood (Patterson 1995:256).
Extra-local lithic materials found in the region include Edwards Plateau chert and ground
stone from Arkansas sources. The presence of these materials may suggest the presence of
regional trade networks or through the movement of groups or individuals into the region, as
in the case of the Edwards Plateau material.
Pertaining to stone tool manufacture, inland sites have a high debitage to core ratio
indicating that primary reduction most often was carried out at source locations. The
presence of point preforms in various stages of production and failure at campsites indicate
that blanks and preforms were being transported back to these locations for final reduction
(Patterson 1995). The unifacial tools found at sites are typically flakes utilized from the
bifacial thinning process. These tool types include scrapers, denticulates, notched tools,
perforators, and gravers. These formal tools occur only in small numbers at inland sites.

Projectile point types, along with ceramics on the coastal margin, are the most
distinctive artifacts associated with archaeological sites in southeast Texas. The various
types serve as hallmarks of the cultural periods of the region. These types range from the
Clovis and Folsom points found in the Early Paleoindian period, to the stemmed points of the
Archaic, to the dart points of Late Archaic/Early Ceramic, and finally to the arrow points of
the Late Prehistoric ca. A.D. 500 or 600. The projectile point technologies found in the
region were influenced by adjacent regions through time including the southern plains,
southeast woodlands, Louisiana, and north, central, and south Texas.

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This cultural resources survey was designed to identify and preliminarily assess cultural
resources that may be impacted by the proposed project, as well as to assess damage to cultural
resources impacted by activities that took place prior to this investigation.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission. Site file research was
performed in order to identify all previously recorded archaeological sites within 1.6-kilometers
(1-mile) of the survey area, and all recorded historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located
adjacent to the survey area. Site file research was used to provide a historic context to the
archaeological survey, and additional documentary research was conducted in order to provide
an understanding of the development and history of the archaeological APE, the surrounding
area, and southeast Texas in general. This research then was used to prepare an overview history
of the area, and provided an understanding of the contextual framework of Liberty Countyâs
prehistory and history. No previously recorded sites are located within this study radius.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY METHODOLOGY
The intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations associated with the current
undertaking were designed to define all sites, prehistoric and historic, within the defined
survey area. In addition to site identification, the intensive pedestrian investigations also
must provide sufficient data to determine whether or not additional investigations will be
required to evaluate fully the potential eligibility of any newly defined site location for
inclusion on the NRHP or as a state designated landmark.
Archaeological survey methods utilized during the intensive pedestrian investigations
consisted of the use of observation points. Observation points provide a reference to maintain
horizontal control and provenience across a given survey area. Shovel tests were placed at
intervals that ranged between 30 to 200 meters (98.43 to 656.2 feet). Shovel testing intervals
were decreased in areas deemed to possess a high probability for archaeological resources.
Areas of moderate to low probability were sampled at a lower frequency. Shovel tests were
not excavated in areas containing standing water.
Regardless of the interval, linear transects were utilized to facilitate survey activities
within the limits of the entire survey area. These transects were spaced at 30 meter (98.43 foot)
17
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATIONâDO NOT RELEASE

intervals and moved from west to east. Shovel testing was performed on all transects situated
within high and moderate probability areas. In low probability areas, shovel testing was
performed on alternating transects only; pedestrian reconnaissance was conducted on those
transects not sampled by shovel testing. Dependent upon the terrain, environmental setting,
and groundcover identified at each observation point location, one of three possible actions was
performed; shovel testing, walk over, or surface inspection. All actions performed at a specific
observation point location, the general observations of the surveyor, and the results of survey
actions were recorded on an observation point log, which include provenience, survey method,
and cultural materials identified.
The majority of the survey area had sufficient ground surface visibility (>30%) for
surface inspection. In areas where surface visibility was less than 30%, Phase I investigations
were performed by the excavation of 30-centimeter (12-inch) shovel tests at each observation
point. Shovel tests also were excavated in areas considered likely to contain intact subsurface
deposits regardless of surface visibility. Shovel tests were typically excavated to a maximum
depth of 100 centimeters (3 feet) into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile
subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth.
Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and the Munsell (2000)
soil color charts. All recovered diagnostic artifacts were bagged and provenienced by
observation point number. Non-diagnostic artifacts were not collected, although information
concerning horizontal and vertical provenience, artifact type, material, count, and other
pertinent information was recorded on standardized forms. The results of the shovel test
activities were recorded on the observation point log and additional information concerning soils
encountered and a profile drawing of the exposed profiles were recorded on a shovel test form
for each excavation.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The cultural resources survey was designed to assess the potential impact that
construction of the proposed Project might have on cultural resources within the survey area.

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH
During the background search, no previously identified archaeological sites or
historic structures were located within the proposed survey area or within a 1.6-kilometer (1Â­
mile) radius of the survey area. Only three sites, 41LB44, 41LB45, and 41LB46 were found
within a 3.2-kilometer (2-mile) radius of the survey area. All of them are associated with
Luce Bayou and were recorded during a survey in preparation for a diversion of the bayou in
1978. A total of six archaeological sites were recorded as a result of the survey. The three
sites located nearest to the current survey area were recorded as Prehistoric or Neo-American
campsites. Of these only 41LB44 is likely intact. The other sites were described as
destroyed by road construction (Chaffin-Lohse 1978).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
The intensive pedestrian survey was designed to assess the potential impact that
construction activities might have on archaeological resources located within the survey area.
The survey area was subdivided into 18 survey segments (Fields 1 through 5, an Access
Corridor, Access Roads 1 and 2, Pipeline ROWs 1 through 5, Well Pads 1 to 4, and a meter
site). Field 2 was further divided into 2 segments (Field 2A and 2B). Locations of all survey
segments are shown on Figure 2. The results of the intensive pedestrian survey are detailed
below.
Field 1 (415.9-Acre Tract)
Field 1 is a fallow rice field currently used as cow pasture (Plate 1). The northern
limit of the area lies approximately 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) south of Route 686. The parcel is
bounded on the west by an irrigation ditch, on the south by the Missouri Pacific railroad
ROW and on the east by a fence line. The parcel covers approximately 168 hectares (416
acres) of level ground. There is a depressed area located on the west side of Field 1, which
had standing water at the time of survey. According to the tenant, Mr. Henscey, the parcel
had been used as a rice field within the last 25 years. Preparation of the field for rice
cultivation entailed leveling of the ground with heavy machinery and dike building for water

retention. As a result, there were minimal natural contours within the parcel. While
archaeological survey was in process, a fence was being built around the east, south, and
west margins of the parcel (approximately 20 meter [65 feet] inside the property line that
resulted in disturbed soil contexts (Plate 2).
Soils in Field 1 consisted of Mocarey â Yeaton Complex soils in the western and
southern portions of the parcel and Lake Charles Clay in the north and east. High clay
content in the soils makes them poorly permeable, a sought after characteristic in rice
farming, but possibly limiting for other purposes. Soil profiles revealed during shovel testing
were consistent with the descriptions of these two soils in the NRCS Soil Survey of Liberty
County (Griffith 1996) (see Figure 3 for representative soil profiles).
A total of 171 shovel tests were excavated in Field 1. The majority of shovel tests
were excavated to a depth of 30 to 50 centimeters (11.8 to 19.7 inches). However,
periodically shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 1 meter (3.3 feet) to check for
potentially buried horizons. None were found. Transects were spaced 30 meters (98 feet)
apart and moved from west to east. Shovel tests were excavated on alternate transects with
the intervening transects being subjected to walkover inspection. Shovel tests were
excavated every 200 meters (656.17 feet), except around the inundated area at the time of
survey, where the interval was reduced to 50 meters (164.04 feet). No cultural material was
recovered from Field 1.
Field 2 (167.674-Acre Tract)
As in the case of Field 1, Field 2 is a fallow rice field currently used as cow pasture.
The northern limit of the area fronts on Route 686, while the east, south and west boundaries
are demarcated by fence lines. In the southeast corner of Field 2 there are two apparently
disused gas wells and associated buried pipes indicated to be owned by Hat Oil and Gas. The
parcel is traversed by a number of pipelines. The parcel covers approximately 68 hectares
(167 acres) of nearly level ground. According to Mr. Henscey (current tenant of the Field 1
parcel), Field 2 had been used as a rice field within the last 25 years. Preparation of the field
for rice cultivation entailed leveling of the ground with heavy machinery and dike building
for water retention. As a result, there were minimal natural contours within the parcel.
Soils in Field 2 consisted of Beaumont Clay, Bernard Morley Complex soils and Lake
Charles Clay. High clay content in the soils makes them poorly permeable, a sought after
characteristic in rice farming. Soil profiles revealed during shovel testing were consistent
with the descriptions of these three soils in the NRCS Soil Survey of Liberty County (Griffith
1996) (see Figure 3 for representative soil profiles).
To maintain sampling consistency, Field 2 was subdivided into Segment 2A and
Segment 2B. In total 70 observation points were logged for Segment 2. Shovel tests were
excavated at 67 of those points. The majority of shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 30
to 50 centimeters (11.8 to 19.7 inches). However, periodically shovel tests were excavated to

a depth of 1 meter (3.3 feet) to check for potentially buried horizons. None were found.
Transects were spaced 30 meters (98 feet) apart and proceeded from west to east. Shovel
tests were excavated on alternate transects with the intervening transects subjected to
walkover inspection. Shovel tests were excavated every 200 meters (656.17 feet), except for
the three transects closest to Route 686, where the interval was reduced to 100 meters (328
feet) because of the increased possibility for historic period sites. No cultural material was
recovered from Field 2.
Field 3 (300.5-Acre Tract)
This tract is a fallow agricultural field now being used as pasture. The northern
boundary is FM 686 and Field 1 is the southern boundary. The eastern and western limits are
bounded by fences. The area was mainly inundated from heavy rains at the time of the
survey. The field has short grasses in the northern portion near FM 686, and taller grasses in
the southern portion with sapling trees sparsely scattered throughout.
Soils in Field 3 consist mainly of Mocarey â Yeaton Complex with League Clay soil
in the southeastern corner. Small portions of the eastern and western edges of the field
consist of the Bernard Morey complex soils. High clay content in the soils makes them
poorly permeable, a sought after characteristic in rice farming. Soil profiles revealed during
shovel testing were consistent with the descriptions in the NRCS Soil Survey of Liberty
County (Griffith 1996).
A total of 368 observation points were observed in Field 3. Of those, 64 shovel tests
were excavated. Due to standing water and super-saturated soils, 304 shovel tests were not
excavated. Transects ran from north to south and were spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart.
Each shovel test was spaced approximately 100 meters (330 feet) apart, with an offset of 50
meters (164 feet). Tests went to an average depth of 40 cm (15.30 in.). All shovel tests that
were excavated were negative and no cultural material was recovered from Field 3.
Field 4 (6.463-Acre Tract)
This tract is in what appears to be, from an aerial view, a fallow rice field. There
appears to be oil activity (pump-jacks, compressors, etc.) nearby. The parcel is an area
approximately 30 meters (100 feet) wide by 494 meters (1621 feet). It is located between the
western edge of Field 3 and the southeastern corner of Field 2B and approximately 0.97
kilometers (0.60 miles) south of FM 686.
Soils in Field 4 consist primarily of Bernard - Morey complex soils with a small
portion near the western edge of Field 3 consisting of the Mocarey â Yeaton complex soils.
High clay content in the soils makes them poorly permeable and a sought after characteristic
in rice farming. Soil profiles revealed during shovel testing were consistent with the
descriptions in the NRCS Soil Survey of Liberty County (Griffith 1996).

24
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATIONâDO NOT RELEASE

A total of 18 observation points were recorded in the parcel on 2 transects. Of those,
6 shovel tests were excavated and 12 were not excavated due to standing water. Field
personnel were unable to access some areas within Field 4 due to high water. Transects went
from west to east and were 30 meters (100 feet) apart, being located on the northern and
southern boundaries. All shovel tests were spaced at 60-meter (197-foot) intervals. All
shovel tests excavated were negative and no cultural material was recovered from Field 4.
Field 5 (2.00-Acre Tract)
Field 5 is located in an active agricultural field, which has been recently cultivated at
the time of survey. This area is at the northern end of Pipeline ROW 5 (Linear 2). It is
approximately 145.27 meters (476.61 feet) long by 45.76 meters (150.13 feet) wide. It is
located approximately 3.64 kilometers (2.26 miles) north of FM 686.
Soils in Field 5 consist entirely of Beaumont Clay. High clay content in the soils
makes them poorly permeable. The soils were also disturbed as the field had been recently
cultivated. Soil profiles revealed during shovel testing were consistent with the descriptions
in the NRCS Soil Survey of Liberty County (Griffith 1996).
Shovel tests were placed at each corner of the parcel. A total of 4 observation points
were observed in the tract. Of those, 3 points were excavated and 1 was not excavated due to
saturation of the soil. All shovel tests excavated were negative and no cultural material was
recovered from Field 5.
Access Corridor
The Access Corridor, which connects Field 1 with FM 686, is approximately 30
meters (98 feet) wide and 1535 meters (5036 feet) long. An irrigation ditch is nearly
adjacent to the Access Corridor on the west, and a pipeline crosses the corridor at
approximately 715 meters (2345 feet) south of Route 686 (Plate 3). A modern, corrugated
steel machinery barn is located adjacent to the north end of the corridor. The Access
Corridor is located atop an unimproved field road that provided entry into the rice fields.
The southern portion of the Access Corridor is covered in grasses, weeds and shrubs,
however ongoing clearing for a perimeter fence resulted in soil disturbance in the northern
reaches of the corridor.
The corridor was investigated with a single transect of shovel tests and surface
inspection in areas exposed by heavy equipment. Shovel tests were spaced 100 meters (328
feet) apart and were excavated to a depth of 30 to 50 centimeters (11.8 to 19.7 inches).
Periodically shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 1 meter (3.3 feet) to check for buried
horizons. A total of 16 observation points were logged for the Access Corridor. Shovel tests
were excavated at 14 of those points. No cultural material was discovered for the Access
Corridor.

Access Road 1
Access Road 1 is oriented east-west and connects Pipeline ROW 1 with the well pads
to the east. The road is 9.14 meters (30 feet) wide and 1570.33 meters (5152 feet) long and
built on top of a dike that separates two rice fields (Plate 4). Irrigation ditches flank the
access road and Pipeline ROW 2 lies partially within the ditch to the south of Access Road 1.
Access Road 1 was subjected to walkover survey. No cultural material was discovered.
Access Road 2
Access Road 2 is oriented north-south and provides access to the well pads from
Route 686. The road is 9.14 meters (30 feet) wide and 2232.77 meters (7325.36 feet) long
and built on top of a dike that separates rice fields. Irrigation ditches flank the access road.
Access Road 2 was subjected to walkover survey. No cultural material was discovered.
Pipeline ROW 1
Pipeline ROW 1 is 15 meters (50 feet) wide and approximately 1330 meters (4363
feet) in overall length. The ROW extends north from Field 2, crosses Route 686, detours
around an oil and gas field, makes a right angle turn to the west and turns north to an
interconnect site on an existing pipeline. The ROW is primarily located in agricultural field
margin, however segments of it fall within wooded areas around the oil field (Plate 5), and a
short segment lies within corn fields. The ROW was investigated with a single transect of
shovel tests and surface inspection in areas with good surface visibility. Shovel tests were
spaced 100 meters (328 feet) apart and were excavated to a depth of 30 to 50 centimeters
(11.8 to 19.7 inches). Periodically shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 1 meter (3.3
feet) to check for buried horizons. A total of 36 observation points were logged. Shovel
tests were excavated at 21 of those points. A derelict structure (Structure 1) of recent origin
was identified outside of the ROW (Plate 6). The structure may have been associated with
the oil and gas field, was photographed and its location recorded with GPS. No cultural
resources were identified within the ROW.
Pipeline ROW 2
Pipeline ROW 2 extends east-west and connects the proposed well pads with Pipeline
ROW 1. The ROW is 15 meters (50 feet) wide and approximately 1012 meters (3320 feet)
long. The ROW lies partially within an irrigation ditch that parallels the southern border of
Access Road 1. The ditch was subjected to visual inspection and no cultural resources were
discovered.
Pipeline ROW 3
Pipeline ROW 3 is oriented north-south and extends along the west sides of Well
Pads 1, 2, 3, and 4. The ROW is 15 meters (50 feet) wide and approximately 920 meters
26

(3018 feet) long. The ROW lies within former rice fields similar to those found in Field 1,
Field 2, and Pipeline ROW 1. The extensive shovel testing (and complete absence of cultural
materials) in those areas indicated that Pipeline ROW 3 had virtually no chance of yielding
significant cultural material. This inference was bolstered by the negative results from
shovel tests excavated in adjacent Pad 2, Pad 3, and Pad 4. Therefore, the ROW was
subjected to visual inspection and no cultural resources were discovered.
Pipeline ROW 4 (Linear 1)
Pipeline ROW 4 starts at FM 686 and runs north to a two-track dirt road (Access
Road 1). It measures approximately 2 kilometers (1.29 miles) long and 30 meters (100 feet)
wide. The ROW runs on the east side of Pipeline ROW 1 and follows its path. It was
surveyed using one transect running the length of the ROW. A total of 18 points were
observed. Out of those 18 points, only 3 shovel tests were excavated. The ROW is primarily
located in cultivated agricultural fields, with a short segment in a cornfield. There is also a
small portion located in a wooded area approximately 1.20 kilometers (0.77 miles) from the
beginning of the ROW at FM 686. The same structure that was observed in ROW 1 was also
observed in ROW 4 (Linear 1). As was with ROW 1, no cultural material was found.
Pipeline ROW 5 (Linear 2).
Pipeline ROW 5 extends north from the two-track dirt road where ROW 4 ends and
runs approximately 1.56 kilometers (0.97 miles) long and 30 meters (100 feet) wide. It is
approximately 74.45 meters (244.27 feet) east of Pipeline ROW 1. The ROW lies entirely in
two separate active agricultural fields that are divided by a two-track dirt road that is used to
access the different fields in the area. It was surface surveyed due to 100 percent ground
visibility and the soils being disturbed from the cultivation process. No cultural material was
observed.
Well Pads
Pad 1 (#4) is an approximately 90 by 90-meter (295 by 295-foot) or 0.8-hectare (2Â­
acre) area located north of Access Road 1. The area was located in a disked and rain washed
field and was subjected to surface inspection (Plate 7). No cultural material was discovered.
Pads 2 through 4 are near one another and are nearly identical in layout and context. Pad 2
(#3), Pad 3 (#2), and Pad 4 (#1) are each 90 by 90-meter (295 by 295-foot) or 0.8-hectare (2Â­
acre) areas located between Access Road 2 to the east and Pipeline ROW 3 to the west. The
pads are located in an agricultural field that was once used for rice cultivation. However at
the time of survey the ground was covered in standing cornstalks, which covered over 90
percent of the ground surface (Plate 8). Each pad was investigated with surface investigation
and a single shovel test excavated in its center. No cultural material was recovered.

Meter Station
The proposed meter station is located inside the workspace of Pipeline ROW 4
(Linear 1), approximately 300 meters (984.25 feet) south of Access Road 1. This area
measures 45.72 by 45.72 meters (150 by 150 feet) and is composed of cultivated agricultural
field and was therefore subjected to visual inspection only. No cultural material was found.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
conducted on approximately 388.09 hectares (958.99 acres) of property proposed for the
development of salt dome natural gas storage caverns and associated facilities in Liberty
County, Texas.
In August 2006, HRA Gray & Pape LLC, of Houston, Texas, undertook an intensive
pedestrian cultural resources investigation for the proposed Enstor Houston Hub Storage and
Transportation Project in Liberty County, Texas. The storage facility will include salt dome
storage caverns, natural gas compression facilities, natural gas, raw water and brine transport
pipelines, electrical infrastructure, pipeline interconnect sites, natural gas
injection/withdrawal, raw water withdrawal and deep injection well pads, and access roads,
resulting in a total area for the Project of approximately 273.57 hectares (676 acres). The
archaeological APE for the project consists of all property within the 388.09-hectare (958.99acre) survey area.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site files search to
identify the presence of previous surveys and recorded sites in close proximity to the survey
area. Background research indicated that no cultural resources surveys were previously
conducted within the survey area. No previously identified archaeological sites are located
within or immediately adjacent to the survey area.
The field investigation consisted of reconnaissance and pedestrian survey and
subsurface shovel testing. A total of 353 shovel tests were placed in potentially disturbed
and undisturbed areas of the 388.09-hectare (958.99-acre) survey area; however, the vast
majority of the survey area, if not all of it, showed signs of previous and ongoing disturbance
due to agriculture.
Shovel tests ranged from between 30 centimeters and 1 meter (11.8 inches and 3.3
feet) in depth. Prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were not encountered during
subsurface testing in any of the survey segments. Test results show the entire survey area to
have been disturbed by ongoing and former agricultural practices.
No other cultural remains were detected. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no
further archaeological work be required for this project and that the project proceed as
planned.
