ABSTRACT
The City of Fort Worth is making plans for improvements to the north side
of Cottonwood Creek in the existing Sandy Lane Park which is located in
the eastern part of the city south of Interstate Highway 30 and west of
Village Creek. The City of Fort Worth contracted with AR Consultants, Inc.
(ARC) to conduct a cultural resource survey to determine the prehistoric
and historic archaeological presence in the project area. A total of 1.5 acres
was surveyed, focusing on wooded areas. ARC conducted the cultural
resources survey on January 15, 2016.
No prehistoric or historic archaeological sites were found during the survey.
It had been predicted that prehistoric sites might be found in unmapped
overbank flood levees; however, no sites or levees were found. It was
predicted that no historic sites would be encountered and this proved to be
the case. Given the results of this survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends
that further cultural resource investigations are unnecessary for this project,
and requests that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this
recommendation.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Fort Worth is making plans for improvements to the north side of Cottonwood Creek
in the existing Sandy Lane Park which is located in the eastern part of the city south of Interstate
Highway 30 and west of Village Creek (Figure 1). The City of Fort Worth contracted with AR
Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct a cultural resource survey to determine the prehistoric and
historic archaeological presence in the project area. A total of 1.5 acres was surveyed, focusing on
wooded areas.
The cultural resource investigation was required because Fort Worth is a State entity and Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 7525 was issued for the archaeological survey. Relevant legislation
includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). The
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission will review this report on behalf of the
State. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291).
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural resources are present in the
wooded areas immediately north of Cottonwood Creek and to make recommendations about their
significance and how they might be impacted by the park improvements. The survey was
conducted by Allen Rutherford on January 15, 2016.
This report was written in accordance with the report guidelines prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the natural environment
and the cultural history of the region. This is followed by a description of the research design and
methodology. The results of the investigation follow and constitute the body of the report. The last
chapter presents recommendations that arise from the study and a list of references cited concludes
the report. Shovel test descriptions are included at the end of the Results chapter.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is situated within the Eastern Cross Timbers Ecoregion of Texas (Griffith et al.
2007). The Cross Timbers Ecoregion is a transitional zone between the prairie to the west and the
forested, low hills to the east. This region features low, stair-step hills and plains (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1996). Vegetation includes post and blackjack oaks with sparse honey
mesquite and grasses. The proposed project area is on the northern edge of the perennial
Cottonwood Creek that flows west to east through the park.
The Woodbine formation is mapped as underlying the park site (Bureau of Economic Geology
1988). The Woodbine consists of an approximately 175 to 250 foot thick layer of Cretaceous-era
sandstone, clay, and shale.
The entire project area is mapped as Pulexas fine sandy loam, frequently flooded (Ressel
1981:Sheets 26 and 32). The Pulexas series has a 10-in-thick A horizon of light yellowish brown
fine sandy loam above a C horizon of similar makeup.

CULTURE HISTORY
A prehistoric chronology, based on Prikryl (1990), with an added historic period, for North Central
Texas is presented below to provide the reader with a temporal framework for the culture history
of the region.
Historic European

A.D. 1800 to Present
A.D. 1600 to A.D. 1800 [Historic Native American]

A.D. 1400 to A.D. 1600
A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1400

6,000 B.C. to A.D. 700
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

The Paleoindian period is characterized as having small, nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers whose
primary emphasis was the exploitation of now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison.
Smaller game and plant gathering likely supplemented the Paleoindian diet (Meltzer and Bever
1995:59). As such, the archaeological record for the region consists of several distinctive styles of
projectile points, such as the Clovis, Plainview and Folsom. Currently, no Clovis points have been
reported in Tarrant County, but numerous others have been found in the surrounding counties
(Bever and Meltzer 2007:67-70). These subsistence patterns began to change as a general drying
climatic trend swept the region, leading to extinction of many of the areaâs large mammals toward
the end of the Paleoindian period.
The Archaic period is characterized by increased alluviation of water channels and a generally
wetter environment than the previous period. This change in climate resulted in modification of
Native American subsistence patterns, with broad exploitation of bottomland food resources. This,
in turn, resulted in clusters of seasonal settlements along large drainages, including the Trinity
River and its various forks and tributaries, and a marked increase in population density. With the
advent of repeated, seasonal occupation of sites along drainages came a perceived increase in
territorial constrictions among different groups in the region, with several authors citing the limited
use of regional lithic resources as evidence of this trend (Skinner 1981; Prewitt 1983).
The Late Prehistoric period is interpreted as a dryer period, with a focus on procurement of faunal
resources, agriculture, and food preservation. The appearance of pottery and the bow and arrow
help date artifact assemblages to this period (Shafer 1977). The Protohistoric period is
characterized by Native American abandonment of north central Texas in the period around
1500/1600, with almost no archaeological evidence found in the region dating to this time (Skinner
1988).
The Historic European period saw widespread Anglo settlement of north central Texas beginning
in the 1830s. This expansion often resulted in brutal conflicts between settlers and nomadic bands
of Native Americans (Garrett 1972:24). These early conflicts gave way to various Anglo strategies
aimed at cohabitation, including peace treaties signed as early as 1843. Eventually, the entirety of

north central Texas was settled, with numerous Anglo military installations established in the
region. The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day Grapevine,
was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). Only 150 families and
single pioneers took advantage of the Peters Colony land grants to settle in Tarrant County (Garrett
1972:57). Many of the families that obtained land through these grants maintained and farmed
their land well into the mid-twentieth century.
After Texas became part of the United States in 1845, peace was short lived. The Civil War took
its toll on the north central Texas population, as most of the able-bodied men left to fight for the
Confederacy. Tarrant County continued to grow and prosper after the war. Fort Worth was spurred
by growth of the cattle industry and the arrival of the Texas and Pacific Railway in 1876. By 1870,
it is estimated that 300,000 head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth and the primary
industry throughout Tarrant County was agricultural into the 20th century. This industry was
replaced by manufacturing soon after the Great Depression. Defense factories built near Grand
Prairie for the development of goods for World War II attracted those seeking work. From the
1940s onward, many factories in Tarrant County continued to produce a wide variety of products,
including airplanes, helicopters, mobile homes, electronics, and plastics. The development of
DFW International Airport, and increased manufacturing and industrialization in the communities
of Arlington, Euless, and Fort Worth, in the 1970s led to a rapid rise in the population of the
surrounding communities.
Previous Investigations
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA 2015), one archaeological survey of 3.72
acres was conducted within the limits of Sandy Lane Park and it was done in conjunction with
plans for a pipeline designated the Koch Index 1 Pipeline (Turpin 2001). No sites were discovered
in the park area which is mapped as including 28.7 acres. Apparently no survey of the park site
was conducted when it was established and very little survey work has been done in the
surrounding one mile radius area. Several years ago ARC surveyed a proposed church site to the
north (Skinner 1998) but found no evidence of historic or prehistoric occupation. Similar results
occurred in association with pipeline, road, and block surveys in the surrounding one mile diameter
area. Despite the apparent low density of archaeological sites, buried sites have been found in the
floodplains of major and minor tributaries of the West Fork of the Trinity River and Sandy Lane
Park does provide similar settings (Prikryl 1990; Skinner et al. 1999).
Sam Streets 1893 map of Tarrant County and the 1920 Tarrant County soil map were reviewed for
information about historic use of the park site and they present no evidence that historic structures
more than 95 years old were ever on the property. This condition remains the same as shown on
Tarrant County Highway maps printed in 1936 and in the 1950s. The Kennedale, TX 7.5â USGS
shows no structures on the property but the Tarrant County Soil Survey report that was printed in
1981 appears to show buildings and cleared areas but most of the park site was tree covered. A
baseball diamond and other park structures are shown on a 1995 aerial photograph. The park is
clearly shown on the recent aerial photograph.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on the research conducted prior to the survey, two hypotheses were developed. First, it was
hypothesized that prehistoric archaeological sites might be encountered in the project area. This
hypothesis was based on the possibility that unmapped overbank flood levies may be present in
the undisturbed tree-covered areas north of Cottonwood Creek.
The second hypothesis states that there was low potential for encountering historic sites in the
property. There are no structures or features shown on the historic maps in the project area and
residential features are not expected to have been built in floodplains. Historic trash scatters may
be located along or in the drainage.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field personnel
walked the property in transects no more than 30 m apart. Three shovel tests were excavated for
every acre surveyed. Shovel tests were placed in or near the undisturbed tree-covered areas on the
north side of the creek. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. All silty and loamy soils were
screened through Â¼â screens. The clay fill was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks
in order to determine if cultural materials were present. Shovel test matrices were described on the
basis of composition, texture, and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify
soil colors. The author made notes about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and disturbed
areas where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken during the survey using a 16-megapixel,
digital camera. Shovel test and project boundary locations were marked with a handheld Garmin
GPSmap78 receiver.

RESULTS
The results of the Sandy Lane Park Improvements survey are presented in three sections. The
terrain and environmental setting of the project area are described first, followed by the results of
the survey. The final section presents conclusions with regard to the results of the survey. Shovel
tests are described generally throughout the chapter, but are detailed in Table 1 found at the end of
the Survey Results section.
Project area
The Sandy Lane Park Improvements project area is located in a floodplain setting on the north side
of Cottonwood Creek. The majority of the survey area is part of the existing park infrastructure
and was mowed grass with 80 to 90 percent ground visibility (Figure 2). The far eastern end of the
survey area was densely wooded with junipers, post oaks, hardwood saplings, and invasive
greenbrier (Figure 3). There were quite a few downed trees and some ankle high grasses and leaf
cover on the floor. Ground visibility in this area was 0 to 10 percent. Two additional wooded areas
just south of Sandy Lane Park Drive in the southwest area of the park had a similar natural setting.
The banks of the creek south of the baseball field have been covered by a gabion surface and the
slope from the baseball field fence to the gabion surface is graded (Figure 4). The westernmost
end of the creek in the park looks to have been channelized and has an energy dissipation structure
directing water into the park after it passes under Sandy Lane (Figure 5). In general, most of the
park area, including the creek banks, has been heavily disturbed.

Survey Results
A total of 1.5 acres was surveyed along the north side of Cottonwood Creek. Six shovel tests were
excavated in or near wooded areas (Figure 6). Shovel tests (ST) 2 and 4-6 had a general soil profile
consisting of a top 30-40 cm thick layer of strong brown loamy sand followed by a 15-45 cm thick
layer of reddish yellow sand underlain by a layer of pale brown sandy clay (Table 1). ST 1 and 3
had similar soil profiles. ST 3 had a 10 cm thick layer of strong brown loamy clay underlain by a
heavily disturbed layer of mottled clay. ST 1 had 40 cm of mottled clay. All shovel tests were
negative.

Conclusions
No prehistoric archaeological sites, features, or artifacts were identified during the survey. It was
anticipated that prehistoric site deposits might have been found in the floodplain sediments or on
unmapped overbank flood levees, but no prehistoric cultural materials or levees were found. As
expected, no historic sites were identified.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present
along the north side of Cottonwood Creek in Sandy Lane Park in Fort Worth, Texas. No prehistoric
archaeological sites or artifacts were recorded. Additionally, no historic sites were identified. ARC
concludes that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted within the proposed project
area and recommends that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this assessment.
However, if buried cultural materials are discovered during construction, the Archeology Division
of the Texas Historical Commission and Fort Worth District of the USACE should be notified.
