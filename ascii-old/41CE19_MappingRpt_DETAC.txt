ABSTRACT
Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) prepared a GIS model of the
George C. Davis site (41CE19) for the Texas Historical Commission. The UTM based
model included excavations and geophysical surveys which referenced the excavation grid
of the site. Shovel tests and other non-grid referenced excavations were omitted because
of their lack of proper georeferencing or excavation grid location. The research included
collecting relevant materials from TARL, creating a virtual grid, and georeferencing the
TARL data and the virtual grid to known datums on the site. To maintain this powerful
management tool, any future proposed archaeological work on the site should include the
use of the excavation grid with surveying instruments (Total Station or Survey-grade GPS).

INTRODUCTION
Between January and June 2016, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
built a Geographical Information System (GIS) model of the George C. Davis site (41CE19)
upon request by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) State Historic Sites Division. The GIS
model overlays the previous excavations conducted on the site to the NAD 1983 UTM Zone 15
North Datum to maintain a record of excavated areas and facilitate relocating the excavation grid
for future excavations. No Texas Antiquities Permit was obtained because no excavations were
conducted as part of these investigations.
The GIS model included collecting available data from the Texas Archaeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), incorporating that information into the GIS, creating a virtual
excavation grid to match the excavation grid, and reprojecting the previous excavations to the
NAD 1983 datum by using post-processed GPS points of four excavation grid datums. The
resulting georeferenced datums are within 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) of the stated location.
This work will help relocate excavation units using survey-grade GPS and provides standards for
the use of GPS data collection on the site. The use of a total station on the existing excavation
grid remains the best means of relocating excavations and laying out new excavations; however,
sub-meter GPS can be used if the data meets the standards outlined below.
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The study area incorporates the current Caddo Mounds State Historic Site property
boundaries. This 161 hectare (397 acre) property includes most of the Quaternary Terrace
adjacent to the Neches River floodplain between Bowles Creek and Duren Lake (Figure 1). The
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas illustrates the approximate location of several surveys in the
area; however, the current investigations rely on those excavations and geophysical surveys that
can be accurately located using the excavation grid or sub-meter GPS and incorporated into a
GIS. Other investigations are described below, but because of the inaccuracy of the initial data
collection are omitted from the GIS.

EXISTING EXCAVATION DATA
As described in Goodmaster (2012:21), the first documentation of the site includes notes
by Nicolas de Lafora in 1767 and a letter by Athanase de Mezierezâs in 1779. The mound
locations are also illustrated on the reproduction of the 1806 Juan Pedro Walker map showing
the mounds in relation to the surrounding landscape as âMonuments Indigenesâ.
Story (2000:3-4, Table 1) describes the excavations at the site for the twentieth century.
The first documentation by an archaeologist was in 1919 by J.E. Pearce followed by uncontrolled
surface collection by E.B. Sayles. The first documented excavation was conducted by Newell
and Kreiger (1949) of roughly 60% of Mound A and a second area 100 m2 along the margin of
the terrace as part of a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project from 1939 to 1941 (Spock
1977:5). The most extensive and well documented excavations were conducted by Dee Ann
Story between 1968 and 1970 (Story 1972; 1997). These excavations included portions of
Mound B and Mound C, the borrow pit area, as well as several units in the village area. Creel
and Baxter (1979) excavated several test units in the northern portion of the property. Texas
Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) and Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) excavated
several units for park infrastructure in 1977 (Fields 1978) and 1978 (Thurmond and
Kleinschmidt 1979). Dee Ann Story returned to the site for additional excavations in 1979 and
1980 in the village area (Story 1981). TPWD and TARL contracted Prewitt and Associates to
excavate areas adjacent to Hwy 21 for the initial park facilities (Fields and Thurmond 1980) and
for the interpretive center, park residence, and maintenance facilities in 1987 (Davis et al. 1992).
All of the excavations for these projects were conducted on the excavation grid Story established
in 1968 and the excavations by Newell and Kreiger were referenced onto the excavation map.
The 1968 and afterward excavations are maintained in a database at TARL referencing the
excavation grid and not a geospatial coordinate system.
Geophysical remote sensing surveys were conducted across the majority of the site. The
first documented work included ground penetrating radar and magnetometer surveys north of
Hwy 21 and to the areas north of and adjacent to Weeping Mary Road (Creel et al. 2005; 2008)
using the existing excavation grid for reference. Upon acquisition of the property south of Hwy
21, the THC (Osborne et al. 2008) and Walker (2011) conducted geophysical surveys of the area
on the terrace south of Hwy 21. Neither investigation was oriented with the site excavation grid
but Walker (2011) recorded the location of his geophysical survey transects and with a RTK
3

GPS. Walker (2011:9) also recorded site datum N850/W1080 with the RTK unit in WGS84
Zone 15 North. Otherwise, the geophysical surveys produced maps showing the relative locations of
several anomalies, but only the work by Creel and others (2005 and 2008) are directly related to the siteâs
excavation grid for provenience.
Other work since the turn of the century on the site is limited to shovel testing and
monitoring various excavations. Perttula and Nelson (2010) excavated 24 shovel tests in the area
north of Weeping Mary Road to look for the ranchito shown on the Juan Pedro Walker map
despite the excavation of 196 square meters by Creel and Baxter (1979) on the same landform.
Likewise, shovel testing around the recently rebuilt visitorâs center by Treiweiler and Stenle
(2012) overlapped with the excavations by Davis and others (1992) for the initial visitor center
and the disturbance by the first visitor center construction. The monitoring of a trail expansion
and interpretive sign locations by Geo-Marine (Goodmaster 2012) was essential given the
proximity to Mound C and the total area of the proposed impact. Goodmaster used sub-meter
GPS to record shovel test locations and, if features were encountered, the feature location could
be accurately recorded, but that data was not curated at TARL with the other 41CE19 digital
information. Likewise, SWCA monitored excavation of 238 fence posts along the perimeter of
the property (Peyton and Lowe 2010). Fortunately, the location of the Geo-Marine and SWCA
work can be recreated by recording the trail location. Recently, shovel testing of two areas for
building a reconstructed Caddo Grass House (Perttula et al. 2016) and shovel tests along the
margin of the landform southeast of Mound A to look for a possible Spanish Mission by Tim
Perttula and others (n.d.) utilized consumer grade GPS with an assumed accuracy of 3 to 5 m (10
to 16 ft).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations began by visiting the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) to assess any digital and hard copy information about the location of the excavation
datums and excavation units.

Paper maps and logs from the previous investigations were

evaluated for information and incorporated into digital format for inclusion into the GIS
provided the site excavation grid was used for provenience.
The digital data and digital images of the hard copy maps were incorporated into the GIS.
Data and images were georeferenced to a virtual grid which was scaled and rotated to match sub4

meter GPS locations of the excavation grid datums. Digital images of the 1968-70 excavation
maps with excavation unit Northing/Westing designations were used to refine and virtually test
the excavation units location against the georeferenced excavation grid.
Ground truthing and further refinement of the GIS was accomplished by importing the
excavation datum UTM locations into submeter GPS units, navigating to the datum locations,
using a metal detector to find the physical datum, and taking multiple GPS points. The submeter
GPS data was incorporated into the GIS, and used to further refine the virtual excavation grid
and the recorded excavations.
The GIS with the virtual excavation grid, previous excavations, and any geophysical data
are archived at TARL and provided to the THC. Recommendations for documenting any future
excavations are provided below.
RESULTS
The mapping project began with a visit to TARL to recover the necessary data for the site
mapping. The collections at TARL include the hard copies of the excavation notes, journals,
artifact analysis, and maps of the excavations from the twentieth century as well as digital copies
of the geophysical data from Creel 2005, 2008 and Walker 2011. Hard copies of the excavation
maps showing excavation blocks and excavation grid providence were photographed. TARL
staff shared the digital data which was built in ArcView but used the excavation grid datum
instead of a georeferenced datum. Digital data included excavation blocks from the twentieth
century, magnetometer data, and structure outlines based on the magnetometer and excavation
data.
GIS data files, obtained from TARL, were missing all spatial reference information. The
data files included the George C. Davis excavation datums, excavation units, and geophysical
testing data. In a GIS the TARL data displayed as having an undefined coordinate system with
no projection information. There were no references to a horizontal control datum; however, the
data was referenced to a Cartesian Coordinate System that represented the archaeological
excavation grid. For example, the geophysical mapping unit N950/W1110 is represented in the
GIS as -1110.00, 950.00 which maintains its spatial integrity in relation to the excavation grid.

A robust GIS system can be used by site staff and archaeological researchers to clearly
communicate the spatial locations of archaeological investigations over time and across the
entire Caddo Mounds site. To effectively utilize the TARL data in a GIS, a custom projection
was created to reproject the data into the Universal Transverse Mercator projection utilizing the
NAD-1983 datum. The TARL data does not include an archaeological grid dataset but does
include both the excavation datums and 90 excavation units that have the archaeological
excavation grid designations as attributes. The excavation units encompass an area that is
approximately 702 meters across east to west and 1,105 meters across north to south.
To aid in future investigations, a fishnet grid representing the Siteâs archaeological grid
was created, added to the GIS, rotated approximately 5 degrees ENE, and matched to the
excavation datums. The grid squares represent the actual excavation grid as represented by
TARLâs excavation units. The GIS excavation grid includes designations for 1,000 meters, 500
meters, 100 meters, 10 meters, and 1 meter (Figure 2). The grid encompasses 988 acres (399.83
hectares) with the 100 meter grid having 400 polygons and the 1 meter grid having
approximately 4 million individual polygons.

The newly created archaeological grid is

approximately 2,675 meters north to south and 1,925 meters east to west and encompasses the
entire Caddo Mounds SHS property boundary (Figure 2 insert).
The four previous excavation datums were located with minimal metal detection using
coordinates calculated from the GIS. Ground location coordinates for the datums were obtained
using a submeter GNSS GPS receiver that has a stated horizontal accuracy of 60 centimeters.
The datum are steel bolts placed in the center of concrete footings (Figure 3 insert). A digital
copy of a blueprint composite of the George C. Davis excavations was georeferenced to the
archaeological datums and used to verify the correct locations of the GIS excavation units
(Figure 3). A base map utilizing aerial photography flown on February 16, 2014 was added to
the GIS and used for additional location verification. The Pictometryâ¢ aerial imagery has 20
centimeter resolution allowing for clear visual conformation of feature locations (Figure 4).
The TARL data included geophysical testing results which were added to the GIS and
matched to their spatial locations according to the archaeological grid (Figure 4). The George C.
Davis GIS allows for combining current aerial photographs, previous excavation unit locations,
and geophysical testing results in their correct location in reference to the siteâs archaeological

decision making and investigative research (Figure 5).
SUMMARY AND RECOMENDATIONS
The georeferencing of previous research at the George C. Davis site to the NAD 1983
UTM Zone 15 North Datum is an essential part of maintaining the record of excavation and
planning of future archaeological work. The georeferenced excavation grid will limit redundant
excavations and insure future work meets the same standard of data collection as established in
the initial excavations. Georeferenced magnetometer data allows accurate location of identified
anomalies on the siteâs excavation grid. The GIS can also be expanded to include excavated
features, artifact data, and any other special samples or attribute data.
The mapping project began with a visit to TARL to recover the existing data for the site.
Site maps and digital data was incorporated into a GIS. The data was projected, scaled and
rotated onto the NAD 1983 UTM Zone 15 coordinates and a virtual excavation grid was built
using the site excavation grid datums. Four original excavation grid datums were relocated using
the predicted GPS coordinates. Once relocated, GPS positions of the datums were matched to
the virtual excavation grid and the twentieth century excavation blocks.
Future excavations should use the existing excavation grid to insure accurate unit
placement and excavation documentation. Unrecorded excavations or excavations not
referencing the existing excavation grid will bias further scientific investigations proportionally.
The use of consumer grade GPS is unacceptable as collection of a single point with an assumed
accuracy of 3 to 5 m (10 to 16 ft) actually means that point may be in one of up to 110 of the
surrounding 1x1m excavation grid units.

Any scope of work should include either using the

existing excavation grid with a total station or using a survey-grade GPS with the real-time
submeter coordinates capability. At least three of the existing permanent site datums should be
recorded by each unit each day of the mapping.
Regardless of the unit size, all excavations should continue to reference the southeast
corner of each unit as established by Story in the 1960âs and perpetuated to other excavations in
the twentieth century. Excavations should be a uniform and measured size (e.g., 50x50 cm or
1x1 m unit). Shapefiles for the excavations should be curated at TARL and added to the current
database for the site.
