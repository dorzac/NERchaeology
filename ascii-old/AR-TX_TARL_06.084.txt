INTRODUCTION
In compliance with regulations prerequisite for a
surface mining permit, the Lower Colorado River Authority
(LCRA) requested the Texas Archeological Survey (TAS), the
University of Texas at Austin, to conduct a cultural resource
investigation of the proposed Powell Bend Lignite Prospect,
Bastrop County, Texas (Fig. 1). TAS initiated study within
the prime mining area and provided recommendations which
resulted in further assessment through subsurface testing of
four selected cultural sites. The testing program is intended
as a site evaluative procedure to assist in making final
recommendations and does not fulfill mitigative requirements.
The survey was authorized under Permit 291, issued to the LCRA
by the Texas Antiquities Committee; test excavations were
authorized under Permit 298.
This report documents the findings of the survey, the
results of the testing program and details evaluations of
potentially significant sites subject to different miningrelated land use objectives. Archeological investigative
goals were:
1) To precisely locate and evaluate the present condition of
any archeological or historical resources known to exist or to
have existed within the study area, especially those sites
(if any) listed on, or under consideration for, the National
Register of Historic Places;
2) To conduct an intensive survey to locate any previously
unrecorded sites, and to assess their present condition;
3) To provide an evaluation of the interpretative potential
of these sites for scientific or historic research; and
4) To present recommendations of feasible measures to mitigate,
avoid, or otherwise minimize adverse effects to any site of
demonstrable significance.
Equal emphasis was placed on prehistoric and historic
resources. During the course of investigations it became
clear that the vast majority of extant historic sites within
the study area were those associated with past mining operations. The historic segment of this study was, then, generally
oriented to an overview of the historic lignite industry of
Texas, and specifically to mining activities within the
study area.
The survey was conducted during intermittent periods in
October and December, 1981, and January, 1982. Testing within
the mining zone was initiated on January 13 and completed by
January 29. Field archeologists were Dan Prikryl, Jeff Girard,
Douglas Comstock and Bruce Nightengale. Leland Bement and
David Brown supervised the testing program. Bement conducted
the subsequent analysis of recovered materials and wrote the
test excavation section of this report. David S. Dibble,

LOCATION AND SETTING
Bastrop County is located in southeast central Texas
and is bounded by Williamson and Lee counties on the north,
Travis County on the west, and Caldwell, Gonzales and Fayette
counties on the south. Situated in the west Gulf Coastal
Plain (Fenneman 1938), Bastrop County covers 890 square miles
of rolling uplands and flat lowlands, moderately dissected by
small streams draining primarily into the Colorado River.
The Powell Bend Lignite Prospect lies in the northern
section of Bastrop County approximately 4.5 mi. north of the
city of Bastrop and 1.25 mi. south of Sayersville, Texas.
Varying in elevation from 520 to 380 feet AMSL, the Prospect
contains 1200 acres of gravel-laden slopes and upland drainages
of the Colorado River system. Bounded on the east by State
Highway 95 and on the north by the track of the MissouriKansas-Texas Railway, the prospect is situated near the
present facilities of the Camp Swift Military Reservation,
the University of Texas Cancer Research Center and the Federal
Correctional Institution.
The prime lignite mining zone is a single tract of 400
acres. Mining-related construction is anticipated for an
additional 800-acre area, which is partitioned into two tracts:
one lies west-northwest of the mining zone and the other adjoins to the east-southeast.
Geology
The surface geology of Bastrop County is dominated by
outcrops of Eocene formations roughly structured in parallel
bands striking to the northeast. Members of the Wilcox Group
underlie the Powell Bend Prospect and include the lignitebearing units. Bounded by the Midway Group below and the
Carrizo sand above, the Wilcox Group is divided into three
formations: The Calvert Bluff, Simsboro and Hooper
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1974). The Calvert Bluff formation,the principal outcrop within the ~ospect, is the major
lignite-bearing unit and consists mostly of mudstone with
various amounts of sandstone, lignite and ironstone concretions.
Underlying the Calvert Bluff is the Simsboro Formation, a
massive sand as thick as 800 feet, which overlies the mud,
sand and minor lignite of the Hooper (Kaiser, Ayers and LaBrie
1980). A major exposure of the Simsboro occurs west of the
Calvert Bluff in the western section of the Powell Bend study
area. The deep sands found in the vicinity of Sandy Creek
may be attributable to a Simsboro origin.
Overlying much of the upland hills and slopes of the

LOCATION ANV SETTING

4

study area, redeposited Tertiary gravels associated with the
Uvalde Gravels (Byrd 1971) are exposed in open fields and
rangelands, and sometimes line terrace edges along creeks
meandering through densely wooded areas. Although not conclusively examined, the lag deposits appear generally confined to areas above the 450-foot contour, an~ more frequently,
mixed with shallowly soiled overburden or exposures of Calvert
Bluff mudstones and weathered clays. These gravels are spread
over the greater part of the mining zone and the adjoining
south-southeastern buffer tract. The gravels vary in type,
size and qualit~ which determines their potential for stone
tool manufacture. Most commonly, rounded cobbles and cobble
fragments of chert and quartzite were observed; silicified
wood fragments were also noted. Although also occurring in
scattered association with these lithologic types, slabs of
sandstone appeared more commonly as surface exposures or
shallowly buried deposits of the local geology. Generally,
the gravel deposits provide a potential source of lithic raw
materials, a readily available source for cobble procurement
and lithic reduction.
Topography
The terrain found in the Powell Bend Prospect can be
characterized as rolling hills with gentle to steep slopes
incised by upland drainages. The gradient of slopes generally
approximates five to ten percent and, thus, accelerates the
erosion of surface materials and, sometimes, intermingles
collivial and alluvial sediments along the margins of the primary channels. The principal terrain features recognized
within the study area proper include the divides between
tributary drainages, valley margins and slope projection terraces and flood plain.
The divides are represented by hills and upland crests
generally above the headward edge of finger tributaries. As
a result of both land use and erosion, surface materials
have often been denuded on the rounded, convex surface of
these hills, exposing clays and gravels. Shallow troughs are
eroded into the surfaces except in areas stabilized by ground
cover.
Valley margins are characterized by sloping surfaces
which decline toward the drainage edge. In areas of active
runoff and headwater incision, the valley margins are degraded
on the upper and mid-slope positions. They sometimes terminate in projecting lobes of slope projections, often formed
in intergrading toeslope and alluvial terrace deposits. The
surface soils of the valley margins are sandy or sandy loams
varying in depth.
The terraces are basically formed of level deposits of

POWELL BENV

5

reworked alluvial and colluvial materials. These sands and
sandy loams occupy positions along the drainage edge and
below the valley margins. The terraces have developed from
both colluvium derived from adjacent, raised slopes and alluvium deposited during periods of peak discharge of varying
frequency and magnitude. References to terraces pertain primarily to depositional features at streamside locations and
are distinguished from erosional features at lateral positions
of the slope drainage;
the latter are characterized by
exposures of clay substrate and gravel deposits incised by
drainages of the valley margins.
Flood plains fringe the present channels of the upland
drainages and consist of recent alluvium. These may be
subject to periodic flooding. Generally formed in narrow
strips in the eastern and central portions of the study area,
the flood plain broadens considerably on the western section
of the prospect as one approaches Big Sandy Creek.
Other terrain features noted throughout the eastern
sector of the prospect deserve mention. Although not considered "natural" features, numerous depressions and concavities were frequently observed on the middle and lower valley
margins and near the head of drainages. The dimensions and
character of these features may vary. Some are bowl-shaped
depressions while others are straight-walled holes, each
ranging from 1 to 7 m. across and as much as 4 m. deep. A
remnant of historic shaft mining operations, these features
are surface expressions of collapsing tunnels and ground subsidence which continue to the present.
Soil and Vegetation
Soil development is a function of interacting factors
of climate, vegetation and parent material. Local variation
in soil attributes is further influenced by changes in the
erosional topography and history of land use. Soils information for this report is largely derived from the published
Soil Conservation Service (SCS) soil survey for Bastrop County
(Baker 1979) which provides an overview of the principal soil
factors. Nomenclature of master horizons described in this
report, where presumed applicable, are extrapolated from profile descriptions provided in the published soil survey.
The major soil types represented in the Powell Bend
Prospect can be examined in relation to the landscape features.
Upland soils of slopes and crests are by far the dominant
soils represented. These are chiefly of the Axtell and Crockett series, formed in clayey sediments. These soils are
found in gently to strongly sloping areas and are characterized
by thin surface loams overlying mottled clays. The hazard of
erosion of these soils is relatively high, particularly in
areas of 10 to 12 percent slopes.

LOCATION ANV SETTING

6

Both Axtell and Crockett soils belong to the fine,
montmorillontic, thermic family of Udertic Paleustalfs (Baker
1979), reddish Alfisols of warm sub-humid regions.
These
soils possess an argillic (illuviated clay) horizon and share
properties with Vertisols. Deep, wide cracks may develop
intermittently during most years, which induces mixing.
Along drainageways and toeslopes, soils of the Demona
Series and Demona variant commonly occur as terrace fill,
principally on the western sector of the study area. These
soils generally consist of deep surface horizons of loamy
fine sand from 50 cm. to 1 m. thick overlying a mottled sandy
clay substrate. Formed of the basal sands and sandy clays,
these surface soils are moderately well-drained and subject
to only slight to moderate erosional hazard. Belonging to
the subgroup of Paleustalfs, these soils differ in their
relative lack of shrink-swell tendency and duration of
saturation of mottled horizons.
In the far western sector of the Prospect, considerable
variation in upland soil factors is exhibited by the Patilo
Series. The surface horizon is a deep, fine sand extending
over 1 m. in depth and overlies an argillic horizon of sandy
clay loam. These soils formed in thick, sandy and loamy
material are moderately well drained and, even in steeply
sloping areas, are subject to only slight erosional hazard.
The billowy nature of these deposits suggests some reworking
by wind during the late Pleistocene (Soil Survey Staff 1975).
Minor occurences of other associated and competing soil
types are exhibited on varied features of the topography.
Within the uplands, soils of the Tabor series are locally
prominent, while the Sayers Series is represented in flood
plains and streamside locations.
Vegetation
The region is classed within the central sector of the
Texas Biotic Province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943). Vegetation of
the area is generally represented by woody dominants on the
lower valley margins and along drainages. Tharp (1939) recognized the area as oak-hickory (Que~cu~-Ca~ya) altough this
association is not well represented in the study area. Woodland vegetation in the prospect is largely characterized by
post oak (Que~cu~ ~tellata), yaupon (Ilex vomlto~la), and
some red cedar ( Junlµe~u~ vlnglnlana). Rangeland and agricultural development ;1ave largely replaced upland areas with
range species, low woody scrub such as mesquite (P~o~opl~ sp.)
and herbaceous annuals.

Water Resources
Ground water resources pertinent to the area studied
are principally supplied by the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer
(Mount and others 1976). Although considered of primary
importance over most of the Gulf Coastal Plain, the aquifer
is classified as secondary in the Colorado River basin due to
its limited areal extent.
Outcropping in a broad band throughout a large part of
Bastrop County, the aquifer consists of clay and recharge
sands cemented with iron in its upper reaches. Of the three
major formations of the Wilcox, the Simsboro aquifer is the
most important and productive aquifer underlying the general
area of this investigation (Bureau of Land Management 1980).
This water-bearing unit consists of fine to medium grained
sands and supplies water to industrial and municipal wells in
the area. Natural discharge from the aquifer is in the form
of subsurface leakage, springs and seep activity along the
courses of principal surface drainages (Mount and others 1976).
No springs or active discharge were observed within drainages
of the Powell Bend Prospect during the period of this study.
All of the surface drainage in the study area is part
of the Colorado River system. Flowing west to east across
the central portion of Bastrop County, the Colorado is the
principal water source into which the upland watersheds ultimately flow.
Within the Powell Bend Prospect all the surface drainages
constitute part of the Big Sandy Creek watershed, a primary
tributary flowing directly into the Colorado River. For
ease of reference, the mainstream Colorado may be regarded as
first order, Big Sandy Creek as second order, and ascendent
source drainages designated as streams of increasing rank
order. In this system most of the unnamed drainages occurring
within the study area are ranked as third, fourth and fifth
order streams.
One principal channel drains east to west across the
central (mining zone) and western sector of the Prospect.
This unnamed, third order watercourse receives runoff from
tributaries draining the slopes and valley margins. Generally,
the higher order drainages are abrading streams which have
eroded upland surfaces and degraded the valley margin slopes.
Additionally, terraces and aggrading surfaces are usually
found along the third order drainages. Surface water availability within the prospect watershed is limited. Flow is
only intermittent with water standing in shallow, depressed
pools at irregular intervals within the channel of the third
order drainage.

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEDURES
Prior to the field work, archival research was conducted for known sites in the Powell Bend Prospect. A
search of site files at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin, found
no known sites within the study area.
Field reconnaissance of the Powell Bend Prospect was
conducted to orient the crew to features of landscape, factors
affecting site recognition, and the general potential of
site presence and distribution. Commonality between these
variables and those encountered in the study of the adjacent
Camp Swift area (Skelton and Freeman 1979) prompted a similar
field strategy.
In accordance with the LCRA's need for immediate inventory and assessment of any cultural sites within the mining
zone, field inspections were initiated in that 400-acre area.
Evaluations of sites located within the mining zone were provided to the LCRA in an interim report which included recommendations for further investigation at selected sites.
Field procedures pertinent to these investigations are detailed in the test excavation section of this report (See p.
65). After providing location, evaluation and recommendations
for the mining zone sites, intensive survey of the additional
800-acre construction area was begun. Field survey procedures
followed the same logistical framework throughout.
Intensive survey was achieved by dividing the study
area into separate survey units, utilizing fence rows,
drainages, treelines and roadways as boundary markers.
Coverage of the individual units was accomplished by transects
walked in meandering fashion at intervals of thirty to forty
meters, depending on the character of the vegetation and
surface visibility. Narrower intervals were generally maintained within heavy brushlands and areas of heavy ground cover;
intervals were adjusted to allow visual overlap and inspection
of all ground surface. In most cases, sites were initially
indicated by cultural materials exposed in open fields, ranch/
access roads cut through dense woodlands, drainage banks,
animal burrows and erosional exposures of upland terrain.
Subsequently, efforts to define the nature of the cultural
area and/or delimit vertical and horizontal site perimeters
were augmented by a combination of surface inspection and extensive subsurface shovel probes. All soil matrices from the
probes were screened through box screens with one/fourth
inch mesh.
Site documentation utilized standard University of
Texas site survey forms. Generally, qualitative assessments
of the site's attributes, including horizontal and vertical
extents, artifact distributions and contexts, and associations
of cultural materials are recorded. The sites were assigned
temporary field numbers and the locations and horizontal

POWELL BENV

9

extents were plotted on 1:12,000 aerial photo mosaics and
topographic quadrangle maps of the study area provided by
the LCRA.
Materials collected during the survey were generally
limited to the few diagnostic artifacts located on the sites.
These, and site documentation, are housed at TARL, the central repository for site information in the state, where all
sites located in the survey were assigned permanent numbers
following the trinomial system of site nomenclature. In this
system the first two digits signify the state (41=Texas),
the two letters designate the county (BP=Bastrop County),
and the last numbers represent the order in which the site
was registered for that county (240=site). Thus, 41BP240
indicates the two hundred-fortieth site recorded in Bastrop
County, Texas.

10

RESULTS OF THE SURVEY
The archeological investigations were designed to
locate and evaluate cultural sites. The concept of "site"
refers to any locus exhibiting physical manifestations or
residues of past human activity. The residues found on
these sites can be considered only a partial record of prehistoric peoples and their activities. Many artifacts are
destroyed by adverse environmental conditions. Durable,
resistant material - mostly stone - found in preliminary
investigation of a site is assumed to reflect this differential preservation which results in only a partial perspective of prehistoric cultural activity.
Thirty sites with prehistoric components were identified
in the survey of the Powell Bend Prospect (Fig. 2). Fifteen
of these occur wholly or predominantly within the boundaries
of the mining zone and the remaining fifteen are in the adjacent 800-acre construction area. Most were initially indicated by artifacts visible in areas of local surface exposure
or erosional features.
Intensive surface inspections and
shovel probes overcame problems of concealment by dense
ground cover and leaf litter. Given the restricted procedural
framework of surface inspection and limited subsurface probes,
it is difficult to assign sites to specific functional catagories. However, based on observed records of cultural
materials found on these sites and their locations over the
varied landscape, general categories of site tvue and their
terrain distributions can be discerned.
General site types recognized were quarries, lithic
scatters, lithic/burned rock scatters, and isolated finds.
These types are defined principally by the artifact classes
occurring there, the spatial confinement of these artifacts,
and their association to naturally-occurring features. Although some general implications concerning function are
suggested by the site type categories, these must be viewed
as tentative and alluding to only a few of possible activities.
Quarries
Quarry sites are indicated by the surface occurrence of
cores, core remnants and primary reduction debris in association with large accumulations or deposits of unmodified
gravel cobbles. Generally, chert cobbles are the principal
source materials. These sites are indicative of aboriginal
efforts to procure materials suitable for subsequent reduction
in manufacturing stone tools.
Six quarry sites, representing 20 percent of all prehistoric sites in the study area, were identified. Most of
these lithic procurement areas are found in association with
exposures of large gravel cobbles on upland summits and the
upper valley margins. One was situated on a low-lying slope

RESULTS OF THE SURVEY

projection scoured of alluvial sediments and heavily laden
with surface gravels.
Lithic Scatters
Lithic scatters consist of surface and subsurface
clusters of cores, core remnants and secondary and tertiary
chert flakes and chips where no associated source of suitable
raw material is evident or where the flakes are distinctly
confined to areas apart from local gravel sources. These
sites usually indicate several activities including secondary
reduction in tool manufacture, stone tool maintenance or
processing of faunal or vegetal matter (dependent on usewear flakes or tools).
Eight lithic scatters (27 percent of the total) were
found in the study area. Most of these occurred in the upper
valley margins and consisted of secondary and tertiary chert
flakes. These scatters were isolated from visible sources
of local cobbles and two sites (41BP243 and 244) were situated
on sandy upper valley margin deposits near the confluence
of Sandy Creek and a major tributary.
Lithic/Burned Rock Scatters
These scatters are characterized by the co-occurrence
of chert debitage, cores, and fire-fractured rock. As with
lithic scatters, much of the debitage consists of secondary
and tertiary chert flakes and chips. In upland environments
at a considerable distance from a major river flood plain,
such sites usually represent short-term encampments suggesting intermittent exploitation of upland resources.
Thirteen sites, 43 percent of the total, are included
in this category. They were found in widely different terrains including terraces, valley margins and sandy upland
deposits. Within the limited interpretive scope of this survey, it is undeterminable whether the wide distribution of
these sites suggests selective exploitation of resources
associated with these landforms, a homogeneity of preference
and distribution of resources sought, or is derived from
the simplified system of classification used for these sites.
Isolated Finds
The final category of site type is the isolated artifact find - a single prehistoric lithic artifact lacking
cultural context. Three were recorded in this survey. Information gained from such sites is limited; some, however, can
be inferred from the nature of the artifacts and/or environmental contexts. The basal fragment of an En~o~ or Ma~eo~­
like dart point found at 41BP250 indicates Late Archaic
hunting activity; the core biface at 41BP241 was found in a
deposit of naturally-occurring gravels suggesting lithic
procurement and/or reduction.

TERRAIN DISTRIBUTIONS
The prehistoric sites recorded on this survey of upland
areas of the Colorado River basin are distributed over four
topographic zones and variant features of these zones:
valley margins, terraces, upland divides and sandy upland
deposits. Fifteen prehistoric sites (50 percent of the total)
were located on valley margins where erosion of surface soils
is common. Ten lithic or lithic/burned rock scatters, the
majority of the quarry sites (four of six), and one isolated
find were situated on the degraded upper valley margins,
eroded lower slopes and gravelly slope projections. Within
the area of this study, sites on these terrain features have
been detrimentally affected by erosional processes. This is
attributable to both slope grades and to the numerous fourth
and fifth order tributaries draining the divides and valley
margins.
Four lithic/burned rock scatters and one lithic scatter
were located on the terrace features developed along the
course of the third order drainage, the mainstem stream
flowing within the confines of the study area. The terraces
are aggrading surfaces formed of alluvial and colluvial
sediments.
The upland divides, generally represented by level-to-convex degraded surfaces, are a prime source of gravel cobbles.
As do the valley margins, the divides exhibit lag deposits
suitable for cobble procurement. Two quarry sites were located on the divides, as well as one lithic scatter and an
isolated find.
Deep sandy deposits are found near the course of Big
Sandy Creek on the far western sector of the Powell Bend
Prospect. These deep deposits are on both upland divides
and valley margins and are considered a variant feature of
the basic landforms. Five lithic or lithic/burned rock
scatters and one isolated find were situated on these deposits, which may have formed as old, high terraces of Sandy
Creek, as aeolian features, or as an outcrop of the local
Simsboro geology. The burned rock and debitage observed on
these sites suggest short-term habitations.
Most sites on these sandy upland deposits have been
disturbed by past clearing and ranching, or agricultural
developments. This has also occurred in many sites located
on alluvial terraces and, where slope is less severe, on
small depositional features along the valley margins. These
sandy areas are also favorable habitats for rodents and
burrowing is extensive.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The cultural prehistory of Bastrop County is known from
residues of thousands of years of aboriginal exploitation.
The material remains of prehistoric sites in this county
generally indicate a developmental sequence associated with
the Central Texas archeological region, a broadly-defined
region encompassing areas of the coastal Plain, the Eastern
Woodlands, and the Edwards Plateau. An outline of regional
prehistory of this cultural-geographic unit was provided by
Skelton and Freeman (1979) in work at Camp Swift and need not
be repeated here. The brief overview of the prehistoric
cultural sequence presented has strong parallels in Central
Texas, thus, in the absence of local radiocarbon assays,,
dates are extrapolated from Central Texas. The cultural
chronology of the Central Texas region is organized into four
general periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric and
Historic. Salient characteristics of the sequence are provided.
Paleoindian Period (? - ea. 8000 B.P.)
Although cultural constructs are not well understood
for the study area, Paleoindian peoples may have hunted big
game in West Texas and the Plains. Numerous early lanceolatetype projectile point styles attest to the Paleoindian
presence in Central Texas, but lack of sites with directly
associated Late Pleistocene artifacts and remains of megafauna may indicate a more generalized hunting and gathering
(Archaic stage) economy (Bryant and Shafer 1977).
Archaic Period (ea. 8000 - 1250 B.P.)
Developed through local adaptations to the changing
post-Pleistocene environment, this period spans the largest
segment of the cultural prehistory and has been refined to
six sequential phases of cultural development (Table 1). The
period is characterized by strong foraging and hunting traditions adapted to local ecological conditions (Prewitt 1974;
Weir 1976). Most immediate to the study area, Archaic components have been found in prehistoric sites investigated in
the Camp Swift area (Skelton and Freeman 1979) (Fig. 1).
Late Prehistoric Period (ea. 1250 B.P. - European contact)
This period is marked by technological innovations and
change. Diagnostics include the bow and arrow, the first

pottery, and the development of agriculture, although the
latter phenonmenon is more applicable in other parts of the
state than in the study area. Prehistoric manifestations in
Central Texas are designated as the Central Texas Aspect and
are divided into two foci, the earlier Austin Focus and the
Toyah Focus.
Historic Period (European contact - present)
The Tonkawa were the principal inhabitants of the
Central Texas area at the time of European contact (Newcomb
1961). Later intrusive groups, such as the Commanche,
entered from the north. Only two excavated sites in Central
Texas are associated with historic Indian occupation - the
Stansbury Site (Stephenson 1970) and the San Xavier Missions
(Gilmore 1969).
With the arrival and expansion of European groups, the
native populations were gradually displaced.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

PREVIOUS LOCAL RESEARCH
Archeological research in the area has been by several
reconnaissance level surveys in portions of Bastrop County;
few intensive, systematic investigations have been undertaken.
The earliest work in the area was a survey along the central
Colorado River in Travis, Bastrop and Fayette counties (Wilson 1930). Although site documentation was somewhat scanty,
Wilson's survey provided a first approximation of cultural
resource.s in the County. Other early work consisted of
sporadic, isolated site recordings, surveys, and intermittent
excavation by amateur or professional archeologists. In
1953 T.B. Campbell and E.R. Jelks, both of The University of
Texas Department of Anthropology, excavated at 41BP1, the
Goodwin site (Skelton and Freeman 1979: 21). Skeletal remains exposed in this Late Prehistoric burial were associated
with ceramics and projectile points.
The University of Texas Anthropological Society began
to record and test sites in the area between 1962 and 1968,
documenting seventeen sites during that time. Most notable
was the McCormick site (41BP3), where two burials were found
with Late Prehistoric materials (Davis 1964). The Society
also documented the Pease site (41BP51), reporting both
Archaic and Paleoindian materials. Other work conducted by
the Society included survey and testing of sites near the
Powell Bend Prospect along the course of Big Sandy Creek.
One Late Prehistoric campsite (41BP55) was located about onehalf mile south-southeast of Sayersville where excavations
recovered a small number of flakes and burned rocks, a single
sherd of Leon Plain pottery, and a Pe~diz arrowpoint (Brown
1966). Although their cultural affiliations were undetermined,
three surface sites, two lithic burned rock scatters (41BP56
and 58), and one quarry/lithic reduction area (41BP57) were
recorded on the terraces of Big Sandy Creek west of the
present study area (Clark 1966).
More recently, an archeological survey conducted near
Smithville located the Lake Thunderbird site (41BP78), an
extensive lithic concentration of chert cobbles, cores and
debitage (Duke 1977). Diagnostic artifacts indicate that the
site was utilized during the Paleoindian and Late Prehistoric
periods. In the southern sector of the county, a number of
sites were recorded in upland environs along drainage terraces
and gravelly cuestas (Kenmotsu and Freeman 1980). One terrace
site (41BP176) was subsequently tested, revealing possible
Terminal Late Prehistoric occupation and stone tool maintenance activity (Brown and Kenmotsu 1980).
The north-central portion of the county has been the
most systematically investigated. The Texas Archeological
Survey carried out a survey of 160 acres for the proposed
development of the Federal Youth Center (Fawcett 1975). One
extensive lithic scatter was recorded but no diagnostic
artifacts were found. A 4,000 acre tract on the Camp Swift

POWELL BENV

17

Military Reservation has also been under investigation.
Following a reconnaissance survey of limited scope (Dibble
1976), the Texas Archeological Survey conducted a program
of intensive survey and limited testing at Camp Swift (Skelton and Freeman 1979). Forty-two prehistoric sites and
forty-three historic sites were recorded in this upland
environment and eight of the prehistoric sites eva1uated
through test excavation. Information from all these sites
forms a valuable base of knowledge of regional aboriginal
and early historic cultural patterns and provides a methodological and comparative outline for the present study.

18

SUMMARY OF RESOURCES
Prehistoric Resources
During this survey thirty prehistoric sites and sites
having prehistoric components were identified - fifteen wholly
or predominantly within the boundaries of the mining zone
and fifteen in the adjacent 800-acre construction area.
Based on surficially-exposed cultural residues, four general
types of sites were recorded: quarry sites - 6 (20% of the
total), lithic scatters - 8 (27%), lithic/burned rock scatters
- 13 (43%), and 3 isolated finds.
The major terrain features recognized in the uplands
of the Colorado River basin are terraces, valley margins,
upland divides and flood plains. Cultural sites were found
on all of these landforms except flood plains. As found at
the adjacent Camp Swift area (Skelton and Freeman 1979: 29),
the majority were associated with valley margins. In the
study area fifteen were located on the valley margins: four
lithic scatters, six lithic/burned rock scatters, four quarry
sites and one isolated find. Five sites (one lithic scatter
and four lithic/burned rock scatters) were situated on
terraces developed along the main channel flowing through
the Prospect. Four (two quarries, one lithic scatter and
one isolated find) were on the upland interfluvial divides.
Six sites (two lithic scatters, three lithic/burned rock
scatters and one isolated find) occurred in sandy deposits
of variant upland features found on the western sector of the
Prospect near Big Sandy Creek. Whether due to their absence
or concealment by surface accretion, no sites were found in
the active flood plains.
General trends in site preservation seem related to the
topographic position and patterns of land use. Within the
mining zone and throughout the major portion of the construction area, sites found on the sloping, gravel-strewn
upland divides and valley margins are largely eroded, lack
depth to their cultural deposits, and retain little or no
structural integrity. In addition to natural processes, agricultural practices such as land clearing and development of
pasturage, as well as activities related to historic mining,
have resulted in substantial site deterioration in the
project area. Terrace sites generally demonstrate better
potential for retaining intact subsurface cultural components.
Even with rodent burrowing and land modification, the aggrading surfaces and depth of sediments increase the possibility for deeply buried discrete cultural deposits.
Various categories of site types and their relationships to landscape are provided for descriptive classification
and simplicity and brevity of presentation (Table 2). Cultural activity within the study area may be manifested by a

POWELL BENV

diversity of artifact types and encompass various physiographic/resource zones reflecting multiple site activities
and multiple use of resources. A comprehensive view and
explanation of these activities can be obtained only through
intensive investigation of select sites. One goal of this
study has been the assessment of a site's interpretive potential for these explanations. Sites located and examined
during this investigation have been assessed with respect to
proposed mining and mining-related land use objectives. The
primary area of direct lignite extraction covers 400 acres
and cultural sites within this zone were considered unavoidably subject to destruction.
Based on the surface assessments of the cultural
sites occurring within the mining zone, four sites (all prehistoric) were considered to warrant evaluative testing.
Three of these (41BP191, 218, and 229) occupy sandy alluvial
terraces; one (41BP192) is situated on the valley margins.
The sites demonstrated cultural depth in shovel probes,
variability in their artifact assemblages, and/or cultural
features. Burned rock concentrations/hearths were exposed
in erosional features at 41BP192 and 218. Because of their
probable subsurface integrity and, thus, their potential
value for understanding upland-based encampments, systematic
subsurface testing was recommended at all four sites. The
nature and findings of the testing program are provided in
Appendix I of this report.

SUMMARY OF RESOURCES

Historic Resources
During the course of investigations in the Powell Bend
Prospect, equal effort was exerted to locate and identify
sites related to historic activity. Although agricultural
and ranching economies have been pursued in the vicinity of
the Prospect, the vast majority of the extant historic remains
and cultural landscape features encountered were those associated with historic lignite mining operations. Due to the
extent of existing mining-related sites in the survey area,
study was oriented to this period of local history.
Numerous historic treatments of Bastrop County either
exclude or only cursorily mention this period of activity in
the county. Previous studies related to the industrial history of the state are few. Betancourt (1977), conducted a
study for the Texas Historical Commission and wrote an insightful review of lignite mining at Rockdale (and Milam
County), providing an excellent format for investigation
which has been followed in this report. Some of this material
is adapted from Betancourt but in all cases the primary
sources were consulted and provided the information base
for statements made.
To provide a framework in which to view the historic
mining activity evidenced in the Powell Bend Prospect, an
overview of lignite use, early perspectives on potential
lignite development and a general background to the mining
industry in Texas and Bastrop Couny are presented. A brief
review of historic activities prior to the introduction of
mining operations to the Powell Bend vicinity is first provided. A general pattern of land use centering on agriculture and cattle raising is evident but no period in intensive early settlement emerges.
Ethnohistory and Early Settlement
The history of this area, like that of most of North
America, begins with European exploration. At the time of
Spanish contact, the central Texas area was inhabited by
bands of presumably indigenous groups. The seminomadic
Tonkawa occupied the eastern and southern part of the central
Texas area (Suhm 1960: 64). Under pressure from intrusive
Apache and Commanche groups and increases in European expansion, surviving remnants of diverse groups united to form
the Tonkawa tribe (Newcomb 1961: 134) but with the advent of
Anglo settlement they too were doomed to expulsion and
extinction.
Early European expeditions following the Camino Real
encountered other aboriginal groups such as the Tejas Indians
and the Yojuane, a group of the Tonkawa tribe (Casteneda
1936: II:22-23). Freeman, in her review of early travel
through Bastrop County, mentions several expeditions encountering Indian groups at the crossing of the Colorado
River between the late seventeenth and early nineteenth

POWELL BENV

23

centuries (Skelton and Freeman 1979: 85-87).
Early Anglo settlement of most of Bastrop County and
of the present Powell Bend Prospect was initiated through
the efforts of Stephen F. Austin. In 1827 Austin was
granted a contract by the Imperial Government of Mexico
which called for the settlement of one hundred families east
of the Colorado River. This became known as the "Little
Colony" and included the area of present-day Bastrop County.
Occupation and Land Use in the Prospect
It is not clear exactly when initial settlement took
place in the are of this study. Pointing out the paucity
of early settlement in the Camp Swift area (northeast of the
Powell Bend Prospect), Freeman stressed the constant threat
posed by roaming bands of Indians as a deterrent (Skelton
and Freeman 1979: 88-89). The study area encompasses portions
of both the Leman Barker and Issac Harris land grants and
these, however, do appear to have been settled early and
marginally developed.
Barker was among the first installment of colonists to
settle in the "Little Colony" which experienced in-migration
beginning perhaps as early as 1827 or 1828 (Ray 1970: 304).
Accompanying the Barker family to the Bastrop (then the
"Mina") area, Josiah Pugh Wilbarger and his wife, Margaret
(Barker's daughter), settled on a league of land which had
been granted to Wilbarger. They arrived in Texas December
26, 1827 living for about a year at Matagorda and then at
LaGrange for a time before moving to the Bastrop area (Webb
1952: II:908). Aware of the threat of hostile Indian groups,
Wilbarger erected a blockhouse and stockade immediately upon
arrival at his headright (Jones 1936: 8).
According to tax records, Leman Barker had acquired
two slaves by 1838, presumably to assist in farm work (Texas
Archives of the Comptrollers Office 1838). By 1840 Isaac
Harris had sold much of his league and had begun agricultural
and cattle raising activities on a minor scale (White 1966).
Several notable individuals had acquired portions of
these grants by the 1850's: Thomas J. Hardeman, Gail Borden,
Jr., and L.C. Cunningham. Of these, Hardeman may have been
the only one to have settled on and worked the fourth of the
Harris league he had purchased in 1841 (Bastrop County clerk
1841). Having served in the Congress of the Republic and the
Legislature of Texas (Moore 1977: 208), Hardeman, by 1850, .
had established a successful farming operation which included
300 acres of improved field, several hundred dollars in
machinery and implements, livestock, high yield in a variety
of row crops, and 1176 unimproved acres of property (United
States Bureau of the Census 1850).
Gail Borden, Jr., perhaps best known as an inventor
for his process for condensing milk in vacuum, was an early
landowner in the Bastrop area. Soon after his arrival in

24

SUMMARY OF RESOURCES

Texas in 1829 he succeeded his brother Thomas as official
surveyor for the Stephen F. Austin colony and in the early
1830's he acquired 500 acres from Isaac Harris (Bastrop County
clerk 1832). Part of Borden's acreage overlaps the southern
portion of the present study area. During the period in
which he owned this land, Borden pursued numerous ventures
in other parts of the Republic, including newspaper publishing,
a term as first collector in the port of Galveston, land
agent and inventor (Webb 1952: 189). Although he did establish a sawmill in Bastrop after the Civil War, his interest
may have been that of land speculation and it is unlikely
that he ever settled on his Bastrop land.
Leander C. Cunningham, who fought in the battle of
San Jacinto, purchased about 1,000 acres of the Barker
tract in 1853 (Bastrop County Clerk 1853). Part of this
purchase is the western portion of the present study area.
Cunningham practiced law and served as Chief Justice in
Bastrop County (Webb 1952: 446) and was a prominent merchant
in Bastrop (Moore 1977: 203). Although he was active in
agriculture and cattle raising activities (United States
Bureau of the Census 1860), his period of ownership of the
Barker land was short implying that his major farming activities were on other of his land tracts (Texas Archives of
the Comptrollers Office 1863).
Other than farming and ranching, one industry important
to the early Bastrop economy was lumbering. Bastrop became
a center of lumber mills and furnished materials to much of
west and central Texas. Portions of the study area within
the Harris league were owned by a mill company in the 1850's
(Bastrop County Clerk 1857, deed book No. 12, p. 463) and
may have provided the timber to a sawmill operated by A.M.
Brooks near Sayersville (Jones 1936: 19).
Following the Civil War and up to the 1900's, land
ownership of the various tracts comprising the Powell Bend
Prospect was somewhat short term - land speculation may have
been the motivation. Nonetheless, agriculture and ranching,
whether by resident owners or lessors, was the dominant land
use activity until the advent of the historic lignite industry.
Overview of Lignite Mining
In order to fully grasp the role of the lignite coal
industry in Texas and Bastrop County, summaries of the characteristics, distribution, and uses of lignite are presented.
A brief examination of the early mining technologies and
methods of extraction provides an indication of the difficult
task confronting the early miners. Emphasizing Texas in
general, and Bastrop County in particular, this report includes an historic context and sketches past mining activity
in the Powell Bend Prospect.

POWELL BENO

25

Distribution and Characteristics of Lignite
Texas lignites occur as sedimentary deposits in several
geological formations of the State. The most extensive of
these deposits occurs in the Wilcox Group, a geological unit
extending in an elongated band from Bowie and Rains counties
of northeast Texas, through Milam and Bastrop counties of
central Texas, and to Webb and Maverick counties on the Rio
Grande (Henry and Basciano 1979: 1). Higher quality lignites
are generally restricted to the deposits extending from northeast Texas to just south of the Colorado River below Bastrop
County. Eight billion tons of lignite are estimated to be
contained within this section of the Wilcox (Kaiser 1978: 4).
Given such a large reserve, it is easy to understand why
Texas was historically considered to have an unlimited supply
of this resource and to contain "the greatest lignite and
brown coal deposits in the United States" (Everett 1917).
In Texas, there are two forms of coal, bituminous coal
and lignite, with some variation within these classes. Lignite, sometimes termed brown-coal, represents an early stage
of coal formation. Simply, coals are formed by biochemical
and physical processes acting on accumulated plant material.
The different ranks of coal are dependent upon the nature and
composition of the original plant materials and the duration
and character of the geological processes acting upon these
raw materials. The different ranks are classified on an
ascending continuum reflecting the increased magnitude of
intensity and the duration of the geological processes. This
ranking, simply, is: peat-lignite-bituminous coal-anthracite.
These are distinguished primarily by differences in texture,
petrographic and chemical composition and caloric value
(Fisher 1963: 2).
Compared to the higher ranked coals, lignite as a fuel
has a low caloric (heat) value, high moisture content, and
relatively high ash and sulfur contents. Its high moisture
content affects the caloric value. Lignite, in its asreceived or sun-dried bases, is chemically combined with the
moisture and must be decomposed or burned to remove the
moisture. Much of the heating power of the fuel is lost in
the evaporation process, giving rise to an historically oftused saying that "lignite burns without heating" (Penrose
1889: 97).
Contributing to this early dissatisfaction with lignite
was the strong tendency of lignite to "slack" when exposed
to air. Considerable wastage of fuel was due to crumbling
particles flying up the furnace flues, difficulty of handling
in a furnace, and transportation limitations. Many of the
problems, however, were due to the lack of appropriate
technology.
Uses of Lignite
The four principal methods of utilizing lignite are:
1) fuel under stationary boilers; 2) fuel in gas producers;

26

SUMMARY OF RESOURCES

3) briquetting raw or dry lignite to improve its efficiency
as a fuel; and 4) dry distillation and recovery of byproducts. Until 1913 lignite use in Texas was largely restricted to the first two (Phillips and Worrell 1913: 112).
Its main value as fuel for generating steam under the stationary boilers; it was less successful for locomotive
boilers. When Texas lignite production became sufficient
for its demands, railroads quickly found it inferior to coal
brought from other states and seldom used this local fuel
(Henderson 1964). Before 1920, lignite was the predominant
boiler fuel for powering cotton gins, compresses, and other
stream-driven plants in Texas (Betancourt 1977: 64). Almost
all of Texas lignite mine output was consumed within the
state and by the mid-1920's lignite had found a foothold in
industries requiring power plants, and in municipal power
and waterworks plants (The Dallas News 1925: 143).
Another important lignite use in Texas was its conversion to gas through specially designed producers. Burned
in fireboxes, gases produced in burning are carried by conduits serving to condense and separate the tarry by-products.
The remaining fixed gases are passed directly to furnaces
or through a regenerative furnace (Dumble 1892: xxxviii).
Under the ordinary steam boiler plant this producer gas was twice
as efficient as lignite. The first commercial use of lignite
in this way was at the Southwestern Portland Cement Company
of Dallas (Galveston-Dallas News 1910: 66). The predominant
use of this gas fuel was for power generation through
specially designed engines at local power plants and waterworks, although it has other uses, such as lime burning.
As many as 56 producers had been installed in Texas by 1911,
including one at the Smithville Light and Power Company in
Bastrop County which procured its lignite from the mines of
the Independence Mining Company, Phelan, located just north
of the town of Bastrop (Phillips, Worrell and Phillips
1911: 116).
The other two methods of lignite use previously mentioned, briquetting and the distillation and recovery of byproducts, received only limited application in Texas although
the potential certainly existed. A well-developed and widely
practiced technology had grown in Europe which maximized the
use of relatively inferior brown coal in its raw state (Dumble
1890: 59). In addition to the technological impetus, the
Europeans had developed an efficient means of manufacturing
coal bricks, or briquettes. Pulverizing the lignites,
evaporating surplus water, and compression under pressure,
produced an improved form of this solid fuel. The briquettes
could better withstand transport over larger distances and
storage over longer periods. Such bricks had long been used
on French and Belgian railroads and for other purposes (Penrose 1889: 98). Attempts at briquetting lignite in Texas
were largely unsuccessful as a commercial endeavor. Although
plans had been initiated for this industry in Milam County,

POWELL BENV

27

they were abandoned in 1910 (Bentancourt 1977: 66).
The recovery and processing of valuable by-products
was another potential use of Texas lignites. As above,
Europeans had long established, successful commercial enterprises in the retorting of lignite. Through their processes, by-products such as ammonia, cresol, anthracene, and
tar oil could be recovered in the briquetting process (The
Dallas News 1925: 143). In 1922, activated carbon was
manufactured from Texas lignite at the Darco Corporation
plant in Marshall. Activated carbon is used as a clarifier
in manufacturing processes such as sugar-making, water treatment and gas absorption (Fisher 1963: 23).
In sum, the uses of lignite are varied. It is particularly valuable in most chemical and industrial processes
requiring carbon or carbon compounds. The possibilities
for Texas lignite have never been fully realized.
Early History in Texas
The earliest evidence for the use of lignite in Texas
is at the prehistoric Lewisville site located near Dallas
on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. At approximately
10,000 B.C. people encamped at this site used lignite for
their fires (Stanford 1981). It is quite possible that throughout the prehistoric period various bands used lignite since
it is exposed along the banks of many Texas watersheds.
The use of lignite for fuel by early Texas settlers
is certainly likely; it was often encountered by settlers
drilling water wells (Gentry 1920). With a cheap and ample
wood supply available, however, lignites would play a
secondary role as a fuel source.
As early as 1819, L.F. L'Heriter indicated a "mivie. de.
c.ha.ttbovi de. .te.ttJte." on an East Texas map accompanying the report
"Le. Cha.mp V'A~ile., ta.ble.a.u .topotJta.phique. e..t hi~toJtique. du
Te.xa.~, e..tc..," published in Paris (Stenzel 1946: 197).
In
1839, J.L. Riddell provided the first definite description
of Texas brown coal:
. . in the banks of the Trinity, associated with
the iron ore, and overlying the brown coal, whole
trees and fragments of trees, piled sometimes one
upon another, present themselves completely trans£ ormed in to stone. . . The col or of the coal is
dark umber brown, nearly black . . . It is readily
ignited, burns with a pleasant flame, and with
almost the same facility as charcoal (Riddell 1839).
Dumble (1892: 18-19) mentions the early observations of Dr.
Francis Moore who reported several localities in his 1840
Ve.~c.ttip.tiovi 06 Te.xa~.
Some of these are large beds of lignite
in the banks of the Colorado a few miles above LaGrange;
others are in the banks of the Brazos and Little Brazos
rivers, and in the Yegua formation about twelve miles from
the town of Independence, Washington County. Although some

28

SUMMARY OF RESOURCES

local small-scale mining had taken place, the deposits were
not explored as a potential fuel industry until the 1880's.
A series of studies by the Texas Geological Survey
was undertaken in the 1880's to identify and evaluate the
industrial potential of Texas' lignite resources. Although
this resource was found in 54 counties, in whole or in part,
lignite mining was reported at only a few places, among them
Bastrop, in Bastrop County (Dumble 1890: xxxviii). The
survey also reported that lignite was already being developed
as a serviceable fuel, particularly in areas of wood scarcity.
Given the expense of bituminous coal, satisfactory results
had been obtained in burning lignites in San Antonio (Dumble
1888: 20). Considerable mining of local coal had occurred
within twenty miles of Laredo, another area of wood scarcity.
The enterprising owner built his own railroad, the "Rio
Grande and Pecos," to carry coal to Laredo and facilitate
shipment to the various markets. The material was used extensively by the Mexican International Railroad for locomotive fuel and for steam and household purposes in Laredo
(Penrose 1889: 96-97).
Recognizing the superior quality of Texas raw lignites
over European coals, these investigators were convinced
of its potential high value and use. Seeking to borrow
advanced technology from Europe where their materials had
been used for fuel, smelting, and distillation derivatives,
they toured factories in Germany, France and a number of
other European industrial areas where they were given much
information and assistance (Dumble 1891: xxxii).
With the accurate evaluation of the extent of lignite
fields in Texas and the viability of its multiple uses
confirmed by tests, the borrowed technology of Europe appeared
to create a positive atmosphere for a burgeoning industry.
The lignite deposits were distributed in a manner convenient
to already constructed railroad lines that could facilitate
transport of mined and processed products. Urging the State
to take full advantage of this vast resource, the late nineteenth century investigators continually recounted the relative
high quality of Texas lignites and the European accomplishments with a lesser quality material (Dumble 1890: 59).
Dr. Otto Lerch (1890), commenting on this European
success and the potential advantages of superior Texas lig-.
nites, state:
Not withstanding their (European lignites) inferiority, notwithstanding the near vicinity of
extensive coal fields containing the very best
stone coal, and not withstanding that the most of
them can be obtained only by deep mining, that
immense forest tracts are cultivated with the
utmost care, that almost every tree is replanted
as quickly as removed, millions of dollars have
been advantageously invested in Europena lignites.

POWELL BENV

29

Their manufacture sustains a large and skilled
population, and exerts the most important influence upon their prosperity and wealth of the
counties in which the coal beds are located .
. . . There is no risk to take, the experience
of Europe is at (our) command.
Although the subsequent development of the historic
mining industry in Texas may be considered, at least partially,
a response to these words, unfortunately, the response of the
mining industry did not include what Lerch perceived as
European stewardship toward land and forest. Too often
remnants of the historic mining activity in Texas are torn
landscapes and subsidence features from collapsed and abandoned tunnels. Shafts and tunnels continue to cave in today
making the land both denuded and dangerous. Present rangeland occupying former mine sites must be continually monitored;
deep, surface depressions and sinkholes appear routinely
and must be filled since cattle are sometimes lost in these
features (Gould; personal communication).
Early Production in Texas
Contributing to this historic industrial episode, over
150 operators were involved in the lignite industry in at
least 35 counties (Kaiser 1974: 29). Annual production
figures vary, but indicate a few general trends in relative
production (Dallas Morning News 1939-40: 223; Railroad Commission of Texas 1981; Bullock 1928). Separate records for
lignite were not maintained prior to 1895 although a cumulative total for bituminous coal and lignite production was
kept through the 1880's.
Prior to 1900, production of lignite was minor, totaling
less than 200,000 tons annually. This was largely a result
of the general unpopularity of lignite, its inherent inferior qualities as a fuel and the lack of appropriatelyadapted technology. Although lignite was in limited, almost
experimental, use, major competition from traditional fuel
sources precluded widespread adoption of lignite. In heavily
wooded areas, such as parts of east-central Texas, lignite
was abundant and easily mined but both pines and hardwoods
were as readily available. In such areas, this availability
contributed to the widespread use of wood for all household
and steam-making purposes (Dumble 1892: 18-19). Stoves and
furnaces were adapted for wood or bituminous coal and did
not heat well with lignite. Additionally, in some areas,
railroads could have wood placed along the track for as little
as $2.00 to $4.00 a cord (Penrose 1889:97). Faced with
stiff price competition, it is remarkable that lignite developed as a fuel source at all. The scarcity of wood in
many regions and the steady depletion of wood resources
throughout Texas, however, assured the slow but steady growth
of the ligite industry in its early years.

30

SUMMARY OF RESOURCES

Steadily increasing in yearly output, lignite production prior to 1900 raised a short-lived optimism. In
January of 1901, the "Lucas Gusher" came in at Spindletop
Hill, three miles south of Beaumont. Although other oil
fields had been discovered at Nacogdoches in 1856 and the
Corsicana field had been producing since 1891, the major
strike at Spindletop is credited with giving the oil industry its start (The Galveston-Dallas News Texas Almanac
1904: 149 and 154). The magnitude of production from Spindletop pool helped advance Texas to second among all
petroleum-producing states and swelled the total oil production of the United States beyond that of Russia in 1902.
Providing an incentive for further exploration, this single
discovery prompted an influx of investments for drilling,
refineries, tank steamers, and a host of support industries.
The effect of this find on the lignite industry was
predictable. Feeling the competition of fuel oil much more
rapidly and keenly than bituminous coal operations, many
lignite mines were forced to shut down or considerably reduce
their production. In 1902, in order to meet the competition
from oil, lignite was offered for 50 cents per ton, f.o.b.
mines, the lowest price ever reached in the industry's
short history (Phillips 1902: vi).
This set-back to the lignite industry, severe as it
was, was of relatively short duration. By 1905-1906,
production haJ stabilized in response to increasing oil
prices (Galveston-Dallas News Texas Almanac 1910: 66).
Subsequently, lignite production increased and was about
one million tons annually for the years 1913 through 1920,
excepting 1919. In that year, decreased production was
attributed to labor shortages, suspension of work, and the
displacement of coal as a fuel on some of the railroads
(Gentry 1920). Fewer men were employed at the mines in 1919
than at any time during the previous ten or twelve years.
This was due in part to the tendency for many miners to leave
the mines during the cotton season in order to take advantage
of higher wages paid for picking cotton (Gentry 1920).
Production-~£ lignite was generally strong throughout
the 1920's, fluctuating with the demand from local electric
~ower plants, water-works, and cottonoil mills and gins that
it powered. Output was highest in 1924 and 1925 when 1.5
million tons_of lignite were produced; this figure was not
exceeded until 1960. The Great Depression in the 1930's
initiated an?t~er d:clin7 of the lignite industry.
In constant competition with oil and gas, the industry still
managed to mine 600,000 tons of lignite in 1940. In 1945
production decreased to 75,000 tons and a low of 18 000 tons
was reached in 1950.

cessions, oil and gas competition, and shortages affected
regional outputs which were also subject to the demands and
trends of local markets.
Mining in Bastrop
Lignite in Bastrop County occurs as a deltaic deposit
associated with the Calvert Bluff Formation of the Lower
Eocene Wilcox Group (Bureau of Land Management 1980). The
principal outcrop of these deposits occurs along a line extending roughly northeast to southwest in the northwestern
part of the county. Dipping to the southeast, the stratum
is encountered at greater and greater depths.
Early observations and documentation of lignite occurrence in the county is somewhat scanty. First discovered
in 1837 by James Nicholson and Judge Pinckney Hill (Dumble
1892: 182), early investigation of lignite was slow. In an
1848 statement regarding lignite, sightings were reported
"on Bedias Creek, near the Trinity River, Texas; at Robbin's
Ferry on the Brazos; and at Bastrop, on the Colorado,"
(Hale 1848) and Bastrop coal was mentioned by J. deCordova
in Texa~, He~ Re~ou~Qe~ and He~ PubliQ Men in 1858 (Dumble
1892: 20). Once active study, such as that of the Texas Geological Surve~ began, exposures of lignite beds of varying
thicknesses were documented in Bastrop County at numerous
points along the Colorado River, at Paige, and in the vicinity
of McDade.
About 20 operators have been active in Bastrop County,
most of them between 1880's and 1924 (Fisher 1963: 27 and
146-67). The earliest shaft mine was opened by Edwin Goodman, who probably began in the late 1860's (Schomaker and
Pannell 1978). According to these writers, the Goodman mine
was located about three miles west of Bastrop, marketed locally and active until 1886. In addition to this mine and
limited open-pit prospecting, another early shaft-mine
operation was by W.B. Mowatt of San Antonio in 1892 approximately 1.2 miles southeast of Butler (Dietrich and Lonsdale
1958: 60; Dumble 1892: 183). Operating on Martin's Hollow
Creek, Joseph Black headright, roughly three and one half
miles from McDade and just north of the Houston an<l Texas
Central Railway (now Southern Pacific Railway), the mine was
apparently active for only a few years. A description of
the Mowatt operations was furnished by Dumble (1892):
He (Mowatt) has sunk an eight foot shaft fiftyfive feet in depth. At twenty-seven feet he
found the first seam of brown coal . . . overlaid
by sandstone and underlaid by a clay bed which _
. . . forms the roof of the second seam. . . The
mining will be by chambers. Two galleries have
been cut . . . and one chamber opened. In addition
to the sandstone, which is probably firm enough
to form a good roof, a part of the coal is left

32

for covering. The mining machinery consists of
a fifty horse power boiler, hoisting engine,
etc., and the capacity of the mine can be increased to meet any demands.
Railroads played a major role in the development of the
Texas lignite industry. Due to its low heat value, large
quantities had to be shipped to make mining profitable
(Stenzel 1944: 182). Accessibility to railroad lines and
availability of near-surface lignite deposits were the two
major factors that influenced the locations of mines in
Bastrop County. The lignite outcrop is in the northwestern
part of the county where mining was concentrated along the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad between Sayersville and Bastrop, and along the Southern Pacific Railroad in the vicinity
of Butler and McDade (Kaiser 1974: 15).
Constructed prior to most of the mining venture, both
railroads offered effective means for transportation and
commerce. Organized in 1862, the Houston and Texas Central
Railroad passed through the northern sector of Bastrop County
in 1871 (Moore 1977: 94). In an effort to connect the town
of Bastrop, the county seat, with the towns of Elgin (Bastrop County) and Taylor (Williamson County) to the north, a
stock company, the Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway
Company was formed in 1886. In 1887 this company conveyed
its property and franchises to the Missouri, Kansas, and
Texas Railway Company who completed the line in the same
year (Warner, Dean and Hagerman 1889: 69 and 435).
Most of the historic mining was carried out along an
elongated strip approximately 1.5 miles wide by 9 miles long,
stretching roughly parallel to the strike of the lignite
beds (Deitrich and Lonsdale 1958: 60). Its southern border
extending almost to the Colorado River, the mining area was
generally along the divide between Big Sandy Creek and Piney
Creek. The mines were connected to the main line of the
Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railroad by spur tracks as much
as 1.5 miles long in length.
Up to 1900 or 1901 the mines of Bastrop County were
few and served small markets. While the relative merits of
lignite were being investigated, favorable results had been
obtained by 1892 in using lignite for fuel in the mills and
gin at the town of Bastrop (Dumble 1892: 21). Growing use
of lignite in considerable quantities in Austin, San Antonio
and Waco elicited optimism for the fuel's future demand;
carloads had already been shipped to San Antonio and to the
ice factory in Austin (Dumble 1892: 183). Still, the lignite
market was limited and mines were not always financially
successful.
Early mining ventures were risky and the opening and
closing of mines by different operators occurred frequently.
Some operators abandoned work at the Bastrop mines and relocated their companies to other lignite-rich counties in

POWELL BENV

33

1901 (Phillips 1902: 10). At about the same time, other
investors, such as those of the Glenn Belto Coal Co.,
initiated new attempts to develop the material in Bastrop
County as a profitable fuel source. Many of the early
mining companies were formed by small groups of local
entrepreneurs. The majority of the board of directors of
the Glenn Bel to Coal Company were also shareholders in the
First National Bank of Bastrop, two of these being the
vice-president, T.A. Hasler, and the comptroller, Chester
Erhard, of the Bank (Secretary of State 1900 and Bastrop
Adve~t~~e~ 1899).
Other shareholders included H.P. Luckett,
a Bastrop physician and surgeon, and mine operators Martin
Glenn and his son-in-law John Belto.
Although active mining by this company was brief,
its efforts prompted other larger investments from elsewhere in the state. By leasing their holdings to the Bastrop
Coal Company of Temple in 1904, the directors of the Glenn
Belto Coal Company attracted to local industry an investment
potential over ten times that of their original capital
(Secretary of State 1903; Bastrop County Clerk 1904).
In the following years, further development of the
mining industry was slow.
In 1910 only two mining companies
were operating in the county (Taylor 1911: 7). These were
the Bastrop Coal Company and the Independence Mining Company,
which had organized out of Forth Worth, Texas in 1903 and
opened a mine at Phelan, Bastrop County. Within the next
four years, however, additional development by other companies resulted in six working mines in Bastrop County.
This began an increasing trend in lignite production which
peaked in the mid-1920's. As many as eleven companies were
operating in Bastrop County in 1924; some worked multiple
sites (Broman 1914). This peak in activity coincided well
with the peak year in state-wide productivity and reflects
a surging demand from agricultural-related industries and
the decrease in production of the oil pools (Gentry 1920).
However, this sudden boom was soon followed by an equally
sudden decline. By 1927, only five companies remained in
operation, managing to output 89,451 tons in that year
(Sellards 1929: 27). Most of the companies would discontinue
all work in the following years. The Depression, competition
from the oil industry, and the more efficient extractive
methods of strip-mining introduced in northern counties
brought the industry in Bastrop County to a standstill. The
last shipment of lignite from Bastrop County was made in 1944
(Dietrich and Lonsdale 1958: 60).
Within this overview of the development of the lignite
industry in Bastrop County, specific operations active in
the Powell Bend Prospect can be traced. First to initiate
mining operations within the Powell Bend Prospect was the
Glenn Belto Coal Company. Although the company name is obviously derived from surnames of two stockholders, the

34

SUMMARY OF RESOURCES

specific location and background of this operation presented some difficulty. Vague references to a Glenn Belto
Coal Company were made in a geological report (Phillips
1902) and gave its location as the Bishop Station. It was
enventually determined that the Glenn Belto Coal Co. had
leased 49.25 acres from J.W. Wolfe for purposes of mining
(Bastrop County Clerk 1900). This particular land was once
owned by Thomas Bishop and, as such, had been referenced as
the Bishop tract. These 49-plus acres are on the southeastern
sector of the Powell Bend Prospect along the present Missouri,
Kansas, Texas tracks. Two sites (41BP235 and 238) are mine
shafts in the Bishop tract; one of these was presumably
worked by the Glenn Belto Coal Company.
Little is known of the details of this operation. The
mine had a fifty-foot deep shaft and was ventilated by
furnace (Phillips 1902). John Belto served as superintendent
of a Mexican labor force of about SO. The area was known
briefly as Glenbelto (later Glenham) and received postal
service (Wheat n.d.). John Belto served as postmaster from
May 1901 until April 1905. In March of 1906 postal service
was discontinued and mail routed to Phelan. As previously
mentioned, the Glenn Belto Coal Company leased its holdings
to the Bastrop Coal Company in 1904.
The Bastrop Coal Company was organized in 1903 with
a capital stock of $100,000 and a business office in Temple,
Texas. The directors and principal stockholders were F.E.
Merrill, of Bell County, W.P. Calloway of Jefferson County,
and J.T. Smithers of New York (Secretary of State 1903).
The operations of the Bastrop Coal Company were more extensive than those of the former local enterprise. In addition
to the 49.25 acres leased from Glenn Bel to Coal Co., they
acquired an additional 350 acres. After operating for
almost ten years, this company failed.
In 1914, in accordance with a judgement rendered by the District Court in
Bell County, Texas, all of the company's holdings in Bastrop
County were publically auctioned. James E. Ferguson was the
successful bidder (Bastrop County Clerk 1914). The following
year Ferguson sold the lands, structures, and mining equipment to F.L. Denison and the Bastrop Lignite Coal Company
(Bastrop County Clerk 1915). Formed out of Temple, the
company had several directors including F.L. Denison, F.W.
Denison and J.H. Davis, Jr. (Secretary of State 1915). The
Bastrop Lignite Coal Company and the Denison operations were
active within the present study area, in adjacent tracts, and
in other areas of Bastrop County. A later-formed Denison
Coal Company mined at the Sayer's Mine in Camp Swift and near
Sayersville (Gentry 1920). One of the Denison-owned mines
provided the last shipment of lignite from Bastrop County in
1944. The longevity of the Denison operations was in part
attributable to their contract to supply lignite for the
University of Texas power plants (Schomaker and Pannell 1978).

Another mining venture once active within the Powell
Bend Prospect was the Calvin Coal Company. Chartered in
1910, the Calvin Coal Company was formed largely by Bexar
County investors; chief among them was W.C. Silliman (Secretary of State 1910). A member of the State Mining Board
in 1910 (Galveston-Dallas News 1910), Silliman was president
of the corporation and principal investor. Acting for the
Calvin Coal Company, he secured 453 acres of coal field in
Bastrop County from W.B. Ransom in 1910 (Bastrop County
Clerk 1910).
Although most of the original investors had been Bexar
County residents, one resident of Bastrop County, R.M. Waugh,
became affiliated with the company in 1920 (Secretary of
State 1910. Giving his address as Calvin, Texas (41BP233),
a small hamlet largely supported by the mining operation,
Waugh continued operations out of Calvin for some time. A
Waugh Coal Company was active in Bastrop in the late 1920's
and through the 1930's, possibly indicating an extension of
the Calvin operations.
Two principal methods of mining were used at the mines
in Bastrop - slope mining and perpendicular shaft mining.
Statewide, shaft mining was the predominant form of extraction although slope mines accounted for one-third of the
total in 1924 (Bullock 1924). Primary references to the
general method of mining and particular hardware used in the
Bastrop mines is documented but specific details of each of
these methods is unclear. The writer has relied upon details of the extractive procedures furnished by Fett (1969)
and Gentry (1920).
·
Slope mines are most practical in areas of surface or
shallow outcrops of lignite. By entering the point of the
outcrop and following the dip or rise in the deposit, extraction was handily accomplished. Once loaded, carts were
hauled by mules to the lowest point of the slope and hoisted
by steam engine and cable. Although few in number, slope
mines in Bastrop County were reportedly worked by the Consumers
Lignite Company and the Bastrop Coal Company in 1914. Other
slope mines were being operated in 1920 by F.L. Denison and
by the Calvin Coal Company (Broman 1914: 16; Gentry 1920).
The primary form of mining in Bastrop County was the
shaft mine. A vertical shaft is sunk to the depth of the
desired lignite deposit and mined by means of horizontal
tunnels, or adits, which extend roughly perpendicular to the
main vertical shaft and follow the rise of the workable
seam. The bottom of the vertical shaft is invariably the
lowest point of the mine, i.e., the down-dip side of the lignite bed. This arrangement provided a slope down which
loaded cars could run and the bottom of the vertical shaft
was a collection point for any water leaking into the horizontal shafts. Water that collected in the shaft bottom
could then be readily pumped out.

Actual m1n1ng of the lignite employed a ''room and
pillar" system to allow for systematic extraction and support
of the tunnel roof. This method of mining was used in all
the shaft mines in Bastrop County (Bullock 1924). Critical
to safety and survival, the pillars nonetheless accounted
for much of the inefficiency of this type of mining. In
underground operations, where pillars must be left, recovery
is on the order of only fifty percent (Fisher 1963: 7).
Lignite was mined by hand-pick and shovel, loaded into
carts and hauled by mules to the bottom of the main shaft.
The carts were rolled into a cage and the whole assembly
hoisted out of the shaft by cable and steam engine.
Miners were paid per cart or per ton dug and wages were
low. In 1902 the average was 35 cents per ton (Phillips
1902: 6); in 1924 Bastrop County miners were paid about 50
cents per ton (Thomas unpublished report). It is not surprising that workers sought employment elsewhere during
seasonal agricultural harvests.
By 1902, the labor force at the lignite mines in Texas
varied in ethnic and regional backgrounds (Phillips 1902:
5-6). At the Bertetti mine in Medina County, Italians
provided the labor; in Shelby and Wood counties, AngloAmerican labor was largely employed. Blacks were a large
proportion of the laborers in the Houston Coal Company
mines and Mexicans worked the mines of Bastrop County and the
Rockdale region. Many early State Mining Inspector's
reports cited labor shortages and lack of efficiency as
major probelms in the mining industry. These problems,
as well as punctuality, were averted by one mining company
located near Calvert, Robertson County. Convicts were the
labor force at this mine. Fed and clothed by the state,
housed in barracks and accompanied by guards to and from the
mines, they were both prompt and efficient (Phillips 1902).
Between 1901 and 1928 the number of fatalities in
Texas' bituminous coal and lignite industries totaled seventy.
Close to one-half of these deaths were due to roof falls and
pillar collapse (Bullock 1928: 4). In Bastrop County approximately thirteen Mexicans reportedly died while employed in
the mining industry and are buried in a small cemetery in
Camp Swift (Skelton and Freeman 1979: 101).
Both Glenham (41BP235) and Calvin (41BP233) are now
abandoned. At the Calvin site no standing structures remain
and only careful scrutiny of the ground confirms the existence of a once-active hamlet.
Mining companies and company towns were features of
this historic period throughout Texas, and Bastrop County
was no exception. Phelan, Calvin, Glenham were towns
largely supported by the lignite industry. Company-owned
housing was commonly provided for, or rented to, the laborers
and their families, and a commissary made available. In
1920 fifty-three tenant houses and a commissary building

stood at Calvin (Dobson 1920). Although unincorporated, the
town did have its own post office from 1912 to at least
1921 (Wheat n.d.) and reported a population of fifty as late
as 1940 (Webb 1952: 274).

SUMMARY SITE DESCRIPTIONS
Tested Prehistoric Sites
41BP191
This campsite occupies the sandy terraces and lower
valley margins north of the main drainage through the study
area. Portions of the site have been disturbed by alteration
for rangeland resulting in accelerated erosion in some areas.
Lithic debitage and burned rock fragments are most exposed
in the ranch road bordering the NE-SW fence row and in shallow
erosional features. The site covers an extensive area.
Shovel probes revealed a relatively deep alluvial deposit
with concentrations of cultural materials and testing was
recommended. This testing indicated multiple activities
associated with upland terrace occupation by prehistoric
peoples and partial retention of cultural context.
41BP192
This small lithic/burned rock scatter is situated on
the western edge of a small tributary which drains N-NW.
Cores and lithic debitage are lightly scattered on the surface
of the eastward-declining slopes. A partially intact hearth
feature composed of quartzite, chert and sandstone cobbles
and slabs was systematically exposed by the testing procedures
indicating possible retention of cultural contexts of adjacent
areas.
41BP218
This campsite occupies a deep sandy terrace along the
western edge of a dense post oak-yaupon woodland bordering
an open pasture. The terrace lies at the confluence of two
tributaries draining westward. Lithic debitage and burned
rock fragments were exposed in the deep rills incised into
the western slope of the terrace. In the northern profile of
one of these rills burned rocks were observed during survey
about 10 cm. below the surface of the ground. Subsequent
testing has revealed severe mixing of cultural material at
this site.
41BP229
This multi-component site occupies the sandy terraces
north of the main drainage channel flowing westward. Small
tributaries border the site on its east and west meander to
join the main channel south-southwesterly. The prehistoric
component is characterized by scattered tertiary flakes and
burned rock fragments with localized concentrations. Shovel
probes revealed deep-lying burned rock and flakes occurring
in relatively discrete areas of the site. The testing program
has revealed severe mixing of these deposits. Intermixed
with the prehistoric surface residues, historic artifacts are

POWELL BENV

43

thinly distributed on the terraces and within a small drainage
bottom. Materials on the terrace include fragments of
crockery, glazed pottery and a porcelain doll fragment. No
structural remnants were noted. Within the adjacent shallow
drainage, a dense collection of bricks and brick fragments
have been discarded. These materials are associated with the
historic site (41BP233) lying to the north.
Sites Recommended for Protective Maintenance
41BP233
The site is located on the northern boundary of the
Prospect directly east of the eastern boundary of the mining
zone. Situated on the rolling, gravel-covered slopes and
gentle hills, the site represents the remains of Calvin,
Texas, a small hamlet closely associated with the mining
operations of the Calvin Coal Company.
Presently, historic debris extends across the open,
undulating rangeland from the present railroad tracks south
to the terraces of the drainage system. Although sparse on
the surface, greater densities of materials were revealed in
shallow probing of the soil in the central and northeaster~
sectors of the site. Fragments of white ware, glass and
crockery are primary surface materials with a few scattered
bricks and brick fragments. Additionally, the ranch road at
the site, presently used for land access, once represented
the main rail spur connecting the major mine shafts and the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway. Partially buried railroad ties and concrete footings are still evident in the bed
of the ranch road.*
41BP235
The site is located on the southeast sector of the
Powell Bend Prospect roughly four miles north of Bastrop,
Texas, on Highway 95. Paralleling the route of the M.K.T.
Railway, the site forms the major portion of the mining community of Dunston (formerly Glenham). Remnants of both industrial and domiciliary structures and debris are evident
throughout an extensive area both in open ranges and in mesquite-thicketed underbrush.
The site has witnessed a number of lignite mining
operations since the turn of the century commencing with a
locally owned enterprise. Although not the earliest known
mine site, the Glenham site may have been the place of the
longest term of mining and mining-related activity in Bastrop
County.
Included in the lengthy list of observed historic remains are collapsed (and collapsing) A-frame structures, concrete footings and foundations of industrial hardware, a
barn, a remnant railroad engine boiler, a brick column of
the company commissary, possible mine shafts, mining cart

SUMMARY SITE DESCRIPTIONS

axles and considerable quantities of scattered debris and
miscellaneous structures. Additionally, relict ground relief
of the network of railroad spurs and tracks which served to
connect the points of extraction with the main M.K.T. tracks
is sometimes evident. Some lengths of these spurs now serve
as ranch roads.
41BP240
The site is located roughly 275 m. west of the western
boundary of the mining zone and about 90 m. due north of a
buried gas pipeline. Situated on the margin of a dense post
oak-yaupon thicket, this lithic/burned rock scatter is bordered
by tributaries to the south and east. The south-lying drainage
represents the main channel flowing east-to-west through
the study area.
Cultural debris is scattered along the lower edge of a
sandy slope projection directly overlooking the narrow alluvial terrace of the channel. Burned rock and burned rock
fragments of chert and sandstone are the principally observed
surface materials. Secondary flakes of chert were also noted.
Shovel probes revealed subsurface materials occurring
in considerable densities at depths of 35 cm. below th~ surface.
In more heavily thicketed areas, the sandy texture
appeared finer and cultural materials extended to 50 cm. in
depth.
Sites Not Recommended for Further Assessment
Prehistoric
41BP219
This large site is situated on the gravel-strewn upper
valley margins bordering a small northeast draining tributary
to the west. Cobble procurement/quarrying activities are
indicated by the abundance of primary reduction debris, cores
and gravel cobbles. Other activities are evidenced by a
light scatter of burned rock fragments and time-diagnostic
projectile points indicating at least Archaic period utilization of this densely wooded area.
41BP220
This lithic/burned rock scatter is situated on the lower
valley margins south of a broad drainage system flowing northwest. Diffuse scatters of large gravel cobbles, cores and
debitage are best exposed along a narrow access road cleared
through the northern perimeter of a post oak woodland.
41BP221
The site is situated on the gravelly upper valley margin overlooking a narrow terrace feature to the west. Cultural materials are scattered amidst the densely occurring

POWELL BENV

45

natural cobbles and obscured by woodland leaf litter. Cores
and lithic debitage are common with one biface fragment found
on the western terrace extension of the site.
41BP222
This small lithic scatter is situated on the lower
valley margins adjacent to a minor west-flowing tributary.
A few chert flakes were observed in a small open erosional
feature amid the dense ground cover.
41BP223
This site is situated on a gravel-covered slope projection directly overlooking the meandering channel of a
tributary draining westward. Cultural materials consist
mostly of core fragments, primary reduction debris and one
bifacial core.
41BP224
This small scatter was noted along the route of an
underground gas pipeline near the confluence of two tributary drainages below a low terrace. Cultural materials are

41BP227
This cobble procurement site is situated on the relatively level summit of an upland divide densely strewn with
large cobble gravels. Core fragments and lithic debris were
observed on this badly disturbed site.
41BP228
A very light scatter of secondary and tertiary chert
flakes were exposed along a road cut on the upper valley
margins. Inspection of adjacent areas revealed no additional
materials.

SUMMARY SITE VESCRIPTIONS

46

41BP241
The site consists of an isolated artifact situated on
the southern edge of the Prospect near the head of a small
fifth order tributary which drains the upper valley margins.
Numerous chert gravel cobbles were strewn among the growth
of scrubby mesquite. The core biface may represent procurement or primary reduction activity.
41BP242
This isolated find of a secondary chert flake is located on the sandy upland deposits occurring on the far
western edge of the Prospect. The surface topography slopes
to the west toward Sandy Creek about 300 m. distant. Shovel
probes indicated no additional materials in the sandy matrix.
41BP243
This lithic scatter is situated on the sandy upland
deposits occurring on the far western edge of the Prospect.
Cultural materials were exposed in back dirt mounds of
rodent burrows and were thinly distributed across the open
pasture. The site lies at the northwest base of a high upland knoll and has been affected by the previous woodland
clearing and coastal planting. Shovel probes in the area
revealed a loose sand more than 80 cm. deep and few cultural
materials. Only a few tertiary flakes and chert fragments
were recovered from surface inspections and probes.
41BP244
The site is located in the western sector of the Prospect just outside the western perimeter of the mining zone.
This surface scatter is sparsely distributed over the north
and northeast sloping margins of the sandy upland deposits.
A north-flowing tributary has incised into this upland area
about 50 m. north-northeast of the site. Shovel probes revealed sand more than 70 cm. deep and no cultural depth to
the site.
41BP245

This small lithic/burned rock scatter is situated on
the western edge of a fourth order drainage incised through
the upland sandy deposits found in the western sector of the
Prospect. The site rests on the edge of the steep drainage
banks and at the north-northeastern base of a high upland
knoll. Cultural materials consist of lithic debitage and a
few burned rock fragments. No depth to the cultural deposits
was indicated by shovel probes.
41BP246

The site is located in the western sector of the study
area on the upper valley margins of the upland sandy deposits.
The surface topography is rolling to level and planted in
coastal bermuda. The lithics and burned rock fragments are

POWELL BENV

47

diffusely scattered across this area which slopes greatly to
the northeast. Shovel probes revealed a deep sand, more than
90 cm., and only very few subsurface materials.
41BP247
The site is situated on a rugged upland divide separating two north-flowing fourth order drainages. Located
on the south-southeastern sector of the study area, this
quarry site is crossed by ranch roads, fence rows and cattle
trails. Erosion is evident across the undulating surface and
is most apparent near the edges of numerous small runoff
drainages.
Cores, core fragments and large quantities of naturallyoccurring split and whole cobbles are strewn among the growth
of scrubby mesquite. These cultural residues are restricted
to surface materials and have been apparently disturbed by
the rangeland use and natural erosion.
41BP248
This lithic/burned rock scatter is located on the
eastern sector of the Prospect approximately 300 m. southwest
of the tracks of the M.K.T. Railway. The site covers a
small open area of pasture and scattered mesquite and is
bordered by a fence row about 30 m. to the east. Cultural
materials are sparse and limited to a few secondary chert
flakes and burned rock fragments. Shovel probes revealed no
cultural depth in the loamy sand (30 cm. deep) overlying the
red clay substrate.
41BP249
The site is lcoated on the upper valley margins about
400 m. west of the M.K.T. tracks where they form the eastern
boundary of the Prospect. Cultural materials are lightly
scattered in an open thicket of mesquite and post oak and
straddle a fence row which extends NE-SW. Tertiary flakes
of chert and burned rock fragments were located on the surface
of the site and recovered in very light density in the shallow
loamy sands (20 cm. deep).
Historic and Prehistoric
41BP230
This multicomponent site occupies the lower sloping
valley margins south of the mainstem tributary tributary
channel. The historic material is scattered along the terrace
edge and consists of fragments of crockery, white ware and
glass. No structures or structural remnants were noted. The
prehistoric materials are equally sparse and consist of
lithic debitage and burned rock fragments.

48

SUMMARY SITE DESCRIPTIONS

41BP231
This multicomponent site is situated on the edge of a
small upland rise and is marked by the absence of chert and
quartzite gravel cobbles. A few scattered tertiary flakes
comprise the prehistoric component with the historic material
limited to one small glazed potsherd.
41BP236
This site is located on the far northeastern section
of the Prospect approximately 300 m. west of the western
border of the mining zone. Situated on the upper edge of a
high, gently sloping hill, historic debris is scattered
across the open rangeland. Glass, porcelain, brick and metal
fragments are surface-exposed among low, thorny mesquite
and ground cover. Shallow probes of the soil indicated considerably greater densities of materials occurring in the
southern section of the site. The red bricks and brick fragments are hand-molded with gravel and plant fiber temper.
Probably made from the local clays, the size of these bricks
indicate mid-to-late 19th century manufacture. A very light
surface scatter of prehistoric chert flakes were also noted
on the site.
41BP258
This prehistoric quarry and historic scatter has been
badly eroded and bulldozed. This site is on an upper valley
margin immediately west of a dirt road that previously served
as a railroad spur line between the Calvin community (41BP233)
and the Calvin Mine #2 (41BP252). Evidence of initial reduction of chert cobbles was found on an eroded clay knoll
top and slopes which descend northward to the head of a small
drainage. A few bricks and metal debris were the only historic
materials observed.
41BP259
This very diffuse scatter of both prehistoric and
historic debris is located on the eroded slopes of a knoll
in a lower valley margin. Prehistoric materials consisted
mostly of cores and primary and secondary flakes which were
noted among the naturally-occurring chert gravels. A few
burned rocks were also seen. The historic debris included
several brick fragments and pieces of scrap metal which were
found on the west side of a dirt road described in the discussion of site 41BP258. No evidence of a former structure
could be found.
41BP260
A thin scatter of historic debris associated with the
nearby Glenham site (41BP235) and an isolated dart point fragment were found in the vicinity of a dirt road in the southeast part of the project area. Crockery and porcelain frag-

POWELL BENV

49

ments indicate a probable early 20th century date for the
historic component. There was no evidence of a structure
or a concentrated dump area.
A fragmentary En~o~ or Ma~co~-like dart point was discovered in the roadbed on the east edge of the site. Although there are many naturally occurring chert cobbles in
the area, no evidence of prehistoric utilization was seen.
Historic
41BP232
Historic material is scattered across the upland flat
and eastern slopes of a gravel-strewn hill. Although no
structures or structural remnants persist, the abundance of
white ware, crockery and glass fragments possibly indicate
a former residence associated with the Calvin community
(41BP233).
41BP234
Several basin-shaped depressions varying from 2 to 10
m. in diameter were noted along the northern edge of a headward drainage. These features are associated with a cylindrical, open vertical mine shaft (1.5 m. diameter x 4.0 m.
deep) and may have resulted from subsidence or collapse. No
historic structural remnants or artifactual debris were
observed.
41BP237
This site is situated on the east bank of a north-flowing
tributary on the inside of a curve in the M.K.T. railroad
tracks. Materials found included a seventeen-inch square
brick foundation which stands nine inches above the ground
and contains an inlaid U-shaped pipe, an adjacent concrete
wall that stands 2~ feet high, and a sparse scatter of glass,
bricks and white ware ceramics. No evidence of a former house
location was found unless it stood at the north end of the
site where there are three big oak trees and a cluster of
iris flowers. This site is probably associated with mining
operations originating at Glenham (41BP235).
41BP238
This site is located in the southwest portion of the
project area approximately 90 m. west of State Highway 95
and 20 m. west of the M.K.T. railroad tracks. The remains of
a coal mining operation were observed on both sides of a
creek in an area approximately 225 by 100 meters.
A large mine shaft entrance currently filled with approximately 3 m. of water is situated in the southwest
part of the site. The pond presently covers a 22 x 14 m.
horizontal area. Concrete foundation runners varying from
20 to 40 cm. in thickness are stationed at both the north
and south edges of the pond. The foundations at the southern

50

SUMMARY SITE DESCRIPTIONS

end are a 3 x 4 meter "H"-shaped set that probably provided
a platform for machinery. The concrete runners at the north
end of the pond are only partially visible as they extend
below the surface of the water. They may have served as the
foundation for a structure.
A 2 m. high backdirt pile that measures 10 x 20 m.
horizontally is located upslope on the east side of the shaft.
About 40 m. east of the backdirt pile across the creek bed
is the first of a series of four hollow, oval-shaped, elevated
concrete foundations. These were found in the thick brush
on the east bank of the creek in a north-south line at intervals varying from 15 to 30 m. Each of these foundations
measured 4S x 60 cm. horizontally and were 3S cm. in height.
They may have functioned as air vents for mine shafts. However at present this is not definitive.
About 20 m. northeast of the northernmost of these oval
foundations is a 2 x 2 m. pile of pieces of concrete. The
concave shape of most pieces suggest that they fitted around
a 10 to 15 cm. thick pipe.
On the eastern edge of the site about 70 m. east of
the creek, a house had once stood next to the M.K.T tracks.
Glass, bricks and a possible well were found in a SO x SO m.
area among several juniper trees. Most of the bricks were
impressed with the name "T.F.B. Co.". No evidence of a
structure or foundations were noted. It is problematic as
to whether this structure is related to the coal mining or
is an unrelated farmhouse.
41BP239
This site consists of the remains of two deteriorated
structures that are located southwest and upslope from 41BP238. One of these is a totally collapsed structure that
lies about SO m. southwest of the mine shaft at 41BP238. The
structure apparently measured about 12 x 30 ft. originally
and was constructed with round nails. No glass, ceramic or
any other cultural debris was noticed in the thick vegetation
surrounding the pile of scrap lumber where the house had
stood.
Most of the north and part of the east wall of the
second structure are still standing. This A-frame structure
stood about 110 m. southwest of the first and was originally
about 12 x 24 feet. A seldom-used dirt road runs east-west
about 2S m. south of the structure.
The 1938 aerial photo shows two additional buildings
in the area between the two here described. No structural
evidence of these two remained. All four may have been domiciles inhabited by coal miners.
41BP250
This site represents the remains of a coal mining operation related to the Glenham complex (41BP23S). It lies about
160 m. west of Glenham and is connected to it by a railroad

POWELL BENV

51

spur. The principal cluster of remains at this site is located
on an upland ridge in a dense mesquite thicket. Included in
this group are a wooden shack, a large, stacked brick pile
and an "H"-shaped foundation platform. The bricks may have
once formed a structure which stood west of the H-shaped platform. Most of these are stamped "Standard".
About 30 m. to the north and downslope in the bottom of
a gully, a presumed collapsed mine shaft was observed. Other
evidence of mining activities was found in the gullies south
of the ridge and included slag dumps, scrap metal, bricks and
slumps from other collapsed mine shafts.
41BP251
This historic site is located on a knoll on the east
side of a dirt road which was formerly the path of the railroad spur line that connected the Calvin Mine #2 (41BP252)
with the Calvin community (41BP233). The Calvin community
lies only 140 m. north of this site. Debris observed at 41BP251 consists of concrete foundation runners and blocks,
a few unstamped bricks and an 18-meter-long section of pipe.
One partially exposed concrete foundation lies only about
10 m. off the road and probably supported the west wall of a
structure. Other elevated foundations may have been foundations for tipple structures or may have housed machinery
related to coal production. This site may be the remains of
Calvin Mine #1.
41BP252
This historic site includes the remains of the Calvin
#2 coal mining operation, a burned home site and two standing
structures. In the southeast portion of the site a 9-meter
diameter mine shaft entrance with surrounding intact concrete
foundations and an adjacent railroad spur grade were found.
The shaft entrance is filled with household garbage, lumber,
tin and chunks of broken concrete foundations. Some intact
foundations occupy a 6-meter-wide area between the shaft and
the railroad spur, while two other large elevated concrete
blocks about 10 m. north of the shaft presently support a
water tank.
About 90 m. northwest of the shaft some burned bricks
were observed on a knolltop in a cluster of cedar trees. Two
small houses are located in the northeast part of the site
about 35 m. north of the shaft. One is a semi-standing
dilapidated shack, while the other is in better condition and
may have been occupied until recently. A barn, corral and
stable in the southern part of the site are currently used
in ranching activities.
41BP253
This burned home site was situated in a small clearing
surrounded by post oaks about 40 m. east of the dirt road

52

SUMMARY SITE DESCRIPTIONS

referred to in the description of site 41BP251. A large
rusted water tank that is about 10 ft. high and 9 ft. in diameter is visible from the road. Household debris, burned
and unburned, is spread over the surface of the site. Occupied until recently, the site was the former residence of
a farmworker couple.
41BP254
This site is situated on the banks and in the bed of
a gully located about 100 m. north of the Calvin Mine #2
complex (41BP252). The remains of an historic structure,
p0ssibly dumped, are represented at this site. Piles of
lumber, pipes and scrap metal cover most of the site. The
presence of round nails and the fairly good preservation of
the lumber indicates a relatively recent date.
41BP255
This historic scatter consists of numerous bricks and
some glass fragments, oyster shell fragments, metal scraps
and railroad spikes which lie along the sides of a section
of an elevated railroad spur. The spur section is distinguishable for a length of about 225 m. and represents a portion of the railroad that connected the Calvin Mine #2 (41BP252) with the Calvin Community (41BP233). The most concentrated debris consists of bricks which had been dumped
into a 4-meter-wide gully traversed by the spur.
41BP256
This historic site is located immediately west of the
former railroad spur (now ranch road) that runs through the
central part of the survey area. Cultural material is restricted to bricks and molded blocks which appear to have
been dumped into a small gully.
41BP257
This small historic site is an 18 x 21 ft. deteriorated
corral located between site 41BP233(Calvin community) and
41BP256. The corral was constructed of oak and/or cedar
posts, some of which are nailed together with round 16-penny
nails. In other cases the posts are tied together with
bailing wire. Each side of the enclosure had three separate
horizontal rows of posts and portions of the north and east
sides are missing.

REPORT SUMMARY
The cultural resources of Powell Bend were assessed in
the context of proposed mining plans. Those sites within
the prime zone would be more severely affected than those
in the buffer zone, and were thus more critically evaluated.
Following a records review, field study was implemented.
Field work consisted of intensive ground coverage of the
Prospect and surface assessment of cultural sites located.
The surface assessments served as the basis for subsequent
test excavations at four selected sites (all prehistoric)
within the mining zone. Intended as a site evaluative procedure, the testing program has provided a detailed examination of the nature of the selected sites and their interpretive potentials to explaining prehistoric upland
adaptations.
Ground inspection of the Prospect resulted in the identification of 45 previously unrecorded sites (Fig. 2). Seventeen cultural sites occur wholly or predominantly within the
boundaries of the mining zone. Of these, 12 are prehistoric,
two are historic, and the remaining three have both historic
and prehistoric components. Lying outside the mining zone,
but within the construction area, 28 cultural sites were
identified (11 prehistoric, 13 historic, and four historic/
prehistoric).
PREHISTORIC
Thirty prehistoric sites and sites having prehistoric
components were located. Of these, fifteen sites occur wholly
or predominantly within the boundaries of the mining zone
and the remaining fifteen are located in the adjacent 800acre construction area.
Four general site types are recognized on the basis of
surficially-exposed cultural residues: quarry sites, lithic
scatters, lithic/burned rock scatters and isolated finds.
Six quarry sites, eight lithic scatters, thirteen lithic/
burned rock scatters and three isolated finds were recorded.
The major terrain features in the uplands of the Colorado River basin are terraces, valley margins, upland divides
and flood plains. Fifteen prehistoric sites were located
on the valley margins (four lithic scatters, six lithic/
burned rock scatters, four quarry sites and one isolated find).
Five sites (one lithic scatter and four lithic/burned rock
scatters) were situated on the terraces developed along the
main channel flowing through the Prospect. Four sites (two
quarries, one lithic scatter and one isolated find) were on
the upland interfluvial divides. Six sites (two lithic
scatters, three lithic/burned rock scatters and one isolated

54

REPORT SUMMARY

find) occurred in sandy deposits of variant upland features
found on the western sector of the Prospect near Big Sandy
Creek. Whether due to their absence or concealment by
surface accretion, no sites were found in the active flood
plains.
The condition of any prehistoric site is generally
related to its association with particular terrain features
and patterns of land use. Sites found on the sloping, upland
divides and valley margins are often eroded, consist of
surface-only materials, and retain little or no structural
integrity. Cultural contexts are largely erased by slope
erosion and past historic activity - agricultural, ranching
and historic mining. Sites located on terraces developed
along the main channel flowing through the study area hold
better potential for intact deposits where aggrading surfaces
and sediment depth often provide for retention of cultural
contexts.
The archeological investigation was oriented toward the
location and assessment of cultural sites subject to the
effects of mining. Direct impact is unavoidable within the
mining zone and immediate information-gathering procedures
were initiated. Based on surface assessments of the sites
located within the mining zone, four (all prehistoric) warranted evaluative testing. Three of these (41BP191, 218 and
229) are on sandy alluvial terraces; one site (41BP192) is
situated on the valley margins. During the survey the sites
demonstrated cultural depth in shovel probes, variability
in their artifact assemblage, and/or cultural features.
Burned rock concentrations/hearths were exposed in erosional
features at two sites, 41BP192 and 218.
The results of test excavations at these sites and
evaluations of their potential value vary. Sites 41BP218
and 229 lack archeologically significant materials in stratigraphic context. Artifacts at these probable camp sites were
severely mixed by root and rodent activity. Mixing of cultural deposits was also exhibited at 41BP192, however, this
disturbance was less extensive and severe and excavations
exposed a relatively intact hearth/oven. Testing at 41BP191
was productive. Tool manufacture, food processing and cooking
are suggested by recovered materials and the exposed hearth/
oven feature.
(See Appendix I, Subsurface Testing.)
Preliminary examination of trends in site distribution
and results of testing relate to recognized needs and resources available to prehistoric people. Although the record
is relatively scanty and differentially preserved, two prime
resources are water and cobbles suitable for making stone
tools and for hearth construction. During the course of this
survey, no perennial source of water was observed within the
study area, although a fairly reliable source lay in the
channel of Big Sandy Creek not too far distant. Assuming
similar conditions in prehistory, occupation might have been

POWELL BENV

55

seasonal and/or intermittent excursions into this upland
segment in search of game, to procure and/or process vegetal
resources and lithic materials or any combination of these.
Vast quantities of cobbles on valley margins and
divides, and the large lithic procurement/quarry sites
associated with the deposits, indicate the great extent of
procurement activities. Many of the small, diffuse lithic
scatters and lithic/burned rock scatters are located adjacent
to, or relatively near, these quarries or areas of gravel
outcrop. Although this distribution may be a function of
the widespread nature of the gravel deposits, it does emphasize the accessibility of these resources.
In addition to those sites devoted primarily to cobble
procurement and lithic workshops, a few are more complex.
Multiple activities and resource use are indicated by the
density and diversity of the artifact assemblage, size and
location near water. These more intensively or frequently
occupied sites, such as 41BP191, are found on terraces
developed along the main tributary channel (3rd order stream)
flowing through the study area. Although not presently
discharging, this channel receives seasonal runoff from
most of the water-courses draining the uplands and valley
margins of the study area. Thus, the heavily-wooded growth
along channel banks might retard evaporation and prolong
pools of water in depressed areas of the channel. Such pools
could have attracted both game and aboriginal hunters.
In addition to potential water sources, the sandy terraces in this upland segment also provide ready access to
gravel resources. Somewhat level terraces develop below the
valley margins, which are generally laden with gravel deposit.
HISTORIC
Twenty-two sites with historic materials were located
in this survey. Of these, fifteen are solely historic and
seven have both historic and prehistoric components. Five
sites are in the mining zone, the remaining seventeen in the
construction area.
The most striking historic features are those associated
with past mining operations and the communities which arose
from this industry. Most of the historic sites within the
Prospect boundaries are industrial and residential remnants
of past lignite mining. Two major complexes related to this
activity persist - the former communities of Calvin and
Gle~ham.

One site, 41BP235, is located on the southeast sector
of the Prospect and is presently referred to as Dunstan;
it has also been known as Glenham and/or Glenbelto. During
mining operations, which began in the early 1900's, this was
a site of lignite extraction and shipping and the residence
of both mine operators and laborers.

56

REPORT SUMMARY

Numerous features of past habitation and industry can
be found at Glenham: collapsed and collapsing A-frame houses,
concrete footings and foundations for industrial equipment,
a barn, the remnants of a railroad engine boiler, a brick
column of the company commissary, possible mine shafts, mining
cart axles and considerable quantities of scattered debris.
Additionally, relict ground relief shows some of the network
of railway spurs and tracks which served to connect the
points of extraction with the main M.K. & T. track. For
example, a spur line can be seen originating at 41BP250, a
probable mine shaft area, and extending east through the
main Dunstan (Glenham) complex.
Over a considerable period of time, the area has been
part of mining efforts by various concerns including the
Glenn Belto Coal Company, the Bastrop Coal Company, the
Bastrop Lignite Coal Company and the Denison operations. In
addition to the Glenham site, other historic sites originated
from these companies' mining activities, including sites
41BP237, 239, 250 and 260.
The second historic complex is located at 41BP233, the
site of the former community of Calvin. It once consisted
of over fifty tenant houses and a commissary and, like Glenham, was largely supported by the operating mines. Although
other mining operations were active around Calvin, remaining
features are those of the Calvin Coal Company. Features of
coal transport are still evident. Part of a ranch road
presently extending south from the Calvin site once served
as the bed for a rail spur; a fragment of an old railroad
tie was seen partially buried in this road. Brick fragments
and debris line the roadbed as it extends south to a former
mine site, 41BP252 (Calvin Mine #2), and remnant concrete
industrial foundations persist at 41BP251.
One additional historic site, 41BP236, deserves mention.
Located in the far northeast sector of the Prospect, historic
debris indicated mid-to-late 1800's activities - the earliest
historic materials identified in the survey. On re-inspection
immediately prior to this reporting, 41BP236 was found to
have been inadvertently root-plowed for pasture development
and totally obliterated. Further identification was not
possible. The record review of the Prospect suggests a
general pattern of agricultural and stock-raising prior to
the advent of the mining industry.

57

RECOMMENDATIONS
Sites located and examined during the course of these
investigations have been assessed in perspective to proposed mining and mining-related land use objectives. The
primary area, designated for direct lignite extraction, covers
400 acres and sites within this zone are considered unavoidably subject to destruction.
The four sites tested within the mining zone, 41BP191,
192, 218 and 229, have varied in content, condition and
potential value to further study. Cultural materials at
sites 41BP218 and 229 were found to be severely mixed, and
lacking in time-diagnostic materials or features. No further
work is recommended for these sites.
Site 41BP192, although mildly mixed, has retain sufficient integrity, as evidenced by the intact hearth/oven,
to warrant additional examination. The condition of the
feature indicates possible retention of cultural context.
In addition to establishing temporal placement, further investigation may expose discrete loci of activities associated
with the hearth. Such investigation is warranted.
Site 41BP191 holds the best potential for explanation
of prehistoric upland activities. Although the entire area
of the site is not intact, certain parts exhibit stability
and a potential variability in artifact assemblage representing
differing activities across the site. The intact circular
hearth/oven suggests possible presence of intact cultural
deposits in adjacent areas. With further examination, food
preparation and processing areas might be exposed providing
insight into preferences and exploitation strategies. Other
resources might be detected by examination of areas of the
site reported to contain a high material density and numerous
trimmed flakes. Given the presence of stone tool manufacturing and cooking activities suggested at the site and the
proximity of gravel deposits and quarry sites, additional
investigations at this site might be enhanced by including
comparative examinations of lithic materials. Although the
quarry sites are generally disturbed, a sample collection of
cultural and natural materials may provide a comparative
base for debitage and tool forms found at 41BP191, indicating
cultural preference and selection. Further study of 41BP191
is recommended.
Based on the surface assessments of cultural sites
located in the survey, three sites within the construction
zone are recommended for avoidance or protective maintenance.
One prehistoric site, 41BP240, demonstrated, through shovel
probes, some depth and density to its cultural deposit. The
site may have areas of intact cultural deposit and/or features.
The site partially occupies a low terrace developed along
the main channel flowing through the Prospect. The two

58

RECOMMENVATIONS

historic sites (41BP233 and 235) recommended for preservation
are representative of a discrete period of local history.
Both Calvin (41BP233) and Glenham (41BP235) are two of only
a few communities directly related to the historic mining
period in Bastrop County. These sites offer an opportunity
to examine the material culture and human issues of small
but unique communities and industrial networks. Unique in
function and pertinent to local historical development, sites
related to this phenomenon offer interesting challenges to
investigators. Recognition of these sites alone is insufficient; an historic sketch of this activity has left many
avenues to explore.
Sites within the Prospect not recommended for additional
i investigation or preservation efforts have been viewed in
accordance with their potential to yield meaningful interpretive data. Most of the prehistoric sites were found to
be severely disturbed, either through post-occupational
land use activities or natural vectors. Sites of low artifact density and sites which lack varied and associated
artifact assemblages, such as isolated finds and thin scatters, add little to the archeological interpretive record
beyond their recorded presence. Thus, prehistoric sites
which lack structural integrity and variability in cultural
deposits are considered to be of limited scientific potential
and are not recommended for additional investigation.
Recommendations for the historic sites focused on the
dominant historic industrial activity represented in the
study area. The distribution and general function of isolated industrially-related sites are, by inference and direct
observation, relatively clear. Extractive mine sites such
as 41BP238 and 252 contain relict features of mining activity,
specifically concrete foundations which formerly supported
mine hardware. Relict railspur routes can be detected in
various areas within the Prospect. Isolated habitation
structures, both collapsed and standing, are the principal
features at 41BP239 and 254.
Rather than pursue study at spatially isolated features,
a comprehensive view of a discrete period of local history
may be better achieved by long-term preservation and examination of a network of social and industrial systems. All
the various structures and their functional attributes found
at the more isolated sites are represented at the Glenham
site (41BP235). This complex, then, offers the best opportunity to examine both specific features and interacting
systems. The Calvin site (41BP233) also holds potential
value to explaining social organization pertinent to a unique,
or single, community. The value of this site can be fully
e evaluated only by the application of archeological techniques.
Other than those sites occurring within the mining zone
and recommended for mitigative study, (41BP191 and 192), the
three sites recommended herein (41BP240, 235,233) are not within

POWELL BENV

59

the m~n~ng zone and are amenable to alternative plans for
minimizing impact.*
Emphasis on site preservation is primary; the protection
and perpetuation of these cultural loci are the physical
links of continuity and retention of human heritage. At
this time further assessment of these sites from other than
the strictly anthropological or historical viewpoint should
be considered in view of the damage or destruction possible
in the mining operations.

*

Editor's Note:
41BP233 will be affected by the proposed construction of
auxilary facilities and testing of the site was deemed
necessary. Limited testing of the Calvin community was
carried out in the Spring of 1982 and a report is in
preparation.

SUBSURFACE TESTING AND EVALUATION

The purpose of this testing program was to evaluate
the nature and subsurface interpretive potential of the cultural material in sites 41BP191, 192, 218 and 229. In order
to determine if further investigation was warranted these
sites were viewed with respect to the following criteria:
a)
b)
c)

The character of the cultural material both
vertically and horizontally.
The amount of post-depositional disturbance affecting the cultural deposits.
The potential for recovering data on the activities
conducted at the site.

FIELD TECHNIQUES
Techniques employed during this program included
mechanical trenching, hand dug pits, and intensive surface
reconnaissance. Mechanical trenching was performed by a
backhoe supplied with crew by the Lower Colorado River
Authority. Deep (up to 3 m.) trenching was used to expose
the subsurface soil stratigraphy of each site, to define
culture-bearing strata, and to delineate site boundaries.
Hand dug test pits were utilized to control horizontal
and vertical excavation of cultural-bearing strata defined
through backhoe trenching. All fill was screened through
1/4" mesh screen and all cultural material (excepting burned
rock) was collected, recorded and taken to the lab to be
analyzed. Burned rock was stacked beside the pit, counted,
and the total number recorded on the standard test unit excavation form. Excavation was by arbitrary 15 cm. levels in
the units of all four sites since no discernable cultural
stratigraphy was observed.
During the initial surface survey preliminary site
perimeters were delineated. Subsequent intensive site inspection decided placement of the backhoe trenches and hand
dug pits.
SOIL
The sites are in areas characterized by one or more of
the Demona, Axtell or Tabor soil series as described in the
USDA Soil Survey of Bastrop County, Texas (Baker 1979). In
general, these soils are comprised of a solum characterized
by sandy loam upper horizons and mottled sandy clay lower
horizons. Detailed profile descriptions and areal distributions of these series are provided in the USDA Soil Survey

Figure 6

POWELL BENV

65

of Bastrop County, Texas (Baker 1979). Where presumed
applicable, nomenclature of master horizons are extrapolated
from soil profiles described in the published soil survey.
SITES
41BP218
This campsite occupies a sloping sandy terrace along the
western edge of a dense post oak-yaupon woodland bordering an
open pasture. The terrace lies at the confluence of two
tributaries draining westward. During the field survey,
lithic debitage and burned rock fragments were observed in
the deep rills incised into the western slope of the terrace
which has been cleared for ranch road access. In the
northern profile of one of these rills, a hearth-like feature
was partially exposed about 10 cm. below the ground surface.
Additionally, shovel probes had revealed some depth to the
cultural deposit. The testing area is a product of clearing
of the yaupon and post oak for a ranch road; surrounding
dense tree cover precluded any large-scale testing away from
the cleared area (Fig. 6).
Testing Procedures, 41BPZ18
Trenches: Five backhoe trenches were dug (Fig. 7)
revealing a subsurface soil profile similar to that described
for the Dernona series (Baker 1979: 13-15). Trench 1 extends
southward from the downslope end of the site into the site's
interior. The profile of this trench revealed a series of
depositional zones probably produced by the sheetwashing of
material from further upslope. The thickness of each zone
is dependent upon sheetwash velocity and ensuing load
capacity which results in deposition varying from thin, dark
lines of fine texture to deep bands of coarser textured
material. These zones are apparent in both the Al and AZ
horizons. The B horizon is a red and yellow mottled sandy
clay.
Cultural material consisted of fire-cracked rock and a
few chert chips contained in the bioturbated A horizons.
Trench Z is located 6 m. south of trench 1 and extends
upslope in a southerly direction. Its profile is similar to
that of trench 1, except the B horizon was exposed only in
the northern end of the trench at 1.8 m. The southern end
contained a deep AZ horizon to a minimal depth of 3 m.; the
B horizon was not reached in this area. The horizontallyoriented sheetwash depositional lines were present throughout the A horizons.
Trenches 3 and 4 exposed profiles similar to that in
the southern portion of trench 2. Extensive bioturbation of
the A horizons, along with severe trench wall slumpage, made
profiling these trenches impractical. A few fire-cracked
rocks were observed in the mixed A horizons.

SUBSURFACE TESTING

Trench 5, located at the upslope end of the site, had
the expected profile of very narrow Al and AZ horizons with
the B horizon only 60 cm. beneath the surface of the trench.
No cultural material was observed in this trench.
The composite trench profiles show the approximate
relationships of the five trenches (Fig. 8).
Pits: One lxl m. hand dug test pit was placed over a
concentration of four burned rocks exposed in the bank of a
shallow erosional rill. The burned rocks were 17 to 24 cm.
below the surface. No other burned rocks were directly
associated with this group and no former living surface could
be detected in the rill profile. Seven flakes and numerous
small fire-cracked rocks were uncovered in the fill. Excavation ceased at a depth of 30 cm.
The mixed nature of the subsurface horizons gave little
hope for the recovery of any intact cultural features. Due
to the scantiness of the observed cultural material and the
condition of the subsurface horizons, testing was terminated.
The site was mapped showing the placement of trenches and
test pit in the context of the contour layout of the area.
41BP229
The site is located on a low terrace, bounded on the
east and west by small tributaries feeding into a larger
drainage bordering the southern edge of the site. During
surface survey scattered tertiary flakes and burned rock
fragments with localized concentrations were noted. Shovel
probes probes had revealed subsurface presence of burned
rock and flakes occurring in relatively discrete areas of
the site. The terrace had been cleared of trees and had been
used as farmland and pasturage. This site is just east of
41BP191 (Fig. 6).
Testing procedures, 41BP229
Trenches: Three backhoe trenches were placed in spoke1 ike fashion around the edge of the terrace (Fig. g) .
Trench 1 is located at the southern edge of the site
near the major drainage. The soil profile is similar to the
general description of the Tabor series (TfB). FigurelO
illustrates the profile in trench 1. A few fire-cracked
rocks were noted in the upper A horizons but no cultural
strata could be discerned. Rodent burrows were interlaced
in the upper horizons.
Trench 2 is located north and east of trench 1, abutting
the small tributary bordering the east side of the terrace.
The profile description of this trench is similar to the
Axtell (AfC) series. No cultural material was observed in
the trench walls or fill.
Trench 3 is located north and west of trench 1. It is
near the small tributary which borders the west side of the

terrace. Rodent activity was very high in this area making
a detailed profile of the trench impossible. Soil colors
and characteristics indicate this area is within the Tabor
soil series. Of interest was the presence of larger gravels
(Uvalde) at a depth between 26 and 36 inches. No cultural
material was seen.
Pits: Two lx2 m. hand dug test pits were placed on the
site. Test pit 1 is located west of trench 1. This unit
was excavated in two 15 cm. levels. Numerous gopher holes
were encountered. Cultural material in this unit consisted
of four flakes and 43 fire fractured rocks in the first level
and an additional 10 fire fractured rocks in the second
level.
Test pit 2, located west of trench 2, was also excavated
in 15 cm. levels. A concentration of gravels, a few flakes
and burned rocks were uncovered at 13 cm. A total of 23
flakes and chips were removed from this first level. Level
2 exposed the B horizons at a depth of 25 cm. An additional
5 cm. was removed in order to see if the cultural material
continued into the B horizon. It did not. A total of 25
chips and flakes were removed from the upper poriton of the
second level. Although numerous pieces of burned rock were
uncovered in this unit, no concentration or feature could be
defined.
The site was mapped showing the relative positioning of
the trenches and pits along with the contoured landforms on
which the site is located.
41BP192
The site is located on the easterly-trending slope on
the west bank of a shallow drainage (Fig.11). The site was
uncovered by bulldozing of a road to a soil testing site. A
hearth-like feature composed of quartzite, chert and sandstone cobbles and slabs was partially exposed in a shallow
rill originating from the woodland clearance.
Testing Procedures, 41BP192
Trenching: Two backhoe trenches were placed in the
cleared area within the site (Fig. 12). Trench 1 is near the
eastern edge of the site and its soil profile is similar to
the Tabor (TfB) series. Obvious differences notable between
the two profile descriptions are in horizon depths and a few
soil colors (Fig. 13). A few fire-cracked rocks were noticed
in the fill of this trench, however, no cultural level could
be determined.
Trench 2 was placed near the western extremity of the
site. The profile of this trench matches that of the general
Axtell (AfC) soil profile. No cultural material was observed
in either the trench walls or the fill.
Pits: Four hand dug test pits were placed on this site,

Pit 1 was placed over an accumulation of burned rock
exposed in a shallow erosional rill. Removal of the upper
soils revealed the exposed rocks were part of a larger circular concentration. This concentration continued into the
south wall of the pit so an extension was excavated. The
contiguous extension, pit la, is a lxl m. unit directly south
of pit 1. A 5 cm. balk wall was left separating the two pits
to aid in profiling the concentration. The soil was removed
until the concentration was exposed - approximately 20 cm.
below ground level measured from the NW corner of pit 1. An
estimated 90% of the concentration was uncovered in these
two units. The remainder is east of these units but no attempt was made to extend the excavations in that direction.
The concentration was designated Feature 1 and will be described in full later in this report.
Test pit 2 is located to the south and east of trench 2.
This unit was excavated to a depth of 17 cm. to the orangishred B horizon of the Axtell (AfC) series. One flake, one
chip and a number of fire-fractured rocks were the only
cultural material uncovered, and these were mixed throughout
the fill.
Pit 3 is 3 meters west and 3 meters south of the southwest corner of pit la and was excavated to a depth of 30 cm.
This test unit was placed in relation to pits 1 and la to
reveal any activity area associated with Feature 1. Unfortunately, nothing conclusive was uncovered. A total of 8
flakes, 4 chips and 21 burned rock fragments were found mixed
in the fill; there was no evidence of a cultural floor. Excavation was terminated when the first B horizon of the Tabor
(TfB) was encountered.
Feature 1: Feature 1 is a circular burned rock concentration approximately 1 m. in diameter (Fig. 14a). The
northern half of the feature had been disturbeo by many forces,
one of which is the erosional rill which exposed it. Some
of the damage might be attributed to tree clearing. The
southern half was protected from these disturbances by a
deeper soil cover and the presence of a large root (8 cm. in
diam.) which had grown across the feature in an east-west direction. The balk wall which was left in place between pits
1 and la bisects the feature into almost equal northern and
southern halves. The NW section of the feature in pit la
(approximately 1/4 of its entirety) was removed in an attempt
to define the surface on which the feature had been placed.
No discernable surface was observed, however, the two resultant profiles defined the configuration and constituents of
the feature. The northern wall profile (Fig. 14c) illustrates
a slight dipping of the feature towards the center; one edge
is one rock thick and the center, two rocks thick, giving
the feature a plano-convex cross section. The east wall profile (Fig. 14d) defines the same general trend of one rock
thick extremity and two rock thick center. Two soil samples

were taken, one of the fill around and under the rocks removed for the profiles, the other from outside the feature
in the southern end of pit la. Rock type counts in a sample
approximating 25% of the feature provided the following results: 31 quartzite, 15 chert, and 5 ferrugenous sandstone.
The quartzite and chert cobbles were approximately fist-size,
the largest is 10 cm. in diameter.
The feature slopes slightly from north to south. The
cobbles show signs of having been in direct contact with
extreme heat - spalling and pot-lidding shattered the rock
in many cases. The presence of fire-fractured rock with the
fragments still in place suggests an ~n ~~tu use of the
feature. One retouched flake was found lying on the feature
near the NE edge; no other cultural material was found in
direct association.

The site is located on the gently-sloping north terrace
of an unnamed, west-draining tributary of Big Sandy Creek
(Fig.11). The terrace had been cleared of all trees in
historic times and the soil cultivated for a time. It is
presently used as pastureland. Although surface disturbances
were apparent during surface survey, shovel probes had revealed some relatively deep deposits. The site is extensive
and covers approximately 100 m. N-S by 300 m. E-W.
Testing Procedures, 41BP191
The testing of the site incorporated the use of extensive surface reconnaissance, backhoe trenching and hand
excavated pits.
Trenches: Eight backhoe trenches were dug in the site
area (Fig. 15), each at least 1.5 m. deep. Moving from east
to west across the site, two soil types and one variation
were encountered. Trenches 1 through 4 exposed profiles similar to the Axtell (AfC) series; trenches 5 through 7 were the
Axtell (AfC2) variation; and trench 8 was in the Tabor (TfB)
series. Figure 16 shows the subsurface relationships of the
eight trenches and their vertical (elevation) positioning.
Trench 5 is of particular interest because of a layer
of Uvalde gravels which cuts through the A and B horizons of
the Axtell AfC2 series (Fig. 17). Since the soil horizons
are comparable on either side of the gravels, logically the
placement of the gravels predates the present soil development.
The rounded, apparently stream worn gravels ranged to 10 cm.
in diameter. A linear arrangement of fire-cracked rock at
the base of the A horizons was exposed in the trench wall.
This accumulation did not extend back from the exposed edge.
No soil discoloration or charcoal was detected.

Survey: In conjunction with the trenching, an intensive surface reconnaissance was conducted. Two people, 10 m.
apart, transected the site area flagging high density artifact
accumulations and site boundaries. This procedure more
accurately defined the site boundary and served as a basis
for the placement of test pits. Four artifacts were collected
during this survey: one To~tuga-0 dart point, one denticulate
dart point, and two thin biface tips (see artifact descriptions).
Pits: Ten lxl m. hand-dug test pits were placed within
the site boundaries. Each unit was excavated in 15 cm.
levels and all fill screened through 1/4 inch mesh screen.
Test pit 1 is located west of trench 1 and near the
bank of the tributary. Surface indications in this area were
promising, however, the culture bearing horizon was only 20
cm. deep and only a few flakes, chips and burned rock were
found. Three historic ceramic sherds (white porcelain ware)
were uncovered in this unit; these were the total historic
material recovered from the site. No features or distinct
concentrations of material were located in this unit.
Pit 2 is located east of the datum point on the upper
slope portion of the terrace and yielded the greatest amount
of cultural material of any of the test units. Although no
intact cultural zone could be located, two-thirds (66.4%) of
the cultural material was within 15 cm. of the surface. Intense rodent activity was very evident in four tunnels crisscrossing the unit.
Pit 3 is located approximately 80 m. northwest of pit
2. Flakes, chips and burned rock were uncovered, but no
concentration of cultural material was discernable.
Test pit 4 is located 30 m. southwest of datum. The
soil in this area is so deflated that the B horizon was
exposed when the vegetation was cleared from the unit surface.
No cultural material was uncovered.
Test pit 5 is located 170 m. west of datum. Again,
flakes, chips and burned rock were mixed in the A horizons.
No diagnostics were found.
Pit 6 is 150 m. west of datum. This unit was placed
over the location of the denticulate dart point found during
the intensive surface reconnaissance. No features or concentrations were evident in this pit but numerous flakes, chips
and fire-fractured rocks were uncovered.
Test pit 7 is located approximately SO m. northwest of
pit 6. A concentration of burned rock, uncovered at a depth
of 10 cm., occupied over 75% of the pit floor and continued
into the north and east walls. Its outline was generally
circular. A large core was located in the south pit wall at
the same depth as the burned rock. Numerous flakes and chips
were removed from the fill above the concentration.
Test pit 8 was opened directly north of pit 7 to uncover
more of the burned rock concentration. The burned rock was

slightly deeper in this unit (16 to 24 cm.). The northern
edge of the concentration was defined confirming the circular configuration. This concentration was then labeled
Feature 1 (Fig. 18b). Numerous flakes and chips were screened
from the fill above the feature.
Test pit 9 is approximately 6 m. west of datum.
Numerous flakes, chips and burned rock fragments were uncovered; no concentrations or diagnostics were located. The
B horizon was reached at a depth of 16 cm. and excavation
ceased.
Pit 10 is located approximately SO m. northwest of
datum. A few flakes, chips and burned rocks were uncovered
although a marked decrease in their number compared to the
depth of the A horizons (32 cm.) was noted.
The site was mapped showing the location of the trenches
and pits.
Feature 1: Feature 1, as already identified, was partially uncovered in test pits 7 and 8. The feature is a
circular concentration of burned rocks. With the use of a
probe, the eastern edge of the feature was defined approximately SO cm. east of the excavated units (Fig. 18a), providing a l.S m. diameter for the feature. That portion of
the feature exposed in pit 8 was removed in order to profile
the feature in both east-west and north-south cross sections.
These profiles (Figs. 18c,d) reveal the feature to consist of
from two to three layers of stone. No distinct living surface or floor could be seen although the feature is located
just above the transition between the A and B horizons. One
rodent tunnel can be seen cutting through the feature (Fig.
18c). Overall, the exposed portion of the feature seems
fairly intact. The perimenter at the northern edge is a
little more loosely defined. A lithology, conducted during
profiling, indicated this sample of a little more than 1/4
of the feature contained 104 chert cobbles, 34 quartzite
and 1 ferrugenous sandstone. The average cobble was 9 cm. x
7 cm. x 6 cm.; the largest measured lS cm. x 10 cm. x 10 cm.
No charcoal, other than a few tiny flecks, was found, however,
the presence of in ¢itu fire-fracturing supports the assumption
that the feature is relatively intact. Also, the encasement
of the feature in one continuous matrix supports the integrity of the feature rather than its settling on a lower, more
compact horizon.
Artifact Descriptions
A total of S82 lithic items were recovered from the
testing program of site 41BP191. The majority of this material
is debitage. Table 3 presents the classification of the
debitage into primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes; and
chips. Each category, with the exception of the chips, has
been further divided into a lipped and nonlipped category to
determine if any of the trends towards the usage of soft
hammer percussion could be detected. The small number of

SUBSURFACE TESTING

primary flakes suggests that initial core reduction was
accomplished previous to transporting the material to the
site. The large number of tertiary flakes signifies the
reduction of materials into, or close to, finished form.
Also, the trend toward increased occurrence of lipped flakess
as shown in Table 4 indicates the final stages of reduction.
Cores: Seven cores were collected from subsurface
test pits. These were divided into chunks, biface cores and
multidirectional cores.
The chunk category is comprised of four specimens.
These are characterized by numerous multidirectional flake
scars but on which only a portion of the entire negative scar
is present. These are probably fragments from a larger core
which fractured during reduction. All four specimens were
removed from Pit 2: three from level 1 and one from level 2.
Two biface cores were collected. These are characterized by flake scars initiating along the same edge but on
opposite faces - hence the term bifacial. One such specimen
was found in association with Feature J (Pit 7), the second
came from test Pit 6, level 1 (Fig. 19f).
One multidirectional core was uncovered during testing.
It is characterized by the presence of flake scars signifying the removal of flakes in different directions from any
number of surfaces of the core. This one specimen was uncovered in test Pit 6, level 1.
Unifacially Trimmed Flakes: Eleven trimmed flakes were
uncovered during the testing of 41BP191 and are divided into
groups on the basis of trimmed edge shape and face of scarring.
Five specimens are classed as concave dorsal, defined
as having a concave edge shape with the retouch on the dorsal
surface. Three specimens are from Pit 2, level 1, and two
from Pit 9.
Four specimens are of the convex dorsal group characterized by the convex shape of the dorsally trimmed edge.
All four specimens are from test Pit 2, level 1.
One specimen, from Pit 2, level 1, has been classified
as concave ventral. Trimming is located on the ventral surface of the flake and the edge outline is concave.
A specimen from test Pit 2, level 2, has two trimmed
edges, one is trimmed on the ventral surface and the other on
the dorsal surface. Both edges are straight.
Bifaces: This broad category contains five specimens
from 41BP191 which are divided into two groups: thin biface
tips and projectile points.
Three thin biface tips were collected - two are surface
finds and the third was removed from test Pit 2, level 1.
All three are the triangular tips formed by the convergence
of two bifacially flaked lateral edges. Since all three are
only a fragment of the entire tool, no definite function can
be assumed (Fig. 19a,b,c).
Two projectile points were removed from the surface of
the site. One point is similar to the dart point type called

(Suhm and Jelks 1962: 249). This specimen is triangular in shape with straight lateral edges and base. Both
lateral edges are steeply bevelled on the right edge of each
surface giving the projectile a rhombic cross section. The
base has been thinned. This specimen of brown and tan chert
is 4.9 cm. long, 3.0 cm. wide and 0.7 cm. thick (Fig. 19d).
The second projectile is an unclassed dart point style.
It exhibits deep assymetrical denticulates on the lateral
edges and base. It possessed barbs, however both of these
are now missing. The body is lanceolate in shape with convex
lateral edges; it is lenticular in cross section and the
shoulders are assymetrically placed. The edges of the base
expand slightly and the base is straight. The material from
which this specimen is made is a translucent light tan chert.
It is 7.9 cm. long, 3.1 cm. wide (incomplete), and 0.5 cm.
thick (Fig. 19e) .

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this testing program was to evaluate
the nature and subsurface potential of the cultural materials
in sites 41BP191, 192, 218 and 229. In order to determine
if further investigations are warranted, certain criteria
were developed and each site was viewed according to the
following:
a) the character of the cultural material, both
vertically and horizontally;
b) the amount of post-depositional disturbance affecting the cultural deposits;
c) the potential for recovering data on activities
conducted at the site.
Testing of sites 41BP218 and 229 revealed little archeologically significant material. Both sites are very shallow,
sparse lithic scatters and no features or diagnostic artifacts were uncovered. Bioturbation had so effectively mixed
the cultural materials throughout the A horizons that no
intact cultural features or strata could be located and the
artifact yield was very low.
Site 41BP192 also evidences the effects of bioturbation,
however, it is of less consequence than that observed at 41BP218 and 229. Although little cultural material was uncovered, a fairly intact hearth/oven was located (Fig. 14b).
The presence of this intact feature indicates the potential
for other undisturbed cultural matial.
Site 41BP191 has emerged as having the potential to
supply solid data on the use of upland sites by aboriginal
populations. The site is located in an upland zone next to
a small tributary. Outcrops of Uvalde gravels occur on the
slopes around the area. Lithic reduction is the most evident
activity and is the easiest to recognize across the surface
of the site. The percentage of primary, secondary and ter-

90

SUBSURFACE TESTING

tiary flakes reveals a trend toward the secondary reduction,
a trend further supported by the presence of finished tool
forms. The small number of primary flakes suggests that
most primary reduction of lithic materials was conducted
prior to transporting the material to the site. The deep,
sandy horizons on the eastern part of the site contain a
dense accumulation of cultural material. The presence of
numerous trimmed flakes from this area indicates processing
of another material in addition to the lithics; this resource
is not yet identified. The west side of the site contains
one intact feature - a circular hearth/oven - and numerous
burned rocks across the rest of the site suggest the presence
of other such cooking areas. The presence of a To~tuga~
dart point suggests one occupation between 5000 and 4000
years ago (Weir 1976: 51; Prewitt 1981: 79). Whether other
occupations are represented is a subject for further study.
Although sites with similar burned rock features have been
reported to the north (Skelton and Freeman 1979; Moore 1978;
Prewitt 1974; Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967), no definitive
relationships between the upland resources and this feature
type have been established. 41BP191 has the potential to
provide sufficient data to develop an interpretation of
cultural exploitation perhaps augmented by the recovery of
temporally diagnostic artifacts.

ADDITIONAL SURVEY ON THE POWELL BEND LIGNITE PROSPECT

At the request of the Lower Colorado River Authority,
a survey of 80.5 acres additional to the original 1200-acre
Powell Bend Prospect was conducted by the Texas Archeological
Survey. Carried out under Antiquities Permit 291, issued to
the LCRA by the Texas Historical Commission, the field work
was completed on June 2, 1982. The survey plot lies in a
strip varying in width between 123 m. and 150 m. on the northeast side of the MK&T railroad tracks bordering the main
prospect to the northeast (Fig. 20). Staff archeologists
David G. Robinson and Leland C. Bement conducted the field
work using the pedestrian transect procedure. The plot was
thoroughly surveyed for cultural resources in its entirety.
Sites and finds were recorded in detail, photographs were
taken, and site locations were mapped on aerial photographs.
The survey located the remains of two historic homesteads
and various prehistoric isolated finds. One historic locale
consists of a corral measuring 50 by 60 ft., constructed of
branches and railroad ties with modern barbed wire and wire
nails, and a brick alignment and scattered bricks of a house
removed several years ago by James Gould (James Gould, personal
communication). Clumps of irises grow in patterns suggestive
of beds planted along the outside of the house. From these
clumps and an alignment of at least five bricks which may have
lined the flower bed, the house may have measured about 20 ft.
square. Artifacts are strewn about the farmstead in variable
densities, but no artifact scatter dense enough to be called
a trash heap was identified. Artifacts observed included
several reddish-brown and cream-colored bricks, one with the
impressed label "T.F.E. Co."; clear and colored jar, bottle
and window glass, most notably a fragment of a red glass vase
and a glass jar lid lining; wire; nails; ceramics including
ironstone ware, transferware, and stoneware; enamelware; a
rubber shoe heel; and a plastic button. The artifact assemblage lacked any items diagnostic of periods earlier than
fifty years before the present; manganese glass was lacking
on the site and all glass bottle necks had screw tops.
The remains of a second house were found near a large
stock tank in the central portion of the study area. The house
had been entirely obliterated in the construction of the tank
leaving fewer remains than were found at the first homestead.
Materials observed suggest an even later date than the first
house. Composition construction panels and plastic items
serve as the recent diagnostics, and bricks, lumber, and tar
paper roofing shingles were observed also. Trash debris such
as broken crockery, glass and metal was almost entirely lacking.

Prehistoric finds included one chert core and three chert
flakes. The core and one flake were found near a cut bank
below a modern stock tank. The cut bank was examined carefully
for additional cultural material or features but none were
located. The other two flakes were found in isolated contexts,
one accompanied by fragments of burned rock on an agricultural
terrace in the northern portion of the survey plot. Burned rock
and possibly culturally produced chert flakes were found on an
abandoned railroad spur on the southern portion of the survey
plot. As these finds lie on ground disturbed by modern
surface modifications, their findspots cannot be considered
as prehistoric cultural sites which are defined as loci of
past human activity.
Perhaps the most important observation of the survey
involves outcrops of Uvalde gravels on the survey plot.
Two extensive scatters of these large chert, quartzite,
and silicified wood gravels were found on the plot, one
near the southern end of the area and one on the gravel
portion of the plot. What is remarkable about the gravel
scatters is that with the exception of a single chert flake
on the central scatter, the outcrops lie devoid of any indication of prehistoric cultural activity. This near-pristine
state contrasts sharply with other gravel scatters on the
Powell Bend Prospect. Other scatters at the same elevation,
distance from water, orientation and exposure as the scatters
on the additional survey area show extensive prehistoric
quarrying activities. Accurate, well-reasoned interpretations
of this differential prehistoric use of important resource zones
in a fairly small area should be major goals of future prehistoric research in Bastrop County.
The historic resources on the survey plot are insignificant
and require no further investigation or protective measures.
The houses fail to date assuredly to a period earlier than fifty
years ago, but within their likely period of construction the
title to the land on which they sat was held by J.L. Wilbarger
(Bastrop County 1904), a descendant of Josiah Pugh Wilbarger,
one of the original settlers of the Little Colony in Bastrop
County, initiated by Stephen F. Austin. This ownership is of
minor historical note; otherwise, the remains lack value as
unique local or regional architectural types. The prehistoric
resouces likewise retain little significance due to their lack
of intrinsic information content and the disturbed surfaces
upon which they were found. Thus, investigations of prehistoric
cultural resources on the survey plot are considered unwarranted.
