Robert A. Wright
The History of Tree Ring Dating in the American
Southwest
Robert A. Wright
West Texas A&M University
Abstract
Dendroarchaeology is a term used for the investigation and study of vegetation remains, old buildings,
artifacts, furniture, art and musical instruments using the techniques of dendrochronology (tree-ring dating). It
refers to dendrochronological research of wood from the past regardless of its current physical context (in or
above the soil). This presentation will examine the history, methodology, and techniques of tree ring dating
using case studies from the American Southwest. Specific topics examined include site selection, field and
laboratory techniques, dendroclimatology, calibrating the CO² clock, dendroarchaeology at Pueblo Bonito, and
historical archaeology at Johnny Ward’s Ranch.

Fiber Spinning Technology on
the Southern High Plains

By Scott D. Brosowske and Stacy Brown

W

hen one thinks of prehistoric textiles in the
Americas, the Southern Plains rarely come to mind.
There are several reasons for this. First, the materials
most commonly used to make these items, either plant
or animal based, generally do not preserve well in open
sites of the region. Second, while horticultural societies of the Southwest developed a strong weaving tradition that only flourished with the introduction of cotton
and sheep, similar trends are not well documented
among neighboring peoples of the Plains. Even so, as
we will discuss in this article, there is direct and
indirect evidence that indicate that prehistoric and
historic peoples of the Southern Plains did produce
plant and animal cordage by spinning.
Spinning is the process of combining plant fibers or
animal hair into yarn or cordage. In its simplest form,
this can be accomplished by taking the chosen material and twisting it in between your hands or by rolling
the material on your thigh with your hand. The material
will twist into a cord or yarn that is thicker, stronger, and
more abrasion resistant than unspun fibers. While
effective, the length of the yarn or cordage produced by
this method is often limited to the length of the
spinner’s arm. Faced with this problem, people
throughout the world progressed to the next step in the
evolution of spinning.

By using a spindle combined with a weight or whorl,
longer, continuous strands were efficiently spun by
hand (Figure 1). The spindle whorl is used by attaching
a mass of animal hair or wool or plant fibers to the end
of the spindle and rotating or
spinning the spindle. The
process of spinning allows
the strands of the material to
be tightly twisted and drawn
out into a length of yarn or
cordage. The use of a whorl
or weight on the bottom end
of the spindle increases the
inertia of the device enabling
the spindle to spin for a
greater length of time as it
twists the fibers together. In
other words, the whorl serves
as a flywheel. As the length
of the cordage or yarn
increases, the spindle also
serves as a gathering point
for the spun material by
wrapping it around itself.

Page 4
Numerous studies have examined in detail the use of
spindle whorls (e.g., Barber 1991; Franquemont 2009;
Freer-Waters 2011; Loughran-Delahunt 1996; Neff 2001;
Teague 1998). These studies provide excellent insight
into the physics underlying spindle whorl use and how
different sizes of whorls are typically associated with
the spinning of specific types of raw materials.
Loughran-Delahunt (1996) determined that the inertia
for a spinning disc can be determined by the following
formula: I = 1/2MR², where I is the moment of inertia, M
is the mass of the disc, and R is the radius of the disc. A
higher inertia is more valuable for spinning due to its
ability to produce and maintain speed. Whorls with a
larger radius spin slower, but for a longer period of time
than
a
whorl
with
a
smaller
radius.
Loughran-Delahunt’s (1996:54-57) conclusions support
other studies that assert that larger diameter spindle
whorls were often used for spinning coarse plant fibers
and animal hair (i.e., wool). Whereas, smaller diameter
whorls were typically associated with spinning fine
plant fibers or animal hair to produce tightly wound,
small diameter yarns.
Direct evidence for spinning on the Southern Plains
comes from a few dry rockshelters or caves in the
region. Archaeologists working at Curry Cave (41RD94)
in Randall County, Texas and Kenton Caves in Cimarron
County, Oklahoma recovered numerous artifacts
produced by spinning and weaving. At Curry Cave, for
instance, these items included sandals, matting,
basketry, and cordage or yarn produced from plant
fibers and animal hair (see Brosowske 2011). These
items are believed to date to the Middle Ceramic period
(A.D. 1250-1500). Although spinning technology does
not appear to be widespread in the region because the
products produced by spinning are usually not
preserved in open air sites, judging from sites, such as
Curry Cave and Kenton Caves, it is highly probable that
it was much more common than the archaeological
record indicates.

That some of the spinning traditions survived into the
historic period among Plains societies is indicated by a
short account written by Alphonso Wetmore as he
crossed the plains on the Santa Fe Trail in 1828. This
account documents Hispanic members of this caravan
“spinning rope yarn out of the foretops of buffalo”
(Lavender 1972:70). This report indicates that wool
from the head and shoulders of the buffalo could be
fashioned into a serviceable yarn or cordage. That the
production of yarn or rope made of buffalo wool was
not limited to Puebloan societies is demonstrated by
the Kiowa and other Plains societies who used bison
yarn for tying closed a number of different types of
bags (Coverdale 2012, personal communication). With
this being said, the spinning of bison wool and plant
fibers, such as yucca, among Plains societies during the
historic period appears to have been accomplished by
hand and without the use of spindle whorls.
Possible evidence for spinning, albeit indirect, comes
from artifacts generally referred to as spindle whorls
recovered at prehistoric sites of the region. These items
are generally circular, flat, and have been fashioned out
of broken pottery sherds or local stone. These have
been recovered at most Middle Ceramic period occupation sites throughout Oklahoma and Texas. Recently,
five spindle whorls produced from broken sherds and
recovered from Alibates Ruin 28 were examined as a
part of this study. All of these specimens were on
display at the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
(Figure 2). Unfortunately, because these whorls were
attached to a display board, catalog numbers and
weights could not be recorded for these items. These
items were assigned specimen numbers one to five
(Table 1). These items ranged in diameter from about
41 mm to 69 mm. The thicknesses varied from 4.2 mm
to 8.6 mm. There was also a great deal of variation in
the diameter of spindle whorl holes, with the smallest
being 2.8 mm and largest nearly 10.0 mm.

Page 5
As noted above, these specimens were produced
from broken sherds. Given the original diameter of the
portion of the ceramic vessel from which they were
made, some of these items were nearly flat, while
others were notably concave. Although the outlines of
these whorls were all roughly circular, some were quite
symmetrical and others were not. The outlines of
these specimens were produced by snapping the
edges to form a circular shape. The more symmetrical
whorls were further modified by grinding, perhaps with
a sandstone pebble. Because these sherds were tempered with fine sand, the holes in these whorls were
likely drilled quite easily. Experiments conducted as a
part of this study indicated that holes can be drilled
through a sherd 8 mm thick in a matter of a few minutes with an unhafted chipped stone drill. This was
accomplished by drilling halfway through the sherd
from one side, flipping the sherd over, and finishing the
hole from the other side.

Figure 2 Ceramic Spindle Whorls Discussed in Text

Four additional artifacts from Alibates Ruin 28, which
may or may not represent unfinished spindle whorls,
were also examined (Table 1). These items included a
single circular clay disc manufactured from a broken
sherd and three sandstone discs. The clay disc was
similar in all respects to the spindle whorls described
above, but lacked a drilled hole. As such, while this
specimen could represent a spindle whorl blank, it
could also be a gaming piece or some other item. The
sandstone discs examined were obviously shaped by
grinding and also lacked holes. The latter specimens
were much thicker and heavier than the clay spindle
whorls discussed earlier. As such, these items may not

represent spindle whorl preforms. Nonetheless, they
are included here for comparative purposes.

Clay and Sandstone Disc from Alibates Ruin 28

In closing, this brief study has examined spinning
technologies as a means for producing cordage and
yarns. Archaeological evidence from dry caves and
rockshelters of the Southern High Plains suggest that
spun yarns and cordage may have been widespread
throughout the region during the prehistoric era. Possible evidence for spinning in the form of spindle
whorls is widespread throughout the Southern High
Plains during the Middle and Late Ceramic periods
(A.D. 1250-1650). The types and sizes of spindle
whorls examined in this study are likely representative
of the range present in the region. The types present,
if used for spinning, suggest that they were used for
manufacturing small diameter yarn or cordage. The
absence of large diameter and weight whorls suggest
that the larger diameter cordage produced from coarse
plant fibers present sites of the region were likely
manufactured by hand and not with spindle whorls.
The production of yarns and cordage among equestrian societies during the historic period is documented, but appears to have been less widespread
than previously and did not include the use of spindle
whorls. Although unknown, this apparent decrease in
spinning may have been related to increased mobility,
the lack of ceramic production or some other factor.

SOUTHWESTERN FEDERATION OF
ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETIES SYMPOSIUM
April 13th and 14th, 2012
Iraan Civic Center
Irran, Texas

The Iraan Archeology Society (IAS) is hosting this year’s SWFAS Symposium and other planed activities for this
weekend, which we hope will be an “Old Fashioned Camp Meeting”. Registration fee is $10.00 per person.
Because Iraan is located so far south of the other member societies, we want to attempt to make it easier for
everyone to arrive early and stay late by providing a place to stay the night before and the evening after the planned
paper presentations on Saturday, April 14th.
The IAS will provide free tent camping and recreational vehicle parking on Friday, April 13th and Saturday
April 14th in the Pecos County Park (located on west edge of Iraan). This camping is within 100 yards of the Iraan
Civic Center where the symposium papers are to be presented. Electricity outlets are located on the curbside camping
sites with many nearby water faucets within water hose distance. Two restrooms are located in the park (one of these
has both women’s and men’s shower rooms). Those wishing to have full RV hookups can get a space in the Iraan
City RV Park for only $12.00 per night. A free dump station is also located in this city park which is only ¼ mile
from the free camping area. Those not wishing to camp out can find motels in Iraan, Ozona, Rankin, McCamey and
Fort Stockton (as well as some Bed & Breakfast facilities in or near Iraan). All of those out of town motels are from
25 to 60 miles away.
Because of a limited amount of open restaurants in town on weekends, the IAS will provide a free stew and
cornbread and green chile supper (cooked by a real Chuck Wagon) the evening of Friday, April 13th for both campers
and motel arrivals. This will take place in the Civic Center building starting at 5:00 PM until (?). No one should go
hungry on the night of arrival.
For lunch on Saturday, April 14th complimentary homemade sandwiches, chips and drinks will be provided
by IAS. This will be a good time to get involved with the Silent Auction activities and a visit to the Iraan Museum.
The evening meal on Saturday will again be prepared by the Chuck Wagon crew and will be paid for by
donations from the participants. This activity will take place behind the Civic Center (and near the camping site).
Field trips are planned for mid-afternoon Saturday and early Sunday morning to nearby sites in Pecos County.
The field trip Sunday will end early enough for everyone to return to your communities on Sunday afternoon.
A brief summary of the above discussed items:
Friday, April 13th – 12:00 noon until ? – Campout in County Park near Civic Center or get motel rooms. Meal
prepared by Chuck Wagon is provided for all arrivals.
Saturday, April 14th – Symposium paper presentation 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM in Civic Center. Open Silent Auction,
start registration and have coffee and donuts at 8:00 AM. Field trip to mortar hole and midden site 3:30 to 5:00 PM.
Chuck Wagon cookout in park will follow.
Sunday, April 15th – 9:00 AM go to rock shelter 41PC23 near Iraan that was excavated by the University of Texas in
the 1930’s and found to be a major archeology site. Some very faint rock art is still located inside this very large
shelter.
