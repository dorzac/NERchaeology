MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the months of July and August 2017, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the portions of Enterprise Crude
Pipeline LLC’s (Enterprise) proposed Loving to Midland pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that are
located on public land in southwestern Martin County and north-central Midland County, Texas
(Project Area). The development of the pipeline ROW will be privately funded and will not
require any federal permitting or coordination. However, portions of the proposed ROW cross
land owned by the City of Midland. Because this is public property, the portion of the proposed
ROW on the City of Midland property falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural
resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Enterprise in compliance with the ACT. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project
Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse
impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs). The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit number 8095.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 106.0 miles (170.6 kilometers [km]) long by
100.0 feet (30.5 meters [m]) wide, with a total area of approximately 1,284.8 acres. However,
the Project Area consists of only the segments of the proposed ROW on the property owned by
the City of Midland. The original route across the City of Midland property measured
approximately 2.4 miles (3.7 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of
approximately 29.1 acres. A subsequent reroute of this alignment shifted the proposed ROW to
the northwest and northeast, resulting in a route across the City of Midland property that
measured approximately 5.2 miles (8.4 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a new total
area of approximately 63.0 acres.
The cultural resources survey of the original alignment of the Project Area resulted in
entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the original
alignment of the Project Area or within any of the 40 excavated shovel tests.
The cultural resources investigations conducted along the rerouted alignment of the
Project Area resulted in the formal documentation of Hughes’ Site 1, which he noted in 1985
during an earlier assessment of the property containing the rerouted alignment of the Project

Area. This site, 41MT78, is technically located just outside of the limits of the current Project
Area and will not be impacted. However, Horizon elected to formally document it due to its
relative proximity to the Project Area. It consists of sparse and diffuse scatter of burned caliche
pebbles within a plowed agricultural field. No other cultural materials aside from burned caliche
were observed at this location. Hughes’ Site 2 and Site 3 are located a considerable distance
away from the current Project Area. As such, they were not reassessed or formally
documented.
Based on the negative survey results along the original and rerouted alignments of the
Project Area, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed Loving to Midland
pipeline ROW across property owned by the City of Midland will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Enterprise be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the
portions of Enterprise Crude Pipeline LLC’s (Enterprise) proposed Loving to Midland pipeline
right-of-way (ROW) that are located on public land in southwestern Martin County and northcentral Midland County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1-1 through 1-3). The development of the
pipeline ROW will be privately funded and will not require any federal permitting or coordination.
However, portions of the proposed ROW cross land owned by the City of Midland. Because this
is public property, the portions of the proposed ROW on the City of Midland property fall under
the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc.
(Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of
Enterprise in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the
project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources investigations were
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 8095.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 106.0 miles (170.6 kilometers [km]) long by
100.0 feet (30.5 meters [m]) wide, with a total area of approximately 1,284.8 acres (see Figure
1-1). However, the Project Area consists of only the segments of the proposed ROW on the
property owned by the City of Midland (see Figures 1-2 and 1-3). The original route across the
City of Midland property measured approximately 2.4 miles (3.7 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
wide, with a total area of approximately 29.1 acres. A subsequent reroute of this alignment
shifted the proposed ROW to the northwest and northeast, resulting in a route across the City of
Midland property that measured approximately 5.2 miles (8.4 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
wide, with a new total area of approximately 63.0 acres.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
K. Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s Principal
Investigator, while Jacob Lyons, Jared Wiersema, Stephanie Mueller, and Benjamin Johnson
(Horizon archeological technicians) conducted the field investigations.

Horizon conducted the survey of the original alignment of the Project Area on 10 July
2017 and the survey of the rerouted alignment on 30 and 31 August 2017. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the Project Area. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the original
alignment of the Project Area totaled 2.4 miles (3.7 km) in length, a minimum of 37 shovel tests
were necessary in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 40 shovel tests along the original alignment of the Project Area. The
rerouted alignment of the Project Area totaled 5.2 miles (8.4 km) in length and required a
minimum of 84 shovel tests to meet the TSMASS. Horizon fell just short of the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 81 shovel tests along the rerouted alignment of the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the original alignment of the Project Area resulted in
entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the original
alignment of the Project Area or within any of the 40 excavated shovel tests.
The cultural resources investigations conducted along the rerouted alignment of the
Project Area resulted in the formal documentation of Hughes’ Site 1, which he noted in 1985
during an earlier assessment of the property containing the rerouted alignment of the Project
Area. This site, 41MT78, is technically located just outside of the limits of the current Project
Area and will not be impacted. However, Horizon elected to formally document it due to its
relative proximity to the Project Area. It consists of sparse and diffuse scatter of burned caliche
pebbles within a plowed agricultural field. No other cultural materials aside from burned caliche
were observed at this location. Hughes’ Site 2 and Site 3 are located a considerable distance
away from the current Project Area. As such, they were not reassessed or formally
documented.
Based on the negative survey results along the original and rerouted alignments of the
Project Area, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed Loving to Midland
pipeline ROW across property owned by the City of Midland will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Enterprise be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that
any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed pipeline ROW,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

Enterprise’s proposed Loving to Midland pipeline ROW is located in Loving, Winkler,
Ector, Anderson, Midland, and Martin counties, Texas. It initiates at an existing facility in Loving
County and extends northeasterly to a storage facility near Midland, Texas. It can be found on
the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Lindley Ranch, Rudd Draw, Cheyenne Draw SW,
Cheyenne Draw SE, Wink North, Kermit, Vesrue, Notrees NW, Notrees, Turnbaugh Corner,
Goldsmith, North Cowden, Gardendale, Hackberry Lake, Northwest Midland, and Northeast
Midland, Texas topographic quadrangle maps (see Figure 1-1).
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 106.0 miles (170.6 km) long by 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 1,284.8 acres (see Figure 1-1). However, the
Project Area consists of only the segments of the proposed ROW on the property owned by the
City of Midland (see Figures 1-2 and 1-3). The original route across the City of Midland property
measured approximately 2.4 miles (3.7 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of
approximately 29.1 acres. A subsequent reroute of this alignment shifted the proposed ROW to
the northwest and northeast, resulting in a route across the City of Midland property that
measured approximately 5.2 miles (8.4 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a new total
area of approximately 63.0 acres. These 2 alignments of the proposed ROW are both located
just north of Midland in southwestern Martin County and north-central Midland County, Texas.
Representative images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resources survey are
presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located just north of Midland on the Midland and Martin county line in
far West Texas. It is situated within an area of gently undulating desert hills scattered with playa
basins (see Figure 1-1). Elevations within the Project Area range from 2790.0 to 2850.0 feet
(850.4 to 868.7 m) above mean sea level. Hydrologically, Midland and Martin counties drain
into 4 watersheds: Mustang Draw, Johnson Draw, Sulphur Springs Draw, and the Middle
Concho River (EPA 2017). No obvious drainages or tributaries are located near the current
Project Area, although several large playa basins are in its vicinity.

CLIMATE

The climate of Midland and Martin counties is semiarid. Winters are mild, with an
average temperature of 46.2 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an
average temperature of 94.5°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 14.0 inches
(35.6 centimeters [cm]), with roughly 74% of it falling between May and October (NRCS 1973).

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all of
Trans-Pecos Texas except the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950). Blair (1950) notes that
portions of Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now
drained by the Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the
Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, the Project Area is situated on geologic formations composed
of sand sheet and caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant communities
dominate the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa margins, gypsum
land, and desert shrubland. The dominant species associated with the saline flats and alkaline
playa margins plant community include Atriplex canescens (fourwing saltbush), Suaeda spp.
(seepweed), Salicornia spp. (pickleweed), and Sporobolus airoides (alkali sacaton). The
dominant species associated with the gypsum land plant community include Bouteloua
breviseta (gypsum grama), Mentzelia spp. (blazingstar), and Ephedra torreyana (Torrey’s
jointfir). The dominant species associated with the desert shrubland plant community include
Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), Flourensia cernua (American tarwort), Yucca spp. (yucca),
Artemisia filifolia (sand sagebrush), Acacia rigidula (blackbrush acacia), Cylindropuntia
leptocaulis (Christmas cactus), Agave lechuguilla (lechuguilla), and Leucophyllum frutescens
(cenizo) (Griffith et al. 2007).

SOILS

A total of 9 soil types are mapped within the boundaries of the Project Area. These soils
are presented in Table 2-1 (NRCS 1973 and 1974) and in Figure 2-5.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8,500 B.P.),
Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic period is
further subdivided into Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), Middle Archaic (6000 to 3500 B.P.),
and Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison, are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, also were likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are hypothesized to have been low and probably
consisted of small family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the
period may suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band
aggregation for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in
upland tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and
Folsom points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the
later span of the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locations and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence
strategies in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

climates. Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy,
Hardin, and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC I (1250 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow as
well as ceramics in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continued to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas)
online database indicated the presence of 1 previously recorded archeological site within a 1.0mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC 2017), while a review of the National Park
Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated
the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS
2017). The previously recorded archeological site and its distance from the Project Area are
summarized in Table 4-1 below, while its location relative to the Project Area is presented in
Figure 4-1. Based on the locations of mapped cultural resources on the Atlas database, no
documented cultural resources, including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or
immediately adjacent to the Project Area.

According to the Atlas database, the portions of the proposed ROW on public land
extend along the edges and through a previous block acreage survey area that was assessed in
1985 for a then-proposed airport project that required permitting with the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA). As no archeological sites are mapped within this block on the Atlas
database, it was assumed that the prior survey produced negative results. However, with the
assistance of staff at the THC, Horizon was able to obtain a copy of the letter report produced in
1985 for these investigations (Hughes 1985). This letter report indicated that 3 sparse
prehistoric campsites (Sites 1, 2, and 3) were observed on the edges of 3 playa basins on the
property (see Figure 4-1). However, it does not appear that any of them were ever formally
recorded and assigned trinomials.

Proposed Loving to Midland Pipeline ROW on Public Land in Midland and Martin Counties, Texas

Site 1 is described as being located on a slope to the west and southwest of a very small
playa basin, across a north-south road in a cotton field (see Figure 4-1). It was evidenced by a
light scatter of burned caliche and 1 Edwards chert flake within an area of cultivated blowsand.
This scatter measured approximately 164.0 feet (50.0 m) in diameter. Hughes (1985) inferred
the scatter to represent a brief campsite occupied by a small group of natives.
Site 2 is described as being located on the southeastern slope of the larger of 2 paired
playa basins (see Figure 4-1). The archeologist noted a few pieces of burned caliche and 1
Edwards chert flake within an area covering roughly 32.8 feet (10.0 m) in diameter. Hughes
(1985) inferred the scatter to represent a very brief camp by a small group of natives.
Site 3 is described as being located on the northwestern edge of the smaller of the 2
paired playa basins, north of an east-west road that crosses the northern portion of the basin
(see Figure 4-1). Hughes (1985) observed occasional pieces of burned caliche within heavily
disturbed contexts over an area covering approximately 98.4 feet (30.0 m) in diameter. He also
noted a palm-sized biface of Edwards chert and a crudely flaked quartzite uniface. This site
was also inferred to be a limited-use campsite.
All 3 of these sites were noted as being heavily disturbed by plowing and/or brushgrubbing. Due to their sparse and heavily disturbed nature, Hughes (1985) indicated that none
of the 3 sites appeared to merit further investigation or protective measures.
In addition to the 3 sites on the fringes of the playa basins on the property, Hughes
(1985) concluded his letter by indicating that a prairie dog town located in the southern and
western edges of the floor of the larger of the 2 paired playa basins contains burrows that may
have penetrated a Pleistocene pond deposit based on the presence of whitish sediment
(caliche?) within the spoil mounds (see Figure 4-1). Within one of these mounds, Hughes
(1985) observed a “mineralized fragment of a cervical vertebra of a fossil bison.” Hughes
(1985) felt that the fossil fragment had at least some potential to represent a PaleoIndian bison
kill site, and therefore recommended archeological monitoring efforts if any impacts to the playa
basin floor were ever proposed.
However, if the fossil fragment was excavated from the
underlying caliche sediments of the area by the burrowing prairie dogs, it also has the potential
to represent a paleontological specimen that predates human occupations within the region.

4.2

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are
often found in proximity to playa lake beds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the
Project Area in proximity to several playa basins, in conjunction with the presence of 3
unrecorded prehistoric sites noted by Hughes (1985) on the property, it was Horizon’s opinion
prior to the field efforts that there existed a high potential for prehistoric cultural deposits within
the Project Area. In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate
proximity to the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle suggested a decreased
potential for historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the
boundaries of the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive survey of the
original alignment of the Project Area on 10 July 2017 and the survey of the rerouted alignment
on 30 and 31 August 2017. Survey efforts entailed surface inspection and subsurface shovel
testing across the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum 16 shovel tests per mile for
linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the original alignment of the
Project Area totaled 2.4 miles (3.7 km) in length, a minimum of 37 shovel tests were necessary
within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS
by excavating a total of 40 shovel tests within the original alignment of the Project Area. The
rerouted alignment of the Project Area totaled 5.2 miles (8.4 km) in length and required a
minimum of 84 shovel tests to meet the TSMASS. Horizon fell just short of the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 81 shovel tests along the rerouted alignment of the Project Area. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests, and
cultural material observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were completed for every
shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts
encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site forms were to be
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated
site forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 5-1. Shovel test data
are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS

The cultural resources investigations along the original alignment of the Project Area
resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on this surface of this
alignment or within any of the 40 excavated shovel tests.
The cultural resources investigations conducted along the rerouted alignment of the
Project Area resulted in the formal documentation of Hughes’ Site 1, which he noted in 1985
during an earlier assessment of the property containing the rerouted alignment of the Project
Area. This site, 41MT78, is technically located just outside of the limits of the current Project
Area and will not be impacted. However, Horizon elected to formally document it due to its
relative proximity to the Project Area. It is detailed below.
Based on his descriptions, the inferred locations of Hughes’ (1985) Site 2 and Site 3, as
well as the prairie dog town where he observed a fragment of fossilized bison vertebra, are all
located between 1300.0 and 1700.0 feet (396.2 and 518.2 m) northwest of the original
alignment of the Project Area and between 400.0 and 800.0 feet (121.9 and 243.8 m) northwest
of the rerouted alignment of the Project Area (see Figure 4-1). As they will not be impacted by
the current undertaking, they were not reevaluated during the current investigations.

6.1

SITE 41MT78
General Description

Site 41MT78 coincides with Hughes’ Site 1 that he assessed in 1985 during a survey of
a then-proposed airport location for the City of Midland. In his letter report, Hughes describes
Site 1 as follows:
Site 1 is located on a gentle slope to the west and southwest of the very small
basin, in a cottonfield across a north-south road from the bottom of the
depression. It is evidenced by a light scattering of burned caliche pebbles over
an area some 50 meters in diameter. The field is in a large area of reddish
blowsand, well exposed by cultivation. The only other evidence observed was a
waste flake of Edwards chert. About all that can be inferred with regard to Site 1
is that it may represent a brief camp by a small group of prehistoric Indians
(Hughes 1985; see Figure 4-1).

Chapter 6.0: Results

Upon returning to the described location during the current survey efforts along the
rerouted alignment of the Project Area, the Horizon field crew also observed a sparse scattering
of burned caliche specimens within an active cotton field to the west of the small playa basin
noted by Hughes (1985; Figures 6-1 and 6-2). This scatter is located entirely to the west of an
existing north-south lease road and artificial berm, while the proposed reroute of the Project
Area is located entirely to the east of this existing lease road and artificial berm. As it is located
within an active cotton field, the vegetation across the site currently consists of short cotton
plants (Figures 6-3 and 6-4). The surface visibility across the site range from 75% to 100%.
Since the observed caliche scatter is located outside of the limits of the current Project
Area within an active cotton field, only surface inspection was conducted over the site.
However, a total of 7 shovel tests were excavated within the boundaries current Project Area,
just to the east of the site (see Figure 5-1). All of these produced negative results. Similarly,
surface inspection within the current Project Area also produced negative results, indicating that
the deposits of site 41MT78 do not extend in the current Project Area and will not be impacted
by the undertaking.
Observed Cultural Materials
Observed cultural materials on site 41MT78 consist of a sparse scatter of burned caliche
specimens within an active cotton field (Figure 6-5). Aside from burned caliche specimens, no
other cultural materials of any sort (e.g. lithic tools, ceramics, bone, charcoal, etc.) were
observed during the reevaluation of site 41MT78.
Observed Cultural Features
No evidence of any intact cultural features was observed on the modern, plowed ground
surface of the site or within any of the 7 shovel tests excavated to the east of site 41MT78.
However, the presence of scattered burned caliche at this location suggests that small hearths
or other cooking features may have once been utilized on this site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Hughes (1985) originally observed the scatter comprising his Site 1 over an area with a
diameter of 164.0 feet (50.0 m). Based on the distribution of observed cultural materials on the
modern, plowed ground surface, site 41MT78 measures approximately 246.1 feet (75.0 m)
north-south by 246.1 feet (75.0 m) east-west. This area is located just west and outside of the
rerouted alignment of the Project Area. No evidence of this site was noted within the limits of
the rerouted alignment.
When originally observed in 1985, Hughes only conducted a surface inspection over his
Site 1. Similarly, because the site’s deposits were observed just outside of the current Project
Area to the west, the Horizon field crew also only conducted surface inspections over the site.
As such, its exact vertical extent remains undetermined. However, as it is situated within an
upland desert setting lacking in alluvial sediments, it is assumed to have only surficial or nearsurface cultural deposits within heavily disturbed plowzone contexts. No subsurface cultural
materials were recovered from any of the 7 shovel tests excavated to the east of the site.

Site Summary
Site 41MT78 was originally documented by Hughes (1985) as Site 1 during a survey of a
then-proposed airport property. At that time, Hughes noted that the site was a light scatter of
burned caliche to the west and southwest of a small playa basin that may represent a brief
prehistoric encampment. As the site was sparse and heavily disturbed by routine agricultural
plowing, he indicated that it did not appear to merit further investigation or protective measures.
Horizon’s current investigations also found the site to consist of a sparse scatter of
burned caliche within a plowed agricultural field. While Hughes (1985) did note the presence of
1 chert flake on the site, the Horizon field crew observed no lithic debitage or any other type of
cultural material aside from the burned caliche specimens.
Site 41MT78 is located just outside of the limits of the current Project Area to the west
and will not be impacted by the current undertaking. Horizon only elected to formally document
it due to its relative proximity to the Project Area as well as the fact that it was never formally
documented when originally observed in 1985. As it is not located within the current Project
Area, its assessed significance has no relevance in regard to the current undertaking. However,
considering the lack of buried deposits, formal tools, temporally diagnostic material, and
preserved floral and faunal remains, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41MT78 would not qualify
for formal designation as a SAL if it ever needs to be considered in compliance with the ACT.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

During the months of July and August 2017, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of the portions of Enterprise’s proposed Loving to Midland pipeline ROW that
are located on public land in southwestern Martin County and north-central Midland County,
Texas. The development of the pipeline ROW will be privately funded and will not require any
federal permitting or coordination. However, portions of the proposed ROW cross land owned
by the City of Midland. Because this is public property, the portion of the proposed ROW on the
City of Midland property falls under the regulations of the ACT. At the request of Whitenton,
Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Enterprise in
compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological
sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the
potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as
SALs. The cultural resources investigations were conducted under TAC permit number 8095.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 106.0 miles (170.6 km) long by 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 1,284.8 acres. However, the Project Area
consists of only the segments of the proposed ROW on the property owned by the City of
Midland. The original route across the City of Midland property measured approximately 2.4
miles (3.7 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 29.1 acres. A
subsequent reroute of this alignment shifted the proposed ROW to the northwest and northeast,
resulting in a route across the City of Midland property that measured approximately 5.2 miles
(8.4 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a new total area of approximately 63.0 acres.
Horizon conducted the survey of the original alignment of the Project Area on 10 July
2017 and the survey of the rerouted alignment on 30 and 31 August 2017. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the Project Area. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the original
alignment of the Project Area totaled 2.4 miles (3.7 km) in length, a minimum of 37 shovel tests
were necessary in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 40 shovel tests along the original alignment of the Project Area. The
rerouted alignment of the Project Area totaled 5.2 miles (8.4 km) in length and required a

HJN 170063 AR

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

minimum of 84 shovel tests to meet the TSMASS. Horizon fell just short of the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 81 shovel tests along the rerouted alignment of the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the original alignment of the Project Area resulted in
entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the original
alignment of the Project Area or within any of the 40 excavated shovel tests.
The cultural resources investigations conducted along the rerouted alignment of the
Project Area resulted in the formal documentation of Hughes’ Site 1, which he noted in 1985
during an earlier assessment of the property containing the rerouted alignment of the Project
Area. This site, 41MT78, is technically located just outside of the limits of the current Project
Area and will not be impacted. However, Horizon elected to formally document it due to its
relative proximity to the Project Area. It consists of sparse and diffuse scatter of burned caliche
pebbles within a plowed agricultural field. No other cultural materials aside from burned caliche
were observed at this location. Considering the lack of buried deposits, formal tools, temporally
diagnostic material, and preserved floral and faunal remains, it is Horizon’s opinion that site
41MT78 would not qualify for formal designation as a SAL if it ever needs to be considered in
compliance with the ACT.
Based on his descriptions, the inferred locations of Hughes’ (1985) Site 2 and Site 3, as
well as the prairie dog town where he observed a fragment of fossilized bison vertebra, are all
located between 1300.0 and 1700.0 feet (396.2 and 518.2 m) northwest of the original
alignment of the Project Area and between 400.0 and 800.0 feet (121.9 and 243.8 m) northwest
of the rerouted alignment of the Project Area. As they will not be impacted by the current
undertaking, they were not reevaluated during the current investigations.

7.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results along the original and rerouted alignments of the
Project Area, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed Loving to Midland
pipeline ROW across property owned by the City of Midland will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Enterprise be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that
any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed pipeline ROW,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
