The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas

Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I want to thank Brett Cruse of the Texas Historical Commission. His support for
the project has been crucial in bringing it to completion, as is the financial support of the Texas Historical
Commission.
There are several institutions and people that I also must thank for their help and assistance in
completing this project. Foremost, the staff at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas at Austin (TARL) and the Mayborn Museum Complex at Baylor University opened
their collections for my examination, and I especially thank Marybeth Tomka and Lauren Bussiere of
TARL and Sabrina Thomas and Anita Benedict at the Mayborn Museum Complex.
Colleagues shared information and photo images, as well as pointed me towards sites with ceramics
that warranted consideration in this study. They include Thomas R. Hester, Harry J. Shafer, Edward B.
Jelks, Karl Kibler, Andy Malof, Carey Weber, Eric Schroeder, Richard Drass, Sarah Trabert, Charles
Hixson, and Dan Prikryl. Dan, in particular, was of great help in obtaining sherd collections on loan
from the Mayborn Museum Complex at Baylor University. Heath Bentley and Julian A. Sitters, both of
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc., located a report at TARL on a site in Mills County with ancestral Caddo
ceramics, and they were gracious enough to provide me with a PDF of the 1974 report. I also appreciate
the opportunity provided by Elton Prewitt to study the interesting ceramic vessel sherds from the Rowe
Valley site (41WM437), and to include their analysis in this study.
Several avocational archeologists also shared information on ceramic sherds of probable ancestral
Caddo origin they have found on Central Texas sites, and allowed me to document them and include the
findings in this study. They include Darrell Crain, Buddy Whitley, and Marcus Whittle.
I also thank Shirley Nedry for her permission to analyze the sherds in her collection from Bandera
County, Texas. I also appreciate the help of Stephen Bishop, Texas Historical Commission Archeology
Steward, for coordinating the study of the Nedry collection, providing notes and sherd photographs from
Texas Parks & Wildlife Department archaeologists on the sherds, and for mailing the sherds to me for
examination.
The figures and photographs in this report were prepared by a number of people, particularly by
Lance Trask. Others were provided by Lauren Bussiere, Sandy Hannum, Thomas R. Hester, Charles
Hixson, Harry J. Shafer, Darrell Crain, and Buddy Whitley. The formatting and printing of this report was
done by OneTouchPoint in Austin, Texas.

Introduction
The development and maintenance of long-distance trade networks for both economic, social, and
religious purposes was a notable feature of the ancestral Caddo tradition from its very beginnings, and
this includes the Caddo peoples that lived in East Texas. Bison hides, salt, raw materials such as copper,
galena, stone, and marine shell, and finished objects such as pottery vessels (and possibly their contents),
were part of the trading system.
Much of the archaeological evidence for the Caddo long-distance trade and exchange networks of
prestige goods occur in contexts dating from ca. A.D. 800 to 1400, with long-distance trade outside of
the East Texas communities seemingly declining after that time. Certainly, the best-known examples of
Caddo long-distance exchange are seen in the grave offerings from mound burials from the premier civicceremonial centers like Spiro, Crenshaw, Gahagan, Mounds Plantation, and Mineral Springs in eastern
Oklahoma, southwestern Arkansas, and northwestern Louisiana (see Girard et al. 2014), respectively,
and George C. Davis (41CE19) in East Texas. Exchanged goods in components dating from ca. A.D.
1000-1300âthe apex of the Caddoâs participation in long-distance trade network of prestige goodsâ
include a wide variety of prestige goods such as ceramic vessels, ceremonial tools, marine shell gorgets
and conchs, shell columella beads, stone pipes, copper masks and repoussÃ©, copper-covered ornaments,
and large chert bifaces. However, in the case of ancestral Caddo ceramic vessels, they were also traded
and exchanged by Caddo peoples throughout the length of their settlement in East Texas for other kinds
of goods as well as to help cement alliances, and this pattern of trade and exchange became especially
common after ca. A.D. 1400 between certain parts of East Texas (i.e., the Neches River basin) and
Central Texas aboriginal inhabitants, as Krieger (1946:Map 1) had indicated more than 70 years ago.
Evidence of this trade and exchange is clearly denoted by the wide distribution of Caddo ceramic
vessels from: Mississippian sites in Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Alabama; Plains Village sites
in the Central and Southern Plains (i.e., the Washita River, Great Bend of the Arkansas River, Great
Oasis, and Mill Creek cultures), and among hunting-gathering groups in the Texas Panhandle, Caprock
Canyonlands, the La Junta area at the confluence of the Rio Grande and Conchos river (see Kelley
1986:83), mission sites in South Texas and the central Texas Coast with Historic Caddo ceramics from
the Neches-Angelina river basins (cf. Lakeman 2001), and Central Texas (see Perttula 2002a). Ceramic
petrographic investigations also document the regular intra-regional exchange of ceramic vessels among
Caddo groups in East Texas. When the de Soto-Moscoso entrada encountered Caddo groups in East Texas
in 1542, and then in later 17th century Spanish entradas (Foster 2008:201-202), the chroniclers did note
the presence of cotton and turquoise that must have come from the Southwestern Pueblos (see Krieger
1946), indicating that long-distance Caddo interregional trade and exchange continued into the 16th and
late 17th centuries. Further evidence of the continued interregional trade after the late 17th century are
sherds from Patton Engraved vessels from La Junta (Kelley 1986).
In this monograph (see also Perttula 2017a, 2017c), I discuss the character of the ceramic vessel sherds
found on Central Texas sites, and one site in Dimmit County in southern Texas, that may have been made
by Caddo peoples living in East Texas (Figures 1 and 2). These sherds have been the subject primarily of
technological and stylistic analysis, but petrographic analysis and instrumental neutron activation analysis
has also been done by other researchers for some assemblages. The purpose of these analyses has been
to characterize these sherds with respect to their technological, stylistic, petrographic, and geochemical
diversity, and also to establish if these sherds are from vessels manufactured locally or extra-locally.
Specifically, the concern has been to establish through these various analyses if the sherds from certain
Central Texas sites are from aboriginal vessels made in the general vicinity of the site from local clays, were
made in other parts of Central Texas, or are sherds from vessels made in the Caddo area of East Texas.

2ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
At the present time, there are 34 counties in the overall region with sites that are likely to have Caddo
ceramic vessel sherds (Figure 1 and Table 1), based on published descriptions, macroscopic analyses,
and petrographic/chemical analyses. These counties are in the Blackland Prairie, Edwards Plateau, Llano
Uplift, the southern part of the Rolling Plains, and the South Texas Brush Country. Most of the known
sites and/or collections occur in the Blackland Prairie and Edwards Plateau in the Brazos River and Leon
River basins. Of the 163 known sites and/or collections identified to date (Table 1), 16.6 percent are
in McLennan County, another 14.7 percent are in Hill County, 13.5 percent are in Coryell County, 8.6
percent are in Williamson County, and 6.1 percent are in Bell County (Figure 2).

In the text that follows, I present data gathered on these likely Caddo ceramic sherds from sites and
collections in the aforementioned 34 Central Texas and South Texas counties. The presentation moves
from one county to another in alphabetical order. In some cases, the ceramic sherd data are summarized
from published CRM reports, or from the instrumental neutron activation analysis summarized in Creel et
al. (2013), but in other cases, the ceramic sherd data derives from detailed ceramic sherd analyses I have
completed on a number of Central Texas ceramic assemblages from (1) curated collections at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin, and (2) the Mayborn
Museum Complex at Baylor University, as well as the examination of ceramic sherds held by private
individuals.

10ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas

County by County Descriptions of Sites in Central Texas
with Ancestral Caddo Ceramics
In this section of the report I describe and/or analyze ceramic sherds or vessels by county from
aboriginal sites and collections in Central Texas and immediately surrounding counties that in all
likelihood are ancestral Caddo vessels and sherds made by Caddo potters in East Texas communities
between ca. A.D. 900 and the late 18th century. The level of detail varies considerably between sites and
collections, principally depending upon whether I had access to the site collections to conduct stylistic
and technological analyses, or had to rely on information presented in CRM reports on ceramic sherds, or
had to rely on photographs of sherds from collections in private hands.

Bandera County
Rainey (41BN33)
This multiple component prehistoric site is adjacent to a sinkhole on an upland ridge slope in the
Sabinal River basin in Bandera County. A single grog-tempered body sherd from an ancestral Caddo
vessel decorated with broad and parallel incised lines (Henderson 2001:265 and Figure 161f) was
recovered from Feature 16 outside the sinkhole. The ceramic type of the sherd is undetermined, but a
calibrated radiocarbon age range of A.D. 1484-1635 on charcoal from Feature 16 suggests the sherd is
likely from a Late Caddo period Maydelle Incised jar sherd (Henderson 2001:260 and Table 37).

Paul Olsen Collection, Unrecorded Site
The Paul Olsen collection from an unrecorded site in Bandera County (Thomas R. Hester, 2011
personal communication) has a single ancestral Caddo incised-punctated sherd, probably from a
Maydelle Incised jar. The rim sherd has vertical and curvilinear incised panels filled with rows of tool
punctations. On either side of these panels are sets of at least two vertical incised lines (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Maydelle Incised sherd from an unreported site
in Bandera County, Texas.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ11

Shirley Nedry Collection, Bandera County, Texas
Shirley Nedry has collected eight ceramic vessel sherds from the surface of an unrecorded prehistoric
site just south of the Albert and Bessie Kronkosky State Natural Area on Red Bluff Creek in the Medina
River drainage. With her permission, these sherds have been made available for detailed analysis.
The sherds include seven body sherds and one base sherd, likely from at least three different vessels
based on firing conditions and temper identified in each sherd core section (Table 2). Five of the sherds
have grog temper (i.e., crushed vessel sherds), two have grog and small pieces of burned bone, and one
sherd has grog and bone temper and a sandy paste; this sherd was made from a naturally sandy clay.

The sherds in the collection are from vessels fired in different ways. Two (from a jar and a bowl)
were fired and cooled in a low oxygen or reducing environment (B on Table 2), leaving the sherd core
and both surfaces a very dark grayish-brown color. Two sherds (a body sherd and base sherd from jars)
were incompletely oxidized during firing (E on Table 2). The remaining four sherds (three from jars and
one from a bowl) are from vessels fired in a reducing environment, but removed from the fire to cool
in the open air (G on Table 1). These sherds have a dark core and a thin oxidized zone at the exterior
surface. Ancestral Caddo vessels in East Texas are typically fired in this manner.
Six of the sherds are likely from thick-walled jars (with body and base thickness greater than 7.9 mm
(see Table 2). The other two sherds are from bowls with vessel wall thicknesses between 6.0-6.7 mm.
One of the sherds in the Shirley Nedry collection is from a decorated vessel (Sherd 1). This body
sherd has parallel brushing marks and overlapping opposed incised lines (Figure 4). The decoration
on this sherd compares favorably to Spradley Brushed-Incised, a utility ware found on Historic Caddo
Allen phase sites (dating from ca. A.D. 1680-1800) in the Neches-Angelina river basins in East Texas.
It consists of parallel brushing elements with overlapping straight incised lines that are opposed or
perpendicular to the brushing (Marceaux 2011:140 and Figure 5.2; Perttula and Selden 2014:Figure 42).

12ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas

Figure 4. Brushed-incised body sherd from the Shirley Nedry collection, Bandera County, Texas.
The tempers used in vessel manufacture of the sherds in the Nedry collection, as well as the firing
conditions, and the one decorated sherd likely from a Spradley Brushed-Incised vessel, indicate that these
sherds are from at least three different ancestral Caddo vessels made in East Texas sometime after A.D.
1680. It is most likely that they were made by Caddo potters belonging to a Historic Hasinai Caddo group
living in the Neches and Angelina River basins, and through exchange and social networks, the vessels
were moved to an aboriginal central Texas group that had settled in what is now Bandera County, Texas.

Bell County
Garth Site (41BL22)
Caddo ceramics from the Garth site, on the Leon River, include one grog-tempered sherd with a
red slip, a plain grog-tempered body sherd (Shafer et al. 1964), as well as bone-tempered sherds from
a jar with a tool punctated rim and a vertical brushed body (Figure 5) (Shafer 2012:Figure 11). Another
sherd, tempered with grog and bone, has opposed brushed-incised marks and lines (INAA, UT00384).
These sherds suggest use of the site after ca. A.D. 1200, when both red-slipped and brushed vessels were
commonly made by certain East Texas Caddo potters. Shafer (2012:48) has noted that âLate Prehistoric
sites along the eastern margins of the Leon River and its tributaries had an unusual quantity of ceramics,
both locally made and Caddo in origin.â

Penny Winkle (41BL23)
Shafer et al. (1964) recovered 13 sherds from at least four Caddo ceramic vessels at the Penny
Winkle site in the Leon River basin at Belton Reservoir. The site has both Austin and Toyah phase
diagnostics, but the ceramics appear to be part of the Toyah phase component.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ13

Figure 5. Reconstructed punctatedbrushed jar from the Garth site
(41BL22).
The recovered sherds include 10 plain sherds (most are grog-tempered, and are from one vessel) and
three grog-tempered sherds from decorated vessels. One carinated bowl sherd has an engraved-brushed
design (Shafer et al. 1964:Figure 15g), a jar sherd has brushing marks (Shafer et al. 1964:Figure 15h),
and another jar sherd is from a Maydelle Incised vessel with diagonal opposed incised lines (Figure 6);
samples of sherds from the Maydelle Incised jar and the parallel brushed body sherd were analyzed for
INAA and petrography (Perttula et al. 2003:11). These decorated sherds are consistent with a Late Caddo
period Frankston phase ceramic assemblage from the upper Neches River basin in East Texas.

Figure 6. Maydelle Incised jar sherd from
the Penny Winkle Site (41BL23).

14ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Simmons (41BL58)
The single ancestral Caddo ceramic sherd in the Simmons site assemblage at TARL is a plain grogtempered body sherd.

Domino (41BL65)
This site has a single grog-tempered rim sherd with horizontal incised lines (Shafer et al. 1964:65-68
and Figure 15j). This sherd is likely from a Davis Incised or Kiam Incised vessel (see Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plates 18 and 45), both types among the assemblage of Early Caddo ceramic wares from the Neches
River basin in East Texas, as well as other river basins in the region. The occupation of the site during the
Austin phase is consistent with this temporal attribution for the ceramic rim sherd.

Evoe Terrace (41BL104)
Sorrow et al. (1967:58-59) recovered 16 ceramic vessel sherds from three different parts of the
Evoe Terrace site; the site is on an alluvial terrace on the south side of the Lampasas River. Eight of the
sherds from Area A are from a single pinched jar, with no obvious temper. The eight sherds recovered
in Area B are from two different vessels, neither with any decoration; the temper on one of the vessels
was suggested to probably be bone, and the other vessel may not have had a temper, but only a sandy
paste (Sorrow et al. 1967:58). Two of the three body sherds in Area D are plain and apparently have
only a sandy paste or small particles of bone added as temper (Sorrow et al. 1967:59). The other sherd is
described as having a âsingle, straight, engraved lineâ¦or a scratched lineâ (Sorrow et al. 1967:58), and
bone temper.
The ancestral Caddo sherds at this site in the TARL collections include a grog-bone-tempered body
sherd with a single straight incised line (perhaps from a Maydelle Incised vessel, INAA UT00024)
from Area D, and a grog-tempered body sherd with a straight pinched ridge (INAA, UT00025), from
Area A. Both sherds are from Late Caddo period, Frankston phase vessels. Leon Plain sherds are also
in the ceramic assemblage, along with numerous Perdiz arrow points and Cliffton arrow point preforms
(Sorrow et al. 1967:59).

Bowmer Site (41BL116)
A total of 56 sherds and 25 sherdlets have been recovered from the Bowmer site during various
archaeological investigations (Table 3), beginning with Voltin (1996). All of the sherds from the
Bowmer site occur from the surface to a maximum of 99.60 m elevation, or from the surface to ca. 30
cm bs. There is a single uni-modal peak in sherd densities by the bottom depth of the levels that contain
sherdsâ99.75 m (ca. 15 cm bs) elevationâbut sherds from levels with bottom depths between 99.85 m
(ca. 5 cm bs) and 99.65 m (ca. 25 cm bs) are also relatively abundant.

The prehistoric occupation that left the aboriginal sherds was not substantial with respect to the
thickness of the archaeological deposits. Units with sherds from more than one 5 cm level (see Table
3) indicate that they come from mean depths of only 5.7-19 cm bs, suggesting the ceramic-bearing
prehistoric occupation was approximately 13 cm in thickness.
The aboriginal ceramic sherds from the Bowmer site were found in units covering an area of
approximately 33 m (north-south) x 29 m (east-west), or 957 m2. In the northwestern part of the
excavations, the sherd density is 1.0 sherd per m2. This compares to 2.5 sherds per m2 in the western
part of the excavations, and only 1.1 sherds per m2 in the main excavation block (Figure 7). Only one
sherd was recovered from excavations south of the N1000 grid line. The overall density across the site is
only 1.1 sherd per m2, suggesting that there are approximately 1050 sherds from at least an estimated 14
vessels (see below) distributed across this part of the Bowmer site.
The ceramic sherds from the Bowmer site consist exclusively of body sherds from thin-walled
vessels tempered, fired, burnished/smoothed, and decorated in several different ways. The detailed
analysis of each of the sherds from the Bowmer site is provided in Table 4.

20ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Approximately half of the sherds from the Bowmer site excavations are from a single vessel
(either a bowl or a carinated bowl) found in the main block (referred to hereafter as Vessel 1). This
vessel, represented by 29 body sherds, is bone and hematite-tempered, has a relatively simple engraved
decoration (see below), is well burnished on both interior and exterior vessel surfaces, and was fired and
cooled in a high oxygen environment (cf. Teltser 1993:Figure 2a). The other sherdsâbased on temper,
decoration, wall thickness, and firing conditionsâare from as many as 13 other vessels, either plain
(n=7) or decorated (n=6); none of these vessels are represented by more than six sherds, indicating a high
degree of fragmentation/breakage and vessel dispersion across the Bowmer site.
Based on the breakage patterns of the sherds, the pottery from the Bowmer site was made using clay
coils. Although there are no rim or base sherds in the sherd assemblage, it is likely that vessel construction
began with the base and then proceeded by stacking the coils one upon another, progressing up the vessel
body to the rim. These coils were welded together by âpressing each rope [or clay coil] down on the vesselâs
interior surface while pressing and pulling up on the potâs exteriorâ (Johnson 1994:205).
The prevalence of burned and crushed bone temper in the sherds from the Bowmer site (Table 5)
clearly demonstrates that these sherds are almost exclusively from bone-tempered wares, regardless
of the other aplastics that were documented in the sherd pastes. Similar bone-tempered ceramic
assemblages, some of which have sherds from engraved vessels, are documented over a large part of
Central and southern Texas in both prehistoric and early historic archaeological contexts, and the plain
wares are commonly referred to (although not necessarily with good reason) as Leon Plain when such
sherds are found in Late Prehistoric (post-ca. A.D. 1200) contexts and Goliad ware when found in early
to late historic 18th century mission contexts (Hester 1989; Ricklis 1995, 1999, 2000). In fact, âdespite
the difference in names, no clear-cut technological distinctions have been successfully recognized; hence
Leon Plain and Goliad ware probably represents a continuation of the same pottery traditionâ (Walter
2007:87). Approximately 96 percent of the sherds from the Bowmer site have bone temper (Table 5).

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ21
Tempers were added to the paste to hold the constituents of vessels together, but not limit the natural
plasticity of the clays chosen for vessel manufacture; too much temper added to the paste, and the clay
would be too limp to manipulate and shape, but too little temper, and a vessel would be likely to spall
and break when it was being fired. Although not quantified here, the amount of bone added to the paste
ranged from less than 5 percent to between 5-25 percent of the clay paste. Crushed and burned bone was
likely added to a vesselâs paste by these aboriginal potters because crushed and burned bone produces with
little effort angular particle shapes whose coarseness gave vessels tempered with it the ability to withstand
thermal shock. Johnson (1994:205) also has suggested that the addition of bone temperâas well as the
absolute amount of the distinctive temper added to the pasteâwas âto counteract the tackiness of the highly
plastic, fine-grained clay that they preferredâ¦if not enough bone is added to such clay, the greenware will
ruinously crack and spit.â That the bone temper in the Bowmer site ceramic sherds was fine to mediumtextured suggests that the clay used for vessel manufacture was not particularly fine-grained or highly
plastic as that documented by Johnson (1994) from various Toyah phase sites in Central Texas.
Hematite, which is a fairly common occurrence on the site (Andy Malof, April 2009 personal
communication) may have been added to the paste of certain vessels strictly as a matter of personal
choice by individual potters, but it may have served a useful purpose nonetheless. That is, the occurrence
of crushed grains of hematite in the paste would have enhanced a vesselâs ability to melt and fuse the
paste constituents during firing, thus resulting in a dense, hard body, and a reduced vessel porosity (Rice
1987:96). Similarly, the addition of a coarse temper like hematite pieces would have aided a vesselâs
ability to withstand thermal shock. Vessels with crushed pieces of hematite are particularly prevalent in
the engraved Vessel 1 (see Table 4).
One plain sherd has small pieces of fired clay or grog temper (see Table 5) along with fine or
moderate amounts of bone temper. Whether these pieces represent deliberately added crushed sherd
fragmentsâas is so commonly seen in East Texas Caddo ceramic waresâor incidental inclusions
incorporated in the clay paste during its preparation for vessel manufacture has not been determined.
Perhaps the potters of this bone-grog-tempered vessel recognized that the addition of grog or fired clay to
the vessel paste slowed the oxidation process during firing, creating darker-colored vessels in a reducing
firing environment (or lighter tan, orange, and brown colors in oxidizing environments), while allowing
them to be fired longer, and producing a harder ceramic vessel (Rice 1987:354; Teltser 1993:532, 540).
Since grog has expansion coefficients generally comparable to the coefficients of the clay paste most
commonly seen in aboriginal pottery vessels, this would have contributed further to the ability of fired
vessels to withstand heat-related stresses, as well as increasing their flexural strength (Rice 1987:362).
Only one (1.8 percent) of the Bowmer bone-tempered sherds has a sandy paste (see Table 5), and the
remainder have a silty to clayey paste. The occurrence of a single sandy paste vessel sherd suggests that
only rarely did the aboriginal potters there make use of a naturally sandy clay for vessel manufacture
(i.e., the clay contains some natural tempering particles in the form of sand).
Technological and petrographic studies of Late Prehistoric ceramics from Central and South Texas
sites indicate that bone-tempered sandy paste pottery is relatively common in 13th to 17th century sites.
Depending upon their location in these regions, if sandy paste bone-tempered pottery was manufactured,
it accounts for as little as 22-50 percent of the sherds or vessel groups (Hester and Parker 1970; Black
1986a, 1986b; Ricklis and Collins 1994; Quigg and Peck 1995; Perttula 2009) to as much as 70-100
percent (Black 1986b; Rogers and Perttula 2005). The most reasonable explanation for the technological
diversity documented in Central and South Texas bone-tempered pottery is that it is both (1) a reflection
of situational (physical and geological) variations in the character of the clay sources that were available
for vessel manufacture, and (2) the knowledge that aboriginal potters had about clay as well as ceramic

22ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
pastes and fabrics (the quantity and proportion of aplastics and other inclusions, both natural and
additive) that could be brought to bear to insure the successful manufacture of plain bone-tempered
pottery vessels that had different intended functions. It is important to document both the natural
variation that must exist in the clay sources in the region (e.g., Neff and Glascock 2005:C-12 to C-13)
that would have been suitable for ceramic manufacture, as well as the intra-regional variation in pottery
fabrics (i.e., the mixture of clay and temper to make pottery) that is suspected to have characterized
the ceramic assemblages produced by a diverse number of aboriginal groups at different times and in
different places across this large region.
The 18 decorated sherds in the Bowmer site sherd assemblage are equally divided between fine wares
(n=9) and utility wares (n=9). The fine wares include the engraved vessel sherds from bowls and/or
carinated bowls, while the utility wares are the coarse paste decorated vessels, usually cooking or storage
jars and simple bowls. These wares, when found on Caddo sites in East Texas, are known to have been
made and used differently, based on functional, technological, and stylistic analyses on numerous Caddo
sherd assemblages in the broader East Texas region, with uses ranging from food service, cooking of food
stuffs, as containers for liquids, and for plant food/seed crop storage. How do the decorated sherds from
the Bowmer site compare to Caddo decorated vessel sherds?
The Vessel 1 decorated sherds (n=7) include several different finely engraved elements (Figure 8ad) that are found on the rim and /or upper body of a bowl or carinated bowl; there are no rim sherds or
sherds broken at the carination to definitively establish its form. Based on the combination of engraved
elements, the engraved motif consists of a single horizontal engraved line at the base of an engraved
panel on the rim and upper body, and the panel is composed of a series of at least four diagonal opposed
engraved lines (Figure 8a-b). Comparable decorative elements and motifs are found in Caddo fine wares
from Early Caddo (ca. A.D. 900-1200) and Middle Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1200-1400) contexts in East
Texas, although because of the generalized motif, the specific defined ceramic type is not known. The
Vessel 1 engraved sherds are confined to the main block excavation at the Bowmer site (Figure 9).

The two other engraved sherds are from two different vessels. One of the sherds has a set of parallel
engraved lines, while the other has both parallel engraved lines and broadly-spaced cross-hatched lines
(see Figure 8e). If it were not for differences in temper, firing conditions, or body wall thickness, the
design and execution of the finely engraved sherds could comfortably also be attributed to Vessel 1. It
seems likely that the Vessel 1 and other engraved sherds are part of a ceramic assemblage left during a
single occupational episode dating before ca. A.D. 1400.
The utility wares include body sherds from an estimated four (or possibly five) bone-tempered
vessels with punctated (n=1), incised (n=2), brushed (n=2), and brushed-incised (n=4) decorative
elements. The one punctated sherd has a single row of tool punctates. The incised body sherds include
one with a single straight incised line and another with widely-spaced sets of parallel lines. The temporal
or typological affiliation of these sherds is not known.
The brushed and brushed-incised sherds have a northern and western distribution in the Bowmer
site excavations (Figure 10), different from that documented for the fine wares. Two of the sherds have
parallel (probably oriented vertically on the vessel body) brushing marks, while three of the brushedincised sherds have sets of parallel and closely-spaced brushed and incised lines, likely also oriented
vertically on the body of utility ware jars. The last brushed-incised sherd has parallel brushing marks on
the exterior vessel surface and a single straight incised line on the vessel interior surface.
Sherds from brushed, brushed-incised, and brushed-punctated vessels have been found in prehistoric
and early historic aboriginal sites in both Central Texas and East Texas Caddo sites (Suhm 1955; Ricklis
and Collins 1994:Table 47; Perttula et al. 2003; Shafer 2006). In both regions, brushed pottery appears to
be present only in post-A.D. 1200/1300 sites, although it is not usually particularly abundant in Central
Texas sites, since ceramic vessel sherds of any kind are generally sparse in this region. Brushed pottery
in the Big Cypress, middle Sabine, and Neches-Angelina river basins in East Texas comprises at least
40-60 percent of all the decorated sherds in many large ceramic assemblages; brushed pottery becomes
especially common after the 15th century A.D. in this part of the Caddo area, reaching proportions of
more than 80 percent in some early historic Caddo sites (Perttula 2013; Perttula et al. 2003:11). Much of
the brushed pottery in East Texas Caddo sites is bone-tempered, as is the case with brushed Central Texas
pottery.
Many of the pottery sherds from the three Bowmer site have been either smoothed or burnished on
one or both vessel surfaces: burnishing of interior and exterior sherd surfaces is particularly common in
the assemblage, more so on the Vessel 1 and plain sherds (Table 6). Sherds with burnished and/or floated
(i.e., a rubbing of the vessel surface that âbrings to the surface many fine-grained particles,â Johnson
1994:193) exterior surfaces comprise between 50-79.3 percent of the sherds; 33-50 percent of the sherds
also have burnishing on interior vessel surfaces. Smoothed vessel surfaces are not common among any of
the wares.

When done, the burnishing or smoothing of the pottery from the Bowmer site was likely completed
primarily to lower the permeability of particular vessels (cf. Rice 1996:148), to better hold liquids or
food stuffs (cf. Johnson 1994:193) in plain or engraved bowls or carinated bowls, or to increase their
heating effectiveness (in the case of utility ware cooking jars) Smoothing also served to better weld the
vessel coils together before firing.
Given that burnishing is more prevalent on sherd exterior surfaces in the sherd assemblage from the
site (see Table 6)âbut is still commonly seen on interior vessel surfacesâsuggests that many of the
sherds are from vessels that were not used for cooking per se, but probably instead to serve and hold
foods and liquids. The practice of smoothing or burnishing interior surfaces of such vessels would have
been advantageous in the repeated use of such serving vessels. Additionally, the exterior smoothing and
burnishing was probably also designed for stylistic and display purposes, creating a flat and lustrous
surface (cf. Johnson 1994:193), even if that surface was not decorated.
The pottery from the Bowmer site was fired in a variety of ways. The engraved Vessel 1 sherds were
fired and cooled in a high oxygen environment (Table 7). The potters that made this engraved vessel
were successful in firing it at a sufficiently high temperature and duration that the paste was completely
oxidized, producing a durable vessel that was not subject to diminished strength from cumulative thermal
fatigue, cracks, or fractures.

The other engraved sherds were from vessels either incompletely oxidized during firing, or fired in a
low oxygen or reducing environment (probably smothered in a bed of coals from a wood fire). Between
68.8-88.9 percent of the utility ware and plain ware sherds were also fired in a reducing environment
(see Table 7). Many of these sherds were from vessels that were subsequently cooled in a high oxygen

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ27
environment (i.e., fire-hardened vessels were removed from the fire to cool), where either one or both
vessel surfaces had thin oxidized or light-colored (reddish-brown to yellowish-brown) surface colors.
The more heterogeneous firing conditions in the remainder of the vessel sherd assemblage suggests that
as long as the porosity of the vessels being used at the Bowmer site was not excessive, and there was a
good balance between clay plasticity and temper constituents, they were not fired for as long a time as the
harder engraved wares, but they were still quite serviceable vessels.
Two plain sherds from the Bowmer site have a distinctive core, much of the core having a light
oxidized exterior and a thin dark interior cross-section (see Table 7), suggesting they are from vessels
that have been smothered, sooted, or smudged during firing. Aten and Bollich (2002:54-55) note that this
manner of vessel firing is characteristic of a sandy paste pottery ware such as Goose Creek Plain, var.
unspecified. They also suggest that vessels with this kind of firing may have been placed in a fire with the
âorifice [of the vessel] facing into the fire.â Furthermore, the sherds with cores lighter than the surfaces
may have come from vessels where âafter extended firing that burned off all organics, the fire may have
been smothered to cause reduction and darkening of the exterior surface.â
Regardless of the ware, the vessel sherds from the Bowmer site have thin body walls (Table 8). Mean
body wall thickness ranges only from 4.95-5.76 mm.

The quite uniform thickness of vessel body sherds between the different wares at the Bowmer
siteâespecially the engraved and utility wares with CV values ranging only from 5.1-8.2 (see Table
8)âsuggest that the aboriginal potters were adept at the manufacture and finishing of vessels with a
narrowly defined idea regarding the acceptable thickness of usable vessels. The plain sherds are much
more variable in thickness, likely because there are several different vessels represented (estimated seven
vessels) in the plain sherds, and some of these may have been of different sizes, or are from functionallyspecific classes of pottery that have thicker walls than other kinds of vessels in use (cf. Ulrich 2006:125).
In summary, the ceramic vessel sherds from the Bowmer site include 29 from Vessel 1, an engraved
bone-tempered bowl or carinated bowl, two other engraved sherds from separate vessels, nine utility
ware brushed, brushed-incised, incised, and punctated sherds from an estimated four vessels, most likely
jars, and 16 plain sherds from an estimated seven vessels. These sherds are from uniformly thin-walled
(4.9-5.76 mm), smoothed to burnished, and bone- or bone-hematite-tempered vessels made from a silty
or clayey paste that were either fired in a high oxygen or oxidizing environment (Vessel 1) or in a low
oxygen or reducing environment (utility wares and plain sherds), then left to cool in the open air. In these
technological characteristics, the bone- and bone-hematite-tempered vessel sherds from the Bowmer site
are very similar to 13th to 17th century A.D. aboriginal sherd assemblages from a number of Central and
South Texas Toyah phase sites (see Perttula 2009:Table 11), and would suggest that these sherds are from
vessels made by groups that ranged across both regions. However, the diversity of decorated sherds from
the Bowmer site, particularly the engraved sherds from a minimum of three vessels, may tell a different
story with respect to the origins and cultural affiliation of these vessel sherds.

28ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
While not found in great numbers, engraved sherds from vessels of apparent Caddo origin have been
found at a number of sites in Central Texas (see Watt 1953; Jelks 1962; Sorrow et al. 1967; Stephenson
1970; Ricklis and Collins 1994; Turner 1997; Perttula et al. 2003; Shafer 2006), particularly sites
ârestricted to the eastern margin of the Edwards Plateau and the prairie environment immediately to the
east and northeast of the plateauâ (Ricklis and Collins 1994:305 and Figure 155). These engraved wares
are from contexts that in East Texas Caddo sites would date from Early Caddo (ca. A.D. 900-1200) to
Historic Caddo (ca. A.D. 1680-1800) times, but with an apparent peak in Caddo style engraved pottery
in Central Texas prairie sites dating before ca. A.D. 1300 (cf. Shafer 2006). The Bowmer site engraved
wares, although from an undated context, may also be from an occupation that falls in this early period.
However, the recovery of brushed pottery from Bowmerâif this pottery is associated with the engraved
wares, which seems likely given its depth in the archaeological deposits and the small occupation area
with ceramic sherdsâsuggests (if temporal comparisons with the East Texas Caddo area are appropriate
with respect to brushed utility wares, since some brushed pottery may have been made in Central Texas
and were not Caddo trade wares, see Suhm 1955:19) that the occupation would have been after ca. A.D.
1200/1250, and perhaps even after ca. A.D. 1300.
Shafer (2006:5) has strongly suggested that â[a]rguable prehistoric Caddoan [sic] groups occupied
the central Brazos valley and its tributaries by A.D. 1100 if not earlier, based on cross-dating artifact
styles from the George C. Davis siteâ¦Terminal dates are ca. A.D. 1250-1300, based on cross-dating and
extant datesâ from prehistoric sites in Central Texas. Shafer considers these groups the Prairie Caddo.
He goes on to hypothesize that the southern Prairie Caddo (i.e., the central Brazos and its tributaries)
permanently occupied âportions of the central Brazos valley with intermittent and interdigitated Caddo
presence in the peripheries to the west and southâ (Shafer 2006:7). The Bowmer site is located in one of
these proposed peripheral areas to the west of the Brazos River.
It has been further suggested by Shafer (2006:10) that Caddo ceramics made at the George C. Davis
site in the middle Neches River valley were moving or being exported to outlying settlements in the
southern Prairie Caddo area. This pottery was thought to have been obtained during feasting activities
at the George C. Davis site, and then apparently carried back to Central Texas and used âessentially for
domestic rolesâ (Shafer 2006:26). He also suggests that âthe absence of fine engraved pottery would be
expected in small hunting camps,â while larger villages on the Brazos and various tributaries would have
a âvariety of vessels in both form and decorationâ (Shafer 2006:10). It is not known if the Bowmer site
is considered a hunting camp, but Malof (2009 personal communication) suggests it is a base camp used
seasonally, probably during the late summer/early fall; the occupational area is small. Nevertheless, this
site, located in a peripheral part of the central Brazos river basin, contains an impressive diversity among
its small sample of sherds of engraved wares (none specifically identified as coming from Early Caddo
types), decorated utility wares, and sherds from plain vessels. All of it is bone-tempered, which is prima
facie evidence that these sherds did not come from the George C. Davis site, as almost all the pottery
from this site is grog-tempered (Shafer 2006:25).
Another possibility, one I favor, is that Caddo vessels manufactured in a number of different regions
in East Texas (see Perttula et al. 2003:Figure 16) were only very occasionally traded or exchanged for
various reasons (not just feasting) with aboriginal hunter-gatherer groups whose territorial range included
the Central Brazos river basin. These same hunter-gatherer groups did make their own pottery, primarily
a plain bone-tempered ware as well as probably a brushed-punctated utility ware (Boothe Brushed) that
closely resembles Bullard Brushed in character. On the basis of a stylistic, petrographic, and chemical
analysis of sherds from 11 Central Texas sites (Perttula et al. 2003:Figure 1), Perttula et al. (2003:63)
concluded that:

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ29
The generally low number of Caddoan [sic] pottery sherds found on many central Texas
sites, and the fact that the pottery was not made from central Texas clays, indicates that the
sherds are from vessels traded to local central Texas hunter-gatherers, not vessels produced by
Caddoan [sic] peoples who had settled in or were periodically using the central Texas region.
From these findings, the majority of the vessel sherds from the Bowmer siteâalmost certainly the
engraved vessel sherdsâare likely to be from vessels made by Caddo potters living in East Texas. Where
within this Caddo region is not known presently because the stylistic character of the engraved sherds is
not regionally distinctive. The fact that the engraved sherds are from bone-tempered vessels does not help
narrow down the region of vessel production because bone-tempered Caddo potteryâwhether from plain
or decorated vesselsâis present in a number of different areas across East Texas (Figure 11). Probably
the best known area of bone-tempered Caddo pottery in East Texas, also associated with the manufacture
of brushed pottery and distinctive hatched and curvilinear zoned engraved wares, is in the Angelina-lower
Sabine river basins, especially after ca. A.D. 1250 (Perttula 2008:Figure 12-3, 2015a:Figure 11). Perhaps
some of the Bowmer vessels originated in this part of Hasinai Caddo territory?

30ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
41BL117
There are both Toyah phase Leon Plain ceramic sherds and ancestral Caddo ceramic sherds in the
TARL collections from 41BL117. The latter include three plain grog-tempered body sherds, a grog-bonetempered body sherd with a row of fingernail punctations, and a grog-bone-tempered body sherd with
closely-spaced parallel incised lines.

41BL125
This aboriginal site is on Pepper Creek near its confluence with the Leon River (Kehl 1987, 1990).
A surface collection obtained in the mid-1960s had 25 ceramic sherds from ancestral Caddo vessels,
including a jar and a carinated bowl. These sherds were decorated with brushed, engraved, incised, and
punctated decorative elements (Kehl 1990:8), and five of the engraved sherds had a red clay pigment
rubbed in the engraved lines. According to Kehl (1990:8), âabout half of the sherds contain grog particles
as part of the clay paste.â The brushed sherds found at 41BL125 are indicative of use by an aboriginal
community after ca. A.D. 1200-1250.

41BL323
There is a single ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherd at 41BL323 in the TARL collections. It is a
plain grog-tempered body sherd that can only be roughly dated to only post-ca. A.D. 800 or thereabouts.

5th Street Road
There is a grog-bone-tempered Bullard Brushed body sherd (INAA, UT00382) from this site in the
TARL collections. The sherd has both parallel and overlapping brushing marks, and is likely from a
Bullard Brushed vessel.

Bexar County
Granburg Site (41BX17)
Schuetz (1966:56 and Plate 3g) reports that an incised Caddo sherd was recovered in the
archaeological investigations at the Granburg site on Salado Creek in the Blackland Prairie in Bexar
County. The sherd is from a Maydelle Incised jar with diagonal opposed incised triangle elements (cf.
Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 52b).

Stealth Cave (41BX1253)
A cave in a low bluff along Salado Creek at Fort Bullis contains archaeological deposits, including a
Maydelle Incised rim sherd (Veni et al. 1998:70-71 and Figure 10; Kibler 2002) with diagonal opposed
incised lines (Figure 12). This indicates some use of the cave after ca. A.D. 1400, as Maydelle Incised is
a common utility ware in Late Caddo period communities in both Frankston and Titus phase sites in East
Texas.

deposits (Figure 13). The rim has incised triangle elements filled either with rows of tool punctations or
diagonal incised lines pitched in alternating directions around the rim.

32ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Wheatley (41BC114)
A single ancestral Caddo sherd was found at the Wheatley site (41BC114) in Pedernales Falls State
Park, on an alluvial terrace of the Pedernales River, during 2001 investigations by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department. The sherd, in the TARL collections, is from a grog-tempered and sandy paste vessel
with parallel brushing marks, likely a Bullard Brushed jar sherd.
Earlier, Greer (1976:106 and Table 2) noted that 15 sherds of brushed ceramic sherds, possibly
tempered with grog, were recovered at the Wheatley site from two different activity areas (G and H).
Additionally, more than 1200 other sherds from several plain ware vessels were found at the Wheatley
site, and these were either bone- or possibly shell-tempered. Greer (1976:140) suggests the site was
occupied between ca. A.D. 1150-1300. Because the occurrence of brushed pottery in ancestral Caddo
sites in East Texas generally dates after ca. A.D. 1200/1250, and the brushed pottery at the Wheatley
site likely originated in the Neches River basin among Middle Caddo (ca. A.D. 1200-1400) and later
Frankston phase Caddo peoples of the Late Caddo period, the estimated age of the occupation may be
later than Greer (1976) posited.

Bosque County
Brawleyâs Cave (41BQ20)
At least one brushed bone-tempered Caddo ceramic jar sherd has been found in this rock shelter west
of the Bosque River. According to Olds (1965:141), the sherd has bone temper, and âa little sand mixed
in the paste.â This body sherd has parallel brushing marks (Olds 1965:Figure 10i).

Horn Shelter #2 (41BQ46)
A small number of ceramic sherds were found in the north end excavations at Horn Shelter #2; they
are in the Mayborn Museum Complex at Baylor University. This includes one bone-tempered Doss
Redware body sherd, three plain grog-tempered body and base sherds from a Caddo vessel, and groups
of two cross-hatched incised vessels: Vessel 1 (n=1 body sherd) and Vessel 2 (n=8 body sherds) (Figure
14). Both of these vessel sections are from Maydelle Incised jars, suggesting they originated in either the
Neches, Sabine, or Big Cypress stream basins in East Texas after ca. A.D. 1300-1400. The one available
uncorrected radiocarbon date from the ceramic-bearing deposits in the shelter is A.D. 1340 + 135 (Tx1723) (Watt 1978:119; Forrester 1985:27; Young 1988:Table 1).

41BQ285
Site 41BQ285 is located on an alluvial terrace of the North Bosque River on the Grand Prairie. Test
excavations were done there in 2006 (Griffith et al. 2010). The five sherds from 41BQ285 that have
been studied are from Unit 5, a unit that had an area of burned rock and mussel shell. One sherd (#51) is
from 30-40 cm bs, a second sherd (#52) is from 40-50 cm bs, and the other three sherds (#53-1, #53-2,
and #53-3) are from 50-60 cm bs. Presumably these sherds are from a single prehistoric archaeological
component, one apparently associated with the Late Prehistoric Toyah phase (ca. A.D. 1200-1700)
(Douglas Boyd, May 2009 personal communication). Based on differences in temper or apparent temper,
firing, and decoration (Table 9), the five sherds are apparently from four different vessels; sherds #53-1
and #53-3 may be from the same vessel.

34ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Sherd #51 is from an engraved carinated bowl (see Table 9), a vessel form associated with the
manufacture of prehistoric and early historic Caddo ceramics throughout all of East Texas (see Suhm and
Jelks 1962). The form of the vessels from which the other four sherds derive is not knownâprimarily
because of the small size of the sherdsâbut the sherd thickness (7.4-8.2 mm) and the decoration
(fingernail punctated) suggest that they are from utility ware vessels, probably cooking jars; the two
exterior burnished sherds #52 and #53-1 may be from simple bowls.
Technological, stylistic, petrographic, and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) have
all been employed to characterize the nature of the prehistoric ceramic sherds from 41BQ285, but also
to ascertain (within reasonable limits) the source and production locales of the five sherds from the
Toyah phase occupation at the site (see Perttula et al. 2010). The findings of these various approaches
are not completely consistent with each other, and this synthesis of the findings reviews the interpretive
possibilities arising from the detailed analysis of the 41BQ285 sherds.
The findings of the petrographic analysis and the INAA of four of the sherds (sherds #52, #53-1, #53-2,
and #53-3) from 41BQ285 are in agreement that they are from sherds manufactured from Central Texas
clays (Paste Group 2 and CT 2 chemical group), perhaps alluvial clays available in the immediate vicinity
of the site. The stylistic and technological analyses of these four sherds are more ambiguous, primarily
because of the fact that two of the sherds are undecorated, and two have simple fingernail punctated
designs; there may be incidental fired clay pieces in the pastes (see Table 9). These sherds appear to be from
cooking jars, a common vessel form among most prehistoric ceramic traditions in Texas, and otherwise
they possess no particular technological or stylistic characteristics that would suggest an East Texas Caddo
origin. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude on the basis of all the analyses that four of the sherds from
41BQ285 represent sherds from a local prehistoric Central Texas ceramic tradition.
Sherd #51 from 41BQ285 is from a grog-tempered carinated bowl decorated with diagonal engraved
lines. On stylistic and technological grounds, as well as based on the vessel form, a form apparently
specific to Caddo ceramic traditions in Texas, this particular sherd may reasonably be concluded to be
from a Caddo vessel made in East Texas. The petrographic analysis also concludes that this sherd, of
Paste Group 1, is from a Caddo vessel made in East Texas. The evidence to support this petrographic
analysis conclusion is the use of grog temper added to the paste, the amount of hematite in the paste,
as well as the density (pore space) of the paste in comparison to the Paste Group 2 sherds. The INAA,
however, of sherd #51, makes the alternative case that this sherd belongs to the CT 2 chemical group
(in fact, the probability of membership of sherd #51 in the CT 2 chemical group is higher than the other
four sherds from 41BQ285, see Perttula et al. 2010:Table 4). Furthermore, no conclusive linkages could
be made from the INAA results of sherd #51 with existing East Texas Caddo chemical groups. What is
the most reasonable conclusion, then, concerning the cultural affiliation and production locale of the one
engraved and grog-tempered sherd from 41BQ285? The engraved sherd from 41BQ285 appears to be
associated with an occupation that would date no earlier than the late 13th century A.D., and might well
date after the 15th century A.D.
While Caddo vessels manufactured in a number of different regions in East Texas (see Perttula
et al. 2003:Figure 16) may have only been occasionally traded or exchanged for various reasons with
aboriginal hunter-gatherer groups whose territorial range included the Central Brazos river basin, these
same hunter-gatherer groups did make their own pottery, albeit in low amounts, as indicated by the
recovery of locally produced plain and fingernail punctated sherds at 41BQ285 from Paste Group 2, as
well as bone-tempered plain and bone-tempered brushed-punctated utility wares (Boothe Brushed) from
a number of sites across the region.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ35
Engraved vessel sherds from Central Texas aboriginal sites, including the one sherd from 41BQ285,
are likely to be from vessels made by Caddo potters living in East Texas. Where within this Caddo
region the vessel represented by the one engraved sherd at 41BQ285 was made is not known because the
stylistic character of the engraved sherd is not regionally distinctive. The fact that the engraved sherd is
from a grog-tempered vessel also does not help narrow down the region of vessel production because
such Caddo potteryâwhether from plain or decorated vesselsâis present throughout East Texas in
Caddo times.
41BQ285 is located in one of the proposed peripheral areas identified by Shafer (2006) to the west
of the Brazos River, and may be considered by some to be a southern Prairie Caddo site. It is not known
if 41BQ285 is considered a hunting camp, but Griffith et al. (2010) suggests the site was used for only a
limited number of activities and that a wide range of local faunas were exploited by its occupants. These
occupants used, broke, and discarded at least one engraved vessel at the site, but during a time period
after the George C. Davis site was abandoned (ca. early A.D. 1300s), in the 13th through 16th centuries
A.D. (Griffith et al. 2010:Table 3.3). Neither the petrographic analysis or the INAA results suggest,
however, that the 41BQ285 vessel was made in the middle Neches River valley, leaving little possibility
that its production locale was the George C. Davis Caddo community. This does not mean, however, that
a southern Prairie Caddo potter living in the central Brazos River basin did not make the engraved vessel
that was subsequently discarded at 41BQ285.

36ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
the petrographic findings. In particular, while grog tempering and hematite are present in the paste of
sherd #51 (and hematite is also present in sherds #52, #53-2, and #53-3, see Perttula et al. 2010:Table
2) at 41BQ285âand are common constituents in East Texas Caddo pottery (Perttula 1999 (ed.):Table
9-14), particularly grog temper, but less so hematite inclusionsâthere are a number of examples in other
Central Texas ceramic assemblages of demonstrably locally produced ceramic wares (i.e., Toyah phase
wares, in the main) also containing both inclusions (see Black 1986; Green and Hester 1973; Highley
1986; Perttula 2009a, 2009b; Quigg and Peck 1995; Reese-Taylor 1995; Skelton 1977; Treece et al. 1993;
Trierweiler 1996). The âgrogâ is typically described as fired clay lumps.
In the specific case of hematite, the occurrence of hematite in the paste of Caddo sherds, as detected
in a number of petrographic analyses from East Texas Caddo sites in the Sabine, Sulphur, and Big Cypress
stream basins, ranges from only 0.6-7.7 percent of the point counts, with a mean percentage of only 3.3
percent (Perttula 1999 (ed.):Table 9-14). Three of the four sherds from 41BQ285, including the engraved
sherd (#51) and two (#53-2 and #53-3) of the four other sherds rather convincingly shown by petrographic
analysis and INAA to be considered to have come from Central Texas manufactured vessels, have higher
hematite point count percentages (see Perttula et al. 2010:Table 2). The presence and proportion of hematite
may not be a particularly robust measure of ceramic provenance or production locales.
What is intriguing about the engraved sherd from 41BQ285 is that it contains rock particles of
igneous origin (Rock A in Perttula et al. 2010:Table 2). Three of the sherds in Paste Group 2âconsidered
to represent sherds from vessels made with Central Texas claysâalso have the same igneous rock
particles in their paste. It is not to be expected that East Texas clays would contain igneous particles, as
the geological formations in the region are the product of deposition of coastal parent materials, while
parent materials in various parts of Central Texas are derived from igneous formations.
All things being equal, it is a curious finding that igneous rock particles are an inclusion in the
engraved sherd (#51) from 41BQ285. That finding, along with the fact that the same igneous rocks are
found in most of the other sherds from the site that are considered to be from vessels made from Central
Texas clays (Paste Group 2), when coupled with the INAA findings of a high probability of membership
in the CT 2 chemical group, lends weight ultimately to the conclusion that this engraved sherd was from
a vessel made from a Central Texas clay source. What prehistoric aboriginal group made this sherd
remains to be determined.
The engraved sherd has a panel of diagonal engraved lines on the rim of the carinated bowl. This
relatively simple geometric design is present on several defined Caddo pottery types, including Holly
Fine Engraved, Sanders Engraved, and Spiro Engraved (see Suhm and Jelks 1962), although the
engraved lines on Holly Fine Engraved and Spiro Engraved are typically finely executed, while the
engraved lines on sherd #51 are assuredly not finely executed. Such a geometric design on a carinated
bowl form is probably also part of the decorative motifs on a number of typologically undefined Early
and Middle Caddo pottery vessels and sherds in East Texas. No typological identification is attempted of
the 41BQ285 sherds. The Early and Middle Caddo periods in East Texas range from ca. A.D. 1000-1400
in age (Story 1990a), and a Middle Caddo affiliation for the engraved sherd from 41BQ285, would be
consistent with the recovery of both Perdiz points and several of the calibrated radiocarbon dates from
the site.
Two body sherds (#53-2 and #53-3) have single fingernail punctations (see Table 8). Given the size
of the sherds, the occurrence of only single fingernail punctates suggests that these two vessels must have
had widely-spaced and/or freely-spaced fingernail punctations on the vessel body.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ37
Four of the five sherds from 41BQ285 are apparently tempered with grog or small amounts of
crushed pieces of fired clay (see Table 9). Whether these pieces represent deliberately added crushed
sherd fragmentsâas is so commonly seen in East Texas Caddo ceramic waresâor incidental inclusions
incorporated in the clay paste during its preparation for vessel manufacture has not been determined.
The absence of identified grog aplastics in the petrographic analysis of three of these four sherds suggest
they the small pieces of apparent fired clay are probably incidental inclusions, and not deliberately
added pieces of temper, except in the case of the grog-tempered engraved sherd (see Table 8). One of
the fingernail punctated sherds has a sparse amount of burned bone temper. Grog is the preferred temper
of choice for Caddo pottery throughout much of East Texas and for all temporal periods, particularly in
the upper Neches, Sabine, Big Cypress, and Sulphur River basins. Shell-tempered pottery began to be
manufactured by Caddo potters after ca. A.D. 1300 in much of the Red River basin in East Texas, while
the use of bone as a temper was common around the same time in parts of the Neches and Angelina River
basins (see Perttula 2011:Figure 6-70).
Three of the sherds have been burnished on one or both vessel surfaces, and the other two have
smoothed vessel surfaces (see Table 9). The one carinated bowl sherd has been burnished on both vessel
surfaces, and one fingernail punctated sherd has been smoothed on both vessel surfaces.
Three of the five sherds are from vessels fired in a reducing or low oxygen environment (probably
smothered in a bed of coals from a wood fire). These vessels were subsequently exposed to air and/or
cooled in a high oxygen environment (i.e., fire-hardened vessels were removed from the fire to cool),
where either one or both vessel surfaces had thin oxidized or light-colored (red to reddish-brown) surface
colors. Two sherds have a distinctive core, with a light exterior and core, except for a thin dark band
along the interior surface (firing condition K on Table 9). These vessels with this kind of firing may have
been placed in a fire with the âorifice [of the vessel] facing into the fireâ (Aten and Bollich 2002:54-55).
Furthermore, the sherds with cores lighter than one or both surfaces may have come from vessels where
âafter extended firing that burned off all organics, the fire may have been smothered to cause reduction
and darkening of the exterior surface.â

41BQ293
Two plain grit-tempered sherds from the same vessel (fired and cooled in a reducing environment and
smoothed on the exterior), and found on the surface, were recovered in investigations of a Toyah phase
component at 41BQ293 (Jones 2009:56-57 and Figure 8.7). The âgritâ in the paste may be sand particles,
or crushed rocks, but this is not mentioned in Jones (2009). INAA results suggest this vessel may have
originated in East Texas, but this could not be determined with confidence.

41BQ295
The two plain grit-tempered sherds from 41BQ295 were analyzed by INAA, and the results suggest
that the sherds are from vessels that may have also originated in East Texas (Jones 2009:92-93). One
sherd was found on the surface and the other from 50-60 cm bs. Ferguson and Glascock (2009:273283) state that because of regional clay similarities between East Texas and parts of Central Texas,
âit is not possible to confidently state that any of these samples are Caddo,â but CT 2 INAA group is
indistinguishable from the âTitusâ INAA group (i.e., Sabine and Big Cypress areas of East Texas).

Annâs Cave
Annâs Cave is a rock shelter in the North Bosque River valley, just north of the community of Valley
Mills, Texas. In addition to well-preserved animal bones and perishable organic remains, three ancestral
Caddo grog-tempered sherds are in the collection from the site at the Mayborn Museum Complex at
Baylor University. One is a plain body sherd, another has three or more rows of fingernail punctations,
and the last sherd has an exterior red-slipped and burnished surface.

Brown County
41BR307
The one grog-bone-tempered body sherd in the TARL collections from an ancestral Caddo vessel at
this site has parallel engraved lines. Its age is uncertain, other than to postdate ca. A.D. 900.

Burnet County
Grelle (41BT1)
The Grelle site sherd collection at TARL has Leon Plain bone-tempered sherds, thick (>10.0 mm)
plain bone-tempered ceramic sherds, and an ancestral Caddo plain body sherd. This sherd has grog
temper and a sandy paste, and is 10.2 mm thick. The thickness of the sherd suggests it may be from
a Williams Plain vessel, most commonly manufactured in the northern part of East Texas, as well as
eastern Oklahoma, during the Woodland period (see Ellis 2013), although it was still being made in the
Formative Caddo period (ca. A.D. 800-1000).

Coke County
41CK66
This Colorado River alluvial terrace site at the Humble Crossing Recreation Area at Lake Spence has
eight brushed sherds from an ancestral Caddo manufactured jar. Found along with these vessel sherds
was a possible Caddo bowl (n=87 sherds) from a bulldozed/stock tank area.

Pavo Site (41CK120)
The Caddo ceramic vessel sherds from the Pavo site include two plain body sherds from a grogtempered vessel and another sherd with appliqued elements, probably from a Late Caddo period, Titus
phase, Harleton Appliqued vessel (see Shafer 1969:71 and Figure 39k-l). The Pavo site is located on an
alluvial terrace of the Colorado River.

Coleman County
Millard Collection
Three sherds in the Millard Collection are from ancestral Caddo vessels. One is a plain grogtempered rim (INAA, UT00167), another is a Maydelle Incised body sherd with diagonal and opposed
incised lines (INAA, UT00168), and a third is a grog-tempered body sherd from a Keno Trailed vessel
with parallel trailed lines (INAA, UT00165).

Frank Mills Collection
The Frank Mills collection from Coleman County has a brushed-punctated jar with an everted rim
and small handles (Smith 1936:Plate 15:1). The rim has three horizontal rows of tool punctations above a
vessel body with vertical brushing marks that extend to the vessel base. This ancestral Caddo vessel has
been identified as Bullard Brushed by Suhm and Jelks (1962:Plate 11b).

Concho County
Currie (41CC131)
Aboriginal ceramic sherds were relatively common (n=700) in Cultural Unit 2 at the Currie site
(41CC131), located on an alluvial terrace of the Concho River a short distance upstream from its
confluence with the Colorado River (Treece et al. 1993:119). Radiocarbon dates from this component
date from the 16th century A.D. (Treece et al. 1993:Table 4.23). Of the 700 sherds at the Currie site, there
are two engraved sherds with parallel or vertical lines, at least one with an apparent red slip bounded
by two engraved lines (Treece et al. 1993:Figure 4.34d-e, g). A third sherd is described as having crosshatched incised lines filled with red paint (Treece et al. 1003:208 and Figure 4.34f). It is much more
likely that this sherd is engraved, and has had a red clay pigment rubbed in the engraved lines; this is a
very common embellishment on Caddo fine ware ceramics in East Texas. Another body sherd has a series
of vertical incised lines on the vessel body (Treece et al. 1993:Figure 4.34c). The decorative elements
on these sherds are consistent with ancestral Caddo ceramics, and the fact that they are bone-tempered
would not exclude them from consideration because bone-tempered ceramics were commonly produced
by Caddo potters in the Sabine and Angelina river basins in East Texas.
Treece et al. (1993:207) also note that the assemblage has 16 bone-tempered sherds with grass
or brush impressions. These sherds may also be from an ancestral Caddo vessel or vessels, perhaps
originating in the Late Caddo bone-tempered brushed tradition wares made after ca. A.D. 1400 in the
mid-Sabine and Angelina River basins (see Figure 9).

Coryell County
Grimes-Houy Shelter (41CV17)
The Grimes-Houy shelter is above a spring pool on a tributary of Horse Creek, itself a tributary to the
Leon River (Figure 16); the confluence of Horse Creek and the Leon River is ca. 0.3 km to the west of
the shelter (Miller and Jelks 1952:190). The shelter is ca. 18 m in length, 1.8-4.6 m in width, and width
a ceiling height of 1.8-3.6 m. The River Basin Survey (RBS) archaeologists excavated in the shelter in
January 1951.
A total of 26 ceramic sherds are in the TARL collections from the Grimes-Houy Shelter. Almost 70
percent (n=18) are from vessels tempered with grog, and the remaining 31 percent are from grog-bonetempered vessels. Ten sherds are plain body sherds from either grog- (n=5) or grog-bone-tempered (n=5)
vessels. The remaining 16 sherds are from the decorated portions of utility ware vessels. Miller and
Jelks (1952:191) noted that Darl Hill had recovered sherds from a vessel âvery similar to one from the
Clements Site in Cass County [41CS25] which was found in association with European trade material.
The fragments were found by Mr. Hill within a very restricted space and the vessel they represent was
probably grave furniture included with one of the burialsâ at the site. Unfortunately, Miller and Jelks
(1952) do not describe or illustrate the vessel sherds recovered by Mr. Hill. The Clements (41CS25)

site is a Nasoni Caddo cemetery in the eastern part of the Big Cypress Creek basin in the East Texas
Pineywoods. The decorative styles and distinctive vessel forms represented in the ceramic vessel
assemblage from the site suggest that the burials dated from ca. A.D. 1680-1730, in the early Historic
Caddo period (Perttula 2015b).
There are decorated body sherds with parallel brushing marks (n=5), parallel brushed-incised marks
and lines (n=5), parallel brushing marks with parallel and overlying incised lines (n=1), and parallel
incised lines (n=2). These are likely from Maydelle Incised and Bullard Brushed vessels (Suhm and Jelks
1962). Three rim and upper body sherds have three horizontal rows of tool punctations on the rim and
diagonal opposed brushed-incised marks and lines on the upper vessel body. Notably, about 88 percent of
the decorated utility ware sherds from the Grimes-Houy Shelter are from brushed vessels.

Grimes-Houy Burned Rock Midden (41CV21)
The Grimes-Houy Burned Rock Midden site is atop a canyon wall, ca. 60 m northwest of the GrimesHouy Shelter (Miller and Jelks 1952:192). The burned rock midden was ca. 15 x 9 m in length and width, with
deposits a maximum of 0.6 m in depth. RBS excavations took place in February and March 1951. Miller and
Jelks (1952:195) noted that the sherds recovered in the excavations were from 0-30 cm bs, and âall appear to
be of Caddoan [sic] styles. Five sherds from one vessel were identified as type Holly Fine Engraved, and at
least two more vessels were represented by a series of brushed and plain sherds.â The Holly Fine Engraved
vessel sherds were found in the top 30 cm of the burned rock midden, along with brushed and plain sherds
(Miller and Jelks 1952:195); the presence of the Holly Fine Engraved as well as the brushed sherds indicate
that the shelter was occupied in both ca. A.D. 900-1200 and post-A.D. 1200 times.
The TARL collection of ceramic vessel sherds from the Grimes-Houy Burned Rock Midden includes
67 sherds from plain, utility, and fine ware vessels (Table 10). About 61 percent of the sherds are from
grog-tempered vessels, another 32.8 percent are from grog-bone-tempered vessels, and 6 percent are
from bone-tempered vessels. There are also two ceramic pipe sherds in the collection from the site.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ43
The most distinctive of the utility ware sherds from the Grimes-Houy Burned Rock Midden are the
rim and body sherds from Early Caddo period Weches Fingernail Impressed, var. Weches (see Stokes and
Woodring 1981:184-185) jars. These vessel sherds have horizontal incised panels on the rim filled with
single rows of crescent-shaped fingernail punctations (Figure 17a-b) One Weches Fingernail Impressed, var.
Weches rim and upper body sherd also has rows of fingernail punctations on the upper body (Figure 17c).

Figure 17. Weches Fingernail Impressed sherds from the GrimesHouy Burned Rock Midden site.
Dunkin Incised rim and body sherds are also common in the utility wares. These include rim and
body sherds with diagonal opposed incised lines (Figure 18a-c), and another body sherd with diagonal
opposed incised lines that originate along a vertical incised line (Figure 18d). One other Dunkin Incised
sherd has closely-spaced diagonal opposed incised lines on the rim above a single row of tool punctations
at the rim-body juncture (Figure 18g). Other Dunkin Incised sherds in the Grimes-Houy Burned Rock
Midden collection have diagonal incised lines pitched from left to right across the rim.

Figure 18. Selected decorative elements on utility ware sherds from the
Grimes-Houy Burned Rock Midden site.

44ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Two incised-punctated rim sherds have triangular incised zones filled with rows of tool punctations
(see Figure 18e-f). Three rim and body sherds have rows of either tool or fingernail punctations (see
Table 10). One sherd, probably from a Hollyknowe Pinched vessel (cf. Webb and McKinney 1975), or
less likely from a Killough Pinched vessel, has parallel rows of pinched ridges. Lastly, there is a single
body sherd in the collection from a Bullard Brushed vessel with parallel brushing marks.
The fine ware sherds in the Grimes-Houy Burned Rock Midden ceramic assemblage (see Table 11)
are from engraved bottles, bowls, and carinated bowls. The one engraved bottle sherd has sets of fine
curvilinear engraved lines (Figure 19e), and it likely from a Holly Fine Engraved bottle (see Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plate 40e, g). Carinated bowl rim sherds have horizontal and diagonal engraved lines (Figure
19a), cross-hatched and diagonal opposed engraved lines, horizontal and diagonal opposed engraved
lines (Figure 19d), as well as horizontal engraved lines with pendant hatched zones (Figure 19b).

Figure 19. Selected decorative elements on fine ware sherds from the Grimes-Houy Burned Rock
Midden site.
A large grog-tempered bowl rim sherd from the site has a single row of engraved triangle elements
(see Figure 19f). Another grog-tempered vessel sherd is decorated with a curvilinear engraved line as
well as a narrow curvilinear engraved zone filled with finely engraved cross-hatched engraved lines (see
Figure 19g). One body sherd has curvilinear engraved lines and a curvilinear hatched zone (see Figure
19c), and these decorative elements resemble the decorative elements on a Poynor Engraved, var. Cook
vessel (see Perttula 2011:Figure 6-64).
The first of the pipe sherds from the Grimes-Houy Burned Rock Midden is a plain and grog-tempered
long-stemmed pipe stem and bowl fragment 6.1 mm in thickness. This sherd may be from an Early
Caddo period Graves Chapel variety of the Red River pipe (Hoffman 1967:9). The second sherd is from a
bone-tempered elbow pipe, and it comprises much of the elbow pipe bowl (Figure 20). The elbow pipe is
at least 45 mm in height, has a 26.5 mm orifice diameter, a flat lip, with bowl walls that are 5.4 mm thick.
The pipe bowl is decorated with three discontinuous horizontal engraved lines at the top of the bowl

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ45
(Figure 20), analogous to the Var. B elbow pipe form found in upper Neches
River basin Caddo sites dating from ca. A.D. 1400-1560 (Perttula 2011:215 and
Figure 6-23), except that the Grimes-Houy Burned Rock Midden pipe has a
much taller bowl.

Urbankte (41CV26)
The Urbankte site is on the Leon River in Coryell County, at Belton
Reservoir; the Leon River is a southward-flowing tributary to the Brazos
River (Miller and Jelks 1952) (Figure 21). The Urbankte site ceramics (n=118
sherds) examined at TARL were heavily bone-tempered (88 percent) and
had a considerable proportion of brushed sherds (46 percent of the decorated
sherds) (Perttula 2015); Miller and Jelks (1952:190) noted that ceramic sherds
were âunusually numerous for a Central Texas site.â Both characteristics were
consistent with a post A.D. 1200-1300 Prairie Caddo occupation, as was the fact
that eight of the nine arrow points in the TARL collections from the Urbankte
site are Perdiz arrow points. The common occurrence of both Perdiz points and
brushed ceramic sherds (see Perttula 2013) suggested then that this reputed
Prairie Caddo occupation at the Urbankte site took place sometime after ca. A.D.
1200-1300.

46ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
The 118 ceramic sherds in the TARL collections are from both plain ware, utility ware, and fine
ware bowls and jars (Table 12). According to Miller and Jelks (1952:190), â[m]ost of the sherds are
too fragmentary for positive typological identification, but the ceramic assemblage as a whole is
unquestionably Caddoan [sic].â The two plain ware rims have direct profiles and rounded lips. The bone
and grog temper in the vessel sherds was described as large in size and coarse, not finely crushed, as
would be common in East Texas Caddo wares.

Forty-six percent of the decorated sherds are from brushed vessels (see Table 11). These include a
rim (direct profile with a rounded, exterior folded lip) with horizontal brushing marks (Bullard Brushed),
and body sherds with parallel (n=4) and overlapping (n=1) brushing marks on utility ware jar bodies.
Both incised sherds have parallel incised lines. The two punctated sherds both have rows of circular
punctations.
The principal decorated rim and body sherds are from Pennington Punctated-Incised vessels with
zoned incised diagonals and triangular elements filled with triangular-shaped tool punctations (Figure
22). There are also likely body sherds from contemporaneous Davis Incised and Dunkin Incised vessels
(see Suhm and Jelks 1962) in the collection. There are three engraved fine ware sherds of unidentified
type in the Urbankte site ceramic collection (see Table 11 and Figure 23), all from bone-tempered
vessels. Two have either parallel or straight lines, while the third sherd has horizontal and vertical
opposed engraved lines; these may be the three sherds identified as Holly Fine Engraved by Miller and
Jelks (1952:190). The ceramic sherds from the earlier Prairie Caddo component at the Urbankte site are
from a ca. A.D. 900-1200 occupation.
In addition to ceramic artifacts, there are nine arrow points in the TARL collections from the
Urbankte site. They include eight Perdiz arrow points and one Scallorn arrow point on local Central
Texas cherts. The common occurrence of both Perdiz points and brushed ceramic sherds suggests that at
least part of the occupation at the Urbankte site took place sometime after ca. A.D. 1200-1300.

Shaferâs collection of ceramic sherds from the Urbankte site
(Perttula and Shafer 2016:48) came from a component shallowly
buried in the bank of Horse Creek. The ceramic sherds from the
earlier Prairie Caddo component at the Urbankte site are from a
ca. A.D. 900-1200 occupation. The principal decorated rim and
body sherds are from Pennington Punctated-Incised vessels
with zoned incised diagonals and triangular elements filled with
triangular-shaped tool punctations (see Figure 22). There are
also likely body sherds from contemporaneous Davis Incised
and Dunkin Incised vessels (see Suhm and Jelks 1962) in the
collection.

In summary, the Urbankte site was evidently occupied by
Prairie Caddo groups on at least two occasions, one between ca. A.D. 900-1200 (contemporaneous
with the Early Caddo period in East Texas) and the other sometime after ca. A.D. 1200-1300,
contemporaneous with either the Middle or Late Caddo periods in East Texas. The earlier of the two
components had early Caddo period ceramic sherds from Pennington Punctated-Incised and Davis
Incised vessels, Bonham-Alba arrow points, and a Gahagan biface. The later component at the Urbankte
site was characterized by numerous Perdiz arrow points, many bone-tempered ceramic vessels, and a
considerable proportion of brushed sherds from utility ware vessels.

48ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Ament Shelter (41CV33)
Ancestral Caddo ceramics were recovered in excavations by Darl Hill, not by the River Basin
Surveys (Miller and Jelks 1952:198). Ceramic sherds from the shelter included several from Holly Fine
Engraved vessels (Miller and Jelks 1952:Plate 29:1-6), as well as sherds from at least one other vessel
(although not specified by Miller and Jelks [1952:201). They do illustrate a Late Caddo Frankston phase
decorated elbow pipe recovered by Hill (Miller and Jelks (1952:Plate 29:8), namely a Var. B ceramic
elbow pipe bowl (Var. B, see Perttula 2011) from the shelter.

Ament Midden (41CV34)
This Leon River site had been looted by Darl Hill in the early 1950s. In 1959, Harry J. Shafer visited
the site on several occasions, and excavated a 1 x 1 m unit in the large burned rock midden; the midden
was across from the Ament Shelter (41CV33); as mentioned above, there were ceramic sherds found
in the shelter deposits as well as a ceramic pipe (Miller and Jelks 1952:201). Caddo ceramic sherds
were recovered by Shafer from the midden excavations (Harry J. Shafer, August 12, 2015 personal
communication), and the collections were subsequently donated to TARL. A ceramic pipe bowl sherd
was also found in the site by another collector.
The collection of ceramic vessel sherds from the Ament Midden site at
TARL includes 16 sherds from grog- (n=10), grog-bone- (n=3), and bonetempered (n=3) vessels. Eleven sherds are plain, among them four rims, six
body sherds, and one grog-bone-tempered base sherd; one of the rims is
from a carinated bowl.
The five decorated sherds are body sherd from grog-tempered utility
ware vessels. One body sherd has a circular appliqued node, one sherd has
parallel incised lines, another sherd has parallel incised lines above a row
of tool punctations, a body sherd with rows of fingernail punctations, and a
body sherd with a set of curvilinear incised lines (Figure 24).

Aboriginal sites with ceramic sherds at Fort Hood are not at all common, with less than 150 sherds
known from only 12 archaeological sites, or about 1 percent of the sites recorded on the fort (Weinstein
2015:24 and Table 3-4) at the facility; two sites (41BL183 and 41CV144) have more than 70 percent of the
sherds. Both Toyah phase Leon Plain and ancestral Caddo ceramic wares are present in these assemblages,
beginning ca. A.D. 900 in the case of Caddo wares, and after ca. A.D. 1200 in the case of the bone-tempered
Toyah phase wares. Several sites have engraved Caddo wares that were made between ca. A.D. 900-1600.
41CV41-A is on the Fort Hood Military Reservation in the Leon River basin, and has a Toyah phase
component. There are ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds from two different vessels, one rim sherd
from an incised vessel (Abbott and Trierweiler 1995:Table 8-17), and seven sherds from a grog-hematitetempered Taylor Engraved bottle with cross-hatched engraved zones and curvilinear scroll lines with
pendant triangles (Figure 25). If accurately identified, Taylor Engraved vessels in East Texas Caddo
sites (commonly found in sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin and parts of the Red River basin) were
apparently made and used between ca. A.D. 1550-1680.

41CV48
This aboriginal site at Fort Hood is on an alluvial terrace of Owl Creek in the Leon River basin.
Excavations recovered sherds from two different vessels in a Toyah phase component, including eight sherds
from a thick grog-tempered parallel brushed vessel (Trierweiler 1996:168 and Figure 5.56). Petrographic
analysis of the brushed vessel indicates that it is an ancestral Caddo vessel, likely a Bullard Brushed vessel,
and Trierweiler (1996:168-169) suggests that the brushed sherds may represent use of the Fort Hood area by
âpeoples from Northeastern Texas who made brushed ceramics with grog additives. Alternately, the latter
may have been a trade vessel as there is no indication of peoples from the northeastern region.â Trierweiler
(1996:573) goes on to speculate about whether the brushed ceramics are from âeither an East Texas influenced
Toyah group or an actual utilization of the Fort Hood area by an East Texas group.â

Stone Rockshelter (41CV61)
Fifteen sherds recovered in excavations at the Stone Rockshelter on Hog Creek include five grogtempered sherds that are either exterior burnished or have incised elements from a Maydelle Incised
vessel. One sandy paste sherd has exterior brushing marks (Henry et al. 1980). The brushed sherd and
Maydelle Incised vessel sherd suggests the occupation at the rockshelter postdates ca. A.D 1200, and
most likely dates to the time of the Frankston phase in East Texas, after ca. A.D. 1400.

L. F. Robertson Shelter (41CV62)
The eight sherds recovered from the archaeological deposits at the L. F. Robertson Shelter include
grog-tempered and sandy paste wares. The few decorated sherds are from post-A.D. 1200 Caddo Bullard
Brushed jars (Henry et al. 1980).

50ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Unreported Fort Hood Site in the Vicinity of 41CV92
A single grog-tempered rim sherd from a carinated
bowl was reported by Thomas (1978:208; see also
Perttula 2003:21) from a bluff slope landform near the
south bank of the Leon River, and ca. 2 km northwest
of 41CV92. The rim panel has a set of vertical columns
that are either filled with cross-hatched lines or open,
along with larger areas filled with a series of semicircular engraved lines (Figure 26). The combination
of vertical panels and semi-circular engraved lines is
a notable feature of Middle Caddo period sites in the
middle Sabine River basin, as well as certain later
Poynor Engraved motifs and elements seen on upper
Neches River basin ceramic vessels (see Perttula
2011:Figure 6-65).

41CV344

Figure 26. Decorative elements on engraved
rim sherd from unreported site near 41CV92.

This site is on Owl Creek in the Leon River basin at Fort
Hood (Perttula et al. 2003:21-22 and Figure 1). Sherds from
three different vessels have been recovered at the site that
appear to be from an ancestral Caddo bottle (Vessel 4) (Figure
27), a jar or deep bowl (Vessel 1), and a carinated bowl (Vessel
3). Vessels 1 and 3 are plain sections of vessels that have been
grog-tempered, while Vessel 4 is a grog-tempered engraved
bottle (Perttula et al. 2003:Figure 9). The decorative elements
on the bottle include rectilinear engraved lines with a series of

engraved bottle has been recovered at the Asa Warner site
on the Brazos River in ca. A.D. 1200-1400 archaeological
deposits (see Turner 1997:Figure 10), as well as from Middle Caddo period contexts in sites in both the
middle Sabine and upper Neches River basins in East Texas.

41CV960
This site, on a terrace of Cowhouse Creek at Fort Hood, has a single grog-tempered ancestral
Caddo ceramic sherd (Abbott and Trierweiler 1995:491). The sherd is plain, but polished on both vessel
surfaces, suggests it is from a carinated bowl. Petrographic analysis by Reese-Taylor (1995) âsuggests it
was a Caddoan [sic]-influence or traded, Caddoan [sic] grog-tempered vesselâ (Abbott and Trierweiler
1995:491).

41CV1038
According to Mehalchick et al. (2003:243), eight brushed ceramic vessel sherds have been recovered
in investigations at this site at Fort Hood. Found along with the brushed sherds was a single plain bonetempered sherd.

Wattâs Sites No. 10-12
In a list of aboriginal sites in the central Brazos River basin with ceramic sherds, Watt (1953:84 and
Figure 26) lists three sites in the Leon River basin that have ancestral Caddo ceramic vessels. These are
No. 10 on Coryell Creek, No. 11 on the Leon River, and No. 12 on a tributary of the Leon River. Between
them, the three sites had 13 sherds from post-A.D. 1400 Late Caddo Frankston phase vessels of the
Poynor Engraved and Bullard Brushed types.

Chrisnerâs Ranch
The Chrisnerâs ranch site is in southern Coryell County, on an alluvial landform in the Leon River
basin (Marcus Whittle, 2017 personal communication). Ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds of
apparent Late Caddo, Frankston phase affiliation have been found in three areas of the site. Ceramic
sherds known to come from Locality I include three grog-tempered body sherds, one with parallel to
overlapping brushed marks (Bullard Brushed) and two with parallel incised lines. Locality II has 20
ancestral Caddo grog (n=14) and grog-bone (n=6)-tempered sherds. Fourteen body sherds have parallel
brushing marks, two has opposed brushing marks, and one has overlapping brushing marks. All of these
are from Bullard Brushed vessels, as well as a lower rim-body sherd with a thumbnail punctated row at
the rim-body juncture and horizontal-diagonal brushing on the vessel body.
Locality III has 15 sherds from a single Hume Engraved short-necked bottle (Figure 28a). The bottle
is tempered with grog and bone, and has been fired and cooled in a reducing environment. Vessel walls
are 10.2 mm thick. The engraved design consists of two sets of closely-spaced horizontal engraved
lines under the lip and at the base of the neck. Between these, and then bisecting them, are several sets
of vertical engraved lines (Figure 28b) and a single zig-zag engraved line. If this vessel was made in
the upper Neches River basin, which is likely given the distinctive vessel shape (see Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plate 42e), it signifies use of the Chrisnerâs ranch site after ca. A.D. 1480, when Hume Engraved
vessels began to be commonly made and used by ancestral Caddo peoples in this part of East Texas (see
Perttula 2011).
It addition to the brushed and engraved sherds in the Chrisnerâs Ranch ceramic assemblage, there
is another utility ware in the collection from the site, but its Locality is not known. This sherd is from a
Maydelle Incised jar with incised triangles filled with diagonal opposed incised lines (Figure 29).

C-34
This unrecorded site is a rock shelter in the Leon River basin in Coryell County that was investigated
by Cecil Calhoun in 1947; he also investigated nearby 41CV20, a rock shelter with a Perdiz arrow point
and perishable artifacts (in the collections of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), but
containing no ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds. A June 1967 letter from Calhoun to TARL indicates
that âa few East Texas sherds have been foundâ in the C-34 rock shelter deposits. Unfortunately, no
details were provided by Calhoun concerning the kinds of vessel sherds they were.

Gun Cornfield (39C3-3/C3-15)
There are seven rim and body sherds from ancestral Caddo vessels in Frank Wattâs collection from
the Gun Cornfield site. Five of the sherds are plain, including a grog-tempered rim sherd and four body
sherds; these are from grog- (n=3) and bone- (n=1) tempered vessels. One of the two decorated sherds is
a grog-tempered body sherd from a Bullard Brushed vessel with parallel brushing marks, and the other

is a grog-tempered lower rim sherd from a La Rue Neck Banded jar. The origin of these sherds-vessels is
likely Frankston phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1680) sites in the upper Neches River basin in East Texas.

Frank Simmons/McLeod Farm (39C3-7)
Frank Watt collected seven ceramic sherds from at least three Caddo vessels at the Frank Simmons/
McLeod Farm site. Six of the seven sherds are from grog-tempered Bullard Brushed vessels, and the
other sherd from a Bullard Brushed vessel has bone temper. All of the grog-tempered sherds have either
opposed (n=1) or parallel brushing (n=5) marks (Figure 30a), and the bone-tempered body sherd has
opposed brushed-incised marks and lines (Figure 30b).

K. H. Aynesworth CollectionâKinsey Farm Spring
This unrecorded site is in the Leon River basin not far from Gatesville, Texas, and the Fort Hood
Military Reservation. The collection has four plain grog-tempered body and base sherds from an
ancestral Caddo vessel of uncertain form.

Johnson Hole
Excavations by Miller and Jelks (1952:197) at the Johnson Hole site on the Leon River at Lake
Belton recovered a single Holly Fine Engraved sherd in an Austin phase context. Holly Fine Engraved
vessels were manufactured by East Texas Caddo potters between ca. A.D. 900-1200.

Dimmit County
41DM134
Although this site is in South Texas (see Figures 1-2), in the
southwestern part of Dimmit County, it is worth mentioning in
this report because the site has a sherd from an ancestral Caddo
Maydelle Incised jar (Figure 31). This is the southernmost
occurrence of Caddo ceramic vessel sherds in Texas. The rim sherd
has a continuous series of incised triangles that are filled with
incised lines pitched in opposite directions.

Texarkana phase ancestral Caddo components along the Red River in Bowie County, Texas (see Suhm
and Jelks 1962:97 and Plate 49).

Hamilton County
Jayroe Site (41HM51)
The ceramic analyses by Gadus (n.d.) of the Jayroe site (41HM51) sherds identified 43 sherds that
could be sorted into seven different groups of sherds, from 1 to 12 sherds per group (Table 13). Three
of the sherd groups were considered to be part of three different vessels (Vessels No. 1-3) and the four
groups of miscellaneous sherds may be part of Vessel No. 1 (sherd groups a and b on Table 13) or from
other undefined vessel sherd groups.
Vessels No. 1 and No. 2, as well as miscellaneous sherd groups a, b, and d, have decorative elements,
while the sherds from Vessel No. 3 may be from a plain olla-like vessel and miscellaneous sherd group c
is a flat base sherd (see Table 13). Each of the sherd groups are from vessels tempered either with grog
or grog-bone; Vessels No. 1 and No. 3 have both tempers, as do miscellaneous sherd groups a and c.
Vessel No. 1 is a jar that has a series of horizontal incised lines on the rim (see Gadus n.d.:Figure
1a-b). It is possible that miscellaneous sherd groups a and b represent the diagonal brushed body of
Vessel No. 1 (see Gadus n.d.:Figure 1c-e), and sherd group c the base (see Gadus n.d.:Figure 1f). These
kinds of decorative elements are common features of East Texas Caddo ceramics, especially on utility
ware vessels in the Neches-Angelina River basins (see Perttula 2013). Sherds from brushed utility ware
vessels, particularly jars, are a distinctive characteristic of both Middle (ca. A.D. 1200-1400), Late (ca.
A.D. 1400-1680), and Historic (post-A.D. 1680) Caddo sites in much of East Texas. It also appears to be
the case that the relative proportions of brushed utility wares increase through time in those areas where

brushed vessels were made and used, such that sherds with brushing marks may comprise as much as
90 percent of all the decorated sherds in some post-A.D. 1400 East Texas ceramic assemblages. In the
East Texas Caddo ceramic sherd database, only a few ca. A.D. 1200-1430 sites have assemblages with
high proportions (>60 percent of the decorated sherd assemblage) of brushed sherds; these occur in the
mid-Sabine and Big Cypress Creek drainage basins (see Perttula 2015a:Table 1). Late Caddo ceramic
assemblages in East Texas with high proportions of brushed sherds occur in the upper and mid-Neches
(Frankston phase sites), Angelina, middle Sabine and Big Cypress (Titus phase sites), and sites (of
unknown cultural taxonomy) on tributaries of the Sabine River west of the Toledo Bend Reservoir area
(Perttula 2015a:Figure 5). Caddo ceramic assemblages without considerable amounts of brushed sherds
occur in the upper Sabine, Sulphur, and Red River basins (Figure 32).
The fact that there is little bone added to the paste of Vessel No. 1 (and associated miscellaneous
sherd groups) also suggests that these sherds, if made by an East Texas Caddo potter, were made by
a potter in only certain parts of East Texas. The use of burned animal bone for the temper of ceramic
vessels is a distinctive characteristic of certain East Texas Caddo ceramic sherd assemblages, and most
ceramic assemblages in the region have some bone-tempered sherds (see Perttula 2015a:Table 1).
However, sherd assemblages with high proportions (>40 percent of the sherd assemblage) of bone temper
are concentrated in only a few locales across East Texas, most notably in the Toledo Bend Reservoir area
along the middle Sabine River and in sites in the Angelina River basin (see Figure 9). Bone-tempered

56ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas

Figure 32. The distribution of areas in East Texas with high proportions of brushed Caddo ceramic
vessels and sherds.
sherds are not a notable feature of Caddo ceramic assemblages in the Neches, upper Sabine, Big Cypress,
Sulphur, or Red River basins.
Pre-A.D. 1400/1450 Caddo sites with a high proportion of bone temper are found only in a few areas
in the middle Sabine River basin. Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 1400-1680) sites and assemblages with high
proportions of bone temper are found in one site in the Trinity River basin, and in several sites in the
mid-Sabine and Angelina River basins. In fact, these sites are part of a previously identified Late Caddo
bone-tempered and brushed ceramic tradition (see Figure 9; see also Perttula 2011:Figure 6-71). Vessel
No. 1 at the Jayroe site is apparently from a Late Caddo period grog-tempered and brushed ceramic
tradition apparently centered either in the upper Neches (in Frankston phase sites) and/or upper Sabine
River (in Titus phase sites) basins, although brushed pottery is much less common in upper Sabine River
Titus phase sites than it is in upper Neches River basin Caddo communities.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ57
Vessel No. 2 from the Jayroe site is an everted rim and grog-tempered jar with curvilinear appliqued
ridges (see Gadus n.d.:Figure 2a-b). A fingernail punctated rim (miscellaneous sherd group d) may also
be part of Vessel No. 2. The decorative elements are clearly consistent with the Harleton Appliqued type
(see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 33). This is a common utility ware in Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. A.D.
1430-1680) sites in the upper Sabine and Big Cypress drainage basins in East Texas (see Perttula 2013);
Caddo vessels in these areas were typically grog-tempered.
Vessel 3 includes sherds from the rim and neck of an olla-like vessel (see Table 13). The sherds
included with this vessel by Gadus (n.d.:Figure 2d-e) are grog- or grog-bone-tempered. As Kenmotsu
and Boyd (2012:12) note, ollas âwith somewhat constricted mouthâ are one of the four known Toyah
phase vessel types, but they are bone-tempered. Ollas were also made by East Texas Caddo potters
(see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plates 3j, 14b-d, 37e, 38n, 41g, I, 59k, 65k-l, and 78k), in Late Caddo Titus
phase, McCurtain phase, and post-A.D. 1680 Historic Caddo period contexts. These ollas usually have
plain rims (but see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 59k), but have decorated bodies, either with engraved or
brushed decorative elements.
The petrographic analysis of 11 sherds from the Jayroe site (Barkwill-Love n.d.) led to the
identification of two different petrographic groupsâGroup 1 with one sherd from Vessel No. 2, and two
sherds from miscellaneous sherd group b, thought to be part of Vessel No. 1âand Group 2 with two
sherds from Vessel No. 1 (see Table 13). Most of the sherds (n=6) were not assigned to a petrographic
group; these include two sherds from Vessel No. 2, two sherds from Vessel No. 3, and single sherds
from miscellaneous sherd groups a and c; the latter two sherd groups are thought by Gadus (n.d.) to
be part of Vessel No. 1. As detected in the petrographic analysis, the ubiquity of grog as a temper in
the manufacture of vessels used at the Jayroe site, and the almost complete absence of bone temper, is
particularly notable with respect to considerations of vessel sherd provenance.
All of the sherds analyzed by petrography have grog temper, ranging from 1.5 to 10.2 percent of the
point counts (see Barkwill-Love n.d.). The highest proportion of grog temper is in the two Vessel No. 1
sherds and the base sherd comprising miscellaneous sherd group c.
Only four of the analyzed sherds from the Jayroe site have bone in the paste. Of these, only the one
sherd in sherd miscellaneous group a (see Table 13) has bone (a very low 0.4 percent of the point counts)
inclusions added as temper. The other three sherdsâfrom Vessel No. 1 and miscellaneous sherd group
câhave bone in pieces of grog, indicating that they came from ground-up sherds from another vessel that
had bone temper.
It is disconcerting that sherds sorted by Gadus (n.d.) into vessel groups fall into more than
one petrographic group. In the case of Vessel No. 1, two sherds are in Petrographic Group 2, but
miscellaneous sherd groups a-c, thought to also be part of Vessel No. 1, have been grouped by BarkwillLove into either Petrographic Group 1 or an unidentified petrographic group. Similarly, the three sherds
from Vessel No. 2 analyzed by petrography have been assigned to either Group 1 or an unidentified
petrographic group. These results suggest that the vessel sherd sorting of Vessels No. 1âand the
miscellaneous sherd groups thought to also be part of Vessel No. 1âand No. 2 may not be of particular
utility, and/or that the petrographic groupings based on sand size, the proportion of angular sandy grains,
and paste colorationâinstead of the presence of grog, bone, hematite, and mica in the point countsâare
likely not critical to petrographic group identifications.

58ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
The instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of split samples of the 11 sherds analyzed by
petrography from the Jayroe site was completed by Ferguson and Glascock (n.d.). The chemical constituents
of the 11 sherds led to the identification of three INAA groups: Groups A, B. and C (see Table 13).
In comparing the INAA results from the Jayroe site to the 15 previously defined Central Texas
chemical groups (see Creel et al. 2013:47-49), Group A sherds (a Vessel No. 1 sherd and sherds from
miscellaneous sherd groups a-c) from the Jayroe site are distinct from all the reference groups except
Group 15, although Ferguson and Glascock (n.d.) note that these âsamples differentiate from Group 15 in
numerous other Bivariate plots.â Creel et al. (2013:53 and Figure 17) have commented that other Group
15 sherds are from sites along the Colorado River in the Edwards Plateau, well to the south and west of
the Jayroe site.
The Group B sherds from Jayroe (one punctated rim sherd thought to be from Vessel No. 2, two
sherds from Vessel No. 3, and one brushed sherd in miscellaneous sherd group a, thought to be from
Vessel No. 1) are chemically most similar to Central Texas chemical groups 10 and 11 (Ferguson and
Glascock n.d.), âwith a slightly stronger match with Group 11.â According to Creel et al. (2013:Figures
20 and 24), the Group 10 and 11 sherds are primarily from sites in the Edwards Plateau and the Gulf
Coastal Plain well south and west of the Jayroe site, and include many Leon Plain, Goliad Plain (see
Hester 1989; Mounger 1959:163-181), untyped bone-tempered plain, and untyped sandy paste plain
sherds. One sherd from Group 10C is a Boothe Brushed sherd from a site in the Colorado River basin
south of the Jayroe site (Creel et al. 2013:61 and Figure 23). Creel et al. (2013:60) also comment that
a number of Caddo pottery sherd samples in the Central Texas INAA database âhave high probabilities
of membership in Group 10,â but significantly they also note that there is a âconsiderable overlap
between Group 10 and most of the previously analyzed Caddo pottery samples from Caddo sites in East
Texas.â Furthermore, even if these sherds have a high probability of membership in Group 10 âdoes not
necessarily imply production of Caddo vessels in Central Texas.â
The INAA Group C sherds from the Jayroe site are from Vessels No. 1 and No. 2; inexplicably, other
sherds from these two vessels have been assigned to other INAA chemical groups: Group A for one sherd
from Vessel No. 1 and Group B for the punctated rim thought to be a part of Vessel No. 2. Ferguson and
Glascock (n.d.) note that the Group C sherds are distinct from âall of the Central Texas Reference Groups
except for Group 8, but many other plots show a clear separation from Group 8.â Creel et al. (2013:59
and Figure 19) suggest that Group 8 sherds have a Balcones Escarpment production zone, well west of
the Jayroe site.
Stylistic, technological, petrographic, and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) has been
completed of a small assemblage of ceramic sherds (n=43) from as few as three separate vessels (Vessels
No. 1-3) from the Jayroe site. The ceramic sherds are associated with a Late Prehistoric Toyah phase (ca.
A.D. 1250-1700) occupation.
The decorative elements on the sherds from Vessels No. 1 and No. 2 are consistent with those on
Caddo utility ware vessels from the Neches, Sabine, and Big Cypress drainage basins in East Texas in
Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 1400-1680) Titus phase and Frankston phase contexts. Vessel No. 3 at the Jayroe
site is the rim and neck of an olla-like vessel. Ollas were also made by Titus phase Caddo groups in the
Sabine and Big Cypress basins. Additionally, Caddo ceramic vessels made in the upper parts of these
three drainage basins are primarily grog-tempered, with little bone being used in vessel manufacture.
The Jayroe site ceramic sherds are from grog-tempered vessels, with very limited use of burned bone
as a temper (and in three of the four sherds with bone, the bone occurred within pieces of grog), and

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ59
thus they share technological and manufacturing practices with East Texas Caddo ceramics rather than
with the primarily bone-tempered (and plain) ceramic vessels thought to have been made locally by East
Central and Central Texas Toyah phase groups (e.g., Creel et al. 2013).
In the case of the INAA of the Jayroe sherds, comparison of the sherds to the Central Texas database
suggests the sherds from the site are associated to Central Texas chemical groups 8, 10/11, and 15.
Except for the Caddo sherds in chemical group 10 that chemically overlap with sherds more likely to be
from vessels made in Central Texas, the sherds included in these chemical groups have Edwards Plateau
and Gulf Coastal Plain production locales well to the south and west of the Jayroe site. These sherds are
primarily from bone-tempered and sandy paste vessels that are stylistically and technologically distinct
from the Jayroe site sherds.
Tomka (n.d.) notes that the Jayroe site sherds were also compared to the East Texas Caddo INAA
database. The Jayroe site sherds were found to be compositionally very similar to the sherds in the
existing Caddo INAA database, and Vessels No. 1 (incised-brushed) and No. 2 (Harleton Appliqued)
were matched with East Texas core chemical groups 4/5 and 9 (Tomka n.d.; see Perttula 2013:Figure 9).
The incised-brushed sherds from Vessel No. 1 are matched with chemical group 9, which include sherds
from the Neches and Angelina River basins; utility ware vessels with the kind of decorative elements
noted on Vessel No. 1 are common in those parts of East Texas. One of the Vessel No. 2 sherds from a
Harleton Appliqued jar, and both sherds from the olla-like Vessel No. 3, at the Jayroe site match with the
East Texas Caddo chemical group 5. This chemical group includes sites in the upper Sabine and Cypress
drainage basins, an area densely occupied by Late Caddo Titus phase Caddo groups.
Based on the preponderance of the evidence gathered in the detailed analysis of the aboriginal sherds
from the Jayroe site, it appears most likely that they are from grog-tempered vessels manufactured by
Caddo potters living in East Texas communities. The decorative elements on Vessel No. 1 and No. 2
are consistent with utility ware vessels made in post-A.D. 1400 Frankston and Titus phase sites in the
Neches, Sabine, and Big Cypress drainage basins (particularly the upper parts of these basins, where
not much bone-tempered Caddo pottery is present), and the INAA comparisons with the existing Caddo
INAA database point to these same areas as the manufacturing locales of the vessels that were eventually
used by non-Caddo groups that lived at the Jayroe site.

Ceramic sherds have been recovered from this site on the Blanco River, including a plain shelltempered sherd of possible Caddo manufacture in the TARL collections. Shell-tempered Caddo pottery is
most commonly found on post-A.D. 1300 sites in McCurtain phase sites in the middle Red River basin,
as well as in post-A.D. 1680 sites in several parts of the Red River basin in East Texas (see Perttula et al.

Excavations at the Barton site (North) near the headwaters of Onion Creek in the Colorado River
basin recovered 18 small sherds from one vessel (a flat-bottomed jar) in the Toyah component at the
site (Ricklis and Collins 1994:225). This vessel is tempered with grog (Reese-Taylor et al. 1994:561)
and has parallel (or vertical) brushing marks on the exterior surface (Ricklis and Collins 1994:Figure
118a). Ricklis and Collins (1994:228) cautiously suggest that this vessel âmay have had a Caddoan [sic]

60ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
originâ after conducting macroscopic and microscopic analyses of the sherds from this site. Reese-Taylor
et al. (1994:566) conclude that âthe grog-tempered, brushed vessel from 41HY202-Aâ would not be out
of place in a Caddoan [sic] assemblage, and this vesselâ¦likely represents transport/importation from
East Texas.â Reese-Taylor et al. (1994:566) go on to conclude that âsome, if not much, of the Caddolike pottery found at Toyah interval sites in Central Texas represent westward transport of actual Caddo
vesselsâ¦and may represent some sort of exchange rather than the actual presence of Caddo people.â
One ancestral Caddo sherd from 41HY202-A in the TARL collection is a grog-tempered body sherd
with parallel brushing marks from the one recovered vessel section described above. This sherd is
from an East Texas vessel that was made by a Caddo potter sometime after ca. A.D. 1200, and after the
beginning of the Toyah phase in Central Texas.

Mustang Branch (41HY209-T)
The Mustang Branch site on Onion Creek has a Toyah phase component that has been radiocarbondated to between A.D. 1453-1654 (Ricklis and Collins 1994:267 and Table 42). Excavations at the site
recovered 480 ceramic vessel sherds divided into five Groups (Ricklis and Collins 1994:262-264). Two of
the groups are sherds from ancestral Caddo vessels, and a third (Group 4) may well also be an ancestral
Caddo ceramic vessel.
The first group is Group 3 (n=5 sherds) from a grog-tempered Poynor Engraved carinated bowl (Ricklis
and Collins 1974:Figure 142a-b). The engraved decorative elements on the rim panel consist of nested
ovals and diagonal cross-hatched ladders, namely Var. F of Poynor Engraved, a regional variety of Poynor
Engraved in the upper Neches River basin in East Texas (Perttula 2011:Figure 6-65). This particular variety
of Poynor Engraved was most commonly manufactured by Caddo potters between ca. A.D. 1400-1480, but
continued to be made from ca. A.D. 1480-1560 (Perttula 2011:Table 6-37).
The second group of sherds from ancestral Caddo vessels at the Mustang Branch site is Group 5 (n=2
sherds). These are from a grog-tempered brushed vessel (Ricklis and Collins 1994:263), likely a Bullard
Brushed vessel.
PIXE analysis of the paste of the Group 3 and 5 sherds indicates that they can be segregated from what
is considered locally-made ceramic vessels at the Mustang Branch site (Ricklis and Collins 1994:266).
Group 4 had nine sherds from a vessel with a plain rim, other than a horizontal row of tool punctations
at the rim-body juncture, and vertical brushing marks on the vessel body; it is bone-tempered (Ricklis and
Collins 1994:Figure 142c-d). It has been identified as a Boothe Brushed vessel, even though bone-tempered
Bullard Brushed vessels are known from the Caddo area (Suhm and Jelks 1962:21 and Plate 11). PIXE
analysis of the Group 4 sherds, and a sherd from the A. C. Saunders mound site (41AN19) in the upper
Neches River basin suggests that this brushed-punctated vessel may also be of ancestral Caddo origin
(Ricklis and Collins 1994:266).
Three sherds from this site in the TARL collection are from ancestral Caddo vessels, two from vessels
tempered with grog and the other from a vessel tempered with grog and bone. One grog-tempered body
sherd has parallel brushing marks (INAA, UT00101, Group 5 in Ricklis and Collins [1994]), while the
other is a body sherd (INAA, UT00108) with an unidentified engraved element, probably from the postA.D. 1400 Poynor Engraved vessel (Group 3). The grog-bone-tempered body sherd has a row of fingernail
punctations (INAA, UT00099), and this may be from sherd Group 2 (Ricklis and Collins 1994:262-263 and
Figure 141a-b). Reese et al. (1994:566) suggest this vessel was locally produced in Central Texas.

Hill County
Kyle Rockshelter (41HI1)
Ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds at the Kyle site date to Early Caddo period times (ca. A.D.
900-1200). Almost all of them may all be from one grog-tempered Hickory Engraved bottle (INAA,
UT00008) with at least three horizontal engraved lines on the upper vessel body and seven horizontal
engraved lines on the upper bottle neck (Jelks 1962:Figure 24). The bottle neck is 7.6 mm thick, has been
burnished on the exterior surface, and the neck has a 9.0 cm orifice diameter. The vessel has a red slip
on both interior and exterior surfaces, suggesting the red slip was poured into the open bottle to coat the
interior surface before it was fired.
There are four plain grog-tempered body sherds in the Kyle Rockshelter assemblage from another
vessel, and none have a red slip. One of the sherds is burnished on the exterior surface, and may be from
a bowl or carinated bowl, as these often have this sort of interior-exterior surface treatment.

Blum Rockshelter (41HI8)
Excavations by Jelks (1953) at the Blum Rockshelter, overlooking the Nolans River in the Brazos
River basin and the Lake Whitney flood pool, recovered ancestral Caddo sherds (Table 14) from Stratum
2; these sherds are in TARL collections. Archaeological deposits in Stratum 2 are from a Toyah phase
occupation with Perdiz arrow points (Jelks 1953:205). The Caddo sherds are from several vessels that
likely were manufactured after ca. A.D. 1400/1480 by Caddo peoples in the upper Neches River basin in
East Texas.

About 98.5 percent of these sherds are from vessels tempered with grog, either as the sole temper
(74.6 percent), or in conjunction with burned bone (23.9 percent). Only one sherd (1.5 percent) is
tempered solely with burned bone (see Table 14). There are plain grog-tempered rim and body sherds
from at least one vessel that have 20 cm, 22 cm, and 30 cm orifice diameters; one of these vesselsâwith
17 conjoined sherdsâis Vessel 2 identified by Jelks (1953:205).

Eighty percent of the decorated sherds from the Blum Rockshelter are from utility ware vessels,
and most of these have rows of fingernail punctations (Table 15); this is Vessel 4 (Jelks 1953:205). The
incised and incised-punctated sherds are from two different Maydelle Incised vessels; those with incisedpunctated elements (Figure 33c) are from Vessel 3 (Jelks 1953:205).

The fine ware sherds from the Blum Rockshelter are from at least two vessels. The first is a rim sherd
(Vessel 1) from a Poynor Engraved, var. unspecified vessel (see Figure 33a), perhaps var. Cook or var.
Lang (Perttula 2011:Figure 6-64), while the other is an engraved bowl (Vessel 5) with open or vertical
hatched triangle elements on the upper body (see Figure 33b). Similar triangular motifs have been noted
on both post-A.D. 1400 Poynor Engraved and Hume Engraved vessels in upper Neches River Caddo
ceramic assemblages.

Figure 33. Decorative elements on selected sherds from the Blum Rockshelter site.

Stansbury (41HI9)
Stephensonâs work at the Stansbury site in 1947 and 1950 recovered only 18 ceramic sherds from
this late 18th century Wichita habitation site. These are from an ancestral Caddo Womack Engraved
bowl with large hatched pendant triangle elements (Stephenson 1970:76 and Plate 2d), three different
Patton Engraved vessels, and one sherd from a bowl or carinated bowl with an interior slip, and a âsmall,
curved, engraved line on the exteriorâ (Stephenson 1970:78).
One bone-tempered body sherd from the Stansbury site (41HI9) in the TARL collection is from
an ancestral Caddo vessel with opposed engraved lines; the type is uncertain. There is also an exterior
burnished and grog-tempered elbow pipe with a distal knob in the collection that may have been made
by a Caddo group, as such forms are common after ca. A.D. 1300 on East Texas Caddo sites. The elbow
pipe bowl is 8.8 mm in thickness. Another pipe of very similar form, tempered with grog and bone, has
been found at the late 18th century Walton site (41ML65) on the Brazos River (Story 1985:Figure 4a-aâ),
and several examples of similar elbow pipes (of clay or stone) are illustrated by Stephenson (1970:82 and
Plate 3) from River Basin Surveys work at the Stansbury site.

Bear Creek Shelter (41HI17)
One of the three ceramic vessel sherds recovered by Lynott (1978:43, 1980:Table 8) at Bear Creek
Shelter on Aquilla Creek is a plain grog-tempered rim sherd from an ancestral Caddo vessel in a Toyah
phase component. The other two sherds have a sandy paste and limestone temper, and were likely
manufactured locally by aboriginal peoples sometime during the Austin phase, which Lynott (1980:218)
dates from ca. A.D. 500-600 to A.D. 1200.

Lavender (41HI30)
The ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds from the Lavender site, a rock shelter, include two
Weches Fingernail Impressed body sherds (Figure 34), probably var. Weches (see Stokes and Woodring
1981), and eight plain sherds. The Weches Fingernail Impressed sherds are indicative of use from ca.
A.D. 900-1200.

Sour Mash (41HI34)
The ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds from 41HI34 in the TARL collections include only one
plain grog-tempered rim sherd and 46 sherds from utility ware or fine ware vessels (Table 16). About
62 percent of the sherds are from grog-tempered vessels; another 23.4 percent are from bone-tempered
vessels (all utility ware); and 14.9 percent are from grog-bone-tempered vessels.

The decorated sherds from the Sour Mash site (41HI34) are dominated by sherds from utility ware
vessels (Table 17), as they comprise about 87 percent of the decorated sherd sample (see Table 16).
The principal decorative elements in the utility wares are cross-hatched and diagonal incised lines from
Dunkin Incised vessels, an Early Caddo period ceramic type; sherds with incised decorative elements
comprise 41.3 percent of the decorated sherds from the site. One body sherd is from a contemporaneous
Crockett Curvilinear Incised vessel (Figure 35b). Also in the assemblage are two Weches Fingernail
Impressed, var. Weches body sherds (Figure 35a); these vessels were also made during the Early Caddo
period by Caddo potters.

66ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas

Figure 35. Selected decorative elements on utility ware and fine ware
sherds from the Sour Mash site (41HI34).
Brushed and brushed-incised sherds are relatively common in the ceramic assemblage, accounting for
17.4 percent of the decorated sherds (see Table 17). The occurrence of brushed pottery at the site suggests
that there was also a post-A.D. 1200 occupation there, because ancestral Caddo potters in East Texas
generally began to make vessels with brushed and brushed-incised marks and lines after ca. A.D. 1200,
becoming even more common in ceramic assemblages in the region after ca. A.D. 1400.
The fine ware sherds from the Sour Mash site include sherds with engraved (n=4), engravedpunctated (n=1, see Figure 35c), and engraved-red-slipped (n=1) decorative methods. Two of the
sherdsâwith vertical and vertical-diagonal engraved linesâare likely from Early Caddo period Holly
Fine Engraved vessels.

Collins (41HI50)
Archaeological work at the Collins site at Lake Whitney recovered an incised Caddo sherd of
uncertain type that is in the TARL collections and was analyzed by INAA (see Creel et al. 2013).

Pictograph Shelter (41HI53)
Archaeological investigations at this shelter in the Brazos River valley at Lake Whitney by
Stephenson (1970:Plate 18 and Table 5) recovered 15 sherds from six different ancestral Caddo vessels.
These include eight sherds from a long-necked bottle with an exterior red slip; three plain sherds from
a grog-tempered bowl; one sherd from a grog-tempered vessel with a slipped exterior surface; a single
grog-tempered sherd with opposed engraved lines; one plain grog-tempered sherd; and a single large
sherd with an indeterminate temper (Stephenson 1970:129-130). The sherds were found in Stratum IIb,
IIIa, and IIIb, and may be from use of the shelter both before and after ca. A.D. 1200 given the frequency
of both Perdiz, Scallorn, and Alba arrow points in these strata.

Buzzard Shelter or Cave (41HI54)
According to Stephenson (1970:Table 8), 39 ceramic sherds were recovered in Strata I, II, and III
in the River Basin Survey excavations of Buzzard Cave in the Brazos River valley at Lake Whitney.
These sherds are from two Holly Fine Engraved vessels and a punctated jar (Stephenson 1970:Plate
23), and other sherds have fingernail punctations or âangular engraved lines.â According to Stephenson

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ67
(1970:171), the sherds from Buzzard Shelter âare all of pottery vessels of the Caddoan [sic] area of east
Texas, and those that are identifiable are of types associated with the Alto Focus [now phase]â¦â They
suggest use of the shelter between ca. A.D. 900-1200.
Sherds from at least eight different vessels were recovered in post-River Basin Survey excavations
at Buzzard Cave in the Lake Whitney project area on the Brazos River (Long 1961:226-228 and Figure
2). Two bone-tempered Leon Plain vessels were represented by 31 sherds, and there were seven sherds
from three likely Holly Fine Engraved vessels. Another vessel (n=4 sherds) had a sandy paste and may be
from a Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified jar. Finally, there were two sherds at Buzzard Cave from two
different Dunkin Incised or Weches Fingernail Impressed vessels. Taken together, the ancestral Caddo
ceramics at Buzzard Cave are from vessels likely manufactured between ca. A.D. 900-1200 in an East
Texas production locale.

Sheep Shelter (41HI55)
The Sheep Shelter is in bluffs above a tributary of the Nolans River, about 3 miles south of the Blum
Rockshelter (Stephenson 1970:187). The River Basin Survey work at the site recovered 39 ceramic
vessel sherds from seven different vessels. They are from two Maydelle Incised jars, a plain grog-bonetempered bottle sherd, one grog-tempered body sherd with brushing marks, likely Bullard Brushed, a
bone-tempered sherd with âfinely incised, cross-hatched decoration on the exterior,â and nine sherds
from a plain carinated bowl (Stephenson 1970:199-201 and Plate 33). The last vessel is represented by 19
sherds from a red-slipped bottle that Stephenson (1970:199) classified as Maxey Noded Redware, even
though the sherds have no appliqued nodes, but instead are decorated with a band of engraved crosshatched lines below the neck. I am more inclined to consider these sherds as likely being from a Late
Caddo period, Frankston phase Hume Engraved bottle. Such an identification would be consistent with
the Maydelle Incised and Bullard Brushed sherds present in the assemblage.

McDonald (41HI105)
The TARL collections from the McDonald site at Aquilla Lake includes 62 ceramic sherds from
several vessels and another 70 sherds from the incised Vessel 1 section in Area B (Brown et al. 1987).
Brown et al. (1987:38-104) indicate that 127 ceramic vessel sherds had been recovered at the site in both
Southern Methodist University and University of Texas investigations, primarily from Area B. Brown et
al. (1987:38-105) estimate that the sherds represent between six and 15 different vessels.
INAA has been performed on four sherds (UT00019-22, see Creel et al. 2013); two others had both
INAA and petrographic investigations (Perttula et al. 2003:11-13). Not including the Vessel 1 section,
more than 80 percent of the ceramic vessel sherds from the site are from vessels tempered solely with
grog or fired clay (Table 18). Another 16.1 percent of the sherds are from vessels tempered with both
grog and bone, and 3.2 percent are from vessels tempered solely with crushed and burned bone.

**V. 1 section includes 70 mostly conjoined sherds

Two of the utility ware sherds from the McDonald site are from jars that have parallel brushed marks
or parallel brushed-incised marks and lines. These are from Bullard Brushed vessels manufactured after
ca. A.D. 1200. The four incised sherds, all from grog-tempered vessels, have the following decorative
elements: diagonal opposed lines (n=1), parallel incised lines (n=1), and two lower rim sherds with between
at least 2-5 horizontal incised lines. These sherds are likely either from Davis Incised or Kiam Incised
vessels, and possibly a Dunkin Incised vessel, from an earlier component; such vessels were typically
manufactured by East Texas Caddo peoples between ca. A.D. 900-1200. Brown et al. (1987) report two
uncorrected radiocarbon dates of A.D. 940 + 70 and A.D. 1170 + 70 from the area of the site with the Early
Caddo style ceramics.
The Vessel 1 section is a large grog-bone-tempered jar fired in a reducing environment and cooled in
the open air. There are fire clouds on the exterior rim, body, and base; the interior surface is smoothed,
and the vessel body is burnished. It stood at least 36.0 cm in height, with a direct rim, and with a 27.0 cm
orifice diameter; it would have held at least 12 liters of food stuffs. The vessel rim is 7.9 mm in thickness,
the body walls are 6.7 mm thick, and the base is 10.7 mm thick. The base diameter is 8.3 cm. The rim panel
is decorated with diagonal opposed incised lines (see Brown et al. 1987:Figure 38.16), and given many of
the other sherds in the assemblage, Brown et al. (1987) reasonably identified the vessel as belonging to the
Canton Incised type. Nevertheless, identical diagonal opposed incised elements occur regularly on postA.D. 1400 Maydelle Incised jars made by East Texas Caddo potters (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 52b).
Two incised-punctated jar rim sherds are from a Kiam Incised vessel (see Brown et al. 1987:Figure
38.17a). They have 10 closely-spaced horizontal incised lines and a single row of tool punctations at the
rim-body juncture. The 19 grog-tempered punctated sherds are likely from the same vessel; they have rows
of fingernail punctations, and may be from the body of a Kiam Incised jar.
The fine ware sherds include two grog-tempered body sherds with curvilinear engraved lines (see
Brown et al. 1987:Figure 38.17f-g), one of these from a bottle, and the third engraved sherd (from a
carinated bowl) has diagonal engraved lines. None of these sherds can be identified as a specific defined
East Texas defined ceramic type.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ69
It is possible that the recovered ceramic vessel sherds at the McDonald site are associated with at least
two occupations that had ancestral Caddo vessel sherds, one dating prior to A.D. 1200 (i.e., with Davis Incised
and Kiam Incised vessel sherds) and the other after ca. A.D. 1200 (i.e., with Canton of Maydelle Incised and
brushed, brushed-incised vessel sherds). The available corrected radiocarbon dates from ceramic bearing
deposits at the site range from A.D. 890-1185 to A.D. 1190-1315 (Brown et al. 1987:Table 38.4).
Brown et al. (1987:38-109) have suggested that the McDonald site ceramics were not made in the
Caddo area, primarily because the colors of the clay bodies are ânot typical of those from the central
Caddoan [sic] region, which tends more towards the red and browns.â The color of the ceramic vessels
after firing, however, are not an adequate means to identify local vs. non-local ceramics; differences
in how vessels were fired, then subsequently cooled, as well as differences in the composition of clay
sources, can cause considerable variation in ceramic body colors. Dark brown and black colors of
ceramic bodies, as with the McDonald site ceramics, can be expected whenever a vessel was fired in a
reducing or low oxygen environment, regardless of the clay source.

41HI109
This prehistoric site is on an upland landform overlooking Hackberry Creek, a tributary to Aquilla
Creek in the Aquilla Creek project area (Brown et al. 1987:23-1). A single ceramic sherd had been
collected from the surface of the site during the 1972 survey of the proposed lake. The sherd has a sandy
paste and is bone-tempered; it also has brushing marks on the exterior and interior surfaces (Brown et
al. 1987:23-27). If this sherd is truly from a vessel that has been brushed on both vessel surfaces, there
would be little likelihood that it was from an ancestral Caddo vessel; interior surfaces are usually simply
smoothed, and not decorated. However, if the interior âbrushingâ is a surface treatment such as wiping,
and not a decorative elementâas would be the case for post-A.D. 1200 exterior brushed ceramicsâthen
the 41HI109 sherd may well be from an ancestral East Texas Caddo vessel.

41HI111
Five plain body sherds with exterior smoothed surfaces were recovered from investigations at
41HI111 at Aquilla Lake. Three are described as having clay grit inclusions, which I interpret as meaning
the sherds have grog particles and a sandy paste, plus bone temper (Brown et al. 1987:25-15 to 25-16),
and another has a sandy paste with infrequent inclusions bone inclusions. The possible grog-tempered
sherds at the site may be from an ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel. Brown et al. (1987:25-19) suggest
that the component that has the ceramic sherds, and a few arrow points, may date to the âearlier Late
Prehistoric,â probably predating ca. A.D. 1000.

41HI134
A single grog-tempered Bullard Brushed rim sherd (INAA, UT0005) in the TARL collections has
been recovered from this site on Hackberry Creek at Aquilla Lake in the central Brazos River basin (see
Skinner 1972:Figure 5b). The site is on an upland slope landform overlooking the creek. The brushing
marks on the rim sherd are both diagonal and vertical in orientation on the jar rim. Brown et al. (1987:4853) suggest that other ceramics at the site are from a Toyah phase occupation; the brushed Caddo sherd
would be temporally consistent with a post-A.D. 1200 occupation.

70ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Indian Springs (41HI210)
A single Caddo vessel sherd was recovered from the Indian Springs site in the Brazos River basin.
It has been described as having a fine paste, vessel walls that have been smoothed and/or burnished, and
possibly having a slipped surface (Skinner and Gallagher 1974:66). If the vessel was tempered during
manufacture, Skinner and Gallagher (1974) did not mention it.

41HI237
Skinner (1972:Figure 5a) illustrates a parallel brushed body sherd from this site at Aquilla Reservoir;
the report, unfortunately, provides no further information or description of this ancestral Caddo sherd.
The site has a midden deposit along the edge of the Aquilla Creek floodplain.

41HI239
This site has three grog-tempered Caddo vessel sherds, all body sherds. Two of the sherds had been
analyzed for INAA (UT00001 and UT00002). One of the body sherds has parallel brushing marks,
suggesting the siteâs use after ca. A.D. 1200, when this kind of ceramic vessel was first being made in
quantity by East Texas Caddo potters (see Perttula 2013).

41HI241
There are five Caddo vessel sherds in the collections from 41HI241 at TARL, including one plain
grog-bone-tempered body sherd that was submitted for INAA (UT00003, see Creel et al. 2013). Three
sherds are from grog-tempered vessels and two are from grog-bone-tempered vessels.
One of the grog-tempered sherds has an interior red-slipped surface, as well as an interior thickened
area at the lower rim of the vessel, likely a bowl or carinated bowl. The other decorated sherd, from a
jar, has parallel brushing marks on its exterior surface. The occurrence of a brushed sherd at the site also
suggests its use after ca. A.D. 1200, as does the red-slipped sherd, when both kinds of ceramic vessels
were being made by East Texas Caddo potters.

Little Buzzard Shelter or Cave
The initial investigations of Little Buzzard Shelter in 1947 by Stephenson (1970:269-270) did not
recover any ceramic vessel sherds. However, in later work, there were sherds from six different vessels
in the archaeological deposits at Little Buzzard Shelter or Cave (Long 1961:228 and Figure 5h-j). Three
(represented by four sherds) have engraved decorative elements, and may be from Holly Fine Engraved
and Sanders Engraved vessels (although from the illustrated sherds, it is difficult to discern clear decorative
elements of either type). Two other vessels (with four sherds) may be of the Goose Creek Plain, var.
unspecified type, and Vessel VI includes only one thin (3-4 mm thick) body sherd with âgrit and bone
temper.â The ancestral Caddo sherds from Little Buzzard Shelter or Cave may be contemporaneous with
those present at Buzzard Cave, although the possible Sanders Engraved vessel may suggest some use of
Little Buzzard Shelter or Cave after ca. A.D. 1200.

40A5-11/15
This site is in the Navasota River basin in the western part of Hill County. Frank Watt collected 41 rim
and body sherds here from grog- and grog-bone-tempered vessels (Table 19). Sherds from vessels tempered

only with grog represent approximately 93 percent of the sherds, and the remaining 7.3 percent of the
sherds have some amount of burned bone added to the paste.

Almost 90 percent of the decorated sherds (n=18) are from utility wares, and these include sherds from
vessels with incised, incised-punctated, and punctated decorative elements. The incised sherds include a rim
sherd with horizontal incised lines (probably from a Davis Incised vessel), a body sherd with horizontal and
diagonal incised lines (Figure 36d), and body sherds with parallel incised lines (n=2). One of the incisedpunctated body sherds, likely from a Pennington Punctated-Incised vessel, has an incised panel filled with
tool punctations, and the other (from a Dunkin Incised vessel) has a row of tool punctations at the rim-body
juncture and vertical incised lines on the rim itself. The punctated body sherds have both rows of fingernail
punctates (n=8) (Figure 36c) and rows of tool punctations (Figure 36b). Both fine ware sherds have
engraved decorative elements, including parallel engraved lines or curvilinear engraved lines (Figure 36a).

72ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
The range of decorative elements in this assemblage, as well as the absent of sherds with brushing
marks, suggests that the sherds from this Hill County site date to some part of the Early Caddo period.
They likely originated in the Neches River basin.

Frank Bryan Collection, Hill and McLennan County Sites
Frank Bryan was an active collector of Native American artifacts in Hill and McLennan counties in
the 1920s and 1930s (Bryan 1935, 1936, 1937). In Bryan (1937:72 and Map 4), he mentioned two sites
(No. 2 and No. 4) along Aquilla Creek in Hill County had ceramic vessel sherds, and noted âthe pottery
is of a much lighter color than that found along the Navasota and Richland creek [in Limestone and
Navarro counties]. However the markings are similar. In these two camps the pottery is in limited areas.â
He also mentioned the site near the Cement Plant in McLennan Countyâalso known as the Cement Hill
site (41ML43)âas having two pottery sherds found during his investigations, both engraved (see Bryan
1936:Plate XV:M-M).
His collection was donated to The University of Texas at Austin at some unknown point, and there
are significant quantities of ancestral Caddo ceramics from 15 different sites in the collections at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. The sherds are designated with a three-digit number; the
specific provenience of these sherds in the counties is not known. Thirteen of the sites have only between
1-4 sherds per site, but Site 377 has 197 plain, utility, and fine ware sherds, while Site 390 has 173 sherds
from all three wares.
The one fine ware sherd from Site 140 is a body sherd with parallel engraved lines (Table 20). The
age of this ancestral Caddo sherd is unknown except that is postdates ca. A.D. 800/850, when ancestral
Caddo ceramic vessels began to be made in East Texas.

The one body sherd from Site 373 has two horizontal and diagonal rows of fingernail punctations
(Table 22), probably from a Weches Fingernail Impressed, var. Alto vessel (Stokes and Woodring
1981:Figure 22m). Such vessels were made in Formative and Early Caddo period times in East Texas.

The 197 vessel sherds from Site 377 include plain wares (72.1 percent), utility wares (24.9 percent),
and fine wares (3.0 percent). These vessels have primarily been tempered with grog (94.9 percent), either
as the sole temper, or in conjunction with bone (20.0 percent of the sherds) or hematite (0.5 percent)
(Table 24). Another 3.6 percent have either bone or bone-hematite temper, and 1.5 percent of the sherds
are from Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified vessels (Story 1990a). The latter are from a Woodland
period use of the site, while the remainder of the sherds are from ancestral Caddo vessels. The decorated
sherds (n=55) are discussed below, together with the decorated sherd assemblage from Site 390.

Both sherds from Site 383 are probably from the same grog-tempered vessel, a fine vessel with
engraved decorative elements and a red slip on both interior and exterior vessel surfaces (Table 25).
This vessel has a broad horizontal engraved band filled with cross-hatched engraved lines as well as
a narrower horizontal engraved band with vertical hatched engraved lines (Figure 38). Horizontal and
vertical bands and ladder elements are most frequent in Middle Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1200-1400)
ceramic assemblages in East Texas (Perttula 2013:192).

The ceramic vessel sherds from Site 390 include sherds from plain ware (70.5 percent), utility ware
(23.1 percent), and fine ware (6.4 percent) vessels (Table 31); these proportions are very little different
from Site 377 (see Table 24). Almost 94 percent of the vessel sherds from the site are tempered with
grog, grog-bone, or grog-hematite. About 4.6 percent of the sherds are tempered solely with burned bone.
The remainder of the vessel sherd assemblage from the site are three body sherds (1.7 percent) from
Woodland period Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified vessels (see Story 1990a).

The two grog-tempered fine ware sherds from Site 391 (Table 32) have a narrow and engraved circle
element filled with hatched lines (Figure 40a-b). A red pigment has been rubbed in the engraved lines on
one of the sherds. These sherds may be related to several regional varieties of Poynor Engraved defined
in the upper Neches River basin in East Texas (Perttula 2011:Figure 6-65).

Figure 42. Decorative elements on sherds from Site 393 in the Bryan

One of the fine ware body sherds from Site 393 is from a Poynor Engraved, var. Cook vessel with
an oval decorative element defined by vertical arcing lines (see Figure 42b, see Perttula 2011:Figure
6-64); there are two horizontal engraved lines immediately above the engraved oval. Poynor Engraved,
var. Cook vessels occur in ca. A.D. 1400-1650 burial features in the upper Neches River basin, and are
most common in ca. A.D. 1480-1560 components (Perttula 2011:Table 6-37). The second engraved sherd
from the site may be from a Hume Engraved vessel (see Figure 42c). It has a horizontal row of excised
pendant triangles above a narrow horizontal zone filled with cross-hatched engraved line, followed by
a single horizontal engraved line. In the upper Neches River basin, Hume Engraved vessels began to be
made after ca. A.D. 1480, in the Late Caddo Frankston phase, and become more common from the time
of the Frankston phase to the post-A.D. 1680 Allen phase (Perttula 2011:283 and Table 6-37).
In the case of the larger assemblages of decorated sherds from Site 377 and Site 390, utility ware
sherds are by far the most common at both sites: 89 percent of the decorated sherds at Site 377 and 78.4
percent at Site 390 (Tables 35 and 36). Sherds from utility ware vessels with either incised or punctated
decorative elements dominate both the Site 377 and Site 390 assemblages. A few sherds at both sites have
incised-punctated decorative elements (5.9-7.3 percent), there is one incised-pinched sherd from Site 390,
and an appliqued lug handle at Site 390. Sherds with brushing marks, or with brushed-incised marks and

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ79
lines are present at both sites, indicating some use of the sites after ca. A.D. 1200, when brushed utility
wares became a common feature of ancestral Caddo ceramics in several parts of East Texas, including
the Neches-Angelina, Sabine, and Big Cypress stream basins (Perttula 2013). Brushed or brushed-incised
sherds comprise 5.4 percent of the decorated sherds at Site 377 and 13.7 percent of the decorated sherds
at Site 390.

Based on the stylistic character of the utility ware and fine ware sherds at the two sites, the principal
occupation of Site 377 and Site 390 was from ca. A.D. 900-1200, during the Early Caddo period in
East Texas. Both sites also have ancestral Caddo pottery that was made during the Late Caddo period
Frankston phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1680), and there is evidence of Historic Caddo period Allen phase
ceramics dating between ca. A.D. 1680-1720 at Site 390, including one sherd each from Patton Engraved
(Figure 44f) and Spradley Brushed-Incised vessels (see Table 36).
The Early Caddo period ceramics at both sites includes sherds from Crockett Curvilinear Incised
(Figure 43a, e), Dunkin Incised (Figures 43b-d and 44a-c), Kiam Incised, Pennington Punctated-Incised
(Figure 43g), and Weches Fingernail Impressed (Figure 43f; most of the fingernail punctated sherds
at both sites are likely from this type), var. Alto and var. Weches vessels (see Stokes and Woodring
1981), and sherds from these vessels are the most abundantly represented in the decorated utility ware
sherds. No fine wares in the assemblage can be clearly identified as coming from an Early Caddo period
engraved vessel, except perhaps for one sherd from Site 390 with horizontal-vertical-diagonal engraved
lines and another sherd with a single horizontal engraved line on its interior vessel surface (see Table 35).
The Late Caddo period Frankston phase ceramics at both sites include utility wares, among them
brushed and brushed-incised sherds from Bullard Brushed vessels (see Tables 34 and 35), and a sherd
from a Killough Pinched jar. Fine wares from Poynor Engraved (see Figure 44d) and/or Hume Engraved
vessels (see Figures 43h-i and 44e) are represented in the sherds from the two sites. The occurrence
of Hume Engraved suggests that the sherds came from vessels made in East Texas after ca. A.D. 1480
(Perttula 2011:268).

In addition to Toyah phase Leon Plain sherds, there are grog and bone-tempered Caddo ceramic
sherds in the assemblage of 66 sherds collected by Creel (1990:143). There are two plain grog-tempered
rim or body sherds and eight decorated sherds. One rim sherd from a LaRue Neck Banded jar has two
or more neck banded rows, four sherds (including INAA UT00198 and UT00201) from Bullard Brushed
vessels have parallel brushing marks, two others have parallel brushed-incised marks and lines, and a
Bullard Brushed rim has horizontal brushing marks with a row of fingernail punctations pushed through
the brushing at the mid-rim.

84ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Sugg TD Ranch (41IR50)
The TARL collection from the Sugg TD Ranch has six brushed body sherds with bone temper
(including INAA UT00262). Brushed bone-tempered Caddo pottery dating after ca. A.D. 1400 is quite
common in the Angelina and mid-Sabine River basins in East Texas (see Perttula 2015a:Figure 11), and
these sherds likely are from one or more vessels manufactured by ancestral Caddo potters in that part of
East Texas.

Kendall County
41KE66
This site on the Guadalupe River has an ancestral Caddo Poynor Engraved sherd (Neureuther 1984).
This is indicative of the use of this rock art site after ca. A.D. 1400.

Unrecorded site north of Comfort, Texas
Chandler (1995:27-28) reports on a partially reconstructed everted rim jar with four or five parallel
rows of punctations on the rim; the jar has a rounded rather than a flat base. The vessel appears to be
associated with the use of Edwards arrow points, dating to the 10th and 11th centuries A.D.

Kerr County
Unrecorded site near Hunt, Texas
A T-shaped ceramic tubular pipe has been found on a midden site near Hunt, Texas, in Kerr County
(Chandler 1995:Figure 1). Chandler (1995:27) notes that such a pipe style âis well documented in
northeast Texas and eastern Oklahomaâ¦There is growing evidence for the movement of Caddoan [sic]
ceramics well into south central Texas.â

Lampasas County
Salt Creek
A surface collection at a site at the confluence of Salty Creek and the Colorado River in western
Lampasas County has ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds (Field 1956:168 and Plate 21d-e), although
the actual number of sherds was not stated. These sherds are from post-A.D. 1400 Frankston phase
vessels of the types Bullard Brushed, Killough Pinched, and Poynor Engraved. The Poynor Engraved rim
sherd has a loop handle (Field 1956:Plate 21e), an unusual feature in Poynor Engraved vessels.

Llano County
Fall Creek (41LL4)
Jackson (1938:110-111) identified 64 ceramic sherds from the Fall Creek site, being found in two
burned rock mounds and two middens; most of the sherds were recovered from midden no. 2 (n=37).
Jackson (1938:111) considered 15 of the sherds to have originated in East Texas, and these have brushed,
appliqued, and engraved decorative elements (Jackson 1938:Plate XXII), including one Historic Caddo
Patton Engraved sherd (Jackson 1938:Plate XXII:3).

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ85
In addition to Toyah phase Leon Plain sherds, Midden 1 at the Fall Creek site (Site No. 3) also
contains three ancestral Caddo vessel sherds. The first is a bone-tempered body sherd with parallel
brushing marks, likely from a Bullard Brushed vessel made by a Caddo potter in the Neches, Angelina,
or mid-Sabine River basins in East Texas (see Perttula 2015a:Figure 11). A grog-tempered body sherd has
parallel incised lines (INAA, UT00290), and a grog-bone-tempered body sherd has a straight appliqued
ridge (INAA, UT00289).

41LL76
Ceramic vessel sherds from 41LL76 include sherds from
Maydelle Incised (INAA, UT00348, grog-bone-tempered)
(Figure 45) and Bullard Brushed types, and sherds from a linear
punctated jar (Assad and Potter 1979:Figure 14a-b, f-g). Other
sherds in the collections at TARL include a grog-bone-tempered
body sherd with closely-spaced parallel engraved lines (INAA,
UT00351), a grog-tempered body sherd with vertical brushing
marks (INAA, UT00350), and a grog-bone-tempered body
sherd with a row of tool punctations (INAA, UT00349). These
kinds of decorations on ancestral Caddo pottery likely are
associated with post-A.D. 1400 vessels manufacture by upper
Neches River basin groups.

41LL76.

41LL413 (Charlotte Graham Collection)
A grog-tempered body sherd (INAA, UT00181) with parallel brushing marks and rows of fingernail
punctations pushed through the brushing is one of the two ancestral Caddo sherds from 41LL413. This
sherd is likely from a Bullard Brushed jar. The second ancestral Caddo sherd from the site has incised
chevron elements (Maydelle Incised) (Chuck Hixson, July 2017 personal communication). 41LL413 is
on a high terrace of the Llano River.

41LL415
A Maydelle Incised jar rim sherd with hatched
incised lines and a fingernail punctated strap handle
has been recovered at this site on a small tributary to
the Colorado River (Figure 46). The site has apparently
been heavily damaged by golf course construction and
the impounding of Lake LBJ (Charles Hixson, July 2017
personal communication).

Mason County
Honey Creek (41MS32)
The Honey Creek site is on a southward-flowing
tributary to the Llano River (Black et al. 1997). The
Toyah component there has a few sherds (n=4) from an
ancestral Caddo vessel; they were recovered from a nonmidden area at the southern end of the site (Black et al.

1997:Figure 32; Ellis 1997:Table 87). The sherds have bone and grog temper, with hematite pieces also in
the paste, and are described as having âa brushed/incised designâ¦on the exterior surface of two sherdsâ
(Ellis 1997:560). Ellis (1997:560) considers these sherds to be âpart of a Caddo tradeware vessel,â one
that would have been made by a Caddo potter in East Texas sometime after ca. A.D. 1200, when brushed
utility wares were commonly produced in several different East Texas locales.

McLennan County
Gas Plant (41ML28)
Ancestral Caddo ceramic sherds in the TARL collections from the Gas Plant site on the Brazos River
are from grog-tempered plain (n=8, including INAA, UT00028) and decorated (n=1) sherds. The one
decorated sherd has cross-hatched incised decorative elements, and is likely from a Maydelle Incised
vessel. Jensen (1967:45-49) indicates that the Gas Plant site was likely occupied by the Tawakoni or
Waco peoples between the 1770s and 1830s.

Baylor Site (41ML35)
Excavations by Story and Shafer (1965) recovered 37 ceramic vessel sherds from the Baylor site at Waco
Reservoir on the Brazos River. These included grog-tempered sherds from an Early Caddo period Weches
Fingernail Impressed vessel (Story and Shafer 1965:Figure 23a-d), an incised-pinched bone-tempered vessel
(Story and Shafer 1965:Figure 24a), sherds from an incised-punctated vessel (Story and Shafer 1965:Figure
24b-d), and sherds from a plain bottle (Story and Shafer 1965:Figure 24c-h). There also were seven plain
sherds, one with grog temper and the other six with bone temper (Story and Shafer 1965:Figure 24i-k).
TARL sherds from the Baylor site analyzed by INAA include three samples from ancestral Caddo
vessels: a plain grog-tempered body sherd (previously identified as incised-punctated, UT00031), an
Early Caddo period Weches Fingernail Impressed grog-tempered body sherd (UT00029), and a grogtempered plain bottle sherd (UT00030). The bottle sherd has an exterior burnished surface.
Mehalchick and Kibler (2008:65-69 and Figure 5.11) also recovered a small number of grog and
bone-tempered Caddo sherds from the Baylor site in later investigations, including grog-tempered
(n=11), bone-tempered (n=1), grit-tempered (n=1), grog-grit-tempered (n=1), and grog-bone-tempered
(n=1). The bone-tempered sherds have parallel incised lines, while others have pinching, fingernail
punctations, and tool punctations. One sherd from a Weches Fingernail Impressed vessel indicates that
these Caddo sherds were made in Early Caddo period times, from ca. A.D. 900-1200. Mehalchick and
Kibler (2008:68-69) concluded that:
these sherdsâ¦must have come from East Texas. Conclusive evidence of this comes from a
geochemical study of Caddo-style decorated ceramic sherds from other central Texas sites
(Perttula et al. 2003). This study demonstrates that these sherds were not made from central
Texas clays, thereby ruling out the possibility that Caddo potters moved to central Texas or
that the Caddo transferred pottery styles to central Texas potters.

Stone Site (41ML38)
The Stone site is a late 18th century (ca. A.D. 1770-1786) Tawakoni Wichita village on an alluvial
terrace of the west side of the Brazos River across from the mouth of Aquilla Creek (Duffield and Jelks
1961:70-73; Jelks 1970; Smith 2000; Cook and Dunbar 2008; Turner-Pearson 2008). The Tawakoni

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ87
headman was Chief Quiscat (Smith 2000:54). Remote sensing investigations indicate that the village
had at least 75 circular structures arranged in rows and remnants of earthwork fortifications (Cook and
Dunbar 2008:497 and Figure 7).
Frank Watt and Al Redder collected from the surface of the Stone site primarily from 1959-1962,
after Edward B. Jelks had found the site in 1959 (Jelks 2017:1-2), but continued collecting there through
the 1970s (Turner-Pearson 2008:566). The collected artifacts are now in the holdings of the Mayborn
Museum Complex at Baylor University. Jelks (2017 personal communication) indicated that when he
recorded the site, Frank Watt was unaware of it since he had been looking for sites on the east side of the
Brazos River.
The ceramic sherds collected by Watt and Redder have been documented for this report. There
are other ceramic sherd collections found by Walton Ballew at the site, as well as 556 ceramic sherds
recovered in the 1999-2002 Baylor University Field Schools held at the site (Turner-Pearson 2008:Table
1). These sherds have not been studied, but Turner-Pearson (2008:573 and Figure 16) illustrates both
Patton Engraved and Womack Engraved sherds in the Ballew Collection. Turner-Pearson (2008:573) also
indicates that she identified sherds from bone-tempered Goliad Plain vessels in the collections, and there
are a few such sherds (with handles) in the Watt-Redder collection.
There are 656 ceramic sherds in the Watt and Redder collections from the Stone site, including 94
sherds with decorative elements (Table 37). The plain to decorated sherd ratio (P/DR) of the assemblage is
5.97, indicating that plain vessels, or vessels with large undecorated portions, are quite common in this late
18th century Wichita ceramic assemblage. This is particularly the case with the grog-bone-tempered and
bone-tempered wares, as the P/DR for these wares ranges between 7.59-8.00, compared to P/DR values for
the grog-tempered and shell-tempered wares that range from only 2.00-2.60.

88ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
The sherds are from vessels tempered with a variety of inclusions, principally burned bone and
grog. More than 84 percent of the sherds from the Stone site have burned bone aplastics, either as the
sole temper (46.1 percent), or in combination with grog (38.1 percent); one sherd has burned bone and
crushed hematite temper (0.2 percent). Vessels tempered solely with grog represent 14.8 percent of the
assemblage, and 52.9 percent of all the sherds in the assemblage have grog temper as either the sole
temper or in combination with bone (see Table 37). Sherds from shell-tempered vessels account for only
0.9 percent of the Stone site ceramics.
Ceramic vessels at earlier Wichita sites in the Arkansas River (Lasley Vore, see Odell 2002) and
the Red River (Longest, see Bell et al. 1967; Beach 2015) were regularly temperedâif not almost
exclusively at the Lasley Vore site and the Bryson-Paddock site (Hartley and Miller 1977)âwith burned
mussel shell, but by 1750, a range of tempers were employed in vessel manufacture, including grog,
bone, and shell. In Texas Wichita sites in the Brazos (Stone site) and Trinity (Vinson site) river basins
that date between ca. 1760-1790, the ceramics found on them are primarily bone-tempered (Table 38),
with a considerable decrease in the use of burned mussel shell as a temper. Grog-tempered ceramics are
especially well represented at the Stone site, and these grog-tempered and grog-bone-tempered sherds
are from East Texas Caddo ceramic vessels. The decorations on the bone-tempered and shell-tempered
sherds in the assemblage (see Table 37) suggest that they also come from East Texas Caddo vessels. By
ca. 1750, Wichita Indian peoples were relying on Caddo manufactured vessels obtained through French
trade networks as well as copper kettles (see Beach 2015).

1993:110 and Table 3). Beach (2015:85) indicates that 101 sherds at Longest only had sand as a temper.

Each of the tempered wares at the Stone site have a different assortment of decorative methods and
elements (Figures 47 and 48). The grog-tempered sherds are primarily from brushed jars (59.3 percent),
and these were probably made by East Texas Caddo potters (Table 39). The only other utility ware is a
rim sherd with diagonal incised lines, similar to Incised Sherd Group 1 at the Gilbert site (41RA13) in
the upper Sabine River basin (Story et al. 1967:134), occupied between ca. A.D. 1720-1780 by Caddo
peoples. Engraved wares from Womack Engraved vessels account for another 26 percent of the grog-

tempered vessel sherds, and there is also one horizontal engraved body sherd from a red-slipped vessel.
The Womack Engraved sherds are from Design A (Harris et al. 1965:Figure 6a; Story et al. 1967:Figure
49a) vessels, and the one sherd with a straight engraved line with tick marks is from a Patton Engraved
vessel. About 7 percent of the decorated sherds are from vessels that have a red slip on their exterior
surfaces; similar red-slipped sherds of uncertain type are present in the assemblage at the Longest site
(Beach 2015:81), but not at the nearer Vinson site (see Smith et al. 1993).

The decorated grog-bone-tempered vessel sherds from the Stone site have a high proportion of
engraved wares (58.6 percent). These include a number from Womack Engraved Design A and B vessel
sherds (see Figure 47; see also Story et al. 1967:Figure 49b). Interior and/or exterior red-slipped vessels
account for another 20.7 percent of the grog-bone-tempered decorated sherds (see Table 39). The
remainder of the decorated sherds (20.7 percent) in this group are from jars with brushed and brushedincised marks and lines.
The bone-tempered wares from the Stone site are dominated by engraved fine wares (52.8 percent)
and red-slipped sherds (27.8 percent) (see Table 39). These are primarily from Womack Engraved,
Design A and B vessels (see Figure 47), but one sherd with parallel engraved lines and tick marks is
likely from a Patton Engraved vessel. Brushed and brushed-incised vessel sherds account for 13.9 percent
of the bone-tempered decorated sherds at the site. The one appliqued sherd has parallel appliqued ridges,
and may be from a Cass Appliqued jar (see Story et al. 1967:144). The single bone-tempered punctated
body sherd has only a single fingernail punctation.
One of the two shell-tempered sherds with decorative elements in the Stone site collection has a
broad curvilinear engraved line, and may be from a Design C Womack Engraved vessel (see Harris et al.
1965:Figure 6c; Story et al. 1967:Figure 49c). The other decorated shell-tempered sherd has an exterior
red slip, and may be from a Clement Redware vessel (see Flynn 1976), made by Late and Historic Caddo
potters of the McCurtain phase living along the mid-Red River basin in East Texas and southeast Oklahoma,
or later Womack phase peoples with settlements on the Red River and the upper Sabine River basin.
There is also a collection of sherds from the Stone site in the TARL holdings; these apparently were
collected by Frank Watt at Dee Ann Storyâs request and subsequently donated to TARL in the mid-1960s.
In addition to Goliad plain handle sherds (n=7), there are ancestral Caddo sherds from grog, grog-bone,

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ93
and bone-tempered vessels (Table 40) as well as an assortment of ceramic elbow pipe sherds of likely
Caddo manufacture, and one ceramic ear plug.

Sherds with bone temper comprise 52.9 percent of this particular assemblage at the site, along with
another 16.7 percent that are from grog and bone-tempered vessels. Only 30.4 percent of the sherdsâbut
most of the decorated piecesâare from grog-tempered vessels.
Among the utility wares in this collection is a grog-tempered body sherd with parallel brushed
marks and overlying parallel incised lines, most likely from an Historic Caddo Spradley Brushed-Incised
vessel; these vessels were made by Caddo potters in the Neches-Angelina river basins in East Texas (see
Marceaux 2011). Three grog-tempered body sherds and one bone-tempered body sherd from Bullard
Brushed vessels have parallel brushing marks, while grog-tempered body (n=1) and rim sherds (n=1)
have either overlapping or horizontal brushing marks on jars. Another body sherd, but from a bonetempered vessel, has a set of zig-zag incised lines.
The fine ware sherds in the TARL collection from the Stone site have engraved (n=3) and red-slipped
(n=4) decorative elements. One engraved sherd has a single curvilinear engraved line, another has
horizontal and vertical engraved lines, and the third has a straight engraved line with excised tick marks
on both sides of the engraved line; this decorative element may be related to the ticked engraved lines on
Patton Engraved vessels made by Caddo potters living in the Neches-Angelina river basin after ca. A.D.
1680. Two of the red-slipped sherds have a slip on both interior and exterior vessel surfaces, and the two
others have a red slip only on their exterior surface.
Taking the Watt/Redder and TARL collections from the Stone site together as one assemblage
for purposes of comparison with other assemblages with decorated ancestral Caddo pottery, the 109
decorated sherds include utility wares (n=38, 34.9 percent) and fine wares (n=71, 65.1 percent). The
utility wares are from vessels with appliqued (n=1), brushed (n=30), brushed-incised (n=4), incised
(n=2), and punctated (n=1) decorative elements. The fine wares are from vessels that have engraved
(n=47), engraved-red-slipped (n=1), and red-slipped (n=23) vessels.
Sherds from ceramic elbow pipes are relatively common in the TARL collections from the Stone site
(n=10). These pipes are either tempered with grog (n=6) or bone (n=2); two other pipe sherds have been
carved from a tuffaceous stone, and have parallel lines carved into two sides of the pipe stem. These
elbow pipes have flat lips, burnished to polished bodies, and have a distal knob on the stem (see Story
1985:Figure 4a). The most complete elbow pipe in the TARL collection has a flat lip and a polished

orifice diameters are 11.8 mm and 24.2 mm, respectively.
		

94ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
The ceramic ear plug in the TARL collection from the Stone site is grog-tempered, and flattened at
one end. The ear plug is 13.0 mm in diameter, with flat ends, and approximately 14.1 mm in height. Very
similar ear plugs have been documented from late 17th century burial features at the H. R. Taylor site
(41HS3) in the Big Cypress Creek basin in East Texas (Perttula 2018:Figure 426c).
In a broader comparative sense, in the ca. A.D. 1719-1750 Wichita occupation at the Lasley Vore site,
sherds from vessels with incised or punctated decorative elements comprise more than 91 percent of the
decorated sherd sample (see Odell 2002), with no red-slipped sherds and only small amounts of brushed
pottery (Table 40); this pottery (Deer Creek Brushed) is on vessels manufactured with shell temper (Odell
2002:194). At the generally contemporaneous Bryson-Paddock site, however, simple stamped sherds
from shell-tempered vessels comprise about 87 percent of the decorated sherds (Hartley and Miller
1977:62). Brushed (Deer Creek Brushed) and incised (Emory Punctated-Incised) shell-tempered sherds
account for another 2 percent of the decorated sherds. The remaining 11 percent of the decorated sherds
are from Womack Engraved vessels (Hartley and Miller 1977:74-75).
After A.D. 1750, the assemblage at the Longest site is dominated by engraved sherds from Womack
Engraved and Patton Engraved vessels (Bell and Bastian 1967). Both the post-A.D. 1760-1790 and ca.
A.D. 1770-1786 components at the Vinson and Stone sites have considerable proportions of bone and/
or grog-tempered brushed pottery that was made by Caddo peoples (Table 41). Womack Engraved and
Patton Engraved remain the principal fine wares in both components. Most distinctive is the grog, bone,
and shell-tempered sherds from red-slipped vessels only at the Stone site; the other 18th century Wichita
sites do not have red-slipped vessels, although Drass (February 2017 personal communication) has noted
a single red-slipped and simple stamped sherd in the Longest site ceramic assemblage.

Beach (2015:86) has noted that by the 1750s the Wichita living at the Longest site (34JF1) on the
Red River âwere no longer depending solely upon their own vessels to cook and store foods as copper
kettles and Caddo vessels were being widely used instead.â The number of Caddo ceramic vessel sherds
at the Stone site indicates this is also the case later in the 18th century, though, given the number of vessel
sherds in the collection, Caddo vessels were apparently rather regularly obtained by the Wichita living
on the Brazos River through their Caddo and French trade networks. Beach (2015:92) questions the
origin of the Caddo ceramic vessels at the Longest site, but concedes that trade is one possibility; she
suggests also that Caddo women may have been âmarrying into the Wichita village.â Since the Caddo
have a matrilineal social organization where the women remain in their own villages and communities

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ95
and the husbands would move to these villages and communities, for Caddo women to be living in
Wichita villages would be likely only in cases where Caddo families were actually residing in the Wichita
villages. Thus, it seems unlikely that marriage would account for the presence of Caddo ceramic vessels
on mid- to late 18th century Wichita villages.

Clark Site (41ML39)
The Clark site is located on the Brazos River about 1.2 km below its confluence with Aquilla Creek,
a southward-flowing tributary of the river, and ca. 10 km upstream from the city of Waco. The site
consists of a buried midden deposit (ca. 50-95 cm bs) in an alluvial terrace of the Brazos (Watt 1965:99).
The Central Texas Archeological Society completed excavations at the site in 1955, and recovered a
small number of arrow points of the Perdiz type (n=20) and 63 ceramic sherds (Watt 1965:Figures 3a-n
and 5c-h). The three decorated sherds in the collection have either diagonally opposed incised line or
an incised-punctated rim sherd (Watt 1965:Figure 5c-e), and may be from Canton Incised vessels. A
single uncalibrated radiocarbon date of A.D. 1275 + 150 was obtained on charcoal from a hearth (Watt
1978:121); most of the pottery sherds recovered from the site came from excavations near to the hearth.
The Frank Watt sherd collection from the Clark site at the Mayborn Museum Complex has 55
ceramic sherds from ancestral Caddo vessels (Table 42). Most notably, the decorated sherds are from
vessels typically found in Sanders phase (ca. A.D. 1200-1400), McCurtain phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1680),
and Womack phase (post-A.D. 1680) sites along the Red River, rather than from Caddo potters living in
communities along the Neches River in East Texas.

About 91 percent of the ceramic sherd assemblage comes from vessels tempered either solely with
grog or with grog and bone temper (see Table 42). One of the plain rim sherds (Figure 49c) may be
from a Late Caddo period (dating after ca. A.D. 1500-1550) Simms Plain vessel with a very narrow and
inverted rim (cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:139); others have more direct profiles (Figure 49i-j). Only 3.6
percent of the sherds are from bone-tempered vessels, but another 20 percent have both grog and bone
temper inclusions. More than 5 percent of the sherds are from shell-tempered vessels; shell-tempered
ceramic sherds are rather uncommon in Central Texas ceramic assemblages.

96ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas

Figure 49. Selected decorated sherds from the Clark site in the Frank Watt collections.
The decorated sherds in this Clark site assemblage are divided between utility ware (n=5) and
fine ware (n=4). The utility wares include a grog-tempered lip notched rim, a grog-tempered rim with
diagonal opposed incised lines (see Figure 49g), and another grog-tempered rim with diagonal incised
lines. The first shell-tempered rim sherd is from a Nash Neck Banded jar, of Late Caddo age and
McCurtain phase affiliation (see Figure 49e), and the other is a body sherd from an Emory PunctatedIncised jar; this type is commonly present in both post-A.D. 1550 and post-A.D. 1680 mid-Red River
components. The sherd has a tool punctated row at the rim-body juncture and a diagonal appliqued ridge
on the vessel body (see Figure 49h).
Two of the engraved fine ware sherds are from Middle Caddo period Sanders Engraved carinated
bowls with either cross-hatched engraved lines, or an engraved triangle filled with vertical engraved
lines (see Figure 49d); one of these sherds has a red slip on both interior and exterior vessel surfaces
(see Figure 49f). A shell-tempered body sherd is from a Late Caddo period Avery Engraved vessel
with opposed engraved lines; this sherd also has a red slip on both vessel surfaces (see Figure 49a).
The last Caddo fine ware sherd in this Watt collection is a grog-tempered rim from a post-A.D. 1680
manufactured Womack Engraved vessel. Such sherds are common in 18th century Wichita sites in the
Waco area (see discussion of the Stone site ceramics [41ML38]). This rim has a slanting engraved scroll
element and a cross-hatched triangle element under the lip (see Figure 49b).

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ97
There is a small collection of ceramic artifacts from the Frank Watt collection in the holdings of the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin (TARL). This consists of
19 plain or decorated sherds from grog- or bone-tempered vessels (Table 43). Many of the plain sherds
have burnished surfaces.

About 58 percent of the sherds in this small
collection are from bone-tempered vessels, and the
remainder are from grog-tempered vessels. The one
plain rim has a direct or vertical profile and a rounded
lip.
Four of the decorated sherds are from brushed
utility ware vessels, including a rim (direct profile
and a rounded, exterior folded lip) with horizontal
and vertical opposed brushing marks (Figure 50a).

the site. The one incised sherd is from the body of
a vessel and has a set of parallel incised lines. The
incised-punctated rim sherd (direct profile and a rounded lip) is likely from a Maydelle Incised jar. It has
diagonal incised triangle elements filled with rows of circular punctations (Figure 50b).

Cement Hill (41ML43)
The Cement Hill site is on an upland landform marked by the Austin Chalk Escarpment west of the
Brazos River and ca. 1 mile from the South Bosque River (Watt 1953:73). Watt had recovered about 100
ceramic vessel sherds from the site, including several that were engraved (n=2) and had a red slip, or were
simply red-slipped (n=3). Others were undecorated rim sherds (n=5); one rim had a horizontal incised line
below the lip; four had fingernail punctations; and five sherds were from Bullard Brushed vessels (Watt
1953:75 and Figure 22:1-7). Watt also mentioned the recovery of three probable Leon Plain sherds, as these
were not incised, had a reddish color, and had âheavy bone temper inclusionsâ (Watt 1953:75).

98ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
The most intriguing ceramic find reported by Watt
at the Cement Hill site was an almost complete Hood
Engraved bowl, with the accompanying effigy broken
off some time prior to its discovery (Figure 51; see
also Watt 1953:Figure 22B). the vessel was 12.7 cm
in diameter and had horizontal and dipping engraved
lines around the vessel; it was also red-slipped. Hood
Engraved effigy vessels are concentrated in post-A.D.
Caddo sites in several parts of the upper Neches River
basin (Perttula 2011:Figure 6-67), and were most
commonly used as mortuary offerings between ca. A.D.
1400-1480, although they continued to be made in the
Historic Allen phase. The Hood Engraved vessel from
the Cement Hill site is a var. Hood bowl: they have
effigy heads (usually a bird or a duck) and tab tails, as
well as broad horizontal engraved lines (usually three
lines) on the rim (Perttula 2011:271).

Hill site.

Chupik (41ML44)
The Chupik site is located on an alluvial knoll in the Brazos River floodplain, a few km north of the
confluence of the Brazos River and Aquilla Creek (Figure 52). Substantial numbers of ceramic sherds
(n=700) have been collected from the site by Frank Watt (1941a, 1953), and a much larger ceramic sherd
assemblage was recovered from the site during the 1972 University of Texas (UT) Field School (Dillehay
1972; Locke 1975).

floodplain, based on Gholson 7.5â USGS topographic quadrangle.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ99
The Watt collection from the Chupik site included 550 plain body sherds and 150 decorated rim
and body sherds (Watt 1953:73). The decorated sherds are from Pennington Punctated-Incised, Hickory
Engraved, Davis Incised, Dunkin Incised, and Weches Fingernail Impressed, var. Weches vessels, and
there are other sherds with incised or punctated decorative elements (Watt 1953:Figures 21a-b and 22a).
A few of the sherds illustrated by Watt (1953:Figure 22:1, 10, 14, and 22) are stylistically similar to Late
Caddo period, Frankston phase Poynor Engraved and Bullard Brushed types.
During the UT Field School investigations at the Chupik site, nine different aboriginal ceramic
sherd clusters were recognized across the knoll (Figure 53). These clusters cover a ca. 80 x 90 m area
and are arranged in a large circle, with seven of the ceramic sherd clusters on the perimeter of the circle,
an eighth on another knoll just to the east, and the ninth in the center of the circular clusters of ceramic
sherds. Several of the ceramic clusters at the northern and southern ends of the site are associated with
significant amounts of animal bone, and these clusters probably mark trash midden deposits. The smaller
ceramic clusters on the northern, western, and eastern portions of the site may mark structure locations
and/or outside activity areas. It is clear that the Chupik site has a significant residential component. In
fact, Newell and Krieger (1949:195) had suggested that the Chupik site was am Early Caddo period
village of Alto focus [now Alto phase) peoples.

Figure 53. Ceramic artifact clusters at the Chupik site (41ML44).

100ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
The assemblage of sherds from the site are almost exclusively from grog- or bone-tempered vessels
(Table 44); one sherd has a sandy paste and may be from a Woodland period (ca. 500 B.C.-A.D. 800)
Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified vessel (see Story 1990a). About 83 percent of the sherds are from
grog-tempered vessels, and about 17 percent of the sherds are from bone-tempered vessels. The highest
proportion of bone temper use is in the fine wares (26.6 percent) from the Chupik site.

Note: this does not include four decorated sherds that were submitted for INAA and petrographic analysis from the
site (Perttula et al. 2003:13-14 and Figure 3).

About 33 percent of the sherds in the collection have decorative elements, and the plain to decorated
sherd ratio is 2.0. Almost 84 percent of the sherds with decorative elements in the Chupik site ceramic
assemblage are from utility wares (i.e., vessels with wet paste decorations), and sherds from fine ware
vessels (decorated after the vessel was leather-hard or after firing) comprise 16.2 percent of the sample of
decorated sherds. Furthermore, approximately 77 percent of the rim sherds in the assemblage (n=52) are
from utility wares, and 23 percent are from fine wares. Both proportions indicate that sherds from utility
ware vessels overall are by far the most common kind of decorated vessel sherds in the assemblage.
A total of 50 percent of the utility ware sherds are from vessels with punctated decorative elements
(Table 45). Sherds from incised vessels account for 39.8 percent of the utility wares, followed by sherds
with incised-punctated decorative elements (9.3 percent). Sherds from brushed (0.7 percent) and brushedincised (0.2 percent) elements comprise only approximately 1 percent of the decorated sherd assemblage.

The sherds from punctated vessels are overwhelmingly decorated with rows of fingernail punctations
(95 percent), including one bowl that has rows of fingernail punctates on the interior vessel surface (see
Table 45). A few sherds have curvilinear or diagonal opposed rows (Figure 54a), but most have horizontal
rows of fingernail punctations on the rim and/or the vessel body. These are likely from Kiam Incised and
Weches Fingernail Impressed jars. The vessel sherds with either circular punctated or tool punctated rows
comprise 2.4 and 3.9 percent, respectively, of the punctated sherds in the assemblage.

Figure 54. Selected decorative elements on utility ware sherds from the Chupik site
(41ML44): a, body sherd with diagonal opposed fingernail punctated rows; b-g, incised rim
and body sherds.
The sherds from incised vessels at the Chupik site have horizontal, diagonal, and diagonal opposed
incised elements on the rim and vessel body (see Table 45 and Figure 54b-g). These incised sherds are
likely from Davis Incised and Dunkin Incised vessels. Less than 2 percent of the incised sherds have
curvilinear lines or hatched zones.
The most common decorative elements on the incised-punctated sherds are rim and body sherds
with horizontal incised panels filled with large crescent-shaped fingernail punctations (Figure 55a-g; see
also Table 45); 71 percent of the incised-punctated rim sherds are from vessels with these decorative
elements. These sherds are from Weches Fingernail Impressed, var. Weches vessels (see Stokes and
Woodring 1981:Figure 22n-q). These vessels also often have rows of punctations on the vessel bodies
(Figure 55d, h).
Other incised-punctated vessel sherds feature incised triangles filled with punctations (Figure 56a,
e), or horizontal panels filled with small circular punctations (Figure 56b). Other sherds from Dunkin
Incised vessels have horizontal and diagonal as well as horizontal and diagonal opposed incised lines on
the vessel rim and rows of tool punctations or fingernail punctations on the vessel body (Figure 56g-h).
About 16 percent of the incised-punctated sherds are from Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Pennington
Punctated-Incised vessels (Figure 56c-d, f).

Figure 55. Weches Fingernail Impressed rim and body sherds from the Chupik site
(41ML44).
The few brushed body sherds account for only approximately 1 percent of the utility ware assemblage
from the site (see Table 45). The presence of sherds from at least two vessels with brushing decorative
elements suggests that the occupation at the Chupik site likely lasted past ca. A.D. 1200, when brushed
utility ware vessels began to be commonly made in certain East Texas Caddo sites.
Among the fine ware sherds, 96.2 percent are from engraved vessels; the 12 fine ware rim sherds are
from engraved vessels (Table 46). Only 4 percent of the engraved sherds have had a red clay pigment
rubbed in the engraved lines. The remaining 3.8 percent of the fine ware sherds are from red-slipped
vessels, probably from Sanders Slipped bowls or carinated bowls.

108ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Sherds from engraved bottles, likely Holly Fine Engraved vessels (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate
40e, g) have sets of curvilinear engraved lines with opposed vertical and diagonal lines (see Figure 57g)
on the vessel body. Another body sherd from a bottle at the Chupik site has curvilinear engraved lines
and a panel on the vessel body with sets of short curvilinear engraved lines in each of the corners of the
panel (see Figure 57e).
In summary, the ceramic artifacts from the Chupik site are from a component that dates between ca.
A.D. 1000-1200 or a bit after ca. A.D. 1200 (because of the few brushed and brushed-incised sherds in
the assemblage); Krieger (Newell and Krieger 1949:196) and Story (2000) had previously classified the
site as being an Early Caddo Alto focus or phase component.
The three uncorrected radiocarbon dates from the site are A.D. 1060 + 340, A.D. 1190 + 320, and
A.D. 1210 + 260 (Story 1990b:674-675); their extreme standard deviations render these dates of little
analytical value, though their mean date is A.D. 1153. This component has numerous decorated ceramics
of Early Caddo period style, including Pennington Punctated-Incised, Dunkin Incised, Weches Fingernail
Impressed, Holly Fine Engraved, and Hickory Engraved (see Locke 1975:6). Lockeâs (1975:65-66)
preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of a few Chupik ceramic sherds and local clay sources âsuggests
material from the Chupek [sic] site represents trade ware, not locally manufactured pottery.â
There is one bone-tempered long-stemmed Red River style pipe stem sherd in the Chupik site
collections. The sherd is bone-tempered, and has an exterior stem diameter of 10.7 mm; the stem hole
itself is 4.5 mm in diameter. This sherd is probably from the Graves Chapel variety of Red River pipe,
which was made by Caddo groups between ca. A.D. 1000-1200 (Hoffman 1967:9).

Asa Warner (41ML46 or 39D3-2)
The Asa Warner site is on an alluvial terrace of the Brazos River about 12 km southeast of the city of
Waco (Watt 1956:Figure 1; Wright 1997). The TARL collections from the site include collections donated
by J. Shannon and Frank Watt as well as material culture remains from the 1973 Texas Archeological
Society (TAS) Field School (Richmond et al. 1985:149-150; Wright 1997). A total of 425 ceramic sherds
were recovered in the TAS Field School work from at least 10-15 separate vessels of plain ware, utility
ware, and fine ware (Turner 1997:234). Prior to the TAS Field School, the Central Texas Archeological
Society periodically carried out rather extensive excavations at the Asa Warner site (Watt 1941b, 1942,
1953, 1956), exposing habitation deposits and burials.
A wide variety of decorated Caddo ceramic wares were recovered in the Central Texas Archeological
Society excavations, particularly sherds that Watt (1956:23) believed were from East Texas Late Caddo
period Frankston phase vessels; vessel types present were bowls and carinated bowls. There are sherds
with engraved, incised, brushed, and punctated vessels, likely from both pre-A.D. 1400 and post-A.D.
1400 types (Watt 1956:Figure 9a-b) such as Sanders Engraved, Poynor Engraved, Hume Engraved, and
Bullard Brushed. Turner (1997:235) dates most of the ceramics from the Asa Warner site from ca. A.D.
1200-1300, though he concedes that some are from vessels made in the early part of the Late Caddo
period (ca. A.D. 1400-1480), and he considered the ceramics to be Caddo in origin.
A few sherds (n=14) from that work are in the Mayborn Museum Complex holdings. They include
12 plain body sherds, 92 percent from grog-tempered vessels and the remainder from a bone-tempered
vessel. The two decorated sherds include a grog-tempered body sherd with fingernail punctated rows and
a grog-tempered body sherd with parallel brushed-incised marks and lines as well as overlying parallel
incised lines (Figure 58a-b). This particular sherd is from a Spradley Brushed-Incised vessel, made after

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ109
A.D. 1680 by Caddo potters in the Neches-Angelina river basins in East Texas. This sherd suggests a
limited use of the site in historic contact times, likely by a Wichita group that had obtained a Spradley
Brushed-Incised vessel from an Hasinai Caddo group.

Figure 58. Selected decorated sherds from the Asa Warner site in the
Mayborn Museum Complex collections.
There are 311 sherds from ceramic vessels in the TARL collections from the Asa Warner site (Table
47). About 75 percent of the sherds are from grog-tempered vessels, and the remainder are from bonetempered wares. The 159 decorated sherds in the collection include sherds from both utility (67 percent)
and fine ware (33 percent) vessels. The decorated sherd sample discussed herein does not include the
four decorated sherds from the site that were analyzed for instrumental neutron activation analysis and
petrographic analysis (Perttula et al. 2003:14-16 and Figure 3): two engraved sherds, one fingernail
punctated body sherd, and one sherd with diagonal opposed incised lines.

Among the utility ware sherds in the TARL collections from the Asa Warner site, 60.4 percent are
from vessels with incised decorative elements (and 75 percent of the utility ware rims) (Table 48),
another 30.2 percent are from vessels with punctated decorative elements (and 17 percent of the utility
ware rims), 7.5 percent have incised-punctated decorative elements (and 8.3 percent of the utility ware
rims), and 1.9 percent have brushed decorative elements.

The few brushed sherds in the utility ware assemblage (see Table 48) indicate that at least two
jars with brushing marks (at least on the vessel bodies) were used, broken, and discarded at the Asa
Warner site. In East Texas, sherds from brushed utility ware vessels, particularly jars, are a distinctive
characteristic of both Middle, Late, and Historic Caddo sites in much of East Texas. It also appears to be
the case that the relative proportions of brushed utility wares increase through time in those areas where
brushed vessels were made and used, such that sherds with brushing marks may comprise as much as
90 percent of all the decorated sherds in some post-A.D. 1400 East Texas ceramic assemblages. These
sherd data suggest that the Asa Warner site was occupied at least sometime after ca. A.D. 1200. In the
East Texas Caddo ceramic sherd database (Perttula 2015a), only a few ca. A.D. 1200-1430 sites have
assemblages with high proportions (>60 percent of the decorated sherd assemblage) of brushed sherds;
these occur in the mid-Sabine and Big Cypress Creek drainage basins. Late Caddo ceramic assemblages
in East Texas with high proportions of brushed sherds occur in the upper and mid-Neches (Frankston
phase sites), Angelina, middle Sabine and Big Cypress (Titus phase sites), and sites on tributaries of
the Sabine River west of the Toledo Bend Reservoir area (see Perttula 2015a:Figure 5). Caddo ceramic
assemblages without considerable amounts of brushed sherds occur in the upper Sabine, Sulphur, and
Red River basins.
Rims from incised vessels have cross-hatched, diagonal, and horizontal decorative elements (see
Table 48). These are likely from Davis Incised and Dunkin Incised jars. Cross-hatched and opposed
incised line elements are predominant in the body sherds, and there is one distinctive Dunkin Incised
body sherd with diagonal opposed triangle elements (Figure 59a-b).

112ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas

Figure 59. Decorative elements on selected utility ware sherds
from the Asa Warner site (41ML46): a, cross-hatched incised
body sherd; b, Dunkin Incised body sherd; c, Kiam Incised rim
sherd; d, incised-punctated body sherd.
The one incised-punctated rim sherd is from a Kiam Incised jar. The rim has five horizontal
incised lines, with at least two rows of large fingernail punctates on the upper vessel body (see 59c).
Other incised-punctated sherds feature either zones of fingernail or tool punctations adjacent to one or
more straight incised lines, or have diagonal opposed lines forming incised triangles filled with tool
punctations (see Figure 59d). This body sherd may be from a Canton Incised jar.
The engraved rim sherds feature geometric elements, namely cross-hatched lines, diagonal lines,
opposed lines (Figure 60a), or one sherd with a combination of diagonal, rectilinear, and cross-hatched
zone elements (see Table 48). Except for the latter, these engraved sherds are from Sanders Engraved
vessels. Body sherds feature similar decorative elements (Figure 60b). Other engraved sherds have
hatched zones and panels (Figure 60c-d)
One body sherd from a bottle has horizontal and curvilinear engraved lines with excised pendant
triangles (see Figure 60g); Turner (1997:231) suggests this vessel may date to the latter part of the
Middle Caddo period. Ten body sherdsâfour from bottles and six from carinated bowlsâhave engraved
lines and adjacent zones of excised punctations (see Figure 60e-f). These may be from Spiro Engraved
vessels (cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:147 and Plate 74b, f, i). One of the engraved-punctated carinated
bowl sherds has a red pigment rubbed in the engraved lines. Four other engraved sherds also have a red
pigment rubbed in the engraved lines; a total of 9.6 percent of the engraved fine ware sherds from the Asa
Warner site have a red pigment added to the decorative elements.

engraved zone body sherd; c-d, body sherds with hatched zones and panels;
e-f, engraved-punctated bottle body sherds; g, engraved bottle sherd.
The single red-slipped sherd from the Asa Warner site may be from a Sanders Slipped bowl. Redslipped fine wares (bowls, carinated bowls, and an occasional bottle) are a common part of ancestral
Caddo ceramic assemblages in several parts of East Texas, most notably in sites that predate ca. A.D.
1400 in the middle Red River, the Big Cypress Creek basin, the upper Sulphur and Sabine River basins,
and the middle Sabine River basin (Perttula 2015a:Figure 3).
The decorated ceramic assemblage from the Asa Warner site suggests that the main occupation at
the site took place after ca. A.D. 1200, and ended by ca. A.D. 1400, if not earlier. Turner (1997:235)
dates most of the ceramics from the site to the period from ca. A.D. 1200-1300. Turner (1997:235) also
considers the ceramics to be Caddo in origin, and in particular he noted that:
â¦the quantity of pottery sherds was extremely small at Asa Warner. It is possible that some of
the ceramic vessels may have been manufactured at the site, but if so, it was only in very small
numbers. Due to the diversity of paste, coloration, and vessel form observed in the Asa Warner
collection, it is more probable that the vessels were transported to the site from East Texas over
a period of several hundred years. This would indicate that the ceramics are either the product of
short occupations by Caddoan [sic] peoples or conversely the trade of Caddo vessels to a Central
Texas people who did not manufacture their own pottery.
One long-stemmed Red River pipe stem sherd is in the TARL collections from the Asa Warner site. It
is from a bone-tempered pipe, and has 4.0 mm thick stem walls.

114ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Cement Hill 2 Site (41ML66)
The Cement Hill 2 site is on an upland slope just below the Balcones Escarpment, about one mile
south of the South Bosque River and several miles west of the Brazos River (Atlee 2004:Figures 1
and 2). In the 1950s, William A. Atlee collected a number of ancestral Caddo sherds and a large vessel
section from the site, and these sherds are in the holdings of the Mayborn Museum Complex at Baylor
University. The Cement Hill 2 site is separate from, but nearby, the Cement Hill site (41ML43) (Atlee,
1996 personal communication).
Atleeâs ceramic sherd collection has 11 bone-tempered Leon Plain body sherds and 14 sherds from
Caddo vessels likely made by Frankston phase potters from the upper Neches River basin in East Texas,
as well as a large section of a pinched jar. The grog-tempered pinched jar (Figure 61-63; see also Atlee
2004:Figures 3-4) is comprised of more than 30+ conjoined rim and body sherds with a direct rim and
a rounded lip. There is a horizontal pinched ridge that parallels the lip, as well as at least three vertical
pinched ridges that extend down the vessel body to the base; the area of the exterior vessel body between
the ridges has been burnished. Appliqued nodes were added between the pinched ridges. The decoration
on this vessel may be a much-simplified version of Killough Pinched (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 46).

Figure 63. Decorative elements on a reconstructed
drawing of the large jar from the Cement Hill site.

Figure 62. Appliqued decorative element on
the large jar from the Cement Hill site.
The other Caddo vessel sherds from the site include a grog-bone-tempered plain rim, four plain grogtempered body sherds, one from a carinated bowl, four plain grog-bone-tempered body sherds, and five
engraved sherds. One of the engraved sherds is a grog-tempered rim with horizontal and curvilinear lines
(see Atlee 2004:Figure 5), and the other four sherds are from a grog-tempered Poynor Engraved bottle.
The sherds have closely-spaced parallel and curvilinear engraved lines (see Atlee 2004:Figure 6).

Tonk Creek Shelter (41ML119)
There is a single âgrit-temperedâ ceramic vessel sherd from the Tonk Creek Shelter site (Perkins
1956:43) in the Bosque River basin that may be of Caddo manufacture. Both Perdiz and Alba arrow
points have been collected from the site in equal numbers, as well as an obsidian core, but it is not known
which of these arrow point types is associated with the recovered ceramic sherd.

McMillan Site (41ML162)
A plain grog-tempered Caddo vessel sherd was recovered in contexts dating between A.D. 14051455 at the McMillan site at Waco Lake on the Brazos River (Mehalchick and Kibler 2008:179). A
second Caddo vessel sherd in AU 2 is a grog-tempered body sherd with one incised line (Mehalchick and

116ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Kibler 2008:209). Test excavations recovered a single plain shell-tempered body sherd in contexts dating
between 2000-1400 years B.P. (Scott et al. 2002:57, 68), and this is not associated with any Caddo or
East Texas Woodland ceramic wares.
Mehalchick and Kibler (2008:370) argue that there were ties between Waco area peoples and East
Texas Caddo groups, primarily evidenced by Caddo ceramic wares, and that these Waco area peoples
were engaged in trade with the Caddo. The Caddo appear to have brought vessels to the Middle Brazos
River area, perhaps along with perishables like salt and maize, and exchanged these ceramic vessels
for tools of Edwards chert produced by these local peoples (see also Gadus et al. 2006:179-180; Fields
2017).

41ML185
Work reported by Scott et al. (2002:90 and Figure 37) recovered two sherds at 41ML185, the first a
bone-tempered vessel sherd with cross-hatched incised lines, probably from a Maydelle Incised vessel.
The second sherd is a burnished plain bone-tempered body sherd from a Leon Plain vessel. These are
likely associated with a post-A.D. 1200 Toyah phase component at the site.

Warner #1 (39D3-1)
Watt considered the Warner #1, #11, and #12 sites to be part of the Asa Warner site (Watt 1956:7
and Figure 1). However, because their locations are not known relative to the Asa Warner site (Wright
1997:216-217) in the Brazos River floodplain, except that they are in the Brazos River valley nearby, the
ceramic assemblages from these three sites are discussed separately herein.
The sherd sample at the Warner #1 site includes 22 plain or decorated rim and body sherds (Table
49). Only 59 percent of the sherds from the Warner #1 site are from grog-tempered vessels; another 18
percent have both grog and bone temper, and 23 percent are from bone-tempered vessels. The use of bone
temper in the manufacture of these vessels is considerable, at 41 percent of the sherd assemblage.

Seventy-three percent of the decorated sherds (n=11) from Caddo vessels at the site are from utility
ware jars decorated with brushed-punctated elements, incised lines, and punctations (see Table 49). The
brushed-punctated sherd is probably from a Bullard Brushed vessel with a row of fingernail punctations

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ117
adjacent to an area of diagonal brushing (see Suhm and Jelks
1962:21). One of the incised sherds has a cross-hatched
triangle element, another has opposed incised lines (possibly
from a Maydelle Incised vessel), and the third has simply a
single straight incised line. Three of the four punctated body
sherds have rows of fingernail punctations (Figure 64), and
the other has rows of small circular punctates.
The engraved fine ware sherds include one bonetempered body sherd with a single curvilinear engraved
line. Another engraved sherd, from a grog-tempered vessel,
has opposed engraved lines, and the third is from a Poynor
Engraved vessel made after ca. A.D. 1400, although the
variety is uncertain (cf. Perttula 2011:Figure 6-64). This
vessel sherd has closely-spaced parallel engraved lines and a
red clay pigment had been rubbed in the engraved lines.
The combination of Bullard Brushed, Maydelle Incised,
and Poynor Engraved sherds at the Warner #1 site, along
with a number of Leon Plain sherds, suggest the occupation
here post-dates ca. A.D. 1400. The Caddo vessel sherds are
likely from vessels made by Frankston phase potters in the
upper Neches River basin in East Texas.

Warner #11 (39D3-11)
The 92 ceramic vessel sherds in the Warner #11 assemblage (Table 50) include both Leon Plain
sherds (n=33) from a Toyah phase occupation, as well as plain and decorated ancestral Caddo vessel
sherds (n=59) of likely Late Caddo Frankston phase age. There are also three pieces of burned clay in the
Watt collection from the site, along with a single Perdiz arrow point.

118ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
The Caddo sherds in the collection are from vessels tempered with grog (32 percent), grog-bone (37
percent), and bone (31 percent) (see Table 50). The majority of the grog-tempered sherds are from utility
wares with several different kinds of decorative elements, while most of the grog-bone-tempered and
bone-tempered sherds are from plain ware.
The utility ware sherds have predominantly either brushed marks or rows of punctations. The
brushed and brushed-incised sherds are from Bullard Brushed vessels and have opposed brushed marks
(n=1), parallel brushed marks (n=6) (Figure 65a), or parallel brushed-incised marks and lines (n=1). The
punctated rim and body sherds have a row of fingernail punctations that begin below the vessel lip and
also are on the vessel body (Figure 65b-c). The one sherd with an incised decoration in the Warner #1
assemblage has a single horizontal incised line below the vessel lip. The one fine ware sherd from the
Warner #1 site has only a single straight engraved line. The dominance of brushed and brushed-incised
sherds in the decorated sherd collection from the Warner #11 site suggests that the Caddo sherds are from
vessels made after ca. A.D. 1400âin the Late Caddo periodâby potters living in the Neches River basin
in East Texas.

Warner #12 (39D3-12)
Both ancestral Caddo vessel sherds (n=57) and local Toyah phase bone-tempered Leon Plain vessel
sherds (n=8) are in the Warner #12 sherd collection assembled by Frank Watt (Table 51). About 98
percent of the sherds from Caddo vessels have been manufactured with grog temper, either as the sole
temper (82 percent) or in combination with burned bone temper (16 percent); the remaining sherd in the
assemblage is from a bone-tempered vessel.

The 17 decorated sherds are divided between utility wares (71 percent) and fine wares (29 percent)
(see Table 51); almost all of these sherds are from grog-tempered vessels. Among the utility wares are
two body sherds from a Bullard Brushed vessel with a single appliqued node (Figure 66a; see Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plate 11b). Five of the sherds have brushed and brushed-incised marks and lines, including
parallel brushed (n=3) and parallel brushed-incised (n=1) sherds from Bullard Brushed jars. Another
sherd has opposed brushed marks and overlying parallel incised lines (Figure 66c). Two of the sherds
with an incised decoration have either a straight incised line or cross-hatched incised lines; this sherd
is likely from a Maydelle Incised jar. The third incised sherd is a grog-tempered rim from a Crockett
Curvilinear Incised bowl with a slanted scroll motif and adjacent triangular areas filled with diagonal
hatched lines. Both punctated sherds have rows of fingernail punctations on the vessel body (Figure 66b).

Figure 66. Selected decorated sherds from the Warner #12 site in McLennan County, Texas.

120ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
One of the fine ware sherds is from
a Poynor Engraved bottle sherd with a
set of curvilinear engraved lines above
a straight engraved line with excised
tick marks (Figure 67a). Another
Poynor Engraved sherd has closelyspaced parallel engraved lines. A third
engraved body sherd has horizontal and
vertical engraved lines, while two grogtempered body sherds have a curvilinear
engraved zone filled with hatched
lines, and the other has sets of diagonal
opposed engraved lines (Figure 67b);
this latter sherd may be from a regional
variety of Poynor Engraved (see Perttula
2011:Figure 6-65).

are primarily from Frankston phase (ca.
A.D. 1400-1680) engraved, brushed, and incised vessels. These levels were likely made by Caddo potters
living in communities in the upper Neches River basin. The one Crockett Curvilinear Incised rim sherd in
the assemblage is indicative of some use of the site prior to ca. A.D. 1200, and it was perhaps occupied at
about the same time as the nearby Asa Warner site (see Turner 1997).

Mass Burial Site (No. Trinomial)
This site, found near the Waco Sewage Disposal Plant, has an engraved ceramic ear spool of likely
Caddo manufacture, as well as Perdiz arrow points (Meroney 1936:Figure 6:1). Th ear spool is decorated
with a central engraved circle or dot that has six radiating engraved lines.

Wattâs Sites No. 9, 13, and 21
Sites No. 9 and No. 21 (n=8 sherds) are on Aquilla Creek in northern McLennan County (Watt
1953:Figure 26). According to Watt, these sherds are from Frankston phase vessels, although he does
not indicate the kinds of decorations or types represented in the assemblages from these sites. Site No.
13, the Gas Bridge site, is on the Brazos River, just south of the city of Waco in the early 1950s. The two
ceramic sherds found were described as Bullard Brushed (Watt 1953:84).
Also found at the site were glass trade beads (Watt 1953:84). It is possible that the Gas Bridge site
is the same as the Gas Plant site excavated by Jensen (1967:45-50) for the Pilot Study of Wichita Indian
Archeology and Ethnohistory, as the Gas Plant site was about 2 miles below the center of the City of
Waco, and sat between the Brazos River and highway and railroad overpasses. In Jensenâs work, no
ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from the site (Jensen 1967:47).

K. H. Aynesworth Collection
This accessioned collection in the Mayborn Museum Complex has only a general McLennan County
provenience. There are 36 ceramic sherds from likely Late Caddo period Frankston phase ceramic vessels
in this collection, including sherds from plain ware (55.6 percent), utility ware (38.9 percent), and fine
ware (5.6 percent) (Table 52).

These sherds are primarily from vessels tempered with grog (88.9 percent), but a significant
percentage of the sherds (25 percent) are from vessels with either grog and bone temper or solely
tempered with burned bone (see Table 52). More than 31 percent of the sherds with decorative elements
are from vessels that have grog temper.
Among the utility ware sherds, more than 42 percent have incised decorative elements. This includes a
body sherd from a Maydelle Incised jar with vertical and diagonal incised lines, another with vertical incised
lines, as well as sherds with parallel incised lines (n=4). Sherds with brushing (parallel and overlapping marks)
and parallel brushed-incised marks and lines comprise 25 percent of the decorated sherds in the collection, and
28.6 percent of the utility wares; these sherds are likely from Bullard Brushed vessels. The punctated sherds
have rows of either fingernail (n=2) or tool (n=2) marks on vessel body sherds.
One bone-tempered body sherd has a single straight engraved line. The other, from a grog-tempered
Poynor Engraved vessel, has curvilinear engraved zones filled with diagonal hatched lines (see Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plate 63h-j),

Elmer and Maude Hawkins CollectionâCharles Pierce Farm
This site in the community of Mount Pleasant in McLennan County has three Caddo vessel sherds
from three different grog-tempered Late Caddo period vessels. The first sherd has parallel appliqued
fillets with a row of tool punctations between the fillets, while the second sherd has closely-spaced
parallel appliqued ridges, possibly from a Cass Appliqued jar (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 13). The third
sherd has parallel brushing marks. Taken together, the decorated sherds suggest an occupation that well
post-dates A.D. 1400.

Only a single plain grog-tempered body sherd from a Caddo vessel is in the Camp 3 collection in the
Navasota River basin.

Elmer and Maude Hawkins CollectionâFadul Farm
The Fadul Farm is on the North Bosque River in McLennan County, a few miles from its confluence
with the Brazos River. There are 15 sherds from the site in the Mayborn Museum Complex; all the
sherds are from grog-tempered vessels. Ten of the sherds are undecorated, including two body sherds
from bottles. The five decorated sherds have parallel incised lines (n=2) as decorative elements, parallel
incised lines adjacent to a tool punctated row (probably from a Canton Incised or Maydelle Incised
vessel) (n=1), tool punctated row (n=1), and a body sherd with opposed engraved lines.

Elmer and Maude Hawkins CollectionâGeneâs Farm, Navasota Creek
This collection has three grog-tempered plain body sherds. One of the sherds is from a carinated
bowl, and accordingly is clearly of Caddo manufacture.

Elmer and Maude Hawkins CollectionâHughes on Aquilla Creek
There are 23 Caddo ceramic sherds in this collection at the Mayborn Museum Complex. Most are
from grog-tempered vessels (82.6 percent), but four plain ware sherds (17.4 percent) have both grog and
bone temper (Table 53). This is probably the Chupik site (41ML44), previously discussed, since Frank
Watt campsite designations referred to it as the Chupek-Hughes site on Aquilla Creek.

line.

Elmer and Maude Hawkins CollectionâWhite Rock Creek
White Rock Creek is a southern-flowing tributary to the Brazos River. The collection from the site
at the Mayborn Museum Complex includes only a single grog-tempered base sherd. This is from an
ancestral Caddo vessel made sometime after ca. A.D. 900.

Medina County
Tarpley (41ME147)
Caddo ceramic vessel sherds were recovered
in the Toyah phase midden in Area 4 (Thomas R.
Hester, February 2017 personal communication). This
includes a fingernail-punctated body sherd (Figure 68)
and rim sherds from Vessel 3 with sets of horizontal
and vertical incised lines (Figure 69). This midden
may have been in use as late as the early 18th century
given the recovery of at least three Guerrero arrow
points in Area 4. A conventional radiocarbon age of
560 + 15 B. P. (UCIAMS TS 71-4) was also obtained
from bison bone in the Area 4 archaeological deposits,
but Thomas R. Hester (December 11, 2017 personal
communication) suggests that the deposits âactually
dated ca. 1710 or so because of 2 or 3 Guerrero points.â Figure 68. Fingernail punctated sherds from
the Tarpley site (41ME147).

124ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Milam County
41MM341
A total of 13 ceramic sherds from 41MM341 on the Little River were examined by Perttula (2001)
during test excavations at the site. They are in a prehistoric component estimated to date about cal. A.D.
1010-1190 (Mahoney and Tomka 2001:50 and Table 7-13).
The sherds are from two vessels. The first vessel (n=11 undecorated sherds) has finely crushed and
burned bone temper inclusions, and it has been fired in a reducing environment (see Teltser 1993:Figure
2B). The sherds are from the body of a thick-walled vessel, probably a jar; the body wall thickness
ranges from 6.9-9.4 mm, with a mean of 8.8 + 0.6 mm. Two of the body sherds have a smoothed exterior
surface, and one has remnants of an organic residue from use of the vessel for cooking foodstuffs.
The second vessel has two sherds from a carinated bowl with bone and grog temper, and the clay
paste is sandy. The carinated bowl had been fired in a reducing environment and cooled in a high oxygen
environment (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2F). Body wall thickness ranges from 7.9-8.4 mm, with a mean of
8.15 + 0.25 mm. One of the carinated bowl sherds has a single broad horizontal incised line above the
carination, and it is likely that the decorative element consists of multiple horizontal incised lines on the
rim of the vessel.
The limited amount of bone in the paste of both vessels (less than 10 percent of the paste), the thick
body walls, and the absence of well-burnished exterior and interior surfaces indicates that the first vessel
is not from a post-A.D. 1250 Leon Plain vessel. Whether it is a locally-made vessel is unknown, although
this seems a reasonable conclusion. The occurrence of grog in the incised carinated bowl strongly
suggests that this vessel was made in the East Texas Caddo area. Grog temper is widely used in Caddo
vessels of all time periods, and the carinated bowl form also appears to be a Caddo innovation in East
Texas (see Perttula 2013), and throughout the Caddo area.
During the data recovery work, four additional ceramic sherds were recovered from a component
that Gadus et al. (2006:136) suggest may date from the early 15th century. However, since the main
component is estimated by Gadus et al. (2006:136) to date from ca. A.D. 900-1300, and Mahoney and
Tomka (2001) argue that the principal component dates from cal. A.D. 1010-1190, it seems reasonable to
suggest that the ceramic sherds from both phases of work belong with this component; the one decorated
ancestral Caddo vessel sherd is of no help in establishing more specifically the age range of this
component.
The sherds found in the data recovery work are either bone-tempered or simply have a sandy paste
with no temper. Gadus et al. (2006:125) suggest that âceramics are so sparse [at the site] that it is clear
that ceramic vessels did not play any significant role in activities performed at the site.â Gadus et al.
(2006:177) go on to suggest that the Caddo style ceramics found at 41MM341 are likely the product of
âlocal groups interacting with east Texas Caddo groups through trade, marriage, or visitation.â These
sherds, as well as the thick bone-tempered plain ware sherds found during the test excavations, appear to
have been made by a local Little River group and do not represent Caddo vessels. Only the bone-grogtempered carinated body sherds from one vessel decorated with incised lines is considered to be of Caddo
manufacture.

Victor Turner Collection
The Victor Turner collection from an unrecorded site in Milam County has three lower rim and body
sherds from an ancestral Caddo vessel with incised decorative elements (Figure 70). The lower part of
the rim has incised triangles filled with incised lines pitched in opposite directions, and the upper part of
the vessel body has horizontal incised lines. These sherds are from an Early Caddo period Dunkin Incised
vessel (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 19b).

Mills County
Trotter site (41MI4)
The Trotter site (41MI4) is located in the Colorado River basin in the Lampasas Cut Plain. There
are five burned rock middens present there, along with a rock shelter. Ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel
sherds (n=24) have been recovered from a surface collection at the site, along with two Leon Plain sherds
(Saylor 1974:22). The same surface collection is dominated by Scallorn arrow points, suggesting that the
Caddo sherds may be from a pre-A.D. 1200 occupation at the site, though the presence of Perdiz arrow
points and Leon Plain ceramic vessel sherds points to the use of the site during the post-A.D. 1200 Toyah
phase.
The illustrated Caddo ceramic rim and body sherds are from a jar that has horizontal and vertical
rows of fingernail punctations (Saylor 1974:Illustration XI), including a horizontal row of punctations
just below the vessel lip. These sherds may be from the same vessel, although Saylor (1974) did not
provide any information on their temper or firing conditions.

Roby 4:5 (41NL19)
This site investigated by E. B. Sayles in the early 1930s has both Toyah phase Leon Plain ceramic
sherds as well as ancestral Caddo vessel sherds. The latter include two plain grog-tempered body sherds
and a grog-tempered body sherd from a jar with two or more tool punctated rows.

San Saba County
Fall Creek No. 2 (41SS2)
Jackson (1938:110-111) recovered 78 ceramic sherds from this site at Lake Buchanan on the
Colorado River. Most of these sherds (n=61 or 78 percent) were identified as originating in East Texas
Caddo sites, specifically in sites occupied by ancestors of the Hasinai Caddo in the Neches-Angelina
river basins. They came from primarily 15-30 cm bs in Midden No. 1 (Jackson 1938:45). Midden No.
2 at this site had another 28 ceramic vessel sherds (Jackson 1938:49), and Shelter No. 2 had one sherd
(Jackson 1938:53). Decorations on these sherds were described by Jackson (1938:112) as having âincised
and raised designs, some of which were identical with certain pottery decoration in East Texas.â
The TARL collections from Midden 1 at the Fall Creek No. 2 site (41SS2) have both Toyah
phase Leon Plain bone-tempered ceramics as well as two ancestral Caddo ceramic sherds. One is a
bone-tempered body sherd with parallel brushing marks (INAA, UT00297), likely from a Bullard
Brushed vessel made in the Angelina, Neches, or mid-Sabine River basins in East Texas (see Perttula
2015a:Figure 11). The other is a plain grog-tempered jar sherd.

Finis Frost (41SS20)
A single plain grog-tempered body sherd of possible ancestral Caddo origin is present in the small
ceramic assemblage at the Finis Frost site, a Toyah phase component on Richland Springs Creek in the
Colorado River basin (Green and Hester 1973:81, 83). The sherd is described as smudged on the exterior
surface, light brown on the interior surface, and ranges from 4.0-7.0 mm in thickness. Green and Hester
(1973:81) note that grog-tempered sherds have been identified in sites at the nearby Robert Lee Reservoir
on the Colorado River (Shafer 1969:71).

41SS28/177
This Toyah phase site is on an alluvial terrace of the San Saba River, and has an ancestral Caddo
ceramic vessel sherd with parallel incised lines (Figure 71, INAA, UT00385) (Prikryl et al. 2010:178179). This sherd is likely from a Maydelle Incised vessel. Another grog-tempered sherd with a straight
incised line (INAA, UT00378) is in the TARL collections. Buddy Whitley has also recovered a
plain grog-tempered body sherd from the site (Figure 72a-b). Charles Hixson (July 2017, personal
communication) also reports that a brushed sherd has been recovered at an unrecorded site about 1.6 km
downstream from 41SS28/177.

Baker (41SS192)
A bone-tempered brushed sherd from an ancestral Caddo vessel has been found at the Baker site
(41SS192) during excavations by the Llano Uplift Archeological Society (Charles Hixson, July 2017

128ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
personal communication). The Baker site is a large Toyah phase encampment on the San Saba river. A
Cuney arrow point, associated with Historic Caddo sites in the Neches-Angelina river basins in East Texas
(Perttula and Marceaux 2018:Table 8), was found in the same unit and level as the brushed vessel sherd.
Continued excavations by the Llano Uplift Society in 2017 has recovered additional Caddo ceramic
vessel sherds in the archaeological deposits at the Baker site, in association with bone-tempered Leon
Plain sherds, and I have had an opportunity to look at a sample of the sherds (n=23) for this project.
According to Hixson (January 2018 personal communication), work at the site has recovered 70 sherds
from the surface, shovel tests, and 1 x 1 m units. The density of ceramic vessel sherds (n=57) in the
excavations is a low 1.84 sherds per square meter.
In the sample of 23 ceramic vessel sherds I examined from the Baker site, 10 are body sherds from
bone-tempered Leon Plain vessels. Based on differences in firing conditions and body wall thickness,
these body sherds are from at least six different vessels. The other 13 rim, body, and base sherds in the
sample are from grog, grog-bone, and bone-tempered Caddo vessels that were found on the surface, in
ST 18 (40-60 cm bs), and in a number of units (Units 7, 10, 18, 22, 23, 28, and 31); the sherds in the units
came from 5-25 cm bs (Table 54). The area of the site that has ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds is at
least 3 acres in size (Charles Hixson, January 2018 personal communication).

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ129
The 13 sherds from ancestral Caddo ceramic vessels include one rim sherds, 11 body sherds, and
one base sherd. They are from vessels tempered with grog (n=5), grog-bone (n=6), and bone (n=2) (see
Table 54). Seven of the sherds have no decoration, while the other six are from either brushed (n=3) and
fingernail punctated (n=1) utility wares, or are from fine wares with engraved (n=2) decorative elements.
Most of the Caddo ceramic vessel sherds have been smoothed on one or both vessel surfaces (see
Table 54); one engraved bottle sherd has been burnished on its exterior surface. All of the sherds are
from vessels fired in a reducing or low oxygen environment, and 61 percent are from vessels that were
subsequently cooled in the open air.
The one Caddo vessel rim is 5.6 mm in thickness. Body sherds range from 4.8-9.1 mm in thickness,
indicating that different vessel forms and/or sizes are represented in the assemblage of Caddo vessel
sherds from the Baker site. The one base sherd is thick (12.5 mm) and has a flat disk shape.
Three of the decorated Caddo vessel sherds at the Baker site have parallel brushing marks on the
vessel body (see Table 54); these are from Late Caddo period Bullard Brushed jars. Another body sherd
has a single row of fingernail punctations. The remaining two decorated sherds are from engraved fine
ware vessels. The first is a bone-tempered rim that has diagonal and opposed engraved lines, and the
second is a body sherd from a bottle. This sherd has a vertical engraved line, probably part of a vertical
panel, with diagonal opposed engraved lines to either side of the vertical line (Figure 73). The sherd is
probably from either a Hume Engraved or Poynor Engraved bottle with an elongated body and a short
neck (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plates 42a-c, e and 63a-g). Such vessels were made in the Neches/
Angelina river basins in East Texas from ca. A.D. 1400 to at least ca. A.D. 1680, and the sherd from the
engraved bottle at the Baker site originated in that area (as did the Bullard Brushed jar sherds); Hume
Engraved vessels were most commonly manufactured after ca. A.D. 1560, at least in the upper Neches
River basin (see Perttula 2011).

The collection of ancestral Caddo sherds is dominated by utility wares, including appliqued (n=1),
brushed (n=25, INAA, UT00269 and UT00270), incised (n=15), incised-punctated (n=1), tool punctated
(n=1), and one fine ware sherd has an engraved element. The appliqued body sherd has a single straight
appliqued ridge, while the brushed sherds have horizontal or vertical brushed marks on rims and parallel
brushing marks on body sherds. The sherds with incised elements have broad horizontal incised lines on
rims, and parallel or straight incised lines on body sherds. The one incised-punctated sherd has horizontal
incised lines with diagonal linear tool punctations (Figure 74a). The one engraved sherd is from a bottle,
and has a portion of an engraved snake head element
(Figure 74b). Engraved snake elements are found on a wide
range of ancestral Caddo sites in the Sabine and NechesAngelina river basins in East Texas, primarily dating to the
Middle Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1200-1400) (Hart 2014;
Walters 2006). The frequency of brushed sherds among
the decorated Caddo sherds in the assemblage (55 percent)
is consistent with East Texas Caddo pottery assemblages
dating after ca. A.D. 1300-1400.

There are two ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds in the TARL collections from the site. One is
a plain grog-bone-tempered body sherd (INAA, UT00214), and the other is a grog-tempered Bullard
Brushed body sherd (INAA, UT00213) with parallel brushing marks and a tool punctated row pushed
through the brushing.

41TA125
This site has two ancestral Caddo grog-tempered sherds in the TARL collections, probably dating
to Historic Caddo times. The first sherd is a Lindsay Grooved body sherd with parallel grooved lines
and opposed incised lines; this type of ceramics was made after ca. A.D. 1680 in the Neches-Angelina
River basins in East Texas (see Marceaux 2011). The other is a grog-tempered body sherds with parallel
brushed-incised marks and lines, probably from a Bullard Brushed vessel.

There are Leon Plain sherds in the ceramic sherd assemblage from
41TG45 as well as two ancestral Caddo sherds; the site is on the South
Concho River not far from 41TG91 (Creel 1990:143, and see below).
One is a grog-tempered body sherd with parallel brushing marks
(Bullard Brushed, INAA UT00059) and the other is a grog-tempered
Historic Caddo Patton Engraved body sherd (INAA, UT00054) with
parallel engraved lines and excised tick marks (Figure 75). Creel
(1990:143; see also Creel et al. 2013:75) notes that there are several
sherds from Patton Engraved vessels in the assemblage, as well as
at least two other engraved vessels and another vessel with incised
decorative elements. Creel (1990:143) also further comments that the
larger sherd collections from Tom Green County sites have sherds:

resembling various Caddoan [sic] wares from East Texas.

41TG48
The TARL collections from this site on the South Concho River (Creel 1990:143) include both Leon
Plain body sherds and ancestral Caddo ceramic sherds. These include a grog-bone-tempered body sherd
with parallel incised lines (Maydelle Incised, INAA UT0048) and a bone-tempered body sherd with
parallel brushing marks (Bullard Brushed, INAA UT0047). The Caddo sherds likely date to post-A.D.
1400 times and are associated with Caddo settlements in the Neches River basin in East Texas.

132ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
41TG91
There is a large assemblage of ceramic vessel sherds at 41TG91 on the South Concho River, namely
447 sherds from at least 18 individual vessels. The ceramics are from the Toyah phase occupation at the
site (Creel 1990:135). Likely ancestral Caddo ceramics at the site include seven sherds in Group 2 sherds
with âstraight engraved linesâ are from what is presumed to be a bone-tempered olla (Creel 1990:136).
One of the Group 8 sherds is decorated with a single incised line.

Rush (41TG346)
The Rush site has intact Toyah phase archaeological deposits dated to ca. A.D. 1575 (Quigg and
Peck 1995:164). The 184 ceramic vessel sherds in Occupation 4 are from seven different vessels, one of
which (Vessel 5) is a grog [clay-grit]-bone-tempered jar with parallel and overlapping brushing marks
(Quigg and Peck 1995:Figure 5.46), likely a Bullard Brushed jar made by a Frankston phase Caddo
potter. According to Quigg and Peck (1995:146), this vessel âhas construction attributes that support an
interpretation that it was manufactured by a woman other than those women forming the core female
population of the Toyah group.â This group made undecorated bone-tempered bowls and jars.
The one ancestral Caddo ceramic sherd from 41TG346 in the TARL collections is a grog-tempered
body sherd with parallel brushing marks (INAA, UT00303). It is likely from a Bullard Brushed vessel.

41TG424
There is a single ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherd in the TARL collections from 41TG424. It is
a grog-tempered body sherd from a Belcher Ridged jar with parallel ridge elements (INAA, UT00354).
Belcher Ridged is a ceramic type manufactured on the Red River in northwest Louisiana and southwest
Arkansas after ca. A.D. 1500 by Belcher phase Caddo potters.

Ben M. Cox Collection (41TG541)
This TARL collection has both Leon Plain bone-tempered sherds, a thicker plain bone-tempered
ware, and six ancestral Caddo ceramic sherds from at least three separate vessels. One is a plain body
sherd from a grog-tempered bottle, while four others have either parallel (n=3, INAA, UT00152) or
horizontal (n=10 brushing marks. The horizontal brushed sherd is a rim sherd from a grog-tempered jar.
The last ancestral Caddo sherd is from a grog-tempered vessel that has rows of fingernail punctations
(INAA, UT00153).

Travis County
Nancy Edwards Collection (41TV5)
This collection from a site along the Colorado River in Montopolis, Texas, has a number of Toyah
phase Leon Plain sherds (n=77), as well as a thicker bone-tempered ware of uncertain type with a sandy
paste (n=147). There is also a good bit of plain and decorated ancestral Caddo ceramic wares tempered
with grog (93 percent), grog-bone (2 percent), or bone (4.8 percent) (Table 56).

The decorated sherds in the assemblage are from Caddo utility wares. They include bone-tempered
sherds with parallel brushed marks and a Bullard Brushed body sherd with parallel brushed marks and
a tool punctated row pushed through the brushing. The grog-tempered utility wares, one rim sherd and
six body sherds, have the following decorative elements: a straight incised line; opposed incised lines
(probably from a Maydelle Incised vessel); parallel brushed (INAA, UT00142); parallel brushed-incised
marks and lines; a rim sherd with a row of fingernail punctations below the vessel lip; a body sherd with
rows of fingernail punctations; and another body sherd with a linear row of tool punctations.

41TV29
One or two probable ancestral Caddo ceramic body sherds are in the TARL collections from 41TV29.
The first sherd, bone-tempered, has a single tool punctate decorative element. Another body sherd, grogbone-tempered (INAA, UT00295), has horizontal brushing marks adjacent to a row of tool punctations.
This sherd is likely from a Bullard Brushed jar.

Collins (41TV40)
The Collins site is on Onion Creek, only a few miles upstream from the confluence of Onion Creek
and the Colorado River. Excavations reported by Suhm (1955, 1956) recovered 849 ceramic vessels from
0-18 inches bs in Toyah phase archaeological deposits. These sherds were sorted into Leon Plain (234
sherds from 2-5 vessels), including some bone-tempered sherds from thicker (6-10 mm) vessels (Suhm
1956:12). One of the bone-tempered sherds had a small appliqued node, and another had a loop handle.
Two different sherds with a Leon Plain paste had incised decorative elements, and 613 sherds were from
what was defined by Suhm as Boothe Brushed jars (Suhm 1956:Plates 1a-i and 2:ii-jj).
Boothe Brushed jars had either bone temper or no visible temper, were smoothed on their interior
surfaces, had thin vessel walls (3-7 mm), everted rims, and flat lips. The jars were estimated to be
between 18-25 cm in height and 14-18 cm in orifice diameter. Decorations on the jars included horizontal
or vertical brushing on the rim, and horizontal or vertical brushing on the vessel body; 1-2 rows of tool
punctations were placed at the rim-body juncture or below the lip, and there were vertical appliqued
fillets on the body, as well as appliqued nodes just below the lip.
Suhm (1956:16) considered Boothe Brushed vessels as being of local manufacture by a Toyah phase
group, primarily based on observed links to Leon Plain, in particularly their bone-tempered pastes; Creel
et al. (2013) INAA findings appear to support their local Central Texas manufacture. Suhm (1956:16)
did note the close similarity between Boothe Brushed and ancestral Caddo Bullard Brushed vessels, âbut
Boothe Brushed differs considerably in paste and somewhat in vessel shape, size, and mode of brushing.
It is not Caddoan [sic] trade ware and probably was made at the Collins site.â

134ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Recent examination of the ceramic vessel sherds from the Collins site does indicate that there are
ancestral Caddo sherds in the assemblage, based both on the presence of grog temper in sherds as well as
distinctive decorative elements on the sherds (Table 57). These 70 sherds are from grog-tempered (80.3
percent) and grog-bone-tempered (19.7 percent) vessels, almost exclusively utility wares.

The one plain grog-tempered body sherd (INAA, UT00114) is from a vessel that has been burnished
on both interior and exterior surfaces, likely a bowl or carinated bowl. The one fine ware grog-tempered
body sherd (probably from a carinated bowl) has a horizontal engraved line and several connecting
diagonal engraved lines; the typological identification is undetermined. The ancestral Caddo identified
utility wares at the Collins site are almost exclusively brushed, brushed-incised, brushed-punctated
(where the punctations were either pushed through the brushing, or are in rows above or below brushing
marks on the rim or body), or brushed-punctated-appliqued (Table 58) sherds from Bullard Brushed
vessels. One brushed-incised sherd with a diagonal incised line cutting across parallel brushing marks
may be from a Spradley Brushed-Incised vessel, an Historic Caddo type present in the Neches-Angelina
river basins in East Texas.

The remainder of the grog or grog-bone-tempered utility ware sherds at the Collins site include
only one incised and one incised-punctated body sherd (see Table 58). The incised sherd has a
rectilinear incised line creating a zone filled with diagonal incised lines. The other body sherd may be
from a Maydelle Incised vessel with a set of parallel incised lines adjacent to a row of horizontal tool
punctations.
Perhaps the most intriguing ceramic vessel sherds at the Collins are a number of bone-tempered
body (n=15) and rim (n=1) sherds with rectilinear and curvilinear brown painted bands (Figure 76).
Such sherds are common in early and late 18th century South Texas and coastal missions such as Mission
Espiritu Santo at Goliad (41GD1, Mounger 1959), Mission Refugio (41RF1, Perttula 2002b:Table 9c7), and at the San Antonio missions (see Fox and Ulrich 2008:40 and Figure 4-2); they are particularly
common in the central coastal plains missions (Steve Tomka, April 2017 personal communication), and
may have been made by Aranama potters. That this mission-era pottery occurs at the Collins site along
with a number of Guerrero arrow points (Suhm 1955:Plate 2j-n), and a single Cuney arrow point (Suhm
1955:Plate 2v), strongly suggests that there is an 18th century aboriginal occupation at the Collins site.
Some of the ancestral Caddo sherds identified in the assemblage may be associated with this component.
In combination with Guerrero arrow points at the nearby Smith Rockshelter (see below) and late 17thearly 19th century calibrated radiocarbon dates further suggest that there may have been a community
of aboriginal peoples periodically using the Onion Creek valley in Historic times. Although there are a
number of ethnic/tribal possibilities (e.g., Kenmotsu and Arnn 2012), perhaps they were one of the TransColorado River tribes (Foster 1995:Map 1).

Figure 76. Brown painted rim sherd with brown painted bands and a loop

Smith Rockshelter (41TV42)
Excavations reported by Story (1956, 1957) recovered 229 ceramic vessel sherds in a Toyah
phase or later early Historic occupation (based on the recovery of several Guerrero style arrow points)
archaeological deposit (Occupation XI) from the Smith Rockshelter on Onion Creek near the Colorado
River. Three main sherd groupings include 29 sherds from a Leon Plain jar, 27 sherds from a sandy paste
(possible Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified) vessel, though unlikely to be Goose Creek Plain given the
much earlier age of sandy paste pottery in the region compared to the age of Occupation/Zone XI), and
159 sherds from a plain and relatively thick-walled (6-9 mm in thickness) shell-tempered and sandy paste
vessel (a bowl or a jar, perhaps related to Nocona Plain) (Story 1957:Plate 9p-r).
Three uncorrected radiocarbon dates from 0-6 inches bs in Zone XI at the Smith Rockshelter range
from 240 + 70 years B.P. to 200 + 70 years B.P. (Valastro and Davis 1970:271), with a mean uncorrected
age range of 220 + 70 years B.P., or A.D. 1660-1800. Shafer and Hester (2014:19) note that âthese are
among the youngest dates thus far obtained on a Toyah assemblage,â and these dates also indicate that
the ancestral Caddo sherds from Zone XI date to Historic Caddo period times. Dates of A.D. 1739-1820
and A.D. 1626-1813 were recalculated by Johnson (1994:258).
Among the 14 miscellaneous sherds in the collection is an ancestral Caddo vessel rim sherd with
incised lines, probably from a Maydelle Incised vessel, and six plain body sherds from an ancestral
Caddo grog-tempered vessel with exterior burnishing (INAA, UT00129). Two bone-tempered ceramic
strap handles are also in the ceramic collection from the Smith Rockshelter.

Sneed (41TV104)
The only ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherd in the TARL collections from 41TV104 is a plain
grog-tempered body sherd (INAA, UT00139).

Hillcrest Bluff (41TV142)
This site has Toyah phase Leon Plain pottery sherds as well as a single plain grog-bone-tempered
Caddo body sherd in the TARL collections that is 7.0 mm in thickness (INAA, UT00033).

Toyah Bluff (41TV441)
Investigations at the Toyah Bluff site on an Onion Creek terrace in the Colorado River basin
recovered 48 ceramic vessel sherds that Karbula (2003:75) divided into three different groups. Groups 1
and 2 include sherds from bone-tempered Leon Plain vessels, although two of the sherds placed in Group
1 are plain grog-bone-tempered body sherds, and likely to not belong in this group. Ceramic Group 3
has grog (n=3), grog-bone (n=4), and grog/sandy paste sherds (n=3), and may actually represent parts of
several different ancestral Caddo vessels. The one decorated sherd in Ceramic Group 3 is a grog-bonetempered body sherd with parallel brushing marks, likely from an East Texas Bullard Brushed vessel.

Uvalde County
Kincaid Rockshelter (41UV2)
In addition to Toyah phase bone-tempered sherds in the ceramic assemblage, there is a grog-tempered
rim sherd (INAA, UT00093) from an ancestral Caddo jar, probably Bullard Brushed, with horizontal
brushing marks. The jar has a 23.0 cm orifice diameter.

Williamson County
Cedar Park Mound (41WM8)
In addition to sherds from Leon Plain vessels, there are grogtempered sherds from three different ancestral Caddo vessels at the
Cedar Park Mound site. One is a plain grog-tempered body sherd,
another seven are from Vessel 2, a grog-tempered engraved vessel,
and a third is from a grog-tempered body sherd with parallel
brushing marks (INAA, UT00136). The vessel sherds from Vessel
2 are from a post-A.D. 1680 Patton Engraved vessel that has
horizontal and diagonal engraved lines with triangular excised tick
marks (Figure 77). Such vessels were made after A.D. 1680 by
Hasinai Caddo potters of the Allen phase, who lived in the NechesAngelina River basins in East Texas.

Cluck Spring (41WM24)
Fragments of a single grog-tempered Holly Fine Engraved vessel, likely a deep bowl (see Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plates 39f, h and 40f) was recovered by J. E. Pearce in 1929 at the Cluck Spring site. The
vessel has a series of concentric engraved semi-circles, diagonal engraved lines, and small excised semicircles on the rim and body of the vessel (Figure 78). A white kaolin clay pigment has been rubbed into
the engraved lines by the Caddo potter. Holly Fine Engraved vessels were generally manufactured by the
Caddo from ca. A.D. 900-1200.

vessel sherds from the Cluck Spring site, Williamson
County, Texas.

Barker (41WM71)
This site has both Toyah phase bone-tempered Leon Plain sherds (n=2) as well as ancestral Caddo
ceramic sherds in the TARL collections; Sorrow (1970:17) indicated that there were originally 34 Leon
Plain bone-tempered sherds from three vessels (Vessels 3-5). The Caddo ceramic sherds include a plain
grog-bone-tempered body sherd and bone-tempered body sherds with parallel brushed-incised marks
and lines (Figure 79a-b); the brushed sherds are from Vessel 2 (Sorrow 1970:15). There also is a very
distinctive everted rim jar with an incised decoration on the rim and upper vessel body, as well as two
small loop handles (Figure 79c-f); Sorrow (1970:15) labeled this as Vessel 1, and he noted that there were
29 sherds in the collections from this vessel at the Barker site.

Figure 79. Vessel 1 from the Barker site (from Sorrow 1970:Figure 5) and brushed-incised body sherds.
The vessel is tempered with bone, grog, and angular quartzite fragments. The decorative motif
includes opposed sets of diagonally incised triangles pendant from the rim and upper body juncture (see
Figure 79e-f). There are also two horizontal incised lines that circle the vessel at the upper body juncture
and below the lower set of diagonally incised triangles. The use of opposed and pendant incised and
engraved triangles in zones around the rim is common in East Texas Caddo ceramics, typically ceramics
made after ca. A.D. 1400 in Frankston phase contexts (see Perttula 2011).

41WM118
There are four ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds of unknown age in the TARL collection from
41WM118, although the one probable Holly Fine Engraved sherd suggests they date before ca. A.D.
1200. Three are plain grog-tempered body sherds (INAA, UT00040) that have been burnished on both
interior and exterior surfaces, suggesting they are from the undecorated portions of a carinated bowl.
The fourth sherd is a grog-tempered body sherd (INAA, UT00046) from a carinated bowl with diagonal
engraved lines, probably from a Holly Fine Engraved vessel.

140ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Bryan Fox (41WM124)
A single plain grog-tempered body sherd in the TARL collections is from a ceramic vessel
manufactured by an ancestral Caddo potter sometime after ca. A.D. 800, and recovered in Area A at this
site. It came from N801-W804, level 7. Another sherd of likely Caddo manufacture is a plain body sherd
with grog temper and a sandy paste. There is also a post-A.D. 1300 grog-tempered plain bowl sherd from
an ancestral Caddo elbow pipe.

Hoxie Bridge (41WM130)
Investigations by Bond (1978:137, 139) at the Hoxie Bridge site recovered one bone-tempered Caddo
pottery sherd with incised-punctated decorative elements along with plain sandy paste pottery (n=10)
and four sherds of Leon Plain. The Caddo sherd had curvilinear incised zones filled with rows of small
tool punctations that paralleled the incised lines, decorative elements consistent with Early Caddo period
utility wares such as Crockett Curvilinear Incised or Pennington Punctated-Incised.
The plain sandy paste sherds in the assemblage may be Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified sherds
from East Texas or upper Texas Coast Woodland period peoples (see Story 1990a). If they had been made
by Woodland period potters ancestral to the Caddo, the sandy paste sherds would date from ca. 500 B.C.
to A.D. 800. There are a few plain sandy paste sherds from other Central Texas sitesâincluding sites
in Bell, Hamilton, Hill, McLennan, and Williamsonâindicating that Woodland period ceramic ware
were obtained for use by Central Texas aboriginal inhabitants. Sandy paste sherds from two sites in the
Colorado River basin in nearby Bastrop County have been considered to be of Late Prehistoric age (see
Nickels et al. 2010:370), but no temporal evidence was offered from either site to support this assertion,
other than the assumption that sandy paste plain sherds date to within the Late Prehistoric period.

Loeve (41WM133)
One of the sherds in the TARL collections from
the Loeve site is a sandy paste Goose Creek Plain, var.
unspecified body sherd (INAA, UT00045); as previously
discussed, his sherd was made in Woodland period times
(ca. 500 B.C.-A.D. 800) in the southern parts of East
Texas and along the Texas Gulf Coast (see Story 1990a).
The other seven sherds in the collection are ancestral
Caddo wares that include plain grog-bone-tempered (n=2,
INAA, UT00044) and plain grog-tempered (n=1) sherds,
and four decorated bone or grog-tempered sherds. One
grog-tempered rim sherd is from a carinated bowl and
has diagonal and cross-hatched engraved lines (Figure
80). Another sherd is a bone-tempered body sherd with
parallel incised lines, while two other sherds (tempered
either with grog or bone) have cross-hatched incised lines
(INAA, UT00042), and may be from Canton Incised or
Maydelle Incised vessels.

41WM163
Excavations in Area A (N1001-W1004, level 4) at 41WM163 recovered five ancestral Caddo sherds.
This includes a plain grog-bone-tempered rim sherd, three plain grog-bone-tempered body sherds, and
one plain grog-tempered body sherd. The specific age of these sherds is not known, and it can only be
estimated that they date sometime after ca. A.D. 800, the beginning of the Formative Caddo period and
the beginning of the manufacture of ancestral Caddo tempered ceramic wares.

Loeve-Fox (41WM230)
There is a single plain grog-tempered and sandy paste body sherd from the Loeve-Fox site (Prewitt
1974:108 and Figure 23a), as well as a grog-tempered pipe bowl sherd (Prewitt 1974:108-109 and Figure
23b-c), not pieces of burned clay, likely from a long-stemmed Red River style pipe (see Hoffman 1967)
given its 21.0 mm orifice diameter. These pipes were made from ca. A.D. 800-1400 in the Caddo area.
The bowl is 7.1 mm thick.

Bigon-Kubala Site (41WM258)
The TARL ceramic collections from the Bigon-Kubala site primarily consist of bone-tempered Leon
Plain body and base sherds (n=159), but there are a number of grog and grog-bone-tempered Caddo
ceramic sherds in XU2 excavations. These consist of three decorated sherds and 35 plain rim and body
sherds. They are tempered with grog (n=24) and grog-bone (n=14). The decorated sherds include a body
sherd with a single straight incised line, another bod sherd with opposed incised lines, and a grog-bonetempered body sherd with a single tool punctate.
There are red-slipped sherds reported from the Bigon-Kubala site on the San Gabriel River (Hays
1982:8-230) that may be from Caddo ceramic vessels. The use of a red slip is a common feature in both
Middle and Late Caddo periods in sites on the Red River and the Sabine River in East Texas (see Perttula
2015a).

41WM267
An engraved Caddo sherd with an unknown decorative motif has been found at 41WM267 at Granger
Lake (Carey Weber, 2016 personal communication).

Rowe Valley (41WM437)
The Texas Archeological Society held Field Schools at the Rowe Valley site on the San Gabriel River
in the Brazos River basin in 1982-1984 (Prewitt 1982, 1983a, 1983b, 1984). Prewitt (2012:200; see also
Rush et al. 2015:113) notes that at least eight different Leon Plain bone-tempered pottery vessels have
been recovered in excavations at the Rowe Valley site in the ca. A.D. 1650-1700 occupational level at the
site (i.e., upper Toyah phase and Younger Age group), along with ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds.
These ceramic vessel sherds occur in four different clusters in the upper Toyah phase component (Prewitt
2012:Figure 9.4). Recent calibration of six related dates from the âYounger Age Groupâ range, however,
when combined in OxCal, from A.D. 1645-1664 (Rush et al. 2015:125 and Figure 10).
I recently had the opportunity to document and analyze the ceramic vessel sherds from the Rowe
Valley site. I first identified the technological and/or stylistic character of each of the vessel sections,
focusing on the temper, firing conditions, presence of organic residues, surface treatment, rim and lip

142ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
profile, and vessel wall thickness, along with the decorative methods (i.e., incised, brushed, etc.) and
decorative elements present on certain vessel sections. Here I also discuss the cultural affiliations of the
different vessels from the Rowe Valley site relying on technological and stylistic attributes and the results
of the instrumental neutron activation analysis of sherds from seven of the vessel sections (see Creel et
al. 2013; Perttula et al. 2003).
Vessel 1
Vessel 1 at the Rowe Valley site is a partially reconstructed brushed-punctated-appliqued jar (Figures
81 and 82a-c) of the Bullard Brushed type tempered with grog and small amounts of quartz sand. The jar
includes 102 sherds that are mainly conjoined into nine sherds that are part of the rim (Figure 82a), the
rim-body (Figure 82b), the lower rim-body (Figure 82c), and the vessel body sections. The rim ranges
between 6.3-7.9 mm in thickness, while the body walls range from 6.7-7.6 mm in thickness. The rim has
a direct profile and a rounded lip, with a 9.5 cm orifice diameter. The rim height is 6.2 cm, and the height
from the lower rim to the lower body is 13.3 cm in height. Its estimated volume is 1.1 liters.
The vessel rim has horizontal brushing marks along with a row of tool punctations below the lip
and at the rim-body juncture (see Figures 81 and 82a). Also on the rim are sets (probably four sets) of
two narrow vertical appliqued ridges that are 10 mm apart; the area between the appliqued ridges has no
brushing marks. The vessel body has horizontal and opposed brushing marks (see Figures 81 and 82b-c)
that likely extend to the vessel base.
This vessel has been smoothed on the interior surface, and there are fire clouds on both interior and
exterior surfaces; organic residue is present on the interior vessel surface. Core profiles indicate that
Vessel 1 was fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2f).

One sherd from the site (TKP155) was submitted for instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA)
and petrographic analysis (see Perttula et al. 2003) as part of an initial study of Caddo ceramics found on
Central Texas sites. Its chemical composition generally matches ancestral Caddo sherds from both north
and south of the Sabine River (see Perttula et al. 2003:Table 9). Creel et al. (2013:65) comment that the
sherd from this vessel âis more similar chemically to Caddo pottery and it is likely that the sample was
actually from a Caddo brushed vessel.â
Vessel 2
Vessel 2 is a Patton Engraved bowl (Figure 83) tempered with grog. Patton Engraved vessels
were manufactured after ca. A.D. 1680 by Caddo potters living in Hasinai Caddo communities in the
Neches-Angelina river basins. Patton Engraved is the primary engraved fine ware in historic Allen phase
components in the region (Perttula 2011, 2013).

Figure 83. Decorative elements on Patton Engraved vessel from the Rowe Valley site
(Vessel 2, 41WM437): a-b, rim sherds; c-f, body sherds.
This vessel is represented by 12 rim and body sherds; the rim is direct in profile, with a rounded and
slightly exterior folded lip; the orifice diameter is estimated at 7.0 cm. The rim sherds range from 4.95.1 mm in thickness, and the body sherds range from 4.7-6.3 mm. Both interior and exterior surfaces are
burnished, which is a common surface treatment on ancestral Caddo fine ware vessels, and the vessel was
fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2f).
The rim has upper and lower horizontal engraved lines with downward or upward-pointing excised
tick marks, as well as vertical to curvilinear lines connecting the upper and lower horizontal engraved
lines (see Figure 83a-b). The use of the vertical dividers on the rim panel suggests that Vessel 2 is a
Patton Engraved, var. Freeman vessel (Perttula 2011:Figure 6-66c), perhaps the earliest variety of Patton
Engraved. The vessel body has curvilinear engraved lines with excised tick marks (see Figure 83c-f), also
a feature of Patton Engraved, var. Freeman vessels.
One sherd from this vessel (TKP156) was submitted for INAA and petrographic analysis. The sherd
has been sourced to the Neches-Angelina river basin in East Texas, indicating it was manufactured
by an Allen phase potter in the Hasinai Caddo area of East Texas (Creel et al. 2013:65; Perttula et al.
2003:Table 9).
Vessel 3
This vessel is a plain and bone-tempered jar with riveted handles (Figure 84), possibly a Goliad
Plain jar made in 18th century contexts in mission sites in South Texas. Riveted handles are relatively
common in ceramic assemblages with Goliad Plain (Perttula et al. 2003:19). The vessel includes one rim
sherd (5.2 mm thick, and with a direct profile and rounded lip) with an 8.0 cm orifice diameter, two rim
sherds with riveted handles, 13 body sherds (5.1-5.6 mm thick), and two handle sherds. The interior and
exterior surfaces of the vessel have patches of smoothed to burnished areas. The handles are 10.7 mm in
width, 5.2 mm in thickness, and are at least 23.0 mm in length. The vessel has been fired in a reducing
environment and cooled in the open air (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2f).

Figure 84. Reconstructed vessel form for Vessel 3 at
the Rowe Valley site (41WM437), after Perttula et al.
(2003:Figure 6).
One sherd from Vessel 3 (TKP157) was submitted for INAA and petrographic analysis. These
indicate that the vessel was not made locally in Central Texas (Perttula et al. 2003:Table 9). Most of the
Goliad Plain samples in the Central Texas INAA database have been included in Group 10, from sites
along the Balcones Escarpment and the coastal plain (Creel et al. 2013:Figures 20-23). The Goliad Plain
sherd from the Rowe Valley site has been assigned to Group 10C (Creel et al. 2013:61 and Figure 23).
Vessel 4
Vessel 4 is represented by one rim sherd and eight body sherds of a plain bone-tempered vessel of the
Leon Plain type. The rim and body sherds are 6.2 mm in thickness, with interior and exterior smoothed
surfaces. The rim has a direct profile and a flat lip. The vessel was fired and cooled in a reducing
environment (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2b).
A sherd from this vessel (UT379) was included in the Creel et al. (2013) INAA study of Central
Texas ceramics. Compositional clusters of Leon Plain vessels fall in the Edwards Plateau of west central
Texas (Cluster A) as well as along the Balcones Escarpment (Cluster B). This sherd has been assigned to
Group 10 of Cluster B (Creel et al. 2013:Table 5), indicating a local manufacture of Vessel 4.
Vessel 5
Vessel 5 is a plain bone-tempered vessel with an exterior burnished surface and an interior smoothed
surface, likely a Leon Plain jar. The vessel section has six rim sherds and 33 body sherds, most that could
be conjoined. The rim has a direct profile with a rounded, interior beveled lip, and it has a 10.0 cm orifice
diameter. The rim sherds range from 6.3-6.4 mm in thickness, and the body sherds range from 6.0-6.7
mm thick. The vessel is plain and was fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air (see
Teltser 1993:Figure 2f, h).

146ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
One sherd from Vessel 5 (TKP158) was submitted for INAA and petrographic analysis. They indicate
that this vessel was manufactured from Central Texas clays, probably obtained near the Rowe Valley site.
Vessel 6
Vessel 6 is represented by five body sherds, four of which conjoin. They are from a plain bonetempered vessel, of the Leon Plain type, that was fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open
air (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2g). The interior and exterior surfaces of the sherds have been smoothed, and
body wall thickness ranges from 6.0-8.0 mm. A sherd from this vessel (UT386) was submitted for INAA,
and determined to have been made from Central Texas clays, likely from a clay source not far distant
from the Rowe Valley site.
Three plain body sherds included in the Vessel 6 bag appear to be from a separate vessel. The vessel
sherds are bone-tempered and have a sandy paste, and there is an organic residue on the interior surface
of each sherd. The sherds range in thickness from 5.4-6.3 mm, and they have been smoothed on both
interior and exterior surfaces. The sherds are from a vessel that was fired and cooled in a reducing or low
oxygen environment (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2b).
Vessel 7
The three body sherds from Vessel 7, a Leon Plain vessel, two of which conjoin, are plain and bonetempered. The sherds are 5.1 mm thick, and have been smoothed on their exterior surfaces. The vessel
was fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air (Teltser 1993:Figure 2f).
Vessel 8
There is one bone-tempered plain body sherd from Vessel 8, likely from a Leon Plain vessel. The
body sherd is only 3.3 mm in thickness, and there is no surface treatment. The sherd is from a vessel fired
and cooled in a reducing environment (Teltser 1993:Figure 2b).
Vessel 9
Vessel 9 includes 13 body sherds from a bone-tempered vessel with parallel to opposed brushing
marks; the sherds have been smoothed on the interior vessel surface. The body sherds range from 5.1-7.1
mm in thickness. This vessel was fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air (see Teltser
1993:Figure 2h).
A sherd (UT 380) from Vessel 9 was included in the Creel et al. (2013:65) INAA study of Central
Texas ceramics; it was considered to be an untyped brushed vessel. The INAA study indicates that this
vessel at the Rowe Valley site was made by potters using Group 10 clays. According to Creel et al.
(2013:60 and Figure 20), sherds from vessels made with these clays are âconcentrated in sites along the
Balcones Escarpment from the San Antonio area northeast to the greater Austin area but with members
scattered all through Central Texas and on the Gulf Coastal Plain.â
Vessel 10
There is one body sherd in the collection from this vessel at the Rowe Valley site. The body sherd,
4.9 mm thick, is from a grog-tempered vessel that was fired and cooled in a reducing environment (see
Teltser 1993:Figure 2b); it has been burnished on the exterior surface. The body sherd has parallel
engraved lines, and one of the lines has a possible excised tick mark, suggesting it may be from an
ancestral Caddo Patton Engraved vessel (see Vessel 2).

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ147
Vessel 11
Vessel 11 is represented by one plain lower rim-body sherd from a bone-hematite-tempered vessel,
likely Leon Plain. The body sherd is only 4.3 mm in thickness, and the exterior surface has been
smoothed and the interior surface has been burnished. The vessel was fired in a reducing environment
and cooled in the open air (Teltser 1993:Figure 2f).
In summary, analysis of the assemblage of ceramic vessel sherds from 11 separate vessel sections
recovered from the 17th century Toyah component at the Rowe Valley site (41WM437) during the
1982-1984 Texas Archeological Society Field Schools, indicates that the vessels were made in several
production locales in East Texas, Central Texas, and southern Texas.
The East Texas vessel sections include Patton Engraved vessels (Vessel 2 and Vessel 10) and a
Bullard Brushed jar (Vessel 1). These three vessels are grog-tempered. Prewitt (2012:200) suggests
that the Caddo vessels âare both generally associated with southern Caddo groups in the vicinity of
Nacogdoches.â In fact, however, Patton Engraved and Bullard Brushed vessels were made by Caddo
potters throughout much of the Neches-Angelina river basins in East Texas, particularly in the upper
Neches River basin (see Marceaux 2011). Patton Engraved vessels are generally considered to date
from after ca. A.D. 1650 in the Caddo area, or even later, beginning about A.D. 1680 and the start of
the Historic Caddo period (Perttula 2013). Vessel 2 is from a Patton Engraved, var. Freeman vessel, the
earliest Patton Engraved variety made in East Texas (Perttula 2011).
Vessels from the Rowe Valley site made of Central Texas clays are comprised of sherds from six
bone-tempered Leon Plain vessels (Vessels 4-8 and Vessel 11). The INAA of these sherds indicate that
they are compositionally similar to Group 10 clays (Creel et al. 2013:Figure 20). Vessel 9, a bonetempered brushed jar, is also considered by Creel et al. (2013) to have been manufactured with Central
Texas clays, but bone-tempered brushed jars are also common in post-A.D. 1400 contexts in the NechesAngelina river basin and the Sabine River basin (Perttula 2015a:Figure 11).
The last vessel in the assemblage is a bone-tempered Goliad Plain jar (Vessel 3) with riveted handles.
This vessel was likely made of coastal plain clays and is not local to the Rowe Valley site.

41WM763
Found at 41WM763 is a single ancestral Caddo ceramic sherd with one or more rows of fingernail
punctations (Figure 85). The sherd is from a utility ware jar

Unrecorded Site in Williamson County, Darrell Crain Sherd
Darrell Crain found an engraved Caddo sherd at an unrecorded archaeological site near the San
Gabriel River, a few miles east of Georgetown, Texas. Also found there was a Gahagan style biface
made from Edwards chert (John Haberer, February 2017 personal communication). The sherd is from a
grog-bone-tempered Early Caddo period Holly Fine Engraved bottle (Figure 86) with a carinated body
(cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 40e). The engraved design consists of a concentric arc or scroll band
of engraved lines below a small circle element; there is no clay pigment rubbed in the engraved lines.
The bottle had been fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air, burnished on its exterior
surface, and was 8.1 mm thick.

Summary and Synthesis
Through a combination of means, including examination of collections in curation facilities,
information provided by avocational archaeologists, and the review of published literature, ancestral
Caddo ceramics have been identified over a wide area of Central Texas as well as in parts of South Texas.
This report discusses the ancestral Caddo ceramics from 163 archaeological sites in 34 counties (see
Figure 2). The highest proportion of Central Texas sites with Caddo ceramics are in McLennan, Hill,
Coryell, and Williamson counties in Blackland Prairie and eastern Edwards Plateau natural regions, due
west from ancestral Caddo settlements in the southern part of the East Texas Pineywoods. Other such
sites are in the southern Edwards Plateau, the Llano Uplift, and the Rolling Plains, as well as the South
Texas Brush Country (i.e., a site in Dimmit County).
Twelve sites (7.4 percent of the overall regional sample, see Table 1) in Central Texas have small
amounts of plain sandy paste Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified pottery made and used by Mossy
Grove culture Woodland period peoples between ca. 500 B.C.-A.D. 800 (see Story 1990a; Ellis 2013).
These sites are concentrated in the Brazos River basin in Hill, McLennan, and Williamson counties
in the Blackland Prairie (Figure 87). The presence of this distinctive ceramic type indicates that there
were occasional contacts and the exchange of materials and information between Central Texas huntergatherers and Mossy Grove peoples to the south and southeast in the Post Oak Savannah, Pineywoods,
and probably the upper Texas Gulf Coast (Figure 88).
Creel et al. (2013:74-75) have noted that there are different distributions of Caddo manufactured
ceramic vessel sherds in Central Texas sites that have temporal significance. First, they commented
that Formative and Early Caddo period ceramics, dating from ca. A.D. 900-1200, are common âin the
area from the Brazos River valley around Waco south to the Georgetown area.â A total of 34 sites (20.9
percent of the overall site sample) in Central Texas have Formative to Early Caddo period ceramics from
plain, utility, and fine ware vessels (Figure 89). The majority of these sites, as Creel et al. (2013) have
noted, are in Coryell, Hill, McLennan, and Williamson sites, and these sites are distributed across the
Blackland Prairie and the eastern part of the Edwards Plateau. At least two of the sites, Chupik (41ML44)
and Asa Warner (41ML46) in the central Brazos River basin, have substantial assemblages of ancestral
Caddo ceramic vessel sherds (see Tables 44 and 47), perhaps suggesting more intensive settlement or
trade congregations at these two places, as well as some on-site manufacture of Caddo ceramic wares.
During the period from ca. A.D. 1200-1400, ancestral Caddo ceramics of Middle Caddo period
decorative styles occur primarily in Blackland Prairie sites (n=11, or 6.8 percent of the overall site
sample) in Bell, Bosque, Coryell, Hill, and McLennan counties in the Brazos and Colorado River basins
(Figure 90). One site (41TA123) in Taylor County in the Rolling Plains also has Middle Caddo period
ancestral Caddo ceramics.
Post-A.D. 1400 Caddo ceramics are much more widespread in Central Texas, and likely relate to
both Caddo bison hunting endeavors on the Southern Plains and in Central Texas as well as an intensified
period of exchange and interaction between Caddo groups and mobile Central Texas hunter-gatherers.
Creel et al. (2013:75, 77) comment that much of the post-A.D. 1400 Caddo ceramics (of the Late Caddo
and Historic Caddo periods) in Central Texas are:
considerably more common at sites along streams in the Blackland Prairie just below the
Balcones Escarpment, from about the Colorado River (maybe as far as the San Marcos River)
north to the Brazos River valley in the vicinity of Waco. Many of these sites have hundreds of
sherds representing many Caddo vessels, some Leon Plain and Boothe Brushed sherds, and in
some cases, even types from the Gulf Coast.

Figure 87. Distribution of sites with Mossy Grove culture Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified ceramics
in Central Texas sites.
Approximately 35 percent of the identified sites in Central Texas with ca. A.D. 1400-1680
ancestral Caddo ceramics have ceramics made by East Texas Caddo potters. They are certainly the
most widespread of the different Caddo ceramic assemblages (Figure 91) documented in Central Texas
sites, being concentrated in sites in Coryell, Hill, and McLennan counties in the Blackland Prairie and
eastern Edwards Plateau. Other nexuses of Late Caddo period ceramics in Central Texas are in Irion and
Tom Green counties in the Rolling Plains and western Edwards Plateau (Figure 91), showing a spatial
broadening of interaction and exchange networks.

152ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas

Figure 89. Distribution of sites with ca. A.D. 900-1200 ancestral Caddo ceramics in Central Texas sites.
The majority of the ancestral Caddo ceramics dating from ca. A.D. 1400-1680 were made by Caddo
potters in Frankston phase Caddo communities living on the upper and middle Neches River basin in East
Texas (Figure 92). This is one of the areas where Hasinai Caddo groups were living after ca. A.D. 1680.
Finally, post-A.D. 1680 ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds are identified on 15 different sites
(9.2 percent of the site sample) in Central Texas. These sites are particularly common in McLennan and
Hill counties on the Blackland Prairie in the Brazos River basin, where they are associated with historic
Wichita settlements (Figure 93). But other sites occur in the Llano Uplift, the Rolling Plains, and the
eastern Edwards Plateau. The ancestral Caddo ceramics of post-A.D. 1680 age came either from Caddo
settlements on the Red River, or more commonly from settlements in the Allen phase and Hasinai area of
the Neches River basin in East Texas (Figure 94; see Perttula 2017d).

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ153

Figure 90. Distribution of sites with ca. A.D. 1200-1400 ancestral Caddo ceramics in Central Texas sites.
By ca. A.D. 1680 East Texas Hasinai or Tejas Caddo and Red River Kadohadacho peoples had horses
and this likely led to an expansion of their interaction and exchange networks with non-Caddo peoples,
as well as their hunting territories (Barr 2011; Perttula 2017d:Figure 144), fostering the wide distribution
of ceramic wares among other goods. According to the Jumano Juan Sabeata in the 1680s, the Hasinai or
Tejas were âa settled people [who]â¦raised grain in such abundance that they even fed it to their horsesâ
(Bolton 1920:314). John (1975:169-170) has noted that âJumano traders had long bartered Pueblo textiles
and turquoise to Caddos, and Caddo bows in turn to Pueblos, as well as their own take of buffalo meat
and hides to both village peoplesâ¦On their western borders, Caddos held great summer trade fairs,
which attracted Jumanos and many other groups annually.â The Caddo were in regular contact with
aboriginal peoples living in Central Texas, the Southern Plains, and the Southwest, and the goods that
were being circulated included ceramic vessels, wood bows, lithic raw materials, and bison hides as well
as Spanish products such as horses, horse gear, ornaments, and clothing.

158ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Prairie Caddo Concept
The renewed interest in the meaning of the distribution of ancestral Caddo ceramic vessel sherds on
Central Texas sites dating after ca. A.D. 900 came from Shafer (2006) and his proposed Prairie Caddo
concept. Shafer (2006:5) has suggested that â[a]rguable prehistoric Caddoan [sic] groups occupied the
central Brazos valley and its tributaries by A.D. 1100 if not earlier, based on cross-dating artifact styles
from the George C. Davis siteâ¦Terminal dates are ca. A.D. 1250-1300, based on cross-dating and extant
datesâ from prehistoric sites in Central Texas. Shafer considers these groups the Prairie Caddo. He goes
on to hypothesize that the southern Prairie Caddo (i.e., the central Brazos and its tributaries) permanently
occupied âportions of the central Brazos valley with intermittent and interdigitated Caddo presence in the
peripheries to the west and southâ (Shafer 2006:7).
His hypothesis is that Caddo peoples occupied âthe Middle Brazos and its tributariesâespecially
the Leon and Bosque Rivers and their tributariesâ (Shafer 2006:1), and that these Caddo peoples (i.e.,
southern Prairie Caddo) had connections that were more than the product of trade and exchange with
the East Texas Caddo group that settled the George C. Davis site (41CE19) on the Neches River in the
East Texas Pineywoods around A.D. 800-900. Specifically, Shafer (2006:4) has argued that these prairie
peoples âwere affiliated with the George C. Davis site, and â¦that the George C. Davis site Caddo were
affiliated with the people of the prairie.â In this model, the George C. Davis site was a major regional
center between ca. A.D. 1000-1300 and âattracted visitors from adjacent and distant regions,â including
the Central Texas prairies, especially because of feasting events and ritual activities (Shafer 2006:9-10,
33). Shafer (2006:32) characterizes the site as a âgateway to the prairies.â
It has been further suggested by Shafer (2006:10) that Caddo ceramics made at the George C. Davis
site were moving or being exported to outlying settlements in the southern Prairie Caddo area. This
pottery was thought to have been obtained during feasting activities at the George C. Davis site, and then
apparently carried back to Central Texas and used âessentially for domestic rolesâ (Shafer 2006:26). He
also suggests that âthe absence of fine engraved pottery would be expected in small hunting camps,â
while larger villages on the Brazos and various tributaries would have a âvariety of vessels in both form
and decorationâ (Shafer 2006:10).
One of the important attributes in recognizing Prairie Caddo sites is Early Caddo period pottery,
obviously, but pottery that was produced by local Caddo groups on the prairie, and thus not representing
trade goods from Caddo peoples to Central Texas groups. As Shafer (2006:25) notes, most of the
Caddo pottery found on Central Texas sites is either grog- or bone-tempered, perhaps the product of
âtwo different technological stylesâ among Caddo potters. The pottery from the George C. Davis site is
primarily grog-tempered (see Newell and Krieger 1949), but bone-tempered Caddo pottery is common in
several areas in East Texas (see Perttula 2015a:Figure 11), most notably in the Angelina and mid-Sabine
River areas, but especially after ca. A.D. 1400.
While not found in great numbers, engraved sherds (as well as sherds with different decorative
methods) from vessels of apparent Caddo origin have been found at a number of sites in Central Texas
(see Watt 1953; Jelks 1962; Sorrow et al. 1967; Stephenson 1970; Ricklis and Collins 1994; Turner 1997;
Perttula et al. 2003; Shafer 2006), particularly sites ârestricted to the eastern margin of the Edwards
Plateau and the prairie environment immediately to the east and northeast of the plateauâ (Ricklis and
Collins 1994:305 and Figure 155). Creel et al. (2013:66) corroborate this distribution in their INAA
study of ceramics from Central Texas sites, noting that âessentially all Caddo pottery samples with
substantial probabilities of membership in a Central Texas compositional group (as well as in Caddo

Waco, Temple, and Belton (see Figures 89-91 and 93). These engraved wares, and other decorated wares,
are from contexts that in East Texas Caddo sites would date from Early Caddo (ca. A.D. 900-1200) to
Historic Caddo (ca. A.D. 1680-1800) times, but with an apparent peak in Caddo style engraved pottery
in Central Texas prairie sites dating before ca. A.D. 1300 (cf. Shafer 2006). My review of the 163 sites
in Central Texas that have Caddo ceramic vessel sherds indicate that engraved pottery is just as common
after ca. A.D. 1400 as it is before A.D. 1300, however.
Pottery on Central Texas sites is ânot nearly as common in prairie sites as they are in sites in the
Caddo heartlandâ (Shafer 2006:25), likely because of mobility and transportation constraints on these
Prairie Caddo groups, since they were relatively mobile hunter-gatherers. According to Shafer (2006:25):
Ceramics, while often used, played a far less significant role than in the sedentary sites in the
Caddo heartland. Jars were used for cooking and, when broken, were not replaced as they were
in the heartland. Bottles carried as canteens were broken in village and outlier sites, and likewise
not replaced. The general paucity of ceramics in Prairie Caddo sites is partly due to the fact that
there was no replacement rate for the imported styles. It remains to be demonstrated that locally
made ceramics replaced broken imported vessels.
What Shafer (2006:25) suggests is that âCaddo parties leaving Davis after ceremonial occasions [and
returning to the Central Texas prairies] brought pottery with them obtained through various mechanisms
of exchange and used the pottery essentially for domestic roles.â He further suggests that the analysis of
the ceramic assemblages from prairie Caddo sites should:
look for the presence of fine engraved pottery in central Texas collections. The absence of
fine engraved pottery would be expected. Central Texas sites are mostly small campsites that
were probably short-term hunting and gathering localities. Ceramics in such instances would
be for practical rather than presentational purposes. Jars that are either plain or with wet-paste
decorations for practical uses around the hearth would be expected (Shafer 2006:38).
This East Texas Caddo pottery found on Central Texas Prairie Caddo sites ought to be identifiable,
among various analyses, through a comparison of ceramic decorative motifs and elements from the
George C. Davis site to the Prairie Caddo sites, as well as through the instrumental neutron activation
analysis (INAA) and petrographic analysis of a sample of pottery sherds from the George C. Davis site
(see Descantes et al. 2005; Perttula 2017b) and ceramic sherds with Early Caddo period styles from
Prairie Caddo sites (see Shafer 2006:26).
Shafer (2006) has suggested that Prairie Caddo artifact assemblages dating before ca. A.D. 1200
(including Caddo style ceramics, large Gahagan bifaces, beaming tools, bone pins, and Alba-Bonham
arrow points) are most common in the area between the Brazos and Colorado rivers in Central Texas
counties; post-A.D. 1400 Caddo style ceramics are also found there. Boyd et al. (2014:133) comment
on how there must have existed social boundary maintenance practices and traditions between western
Caddo and eastern Edwards Plateau hunter-gatherer groups at different times, and to account for Caddo
pottery sherds in Central Texas areas they posit that (1) Caddo groups were present on the Blackland
Prairie for bison hunts; (2) Caddo groups were just one of a number of groups that encamped in this
area: (3) a defined boundary zone may have been present that was occasionally marked by interpersonal
violence. Carpenter et al. (2010:102, 106) posit the emergence of complex regional integration of
Caddo and non-Caddo Central Texas peoples after ca. A.D. 800 in response to both climatic and cultural
environmental changes.

160ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
More recently, Carpenter (2017; see also Carpenter et al. 2012:233-246, 255, 260-262) has argued
that post-A.D. 1250 Toyah phase sites and artifact assemblages âemerged from a Caddo material culture
in a small area on the Brazos Riverâ (Carpenter et al. 2012:233) and that âthe Toyah toolkit was likely
employed by the Caddo, Jumano, and Rockport peoples, among others, on a seasonal basis for shortterm, long-range territorial mobility when targeting high-ranked resourcesâ (Carpenter 2017:138). This
argument is hard to credit given the considerable differences that exist between Toyah ceramicsâplain
bone-tempered bowls, jars, and ollasâand ancestral Caddo ceramics of the same ages: grog, bone, and
hematite-tempered vessels of many forms and sizes, the majority of which have wet paste decorations
on utility ware vessels and engraved and slipped decorations on fine ware vessels, unless one accepts the
idea that Toyah pottery was used by Caddo potters for âad hoc purposesâ (Carpenter 2017:148), such
as grease rendering, and chose not to use their utility wares and fine wares for such purposes. A problem
with this argument is that ancestral Caddo utility and fine ware ceramic vessel sherds are present in these
same Toyah sites, where they obviously had been in use, but have been sourced to East Texas production
locales. If Caddo groups were bringing their ceramic vessels from their East Texas settlements, would not
they have been used as appropriate for tasks associated with bison hunting, procurement, and processing? A
more parsimonious argument is that Toyah and ancestral Caddo pottery were made by different peoples in
different locales, one likely of non-Caddo ethnic origin (Toyah pottery) and made locally in Central Texas,
and Caddo pottery made in East Texas settlements were used on Toyah sites like Leon Plain wares were.
Lastly, Carpenter (2017:151) asserts that there are connections between Caddo groups and Toyah
area sites because they share âbasic stylistic and technological traits, such as bone-tempered ceramics.â
While some ancestral Caddo pottery is commonly tempered with burned bone (Perttula 2015a:Figure 11),
as is Leon Plain in Toyah assemblages, there the similarities end. Typically, Toyah ceramics are more
than 95 percent bone-tempered, while Caddo assemblages when they are bone-tempered typically have
no more than 40-50 percent bone-tempered vessel sherds. But it is stylistically that Toyah and Caddo
ceramics are quite different: Toyah wares are plain wares (see Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012:12-13), while
ancestral Caddo wares have wet paste and dry paste decorations of considerable complexity and symbolic
meaning. It would not be easy to trace the evolution of Toyah ceramics from an ancestral Caddo ceramic
tradition that began more than 350 years before Toyah complexes even existed. However, it is considered
likely that Toyah folks gained knowledge about ceramic technology from ancestral Caddo populations,
and that the adoption of pottery, as among other hunter-gatherers (cf. Finley et al. 2017), may have
been the result of economic intensification associated with hot rock cooking and the procurement and
processing of bison hides and meat for more than 450 years (ca. A.D. 1250-1700).

Other Perspectives
Another possibility is that Caddo vessels manufactured in a number of different regions in East
Texas (see Perttula et al. 2003:Figure 16) were only very occasionally traded or exchanged for various
reasons (not just feasting) with aboriginal hunter-gatherer groups whose territorial range included the
Central Brazos river basin. These same hunter-gatherer groups, many affiliated with the Toyah phase,
did make their own pottery, likely inspired by Caddo pottery then in use (cf. Johnson 1994:242; Creel
et al. 2013:32), primarily a plain bone-tempered ware as well as probably a brushed-punctated utility
ware (Boothe Brushed) that closely resembles Bullard Brushed in character. On the basis of a stylistic,
petrographic, and chemical analysis of sherds from 11 Central Texas sites (Perttula et al. 2003:Figure 1),
Perttula et al. (2003:63) concluded that:
The generally low number of Caddoan [sic] pottery sherds found on many central Texas sites,
and the fact that the pottery was not made from central Texas clays, indicates that the sherds are
from vessels traded to local central Texas hunter-gatherers, not vessels produced by Caddoan
[sic] peoples who had settled in or were periodically using the central Texas region.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ161
Fields (2017:16-17) has suggested that the movement of Caddo pottery westward from East Texas
into Central Texas communities is associated with the eastward movement of arrow points and knives
manufactured from high quality Central Texas lithic raw materials, and that the âpattern of connection
between the eastern margin of central Texas and the eastern part of the state was a persistent one rooted
in long-held traditions.â These traditions are the product of interaction, exchange, and trade between nonCaddo and ethnically Caddo peoples, not between East Texas Caddo peoples and Prairie Caddo peoples.
Fields (2017:18) also points out that the benefits of trade between these different peoples was to help
establish cooperative alliances, and reduce competition and violence in the region, and that such alliances
were established and maintained by the Caddo over a long period of time, not just during the ca. A.D.
1100-1300 putative period of the Prairie Caddo:
Such alliances could have allowed the Caddo free rein for trips west of their homeland to hunt
bison, as well as to procure the coveted arrow tips and knife blades, and congregate with other
people for trade at certain locales near the Balcones Escarpment.
Two such likely places of group congregation in Central Texas, namely the Chupik (41ML44) and Asa
Warner (41ML46) sites (see Fields 2017:18), both have a relatively abundant assemblage of Caddo
ceramic vessel sherds that represent long-term use of these places. At Chupik, for example, the decorated
ceramics suggest use of the site primarily before ca. A.D. 1200, but there is evidence of post-A.D. 1200
use there, while at the Asa Warner site, the ceramics are primarily from a ca. A.D. 1200-1300 component,
but there is evidence in the decorated sherds for use at the site after ca. A.D. 1400 and after ca. A.D.
1680. Surely there are other trade congregation sites not yet identified in the sample of sites in Central
Texas discussed herein with ancestral Caddo ceramics.
Toyah phase sites with bison occur in a number of spatial clusters in Central and South Texas
(see Mauldin et al. 2012:Figure 5.1 and Table 5.2; Mauldin et al. 2010:Figure 8.6; Carpenter et al.
2012:Figure 13.8), particularly sites in the Brazos and Colorado River basins east of the Balcones
Escarpment and in the Edwards Plateau. Where the bison bone has been directly dated, the bison
dates to two periods, ca. A.D. 1300-1450 and A.D. 1630-1800 (Jon Lohse, February 2018 personal
communication). Ancestral Caddo vessel ceramics occur on a number of these Toyah sites, and as
previously noted, most of the ceramics on these sites date after ca. A.D. 1400. It seems likely that
the occurrence of post-A.D. 1400 Caddo ceramics on Central Texas sites represent material evidence
of the interaction, exchange, and trade between certain Central Texas hunter-gatherers and Caddo
farmers that were engaged in bison hunting and/or trade for meat, hides, and bone tools on the Central
Texas landscape. Bison hunting provided different aboriginal populations in East and Central Texas a
considerable opportunity for interaction, exchange, and trade of other goods (such as ceramic vessels
made by East Texas Caddo potters) through the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, if not beyond.
In East Texas Caddo sites with bison (n=24), bison remains are much more common in Caddo sites in
East Texas dating after ca. A.D. 1430 (see Perttula 2015c:Table 1). Five sites (21 percent), were occupied
between ca. A.D. 1430-1550, and another four sites (17 percent) were occupied between ca. A.D.
1550-1690. One other Late Caddo site in East Texas with bison has only broader temporal estimates,
unfortunately: being occupied between ca. A.D. 1430-1680. This period is also the time when Caddo
pottery is more common in areas of Central and East Central Texas where Caddo groups were hunting
bison (Creel et al. 2013:74). In the historic Caddo period, four of the East Texas sites with bison bones
(17 percent) were occupied between ca. A.D. 1680-1750. The last of the known Caddo sites in East Texas
with bison bones was occupied between ca. A.D. 1750-1775.

162ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Historic records concerning the Caddo exploitation of bison are illuminating as various Spanish
accounts indicate that from the 1690s to the mid-18th centuries, if not earlier as well as later, East Texas
Caddo groups had been hunting bison herds between the Trinity and Colorado rivers in prairie habitats
(Foster 1995:40, 112). Fray Casanas, who lived among the Hasinai Caddo groups in East Texas in
1690, noted that the Caddo men traveled west (in the Brazos and Colorado River basins) to hunt bison
(Casanas 1968:44; Creel et al. 2013:75). Sites with Historic Caddo ceramic vessel sherds are present in
both river basins (see Figure 93). The cooler and wetter climates at that time period created vegetation
conditions âsufficient to sustain sizeable herds of the large animalsâ (Foster 1995:236). In 1768, Solis
noted that bison herds were not found east of the Trinity River. Earlier, Nasoni Caddo hunters from Red
River communities had taken 46 bison during a two-week hunt in 1719 north of the Red River in the
Kiamichi River valley in southeastern Oklahoma (Smith 1959:382). In later historic times among the
Kadohadacho, namely in the early 19th century (before 1830), bison were noted to occur in large herds in
the Bodcau Prairie in the Red River basin in Northwestern Louisiana (Webb 1959:10).

182ââThe Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas
Introduction
A Caddo ceramic vessel sherd from Williamson County, Texas, was submitted for petrographic
analysis by the senior author at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas
at Austin (TARL) in 2017. The sherd came from an unrecorded site on private property near the San
Gabriel River, and the avocational archaeologist that found the sherd brought the item to the attention
of archaeologists. This approximate find spot of the sherd was well more than one hundred miles from
the outskirts of conventionally delimited Caddo territory in Northeast Texas, and consequently the find
held immediate interest for archaeological researchers. Analysis of the decorative elements on the sherd
by Perttula identified the sherd as coming from an Early Caddo period (ca. A.D. 900-1200) Holly Fine
Engraved ceramic vessel (Suhm and Jelks 1962:76-79) (see Figure 85, this volume). Further detailed
analysis of the sherd could possibly indicate source areas in Caddo country or the alternative situation
of local production of a ceramic vessel that closely resembles a Caddo vessel. The implications of the
findings either way will illuminate issues of trade and transport of material culture items within and
outside of the Caddo area of Northeast Texas.

Geological Background
Deposits along the San Gabriel River near the site are Quaternary in age, along with some Tertiary
alluvial materials derived from the Cretaceous rock outcrops to either side and upstream on the river.
Nearby lie the consolidated rocks of the Cretaceous Navarro Group. These rocks are largely undivided
members of the Upper Taylor Marl and the Lower Taylor Marl, consisting of dense calcite deposits with
abundant montmorillonitic clays and widely distributed rounded silt-sized quartz and rare glauconite,
phosphate, pyrite, and hematite particles. Upstream, the widespread Cretaceous Austin Chalk has dense
micro-granular calcite deposits with marine shell fossils, bentonite seams, and common pyrite nodules
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1981).

Methods
Megascopic Analysis
Megascopic analysis is close examination of an artifact to identify relevant technical and cultural
variables manifest in the artifact. In this case, the analysis relied on observation of the object with a
stereoscopic binocular microscope in magnifications up to 10 power (10X). Colors were recorded by use
of Munsell Color Charts.

Petrographic Analysis
The petrographic analysis applied the near-standard method of point counting 200 bodies or species
in a thin section of the sherd prepared by National Petrographic Inc. of Houston (Chayes 1949; Shepard
1942, 1976). Point counting gives an accurate picture of the proportions of all the rocks, minerals,
and voids in the section, as well as baseline information about the ceramic matrix of the vessel. The
microscope work was conducted on an Olympus OH2 stereographic petrographic microscope at TARL.

Results
The megascopic analysis recorded variables of color, texture, and forms of decoration on the original
sherd and vessel (Table A-1). The exterior surface is well burnished following the engraving of the design

on the bottle sherd. The interior surface is roughened. Patches of grayish carbonate scale or caliche
coating obscure parts of the sherdâs interior surface.

The sherd core is taken up by a wide carbon streak. The paste texture is rough to slightly rolling. The
paste also has a very fine silt component, likely resident in the original clay. Additional particles include
medium sand-sized angular gray and black bodies, probably pieces of grog temper. There are also white,
red, and black sub-rounded particles that may be additional tempering (bone particles). Altogether the
matrix and the aplastic inclusions look strongly like Caddo ceramic pastes found on sites in Northeast
Texas.
The petrographic analysis even more closely aligns the sherd with Caddo ceramics (Table A-2). The
paste is moderately silty with rounded to very angular quartz silt, and it is tempered with bone and grog.
The grog itself is tempered with quartz temper, with the exception of one particle that also contains a
fine sand-sized particle of bone. Bone temper, the white particles identified in the megascopic analysis,
ranges in size from medium sand to very coarse sand, and its colors under plane-polarized light are blue,
turquoise, and brown. Minor minerals include common quartz, composite quartz, felsite (i.e., a generic
term for many types of light-colored felsic fine-grained rock), and iron stain. This last body is a class of
iron oxide, technically a soft form of hematite, that appears in the section as rounded, small, fine sand
masses with blurry, indistinct edges, that give the material the look of a dye stain on the paste. Two voids
had organic material in them, but they lacked dark rims around the voids. Mica, a very common regionwide marker for some Caddo pottery, is lacking in the section. Feldspar, an occasional telltale mineral, is
also absent from the section.

Distributional Analysis
The sherd and its contents contrast strongly with the carbonate landscape and substrate geology on which
it was found. The sherd lacked any carbonate minerals or rocks in its interior; the interior surface carbonate
scale is a post-depositional addition as would be expected on a calcium-rich, caliche-producing landscape. The
search for a locality of origin of the specimen must look outside the Williamson County region.
The most distinctive direct finding of the ceramic petrographic analysis is the combination of bone
and grog temper. These co-tempers are not uniformly distributed across prehistoric ceramic assemblages
in Texas. Crushed bone was used as a temper in the Caddo area, the prairie zone of North and Central
Texas, and in West and Southwest Texas vessels. Grog temper (i.e., crushed sherds) was used commonly
in the Caddo area, but not in the prairies or the Central, West, and Southwest regions of Texas. Typically,
the finding of a grog-tempered ceramic in any of those areas is sufficient to define the sherd as being
from a Caddo-manufactured vessel. Currently, wares routinely tempered with grog are not known in the
western half of Texas. The combination of grog and bone temper is a rare combination, with intermittent
distributions only in the Caddo area. It is not known definitively if grog temper and grog and bone
temper are strictly non-native ceramic traits of prairie and western Texas peoples, but a few recent studies
have brought forward some archaeological evidence that may be of use in determining this.
In a comparative study of 118 Leon Plain ware (western) sherds and 68 Caddo sherds, all studied
by the petrographic method, Lori Barkwill-Love (2012:Table F4) reported a complete absence of grogtempered western sherds, but abundant grog temper in the Caddo sherds, along with frequent occurrences
of bone/grog temper. Bone temper by itself was common in the western sherds.
In a smaller study of five sherds excavated from 41BQ285 on the North Bosque River in Bosque
County, Robinson (2010) identified grog temper in a sherd identified as of Caddo manufacture beforehand
because the sherd had an engraved decorative element. The other four sherds were western types similar
to Leon Plain. The Caddo sherd also had a greenish-gray paste and higher amounts of hematite than the
western sherds. The western sherds had prevailing red-brown paste colors and were tempered with varieties
of crushed quartz. Interestingly, none of the five studied sherds contained bone temper.

The Occurrence of East Texas Caddo Ceramic Vessel Sherds in Central Texas ââ185
Iruegas (Perttula et al. 2003:23-31) conducted a petrographic analysis of 27 identified Caddo sherds
collected from sites distributed across four Central Texas counties, all located southeast of Bosque
County. Grog tempering was definitive of some of his paste groups, and organic materials including bone
were common in the collection; presumably some of the bone was deliberate temper. The study was not
comparative, focusing on Caddo sherds from Central Texas sites, and western, Leon Plain ceramics, were
not examined.
Bone and grog temper are found as co-tempers in some sub-areas of the Caddo area of Northeast
Texas, but not in others. Sites with considerable proportions of grog-bone temper are found in Smith,
Rusk, Titus, Franklin, Panola, San Augustine, Delta, Marion, Harrison, Camp, and Nacogdoches
counties, among others. With regard to bone temper alone, however, the use of burned animal bone for
the temper of ceramic vessels is a distinctive characteristic of some Northeast Texas Caddo ceramic sherd
assemblages, and most ceramic assemblages in the region have some bone-tempered sherds. However,
sherd assemblages with high proportions (>40 percent of the sherd assemblage) of bone temper are
concentrated in only a few locales across Northeast Texas, most notably in the Toledo Bend Reservoir
area along the middle Sabine River and in sites in the Angelina River basin. Bone-tempered sherds are
not a notable feature of Caddo ceramic assemblages in the Neches, Big Cypress, Sulphur, or Red River
basins (Perttula 2015).
Pre-A.D. 1400/1450 Caddo sites with a high proportion of bone temper are found only in a few areas
in the middle Sabine River basin, including the Redwine site (41SM193). Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 14001680) sites and assemblages with high proportions of bone temper are found in one site in the Trinity
River basin (41HE70, Story 1965), and in several sites in the mid-Sabine and Angelina River basins. In
fact, these sites are part of a previously identified Late Caddo period bone-tempered and brushed ceramic
tradition (Perttula 2011:Figure 6-71 and 2015:Figure 11). Historic Caddo sites (dating from ca. A.D.
1700-1830) with high percentages of bone temper use are known only in the upper and middle Sabine
River basins, and in the lower Angelina River basin (Perttula 2015).
The combined megascopic and petrographic analysis reported here establishes the Williamson
County sherd clearly as deriving from a Caddo ceramic vessel and not from a vessel of local Central
Texas manufacture. However, a more precise determination of its point of origin in the Caddo area of
East Texas awaits further research.
