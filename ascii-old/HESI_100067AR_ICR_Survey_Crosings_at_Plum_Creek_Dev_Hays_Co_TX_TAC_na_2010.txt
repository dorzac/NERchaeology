MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 27 July 2010, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas
within the proposed 103.0-acre Crossings at Plum Creek development located just north of Kyle
in Hays County, Texas (Project Area). Although the proposed development is located on
private property and is privately funded, impacts to areas under the jurisdiction of the USACE
will require the usage of Nationwide Permit (NWP) 29 issued by the USACE in compliance with
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1976. As NWP 29 is a federal permit, the areas within
the purview of the USACE also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. On behalf of Forefront Builders Corporation of
Texas (FBCT), Horizon conducted the intensive cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas in compliance with the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose
of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located within the USACE
jurisdictional areas, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP).
In all, the investigated USACE jurisdictional areas total
approximately 62.0 acres.
The survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed development resulted
in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of any of the
USACE jurisdictional areas or within any of the 31 excavated shovel tests. In general, the
USACE jurisdictional areas contained shallow clay soils with a decreased potential to contain
subsurface cultural deposits.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas within the proposed development, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed
Crossing at Plum Creek development will have no impact on significant cultural resources within
the USACE jurisdictional areas and that no further investigations are warranted at these
locations. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the
undertaking.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas within the proposed 103.0-acre
Crossings at Plum Creek development located just north of Kyle in Hays County, Texas (Project
Area; Figures 1 through 3). Although the proposed development is located on private property
and is privately funded, impacts to areas under the jurisdiction of the USACE will require the
usage of Nationwide Permit (NWP) 29 issued by the USACE in compliance with Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act of 1976. As NWP 29 is a federal permit, the areas within the purview of the
USACE also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. On behalf of Forefront Builders Corporation of Texas (FBCT),
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the intensive cultural resources
survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas in compliance with the regulations of Section 106 of
the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located
within the USACE jurisdictional areas, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In all, the investigated USACE jurisdictional areas
total approximately 62.0 acres.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal
Investigator for the project, while Michael Mudd conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed
development on 27 July 2010. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel
testing efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas. The Texas State Minimum Archeological
Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres on projects
between 11 and 100 acres in size. As such, a total of 31 shovel tests were necessary within the
62.0 acres comprising the USACE jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the TSMASS.
Horizon met these minimum survey standards by conducting 31 shovel tests within the USACE
jurisdictional areas.

The survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed development resulted
in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of any of the
USACE jurisdictional areas or within any of the 31 excavated shovel tests. In general, the
USACE jurisdictional areas contained shallow clay soils with a decreased potential to contain
subsurface cultural deposits. These soils would have likely confined any cultural materials to
shallow or surface contexts, and would not have facilitated deeply buried, stratified deposits.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas within the proposed Crossings at Plum Creek development, as well as the
low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits within the jurisdictional areas, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the proposed Crossings at Plum Creek development will have no impact
on significant cultural resources within the USACE jurisdictional areas and that no further
investigations are warranted at these locations. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

2.1

General Project Area Description

The Project Area consists of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed
Crossings at Plum Creek development (see Figures 1 and 2). The proposed development is
located just north of Kyle, Texas, and can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’
Buda, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 2). Overall, the proposed development totals
approximately 103.0 acres of cleared pastureland. The USACE jurisdictional areas are
considered to be those areas within 300.0 feet (91.4 meters [m]) of Plum Creek and 1 of its
tributaries that extends across the property.
These USACE jurisdictional areas total
approximately 62.0 acres. Photographs of the USACE jurisdictional areas are presented in
Figures 4 through 7.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed Crossings at Plum Creek development is located just north of Kyle in
eastern Hays County, Texas. The property consists of relatively flat pastureland, with
elevations ranging between approximately 690 and 710 feet above mean sea level.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Guadalupe River basin. The property is
drained to the east by Plum Creek and 1 of its tributaries. Plum Creek flows to the southeast
and converges with the San Marcos River southeast of Luling, Texas. The San Marcos River
eventually joins the Guadalupe River a considerable distance southeast of the Project Area near
Gonzales, Texas.

2.3

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The Project Area is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age, sedimentary rock
strata; specifically, the project area is underlain by Late Pleistocene Fluviatile terrace deposits
(Qt), which consist of gravel sand, silt, and clay (Barnes 1981). Specifically, the project area is
situated on the Lewisville-Gruene-Krum soil association (Batte 1984). The Lewisville-GrueneKrum Association is composed of shallow to deep, gently sloping soils over loamy, clayey and
gravelly sediments on stream terraces and valley fills in the Blackland Prairie and Edwards
Plateau physiographic regions. The parent material of in situ soils in the vicinity of the project
area is the indurated limestone bedrock that underlies the region. Closer to the major rivers,
soils formed over alluvium of recent and Pleistocene age, but no substantial alluvial deposits are
present in the vicinity of the project area.

While aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial
sediments adjacent to major streams in Central Texas, the relative antiquity of the preHolocene-age terraces in the Project Area suggests that any cultural resources would be
constrained to the modern ground surface, rather than in buried contexts, in erosional settings
lacking integrity. Intact, buried archeological deposits may occur within alluvial sediments near
major streams, though no deep Holocene-age alluvial sediments are mapped within the current
project area. The terrain within the project area consists of a Pleistocene-age marly clay terrace
situated above the more recent Holocene-age terraces of the Blanco River. Erosion has been
relatively extensive within the project area, and very little Holocene-age sediment remains on
the surface of the terrace structure. No deep alluvial sediments with the potential to contain
buried, intact archeological deposits are mapped within the Project Area. Other things being
equal, any cultural resources associated with the soils mapped in the Project Area would be
expected to occur on the modern ground surface in deflated, eroded contexts that would lack
stratigraphic integrity.

2.4

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Hays County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 cm (32 in) and temperature
averages 19°Celsius (C) (67°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the
warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier
periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to
25 in), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall.
Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an 18-hour period
in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge that fell in less

than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of
winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for
moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over
meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather
than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region, and
rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.5

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943).
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The
boundary, characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian
provinces passes through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in
the Texan province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite
(1948) as a C2 (moist subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this
soil type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas
include the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies. Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat
and bog marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana),
hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), blacktailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the
Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—
occur in the Texan.

Crossings at Plum Creek Development in Hays County, Texas

Sixteen species of lizards, including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found,
including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis)
(grassland species), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard
(Sceloporus olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink
(Eumeces obsoletus) (forest species). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this
area, including small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander
(Ambystoma tigrinum), and eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts
as a barrier to urodele distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west
and the Austroriparian fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the
Texan into the Austroriparian province include Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s
chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water
snake (Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early
historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of
North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly
through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late

HJN 100067 AR

21

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The

first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement
of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished.
During the Spanish period, the region lay at the edge of the main route from San Antonio
to East Texas, the Old San Antonio Road 1 . In 1691, Domingo Terán de los Ríos crossed the
southern edge of the county on his way to the East Texas missions and the Red River. The
Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition explored the upper San Marcos River in 1709, and Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis was attacked by Apaches in 1714 at the San Marcos River crossing. A
mission to be called San Marcos was authorized in 1729 near the site of present San Marcos,
but the authorization was later rescinded in favor of San Antonio. San Xavier Mission and San
Francisco Xavier Presidio were located briefly at the site in 1755-56, but no permanent
settlement was attempted until 1807, when some 80 persons were moved to the Old San
Antonio Road crossing of the San Marcos River. San Marcos de Neve, 1 of a chain of defense
settlements, was abandoned 4 years later, after flooding and attacks by Comanche and
Tonkawa Indians. To encourage settlement after the Mexican War for Independence, the
government of Coahuila and Texas issued land grants in the county to Juan Martín Veramendi
in 1831, Juan Vicente Campos in 1832, and Thomas Jefferson Chambers in 1834. The first
Anglo-American settler in Hays County, Thomas G. McGehee, was issued a league of land in
1835 by the Mexican government and was farming north of the site of present San Marcos in
1846.
On 1 March 1848, the state legislature formed Hays County from territory formerly part
of Travis County. William W. Moon, Eli T. Merriman, and Mike Sessom, original settlers and
members of John Coffee Hays’ company of Texas Rangers, worked with General Edward
Burleson, a member of the Texas Senate, to have the new county named for Hays. County
organization and the designation of San Marcos as the county seat gave impetus to settlement;
the population grew from 387 in 1850 to 2,126 in 1860. The county shrank slightly on
12 February 1858, when it lost acreage to the new Blanco County and gained a portion of
Comal County. On 10 January 1862, the legislature again transferred another small area to
Blanco County. Boundaries remained stable for nearly a century, until resurvey of the HaysTravis county line in 1955 added more than 16,000 acres to Hays County.
A stage line from Austin to San Antonio crossed the county in 1848, the year that
Edward Burleson built the first sawmill. W.A. Thompson built the first cotton gin in the early
1850s, and, between 1855 and 1885, Ezekiel Nance built and operated 5 gins, 5 gristmills, a
sawmill, a shingle mill, and a beef packery. Alfred B.F. Kerr organized the first church in Hays

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

County in 1847, and a school was built at San Marcos in 1849. Another school was opened at
Snake Lake in 1851, and John D. Pitts built a school in Stringtown before 1860. The Johnson
Institute, founded in 1852 by Thomas Jefferson Johnson, drew students from a large area of
Central Texas until it closed in 1872.
The early settlers of Hays County were a mix of old Texans and Georgia and Arkansas
immigrants. With the coming of the Civil War, most of the residents favored secession. Colonel
Peter C. Woods’ 36th Texas Cavalry regiment was organized at Camp Clark, in neighboring
Guadalupe County, in 1862; Company A was primarily made up of Hays County men. During
the war, county beef helped to feed Confederate forces. Shortly after the war’s end, Colonel
George F. Snyder, a Georgian, established the first newspaper in Hays County, the Pioneer.
During Reconstruction, a Ku Klux Klan group was formed, and, in May 1876, a military
organization, the San Marcos Greys, was formed.
George Neill drove the first herd of cattle from Hays County to Kansas in 1867, and
other drives followed. Farming also became more profitable in the eastern part of the county
and helped encourage a fresh influx of settlers. By 1878, the county was out of debt, several
new communities had been organized, and schools had grown in number to match the
increased population. The Coronal Institute was founded in 1866 followed by the San Marcos
public school system in 1870. Southwest Texas Normal School was authorized at the turn of
the century and opened in 1903 as a teacher-training institution; it became Southwest Texas
State University in 1969. San Marcos Baptist Academy was established in 1907.
In 1880, the first Hays County rail line, built by the International-Great Northern Railroad,
was completed to San Marcos from Austin; it later extended to San Antonio. Another population
boom followed the railroad. The county population nearly doubled, from 7,555 in 1880 to
14,142 in 1900, and then remained virtually unchanged for the next 50 years despite the
influences of World War I and the depression of the 1930s. Even the economic stimulus of
World War II had only momentary effect. Hays County remained predominantly agricultural;
almost 90% of the mid-1960s farm income came from livestock. Not until the establishment of
the Gary Job Corps Training Center on the site of the former Gary Air Force Base in 1964 and
the growth of enrollment at the university in San Marcos did Hays County begin a period of
steady growth—from 19,934 in 1960 to 27,642 in 1970; 40,594 in 1980; and 65,614 in 1990.
Although agriculture remained significant in county economics, nonagricultural income, primarily
at the educational and training facilities, played an even larger role. The 1979 per capita
income of $6,009, however, remained well below the state average of $8,778.
Since early in the century, Hays County has enjoyed a steady influx of tourists attracted
by the caves, springs, and spas of Wimberley and San Marcos. Aquarena Springs and Wonder
Caves are particularly well known. Camp Ben McCulloch, near Driftwood, was organized in
1896 as a site for reunions of the United Confederate Veterans; their descendents continue the
annual tradition. More recently, the county caught the attention of environmentalists. Ezell
Cave, a watery cavern in San Marcos, is the habitat of several rare animal species, including
the Texas blind salamander, and 6 of the 10 known varieties of aquatic cave fauna are found
only in this cave and its underground waters. The only known habitat of the San Marcos
salamander is San Marcos Springs, and 2 other unique fish of the springs, the fountain darter

and San Marcos gambusia, were classed as endangered in 1990. Also on the endangered list
is Texas wild rice, which is not known to exist outside a small area near the springs.
During the 1970s and 1980s, growth in the northern and eastern parts of the county was
influenced by the expanding Austin metropolitan area and the Austin-San Antonio urban strip
along Interstate Highway 35. In 1973, Hays County became part of the Austin Metropolitan
Statistical Area. In addition to the county seat, San Marcos, which had a population of 28,743 in
1990, other county population centers are Wimberley (2,403), Kyle (2,225), Buda (1,795),
Dripping Springs (1,033), and Hays (252).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

In order to determine if any previously recorded archeological sites, historic structures,
or cemeteries were documented within or adjacent to any of the USACE jurisdictional areas
contained within the Crossing at Plum Creek development, Horizon conducted archival research
via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas web site (THC 2010). This review
indicated the presence of 1 previously recorded archeological site and 3 properties listed on the
NRHP within a 1.0-mile (1.2-km) perimeter of the Project Area (Table 2; Figure 8). No
previously recorded archeological sites or cemeteries, including any listed on the NRHP or
formally designated as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), are located within or
immediately adjacent to the Project Area. Based on the Atlas, no formal cultural resources
surveys have been conducted within the boundaries of the Project Area.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas within the proposed Crossings at Plum Creek development on 27 July 2010.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within the
USACE jurisdictional areas. The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres on
projects between 11 and 100 acres in size. As such, a total of 31 shovel tests were necessary
within the 62.0 acres comprising the USACE jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon met these minimum survey standards by conducting 31 shovel tests within
the USACE jurisdictional areas.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate.
The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 9.
Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed Crossings at Plum
Creek development resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed
on the surface of the USACE jurisdictional areas or within any of the 31 excavated shovel tests.
In general, the USACE jurisdictional areas contained shallow clay soils with a decreased
potential to contain subsurface cultural deposits. These soils would have likely confined any
cultural materials to shallow or surface contexts, and would not have facilitated deeply buried,
stratified deposits.
It should be noted that there are 2 structures visible within the USACE jurisdictional
areas on the property on the relevant topographic quadrangle and aerial photograph (see
Figures 1 through 3). The northernmost structure appears to have once been a small
barn/animal pen based on its map symbol. At the time of the field survey, this structure had
been removed from the property and no evidence of its earlier presence was observed.
The second structure, located on the eastern property boundary just south of the
tributary of plum creek, was found to be a relatively modern structure (Figure 10; see also
Figures 1 through 3). A current resident on the property, Ms. Wynnette Barton, informed the
field crew that this structure was built by her father in the late 1960s or early 1970s to house
tenants who assisted with ranch work. Because of its later construction, this structure was not
documented as a historic-era archeological site.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas, as well as the low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits at
the majority of the jurisdictional areas, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed Crossings at
Plum Creek development will have no impact on significant cultural resources within the USACE
jurisdictional areas and that no further investigations are warranted at these locations. Horizon
therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.
