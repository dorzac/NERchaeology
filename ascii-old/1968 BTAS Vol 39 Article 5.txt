Excavations at a Midden Circle Site
In El Paso County, Texas
JOHN

W.

GREER

ABSTRACT
A Type TB midden circle dates to the early part of the Jornada Branch
period (A.D. 900). The occupation probably represents hunters and
gatherers of the Jumano tradition (Livermore Focus?) in contact with the
sedentary agricultural groups of the region.
INTRODUCTION
In December, 1963, I began a concentrated study of midden circles
and mescal pits with a trip, recording sites in many parts of western
Texas and southern New Mexico. During this time I was able to con
tact Vernon R. Brook of the El Paso Archaeological Society, who helped
a great deal by taking me to meet some of the members of the society
who knew of the existence of midden circles: John W. Green, John
Hedrick, Tom Martin, Chuck Koerner, Earl Wood, and others. One
person contacted at this time was Bill Kennedy (Antony, New Mex
ico), who gave the location of a midden circle just east of El Paso. The
site was visited and recorded by Brook, Koerner, and myself the next
day. At that time it was numbered TX-2 in accordance with the num
bering system for midden circle and mescal pit sites recorded by me
and was named the Pow Wow Site after a nearby arroyo of the same
name.
In December, 1965, I returned to El Paso and tested the site using
funds provided by the Department of Anthropology at the University
of Texas. During this time I resided with the Vernon Brook family,
and I would like to thank them for the many courtesies shown me
during both my trips.
LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION
The Pow Wow Site is located about 27 miles east of the center of
El Paso, one-fourth mile north of Highway U. S. 180 to Carlsbad, and
about six miles south of Hueco Tanks, the well known pictograph
area. It is just out of the western edge of the central Hueco Mountains
on a relatively flat desert region with occasional small limestone hills.
Pow Wow Arroyo, a large, dry wash, is approximately 300 yards
south of the site. Numerous natural tanks are shown on the topo

graphic map for the area and, no doubt, provided water for the early
inhabitants There is no water supply in the immediate vicinity of
the site however. The site occupies the eastern and northern slopes
of one of the low, rounded hills and stretches about 200 yards onto
the flat sandy area beyond, at an elevation of approximately 4400
feet above sea level. Vegetation on the site includes abundant lechu
guilla, spider cactus, creosote bushes, and prickly pear. There is no
sotol or any edible species of A gave in the immediate vicinity.
The site is composed of at least two midden circles, a number of
heat-fractured limestone hearths, and various occupation areas of con
centrated ash deposits and artifacts (Fig. 1). Midden #1 is a wellformed type TB midden circle (Greer, 1965: 44—45) with a maximum
outside diameter of 33—36 feet and an inside or pit diameter of 12—14
feet. The midden is on a very slight slope, with the upper side only
0.4 feet higher than the natural ground level and the lower side 2.1
feet higher. The central depression varies in depth below the rim of
the midden from a maximum of 0.3 feet. Tne hill slopes toward N
30° E, and the greatest deposits are on the downhill side of the midden,
which has a nearly level top. The main part of the midden rim is com
posed of fire-fractured limestone rocks (about 3 inches in diameter),
sand, and ash, while the central depression is almost purely a gray,
sandy ash.

Midden #2 is about 120 yards north of Midden #1 and may not
be a midden circle. It is so greatly eroded as to be simply a pile of
rocks and ash about 22 feet in diameter and 7 inches high.
Midden #3 is about 30 feet south of Midden #2 and is another circle
of burned rock, possibly a small midden circle 33 feet in diameter and
about 6 inches high. The very slightly depressed central area is about
11 feet in diameter and at most only 3 inches deep.
Midden #4 is a small, Type TB midden circle near the eastern edge
of ihe site and near a fence running almost north-south. The midden
is 22 feet in diameter and a maximum of 6 inches high. The pit is 11
feet in diameter, a maximum depth of 3 inches, and is composed al
most entirely of rock-free sand and gray ash.
Other concentrations of occupational debris occur in many areas
of the site. Most of the rock concentrations or hearths are about four
feet in diameter and 9 inches high. They are scattered around the
general area of the middens, especially between the hill and the fence
in the area of Midden #4. Most of the subsurface or living debris
seems to be primarily on the hill sides, such as a large area just above
and couthwest of Midden #1. These living areas are full of fire-cracked
limestone, ash concentrations, and a great deal of broken pottery and
flint and agate flakes. No rooms or other living structures were ob
served and are presumably absent from the site.
EXCAVATIONS
In 1965 the site was revisited for the purpose of testing the largest
midden circle (Midden #1) to determine its structure and cultural
affiliation, and obtain a carbon sample suitable for radiocarbon dating.
A trench 2.5 feet wide was laid across the midden, with one edge
lying along the axis of the midden through the center. The trench was
divided into 5 foot excavation units. Unit #4 was in the center of the
central depression and was the first excavated. All material from this
unit was screened through one-third inch hardware cloth and all arti
facts collezted. Because recent work at ring middens had discovered
a paucity of charcoal in sites of this type, at first all charcoal was col
lected. However, it soon became apparent that there was much more
charcoal than was needed, and only the larger pieces—those about
one-half inch or more in diameter—were kept. Pollen and soil samples
were also collected, but these have not been analyzed.
After Unit #4 was excavated into the sterile caliche underlying the
midden, Units #3 and #5 were excavated to complete a profile across
the central depression into the concentrated stones forming the ring.
The deposits from these two units were not screened.

The profile of the excavated trench is quite simple (Fig. 2). At the
surface there is a 3 inch layer of yellowish-tan, wind-blown sand
which covers most of the site. Below this, extending to the basal, coarse
sand, is a deposit of very fine and loose, light brownish-gray, sandy
ash. On either side of the central depression is a deposit of mediumlight to medium (compared to other midden circle sites) rock con
centration, which bulges slightly into the ash a few inches from the
bottom of the midden. This sloping of the concentrated rock is prob
ably due to the rocks falling back into the central area after they had
been piled up so high and does not seem to represent an intentionally
excavated pit into the ashy material.
ARTIFACTS
A tabulation of artifacts is given in Table 1. These include ones
collected during both visits to the site and those in the personal col
lections of Brook, Koerner, and Kennedy. Brook has in his possession
a Harrell point, an Olivella shell bead, and an Ensor point; Koerner
collected a small, obsidian thumbnail scraper; and Kennedy found
3 dart points and a drill near Midden #1 and two arrowpoints on the
midden. He also mentioned finding a large number of beads in the
occupation area just southwest of Midden #1.
Below are comments on the artifact classes and types present at the
site. Long, formal descriptions will not be given here, since most
classes are commonly described in archeological reports for other areas.
For most of the stone artifacts, see descriptions in Johnson (1964)
and other reports describing materials from Val Verde County. Pot
tery types are adequately described by Hawley (1936) and Lehmer
(1948).
Pottery (Fig. 3)
Alma Plain. This is similar to El Paso Browxi, but the sand temper
is much finer. The paste is an orangish-brown and the lip is burnished
to a dark reddish-brown. The rim is direct or slightly tapering to a
gently pointed lip.
Chupadero Black-on-white. These are olla body sherds with the
characteristic heavy striations on the inner surface. Broad and narrow
parallel black lines were pointed on a heavy white wash or a thin
watery slip as exterior decoration.
El Paso Brown. This plain brownware contains coarse sand temper
of large white grains which show through both interior and exterior
surfaces. The surfaces are generally orange to reddish-brown, but may

grade into gray, and the interior is often black. As previously men
tioned by Lehmer (1948: 94) some of the interior surfaces have stria
tions from smoothing with grass bundles. Firing clouds are common
on the exterior, and one sherd bears a mending hole. No rim sherds
were collected. An obvious characteristic of this type is the ease with
which the surfaces erode, leaving the temper even more prominent.
A worked sherd of El Paso Brown has relatively fine sand temper
and smooth surfaces. This is an olla body sherd and was used as a
scraper, possibly during the manufacture of other pottery, as is so
common throughout pottery-making regions. This small sherd is
23 mm. in diameter and 5 mm. thick.

El Paso Gouged. One jar body sherd has a coarse sand-tempered
paste and a floated surface covered with a red wash. Small gougedincised marks about 7 mm. long are arranged in horizontal rows on
the exterior surface. The prominent temper suggests a placement late
within the El Paso Ware (see discussion), and the surface treatment
is somewhat reminiscent of El Paso Polychrome (painted) and Playas
Red (both incised and gouged).
El Paso Polychrome. Five bowl sherds (three rim and two body)
and 11 olla sherds (1 rim and 10 body) were recovered. These pre

sumably appear fairly late within the El Paso Ware and are decorated
on olla exteriors and on both surfaces of bowls. The dominant attribute
of this type is the coarse, white sand temper which protrudes from the
paste, especially on olla interior surfaces. The rims are slightly
thickened-direct and the lips flat (Fig. 4). No flaring is present. The
bowl rim sherds (probably from the same vessel) bear mending holes.
Surface decorations include broad lines (ca. 6—13 mm. wide) of black
and fugitive red and additional solid areas in black. On whole vessels
which I have observed in various collections unpainted portions (pri
marily the lower parts of the ollas and the centers of the bowls) are
greatly floated and have a dark rust color, as opposed to the common
orange surfaces of El Paso Brown.
Playas Red. These sherds represent jars with quite hard paste con
taining finely ground sand temper. The exterior surface is finely
floated to a natural reddish-brown or a dark rusty-brown polish. The
surface may be either plain (simply floated) or slightly altered. Two
sherds appear to have been gouged (such as the El Paso Gouged sherd)
and then smoothed similarly to the Blind Indented utility ware of the
glaze periods around Santa Fe (Museum of New Mexico material
from the Cochiti area). Another sherd bears parallel, horizontal lines.
The general appearance is that these bands are the original coil boun
daries, which were not entirely smoothed, although the intervening
area (i.e. the coil body) is highly polished. Upon examination, it
appears that the surface was polished, then the bands were engraved
incised while the clay was still very slightly damp. No other incised
sherds were found.

Type undetermined. One rim sherd is probably related to Playas
Red. This slightly flaring, direct rim has a nearly flat lip and a highly
floated, light, reddish-brown exterior. The floated surface does not
appear dark enough for Playas Red. The brownish-gray paste is very
fine and contains fine sand temper.
Another jar body sherd has the exterior finely floated to a dark
gray. Although this surface is not the characteristic red of Playas, it is
probably related to that type. The paste is orange with fine sand
temper.
Beads
Olivella. One small, spire-looped shell bead was found by Brook on
the surface near Midden #1.
Cut shell. A very small, centrally drilled, circular bead of white
shell was found in the area just southwest of Midden #1. Kennedy
(pers. comm.) reported finding many beads in this area during his
digging.

Crinoid. Two light gray beads were made by breaking the casing of
marine
a
worn fossil (Vermetus?) into sections. These are 9 mm. in
diameter and the holes are 3 mm. in diameter. They were found in the
same area as the cut shell bead.
Arrowheads (Fig. 5, a-e)
Triangular. Two plain triangular arrowpoints were recovered. One,
made from a coarse brown material, is wide with straight, but crudely
serrated, blade edges. It is 28 mm. long and 25 mm. wide. The second
point, 23 mm. long and 14 mm. wide, is a narrow triangle with a
slightly concave base and is made of white flint. This point fits the de
scription of the Fresno type (Suhm et al., 1954: 498; Kelly, 1957: 46).
Harrell. A notched triangular point is tentatively identified as
Harrell (Suhm et al.. 1954; Suhm and Jelks, 1962). It may also be
classified as Toyah (Ibid.) or Piedras Triple-Notched (Kelley, 1957:
46), although it may be slightly different from these two types. The
point is triangular with a V-shaped base and sharp basal corners.
There is a notch on each lateral edge not far above the base and one
in the center of the base. The distal tip is broken, but the complete
point was probably 28 mm. long. It was found on the surface about
50 feet northeast of Midden #1.

#1. It has a long, parallel-sided blade with short, flaring barbs. The
stem is very slightly expanding and the base is rounded.
Although this point is considered here as representative of the Liver
more type as pictured by Suhm and others (1954: 502), it could belong

to a separate type altogether. This type is found over a great deal of
southern New Mexico and far western Texas. Work in midden circles
at Carlsbad Caverns National Park produced many such points. These
seem distinctive from the commonly mentioned Livermore points,
such as the one pictured by Lehmer (1948: p
. 7, f) and others
1
described by me (Greer, 1966c: 25—27). I have ‘also previously fol
lowed Kelly Smith’s (1963: 187) Brewster County work by including
contracting-stem points from New-Indian sites in Val Verde County
in the Perdiz-Livermore group, a combined type, again differing
slightly from the above styles. All of these points are different from
the classic, cross-shaped Livermore points found by Janes (1930) in
Jeff Davis County and described by Kelley (1957: 46) and Suhm and
others (1954: 502). The Livermore type, as it now stands, at least
should be divided into major varieties (e.g. contracting versus expand
ing stem, triangular versus cross-shaped outline) for descriptive com
parisons and eventually distributional studies.
Type Undetermined. This point also is in the Kennedy collection
from Midden #1. It is a small, thick arrowpoint, about 23 mm. long
and 14 mm. wide at the shoulders. The convex blade edges are notched
just above the square shoulders. The stem is contracting and the base
is slightly notched.
Dart Points
Ensor. In the Brook collection is a short, thick Ensor point (Fig. 5,
f) with wide, shallow lateral notches and a rounded base. The distal
tip is broken, but the estimated length is 40 mm. This point was found
near Midden #1.
Type Undetermined. Three points found by Kennedy have straight
to slightly expanding stems and convex bases (Fig. 5, g-i). The barbs
are strong to long, but not flaring. The blade edges are convex to
recurved, convex at the shoulders and concave at the distal tip. The
points range from 31 to 44mm. long.
Fragment. One distal fragment of a large dart point of white flint
had been ground smooth until the edges and point were rounded and
the flake scars barely visible. This specimen (when whole) probably
had religious significance, such as use in a medicine bag or for cere
monial functions. A. E. Dittert (pers. comm.) reports that at the
Pueblo town of Acoma in central New Mexico, dart points, identified
to types by their relative ages, are used by certain clan shamans during
such practices as curing rituals.

122

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Drill (Fig. 5, j)
A fairly thick drill was found by Kennedy on the surface of the
site. The base is small and rounded, and the blunt shaft is parallelsided with edges somewhat smoothed from use. The complete specimen
is 47 mm. long. This appears more like a late Archaic type (possibly
associated with the small dart points from the site) rather than Neo
Indian (pottery and arrowpoint associations), which is generally
characterized by small, finely chipped blades (Ray, 1935: 77; Jackson,
1938: 98; and others).
Graver (Fig. 5, k)
A single flint flake is unaltered except for the sharpening of two
small points by means of minute flaking. Such tools could have been
used for engraving or, more likely, tattooing (see Beals, 1932; Rueck
lug, 1955: 359;Kelley, 1955: 983).
Scraper
A small obsidian flake end scraper (“thumbnail scraper”) was
found by Koerner near Midden #1. It is circular, about 16 mm. in
diameter, and finely unifacially worked around two edges.
Knives (Fig. 5, l-m)
The knives are generally bifacial, widely lanceolate to ovate in
shape and crudely to sparsely chipped. They are made from fine
grained flint to fine quartzite-like material. Length ranges from about
35 to 55 mm.
Miscellaneous Worked Flint
Specimens in this group have one or more worked edges, but they
do not possess any unique descriptive qualities for comparisons with
other materials (such as scraper types). These artifacts are flakes,
sparsely and crudely flaked to serve as scrapers, knives, and possibly
other utilitarian tools.
Utilized Flakes
These small chert flakes have one or more edges with fine micro
flakes or use scars. They may have been used for cutting or scraping.
Blade-Flakes
These are elongated flint flakes, sometimes called “bladelets”. Their
length is greater than twice the width, and they range from 28 to 49
mm. long and 12 to 17 mm. wide. They bear no use marks and ob

1Z,3

viously represent flaking residue (many workers in Texas would
simply place blade-flakes with the rest of the unaltered flakes). I
include the separation of these objects as an aid to present research by
both myself and others.
Unaltered Flakes
Flint. Unaltered flint flakes are generally fairly small—under 40
mm. in diameter. The following flint (fine-grained chert) types are
present: black, bluish-black, all shades of gray, green and purple (same
stone), brown translucent, white, and pink. Flakes of pink-orange
agate were also found.
Limestone. These flakes are larger, usually over 50 mm. in diameter.
The specimens in this group range only from 50 to 65 mm. in maxi
mum dimension and up to 20 mm. thick. Specimens from other sites in
western Texas (Brewster, Jeff Davis, Hudsbeth, and El Paso counties)
and southern New Mexico (Eddy County) are often larger and much
more abundant.
Large Flint Tools
These are primarily core tools, probably used as small choppers or
scraping planes. There is one percussion-flaked edge on each, and two
specimens were additionally used as hammerstones. They are about
64 mm. in diameter and 23 to 49 mm. thick.
Limestone Tools (Figs. 6 and 7)
These are both core (or cobble) tools and large flake tools, probably
used primarily as choppers, scraping planes, crude saws, and large
knives. Each specimen has at least one crudely worked edge. There is
one unifacial chopper, three bifacial choppers, two bifacial knives
(“mescal knives”?) flaked along one long edge, and an elongated adz.
The last tool is very steeply beveled on one end, and the lower, ventral
planar surface is ground smooth, probably from use. These limestone
tools range in length from about 93 to 163 mm. The thicknesses and
shapes vary, as might be expected, due to the nature of the material.
Pebbles
Two small pebbles were found on the surface. One is limestone with
fine-grained green chert-like material at one end and a core of brown
flint. The second specimen is an obsidian pebble which appears to have
been battered somewhat. There is a burin-like chisel edge at one end
that may truly be a utilized burin. The coal-like opaqueness suggests
that this specimen is of local origin, as it seems that this type of

DISCUSSION
The Pow Wow Site apparently represents a multi-occupational area
dating within the time of the Jornada Branch of the Mogollon (see
Lehmer, 1948). The site is located on the desert flats barely out of the
central Hueco Mountains and at what appears to have been a favored
camping place. Midden #1 and the occupational deposits immediately
to the southwest of the midden probably represent the earliest occupa
tion as indicated by the dominance of El Paso Brown pottery. The
small, so-called dart points and the stemmed arrow-points are probably
products of this occupation. Middens #2 and #3 are apparently later
and account for nearly all of the El Paso Polychrome and Playas Red
and all of the Chupadero Black-on-white.
The dates from two carbon samples taken from Unit #4 seem quite
reasonable in light of pottery associations. The dates, released by the

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Radiocarbon Laboratory of the University of Texas (Valastro et aL,
1968), are A.D. 990±80 (Tx-363) and A.D. 840±60 (Tx-364). Al
though the dates from this split sample should have been identical,
they agree that the midden dates Ca. A.D. 900. This would also
strengthen the hypothesis that the midden dates before the introduc
tion of Chupadero Black-on-White (ca. A.D. 1050) and El Paso Poly
chrome (somewhat later).
In all likelihood the site was occupied by small groups of hunters
and gatherers like the Jumano, who spent much of their time in the
mountain areas hunting wild animals and gathering and roasting sotol
and/or agave (mescal). They were obviously in close contact with the
sedentary agriculturalists of the area as shown by the abundant pottery
in midden circle sites. Obsidian and western shell beads from the Gulf
of California were probably obtained via the Jornada Branch villages.
Whether the nomadic groups lived and traded with the local villages,
as Lehmer (1960: 126) points out from early sources, or raided the
villages in this desert-sand dune region and then returned to their
mountain country with the loot, is unknown.
The middens at the site, particularly middens #1 and #4, appeared
on the surface as Type TB midden circles (Greer, 1965: 44—45)—
mounded, circular accumulations of hearthstones with a wide, shallow
depression in the center. Excavation in the central area of Midden #1
confirmed its structure as a midden circle, as it lacked the subsurface
pit necessary for mescal pit middens (Greer, 1967).
At this point I would like to suggest a slight change in the nomen
clature for the middens in which I have been working. In 1963 I made
an extensive (though definitely not intensive) survey of sites conform
ing to the then common term “midden circle”. A typology of such
phenomena resulting from the survey and from voluminous corre
spondence was published two years later (Greer, 1965). At that time
(and subsequently) a midden circle was designated a specialized
accumulation of debris resulting from a surface hearth, while mescal
pits were evidence of a pit-cooking (earth oven) technique. Thus, the
variations in midden structure was thought to have cultural implica
tions (Greer, 1967).
Before these distinctions can be made, however, there is a necessity
for more field work in order to judge with some certainty the internal
structure of a burned rock midden from its surface characteristics.
Probably no one would ever confuse a deep, stone lined Type VA
roasting pit of the Casas Grandes style in Chihuahua, Mexico, with a
Type IA “midden circle” in the Guadalupe Mountains of southern
New Mexico. But, on the other hand, one would not be able to ascertain

The inadequacy of our present knowledge has led to the term “ring
midden” for the type of doughnut-shaped structure appearing as a
ring of mounded hearthstones, ash, or a combination of these surround
ing a depression of almost rock-free gray ash. “Ring midden” will be
used to signify a particular form with an unknown function. When
the function is ascertained through excavation (sub-surface pits are
occasionally, but rarely observable before excavation; the lack of a
stone-lined pit is never known), then the terms “midden circle” and
“mescal pit” can be used with some meaning and for the purpose of
cultural reconstruction. Eventually we should be able to predict sub

known as El Paso Brown. As time passed, the temper became more
prominent and the paste more friable. Surface decorations were added,
such as the application of a red wash and gouging (probably a crude
copy of Playas Red and Playas Incised) or even painting with either
red or black lines on the brown surface (likely the influence from the
Chihuahuan and Hohokam areas). Eventually the ware came to be
realized as vessels with a highly floated (though not attaining a polish)
surface with polychrome designs in black and fugitive red.
Following a suggestion by the El Paso Archaeological Society (n. d.)
I am proposing that the present El Paso Brown be divided into El Paso
Brown (with relative age, designated by the abundance of tempering
material, duly noted in any descriptions, e.g. El Paso Brown, varieties
fine and coarse), El Paso Gouged, El Paso Punched (see Lehmer.
1948: 94), El Paso Black-on-brown, and El Paso Red-on-brown. Next
would be El Paso Polychrome. These types could be put into a unit
designated El Paso Ware or, if one preferred, the El Paso Series, origi
nating from a single cultural group in duration over a moderate length
of time and important enough to show their influence in such distant
areas as the northern part of the Texas Panhandle (Watts, 1963).
Another problem in the archeology of the West Texas area is the
relationship of the small, side-notched dart points to the arrowpoints.
Such is the case at the Pow Wow Site, where one Ensor point and 3
small points similar to Guadalupe points (Greer, 1966c: 30) were
found on the site with abundant El Paso Ware and a few arrowpoints
(Livermore, Harrell, and Fresno). It seems that these small dart points
occur on every midden circle site thus far examined, including all
apparently single occupation Neo-Indian sites. Such occurrences sug
gest that the dart points and the arrowpoints were in part contempor
aneous and in direct association (e.g. Greer, ms). Dibble (1967: 34)
also has pointed out that the “liberal admixture” of the side-notched
Ensor points with the smaller arrowpoint styles is at least suggestive
of a degree of contemporaneity in his extraordinairly well-stratified
Arenosa Shelter at the mouth of the Pecos River in Val Verde County.
I might also suggest that both sizes were probably used on arrows, as
it seems to me unlikely that a group would use both the bow and the
atlati.
This hypothesis seems quite reasonable with reference to various
ethnographic data. Spier (1928: 151), for instance, mentions that the
Havasupai of northern Arizona (who also have the mescal pit type
ring middens) used arrowpoints 3 to 6 cm. long (well within the limit
of the small dart points). The shorter points were used with reed shafts
and the longer with solid wooden shafts of willow. We, of course, do

129

not as yet know how the late dart points were hafted in western and
southwestern Texas. It is interesting, however, that ring middens seem
to have come into the area with the introduction of the side-notching
tradition (Ensor-Frio period of Val Verde County area, Greer, 1966a.
1 966b: 15). It may be that a migration of peoples brought with them
the introduction of the bow, as well as special cooking techniques
applied to local foods.
More ring midden sites in the area of El Paso should be excavated
and the sites carefully studied. Only in this way can we hope to deter
mine both the cultural affiliation of the ring midden sites and the
relationship between the Jumano (or Livermore Focus) of the El Paso
area and the Jornada Branch with its strong Chihuahuan connections.
More data are also needed from this area for a complete evaluation of
ring midden sites in western Texas and southern New Mexico.
