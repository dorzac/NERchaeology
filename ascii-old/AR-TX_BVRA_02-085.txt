ABSTRACT
An archaeological reconnaissance of a proposed 45.2 mile water line in Lee,
Travis, and Williamson counties, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research
Associates of Bryan, Texas in April 2001 with William E. Moore the Principal
Investigator. The project area traverses two environmental zones, the Blackland Prairie
and a transitional area between the Blackland Prairie and the Eastern Cross Timbers
(Gould 1975). The field reconnaissance identified 20 areas where archaeological sites
may be present. Fourteen of these areas were found by driving the water line route.
Part of the proposed route was not accessible by automobile; therefore, the remaining
six areas were selected based on an examination of the topographic map for the area.
At two of the areas examined by the survey crew in the field, cultural materials, flakes
and a fractured quartzite cobble, were observed on the surface. These areas were
assigned field numbers (TS-1 and TS-2) and marked on the map. One previously
recorded site (41TV1373) is located within the project area, but it has been destroyed
by Highway Department construction.

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) was retained by the Manville Water
Supply Corporation (WSC) of Coupland, Texas through J. F. Fontaine & Associates,
Inc. of Palestine, Texas to conduct a reconnaissance survey of a proposed water line
that will service the residents of rural Lee, Travis, and Williamson counties (Figure 1).
The purpose of this project is to develop a dependable supply of safe drinking
water for 5560 families living in a large rural area east of Austin, Texas. The proposed
improvements include developing a ground water source in the northern part of Lee
County and transferring it to distribution points throughout the system. The Manville
WSC serves an area that is 28 miles wide (east-west) and 22 miles across (northsouth).
As currently planned, the water line is 45.2 miles in length and will be placed on
private land when possible. Improvements will consist of adding approximately 180,000
feet (34 miles) of 16 inch pvc transmission line, 13,000 feet (2.5 miles) of 14 inch pvc
well supply line, and 46,000 feet (8.7 miles) of 12 inch pvc transmission line throughout
the existing service. The new lines will parallel existing lines generally road rights-ofway and just inside private property. The "area of potential affect" consists of a 15 foot
permanent easement. The trench depth will be 46 inches.
The project area is depicted on five 7.5' United States Geological Survey
topographical maps: these are Beaukiss (dated 1982), Coupland (dated 1982), Manor
(dated 1988), Pflugerville East (dated 1987), and Structure (dated 1982). The planned
route of the water line, depicting existing and proposed improvements, has been
superimposed on U.S.G.S. topographic maps by J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. Each
Sheet is numbered and referred to in this report for the purpose of illustrating the route,
areas recommended by BVRA for survey, and relevant archaeological sites. The
sheets accompany the report in a folder.
Overall, the project area is located in a region known to contain significant
archaeological sites. Because of this archaeological potential, a reconnaissance survey
by professional archaeologists was warranted according to Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act. Since this is a federally funded project, no Antiquities Permit
was required. The project number assigned by BVRA is 01-07. The field
reconnaissance was conducted on April 24-26, 2001 with William E. Moore assuming
the duties and responsibilities of Principal Investigator.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check was conducted by Jean Hughes,
Assistant Curator of Records, at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
for BVRA. Ms. Hughes checked the site files for previously recorded sites in and near
the project area. In addition, information pertaining to previous archaeological work in
the region was obtained from the library at BVRA. Site forms and relevant contract
reports were reviewed in order to obtain an idea of the kinds of sites found in the
immediate area and the kinds of landforms on which they are located. During the
reconnaissance the survey team utilized 7.5' topographic quadrangles, aerial
photographs, written descriptions of soils from the soils sheets, and discussions of
previous work by other archaeologists.
The entire proposed water line was driven by the field crew. When a likely area
for an archaeological site was observed, this information was recorded on the project
area maps provided by J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. Each area was briefly
described and assigned a number (Table 1). In several places, a brief walkover was
conducted along the road bank and fence line to look for surface materials and examine
the kinds of soils present. At all times the reconnaissance team was aware of the
federal Area of Potential Effect, which is 15 feet from the county road right-of-way and
36-46 inches deep.
Likely areas for prehistoric sites are identified in this report as topographic
settings where a prominent landform is present in close proximity to a major stream or a
confluence of two or more streams. In the Blackland Prairie portion of the project area
no major streams or confluences are crossed by the proposed water line. When the
proposed water line crosses a drainage in this area it is either a minor stream or the
lower reaches of a stream. Also, the soils present in the Blackland Prairie consist of
dense clays at the surface and shallow clay loams overlying dense clays. The soil data
for this area indicate that surface clays are predominant (Werchan et al. 1974). Alluvial
settings in the Blackland Prairie were not considered high probability areas because
these soils are mainly ancient clays (Werchan 1983) and the fact that they were not
located on major streams. In the Blackland Prairie, the presence of clay at the surface
on minor streams strongly suggests the low probability for buried sites because the
subsoils in these Pleistocene uplands are also too old, often Houston Black Clay.
In the transitional area, only those areas where the proposed water line crosses
major streams were considered likely settings for deep sands in alluvial settings. The
only major stream crossing in the area not already surveyed by archaeologists is Middle
Yegua Creek. A survey by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (EHA) (Tate et al. 1997) in
this area failed to record any prehistoric sites in floodplain settings (Tate et al.
1997:Table 1). Their survey of 2420 acres in Lee County utilized only shovel tests and
no backhoe trenching. No deep alluvial settings were found that were considered
suitable for backhoe trenching.

3

EHA states that the areas having the "thickest sandy deposits (i.e., greater than
100 cm)" belong to soils located on upland stream terraces and upland areas that are
level to undulating (1 to 8 percent slope) (Tate et al. 1997:4). They found that the
alluvial soils of the Uhland series occur in the floodplains of the major streams including
Sand Branch (just to the north of Middle Yegua Creek). These soils are classified as
Aquic Ustifluvents or Entisols that are frequently flooded, especially during the spring
months. Because of the flooding, the texture of Uhland soils varies from clay loam to
sandy loam. Typically, they have a dark grayish-brown A horizon underlain by stratified
brown fine sandy loam C horizons (Tate et al. 1997:4). In the transitional area, sandy
soils were present on those prominent landforms that were inspected by the
reconnaissance team. Every prominent landform in this area was visually inspected,
and a few were walked over. Virtually all hills near streams in this area were identified
as likely areas for prehistoric sites. Most alluvial areas were examined on foot, and
some were probed with a shovel to identify the potential for deep soils. All of the areas
thus examined revealed shallow clay.
It should also be mentioned that, while driving the proposed water line route, the
reconnaissance team noted all historic sites near the fifteen foot right-of-way. Since
these sites are not within the right-of-way and will not be affected by the water line, no
historic areas were selected for further work.
Following the field reconnaissance the researchers visited Sandow Mine and met
with Ricky Gaines who provided information regarding those sections of the project area
that have been previously surveyed or are currently being surveyed.
Three areas were not selected because of previous work by professional
archaeologists. Alton Briggs conducted a survey of the New Austin Airport Project for
the City of Austin in 1988. This investigation recorded 20 new sites near Gregg and
Tower roads at the western end of the project area near Manor in the Blackland Prairie.
As a result of Briggs' survey, this portion of the water line right-of-way was not selected
for further work. The Texas Highway Department recorded prehistoric site 41TV1373
within the proposed water line route, also in the Blackland Prairie. This site has been
destroyed due to construction of a pumping station for the water system. This was
verified by the reconnaissance team who plotted the location by measuring the pumping
station on the map against the site plotting on the site form. This site was recorded as
part of a survey along Highway 290 (no report available at TARL). Therefore, this
section of the water line right-of-way was not selected for further work as it had already
been surveyed by the Texas Highway Department. A cross-country tract between
county road 313 and country road 309 was found to have been previously surveyed by
EHA (Tate, et al. 1997). This route is in the transitional area and encompasses both
sides (north and south) of Sand Branch.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check revealed the presence of one previously recorded
archaeological site in the Blackland Prairie portion of the project area (Sheet 11).
41TV1373 is a prehistoric site recorded by the Texas Highway Department in 1990 (no
report available). It was later tested by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. in 1995
(Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. 1995). This very low density site yielded only three
flakes in a 125 x 400 meter area.
A number of archaeological sites have been recorded in the Blackland Prairie
portion of the project area in close proximity to the current project area. In 1988, Alton
Briggs of Lone Star Archeological Services in Austin, Texas recorded several sites
during a survey for the New Austin Airport Project located within the Blackland Prairie;
however, no report of his work is on file at TARL. The majority of his sites for which
information is available are historic and consist of a cemetery (41TV1344), late 19th and
early 20th century houses (41TV1346, 51TV148 - 41TV1349, 41TV1352 - 41TV1355,
41TV1358, 41TV1362 - 41TV1363), and trash dumps and scatters (41TV1359,
41TV1361). Two prehistoric sites are described by Briggs as a "light lithic scatter"
(41TV1357) and an "open campsite" (41TV1360). Although not one of these sites is
within the fifteen foot right-of-way, his investigation covered that part of the proposed
water lilne route along Gregg and Tower roads (sheets 6 and 11). Site 41TV1741 was
recorded by Russ Brownlow and consists of a "dubious find of one chert core, a historic
ceramic sherd, and a glass fragment probably transported by water from an alluvial fan
off a plowed field above. The field of contained chert cobbles, but all shovel tests were
negative.
Three other sites are in the area (41TV1211, 41TV1212, and 41TV1347).
Unfortunately, no data exists for these sites.
A previous survey on Alcoa mine property by EHA (Tate et al. 1997) produced
numerous prehistoric sites. Although not one of these sites is within the fifteen foot
easement as currently planned, four sites (41LE162, 41LE163, 41LE167, and 41LE176)
are in the vicinity of the project area just to the north of Middle Yegua Creek. The
artifact density at these sites varies from very low to moderate, and the sites are
described as lithic scatters. Only 41LE176 was considered to possess research
potential and warrant additional work. This is a moderately dense prehistoric site
yielding 42 pieces of debitage and fire-cracked rock. Because of the potential for buried
cultural features and/or cultural zones, the Texas Historical Commission concurred that
the site be tested if avoidance is not possible.
The reconnaissance survey resulted in the identification of 20 areas considered
likely to contain archaeological sites. Each area is a ridge or hill in close proximity to a
creek. Of the 20 likely areas, 10 are located on sandy hills in the transitional area, and
10 are located on Blackland Prairie soils. At areas TS-1 and TS-2 (Sheet 15), cultural
materials were observed on the surface that identified these localities as prehistoric
sites. No historic features such as cisterns or wells were observed within the right-ofway. Several standing structures older than 50 years were seen, but they were outside
the project area right-of-way as well.

6

Based on previous work in the area it is recognized that historic sites are less
tied to natural water sources than their prehistoric counterparts. It is, therefore,
hypothesized that the archaeological potential in the Blackland Prairie portion of the
project area is high for historic sites and low for prehistoric sites. Based on the elevated
position in the landscape, the uplands in the Blackland Prairie typically consist of clay
residual soils formed from cretaceous age clays, marls, and shales that are preHolocene in age (Cory Crawford, personal communication, May 24, 2001). On the
lower positions in the landscape, soils formed from recent alluvium may be Holocene in
age. According to geomorphologist Cory Crawford, the potential for buried prehistoric
sites in the pre-Holocene upland soils is zero.
If the current county roads follow the routes of older roads it is unlikely that
historic house sites and associated features such as water wells, cisterns, and
outbuildings will exist that close to the right-of-way, and none were seen. Therefore, it
is assumed that significant historic remains within the proposed water line route are
unlikely.
The potential for prehistoric sites in the transitional area portion of the project
area is believed to be high. The varieties of landforms on which prehistoric sites have
been found are as follows. Three sites at the Sandow Mine which were tested in 1977
(Ippolito and Childs 1978) were located on an interbasin slope (terrace knoll)
overlooking a secondary drainage, on an interbasin slope (hilltop) in close proximity to a
tributary of the same secondary drainage, and on a floodplain terrace overlooking the
primary channel of Sandy Creek. It should be repeated here that the large area survey
in the area by EHA failed to locate any sites within floodplain settings.
Evidence of the potential for sites with buried cultural materials in the transitional
area is documented by sites 41LE162 and 41LE163. These sites, located on Alcoa
property near the project area, yielded artifacts to a depth of 90 cm (Tate et al.
1997:98).
The proposed water line passes through the rural communities of Beaukiss,
Cele, and Coupland. All three communities were established in the 19th century (Webb
1952). Although standing structures that meet the age criterion for the National
Register of Historic Places were observed in these communities, the Manville WSC
plans to avoid them by placing the water line in already disturbed highway rights-of-way
(J. F. Fontaine, personal communication, May 24, 2001).
There are two cross-country portions of the pipeline. The first does not traverse
any major creeks and was, therefore, not selected for survey. The second does cross a
major stream, Middle Yegua Creek. Both sides of this creek appear to be suitable for
the presence of archaeological sites.

7

RECOMMENDATIONS
BVRA recommends that 20 areas identified during the reconnaissance survey be
examined during a Phase I archaeological survey for the presence of prehistoric or
historic archaeological sites. In the Blackland Prairie section of the project area soils
are likely to be shallow and consist of a heavy clay and/or clay loam. The subsoil in the
Blackland Prairie is believed to be too old to contain cultural materials. Most of the sites
found by Alton Briggs in the Blackland Prairie portion of the project area (see discussion
above) are situated in Houston Black Clay. According to the soil survey for Williamson
County, this soil type is found on ancient stream terraces and uplands (Werchan
1983:5).
It should be stated again that the course of the water line as currently proposed
does not cross any major streams in this portion of the project area. Only minor
streams and lower reaches of streams were observed on the maps and in the field. The
Blackland Prairie areas will be examined through shovel testing. No areas within the
Blackland Prairie are recommended for backhoe trenching. Typically, the Houston
Black soils have an upper layer of dark gray clay about 32 inches thick. They layer
below, to about 54 inches, is dark grayish-brown clay. The underlying material to 62
inches is mottled, grayish-brown clay. The soil is calcareous and moderately alkaline
throughout (Werchan 1983:6). Again, the results of previous work in the immediate
area failed to locate sites with significant subsurface deposits. Virtually all sites
previously recorded are surface lithic scatters, historic trash scatters, or other historic
sites such as cemeteries and standing structures.
In the transitional area, soils are usually a fine sandy loam or clay loam with the
potential for buried cultural components. It is also true in this area that the underlying
clays are probably too old to contain cultural materials. These areas will be examined
by shovel testing. If any cultural materials are found, additional tests will be excavated
to determine site significance and size within the right-of-way. The project area as
currently proposed crosses only one major stream, Middle Yegua Creek. Since this is a
major floodplain for the area, backhoe trenching is recommended if sandy or loamy soils
are present and are too deep to be evaluated through shovel testing. Both sides of the
creek should be tested. Based on previous work in the area by EHA it is unlikely that
deeply buried deposits are present in the floodplains of the various minor streams that
are present in the rest of the transitional area.
Regarding the entire APE, it should be repeated here that most of the water line
route as currently proposed crosses minor streams or lower reaches of streams, both in
the Blackland Prairie and transitional areas. These areas are not considered likely
settings for prehistoric sites and were, for the most part, not selected for survey.
