ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed natural gas pipeline in east Jefferson and
west Orange counties, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) on August 8th -10th, 2006. This investigation examined three high probability
areas along the five mile pipeline route, all in Orange County. That part of the project area
on the east side of the Neches River was in a marshy area with little relief. On the high
ground above the river in Jefferson County, the entire area had been disturbed through
pipeline construction and other development associated with oil and gas refining.
Nineteen shovel tests were dug through sand and clay. No prehistoric or historic sites
were identified, and no artifacts were collected. The pipeline as currently planned will
have no affect on significant cultural resources. It is recommended that construction be
allowed to proceed as planned. No artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION
Duke Energy Field Services of Houston, Texas plans to construct a
natural gas pipeline across a portion of east Jefferson and west Orange counties,
Texas (Figure 1). The length of the line is five miles. It will be placed in a trench
24 inches wide and a minimum of four foot cover. The diameter of the pipe is
twelve inches. The easement width is 60 feet. The project area is depicted on
two USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangles. They are Beaumont East dated 1960
and photorevised in 1974 (3094-111) and Terry dated 1957 and photorevised in
1974 (3093-222) (Figure 2). The entire project area is on private property.
Therefore, no permit from the Texas Historical Commission was required. This
report will be submitted to the United States Corps of Engineers, Galveston
District for review as they have jurisdiction of this area because the pipeline route
passes through wetlands and crosses the Neches River.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general statements regarding the environment of Jefferson
and Orange counties were taken from the soil survey for Jefferson County by Crout
et al. (1965) and the Texas Almanac (Kingston and Harris 1985). There is no
published soil survey for Orange County. These counties are located in the
extreme eastern part of Texas. The landscape ranges from the high ground on the
west bank of the Neches River in the eastern part of Jefferson County to a low
marshy area in the western part of Orange County. The project area passes
through two completely diverse areas. At the western end, it traverses a highly
developed area that has been completely disturbed through construction activities
associated with oil and gas refining. Pipelines, storage tanks, buildings, and roads
litter the landscape. Just across the river, in Orange County, the project area
passes through a wetlands area containing a few islands only a few feet above the
surrounding water. In some of these areas pine trees and mixed hardwoods are
present along with various grasses and weeds. Figures 3 and 4 depict two views of
the area surveyed.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Jefferson and Orange
counties are situated within the Southeast Texas Archeological Study Region.
Major threats to sites in this area are population increase, oil and gas production,
and some timber exploitation.
The project area is located in an environmental setting that has been greatly
affected by oil and gas production. To the west is a large refinery that is the
connection point for numerous pipelines. One of these was installed by the
Centanna Intrastate Pipeline Company in the 1990s. Along the route of this
pipeline, archaeologists from Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. recorded site
41OR85 in 1994 (Skokan and Nash 1995). This prehistoric site was found at the
edge of a reed marsh on a small low sandy knoll within the pipeline right-of-way.
Two chert flakes were found in shovel tests between 10 and 30 centimeters of the
existing ground surface. The size of this site was estimated to be 10 meters in
diameter, and disturbance was estimated to be about 50% due to bioturbation and
pipeline construction. The researchers state that portions of the site appear to be
undisturbed, and testing for significance is recommended.
In 2000, archaeologists from Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. recorded
site 41OR87 (Brownlow 2001) along the right-of-way of the proposed Centennial
Pipeline. This prehistoric site was found on a small sandy knoll adjacent to a
slough within the pipeline right-of-way. Two chert flakes were found in shovel tests
(depth not given). The size of this site was estimated to be 10 meters in diameter
based on the landform and shovel tests. The researchers state on the site form
that the site is 100% intact with bioturbation the only disturbance observed. They
state that site 41OR87 is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. It is defined on the
site form as a small temporary camp that may be associated with nearby site
41OR85.
In 2004, archaeologists from HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recorded site 41OR89
(Hughey and Picklesimer 2004) along the right-of-way of a proposed pipeline. This
site is located on a sandy knoll on the southwest corner of an island surrounded by
marsh. Artifacts recovered include ceramics, projectile points, lithic debitage, and
cut nails. The site was examined by shovel testing and 1 x 1 meter excavation
units. There are no comments on the site form regarding site significance, and the
report documenting this work is still in progress
Other pipelines are present in the area, but there are no archaeological sites
associated with them. The interested reader is referred to the site records at
TARL for information regarding these project and Archeology in the Eastern
Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document published by the Texas Historical
Commission (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993) for a discussion of Southeast Texas.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL were checked for the
presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area and
vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in Jefferson and
Orange counties were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area.
Field Survey
Based on the topographic map, five locations along the proposed pipeline in
the marshy area east of the river appear to be likely settings or high probability
areas for archaeological sites. The field inspection, however, determined that only
three of these (Areas 1-3) were worthy of shovel testing. Figures 5 and 6 depict the
location of all areas visited including the high ground on the west side of the river.
The field survey was conducted on August 8th â 10th, 2006 under the supervision of
James E. Warren with a field crew of two persons. The five areas east of the river
traverse a landscape with little relief above the surrounding marsh.
The field survey was performed by a 100% Pedestrian Survey on all dry land
with a visual inspection of all exposed areas due to erosion and or human
disturbance. On the high ground above the river, a larger area was examined
because the crew was told that the route of the pipeline may deviate from what is
depicted in this report. The subsurface was examined through shovel testing. All
excavated earth was screened through quarter-inch hardware cloth. Data obtained
from shovel tests were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I). All shovel tests
were backfilled after evaluation and mapping, and the location of each test was
plotted a field map (see Areas Surveyed below). These figures are enlargements
of the areas depicted in figures 2 and 3 above. Photographs of the project area
were taken with a digital camera. The entire route was flagged and staked;
therefore a GPS was not used.

AREAS SURVEYED
Area 1
Although this area is depicted on the topographic map as a large green
area, the survey crew found it to be a small landform only about 1 or 2 feet above
the surrounding water. The vegetation in this area consisted of pine trees, mixed
hardwoods, and various grasses and weeds. A marsh buggy was used to reach
Area 1 as travel by car or truck in this area was not possible. Four shovel tests
were excavated in those areas where soil was present. Shovel tests 1 and 2
(eastern edge of landform) were dug through fine sand before reaching clay at
depths of 60 and 80 cm. No cultural materials were recovered. Shovel tests 3
and 4 (western edge of landform) were dug through fine sand before reaching
water at 20 and 30 cm. No cultural materials were recovered. One flake and two
pieces of mussel shell were observed on the disturbed surface of the previously
installed pipelines to the south of the project area. No archaeological site in this
area is depicted on the topographic map at TARL. The artifacts were not
collected. Figure 5 depicts the approximate location of the four shovel tests in
Area 1.
Area 2
Although this area is depicted on the topographic map as a large green
area, the survey crew found to be a small landform only about 1 or 2 feet above
the surrounding water. The vegetation in this area consisted of pine trees, mixed
hardwoods, and various grasses and weeds. A marsh buggy was used to reach
Area 2 as travel by car or truck in this area was not possible. Five shovel tests
were excavated in those areas where soil was present. The tests were dug
through fine sand before reaching clay or water at depths of 15 to 60 cm, and no
cultural materials were recovered. Two archaeological sites (41OR87 and
41OR89) are depicted on the TARL maps as being to the north of the project
area. The survey crew terminated shovel testing with Shovel Test 9 at the
western edge of this landform. This test was dug to 25 cm before reaching
water. No tests were dug to the west of this test because of standing water.
Figure 6 depicts the approximate location of the five shovel tests in Area 2.

Area 3
This area is located just to the west of the main channel on the Neches
River in Orange County. On the topographic map the area appears to contain
areas with some relief that may have been suitable for prehistoric occupation.
The survey crew was informed that the soil here consists of dredge spoil from
several episodes of dredging the ship channel. The crew observed the soil to be
coarse sand with scattered shell, mostly Rangia sp. According to the informant,
the spoil is 20 feet thick in places where the new pipeline will be installed.
Starting about 200 meters away from the bank of the river, the new pipeline will
be installed by boring beneath the river channel. Therefore, there will be little
disturbance on the surface. A 100% Pedestrian survey of the area was
performed, and no cultural materials were observed. No shovel tests were dug.
The crew used the marsh buggy to visit this area also.
Area 4
This area consists of a wetlands just across the river and the uplands
above the river where the development associated with oil and gas refining is
situated. At the time of the survey, the crew was told that the new line may
change. Therefore, the crew walked over a much larger area and visually
inspected the surface. Virtually the entire area was found to be disturbed, and no
shovel tests were excavated.
Area 5
This area was reached by private vehicle. The field crew found dry land
with mixed pines and hardwoods. Although the area and been scraped and filled
during installation of the existing pipelines to the south plus others that converge
from another right-of-way, the area was shovel tested because of its proximity to
Anderson Gully to the south. In all, 10 tests were excavated. They were dug
through a sandy clay and silty clay overlying firm clay in some areas. Figure 7
depicts the approximate location of the 10 shovel tests in Area 5. No cultural
materials were encountered.
Area 6
This area was reached by private vehicle. The field crew found the area
to be virtually identical to Area 5 except it was further from the gully. Based on
the lack of cultural materials in the 10 shovel tests in Area 5 and the greater
distance to water, Area 6 was not considered a high probability area. Therefore,
no shovel tests were excavated.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed three prehistoric
sites have been recorded in the vicinity of the project area. No evidence of these
sites was found during the current survey. Sites 41OR85 and 41OR87 are small
sites that are to the north of the area examined. Site 41OR89 may be a larger site,
but it is also outside the current project area. The only evidence of a prehistoric site
found by the survey crew consisted of one flake and two pieces of mussel shell in a
disturbed context associated with a previously installed pipeline. There is no
archaeological site plotted on the TARL maps in this location. BVRA believes that
additional prehistoric sites are likely to be found in the area, but the route of the
pipeline as currently proposed did not pass through any such locations. Most of the
area examined was low and marshy. Only three areas contained enough soil to
warrant shovel testing.
This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS
BVRA conducted an archaeological survey along a five mile route for a
proposed natural gas pipeline in Jefferson and Orange counties. No prehistoric
sites were found, and no standing structures or evidence of historic utilization of the
project area other than the refining area on the west bank of the Neches River. It is
recommended that Duke Energy Field Services be allowed to proceed with
construction of the pipeline as currently planned. If the route is changed additional
survey by a professional archaeologist may be necessary. Should evidence of a
prehistoric site or historic site greater than 50 years be encountered during
construction, all work must cease until the situation in the area of the find can be
evaluated by the Corps of Engineers, Galveston District.
