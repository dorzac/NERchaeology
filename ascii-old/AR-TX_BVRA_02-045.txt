ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of four proposed well pads (each one acre in size
except B-3 which is 1.44 acres and C-3 which is 1.72 acres), 2549.86 meters of
pipeline, and 1158.1 meters of access roads was conducted by Brazos Valley Research
Associates on October 12 and 13, 1996. This project was conducted for Famcor Oil,
Inc. of Houston, Texas. The project area is located in the Sam Houston National
Forest, San Jacinto County, Texas. This investigation was performed using the
pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing and probing. No prehistoric sites
were found, and the only historic remains in the project area is an old railroad grade
which is not significant. It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as
planned.

INTRODUCTION
Famcor Oil, Inc. of Houston, Texas plans to construct four well pads, three
access roads (1158.1 meters), and a pipeline (2549.86 meters) in the Sam Houston
National Forest, south-central San Jacinto County, Texas (Figure 1). Except for B-3
which is 1.44 acres and C-3 which is 1.72 acres, the well pads are approximately one
acre in size and are identified by Famcor Oil, Inc. as Famcor #B-2 Foster, Famcor #B-3
Foster (Navarro A-1 Foster), Famcor #B-4 Foster, and Famcor #C-3 Foster (Mosbacher
#1 Foster). When completed, the disturbance caused by the pipeline will be 25 feet
wide and 6 feet deep. The project area is located in the 2556 acre Foster Minerals
lease that is part of the George Taylor survey (Abstract 292).
The project area is depicted on the 7.5' U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle
Coldspring dated 1960 and photorevised in 1976 (Figure 2). The U.T.M. coordinates for
well pad Famcor #B-4 Foster, the approximate center of the project area are Northing
33 80 120 and Easting 2 95 200. This area is the property of the National Forest
Service, United States Department of Agriculture and is administrated through the New
Waverly District office. Wally Kingsborough is the district archaeologist, and John E.
Ippolito is the archaeologist for the Forest Service holdings in Texas.
The nearest permanent stream is Turkington Bayou. The main channel of this
drainage passes through the site of previously constructed well pad Famcor #A-2 Foster
and crosses the access road from A-2 to proposed well pad B-2. At its nearest point,
this stream is about 100 meters southwest of well pad B-2 which is located on the
southern slope of a sandy ridge. Two tributaries of Turkington Bayou branch off to the
north and help drain the project area. One branch crosses the proposed pipeline route
and its channel is approximately 400 meters east of B-2, 300 meters east of B-3, and
300 meters west of B-4. These well pad sites are also situated on sandy ridges, while
the channel of the second branch crosses the proposed pipeline route approximately
200 meters to the east of well pad B-4.
Turkington Bayou is part of a larger drainage system that is created by the San
Jacinto River. This river has an East Fork and a West Fork. The closest branch of the
San Jacinto River is the East Fork which is approximately 2500 meters to the west of
well pad B-2. Overall, the project area is situated within an area containing numerous
dry stream channels and sandy ridges. No natural springs are known to exist in the
current project area (Richard Hughart, personal communication, October 15, 1996).
Previous archaeological surveys in the vicinity of the current project area have identified
both prehistoric and historic sites and the county contains several significant
archaeological sites. Therefore, an archaeological survey was required by the State
Historic Preservation Officer (S.H.P.O.), the lead review and compliance agency, before
construction is allowed to proceed. In order to satisfy this requirement, Famcor Oil, Inc.
contracted with Brazos Valley Research Associates to perform this service. No permit
from the Texas Antiquities Committee was required for this project.

This well pad location is part of the Coldspring Oil Field that contains several oil
and gas well pad sites. Overall, this area has been the locus of intensive oil and gas
exploration as indicated by oil and gas wells, pipelines, and access roads on the
topographic quadrangle. The project area is situated in the south-central portion of San
Jacinto County, south of Coldspring (the county seat) and north of the Liberty Hill
Cemetery. The main highway in the area is F.M. 2025 that runs north south and, at one
point, is 200 meters west of well pad B-2.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coast Plain physiographic
province and the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:98-100). The
overstory vegetation in the project area is primarily large pines while the understory
consists of various shrubs and forbs. A more detailed discussion of the environmental
setting for the Sam Houston National Forest is presented in Ippolito's (1983) thorough
overview of Texas National Forests. The surface geology is the Willis Formation that
consists of various sands and clays containing some small gravels. The reader is
referred to Volume I (Stratigraphy) of the Geology of Texas by Sellards et al. (1932) for
a more in-depth discussion of the geology of this area. In terms of their topographic
setting, the well pads are situated on sandy upland ridges overlooking Turkington Bayou
and its tributaries, while the access road and pipeline cross portions of these streams
and low-lying areas as well as upland ridges and divides.
Soils
The project area is depicted in the soils book for San Jacinto County (McEwen et
al. 1988) on Sheet Number 75. Most of the project area is within Pinetucky fine sandy
loam (PfB), 1 to 5 percent slopes, and a small portion may be in Pinetucky and Conroe
soils (PGB). Pinetucky fine sandy loam is a gently sloping soil found on broad, smooth,
upland plains (McEwen et al. 1988:37-38). This soil typically has a fine sandy loam
surface layer about 12 inches thick and a subsoil of yellowish-brown sandy clay loam
about 28 inches deep. Below this is a yellowish-brown sandy clay loam with a depth of
56 inches. This soil is moderately well drained and runoff is slow to medium. Seasonal
wetness and moderately slow permeability are seen as major limitations to modern use
including recreation.
Pinetucky and Conroe soils (McEwen et al. 1988:38-39) are nearly level to gently
sloping soils on convex uplands that have been altered by the mechanical removal of
ironstone gravel from the surface layer.
The soils appear to be mixed throughout most of the project area due to past
logging, oil and gas exploration and extraction, and road building activities. Most of the
soils encountered consisted of medium to fine sands, yellowish in color, with a
moderate to high density of concretions. Underlying the sands, were clayey sands with
dense hematitic inclusions.
The vegetation consisted of a mixed pine/hardwood secondary growth upland
forest with 100% ground cover consisting of pine duff and leaves. Hardwoods observed
were sweetgum, holley, and French mulberry. Most of the area just to the south of well
pad B-3 and east, including the area encompassing well pad B-4, has been severely
disturbed due to earlier gravel pit mining.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Previous Investigations
San Jacinto County is located in the Southeast Texas region as defined by
Biesaart et al. (1985:76) in Prehistoric Archeological Sites in Texas: A Statistical
Overview published by the Office of the State Archeologist, Texas Historical
Commission. This is an area that was well documented in terms of numbers of sites in
1985 when compared to other regions of Texas. When the statistical overview was
compiled, a total of 1630 prehistoric sites (8.06% of the state) was recorded in the entire
region. Only four of the thirteen regions in Texas reported more sites or had a higher
percentage statewide. In terms of county statistics only two counties (Chambers and
Harris) had more recorded sites (132) in 1985. The 132 sites recorded in the county in
1985 consisted of 8.10% of the region and .65% of the state. The reader is referred to
the overview for additional statistical information concerning San Jacinto County and its
relation to the rest of Texas.
Although numerous archaeological investigations have been conducted in San
Jacinto County, the vast majority has been small area surveys, often resulting in
negative findings. Many of these investigations resulted from the demand placed on the
landscape by the oil and gas industry. A bibliography of the Southeastern Region of
Texas by William E. Moore (1989) contains a listing of all work done in San Jacinto
County through 1989. In addition, an ongoing project sponsored by the Department of
Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical Commission is engaged in abstracting contract
reports by year. To date, volumes have been published for 1987 (Moore 1991), 1988
(Moore 1990a), 1989 (Moore 1993a), 1990 (Moore 1992a), 1991 (Moore 1992b), and
1992 (Moore 1994a).
Two overviews of the archaeology of the National Forests of Texas have been
published. In 1979, Ross C. Fields (1979) prepared a report that discussed the cultural
resources of each forest. This was followed by Ippolito's (1983) more extensive work.
Ippolito's effort provides a comprehensive discussion of the archaeology of all four
forests and is the most recent and thorough review of the archaeology of the Texas
national forests available.
The first major archaeological investigation to be conducted in San Jacinto
County was survey and testing in the Livingston Reservoir. The initial survey was
conducted in 1963 by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) and recorded
sites within and adjacent to the proposed lake. Most of the sites located were found to
occur towards the southeastern end of the lake. The results of the survey have been
reported by Nunley (1963).

6

Two of the sites found during the Lake Livingston survey in San Jacinto County
were tested in 1965. These were the Trichel site (41SJ16) excavated by TASP
personnel and the Houston site (41SJ19) excavated by members of the Houston
Archeological Society. Both sites have been classified as Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric in age based on the presence of dart points, arrow points, and ceramics.
The only other prehistoric site to be excavated in San Jacinto County is the
Strawberry Hill site (41SJ160). This site was investigated by the Texas Highway
Department in 1974 (Keller and Weir 1979). Strawberry Hill yielded a large quantity of
artifacts but, according to the authors, produced little new information. It is described as
a multi-component site containing both Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials.
A historic contact period Indian site in San Jacinto County dating to the midnineteenth century was excavated by Dick Ping Hsu (1969) through the combined
efforts of the Houston Archeological Society, science students of Coldspring High
School, the Texas Building Commission, and the Texas Water Development Board.
Glass trade beads and silver brooches had never been reported from this section of
Texas and the presence of burials and other historic and native manufactured artifacts
make this a very significant site. It is hypothesized by Hsu (1969:47) that the "AlabamaCoushatta was probably the group that buried their dead in this location."
It is beyond the scope of this negative findings report to discuss every
archaeological investigation in the Sam Houston National Forest. Several recent
efforts, however, are worthy of mention. These include three surveys of well pad sites
in the Mercy Oil Field in 1992 by James E. Corbin (1992) and Brazos Valley Research
Associates (Moore 1993b, 1994b) and the Coldspring Oil Field by James E. Corbin
(1994). The 1993 study by Brazos Valley Research Associates recorded prehistoric site
41SJ48, and the 1994 study by Corbin recorded prehistoric site 41SJ49.
Most recently three major works have appeared which contain detailed overviews
relevant to Southeast Texas and the project area. These are Archeology in the Eastern
Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document by the Department of Antiquities
Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Roger G. Moore's (1995) Ph.D. dissertation
entitled The Mossy Grove Model of Long-Term Forager-Collector Adaptations in Inland
Southeast Texas, and Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society.
The latter reviews the current state of Archeology in Texas and contains a chapter
devoted to Southeast Texas (Patterson 1995).

Cultural Chronology
The cultural chronology of this part of Texas is, according to Story (1981), by no
means completely understood. Other researchers such as Aten (1983), Bement et al.
(1987), Bond and Moore (1980), Ippolito (1983), Keller and Weir (1979), Moore (1978,
1990b), Patterson (1979a, 1979b, 1979c, 1983, 1986, 1989), Shafer and Stearns
(1975), Shafer et al. (1975), Story (1974, 1981), Story et al. (1990), and Wheat and
Gregg (1988) have discussed the chronology of Southeast Texas and the Texas
National Forests in more detail and the reader is advised to consult these sources for
additional information.

FIELD METHODS
The project was divided into three phases - background and archival research,
field survey, and report preparation. The background and archival research consisted
of a check of the site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
The Principal Investigator performed this task.
Background and Archival Research
A check of the site records at TARL was conducted to identify any previously
recorded sites, if any, in the project area. In order to better understand the nature of
previous archaeological work in the region, the archival research included a review of
the following documents: a statistical overview of Texas archaeology prepared by the
Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985), an overview of the National Forests
in Texas by Forest Service Archeologist, John E. Ippolito (1983) a bibliography of
Southeast Texas (Moore 1989), several contract reports documenting work in the Sam
Houston National Forest (Moore 1993b, 1994b), and a series of reports containing
abstracts for Texas contract archaeology (Moore 1990a, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1993a,
1994a).
Field Investigation
Before entering the field, the Principal Investigator discussed the project with
William A. Martin of the Department of Antiquities Protection. Mr. Martin, who will
review this project for the State Historic Preservation Officer, gave permission to begin
the project on October 12, 1996. In addition, the Forest Service Archaeologist, John E.
Ippolito, was advised of the impending work.
The field investigation was conducted on October 12 and 13, 1996. Michael R.
Bradle (Project Archaeologist) supervised the fieldwork with assistance from Julie A.
Crowl and Floyd D. Kent. A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted across the entire
project area. Shovel tests were excavated at each of the well pads and along the
pipeline route and access roads. A minimum of four tests were dug at each well pad
site except well pad C-3 which was a plugged well that had already been disturbed.
Only one test was dug at this well pad site. Table 1 depicts the shovel tests according
to well pad. The remaining tests were dug throughout the rest of the project area. In
all, 34 shovel tests and 35 shovel probes were excavated. Excavated matrix was
screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Shovel test data were recorded on a shovel
test log (Appendix I) and in the field notes. Tests were dug until clay was encountered.
Depths of the tests varied from 10 to 58 centimeters below the ground surface, and the
average depth was calculated at 28.76 centimeters. In addition to the shovel testing, all
exposed areas in the project area were inspected for cultural materials.

Report Preparation
The Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist performed this task inhouse.
A draft report prepared for review by the Department of Antiquities Protection, Texas
Historical Commission, the United States Forest Service, and Famcor Oil, Inc. A copy
of the report, all notes, shovel test forms, and other records are on file at Brazos Valley
Research Associates.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
This survey did not locate any prehistoric sites or significant historic sites within
the project area. Much of the area surveyed had been previously disturbed through
logging, gravel quarrying, and previous well and access road construction. The mining
of gravel in this area appears to be extensive based on the presence of at least five
gravel pits on the section of the topographic quadrangle surrounding the project area.
Mussel shell was noted at two locations. The first location was approximately 20
meters east of the gate on the Forest Service road that leads to well pad C-3. One
small mussel shell fragment was found in the roadway. It is assumed that this shell was
brought in with fill material used in the road construction. The second area in which
mussel shell was encountered was on a severely deflated sandy surface at the tank
batteries and collection system, approximately 50 meters west of the pipeline route
where it intersects the collection facility. Three mussel shell fragments were observed.
Since no cultural materials were found in association with the shell, there is not enough
evidence to identify these areas as prehistoric sites.
The only indication of earlier historic activity observed was the remains of an old
railroad grade that passes north south and crosses the proposed pipeline route between
well pads B-4 and C-3. This railroad grade was not recorded as a site. It is depicted on
the topographic quadrangle.
Although portions of the project area appears, based on the topographic map, to
be likely settings for prehistoric sites, the lack of such sites could be, in part, due to the
shallow, moderately well drained soils with slow to medium runoff (see Environmental
Setting above). The archival research conducted for this and other projects in the Sam
Houston National Forest indicates that prehistoric sites in the area are typically found on
landforms with deep well-drained sandy soils such as 41SJ48 south of the current
project area, located by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore 1993b), and
41SJ49 west of the project area on a sandy ridge above the floodplain of the East Fork
of the San Jacinto River located by Corbin (1994). Site 41SJ48 is on a sandy ridge in
Splendora very fine sandy loam (SpA) as defined by McEwen et al. 1988:11), and site
41SJ49 is believed by Corbin to be in Doucette loamy fine sand (DoB). Both site areas
contained sandy loam to depths of at least 90 centimeters.
An apparent lack of a permanent water source in part of the project area may be
another reason for the absence of sites in the area surveyed. The combination of a lack
of natural springs in the area, as stated by Mr. Hughart, and the fact that much of this
area is drained by intermittent streams that contain only seasonal flow should be
considered.

11

RECOMMENDATIONS
No significant cultural resources were found during the archaeological survey
documented in this report. It is, therefore, recommended that Famcor Oil, Inc. be
allowed to proceed with construction as planned. The presence of an archaeologist to
act as monitor during the construction phase is not considered necessary. There is
always the possibility that cultural materials or features are missed during the course of
any archaeological survey. Should the presence of cultural materials not discussed in
this report be discovered during construction, the client is advised to cease work and
contact the State Historic Preservation Officer immediately. In addition, the Forest
Service archaeologist should be advised of the situation.
