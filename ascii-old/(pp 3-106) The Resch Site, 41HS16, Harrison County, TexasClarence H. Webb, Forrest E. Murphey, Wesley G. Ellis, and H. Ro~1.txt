INTRODUCTION
In the four-state Caddoan Area a number of ceramic complexes
precede the earliest distinctive Caddoan ceramics. Sand-tempered
pottery, apparently the first ceramic along the Texas Coast (Wheat
1953, Ambler 1967, Aten 1967), appeared at least by 150 A.D., with
associated Tchefunete sherds. Inland in the Caddoan Area sandtempered pottery was reported from the McGee Bend Reservoir in
East Texas (Jelks 1965), in Southeastern Arkansas (Hoffman, personal communication 1965) and in variable but usually small amounts
from a number of other sites in East Texas, Northern Louisiana and
Southern Arkansas, on pre-Caddoan levels and generally preceding
clay-tempered wares.
Clay-tempered ceramics are first known in the Caddoan Area in
the Fourche Maline Focus of eastern Oklahoma (Bell and Baerreis
1951: 19-9.7), immediately following non-pottery Archaic levels. On
a Hopewell-Marksville Woodland level clay-tempered pottery has
been reported in the Bellevue Focus of northwestern Louisiana (Fulton and Webb 1953), at the Coral Snake (MeClurkan, Field and
Woodall 1966) and Jonas Short (Jelks 1965) mound sites near the
Sabine River, from the Cooper Site in northeastern Oklahoma (Bell
and Baerreis 1951: 27-33) and the Kirkllam Site in north-central
Arkansas (Dickinson and Lemley 1939). Clay-tempered pottery was
dominant throughout Marksville, Coles Creek and Caddoan ceramics,
only being supplanted by shell tempering in the eastern part of the
Caddoan Area in late proto-historic times.
Bone-tempered pottery apparently was a Texas innovation. It
appeared on the coast and in East Texas almost as early as sand
tempering. Bone occurs as an aplastie in a small percentage of nearly
all pottelT types in the state, with the exception of those in transPecos (Suhm and Jelks 1962). It is the major aplastie in the pottelT
type Leon Plain of Central Texas. It occurs in Goose Creek, Alto,
Sanders, Frankston and less frequently in Titus and Texarkana
ceramics. In northwestern Louisiana bone tempering occurs in a
small percentage (up to 3~) of pre-Caddoan and Caddoan ceramics
(Fulton and "vVebb 1953, Webb 1948, 1959). It is present in Fourche
Maline pottery in Oklahoma, and Frank Schambaeh (personal eonlmunieation 1968) has found considerable amounts of bone-tempered

pottery as far east as the Ouachita River in south-central Arkansas, in
what he terms Lowland Fourche Maline, on a presumed Tchefuncte
time level; in these two states bone tempering diminishes or disappears
in later Caddoan wares.
These three ceramic traditions are associated, in their earliest
manifestations, with projectile point and tool types carried over from
the Late Archaic. No immediate and substantial change in the way
of life is in evidence as pottery was introduced.
It seems pertinent to the study of these ceramic traditions to report
our findings at the Resch Site in Harrison County, Texas, in which
the ceramics cover the span from Tchefuncte to early Caddoan times
and within which the three aplastics-bone, sand and clay-are ahnost
equally represented. Evidences of trends in popularity of these
aplastics are available; the associated artifacts will be examined with
especial attention to projectile point changes; and speculations will.
be entertained about the way of life of the people who left these
artifacts.
LOCATION OF THE SITE
The Resch Site, 41HS16, is located on lands owned by Frank Resch,
Jr., of Marshall, Texas, and is 9 miles southwest of this town, in the
southern part of Harrison County. Approximate Latitude is 32° 26’
30" N; Longitude 94° 25’ 30" W. The site is situated on the east
bank of Potter’s Creek, about 5 miles northwest of the outflow of
Potter’s Creek into the Sabine River (Fig. 1). The site covers a clearing of about 5 acres on an almost level terrace which is elevated 7 to
8 feet above the narrow flood plain. Now in pasture, the clearing was
cultivated for many years and at one time a farm house was situated
thereon. It is ,~ mile north of Farm Road 9.625.
TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL SETTING
Potter’s Creek is a small stream which rises in the hill country west
of Marshall, one of a number of small streams which drain the southern half of Harrison County into the Sabine River (the northern half
is in the Cypress Bayou-Caddo Lake drainage system and a small
sector of the southeastern part of the county drains into Cross Lake;
both of these eventually reach the Red River). Potter’s Creek flows
southward and slightly eastward to the Sabine at the southern edge
of the county. The entire valley of Potter’s Creek from the level of the
site to its terminus is only 1 to 9, miles wide; it is widened at the level
of the site by two small tributaries from the east (Fig. 1). The actual
flood plain is about 600 feet wide and the active stream bed is 30-40

feet in width. It is moderately rapid and carries a good volume of
water the year round despite its small size. When the site was first
visited the water was dear and flesh but during the past three years
it has become badly polluted. Below the site the stream has few
tributaries and meanders more than at the site level although the
valley narrows to no more than a mile in width.

Flanking the flood plain are numerous small rises, representing
dissected and flattened hill remnants or stream terraces. Further laterally are the slopes of the dissected sand-clay hills, with a soil which
has a high content of iron and contains hematite and sandstone
nodules.
This is rolling hill country within the confines of the Gulf Coastal
Plain. It is in the Aush’oriparian Biotic Province of East Texas,
described previously by Davis and Davis (1960), Jelks and Tunnell
(1959), Johnson (1969,) and others. The rainfall averages 40-50
inches annually, supporting an abundant vegetation. The hills surrounding the site are pine-clad with scattered oak, hickory, persimmon and sweetgum trees. Along the terraces and the stream valley
the trees are in greater variety including oaks, chris, gums, walnuts,
several varieties of hickories (Shagbark, Hicoria ovata, and Texas
hickory, Carya buckleyi, producing hickory nuts; Hieoria pecan, or
native pecans, and Hicoria glabra, producing pignuts), birches, sassafras, persimmons, hawthorns, hackberries, wild cherries and wild
plums, chinquapins and rare bois d’arc or osage orange. Shrubs,
including huckleberries; vines, including blackberries, wild grapes
and nmscadines; and numerous varieties of weeds produce a thick
underbrush in the flood plain. Clearings on the terraces and sloping
hills quickly grow crabgrass, bermuda grass and sedge. The number
of native food sources in this list is impressive.
Native animal life is still abundant: two species of rabbits, three
species of squirrels, opossums, raccoons, deer, black bear, foxes,
wolves or coyotes, occasional bobcats and pumas, gophers (unfortunately), minks and skunks are all present; armadillos have invaded
within recent years, and in former years otters, beavers and prairie
dogs were indigenous. Snakes are not infrequent, including water
snakes, king snakes and the poisonous varieties of moccasins and copperheads (as we learned to our sorrow when one of the children was
bitten by a copperhead during an afternoon’s dig and was desperately
ill for a few days). Numerous birds include quail, doves and woodcock of the more edible species. Migratory waterfowl include ducks,
geese, cranes and herons; during the 19th century passenger pigeons,
turkeys, and trumpeter swans abounded. Before the stream became
polluted, fish and turtles were present but the small size of the stream
makes it unlikely that either they or shellfish were important food
sources in aboriginal times. It seems more likely that nuts, fruits,
plentiful indigenous and seasonal game, and arable soil for horticulture were the attractions in this valley.

ARCHEOLOCICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND OCCUPATIONS
Harrison County reflects an intermediate archeological position
between east Texas and northwestern Louisiana, probably because
of its connection with both Sabine and Red River drainages. Sites
in the northeastern part of the county show affiliation with the Coles
Creek, Bossier and Beleher complexes, while others in the county
relate to Alto, Titus or Frankston Fool. The indicated pre-ceramie
complexes include Early and Late Paleo-Indian (Clovis, Plainview,
Seottsbluff, Meserve and San Patrice) and La Harpe Aspect Archaic,
judging by projectile points found on the surface.
The valley of Potter’s Creek was occupied during each of the
culture periods known for this part of East Texas, from Archaic to
European contact times. Despite the wooded terrain a surprising
number of sites are known (Fig. 1) in the vieinity of the Resch Site.
hnmediately north of the site, across a small draw, a terrace elevation
has surface finds of sherds and chips. Minimal testing showed materials similar to those at Resch, signifying scattered occupation during
the same time period. Further north (Fig. 1-2) another knoll has thin
Archaic occupation, although the collection is inadequate for classification. Still further north, the Jones South Mound (knoll) is ~ mile
from Resch Site, lyin~ between Potter’s Creek and a tributary, Starkey
Creek (Fig. 1-3). Plain clay-tempered sherds, ineluding those of a
bowl with incurving rim, and one linear punctated sherd do not provide information which is adequate for specific assignment. Another
small site (Fig. 1-4) on the Jones Ranch is similarly not assignable.
The third site on this ranch, Jones Pine Tree Mound (knoll), is
approximately ill miles northeast of Resch Site (Fig. 1-5). Sherds
there are more abundant; clay and bone tempering are about equally
represented. Pottery types Pease Brush-Incised, Karnack BrushedIneised, Ripley Engraved, unidentified linear punctated, red-filmed
plain and numerous other plain sherds are represented.1
Across Potter’s Creek from the Resch Site are three sites: Resch
Burial Mound, High Knoll, and Susie Slade buria! site (Fig. 1-6, 7, 8).
High Knoll has limited surface findings and is not assigned. Excavations at the Resch Burial Mound disclosed burial pits which were
9. to 5 feet in depth; skeletal material had ahnost vanished but apparently the bodies were extended. Burial placements included pottery
vessels of types Ripley Engraved, Hodges Engraved, Glassell En1Reference concerning potterv types should be made to the Texas Hand-book
(Suhm and Jelks 1962), to Ford’s group for the Lower Mississippi (Ford 1951,
Ford and Quimby 1945, Ford and Willey 1940), and to Webb 1959, 1963. For
projectile point types see Suhm and Jelks 1962, Bel! 1958, 1960, and Ford and
Webb 1956.

graved, Cass Appliqued, Pease Brushed-Incised, and Karnack BrushedIncised, arrow points of types Bassett and Perdiz, and polished celts.
The combination of Belcher Focus and Titus Focus ceramics is
further evidence of the intermediate position of Harrison County
between the Caddoan complexes of northwestern Louisiana and East
Texas. Twenty-five pottery vessels were available for study; of these
13 were bone-tempered, and 19. were clay-tempered. Although not
consistently true, there was a tendency for the Belcher Focus vessels
to be clay-tempered, while the majority of the Titus vessels were
bone-tempered.
The Susie Slade Site, 41HS13 (Fig. 1-8) afforded materials of the
European contact period, with many pottery vessels and with trade
goods in most burials, including glass trade beads, metal knives and
bridle parts. Recognized pottery types were Simms Engraved, Taylor
Engraved, Maddox Engraved and Maydelle Incised, all in clay-tempered paste. No shell-tempered pottery was found at this or any other
site in the valley.
Downstream, and also on the west side of Potter’s Creek, the old
Brown Place ( Fig. 1-9) is a village site on a terrace overlooking a relict
channel. The sampling is small but three whole pottery vessels from
a burial and sherds from the surface indicate an early Titus Focus
occupation, similar to the situation reported at the Harroun (Jelks
and Tunnell 1959) and Whelan (Davis 1958) sites. One of the vessels
is a bottle with cylindrical spout, the top of which has encircling
engraved lines like those seen on Hickory Engraved bottles of Alto
ceramics; the body has a courant scroll design with central circles and
with pendant or tented heavy spurred triangles; it probably would be
classified as ttipley Engraved. A bowl is carinated and shouldered;
the shoulder bears Avery Engraved decoration, while the flaring rim
has encircling engraved lines. A third bowl, also carinated and with
notched lip, has two horizontal rows of scratchy engraving forming
a tented design. All vessels are clay-tempered. Accompanying projectiles are predominantly Bonham type, with one or two which could
be called Alba.
At Henry Brown Sites No. 1 and No. 2 (Fig. 1-10, 11) on opposite
sides of Potter’s Creek about 2 miles south of the tleseh Site, burial
placements showed both villages to represent the contact period,
although there were defiinite differences in the pottery complexes.
At Henry Brown No. 1, on the west side of the stream, there were
glass trade beads, trade knives and clay-tempered pottery of types
Simms and Taylor Engraved. At Henry Brown Site No. 2 a number of
burials contained glass trade beads, a brass or copper disc, and pot-

tery Vessels of types Keno Trailed, Patton Engraved; Taylor Engraved,
Natehitoches Engraved, Wilkinson Incised, Cass Appliqued, Maydelle
Incised, Clements Brushed and Bullard Brushed. Arrow points were
predominantly leaf-shaped, of Nodena type, with a few of Maud type.
Of the 13 pottery vessels available for study, 6 were bone-tempered, 7
c!ay-tempered. Affiliations with Allen, late Titus and Glendora Foci
are suggested by vessel types.
EXPLORATION AND EXCAVATION PROCEDURES
The existenee of the Resch Site had been known to the Reseh
family sinee the time of the present owner’s grandfather and the site
had been clear and in cultivation for many years. Forrest Murphey,
Wesley Ellis, Roland Green and their wives, of Marshall, Texas,
explored the site while they were engaged in excavations of the Resch
Burial Mound and Susie Slade Sites across the creek. During 1963 and
1964 they made prelimina~T tests to discover the depth of the midden
and the possible nature of its contents. In one of these trial pits Mrs.
Murphey unearthed, at about the .3 foot level, fragments of an entire
vessel of Tehefuncte pottery (Figs. 8 d and 9). Realizing the unusual
nature of this vessel and of the sherds and lithics found at the site,
they contaeted professional archeologists. Buddy Jones saw the site
and identified the vessel, but was unable to give assistance at that
time. The senior author was later contacted by Wesley Ellis and made
arrangements to visit the site in early 1965.
This site is on the southernmost of two adjoining clearings, each
about 4 to 5 aeres in size, and both recently reverted to pasture land.
Occasional surface sherds or chert flakes are to be found over most
of the !ower clearing but are concentrated nearer the stream. The
major part of the site is along the crest and slopes of a mildly eroded
terrace (Fig. 2) that is irregularly oval in shape along a NW-SE axis.
Potter’s Creek swings sharply against the northwestern portion of the
terrace and apparently has eroded into it at its highest level, which
is 7 to 8 feet above the flood plain. From this high point the terrace
slopes gradually away from the stream and also slopes gently southward. At the southwest angle of the clearing (Fig. 2) the s!ope is
steeper, down to flood plain level; at this point the creek swings westward into the valley but traces of an old channel eut across the
southern edge of the site. In the center of the clearing, immediately
east of the major site, there is a !ow area whieh is marshy in wet
weather and shows no evidence of aboriginal occupation, although
there are traces of occupation east of it, along the margin of the
clearing. At the southeastern end of the site there is another oval-

shaped depression, tree-covered, which has the appearance of a
borrow pit (possibly resultant from road building during the 19th
century, although we could find no record of such). It is known that
a dirt road passed through the site, near the present road (Fig. 2) and
that a house was located at the south end of the excavated area.
Work was started on the site on March 14, 1965. After the preliminary survey, base-line N-S and E-W coordinate axes, based on magnetic north, were set in the area chosen for initial investigation, near
the place where the Tchefuncte vessel was found. A metal stake was
implanted at the 0-0 intersection and this was triangulated with nails
set in two trees, a gum on the bank of the stream west of the intersection and a pine to the northeast (Fig. 2 A, B ). That part of the site
around the intersection was staked in a grid of 5-foot squares. The
excavation began in the first 3 squares south of the horizontal axis
(E-W) and parallel to the east side of the vertical axis. By agreement
bordering lines or profiles were recorded simply in feet from the
original coordinate axes and squares were recorded by number in
relation to these axes (i.e., the first three squares were E1S1, EIS2
and E1sg).
Participants in this initial excavation were the authors and their
wives, Dr. A. L. Wedgeworth of Shreveport, his son Lang and daughter Ann, and Dr. Antley of Barksdale Field, La. Subsequently other
friends and visitors have given assistance for which the authors are
appreciative. These include the owner, Frank Iteseh, Jr., and members
of his family, all of whom have had a sustained interest and have
prevented depredation; Burney MeClurkan, who investigated the site
as a possibility for the 1966 Texas summer dig, and his son Kevin;
Lou Fraser, Kelly Arnold, Billy Maloney, Terry Itoden, Michael Beckman, Reverend Jim Simpson, Monroe Dodd, Jr. and his family, tlosemary Webb and the Webb grandchildren, Sarah, Bill, John and
Larkin. Most of the excavations were carried out between 1965 and
1968 by the Murpheys, Ellis and Greens, joined by the Webbs on
40-50 afternoons. The dig has been conducted as a family affair, with
the wives attending to creature comforts like food, refreshments and
care of the children, when they were not participating in the excavations. Tarpaulin shelter, refrigeration, eleetrieity for lighting, eampfire
cooking, garden vegetables in the excavated areas, and even television
have been available, with lounge chairs for respite from digging. The
senior author highly recommends this comfortable approach to areheological exploration; withal a high quality of technique was attempted.
Records were kept by Murphey and Webb, and Webb accepted the
responsibilities of typology and description.

Each square was excavated by 6-inch vertical levels, since no
natural stratigraphy was discernible. Levels were recorded as Levels
1 to 9 beginning from the surface. Each level was troweled by thin
vertical slicing or horizontal shaving, dirt was screened when this
seemed indicated by the appearance of small objects and, after completion of each level, its floor was scraped to look for features. Excavations were carried 6 to 12 inches below the last appearance of artifacts
or midden stain, usually 48 to 60 inches. Objects from each 6-inch level
were placed in labeled sacks and at the end of each day’s work they
were cleaned and individually labeled by Murphey, indicating square
and depth by level. At intervals they were transferred to Webb for
typing and tabulation. In most instances individual squares were
worked and refilled as completed, since this was pasture land and
open pits were avoided. Balks were left between squares to record
profiles and prevent caving; after adjoining squares were worked, the
balks were troweled. In some instances 2 to 5 adjoining squares were
excavated sinmltaneously, when the party was large, or in order to
uncover or search for features, or to secure profiles. Field sketches
were made by Murphey or Webb.
In the central block (Figs. 2, 3) 245 squares were excavated, a total
of 6,19.5 square feet. In addition 13 squares were dug as tests outside
the immediate periphery of this block; 19 were dug across the access
road on the east side; and 8 were dug north of the N100 foot line
along the highest part of the ridge. Three test squares were placed
adjacent to the borrow pit along the old stream bed south of the
clearing (Fig. 2), Altogether 288 squares were dug, covering 7,200
square feet of surface and incorporating approximately 9,5,000 cubic
feet of midden.
I~ESULTS OF EXCAVATIONS
Over the major excavation block, the top 7 to 11 inches were a sandy
loam topsoil of the plow zone, with grass, weed and shrub roots in
abundance, and with many interruptions. At least by the 19,-inch
depth, on Level 3, a homogeneous midden zone appeared. This zone
is of fairly loose sand with enough clay and midden humus to make
this a darker reddish-brown sandy loam, and it continues down to
the 30-36 inch depths of Levels 5 and 6. The soil then shifted to a
lighter color with numerous white sand streaks and a number of small
sand cones that were vertical, circular on cross section, and 3~ to ~
inch in diameter ( Fig. 4 A, C). At a depth of 36 to 49, inches, by Level
8, clearwhite sand appeared and continued as far as we tested, which
was usually down to 48-60 inches but in a few instances was as deep

part of this sand were followed. Some appeared to be small aboriginal
disturbances, although none had the characteristics of a storage pit
or recognizable appendage to a house structure. Others seemed to be
deep root penetrations.

we thought could result from insect burrows, tree roots, a water filtration phenomenon, or some similar non-human agency. They were
much too regular in size and distribution to have resulted from stakes
or wands stuck in the sand by inhabitants. There were many rodent
and insect burrows in the midden, also a number of large vertical
columns or cones of burned soil, charcoal and sometimes rotting
wood, interpreted as burned stumps resultant from land clearing in
the last century. These originated from the top 12 inches.
The topsoil and first few inches of midden of Levels 1 and 2 contained few aboriginal artifacts, such as flakes, stone tools, and occasional sherds. There were many objects from the 19th or early 20th
century occupation, including square nails, crockery sherds, buttons,
household and farm implement fragments, and rotting cedar or cypress
wood. Beginning with Level 3 below 19. inches, these objects disappeared with rare exceptions in intrusions, and aboriginal artifacts
progressively increased in numbers, with the gn’eatest concentration in
Levels 5, 6 and 7. They became very scanty in the white sand of
Levels 8 and 9. Figs. 21, 22 indicate these trends. Objects like sherds,
projectile points, knives, scrapers, flakes and other smaller objects
tended to be dispersed throughout the midden thickness; similarly
they were scattered horizontally throughout the excavated block,
with only a few concentrations (Fig. 3). Debris consisting of hematite
and sandstone nodules, petrified wood slabs or fragments, whole and
broken small chert cobbles, and flakes, was found throughout the
midden. One of the excavators coined the term "stash pits" for the
frequent clusters of pebbles, with occasional artifacts, found in filled
gopher tunnels.
Clusters of larger stone objects included hammerstones, manos,
pitted stones, anvils, and fire-darkened and cracked sandstones. Fig.
4 C illustrates the occurrence, at the 33-36 inch depth of Square EIS3,
of such cluster: a hematite hammerstone, a pitted stone and a broken
sandstone. Fig. 4 E shows a larger group, between the 30-36 inch
levels of Squares E7S1 and E8S1, which includes 9,1 sandstone cobbles
averaging fist size and many fire-blackened or broken; 50 small pebbles
of sandstone, petrified wood and hematite; a few fragments of charcoal; and 44 stone flakes. Eighteen of the flakes were of petrified wood,
9 of tan chert, 7 of red chert and 10 of gray chert or flint. At the edges
of this debris were 2 pot-sherds, 2 dart points and a chert knife. This
was interpreted as a hearth, although ash was missing and the soil
was not fire-hardened. The location of a number of these clusters is
indicated in Fig. 3. The largest was found in 4 adjoining squares,

accumulations occurred (Fig. 5). This was a mass of stones over an
irregular area, 5 to 6 feet in diameter, numbering several hundred
and varying in size from pebbles to rocks 7 to 8 inches in diameter and
weighing 10 to 15 pounds. Included were masses and flat segments
of iron-sandstone, hematite of hard and soft varieties, petrified wood
and chert cobbles. Several could have been used as hammerstones or
anvils and one was a pitted stone, but most showed no evidence of
use. Also, curiously, no charcoal, ash or artifacts were in association.
The purpose of this rockpile is only conjectural and possibly it was
simply this-a rockpile for future use.
We found no prepared hearths and no ash beds with associated
animal bones which might indicate cooking areas. Moreover, despite
a few molds which might represent posts set by the inhabitants, we
found none which were arranged in anything like a house structure. In
3 adjoining squares (F~g. 4 E) 4 molds of 4 inch diameter and a
larger mold, 16-18 inches in diameter and charcoal-stained, showed
on tlie 30 inch level. The large interruption could be followed fi’om

THE IRESCH SITE

12 inch depth to 42 inch, the smaller molds could be followed from
30 to 36 inch depth. However, no adjoining squares had molds to
form a pattern with these.
No evidence of burials was found. The few bones found were
badly decayed and all seemed to be animal bones. A few were recognized as deer bones but most were inadequately preserved to alloW
identification-often only streaks of white bone in the midden sand.
Fragments of charred walnuts, hickory nuts and pignuts were scattered through the middens. No other plant food sources were recognized. Only small fragments or streaks of wood charcoal were found,
apart from the burned wood in the tree stump interruptions. Nut
and wood charcoal was saved for radiocarbon dating.
In the southwestern sector of the excavated block a number of
previously dug and filled pits were recorded (Fig. 3). The fill of these
pits rarely contained artifacts, except for flakes and discarded spalls,
and those few that were found were not used for stratigraphie analysis.
The surface in this sector slopes rapidly toward the old stream bed,
beginning about 20 feet southwest of the 0-0 intersection, but the
midden and the subjacent midden-sand junction had a similar downhill
trend, so that it was not necessary to correct the depth relationship of
recovered objects in analyzing the artificial stratigraphy. In fact, the
midden thickness varied surprisingly little over the entire site.
We had hoped that the northern end of the terrace, immediately
by the stream, would show a heavier midden and a higher yield of
artifacts. However, the 8 test squares (Fig. 2) north of the N100 foot
line, nearly all in a wooded area, were less productive than most of
the excavation block. On the northern crest the top 18 inches consisted of a 6 inch zone of topsoil with root masses, then a 12 inch zone
(Fig. 4 B ) of lighter sand below which was the darker homogeneous
sand-loam midden. Ve13~ little was found in the top 18 inches and 4
of the 5 sherds from Levels 1-3 had the characteristics of Coles Creek
or Early Caddoan. The midden below the upper sand had a mixed
zone on top at 18-9.6 inch depth, then the dark homogeneous zone
down to about 50 inches, then the streaked zone to approximately
59.-56 inches, below which was sterile white sand as shown in Fig.
4 B. In one of the northern squares, WllN38, a cluster of burned
and broken sandstones occurred at the 48 inch level, Level 8 (Fig.
4 D). The evidenee therefore is that the original occupation in the
northern part of the ridge was at about the same elevation as at the
excavation block and that the present higher elevation at the northern
end is the result of deposit of sand on top of the terrace after the
major oecupation of the site. The mechanisms by which the midden

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

18

was built up uniformly by a 2~-3 foot increment during occupation
of the site and by which the superimposed sand was deposited on the
northern end after its desertion were not revealed by excavation.
There were no discernible layers of water-deposited sand or clay.
The three tests along the old stream and near the borrow pit south
of the site showed shallow middens with only traces of occupation.
The midden was no more than a foot in depth, slightly darkened,
with rapid transition to the sterile subjacent sand. Rarely were flakes
and broken stones found. These evidences of light occupation discouraged further exploration.
The eastern slope of the terrace between the access road and the
depression in the center of the clearing (Fig. 2) was more productive.
There were 19 squares excavated in this area. The midden had about
the same thickness as in the excavated block and the density of
occupational evidences averaged about half that of the major block.
Ten sherds were found in Square E23N2, 9 of these in Level 5 (24-30
inches). Square E16N16 yielded 7 sherds, 6 of these in Levels 6 and 7.
Otherwise a low yield of 1 to 4 sherds per 5 foot square indicated a
diminished occupation. The only feature of significance in this part of
the site was the large roekpile in Squares E15-16 N16-I7. We coneluded that the major occupation of the site was along the NW-SE
axis of the higher terrace remnant paralleling the stream. Major excavations were confined to the southern portion of this because it was
in open pasture, in contrast to the wooded northern pol~ion, and also
because it did not have the additional foot of soil overburden. The
absence of trees made it possible to excavate a large block completely.
ARTIFACTS
A.

CERAMICS

There are 1541 pottery sherds from the site, excluding those from
which the original Tchefuncte vessel (Fig. 9) was assembled. The
latter had been found and the vessel finished before organized excavation was undertaken, but the vessel is included because its location
was within the excavated area and three additional sherds were found.
Three additional vessels have been assembled from the excavated
sherds, one completely, the other two in major part suffleient for reconstruction (Fig. 8). For the latter two, sherds are present to complete
the bases, major sections of the rim and enough body sherds to assure
continuity h’om base to lip. Lesser portions of other vessels have
been fitted together, but insufficient to justify reconstruction. Sherds
from which these vessels and segments were assembled are included

THE RESCH SITE

19

in the sherd studies but the individual vessels will also be described
under type studies.
The ceramics fi’om this site show an interesting but disconcerting
diversity. A respectable percentage fits into established types, from
Tehefunete, Marksville, Troyville and Coles Creek ceramics as described in the Lower Mississippi Valley (Ford and Quimby 1945,
Ford and Willey 1940, Ford 1951) and from pre-Caddoan and early
Caddoan ceramics of East Texas (Newe!l and Krieger 1949, Suhm and
Jelks 1962, Jelks 1965). However, much of the pottery does not fit
these established types, and further diffleulties obtain in that a high
percentage of sherds is undecorated. Moreover, a variety of aplastics
used as intentional tempering or aeeidenta!ly included makes for
difficulties in organizing the material into a distinctive indigenous
tradition. There are present three major aplastics-clay or grog
(ground sherd), bone, and sand-which we think are intentional
tempering materials; there are at least seven minor and probably
accidental kinds of inclusions: hematite and gravel granules, charcoal,
ash, ocher, quartz and burned-out vegetal material. To compound
the typological difficulties, nearly half (43 percent) of the sherds
(Table 3 ) have a mixture of two or more of these aplastics.
The decision was made to study and describe the ceramics in a
tri-partite way: first, by dividing the sherds into three groups in
accordance with the major aplastie, regardless of recognized types,
and determining the characteristics within each group; secondly,
reclassifying by recognized types or indicated groupings regardless of
tempering; and finally, to assess the possible significance of the previous groupings through distributional or stratigraphie studies. The first
method of study is pursued with fu!l knowledge of the fact that many
existing pottery types have varying temper characteristics and that
some aplastics may be accidental or due to local variations in available clay beds. However, we have noted that the three major aplasties
had different origins and histories during the development of ceramics
in eastern Texas. Moreover, this decision was strengthened by indications, borne out by complete studies (Tables 1, 2), that vessel wall
thickness, throughout the life of the site, was distinctly different for
bone, sand, and clay-tempered sherds, despite expected overlaps.
This difference extends also to those sherds which are sorted by major
aplastie, even though a mixture is present: sherds tempered with
bone, alone or as the major aplastie, are thicker; those tempered with
sand are intermediate in thickness; and clay-tempered sherds average
having the thinnest walls; even the extremes of wall thickness follow
the same trends (Table 1).

1. SAND-TEMPERED POTTERY There are 364 sherds which we classify
as sand-tempered (Table 3). Of these 149 have sand as the only
recognized aplastic, 107 have sand with small amounts or a few flagments of bone, 92 have sand with smaller amounts of clay particles or
grog, and 16 have all three aplastics but sand is the major one. With
two exceptions, to be described below, there are no perceptible
differences in other physical characteristics between those sherds
tempered with sand alone and those in which other materials appeared. In addition to these three aplastics, 23 of the 364 sherds have
one to several granules of hematite per sherd; these nodules are
smooth, round or ovoid, and 1 to 8 ram. in diameter.
As a group the sand-tempered sherds are firm to very hard, are
rarely crumbly except when the surface has been eroded, and in
most instances have adequate clay matrix to assure good agglutination
of the small sand grains. Although the surfaces have a gritty feel and
fine particles of quartz glisten with reflected light, the manufacture

THE

seems to have included enough surface rubbing to float a thin coating
of clay to the surfaces and make them reasonably smooth on both
exterior and interior. However, when two sherds are rubbed together,
a grittier sound is made than is true of the clay-or bone-tempered
sherds. Sherd size, about the same as in the clay-tempered, varies
from 1 to 8 cm. in greatest diameter and most of the sherds are between 2 and 5 era. in diameter. A generally rectangular shape suggests
that the vessel walls were built up by coils, although the few bases
available seem to have been made in a unit. Thickness of the body

walls (Table 1) ranges from 4 to 13 mm., averaging 7.6 mm. in the
sherds which are tempered with sand alone and 7.7 mm. for those
with mixed temper in which sand predominates. Bases vary from 9
to 18 mm. in thickness.
Surface and core coloration of the sand-tempered sherds indicates
variations of firing temperatures and conditions, with some possible
variations resultant from the paste characteristics. Of the 364 sherds,
142 (39.01Y~) have uniform colors of exterior and interior surfaces
and cores, usually light colors which include buff, orange, light to
dark gray and light brown. Oxidizing temperatures are indicated.
Some 122 sherds (33.51Y~) have the same range of lighter colors on

22

the exterior with black or dark gray for the interior and much of the
core. This is presumably from fring in inverted position with smoke
darkening of the interior. Fifty-five sherds (15.11~) are black on both
surfaces and throughout the cores, indicating reduced firing conditions; another 21 sherds (5.77g), representing two vessels, are dark
brown to black throughout Seven sherds have light coloration of
exterior and interior surfaces, with black cores; 5 have gray to black
surfaces and vmT light cores. The remaining few sherds are variable,
probably as a result of fire clouds. Two matching sherds with uniform
color have a black substance on the exterior, possibly asphaltum.
The 364 sherds encompass 99 rim, 5 fragments of bases and 330
from the body walls. Four sherds have conical perforations, drilled
from the outside. Two of these, presumably from the same vessel,
are rim sherds in which the perforations are 3.5 em. from the lip.
Nearly all of the 29 rims are vertical and direct (Fig. 6 i); none has
the appearance of flaring or outward rolling. The lips are rounded in
most instances, sometimes thinned by an external bevel. Six rims have
flat lips, equal in thickness to the vessel walt. Four rims are incurvate,
all with thinned, rounded lips, and two of these have lip notching;
the notches are fairly deep, placed diagonally in one instance and
transversely in the other (Fig. 6 e, f). Additionally, three of the rims
with flat lips have tiny notches on the outer lip edge. Two of the latter
probably derive from the same vessel, hence sherds from 4 vessels
have notched lips; all others are plain.
Of the 5 basal sherds, three are small fragments which give no idea
of size or shape. One is a complete small flat disc, 5.5 cm. in diameter
and 9 em. thick, with smooth exterior and rough interior surface. It is
sand-tempered with a small amount of grog. Around the periphery
there are 4 indentations, with an edge projecting downward, suggesting that the adjacent wall may have had podal projections (Fig. 10 j ).
The other basal sherd represents about ~ of the total base and is similarly small, about 5.5-6 era. in diameter and 15 ram. in thickness. The
ventral surface is concave and the doughnut-like edge extends directly
upward for 1 era. before curving outward (Fig. 10 f). It also has a
mixture of sand with a small amount of grog, and the core is puddled
or contorted as often seen in Tehefuncte sherds. No sherds which
suggested a conical base were found.
The 330 body sherds are remarkable, insofar as evidence of shape
are concerned, mostly in a negative way, except the four groups of
matching sherds noted below. Fairly uniform size and shape is indicated by sherd curvatures; there are no appendages, appliques or
acute angulations to indicate wall modifications.

FIG. 6. Sand-tempered sherds. Plain sherds and vessel portions: a-f; notched
rims: e, f; incised decoration: g, h, j, k; rim profiles, interior to left: i.
Five groups of matching sherds could be fitted to form sections of
vessels. One of these will be described under decorated sherds. A
second group consists of 13 sherds with heavy sand tempering, almost
sandstone in consistency, reddish-buff in color, shading to black near
the vessel base. They derive from what appears to be a flowerpot-like
small vase form (Fig. 6 b), with wails which thicken from 0 mm. in the
upper portion to 13 ram. where the wall joins the base, which apparently was circular and thick. The outer surface is irregular and has
shallow vertical flutings placed 1.5-S em. apart, which corresponds to
the distance between an adult’s fingers, suggesting vertical smoothing
with the open hand.
Three other sherd groups are fitted to form sections of deep open
bowls or "flowerpot" vases. A group of 20 forms the lower wall of a
vessel, indicating a circular base of 8-9 cm. diameter, and outward

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

24

flaring walls (Fig. 6 c). Another group of 21 sherds derives from the
rim and upper wall of two vessels; one is a deep bowl and the other
seems to be a vase form. Rim diameters of 24-28 era. are indicated
(Fig. 6 a, d). These sherds are preponderantly sand-tempered with
some coarse bone and nodules of:hematite; they have sufficient day
matrix to give a very compact paste, and they are well fired to a redbrown color. The result is a hard, almost metallic ware which rings
when tapped and which we dubbed "East Texas ironware"; it is the
hardest and firmest prehistoric pottery which we have seen from this
area.
Decorated sherds: Of the 364 sand-tempered sherds, only 18 (4.95
percent) are decorated, if we except the plain sherds with notched
lips. Four of the 18 are from one vessel, including two rim sherds (Fig.
6 g, h). The indicated shape is a barrel-like jar with vertical rim and
flat lip, with wall thickness of 8-11 cm. The paste is sandy with rare
bone and hematite fragments, as hard as the "ironware" described
above. The entire outer surface is decorated with firm incised lines.
Two parallel lines encircle the rim, and between the upper line and
the lip there are vertical nail punetations. Body panels are indicated,
with concentric circles or ares surrounding a central rectangle. Separating these major panels are small double groups of concentric rectangles. Two other small sherds have single deeply incised straight
lines and two have curving incised lines. Two rim sherds have diagonal lines incised with a notched or forked tool to produce double
incisions, and another small sherd has multiple, closely placed parallel incisionsl One large and 3 small sherds of another vessel show a
single horizontal incised line, above which are V-shaped lines which
possibly form alternating triangles (Fig. 6 k). One sand-tempered
sherd has tool punetations zoned by deeply incised lines (Fig. 10 p),
another has horizontal incised lines. The final decorated sherd is
black, sand-tempered, firm, with nail pinches which form V-shaped or
triangular punctations (Fig. 10 e).
Vessel shapes .which are indicated by the above descriptions include
deep bowls, large "flowerpot" vase forms with gently curving lower
walls, cylindrical and barrel-shaped jars, and bowls with constricted
rims. Flat disc bases and concave extended bases are indicated and
tetrapods are possible. Shallow :finger fluting of lower vessel walls
occurs.

9,. BONE-TEMPEnED POTTEI~Y There are 599 predominantly bonetempered sherds from the site (Table 3) of which 397 are’tempered
with bone alone, 169 with bone and some sand, 9,1 with bone and
small: amounts of clay-grog, and 12 with all three aplasties but with

THE RESCH SITE

.

25

bone predominating. Only 12 of the b0ne-tempered sherds show
particles of hematite, which indicates that the potters were less likely
to pick up this extraneous material when theyused bone for the
aplastie than when they used sand or grog. However, many of the
sherds of all three wares had tiny brown specks or smudges which
we interpreted as due to the presence of hematite ocher in the local
clays.
In general physical characteristics this is a good ware. The sherds
are firm, with a greater tendency to brittleness than the clay or sandtempered sherds. The surfaces, except when there is considerable sand
in the paste, are smooth but not polished. Wedging of the paste is
somewhat better than in the other wares, although the larger particles
of bone make this imperfect. Sherd size varies more; there are numerous large sherds, in excess of 6 cm., but also many small fragments,
apparently due to the brittle quality; numerous small sherds are
split through the core. Unit~ construction of the bases and coiling for
the vessel wails is indicated by sherd fracture; the coil breaks are
often beveled, indicating that they were welded by shearing motions
of the hands, as described by Aten (1967) at the Jamison site. In the
Resch sherds this motion was upward or from the base toward the rim
on the exterior, downward on the interior, which is opposite to that
described by Aten. Body, walls are thicker than in the other wares,
with a range of 5 to 13 mm.-and averages of 8.3 mm. for sherds tempered with bone alone, 8.0 mm. with mixed temper (Table 1). There
is no evidence for a change in this tendency during the occupation
of this site (Table 2). Bases were 12-17 ram. thick.
’The external surface coloration is mote pleasing than in the other
wares. Reds, oranges and reddish buff c0!ors predominate, with lesser
numbers of varying shades of gray~ and a few dark brown to black.
A white speckled appearance is given by the numerous bone particles,
which vary from barely visible up to 5 mm. in diameter. Few of the
sherds are smoothed sufficiently to float er~ough clay to the surface
to cover the bone particles. Firing is variable, so that clouds or variations in color on the same vessel are produced; oxidation is generally
more complete than in the clay-tempered sherds from this site. Of the
599 sherds, 169 (27.88~) are uniformly light in color throughout the
core; 290 (48.41~) have,light colors on the exterior with darker,cores
and interior, surfaces; 59 (9.85%) are dark on both surfaces, and
through the core; and 51 (8.51~) have light surfaces and dark cores.
The599 sherds include 27 rim sherds, 30 derived.from ~bases, and
542 from body walls. Three sherds hav.e:pei?fgrations, two of which
exhibit onnter~ drilling. There are ~no ,vesse~ appendages,,spec!alized

The rims more often are direct, not thinned, with rounded lips
(Fig. 7n). Eighteen are direct, 6 incurvate, 3 excurvate; 10 are
thinned, 17" are not; 17 of the lips are rounded, 9 (including 6 from
Vessel 4) are fiat, and one has a slight external roll. One (Fig. 7 m)
has diagonal incisions across the fiat lip, one with thinned and rounded
lip has tiny notches, and one is a segment of eared rim.
From the 30 basal sherds, 4 complete bases were reconstructed. In

THE

RESCH

27

each of these, the base had broken into 4 sherds. These 4 bases are
9.2, 10, 11.5 and 12.4 cm. in diameter. They are disc-shaped, flat or
gently concave on the interior and gently rounded or convex on the
exterior (Fig. 7 o-q). The other basal fragments show a similar shape,
some being more strongly convex. Vessels with these bases would be
unstable on a flat surface. There are no podal appendages or evidences of concave, squared or extended bases.
The 542 body sherds are not remarkable, except that the thickness
and curvatures on many indicate a moderately large size, consistent
with Vessel 4 described below. This conclusion is also suggested by
the fact that 90 percent of the total bone-tempered sherds are from
the body wall, i0 percent from rims and bases combined. The same
proportions hold for the sand-tempered sherds, and these may be
compared with a proportion of 81~ body sherds among the clay-tempered. Moreover, two groups of bone-tempered sherds, in addition
to Vessel 4, were matched in sufficient numbers to indicate vessel diameters of 20-25 era.
There are 58 decorated sherds among the 599 bone-tempered
(9.68Y~): 11 of these are rim sherds. Of these, 22 (including 7 rims)
derive from Vessel 4 which has a band decorated with deeply incised
diagonal lines in triangular grouping, with small punctated fields
(Fig. 8 a). Thirteen additional sherds have similar diagonal and parallel lines (Fig. 7 a-e). One of these is a rim sherd with bone and sandtempering. Several have clay or grog temper in addition to the sand,
but bone is the predominant aplastie in the entire group. Three additional sherds have decorations with similar heavy, rounded lines which
form curved patterns (Fig. 7 i-l). In all of these instances the deep,
trailed lines resemble the lines which border the bands of rocker
stamping to be described for the clay-tempered sherds.
Three sherds from the same vessel have a band of decoration which
features alternating groups of diagonal lines and small punetatefilled triangles (Fig. 11 y, z). The incisions and punctations are made
with a pointed tool. One rim sherd shows excurvate form, Two other
sherds have single short incised lines, but the sherds are too small to
disclose a pattern. Three thick sherds have random punetations
made with the fingernail in two instances and with a pointed tool in
the other (Fig. 7 f-h). One rim sherd shows two horizontal lines below the rim which is direct and rounded. Seven bone-tempered sherds
are decorated with brushing (Fig. 11 aa-cc), which in six instances is

3. CLAY-TEI~IPERED POTTEItS_" There are 563 sherds classified as claytempered. Of these, 332 have clay particles usually recognizable as
crushed sherd (grog) as the only aplastic; 149 have clay with sand or
grit as a second aplastic; 44 have clay as the major tempering but
have a few particles of crushed bone in addition, and 38 have clay as
the major with both sand and bone as minor aplasties. In the total
group, 24 sherds have particles of hematite of the same size as noted
for the sand-tempered sherds.
In comparison with the sand-tempered sherds, the clay-tempered
group tends to be firm but not as hard, lacking the metallic appearance
and ring on tapping. The paste is not uniform and many of the sherds
have a crumbly core. Conversely, the surfaces are smoother and some
of the thinner (Coles Creek and Caddoan) sherds have a homogeneous paste with hard, polished surfaces. The sherd size is comparable
to the sand tempered, 1 to 8 era. in greatest diameter, and most of the
sherds are 2 to 4 era. in diameter, with the same tendency to rectangular breakage which indicates coiling manufacture. The vessel walls
average 7.2 mm. in thickness in those sherds which have only clay
tempering, and 7.0 ram. for those with mixed tempering, with a
range of thickness from 3 to 11 mm. in both groups, As noted in
Table 1, this wall thickness is less than in the sand-tempered or bonetempered sherds. Clay-tempered basal sherds range from 10 to 15
ram. in thickness, averaging between 12 and 13 ram.
The coloration of the surfaces and cores shows more evidence of
firing under reduced temperatures. Only 140 (24.9~) of the 563 sherds
have a uniform light color throughout the core and on both surfaces.
A much larger number, 236 (41.92%), have light colors on the external
surfaces with black to dark brown interiors and cores, and an additional 78 (13.85go) have light exterior and interior surfaces and black
cores. The color range of the oxidized areas includes dove gray, buff,
reddish-orange, medium gray and light brown. The red-buff to light
brown color predominates, but a few thin, polished, orange sherds
are outstanding. There are 90 (16Yo) sherds that are black or dark
brown throughout. One sherd has a black exterior and core, with a
light gray interior. Colors of the remaining 18 sherds are variable or
difflcult to determine because of small size or worn condition. A
single vessel often has variable coloration, with a tendency for the
basal portions to be darker, especially on the interior, and "fireclouds" are often present.
The 563 clay-tempered sherds include 71 rim sherds, of which 3
are rims of bottle spouts; 460 derive from the body wall; 22 from
bases; and 10 additional spout sherds. Only one sherd, a rfin sherd of

30

TEXAS

ARCHEOLOGICAL

SOCIETY

Vessel 3, has a perforation placed 2 cm. below the lip. It is drilled
from the exterior and tapers from 8 ram. in diameter to 5 mm. at the
interior opening. The opposite rim sherd is missing.
The 71 rims (Fig. 7 v) show a much greater tendency toward the
ineurvate form than among the sand-tempered sherds; 33 are ineurvate, 26 direct and only 4 exeurvate. One is not only ineurvate but constricted and cambered (Fig. 11i), 1 has an internal roll and 1 is
angulated and is apparently a section of an eared bowl. A few of the
lips are flat and 1 of these is twice as wide as the vessel wall. Nearly
all are otherwise rounded and slightly thinned. Ten of the rims, ineluding 6 from Vessel 3, have notches across the lips, transversely.
The 3 spout rims (Fig. 11 l-n) are direct and all are decorated with
horizontal engraved lines.
The 22 basal sherds (Fig. 7 w) include 9 with black interior surfaces and light exteriors; 2 black throughout; 5 with black cores and
light surfaces; and only 6 which are light in color throughout the thickness. One base is almost complete, 9 em. in diameter, 10 ram. thick
and gently convex on the lower surface. Seven seem to be portions of
flat discs, one of these having a probable diameter of 9.5-10 era.
Another circular base of similar size is gently concave on its lower
surface. Two have upward extensions of 8-10 ram. on the side wall
before curving outward, and one of these has a deep concavity of the
lower surface (Fig. 10 g), similar to one of the sand-tempered bases.
A small sherd (Fig. 10 h) wffh paste suggestive of Tehefunete Plain
has an outward projection or flange formation of the lower wall;
another small sherd has a mammiform podal projection which is 1.7
ram. in diameter and 5 ram. in height (Fig. 10 i). Two sherds have rim
and base components which show them to derive from flat bowls;
both are plain and have slightly insloping direct rims.
Vessel shapes suggested by the body and rim sherds are shallow,
flat bowls with narrow rims; deeper bowls; flower-pot shaped vases;
jars with rounded bodies and upright or outward sloping high rims;
barrel-shaped or deep semi-globular vessels with constricted orifices;
eylin&ieal jars and bottles with tapered spouts.
Decorations include a greater variety than in the sand or bone-tempered ceramics. There are 49 decorated sherds (8.7%) among the 563
clay-tempered, excluding the 10 with notched rims. Eighteen sherds,
of which 8 are rim segments, have multiple parallel incised lines,
apparently all placed horizontally below the rim (Fig. 11 a-g, w).
Three sherds have a single incised line. Two are small but the third is
larger, with ineurving cambered rim and one smoothly incised line
below the rim (Fig. 11 i). One sherd is deeply incised with parallel

THE

RESCH

SITE

31

lines in zones (Fig. 10 o). One sherd combines rectilinear incising
with zoned punctating. Another has a single row of punctates in the
center of bands which are outlined by incised lines (Fig. 7 t). Two
sherds with linear triangular stamping, found during the excavation,
derive from Vessel 1. There are 4 sherds, 2 thick, 9. thin, with random
punctations (Fig. 7 r, s), 3 made with tools, one with nail gouges.
Thirteen sherds have rocker stamped decoration in zones outlined
by deep incisions (Fig. 11 l-n). Six sherds have engraved decoration;
4 are bottle spouts with engraved encircling parallel lines. Two are
bottle shoulders with similar encircling engraved lines (Fig. 11 r, s).
Three vessels have been reconstructed from clay-tempered sherds.
Vessel 1 is the discovery Tchefuncte vessel (Fig. 8 d, 9). It is made of
firm, clay-tempered paste, with better wedging than usual for Tchefuncte wares but with a thin powdm7 exterior coat which flakes off
readily. Oxidizing temperatures resulted in light colors on both surfaces and through the eore. Surface colors vary from orange-buff to
greenish to light brown. The shape is a cylindrical jar with constricted
base, mildly flared, rolled rim and rounded lip. The height is 17.2 era.
The diameters are: orifce 15.5 to 15.8 cm., midbody 19. cm., base
10.9, cm. The thickness of the vessel wall varies from 8 mm. near the
lip to 6.5 at midbody and 7 mm. at the base. Only half of the base
was found; it has 11 mammfform podal supports in cog-wheel arrangement around the outer circumference. The decoration consists of 14
ench’eling bands of triangular stamping apparently done with a single
tool. Each band is decorated with alternating upright and pendant
triangles and with a zig-zag ridge of clay of near-uniform width
between the impressions. Between the bands are two parallel encircling lines formed by drag-and-jab technique. Three similar lines
are between the topmost band and the lip, and three lines separate the
lowest band from a narrow plain zone above the podal supports.
Vessel 9. (Fig. 8 b) is completed from 13 sherds, with only two small
sherds missing. It is tempered with clay, bone and sand, with the
clay predominating; the paste is somewhat lumpy and the surfaces
irregular. It is a plain cylindrical jar with a wavy rim, to the extent
that the height varies from 12.4 to 13.5 cm. Diameters are 13.9 to 14.4
em. from the lip down through most of the body. The lower body
curves in to a small, mildly convex disc base which is 6.5 to 7 cm. in
diameter. The walls are thick, averaging 9 ram.; the base is 14 ram. in
thickness .The rim is thinned by an inner bevel and the lip is rounded.
Vessel 3 (Fig. 8 c) is a deep bowl with incurving rim and eonstricted orifice. It was reconstructed from 19 sherds which afforded
about two-thirds of the total Vessel. The paste is clay-grit tempered,

TEXAS

32

ARCHEOLOGICAL

SOCIETY

firm with moderately smoothed but unpolished surfaces. The interior
surface has a crackled appearance. The vessel is 12.8 to 13.4 era. in
height. Diameters at the rim, as reconstructed, are 16 to 16.5 cm. and
at midbody are J_8 to 18.5 era. The walls average 8 mm. in thickness,
but vary considerably, from 7 to 9.5 ram. The base is convex and
there is no evidence of separate construction of a disc base; in fact,
the base is continuous with the side walls. The rim is thinned to a
slightly rounded lip, which has deep notches spaced at 8 ram. intervals. A perCoration, 3 era. below the lip, is drilled from the exterior;
the opposing sherd is missing.
4. OTHER APLASTICS Fifteen sherds have other aplasties or some
unusual combination of aplastics, most of which are probably accidental (Table 3). Three sherds are light in weight and have vacuoles
which presumably result from vegetal materials which burned out in
the firing process. Two of these sherds from the same vessel are deeorated with a vertica! band outlined by incised lines and bisected by
a row of punetations. Five sherds have numerous particles of coarse
gravel, mixed with sand or clay, or a sand-clay eolnbination. Four
sherds have ash or charcoal, along with clay, bone or sand in varying
amounts. One sherd has a combination of bone, clay, sand and burnedout fiber. Another sherd has clay, sand and crushed ocher. The final
sherd has sand, bone, gravel and crushed ocher. The last two sherds
described have large amounts of ocher, not the occasional stain seen
in the paste of many sherds. Except for the two decorated sherds all
others with unusual aplastics are plain body sherds.

B.

CERAI~Ics--POTTERY TYPES

In this section vessels or sherds will be assigned, where possible, to
known pottery types of the Lower Mississippi Valley and of eastern
and southeastern Texas. This can be done with certainty only for those
sherds which are decorated or have distinctive features relating to
form, lip treatment or basal segments. We shall then consider the
untyped sherds, especially the plain, as they appear to relate to the
ceramics of this area.
i.

TCHEFUNCTE PERIOD

TCHEFUNCTE PLAIN:
19 sherds are thought to be Tchefuncte
Plain, on the basis of paste characteristics, surface finish or shape. Six
of these are basal sherds which, in addition to consistent paste characteristics, have shapes which are confined to, or more frequent in,
Tehefuncte ceramics. Three have annular bases with ventral concavities and with extension up the outer wall (Fig. 1-0 f, g). A fourth
projects outward to form a flange base (Fig. 10 h). One has a mammi(a)

TIlE RESCI-I SITE

33

form podal support (Fig. 10i) and the final sherd is the disc base
(Fig. 10 j) with four downward projections which apparently joined
tetrapodal supports on the wall.
Additionally, we think that Vessel 3 (Fig. 8 e) fits Tehefunete Plain
type. The modified globular bowl shape, the constricted orifice, the
rounded and crudely notched lip and perforations are seen in this
type (Ford and Quimby, 1945, Fig. 17). The clay-grit paste and the
surface appearance is consistent, as is the vessel wall thickness and
generally crude manufacture. Flounded or convex bases were not
found often in the Lake Pontehartrain Tchefunete sites, but were
stated to be not uncommon at the Lafayette, La., mound (Ford and
Quimby, 1945).
(b) ALEXANDER PINCHED: One sherd, black and sand-tempered with
minimal clay particles, has the characteristic nail pinching (Fig. 10 e)
to produce a V-shaped or triangular design seen in this type (Ford
and Quimby 1945, Plate 7 p). This is of especial interest because typical designs of the Alexander series are rare this far west of the Mississippi.
(e) TCIIEFUNCTE STA~IPED, VARIETY I~ESCH: Vessel 1 (Fig. 8d, 9)
with the two additional sherds. This is a new subtype, agreed upon
after discussion of Vessel 1 at the 1966 Caddoan Conference in Natehitoehes, La. It was formerly included under Tehefunete Stamped Type
(Ford and Quimby 1945, Plate 2) and typical examples are illustrated
in this plate, b, e, e, f.
Paste-Method of Manufacture: Coiled, flattened coils 3 em. wide.
Tempering: Clay particles, smaller amounts of fine sand.
Texture: Fine clay paste with clay particles and some sand, with
poor wedging which gives some contortion. Occasionally homogeneous texture.
Hardness: Tends to be soft, averaging hardness of 2; soft when
damp and has little tensile strength.
Color: Various shades of gray to light buff on exterior; core usually
dark.
Surface Finish: Interior and exterior smoothed but not polished.
Thin coat of clay floated to surface tends to flake off or to have a
crackled appearance.
Decoration-Design: Triangular depressions stamped on vessel in
parallel rows over entire body surface. Arranged vertically, horizontally or diagonally in double row. I~ows may or may not be separated by one or two parallel lines that are incised with drag-and-jab
technique.
Technique: In the original Tchefuncte report, Ford and Quimby

and are unable to detect evidence of rocker-stamping. Rather, the

triangles seem to be individual impressions of a triangular tool, and
the intervening lines to have been made by the standard drag:and-jab
incising technique which is frequent in Tchefuncte Incised type.
Form-l~im: Usually excurvate with rounded marginal thickening
on the exterior.
Lip: Usually rounded. No notched specimens known.
Body: Deep pots with outward eurving rims; midbody straight or
slightly barreled. Possibly bowls.
Bases: Multiple teat-like podal supports on a flat disc base. Probably
other forms of wedge-leg and teat-leg, tetrapodal or polypodal, as for
Tchefuncte Plain and Tchefuncte Stamped.
Sizes: 17 era. height and diameters of approximately 10 em. at
base, 12 era. midbody and 15.5 em. at rim for only whole vessel.
Chronological Positions and Relationships: Occurs in Tehefunete
Period. Found in ceramics of this period in the Lower Mississippi
Valley, also 9,7 sherds at the Russell Landing Site on Catahoula Lake
in central Louisiana (Gibson 1968, Fig. 5 a and p. 28), Sabine River
drainage, East Texas, at the Iteseh Site. A similarly decorated ware
was found in Burke County, Georgia at the MeBean Creek Site, in
Deptford eontext (David S. Phelps, personal communication, 1966).
Fifteen sherds with a linear triangle stamping were found at this site
in 1965, 6 of the sherds from one vessel. In temper, paste and other
technological features, the sherds correspond to other Deptford
sherds. The only identified shape was the simple bowl. Phelps stated
"On a majority of the sherds, the application of the stamp is so careful
that it appears to be a multi-unit paddle; on a few, however, the lines
wander apart, attesting to the use of a single unit tool." One of these
sherds is shown in Fig. 8 e.

MARKSVILLE--TROYVILLE

PERIODS

PLAIN: 4 sherds from as many vessels seem to fit
the eharaeteristics of this type. There are two rim sherds (Fig. 10 q, r)
whieh are very similar, of smooth black paste, clay-tempered in one
instance, day and bone in the other, from bowls with incurvate and
unthickened rims. A third rim sherd is slightly thickened by an infolded strip of clay; it is dark gray, clay-tempered, with smooth exterior and rough interior surface. A basal sherd shows evidence of a
square base; it is clay-tempered, thick and has rough surfaces.
Vessel 2 (Fig. 8 b), which is day-and-bone-tempered, has the
cylindrical shape, thick wall, irregular orifiee, thin and rounded lip,
smoothed but lumpy surface and small vessel size, which are consistent with Marksville Plain. Our difficulty lies in the fact that none
of these eharaeteristies is diagnostic, that any of them may be present

is of clay-bone-tempered paste, with brown exterior and black interior
colors. Curvilinear lines outline narrow panels which are roughened
by curved rocker-stamping. A smaller grog-tempered sherd (Fig.
10 1) is uniformly buff colored. It has 3 curving trailed lines with
panels on each side, and the rocker-stamping is done with a small,
straight bar tool. Two sherds (Fig. 10 m, n) of black grog-tempered
paste with smooth surfaces may derive from the same small vessel.
One is a rim sherd, direct, with flat lip, a horizontal row of hemieonica!
punctations just below the rim and the beginning of a decorated
zone. The second sherd is from the wall at the base and shows curving
diagonal grooved lines outlining a panel of rocker-stamping done
also with a short, straight bar.

in depth. The stamping tools were 7 to 15 mm. in width and had 4
to 8 projections or "teeth." Four sherds were derived from a black,
clay-tempered vessel (Fig. 10 v) with globular body and probably
a cambered rim, on which there are at least 3 horizontal trailed lines.
The rocker-stamping roughens the background for curvilinear plain
bands; the stamping is regular and beautifully executed. Three sherds
from a larger vessel (Fig. 10 w) are clay-tempered with buff exterior
and black interior and core. The curvilinear bands are wide and are
outlined by shallow, wide U-shaped grooves; the stamping is regular
but rougher than on the first sherd. Two other sherds from different
vessels have similar wide, shallow grooves and large designs; one of
these is sand and grog-tempered, the other grog-tempered, with some
sand, bone and hematite (Fig. 10 u, z). A smaller sherd (Fig. 10 y)
has smooth grooves, 3.5 mm. wide, and well-executed rocker-stamping.
It is clay-tempered with buff exterior color and black interior. The
final two sherds (Fig. 10t, x) are from the basal portions of the
side walls, and one includes part of a circular base. The zoning lines
are narrow and the zones are smal!, as are the stamp patterns (7-8
ram. ). Both are clay-tempered, one with brown exterior and buff interior, the other with buff exterior and black interior colors.

COLES

CREEK PERIOD

(Fig. 11 a-j).

There are 18 sherds from an estimated 15 vessels which are recognizably from Coles Creek types. As is true of Tchefuncte, Marksville
and Troyville sherds, it is probable that other sherds are from vessels
of this period. Uncertain and questionable specimens were omitted.
(a) COLES CREEK PLAIN: 6 sherds, 4 of which are derived from
rims and 2 from body walls, are of this type. One rim is direct, with
externally beveled lip, smooth interior and polished exterior surfaces.
It has firm paste and is clay-tempered with a small amount of sand
and bone particles. A second rim is direct, with a lip which is flattened
to overhang both exterior and interior walls (Fig. 11 j). The paste is
firm and clay-tempered, and the surfaces are smooth but unpolished.
The third rim sherd is large, about 1/5 of the vessel circumference,
and incurves to a constricted orifice; it is clay-tempered with hematite
nodules, and the surfaces are smooth. The fourth rim incorporates the

THE

RESCH

SITE

39

angle of an eared bowl (Fig. 11 h); it is dark brown to black in color,
and tempered with clay, bone, sand and hematite. The two body
sherds are buff to brown in co!or, clay-tempered and firm. One is
thin, with smoothed exterior and rough interior surfaces; the other
has a polished interior and a curvature which suggests a flat bowl
shape.
(b) CREENHOUSE INCISED: 1 sherd of this type (Fig. 11 i) has a
wide, externally folded rim which forms a graceful camber, below
which is a single wide trailed line. The rim is incurvate to a constricted
orifice and the lip is rounded. The sherd is elay-tenapered, black on
the interior and camber, light gray on the exterior wall; the inner surface is smooth, the outer is polished.
(C) COLES CREEK INCISED: There are 11 sherds of this type, 4 of
which are rim sherds. Four sherds are from the same vessel (Fig.
11 a), and 3 are fitted to produce 3~ of an excurvate rim with narrow,
externally rolled and rounded lip. Five parallel horizontal incised
lines encircle the external rim area. The fourth sherd from this vessel
(Fig. 11 f) suggests an undecorated sub-globular body which is separated from the rim area by a broad trailed depression. The paste is
soft, with clay, bone, sand and hematite temper; the exterior surface
color is light gray to brown, and the interior is black. Three other
rim sherds of this type have 2 to 3 horizontal incised lines encircling
the direct rims (Fig. 11 b-d). One has a thin flattened lip, and the
others are rounded. Two are clay-grit-tempered and the third is
bone-grit-tempered. Surface colors are brown to black. The 4 remaining sherds of this type (Fig. 11 e, g) have one to three smooth and
firm!y incised lines on the wall exteriors. Three of these sherds have
smooth to polished extel~or and interior surfaces, with buff to dark
gray coloration; they vary from 5 to 7 ram. in thickness. Tempering is
with clay in two instances, clay-grit-bone in the third. The fourth
sherd has rougher surfaces because of sand-tempering. The exterior
is gray in color; the interior is black. The incising, however, seems
quite consistent with Coles Creek Incised type.
4. CADDOAN PERIOD (Fig. 11 k-co).
There are 81 sherds from an estimated 49. vessels which fall into
established Caddoan types or, in the instance of plain sherds, are compatible with vessel shapes or paste charactm~sties of the Caddoan
periods.
(a) HICKORY ENCRAVED: There are 6 certain and 9 possible sherds
of this type, all clay-tempered. Four bottle spout rim sherds (Fig. 11
l-n) and 9. sherds of bottle shoulder area (Fig. 11 r, s) have the encircling engraved lines typical of this type. Additionally there are 9 plain

40

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

spout sherds. From one vessel (Fig. 11 k), there are 8 sherds which
are thick and form the tapered spout that is typical of the Alto
ceramics.

(b) DAVIS INCISED: 11 sherds (Fig. llo-q, w) have smooth incised horizontal lines. Six of them are from open carinated bowls,
3 from jar forms with tall vertical rims, and 9. from vessels of uncertain
shape. The vessel forms, paste characteristics (3 bone and 8 claytempered), and incising technique have more similarity to this type
than to Coles Creek Incised.
(c) PEASE B~usrrED-INCISED: One bone-tempered sherd (Fig. 11 t )
has brushed fields separated by a vertical band of punctuations.
(d) PINELAND PUNCTATED-INCISED (Jelks, 1965) : 3 sherds, apparently derived from the same vessel, have a band on the upper body
decorated with alternating fields of para!lel diagonal incised lines and
punctate-filled triangles (Fig. 11 y, z). They are bone-tempered with
some salad.

(e) BI~OADDUS BRUSrIED (Jelks 1965) : 7 sherds, all bone-tempered
and reddish-buff in color, have brushed roughening of the external surfaces (Fig. 11 aa-cc). The brushing is vertical on 4 sherds, diagonal
on one, and in two different directions on the other two, which apparently derive from the same vessel. These sherds seem to fit the description of Broaddus Brushed type more nearly than that of Karnack
Brushed-Incised type.
(f) DIACONAL INCISED I~IM SI~RDS: 3 sherds (Fig. llu, v) from
two sand-tempered vessels are parts of outflaring rims which were
broken at the rim-body junction. They are decorated with alternating
bands of right and left sloping diagonal lines which have undecorated
triangles between the fields of incisions. The incised lines are made
with a notched or two-pronged tool, so that each incision is double,
with 1 mm. distance between the lines. The vessel shape and decoration arrangement are similar to Pineland Punctated-Ineised type,
which sometimes is sand-tempered.
(g) PLAIN SrIERDS: 42 sherds seem to derive from the bodies of
bottles, carinated bowls and jars, which have typical Caddoan shapes.
There are two rim sherds of open earinated bowls: one black in color
and clay-tempered, the other (Fig. 11 x) reddish-buff, bone-tempered,
and with diagonal notches across the lip of an otherwise undecorated
narrow rim. Seven sherds derive from sherd-tempered bowls, made of
soft, reddish paste which is similar to that of some of the Davis Incised
sherds. Some of these sherds may derive from the Davis vessels, but
two have undecorated rims. Of the remaining 33 sherds; 9 are polished, black clay-tempered sherds which appear to come from bottles

THE

and bowls (3 or 4 possibly derive from the same vessel); 5 are body
sherds from a large plain bottle of brown clay-tempered ware; and
the remaining 12 (1 bone-tempered and 11 clay-tempered) are from
diverse vessels, which are thin and have paste characteristics or indicated shapes of Caddoan vessels.
5. UNTYPED POTTERY SHEIqDS

Extraction of the above identified pottery sherds leaves a large
mass of unidentified sherds as follows: 348 sand-tempered or predominantly sand-tempered sherds, of which 14 are decorated and 21
are plain rim sherds, (2 of the latter are notched); 557 bone-tempered
sherds, of which 38 form Vessel 4, 19 are decorated and 18 are plain
rim sherds, one of which has diagonal notching; 418 clay-tempered
sherds, of which 11 are decorated and 36 are plain rim sherds, one of
which is notched. Out of these there are 5 aggregations of sherds
which deserve special attention because they can be assembled to the
point of giving a good indication of size, shape and/or decoration.
(a) VESSEL 4 AND 16 additional sherds are bone-tempered and
decorated with deeply trailed incised lines. Vessel 4 (Fig. 8 a) is a
large deep urn of "flower pot" shape, heavily bone-tempered, with
orange to red-brown surface color, except for small areas of black
h’om irregular firing. It measures 25-26 era. in height, 23-24 era. in
orifice diameter and 9.5 cm. in diameter of the fiat disc base. The lips
are flat, 7 ram. in thickness, the body walls are 8-9.5 ram. thick and the
base is 14 ram. thick. The decorated rim is set off from the body by
two parallel and horizontal deeply trailed lines, 1 cm. apart, and the
decorated rim is 7 cm. high. The decoration is effeeted with trailed
lines and punctations, the lines 2.5 to 3 mm. wide and 1-1.5 ram.
deep. The punctations were done with a serrated tool. There are 14
decorative units around the rim, each a triangular area, alternately
upright or pendant, filled with 4 to 6 diagonal lines each, except for
the left angle of the base, which has a punctate-filled small triangular
or semilunar area.
The 13 additional bone-tempered sherds have combinations of similar deep trailing. They are 7 to 9 ram. thick and most of the bone
temper has been dissolved, leaving vacuoles (Fig. 7 a-e). There are
no rim sherds and it is impossible to judge the vessel shape, although
the curvatures suggest diameters similar to or slightly smaller than
Vessel 4. Three other sherds have a like kind of trailing, but arranged
in curvilinear patterns (Fig. 7 i-l).
In many respects, Vessel 4 and this group of sherds resemble Canton
Incised type (Texas Handbook, 1962:23), because of the shape, the
band of decoration around the rfln, the combination of incised di-

42

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

agonal lines and punctations, and of varyingly directed lines. They
differ, however, in that Canton Incised is most often clay-grit-tempered, with bone sometimes added, whereas all of the tlesch sherds
of this type are bone-tempered. More important is the incising and
punctating with a pointed tool in Canton, whereas the Resch sherds
are heavily and deeply trailed, very similar to the trailing of the Marksville sherds at this site. Another consideration as to typology is Pineland Punctated-Incised (Jetks 1965) of the McGee Bend ceramics,
which has similar urn shapes and vessel sizes, but the same objections
prevail. It seems probable that this bone-tempered ineised-punetated
ware at Itesch is older than Canton and Pineland types and ancestral
to them; we therefore suggest the tentative type Canton Incised,
variety darco, for this ware.
(b) The vessel represented by the 4 sand-tempered sherds of
Fig. 6 g, h is of considerable interest. This is a small jar, apparently
smaller than Vessel 2, with thick walls (8-11 mm.) and flat lip. The
profile shows an indentation below the rim, with recurved walls, so
that the size and shape are quite consistent with Marksville pottery.
The decoration is unlike anything in Caddoan ceramics and its nearest
comparison is with Marksvilte Incised at the Crooks Site (Ford and
Willey, 1940 Fig. 35 e), in which varying combinations of concentric
circles, rectangles, diamonds and other rectilinear and curvilinear
motifs appear. The rim punctations in the tleseh vessel are nail
executed instead of hemiconical tool punctations, and the incised
lines are somewhat rougher; the sandy paste has a different texture
and feel from Marksville ceramics, including the Marksville Stamped
sherds at Besch. Some of the latter, however, have the same brown
eolor as this vessel and have more sand in the paste than is usual in
the Mississippi Valley. We suspect, therefore, that this vessel is an
East Texas variant, in sand-tempered paste, of Marksville Incised type.
(c) The 14 plain sherds which seem to derive from one vessel
were described under sand-tempered pottery. They show no other
tempering material, are ahnost sandstone-like in gritty consistency, and
the vessel form suggested by the six sherds which fit together is an
open vase with flat or slightly convex base ( Fig. 6 b ). The size appears
to be about that of Vessel 2. Other sherds, including 6 direct or
slightly incurving rims (Fig. 6 i) are similar. This ware is probably
related to or identical with Bockport Plain of the Texas Coast or Bear
Creek Plain of the Brookeland Focus in McGee Bend area (Jelks

1965).
(d) A group of 40 plain sherds, S of which are rim sherds comes
from 2 or 3 similar large vessels. Thirty of these have been fitted to-

THE

RESCH

SITE

43

gether into 3 vessels segments (Fig. 6 a, c, d). This is dark brown to
black sand-bone-hematite pottery which we call "ironware." The
vessel form is a "flowerpot" vase or deep bowl similar to vessel 4. It is
larger and has a wider orifice that is estimated to be 30-35 cm. in
diameter.
(e) Another large group of plain bone-tempered sherds, 12-15 of
which come fi’om one vessel, seems to derive from vessel forms very
similar to the above group and to Vessel 4. A much smaller group
of preponderantly clay-tempered plain sherds, including some rim
sherds, probably represents similar large vessels of open vase form.
Many of these sherds have a mixture of tempering materials, more
often bone and grit, but additional amounts of crushed sherd or clay
particles and hematite or ocher are not infrequent.
Among the remaining plain sherds, judging especially from rims,
smaller cylindrical jars like Vessel 2, deep bowls and wider bowls with
incurvate rims and constricted orifices, like Vessel 3 are indicated.
These include sherds of all three major tempering characteristics,
some with multiple temper. The majority of these vessels have relatively thick walls, in the 7 to 9 ram. range. The rims are typically
unaltered, except for occasional thinning, and the lips are most often
rounded but are fiat in some instances, with occasional notching. The
afiqliation of most of these plain, thick-walled vessels of groups d and e
is probably with Woodward Plain type.
Some of the plain sherds undoubtedly derive from the undecorated
portions of decorated vessels, but the large proportion of plain rims
indicates that many of the vessels were plain. Some of the thinner
sherds, especially in the clay-tempered plain, possibly represent vessels
from the Co/es Creek and Caddoan periods, but do not have paste
characteristics by which this can be determined with certainty.
Untyped Decorated Sherds: There are 23 untyped decorated
sherds, 9 with sandy paste, 3 bone-tempered and 11 clay-tempered.
Six small sandy sherds are from one incised vessel (Fig. 6 k). Eight
others, mostly small fragments, have incisions. Three bone-tempered
(Fig. 7 f-h) and 2 clay-tempered (Fig. 7 r) sherds are thick and have
random punctations, 3 with the fingernail and 2 with tools. They
resemble Wilkinson Punctated type of Louisiana and East Texas.
Two thinner sherds have small tool punetations which seem to be
random, but the sherds are small. The final two sherds (Fig. 7 t) from
the same vessel are light and porous, as though tempered with vegetal
matter which fired out. They have a decoration of vertical incised
bands centered by a line of punctation.

C. OTHER CLAY OBJECTS.

Objects of clay, other than ceramics, are extremely rare. There
are 5 small fragments of daub, which have impressions of twigs or
grass on the surfaces. There is one small object of pinkish clay with
smooth surfaces, 4 x 3.5 x 3 cm., with trapezoidal cross-section.
Finally, there are 5 pieces of mud-dauber nests of sandy clay.
D.

PROJECTILE POINTS

There are 512 projectile points from this site, all but two derived
from the excavations. Of this group, 464 are considered to be dart
points, 48 arrow points and one lance point. The outstanding characteristics of the projectiles are: relatively small size, poor quality of
manufacture, and preponderant use of local materials. Of the dart
points 195 (42.0377), and of the arrow points, 15 (31.9.57o) were made
of petrified wood; 208 (44.8377) of the dart points and 9.9 (60.4277) of
the arrow points were made from local cherts which are largely tan,
red, brown and gray pebble cherts. Only 61 (13.147o) of the dart
points and 4 (8.337o) of the arrow points were made from materials
which seem to be foreign to the area. Of these, 19 are novaculites
and quartzites, probably from the Hot Springs, Arkansas locality. A
mottled dark flint and several shades of light gray waxy chert, both
thought to derive from central Texas, are next in frequency of materials presumed to be exotic in origin. Others are in small numbers
and the source is uncertain. Thirty-seven of the dart points are broken
in a way that prevents typing.
i.

DART PROJECTILE

POINTS

(a) CABY TYPE: The Gary type (Fig. 12) makes up the majority
of the dart points, 9’76 (64.637o) of the 49.7 typed points. In size, 9.9 of
these are Gary Typical (Ford and Webb 1956), 4.6 to 6.6 era. in
length, 1.7 to 3.7 era. in width and 7.3 and 19. ram. thick. Of the Gary
Typical, 19 were made of petrified wood, 6 of tan and 9’ of brown local
cherts, 1 of white flint and 1 of white quartzite. Some 169’ are Gary
Small, with lengths between 3.1 and 4.5 era., widths from 1.3 to 3.4 cm.,
and thicknesses from 6 to !3 ram. Of the Gary Small, 65 were made of
petrified wood; 61 of tan, 15 of red-brown and 4 of gray local cherts.
Seventeen Gary Small were made of foreign materials; 9’ of white
chert, 1 of black chert, 3 of mottled gray glint, 5 of lighter waxy flint
and 6 of quartzites. There are 6 tiny Garys which, following MacNeish
(1967), we have called GmTito. These are 9’.1 to 3 em. in length,
1.1 to 9’.9 era. in width and 4 to 9.3 mm. in thickness. Only 19’ of the
66 were made of petrified wood, in comparison with 35 of tan chert,
10 of gray chert, and one of hematite. Eight are of foreign materials,

5 of quartzite, 2 of light cream chert and 1 of Central Texas gray
chert. Of the Gary points, 19 are broken to the extent that nieasurements of length can not be obtained; 11 of these are of petrified wood,
4 of tan, 1 of cream and 9. of gray local cherts, and 1 of novaeulite.
Contracting stem points constitute the major projectile point shape
in Late Archaic and early pottery complexes in East Texas and northern Louisiana. Distribution studies at the Yarbrough and Miller sites
(Johnson 1969,) indicated a progressive shift during the Archaic
period from side-notched and expanded-base traditions to straight
stems and, in Late Archaic times, to the contracting stem tradition.
The latter has been expressed in types Gary, Wells, Desmuke and, to
some extent, in sub-varieties of Kent and the new type, Woden, introduced by Jelks (1965) in describing the McGee Bend material. A
tendency for Gary type points to diminish in size with the passage of
time was described by Baerreis (1951) for the preeeramic cultures
of Eastern Oklahoma and by Ford and Webb (1956) for northern
Louisiana. More recently, attention has been directed to the overall
morphology of Gary points, as reviewed by MeClurkan in a recent
publication (1968). A number of varieties or subtypes were established by Duffleld (1961) at the Limerick Site, by Johnson (1962)
at Yarbrough and Miller Sites, by Ross (1966) at the Forney l~eservoir Sites, by Sorrow (1966) from Bardwell l~eservoir, and by McClurkan (1968) from Livingston Reservoir Sites. All of the above
sites are in eastern or north central Texas. These authors recognized
seven to fifteen varieties of Gary type from the sites or areas which
they studied. Story (1965) used the Johnson classification in description of artifacts from the Cedar Creek Reservoir, which is in the
Trinity River drainage of East Texas and west of the l:(esch Site.
Table 4 shows the frequency of Johnson’s varieties of Gary type at
the t~esch Site. We have chosen his classification because the Yarbrough Site is in the same drainage system as the l~esch Site and
because the application of variety names makes for easier comparisons.
The kaufman variety (Fig. 12 a-h) was popular at the l~esch Site, with
a total of 47, or 17.037o of all Gary points. Ten of the 27 Gary Typical
(between 5 and 8 cm. in length) are of this variety, whereas only
4 of the tiny Garys are. This corresponds with the observation elsewhere that kaufman tends to be larger than other varieties of Gary
type in East Texas. It is characterized by wide triangular blades,
distinct shoulders and triangular, pointed stems.
The alsa variety, another larger point with triangular blade but with
wider stems and indistinct shoulders, and the similar but smaller
kenedg variety are missing at the Resch Site. The hobson variety (Fig.

12 i-n) tends to be small. Five of the 11 specimens are Garyito or tiny
Garys and 5 are small Garys, between 3.1 and 4.5 era. in length. These
have wide, rounded stems and are rather well made.
The emory variety of Gary point (Fig. 12 o, t, v, w) is the most
numerous at Resch Site, with a total of 96 points (34.78~o of all Gary
points). Thirty-three of the emory variety are tiny Garys (less than
3 cm. in length), 57 are Gary Small and only 4 are GalT Typical.
Emory variety tends to be slender, with a contracting stem which has
a straight instead of pointed base. There are distinct shoulders (Fig.
12 o, p, s, v, w) on 46 of the emory variety, while 50 are more slender,
with only a suggestion of a shoulder. This trait is especially pronounced in the Garyito size. Johnson’s illustration from the Yarbrough
Site (Johnson 1962, Fig. 4) also demonstrates narrower and wider
forms in this variety.
The runge variety, with long narrow stems and short blades (Fig.
12x-aa), is represented by 11 specimens at Resch: one tiny, 7 small
and 1 typical size, with 2 broken. The parma maria variety is even
less numerous, only 6 specimens. Two of these are small and 4
typical in size. They tend to be rough, thick, with indistinct and
slender outline (Fig. 12 bb).
The kemp variety (Fig. 12 cc-ii) is second in frequency among the
Gary points from t~esch, a total of 67 (24.27~). Twenty-two of these
are tiny, 39 are Gary Small, and 6 are Gary Typical. These are slender
points, better made than most of the Gary varieties, with long triangular blade and triangular pointed stem. There is the same dichotomy as in emory variety between specimens with slightly wider
blades and distinct shoulders, and specimens with narrower blades

48

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

and barely discernible shoulders. Thirty-eight of kemp variety have
distinct shoulders (Fig. 12 co, ff-hh) and 29 have indistinct.
The colfax variety (Fig. 12 jj-nn) is represented by 18 specimens,
only two of which are tiny Garys; most of the specimens are Gary
Small in size. They have comparatively short blades, the edges of
which are generally convex instead of straight. The stems tend to be
nearer straight-sided than most Gary points, although rounded at
the base. Except for the tendency to small size, this variety is easily
confused with the quinlan variety of Kent type, as shown in Johnson’s
(1962) Fig. 5 i, j.
Twenty Gary points from this site do not fall into any of these
varieties. Twelve (Fig. 12 pp) are similar to als(l variety, having wide
triangular blades with rough chipping, but the stems differ in being
narrow and short, ahnost "nubbin" like in size. All of these are small.
Two points are modified leaf-shaped (Fig. 12u) with convex edge
blades and gracefully rounded stems. The remainder are nondescript,
and several are altered by breakage.
(b) WELLS TYPE: Only 5 projectiles are classified as Wells type
(Fig. 13 a-c) using the major criterion that the contracting stems
constitute 55 to 6770 of the total point length. They are 3 to 4.3 cm. in
length, 1.6 to 2.6 era. in width and 8-9 ram. in thickness (smaller than
listed in the Suhm and Jelks (1962) Handbook, as are most of the
projectiles from this site). Four are fairly well made, one rough. The
materials from which they were manufactured are: one each from
local gray chert, light gray Central Texas chert, sandy quartzite, petrified wood and waxy gray flint. Two points are distinctive in having
relatively long stems and very short, small isosceles triangular blades
(Fig. 13 b).
(C) DESlVIUKE TYPE: There are 6 points which we classify as
Desmuke type (Fig. 13 d-f) with some hesitation, because it appears
that the lozenge-shaped projectile points which occur from Oklahoma
and East Texas across northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas to
the MississiDpi Valley, although internally consistent and closely
resembling Desmuke points, do not equate in all respects with the
Desmuke point which was described (Suhm and Krieger 1954; Suhm
and Jelks 1969,) from southwestern Texas. The bases tend to be relatively longer and the blade edges are more often mildly convex than
in the original descriptions. If anyone would Drefer to classify our
specimens as a variety of Gary point, we would have no quarrel. The
senior author has noted, at a number of sites in northern Louisiana
and especially at the Poverty Point site and other sites of this complex, that Gary points are often of foreign materials, especially novacu-

lite and quartzites from the Hot Springs area. At these same sites the
lozenge-shaped Desmuke-like points share this use of quartzites,
indicating that this point is a companion or variant of the Gary type.
The 6 Desmuke points are 3.4 to 4.4 cm. in length, 2 to 2.8 era. in
width and 8-12 mm. thick. They are slightly crude, with large flake
scars and minimal edge retouch; 4 show central longitudinal ridges
on one or both faces. Different materials are represented by 3 points of
local buff, tan or red chert, one of petrified wood, one of novaculite
and one of brown foreign chert.
(d) KENT TYPE: 42 projectile points (9.83% of the dart points)
are classified as Kent (Fig. 13 j-l), which is third in frequency at the
site. Of these, 38 are slender in outline, while 9 are of moderate width
in proportion to length. Most show evidences of carelessness in manufacture, with large flake scars, minimal edge retouch, asymmetrical
stems or shoulders, and often with thick ridges on one face. Half of
them show residual cortex at the base or on the faces. The lengths vary
from 3 to 5.7 cm., the widths from 1.6 to 3 cm., and the thicknesses
fi’om 6.5 to 19..4 ram. Almost all are made of local materials, petrified wood in 26 instances, tan or gray local chert in 14. The two possibly foreign materials represented are one point of black and one of
reddish chert.
(e) ELAZV~ TYPE: 8 specimens (Fig. 13 g-i) are small, short and
stubby in outline, with triangular blades and square or rectangular
stems. Four of these have distinct shoulders and in outline are similar
to Carrollton type, but their small size and the absence of smooth
stem edges fit better into the Elam type. Three of the points show
some smoothing of the stem bases. They range from 3 to 3.8 cm. in
length, from 1.9 to 9..6 cm. in width and are 6.5 to 9 ram. thick. Materials are petrified wood in four instances, local cream, gray or tan
chert in three, and Central Texas gray mottled chert in one.
(~) PALMILLAS TYPE: 16 specimens (Fig. 13 m-o), 4 of which are
moderately short and wide, while the other 12 tend to be slender.
They are more carefully made than the Kent points, averaging about
like the Gary type, with edge retouch on most blades. The production of the bulbous stem resulted in distinct, usually squared shoulders, without barbs. Lengths vary from 3.7 to 6.5 cm., widths are 1.8
to 2.8 cm., and thicknesses 6 to 11 ram. Materials are mostly local:
petrified wood in 8, tan chert in 4, brown and gray chert in one each.
A white chert and a gray quartzite may be from Arkansas.
(g) YAItBI:IOUGH TYPE:
15
specimens (Fig. 13 x-aa) are subdivided into varieties as outlined by Johnson (1962). All are slender
points with long triangular blades, with straight or mildly convex

THE RESCH SITE

51

edges and with mildly expanding or ahnost straight stems. Moderate
shoulders were produced by the long, curving notches; no barbs are
present. The stems show smoothing of the edges and bases in most
instances, but this is less evident in those points made of petrified
wood. Several of the Yarbrough points are very well made (Fig. 13 x),
but most exhibit only average technology, about like the Palmillas and
Gary points at this site.
Yarbrough type, dike variety: 3 specimens (Fig. 13x-z). These
are the largest of the Yarbrough type from this site. They are 5.3 to
6.3 cm. in length, 2.1 to 9..6 em. in width and 7.5 to 9 ram. in thickness. The stem edges are distinctly concave and the bases straight.
Stem edges and bases are ground smooth. Materials are petrified
wood, buff local chert and Central Texas mottled waxy chert.
Yarbrough type, lindale variety: 11 specimens. These are smaller
in size and more slender in outline. Five are broken and the remainder
vary from 3.5 to 4.8 em. in length, 1.8 to 2.5 cm. in width, and 8 to
10 mm. in thickness. They are not as well made as the dike variety, and
in 4 of the 11 specimens stem smoothing is not manifest. The stem
expansion is less than in the dike variety, with strong concavity only
at the upper part of the notch, so that some stems are almost straight.
The latter could be confused with Kent points and are separated on
the basis of general outline or stem smoothing. Materials are petrified wood in 8 instances, light gray or tan local chert in two, and gray
siltstone in one.
Yarbrough type, mabank variety: one specimen (Fig. 13 aa). This
point of local tan chert has the typical concave edge and concave base
of this variety, although the stem is straighter than usual. Stem edges
and base are well ground. The tip is broken, but the probable length
is 4.5 cm., the width 2.2 em. and thickness 7.5 mm.
(h) YANTIS TYPE: 9, specimens fit the type Yantis (Fig. 13p, q),
as established by Johnson (1962) at the Yarbrough Site. They are
large and crude, both broken across the blade, and are characterized
additionally by wide concave side or corner notching and straight
bases, with slight stem edge smoothing. One seems to fit the cook
variety of Yantis; the concave notches expand to produce a wide,
straight base. It is made of peh’ified wood. The second appears to be
a swan variety of Yantis, with wide blade, deep concave notches and
a straight base. It is made of a dull red petrified wood. The stem sides
and bases of both specimens are smoothed.
(i) ELLIS TYPE (Fig. 13 r-w): 45 specimens represent 10.54% of
the typed dart points, making this type second in frequency at the
site, after Gary. About ~ of the specimens are nicely worked, the

52

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

remainder rather crude. They have about the appearance of most
points of this type from east Texas and northwestern Louisiana: a
slightly small and stubby projectile, with distinct, usually squared
shoulders, rarely barbed (3 of the 44 at this site), with corner notching which produced expanded stems. The stem bases are most often
straight, oecasiona!ly slightly convex or, less often, concave. Ten
points are broken. Of the remainder, 7 are more slender than is usual
for this type. The range of length is 9,.6 to 4.4 cm., the width 1.5 to
9..9 em., the thickness 4.6 to 11 mm. The consistency of size is indicated by the fact that 26 of the 35 intact points are between 3 and 4
cm. in length. One specimen with typical stem and lower blade has
been resharpened to form a hafted scraper. Most of the materials
from which these points were made are loeah 13 of petrified wood,
20 of tan chert, 6 of red, brown or gray local cherts. Exotic materials
include 1 of novaeulite, 2 of mottled Central Texas gray chert, and 3
of gray flint of unknown source .
(j) BULVEItDE TYPE: One well-made point of greenish-gray flint,
possibly of Central Texas origin, seems to be typical Bulverde type
(Fig. 14 bb). The length is 6.2 era., the width 3.9 era. and the thickness 10 ram. The blade is a straight-sided triangle; the shoulders
are squared without barbs, and the stem is rectangular and wedgeshaped in profile.
(k) DELHI TYPE: One beautifully flaked and symmetrically made
large projectile is of the type known from the Poverty Point culture
(Ford and Webb 1956) as Delhi (Fig. 14 aa). It is made of a waxy
black flint, possibly Webbers Falls argillite. The b!ade is long and
leaf-shaped, with fine retouch flaking along the edges, ending in
short barbs at the shoulders. The stem is slightly expanded, almost
rectangular, with a straight and thinned base. The stem edges and
base are smoothed. It is 9.6 cm. long, 9..8 cm. wide at the shoulders,
and only 7 ram. in maximum thickness.
(1) SINNER TYPE (Fig. 14 y): One small slender point of tan
chert is of the type which ttiram Gregory and the senior author have
called Sinner type. It is related to the Evans type, a larger point with
a single deep notch in the side of the blade, found in Arkansas and
northern Louisiana in Late Archaic context (Ford and Webb 1956;
Bell 1958:24). The Sinner type has multiple deep notches in the lower
blade edges, numbering 9. to 5, and often varying in number on the
two edges of a single point. Bases are squared to slightly expanded.
The point is generally slender and often rough. The specimen from
this site (Fig. 14 y) meets all of these criteria; there are three notches
in one blade margin, none or possibly one (broken) on the other;

the stem is square and asymmetrica!, and the workmanship is poor.
Dimensions are: length 4.5 cm.; width 1.7 cm.; thickness 9 ram.
(m) TRINITY TYPE: 1 broken point (Fig. 13 ce) has the stem and
lower blade which show the characteristic high shallow side notches
that produce a wide bulbous stem. It is made of an exotic gray "flint.
The width is 2.1 cm., the length is not known.
(n) UNTYPED POINTS: There are 8 entire or ahnost whole points
that do not fit established types with certainty and will be described.
Additionally there are 37 broken points or fi’agments in which the
breakage prevents typing. The latter include 16 of petrified wood, 9
of tan chert, 4 of novaculite or quartzites which probably derived
from the Arkansas Ozarks, one of white chert, and 7 of light or dark
gray waxy cherts or flints that are probably of Central Texas origin.
Three small and slender points (Fig. 14 cc, dd) are similar to the
Bradley and Flint River spikes described in Alabama (DeJarnette,
Kurjack and Cambron 1962). They are slender leaf-shaped, with
barely discernible basal narrowing and straight bases; they do not
have the appearance of drills. Two are made of black and reddishbrown petrified wood. The third is a speckled gray flint from Central
Texas and is small lanceolate (Fig. 14 cc) in outline, but the edges
and base are not ground.
Three points of petrified wood (Fig. 14 x) are small and have wide,
leaf-shaped blades with carefully worked, smal! projecting tips; weak
shoulders and square stems with straight bases. They are 3.2 to 4.3
cm. in length, 2.1 to 2.7 cnI. in width and 4 to 8.5 ram. in thickness.
One point of petrified wood has the square stem and deep basal
notches to produce long, sweeping barbs that are characteristic of
Marshall type (Fig. 13 bb). The blade is properly wide, with barbed
shoulders, but the point is much thinner than usual for this type (4.4
ram.) and the blade has been worked into an end scraper.
A large point (Fig. 14 z) made of granular quartzite ("sugar
quartz"), with wide leaf shape, has weak shoulders and either a
narrow straight stem or a contracting stem. It may be Gary or Yantis
type. The uncertainty exists because of a diagonal break across one
shoulder.
An interesting fragment is the snapped-off basal segment of a
concave-base point (Fig. 13 dd) of light gray waxy chert. It has the
appearance of a lanceolate point base, with smooth base and edges,
and with thinning of the concave base but no fluting.
2. POSSIBLE LANCE PROJECTILE POINT

There is one long projectile point (Fig. 14 ee) that is difficult to
classify. It is a slender bayonet-shaped point of petrified wood, with

THE

a rough and asymmetrical stem, a sharp tip, roughly finished edges
and smoothly rounded unridged faces. It is 12.3 cm. long, 2.2 cm. wide
at the shoulder, and 9 to 11 ram. thick. The stem is 1.8 to 2.2 cm. long.
O.

ARROW PROJECTILE POINTS

There are 48 whole or fragmentary small and thin points that are
classified as arrow projectile points. Although nearly half of them had
tips or barbs broken off, all but four could be typed satisfactorily.
(a) FI:~ILEY TYPE: 29. specimens (Fig. 14a-h) make up exactly
half of the typed arrow points. These are fragile points, and 13 of the
9.9. were broken somewhere, usually at the outward or upward projetting barb. Ten of the specimens have the unique characteristic of
an upward projecting barb from one or both shoulders. Four otherwise typical points have barbs that project straight out from the
shoulder, and in the remainder the barbs are broken off. Stems are
expanded in 11 instances, rectangular in 9 and uncertain in the remainder. Blades are serrated in 19. instances and relatively smooth in
the others. Lengths range from 19. to 28 mm., widths from 19. to 17
mm., and thicknesses from 9. to 4 mm. Eleven of the points were made
of petrified wood, 11 of tan, red and gray local cherts.
(b) COLBERT TYPE (Fig. 14 q-u): 10 of the arrow points are of
Colbert type (Webb 1963). These points are related to Seallorn type
but have shorter and relatively wider blades, often with concave edges
to produce a flare above the shoulder. The low corner notching produced expanded, often slightly bulbous, stems and straight or mildly
barbed shoulders. Lengths vary from 14 to 31 ram., widths from 12 to
19 mm., and thicknesses from 9..8 to 4.6 ram. Two of these points are
of petrified wood, 7 of local tan and red cherts, and one of quartzite.
(c) ALBA TYPE (Fig. 14 i-k): 3 points, two of local tan and one
of green waxy chert, are of Alba type. They are symmetrical and wellmade, with straight-sided triangular blades and rectangular stems:
shoulders are straight and unbarbed. Lengths vary from 20 to 30 ram.,
widths from 19. to 18 ram., and thicknesses from 4 to 5 mm.
(d) BONHAM TYPE (Fig. 14 1, m): 3 specimens made of tan,
cream and gray waxy cherts resemble the Alba points, but the smaller
size and narrow rectangular stems place them into Bonham type.
Lengths are from 9.3 to 9.5 ram., widths from 11 to 17 ram., and thicknesses are 3.6 to 4 ram.
(e) CLn~FTON TYPE (Fig. 14 n, o): 9. specimens, of tan and red
local cherts, have the typica! triangular blades and short, poorly developed, rounded stems of this type. They are 9.9. and 9.3 mm. in
length, 17 and 18 ram. in width, and 4.5 and 5 ram. in thickness. One
differs in having a projecting shoulder on one side.

CATAHOULA

TYPE (Fig. 14 p): 2 specimens made of re:l

jasper and tan chert have the synnnetrical shape, recurred blade
edges, wide barbs and expanded stems which characterize this type.
They are the most carefully made of the arrow points from this site.
The larger point is 40 mm. in length, 23 mm. wide, and 4.5 mm.
thick. The smaller one, which has a broken tip, is 20 ram. wide and 3
ram. thick.

I)OINTS:

Two small points (Fig. 14

v, w) have the ovate or leaf-shaped outline of Nodena type but are
thicker and shorter than is usual for this type. One of petrified wood
is 30 ram. long, 14 ram. wide and 6 ram. thick. The other, of gray lint,
is 9.3 ram. long, 14 mm. wide and 7.5 ram. thick.
There are 4 broken and untyped arrow points, probably Friley type.
Three were made of local gray, tan and red cherts; one of petrified
wood.

E.

CHIPPED STONE

TOOLS

The difficulties which the classifier faces with chipped stone tools
from East Texas sites have been recounted by Story (1965), Johnson
(1962), Jelks (1965) and others. Our experience is no different. At the
l~esch Site these objects are numerous, even though the major part of
the occupation was in the post-Archaic pottery-making periods. The
tools are made of petrified wood and small chert or quartzite pebbles
which exhibit poor textural qualities. The objects, moreover, seem to
have been made hurriedly and carelessly by percussion flaking. Few of
them show evidence of prolonged use or repeated resharpening, suggesting the custom of fashioning them hurriedly as needed or discarding or losing them often. We have followed the usual cusom of classifying these objects on the basis of shape, size and location of the
knapping scars by which they were prepared. Certain groupings are
suggested by the physical appearance or by the location of the presumed functional area, and in these instances we have followed the
typology established by the above authors, in addition to that of Tunnell ( 1961 ), Davis and Davis (1960) and Dut~eld (1961).
1. THIN BIFACIAL TOOLS. These are chipped tools of relative thinness,
sometimes called knives or blades. A preference was manifested :~or
thin slabs or sheets of petrified wood, often showing some of the
original cortex on one or both faces. Otherwise materials are local
cherts, occasional quartzites or slabs of hematite. The petrified wood
was probably favored for these presumed cutting instruments because
of the natural tendency to cleave in longitudinal spalls which easily
produced a long sharp edge. There are 85 thin bifacials from the site.

thin rectangles of petrifed wood, with each end showing unaltered
cortex, the faces flat and unworked, and with functional sharp edges.
Seven of the 13 have cutting edges bilaterally, 6 unilaterally with the
opposite edge rounded or unaltered. One specimen has a longitudinal
central ridge, and 5 specimens are slightly thicker than the typical
tool, with one face flat and the opposite slightly convex. Lengths vary
from 3.5 to 11.2 era., widths from 9,.4 to 4.5 cm., and thicknesses are
5 to 9 ram. in the 7 typical specimens, 10 to 13.5 ram. in the thicker
ones.

(b) POINTED

SLABS

(Fig.

15 k, 1) : 12 specimens (all petrified

wood) are flat objects with straight, unaltered bases and gently incurving sharp edges which meet in a point, producing a long ovate outline. The faces show only enough modification to make them fairly
flat and smootlL The dimensions are rather uniform; the lengths vary
from 4.2 to 6.4 era., widths 2.2 to 3.1 era., and thicknesses of 7 to 10.4
ram. in the typical forms. Five specimens are piano-convex and
thicker, varying from 11 to 15 mm.
(c) OVAL reFACES (Fig. 15 a, b) : 5 specimens, 9. of petrified
wood, 9. of tan chert, one of quartzite. These are small, thin, circular
or oval bifaeially-ehipped objects, with thinned edges around the complete periphery or lacking finish in only a small arc. The maximum
diameters vary from 2.8 to 4 era., and the thicknesses from 6.2 to

19, mm.
(d)

FLAT

OVAL BIEACES (Fig. 15 o, p): 4 specimens, 9, intact, 2

broken. These are similar to the rectangular slabs and are made of
flat sheets of petrified wood with smooth faces and fine chipping to
produce a sharp edge around the entire circumference. Measurements of the two intact specimens are 6 by 4 cm. and 4.8 by 3.5 era.;
the broken specimens are 3.1 and 4.7 era. wide; thicknesses vary from
3 to 7 ram.
(e) LAI~CE OVATE BIFACES (Fig. 15 i, j): 4 specimens, 3 of petrified wood, and one of brown hematite. They are long ovate elliptical or
pear-shaped, thicker at the basal end. Three are worked around the
entire periphery and one shows a small area of cortex at the base.
The chipping is rough in 3 of the specimens, but one object of petrified wood (Fig. 15 j) is nicely shaped, with sharp edges. Lengths
range from 5.7 to 7.9 crn., widths from 9~.3 to 3.4 era., and thicknesses
from 8.5 to 19,.8 ram.
(f) S1VIALL OVATE BIFACES (Fig. 15 e, f) : 19, specimens, similar
in outline but smaller than the above. The piece is chipped all around
the edges in 9 instances, with a small amount of cortex at two bases.
Chipping is biracial with little, if any original surfaces on the bases.

THE

RESCH

SITE

59

Six of these objects are of petrified wood, 5 of tan chert, 1 of tan
quartzite. Lengths vary from 3.8 to 5 era., widths from 1.9 to 2.8 era.,
and thicknesses from 6.2 to 12.3 mm.
( g ) TRIANCULAR TO SUB-TRIANGULAR BIFACES
( Fig. 15 c, d ) : 9
specimens which are similar in execution to the ovate blades but
differ in having a triangular shape. They also resemble the pointed
slabs in shape but are smaller, and the peripheral thinning includes
the base. Seven of these blades are made of petrified wood, one of
hematite and one of gray granular chert. Lengths are 3.4 to 4.6 cm.,
widths 2 to 3.1 cm., thicknesses from 6 to 10 mm.
(h) STEMMED BIFACES (Fig. 15 g, h) : Seven specimens are ovate
or slightly elongate and differ by having a stem for hafting. The
rounded or unworked tips make it unlikely that they were projectiles
in fact, 4 of the 6 have original cortex at the distal end. The edges
are chipped by percussion with no evidence of pressure flaking. One
of these tools has a diagonally directed and beveled edge, but the
blade edge is convex. The stems are straight or slightly contracting
and are short. Five of the objects are made of petrified wood, 9. of
tan chert. Lengths range from 3.9 to 5.9 era., widths from 1.8 to 3.2
cm., thicknesses from 7 to 11 mm.
(i)

BROKEN AND IRRECULAR THIN- TOOLS; 20

specimens are broken,

apparently derived from the above categoriesbut uncertain because of
breakage. A few may be complete tools but are rough and irregular
in shape. Thirteen of these objects are of petrified wood, 9, of tan
chert and 5 of quartzite.
2. THICKER CHIPPED BIFACES: These are much thicker and rougher
tools, and with a few exceptions, are even more difficult to categorize.
Many are made of petrified wood, but a higher percentage is from
other materials, mostly local cherts. The rough percussion chipping by
which they were shaped occurs bifacially. There are 255 tools in this
general grouping.
(a) ELONGATE BIFACIAL TOOLS (Fig. 16 a, b) : 54 specimens have
various modifications of ovate, leaf-shaped, rectangular, or lanceolate
outlines, but all are relatively narrow and elongate, with rough chipping on both faces and around the edges. Some could be confused
with or could have been used as projectiles, but as a group they have
more the appearance of cutting tools. Many have one face rather
flat, the other ridged, to give a triangular cross-section. Although
chipped all over, 9,1 show small remnants of the original pebble
cortex at one or both ends, and an equal number have traces on the
faces. Twelve have an angulated or crescentic outline (Fig. 16 b) and
most of these show a better cutting edge on the outer curve. One of

these objects has a graver-like tip, which may be fortuitous. Thirtysix of these objects are of petrified wood, 16 of tan or red local chert
and 9. of quartzite. The lengths range from 3.7 to 6.9 era., the widths
@ore 1.5 to 2.4 era., the thickensses from 5 to 15.5 nnn.
(b) ELONGATE END TOOLS (Fig. 16d, e): Eight specimens are
similarly long and narrow, usually rectangular in shape, and differ
in that the only cutting edge is at one end of the tool. All of these
objects are of petrified wood, and 6 of the 8 show no chipping except
at the tool end. The other two are roughly chipped to form the body
but have no thinned edges. The chisel-like end is usually silghtly
wider than the body and mildly curved. In two instances it is diagonally placed; it is not unifacia!, but is formed by bilateral percussion chipping and fine flaking. The bifacial slant is not steep, as in
end scrapers, but is at an acute, blade-like angle. Lengths range from
4.2 to 6.8 cm., widths from 1.4 to 2.5 at midbody and from 1.5 to 3 at
the blade end; thicknesses are from 8 to 15 nnn.
(0) Si~IALL
BIFACE
TOOLS,
oval, ovate-acuminate, rectanguloid
(Fig. 16 c): 90 specimens are small and relatively thick, rough bifacially worked objects. They are similar to the elongate bifacials
except for smaller size and relative breadth. The chipping is rough,
the edges are wavy and rarely show resharpening or pressure flaking,
and the ends may be rounded or pointed. Some of these also could
have been used as projectiles, but there is no basal thinning or stem
formation and the tips are often blunt. As noted of the elongate tools,
many show pebble cortex remnants on the ends or faces, and a general
piano-convex shape is not unusual. There are 23 of these made of
petrified wood, 52 of tan loca! chert, 12 of red chert or jasper, and 3
are of granular quartzite. The range of length is 2.8 to 5.1 cm., of
width 1.5 to 3.3 cm. and of thickness 7.5 to 15.5 mm. Most of this

group falls within the limits of 3 to 4.5 cm. in length.
(d) POINTED PEBBLE TOOLS (Fig. 16 f, g): 65 specimens are what
would be called "Perkin Pikes" by Jelks (1965). These are pebble
tools, with knobby bases of unaltered pebble cortex, and bifacial or
trifacial rough chipping down to rounded or pointed ends, which
must have been the functional part of the tool. A few were made from

large spalls which had been thrown off larger cobbles; the original
cortex appears on one face, with rough shaping on the other. The
shaping of the tools in some instances starts near the cortex base but
occasionally begins about the midpoint of the object. No use polish
has been detected. Fourteen of these objects are of petrified wood, 35
of tan chert, 4 of red-brown chert, 1 of hematite, 7 of red-brown cong!omerate quartzite, and 4 of rough gray granular quartzite. Lengths

62

range from 3.1 to 6.4 era., widths from 9..3 to 4.2 era. and thicknesses
from 9.5 to 27 mm.
(e) PEBBLE SInE-BLADES (Fig. 16 h, i): 14 specimens are similar
to pointed pebble tools, except that the pebble is oval or crescentic in
outline. The original
chipped-out blade on
the entire length of
resembles a segment
fairly well sharpened.

One of these tools is of petrified wood, 8 of tan

chert, one of gray chert, 2 of brown chert, and 2 of gray qualtzite.
The lengths range from 3.7 to 6 era., the width from 2.1 to 3.5 cm.,
and the thicknesses from 9 to 23 ram.
(f) OVATE "TURTLE-BACK" BIFACES

(Fig.

161) : 2 specimens are

irregularly oval in outline, bifaeially rough chipped, with one face
relatively flat or mildly convex, the other steeply chipped. The large
flake scars alternate at the edges to produce marked sinuosity of the
blade, with no secondary pressure flaking. One object is of petrified
wood, the other of tan chert. Dimensions are 5.5 by 3.9 by 2 cm. and
4 by 2.7 by 1.5 cm.
(g) CHIPPED PEBBLE CHOPPERS (Fig. 16 j) : 5 specimens are rectangular blocks, 4 of petrified wood and one of rough red granular
quartzite, unaltered except at one end to produce an irregular, rough
blade. The shaping was by percussion chipping, with no pressure
flaking or grinding. Hence the blade edges are irregular, although
an effective tool seems to have resulted. The blades are convex from
side to side, bifacially worked and equally sloped on the two faces.
They are moderately steep in three instances, less steep in two thinner
objects. Lengths are 5 to 7.5 cm., widths 3.3 to 5.2 em., and thicknesses 1.8 to 3.5 era.
(h) TWO ADDITIONAL TOOLS may belong with this group or may
be called chipped celts (Fig. 16 k). They are made of flat petrified
wood pebbles and have unaltered bases or polls and natural cortex
on both faces and on the basal half of both edges. From this position
on each edge, a rounded blade was produced by percussion chipping,
bifacially. Because of the thinness of the original pebble, the blade
bevel is not nearly so long and steep as in the previously described
tools; otherwise the idea is the same. Lengths are 5 and 4.4 cm., widths
4.1 and 3.5 cm., thicknesses 10 and 6.6 ram., respectively.
(i) IRREGULAR BIFACES, CORES AND REJECTS: There are 9 rough,
irregularly shaped, bifacially worked objects of medium size which
do not fit any of the above categories. Three are of petrified wood, 5
of tan chert and one of gray chert. Additionally there are 6 pebbles

THE

RESCH

SITE

of various sizes which show some percussion chipping but not enough
to call them tools. They may be unfnished tools, rejects or cores. One
is petrified wood, 3 are tan chert and 2 are rough granular quartzite.
3. THICK UNIFAClAL TOOLS: Three groups of tools, totalling 29 objects, relate to the thick bifaces in that they have considerable amounts
of pebble cortex on the surfaces, and show minimal rough percussion
chipping to form the tool; they differ in that they are unifacially
worked, the unworked face being flat.
(a) END SCItAPEItS ON SLABS (Fig. 17 a, b): 8 specimens fu!fill the
specifications established by Johnson (1962). All were made from slabs
of petrified wood and are rectangular in outline, with both faces flat.
Percussion chipping at one end and occasionally on the lateral edges
produced a steep unifacial bevel, which is concave on 4 specimens,
straight or slightly convex on 3, forming a "gouge" bit. Lengths range
from 3.3 to 4.3 cm., widths from 2.7 to 3.3 cm., thicknesses from 7 to
13 ram.
(b) OTHER UNIFACES (Fig. 17 d, e): 17 specimens. These are
crude tools of small to medium size and rather uniform in details of
manufacture. Superficially they resemble pointed pebble tools in
having a thick basal end which is unmodified pebble cortex on the
dorsal or convex face, with percussion chipped lower ends which narrow to a pointed or rounded bit. The tool outline is therefore roughly
ovate. The difference lies in the flat planar surface, which is either
the unmodified break of the original spall or has been flattened by
transverse large shallow flakes. The cross section of the object is
thick and semicircular. The longitudinal section is a modified triangle
with the plane face forming the hypotenuse, the thick unmodified
base and the slant down to the tool edge at the tip forming the
shorter sides. The ventral face is occasionally concave, making the
junction at the sinuous tool margins even more angulated. Usually
g to ~ of the dorsal or convex face is percussion chipped down to the
margins; the functional edge usually involves about half of the circumference. Materials are: tan or red chert, 13 objects; gray quartzite
2; red granuJar quartzite 2. Lengths range from 3.7 to 4.6 era., widths
from 2.1 to 3.1 cm., and thicknesses from 1.2 to 3.3 cm.
(C) POSSIBLE GOUGES: 4 rough objects are cortex-base tools with
one planar face and irregular percussion-chipped beveling on the
opposite face to produce a possible blade. One is triangular in outline
and piano-convex, the convex face being pebble cortex. The plane face
is the result of its break from the larger cobble, with one modifying
flake scar. At the larger but thinner end of the convex face, percussion flaking has produced an obtuse bevel to the bit edge, which is

sinuous. Two other objects are portions of small pebbles, irregularly
ovate in outline with cortex at the base and similar obtuse unifaeial
beveling to produce mildly convex bits which are sinuous on end
view. In each instance the cortex has been removed from the plane
face by very thin flakes, so that in none of the three objects does the
original cortex form part of the working bit of the tool. The fourth tool
has a natural taper on the dorsum, worked off only at the blade margins. Two of the objects are made of tan chert, a third of hard sandstone, the fourth of petrified wood. Lengths are 3.5 to 4.5 era., maximum widths 3.3 to 4 cm., thicknesses 1.8 to 2.5 era.
4. S5,IALL FLAKE TOOLS: In contrast to the 38,000 chips and flakes
found in the excavated squares, the 115 flakes showing retouch or
use retouch is quite modest. Most of the latter are of small to medium
size and show use scars rather than a modification of outline. Some of
them show generally better workmanship than the large flaked tools
and most reflect the same dependence on local raw materials.
(a)

FLAKE

SCI:{APERS,

MEDIUM

SIZE

(Fig. 17 h). Twenty-eight

flakes of medium size (arbitrarily chosen as between 3.5 to 4.6 era.
in greatest diameter) show evidence of having been used on one or
more edges. Flake shapes are unchanged from the original forms
which were variously oval, elongate, triangular, leaf-shaped and irregular. Five oval or ovate flakes are nicely shaped and have use scars
around the entire periphery. These use scars appear on the convex
face, indicating that the margin of the opposite concave face formed
the scraping or cutting edge. Materials include: petrified wood (8),
tan local chert (10), brown granular quartzite (7), hematite (1), and
quartz crystal (1).
(b) FLAKE SCI:~APEI:IS, SMALL SIZE
(Fig. 17 g). The 35 smaller
flakes in this category are much like those described above in shape
and evidence of use. A size range of 9, to 3.4 era. in greatest diameter
defines the group. Materials include petrified wood (5), red or brown

local chert (9.9,), granular quartzite (1), gray waxy chert (1), other
gray cherts thought to be of Central Texas origin (5), and novaculite (1). Most are within the range of 9, to 3 cm. in greatest diameter.
(C)

SMALL END-SCRAPEI:tS ON COI:~TEX FLAKES

(Fig. 17 i, j). Thirty-

one specimens are made on spalls flaked from pebbles or cobbles and
bear the original cortex on their convex face. Most are oval in outline and slightly thicker at the proximal end. One is of petrified wood,
9,4 of tan or red chert, 1 of hematite and 5 of quartzite. The range
of greatest diameter is 1.8 to 3.4 cm.; thickness of most is 3 to 6 ram.,
with a few at I0 to 19, nun.
(d) SMALL END-SCI~APEI~S WITX~ STEMS (Fig. 17 m, n). Four speci-

66

TEXAS AIICHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

mens are chipped over most of their surfaces. They are ovate-acuminate or fan-shaped in outline with a small stem, which is broken off
one of the specimens. They were shaped by small, carefully placed
pressure flaking running from the margins on the convex face to a centra! ridge. The opposite or flatter face is flaked, but it is flattened at the
bit end by use of the original spall sear or by careful shallow flaking,
to produce a concavo-convex bit with minute serrations. One tool has
these worn to a smooth arc, either in preparation or from use. The
others retain a sharper cutting edge. All of these are of tan or brown
local chert. Lengths range from 2.8 to 3 em., widths from 1.7 to 2.4
em. and thicknesses from 6.5 to 8 ram.
(e) SMALL END-SCI~APERS WITH STEEP BITS (Fig. 17 c, f). To some
people, these two specimens would be known as "thumbnail" scrapers. One is an oval, small, flat pebble of tan chert (Fig. 17 f) with
one face flattened by small percussion flakes. The opposite or dorsal
face is convex from the natural curve of the pebble and is covered by
the smooth cortex except for about 75% of the periphery, which has
multiple steep flake scars to produce an obtuse angle with the edge
of the plane face. The length is 3.2 era., the width 2.2 cm., and the
thickness is 11.5 ram. The second object (Fig. 17 c) is made from a
thinner flake of tan chert, irregularly fan-shaped in outline. The scraping bit is opposite the percussion scar. The obverse face is steeply
beveled at the bit end by tiny flaking. The converse face is sharply
concave at the bit end, accentuating the cutting edge. The scraper is
2.2 cm. long, 9..3 cm. wide and 6 mm. in greatest thickness.
(f) SMALL BIFACIAL TOOLS:
TWO small tools are well finished
bifacially. One (Fig. 16 m) is of petrified wood, wedge-shaped, with
cortex base and with some shaping of the straight faces and edges. The
terminal bit is arc-shaped and blunted bifacially as though used extensively. The dimensions are: length 3.4 era., width 2.2 era., greatest
thickness 11.4 ram. The second tool (Fig. 17 o) of tan chert, is fanshaped, thin, bifacially flaked with minute scars which produced a
thin edge around the complete circumference. One face is convex,
the other ahnost flat but shows mild rounding. The edges are minutely
serrated but show little use polish or scarring. The length is 2.9 era.,
the width 2.4 era., the thickness 5 ram.

GRAVERS

(Fig.

17p-r). Seven specimens of triangular to

pentagonal outline have a small graver tip which is placed at the
terminal projection of the flake in 6 instances, on the side in one. Four
are flaked over all of the surface area bUacia!ly. The others are partially flaked, unifacially in two instances, bifacially on the other. In two
instances, the sharp graving projection seems to have been fortuitous,

but it is accentuated by fine pressure flaking on its lateral shoulders.
The others show fine flaking to form the spur. Four of these objects
may also have been used as side scrapers. One is made of petrified
wood, 4 of tan and 2 of brown chert. Lengths range from 2.5 to 4.2
era., widths 2.2 to 2.8 era., thicknesses from 6 to 13 ram. The spurs
project 2 to 3 mm. in all but one, which is 5 mm.
(h) DRILLS (Fig. 17k, 1). There are three specimens, two of
which are broken across the middle of the bit. One of tan chert (Fig.
171) is slender, with a slight bulge near the center. It is quadrilateral
in cross section, 4.4 cm. long, 1.1 era. in greatest diameter and 8 ram.
in thickness. The other two are of gray and waxy brown cherts of
exotic origin, have expanded bases and broken drill stems (Fig. 17 k).
Basal measurements are 1.5 and 2.1 era. in width and 7 to 8 mm. in
thickness. Present lengths are 2.8 and 2.9 cm.
(i) NOTCHES (Fig. 17 s, t). Three notched flakes may have been
used as spokeshaves. Two of these are made of petrified wood and
one is of waxy gray chert. They have crescentic ares cut in one edge.
The other edges are thinned like side scrapers. The objects of petrified wood are rectangular in outline, while the chert object is ovate.
Sizes are 2.9 to 5.5 cm. in greatest diameter, 2.5 to 5 era. in lesser
diameter and 5 to 8 mm. in thickness. The crescentic bits are 11, 13
and 18 mm. in diameters.
F.

GROUND AND UsE-SR,IOOTHED STONES

There are 135 large stones from the Resch Site which show evidence
of having been shaped for or by use. These were found at all levels,
except the first 6 inches (Table 6). They consist of mortars, pitted
stones, mullers, mauls or hammerstones, anvils and flat slabs. It is of
probable significance that nearly half of these are pitted stones.
(a) ~ORTARS (Fig. 18J-k): 3 specimens are of rough ~erruginous
sandstone, irregularly oval or rectanguloid in outline. One is 20 by 13
era., 9 cm. thick, with a shallow depression on one face (Fig. 18 k).
The bowl is oval in shape, 13 by 10.5 cm. and 1.5 cm. in depth. The
second (Fig. 18 j) is a combination mortar and pitted stone, 21.5 by
19 cm. and 10.3 era. thick. One face has an oval trough 16 by 11.5 cm.,
1.3 cm. deep, with two pits in the bottom, 2.3 to 2.5 cm. in diameter.
The opposite face has a trough, 17 by 14.5 cm., in which there are
13 circular pits, each 9, by 2.7 cm. in diameter. The third mortar (Fig.
18 i) is open to some question. It is 14.5 by 14 cm. and 7 cm. thick.
One face is flat, and when seated on this face, the opposite is slanted,
with a long trough which is open at the lower end. The trough (19, by
8 cm.) is distinctly ground, but may have served some other function
than a true mortar.

fled wood and one of tan chert. They vary in size from 16 by 19. by
6.5 cm. to 6.5 by 3.2 em., but most are comfortably hand-size,
5.5 to 10 era. in diameter. Shapes are generally those of the natural
cobbles, with some alteration by peeking. In outline they are ovoid,
rectangular, triangular, trapezoidal and pentagonal. Thirty-eight of
the stones have a single pit on one face; 22 have a single pit on each
face; one has 9, pits on one face; one has 1 pit on one face and two on
the opposite, and the final stone has a single pit on one face and three
on the opposite face. The final stone listed had broken through opposed pits and 9. new pits had been placed on the break surface. The
pits are hemispherical craters, ranging from 2 to 6 era. in diameter and
4 to 16 ram. in depth; most pits are rather uniformly 2.5 to 3.5 era. in
diameter and 10 to 15 ram. in depth. The majority of pits are smooth
on the sandstone cobbles and highly polished on the hematite, but in
6 instances the pits are peeked out but not ground. Two of the sandstone and 8 of the hematite objects have one or both faces ground
smooth and mildly convex, suggesting a combined pitted stone and
muller. About a third of the objects show alteration of the edges by
peeking or grinding; the latter could have resulted from intentional
alteration or by use polish. Only two of the objects exhibit the trait,
frequent on Archaic sites in northern Louisiana, of having depressed or
ground-out areas on the lateral edges, as though to make the stones
more comfortable to the fingers. Hard usage is indicated by the fact
that 13 of the 63 stones are broken.
(e) MULLERS (Fig. 18a, e, f): 29 stones were found which are
thought to be mullers or combination mullers and hammerstones.
Eight of these are hematite, 17 ferruginous sandstone, one petrified
wood and 3 hard quartzite. In outline they are oval, ovate or rectangular with rounded corners. Diameters range from 4.5 to 11 cm.,
but most objects are 6 to 9 cm. long and 4.5 to 7.5 era. wide, with a
rather uniform thickness of 3.5 to 5.2 era. One or both faces are
ground flat or mildly convex, and half of the stones have one or both
ends battered. A sandstone object, 8.4 by 5.9 by 3.7 cm. in measurements, and a slightly smaller hematite object are oval in outline with
pointed ends which suggest a wide boatstone shape. Each has a :Sat
face with a slight oval-shaped central concavity and a strongly convex
opposite face (Fig. 19 d, e).
( d ) 1VIAULS, ANVILS AND HA~I~’IEI=~STONES ( Fig. 18 g, h) : There are
31 stones of various sizes which show some evidence of battering,
usually at the ends. Most are thought to have been heavy mauls or
hammerstones, but many have flat faces which could have served as
anvils. Eight of these are hematite, 0.5 to 2 kg. (1 to 4 pounds) in

70

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

weight. Two are spherical, and 6 are irregularly cuboidal or elongate.
Ten of similar size are cherts, granite or hard sandstones. One of these
is spherical, another is discoid, and a third is loaf-shaped. Eight are
blocks of petrified wood (Fig. 18 g), with rounded corners and flat
ends and measure 7 to 13.8 cm. in length, 4.8 to 7.8 cm. in transverse
diameters. Three blocks of hematite, one of petrified wood, and one
of sandstone are smaller, show battered ends and possibly were peeking stones or small hammerstones.
(e)
FLAT SLABS: 9 specimens. One is a large, thick saddle-shaped
slab of hematite, 9,5 cm. long and 19.5 era. wide. It shows little indication of use, except that the concave saddle face is smooth and has
shallow pits which might result from anvil use. Five other hematite
and 3 sandstone slabs are smaller: 7.5 to 16.8 era. in length and 6.3
to 10 era. in width, 1.4 to 3.7 cm. in thickness. The largest of the hematite slabs is partially hoe-shaped, but one straight side may represent
a break. The possible blade is thin but rounded, without evidence of
sharpening. A smaller sandstone slab has a gently rounded end which
is beveled and conceivably could have been used for sawing.
C. POLISHED STONE OBJECTS

Polished ornaments and problematica! objects are notable by their
scarcity, as are ground and polished celts.
(a) GROOVED AXES (Fig. 19 a, b): Two grooved axes were found
during the excavation. One (Fig. 19 a) is a large, fully grooved axe
of reddish hematite or limonite, well made but showing numerous
breaks and scratches. In several places the thin outer layer has scaled
off, as is often seen with hematite objects of some antiquity. The length
is 13 em.; the width 8 cm. at midbody, 7 cm. at the poll and 7.5 era.
just above the blade; the maximum thickness is 5.9, cm. The blade is
rounded, blunt on profile and shows fractures. The poll is smoothly
rounded but has use scars. The polished groove is 1.5 to 1.7 era. wide
and 4 to 5 mm. deep.
The second specimen is represented by the basal half (Fig. 19 b)
which was broken into 8 pieces when found. It is of black, glossy
hematite, well ground and nicely finished. The original shape was
rectangular. The width is 7 cm. at midbody, 6 em. at the base; the
thickness is 2.5 era. The existing fragment is 6.5 em. long, projecting
an original length of 12 to 13 era.
(b) CELT ( Fig. 19 c) : One celt of brown hematite is chipped and
partially ground, mostly near the blade. It is smalh 8.1 cm. long,
6 em. wide and 2 cm. in maximmn thickness. The basal end is rough,
as are the faces. The edges and bit are shaped by rough chipping and
partial grinding; the blade edge has use blunting.

(c) COUCE (Fig. 19 i): A beautifully shaped object of black
hematite is outlined by chipping and is partially ground. It is modified triangular or ovoid in shape, with thin, ground edges and base;
the faces are partly ground to a lenticular cross section. At the larger
end there is a unifaeial steeply beveled bit, which is cut straight
across, producing a curved bit edge along the reverse face. Fine secondary flaking sharpens the bit; moderate use polish occurs on the
obverse part of the bit and the reverse face is highly polished at the
blade end. Length is 5.7 era., width at bit is 3.4 cm., and maximum
thickness is 1.5 cm.
(d) HE~X~ATITE DISC (Fig. 19 h): A small circular disc of hematite is highly polished, with 5 flat facets on the obverse face. The converse face is shaped to a mild convexity by percussion chipping, then
partially ground; the peripheral margin is also ground. The object is
3.8 to 3.9 cm. in diameter, 8.5 ram. in thickness. Presumably it was an
ornament.
(0) STONE CUP FRAGMENTS (Fig. 19k, 1, m): There are 4 fragments of shaped and polished stone, two of which are from the same

object and fit together. The shapes and smooth rims suggest small
cups or stone pipe bowl fragments (no fragment shows a stem opening). The two fitted fragments (Fig. 19 m) are of a hard tan stone,
probably derived from a geode, and form the base and about ~i the
circumference of a small cup, approximately 4 era. in diameter and 2.4
cm. high. The rim is incurvate and the lip almost flat. Wall thickness
is 4 nam. just below the lip and 7 ram. at the base. It is smooth and
undecorated. The break edges are worn and smoothed.
The second object (Fig. 19 1) is a fragment of banded limonite,
with a smooth thin lip and polished surfaces and the breaks are
sharp. The projected diameter is 3 to 3.2 enI.
The third of these objects is of red jasper (Fig. 19 k) and is similarly made but slightly smaller than the object of tan stone. Nearly
half of the object is present, if it was symmetrical. It appears to be
another small cup with squared sides which are partially rounded. One
edge of the break is very thin, and the break may have occurred as
a result of miscalculation during the drilling of the concavity. Exterior
and interior surfaces are highly polished. The height is 2.6 cm. and
the diameter is 3.2 cm. The thickness is 8.5 mm. at the base, 4 mm. at
the lip and 2 ram. at the side walls.
EXOTIC MATERIALS

A small quartz crystal (Fig. 19 f) has been rounded and partieally
grooved by fine flaking at one end, presumably for suspension as a

pendant. The opposite end is natural. The length is 2.7 cm., the diameter 8 mm. A leaf-shaped fragment of quartz (Fig. 19 g) is 3 cm. long,
1.5 cm. wide and 8 mm. thick. It appears to have been roughly shaped
to form a smal! scraper. Another flake scraper of quartz crystal has
been mentioned. There is one unshaped nugget of galena (Fig. 19j),
1.8 to 2.1 era. in diameter.
FOOD

SOURCES

Direct information about food sources of the inhabitants is meager.
About 500 fragments of charred hickory, walnut and pignut hulls were
found in 382 levels of 200 5 foot squares (Fig. 20 A). By vertical provenience the occurrence of these charred hulls was as follows: Level 3:
in 46 squares; Level 4: 87; Level 5: 105; Level 6: 85; Level 7: 51;
Level 8: 7, and Level 9:1 square. Bone was minimal and fragmentary.
Most of it showed as traces in the soil, but 45 fragments were sufficiently intact to save. Six of these could be identified as deer, one as
bird. Additionally there were 9 deer teeth identified. Only two animal bones, both deer, were larger than 6 cm. in length.
PROVENIENCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ARTIFACTS

Impressions during excavation and the recording of artifact provenience indicated that artifacts were scattered throughout the midden
in all excavated areas, with minor concentrations (Fig. 3) in the
central block. It also seemed that concentrations of artifacts were
heavier over the lower end of the terrace than on the slopes or at the
upper end. Good evidences of vertical distribution, using relative nmnbers of objects in the various levels, were also established. We have
attempted to clarify these impressions and by various studies of horizonta! and vertical provenience, to establish as clear a picture of
aboriginal occupation as we can justify with the numbers of objects
involved.
It is hoped by such studies to indicate patterns of aboriginal occupation during the various culture periods represented at the site, to
note changes in time, and to note variations in activities-male or
female-in various parts of the site. Our failure to reach these objectives to our satisfaction or to fully document our tentative conclusions can presumably be attributed to the nature of the occupation
and of the soil, to the many factors which influence deposition and
alter the original placement of objects, and possibly to some deficiencies in our study niechanism.
Theoretically, a site which was occupied intermittently or continuously for more than a thousand years should show a layering of

occupational refuse, distributed to some extent in accordance with
the living patterns or activities. Structures were built and destroyed,
fires were made and covered, pots were broken and discarded, stone
objects were fashioned or resharpened or lost, with the residues presumably available for study. If women cooked in certain areas, firebeds or firestones, ashes and charcoal should so indicate and sherds of
broken pots or the stones for grinding seeds or the cracking of nuts
should be nearby, especially if broken and discarded. If men sat in
certain places to fashion or resharpen projectile points or stone tools,
or to work bone, wood or leather objects, then a concentration of
flakes and discarded or lost objects might so indicate. All of these indicators were present but seldom in such concentrations as to give a
clear picture. We are forced to accept minimal conclusions.
The factors at this site which mitigate against this theoretical layering, structuring and clustering of residue are numerous. There are
no evidences of large permanent structures or of heavy occupation;
no burials were found. The soil is porous sand, easily washed by rain
or overflow, and easily disturbed by human or animal activities. Vertical as welt as horizontal displacement of objects is readily accomplished, and we found evidence of much tunneling by gophers and
other animals. Human occupation and land clearing during the past
century has certainly had some effect, and the light soil could as easily
have been churned by aboriginal activities as by recent cultivation. At
any stage of aboriginal occupation, objects left by previous inhabitants
could have been found by adults or children and reused or at least
dislocated.

A.

HORIZONTAL DISTRIBUTION

The provenience of major artifact classes by excavated 5 foot
squares in the central block is shown in Fig. 3, in relation to features
like rock clusters, ash and charcoal concentrations and possible post
molds. Disturbances due to previous excavations are indicated, chiefly
in the southwestern sector of the block. The numbers of each of the
three artifact classes-pottery sherds, projectile points and stone toolsare indicated in the square of origin. There is remarkable uniformity
in the relatively thin artifactual residue. The 245 squares contained
2390 of these objects, averaging slightly less than 10 per square and
slightly more than 1 per 6 inch level. Of these, 1387 were sherds,
averaging 5.66 per square; 456 were projectile points, averaging 1.86
per square; and 547 were stone tools, averaging 2.23 per square. Only
20 of the 245 squares contained more than 10 sherds each; 9 of these
squares were in the NE sector, 7 in the SE sector, 1 in the NW and 3

76

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

in the SW sectors. Only 2 squares, both in the NE sector, contained
more than 5 projectiles each. Twelve squares yielded more than 5
stone tools each; 7 were in the NE sector, 4 in the NW, and 1 in the
SW. Of the 31 squares in which these unusual numbers of objects were
found, 21 are included in the 100 squares which surround the center
stake, between the N25, E25, $9_5 and W25 lines. A further cheek of the
total objects found in the i00 central squares shows that the major
concentration of objects is in sherds. There were 633 sherds in these
squares, an average of 6.33 per square in comparison with an average
of 5.2 sherds per square in the remaining 145 squares of the central
block. In the 100 squares around the center stake there were 191 projectiles, averaging slightly above the average of 1.83 for the remaining
145 squares. There were 256 stone tools, or 2.56 per square, which is
somewhat above the average of 2.0 for the remaining 145 squares. It is
revealing of the thin occupation that the sherds of Vessels 1 to 4, most
of which were found within the 100 squares around the center stake,
total 90 or one-seventh of the 633 sherds found in these squares. All of
the sherds in these 100 squares would, therefore, be the equivalent of
only 30 pottery vessels.
Another area of concentration appears in the northern tier of
squares in the NE sector of the central block. Thirty squares lying
between the N25 and N45 lines and between the 0 and E40 lines
yielded 335 artifacts (11 per square), of which sherds average 5.7,
projectiles 2.5 and stone tools 3.0 per square, indicating a concentration of lithics rather than sherds.
Plotting of the horizontal distribution of charred nut hulls, pitted
stones and other ground stone tools (mullers, mortars, hammerstones,
anvils) shows two interesting configurations (Fig. 20 A). There is an
area of concentration around and east of the center stake, corresponding to the area of sherd concentration described above. There is also a
band of concentration diagonally across the northern tier of squares
in the central block, and a third minor band across the SW sector.
All three bands suggest a NW-SE trending, almost paralleling the
course of the terrace (Fig. 2).
Fig. 20 B shows the provenience by squares of the sherds from
which Vessels 1 to 4 were reconstructed, also the horizontal provenience of the sherds identified as Tehefuncte, Marksville, Coles
Creek and Caddoan. The sherds of Vessel 1 were almost undisturbed
after it was broken, suggesting that it was covered with soil shortly
thereafter (no burial or cache pit was in evidence). The sherds of Vessels 2 and 4 were moderately dispersed over areas of 100-250 square
feet, with a few widely displaced sherds. The sherds of Vessel 3 were

THE

I~ESCH

SITE

77

scattered over half of the excavated block, as far as 60 feet apart. The
preponderance of the recognized Tchefunete sherds, also Vessel 1 and
most of Vessel 3, are in the western half of the excavated block (Fig.
20 B and Table 5), near the stream. Marksville sherds are scattered
but most are in the northern sectors. Coles Creek sherds, differing
from Tehefunete, are proponderantly in the eastern sectors of the
block, further from the stream, while Caddoan sherds are more
widely dispersed than are those of any other period. These proveniences suggest limited occupation, in time and extent, during the Tehefuncte and Coles Creek periods.
In order to divide the central block of excavations more evenly, the
occurrence of objects in 4 quadrants (to distinguish from the sectors
defined by the survey axes) was calculated after quadrating the block
by using the El0 line as a N-S divider and the 0-0 line as E-W divider.
Table 5 shows the relative occurrence of various groups of objects in
the resulting quadrants, which contain 65, 70, 54 and 56 squares. It
also compares the relative occurrence of the various objects or groupings in the 8 squares north of the" N120 line (North area), the 19
squares east of the access road (East area) and the 13 squares encircling the excavation block (other areas). In the central block, it
appears that the average of sherds, projectiles, chipped and ground
tools, and flakes are fairly uniform in the 4 quadrants. The average
number of sherds is slightly higher in the NE and SE quadrants. Dart
projectiles and stone tools average slightly higher in the NE (heavier
archaic oecupationP), and flakes slightly higher in the NW. Arrow
projectiles are more numerous in the SE and SW quadrants than in the
northern tier, corresponding with the slightly higher yield of Caddoan
and Coles Creek sherds in the southern quadrants. The larger numbers of Tehefunete sherds in the western quadrants and of Marksville
in the northern is again in evidence.
None of these variations, however, is as marked as the differences
noted in the areas away from the major excavated block. The North
area, most of which is 100 feet from the block, maintains a good
sherd yield, but bone-tempered sherds are diminished and claytempered increased in relative proportions. No Tehefuncte sherds
and only one each of Marksville and Coles Creek were found, but 10
Caddoan sherds were recognized. Dart projectiles hold up well, but
chipped and ground stone tools are in small numbers and flakes are
distinctly less numerous. The indications are of lighter occupation in
the North area during earlier periods but of increased usage during
Caddoan times.
The East area, across the access road, shows a general drop of about

50 percent in sherds, dart propectiles, chipped and ground stone tools
and flakes, in comparison with the cenh’al excavated block. The absence of Caddoan sherds and the low yield of only one Coles Creek
sherd and one arrow propeetile, in comparison with 4 Marksville and
one Tchefunete sherds, indicates that the lighter occupation occurred
during the earlier ceramic periods. This indication is enhanced by the
preponderance of sand-tempered sherds over clay-tempered.
The 13 other squares surrounding the central block show nothing
distinctive in a differential fashion, but a diminished yield of all artifacts and flakes again suggests the preference of the peoples at a!!
times for the higher terrace rather than the slopes.
B.

COMBINED HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION.

A further study of pottery sherd concentration in the central excavated block, combining horizontal and vertical distribution, was made
by constituting two artificial zones: an upper zone for which all sherds
in Levels 1 through 5 were plotted in the squares from which they
derived, and a lower zone comprising sherds from Levels 6 through
9, similarly plotted. This was checked by plotting sherds by square of
provenience for each of the five major levels, 3-7. The purpose was to
determine whether the several concentrations of sherds, previously
noted, might be related to earlier or later occupations. Although the
sherd counts by individual squares and levels were generally too
sparse to be defnitive, when combined with the zone groupings
there were some clarifications of the clustering. The concentration of
sherds immediately south of the center stake (Fig. 3) in the squares
between 0-S15 and W10-E10 lines involved all major levels. By contrast, the concentration immediately north of the center stake (0-N15
and W10-E5) related largely to sherds from the upper zone, especially Level 4. Sherds of Vesse! 4 were involved in this deposit.
Another concentration east of the center stake, between lines 0-S10
and E15-E25, derived from the upper zone and especially level 3, and
included sherds of Vessel 2. Two concentrations in the NE sector
(N20-35, 0-El5 and N10-30, E25-40) had scattered sherds from the
upper zone and major derivation from Levels 6 and 7.
All of these "concentrations" are relative and seem to result from
the breakage of only a few vessels in each instance. With one exception, these sherd concentrations coincide with the areas in which
charred nut hulls and ground stone tools (Fig. 20 A) are concentrated,
but no close association is in evidence. The exception is the northcentral concentration of sherds (N20-35, E-15) which derive fi’om
Levels 6 and 7 and with which a light residue of nut hulls and grind-

80

ing or pitted stones is associated. Ash and charcoal are missing.
Except for the area immediately south of the center stake where the
possible post molds suggest a structure, there is no good correlation
of these various evidences of culinary and other domestic activities.
The conclusion is ahnost inescapable that intermittent and sporadic
brief camping in temporary shelters is represented, with the campsites
at various locations on the preferred lower end of the terrace.
C. VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION

Most of our data on vertical distribution are derived from use of
the entire collection, plotted by vertical artificial levels (Table 6, Fig.
21, 9,2). Levels 1 and 2 are combined because of the paucity of artifacts and the disturbed nature of the soil in the plow zone. A few
flakes found in the 6 inches below Level 9 (54-60 inch depth) are
added to the totals from that level in the three involved squares; no
other artifacts were found below 54-inch depth. The table and graphs
therefore show Levels 1-2 and 3 through 9.
In view of the variations in horizontal distribution of certain objects
in these squares outside of the central block (Table 5), the artifacts
from these extraneous areas were plotted separately by excavation
levels. Those from the North and East areas will be discussed later.
The variations are minor and the numbers probably are not statistically significant, hence we include all areas in the single major study
of vertical provenience.
Before examining the results of these studies, evidence should be
recorded that pottel7 sherds were subjected to considerable vertical as
well as horizontal displacement. Many of the sherds showed teeth
marks of rodents, especially among the sherds tempered with bone or
clay; sherds of Vessel 2 had been gnawed to an extent that adjacent
sherds no longer touched. Moreover, sherds of Vessels 2, 3 and 4 were
not only dispersed laterally (Fig. 20 B) but were found at depths
which varied from 18 to 30 inches. Vessel 2, for example, derived
largely from Level 3 (7 sherds) and Level 4 (4 sherds) but 2 sherds
of this vessel came from Level 6. Vessel 3 had 6 sherds from Level 7,
4 from Level 4, inferred as its level of origin, but other sherds came
from Levels 3, 5 and 6. Similar vertical displacement is noted of other
sherds which formed portions of vessels. The sand-tempered urn, of
which a fitted portion is shown in Fig. 6 b, had sherds from Levels 3, 4,
5 and 6; the assumed origin is Level 5. The three portions of sand
and bone-tempered vessels, of flower-pot shape (Fig. 6 a, c, d), each
had the greater number of sherds from Level 4 but others derived
from Levels 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The incised sand-tempered vessel shown

THE

IRESCH

SITE

in Fig. 6 g, h is represented by 2 sherds from Level 4 and one each
from Levels 3 and 6. Three fitted Marksville Stamped sherds (Fig.
10 v) were found in Squares E1 N3 and W1 N30, 135 feet apart, but
this is not serious because all were from Level 6. Sherds of a Coles
Creek Incised vessel (Fig. 11 a, f) came from Levels 2, 3 and 6. Seven
sherds of a single Caddoan bottle spout (Fig. ilk) were found in
Levels 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (2 each from Levels 4 and 6). Two sherds of
the same Pineland Punctated vessel (Fig. 11 y, z) were from Levels
3 and 5.
These distressing vagaries in vertical provenience of sherds, with
evidences of upward and downward displacement, inhibit the drawing of conclusions from any small number of sherds; they force reliance on large numbers and general trends rather than finer delineations. One can only hope that provenience of stone objects is more
reliable, although there is no direct evidence for or against vertical displacement of non-ceramic items.
The provenience of all objects found at the site is shown in Table 6,
by individual types, by classes of artifact types, and by excavation
levels. The total number of artifacts, excluding flakes and unworked
stones, is 2696, of which potsherds constitute 57~g. From this Table we
have drawn graphs of a number of types and classes in attempts to
find signifiicant trends.
Fig. 21 A shows the changes in relative numbers of major artifact
classes by excavation levels. Each horizontal bar shows the percentages of the total artifacts found at that level represented by sherds,
dart points, arrow points, chipped stone tools and ground stone tools;
the total number of artifacts from a given level is shown to the right
of each bar. Objects of uncertain provenience and "polished and exotic
objects" are not included. Notable trends are: (1) pottery sherds
increase in relative proportions from the lower to the upper levels, at
a fairly regular rate and largely at the expense of dart points and
chipped stone tools. (2) Dart points and chipped stone tools are parallel in numbers at the various levels in their progressive decrease
from bottom to top. (3) Ground stone tools show a similar relative
decrease with time, interrupted in Levels 3 and 4. (4) Arrow points
are missing from the lower levels and progressively increase in the
upper levels, but only exceed dart points in Levels 1 and 2. Except for
this progressive but incomplete replacement of dart points by arrow
points, there are therefore no striking and sudden changes in the relative numbers of these artifact classes, but rather slow and progressive
alterations. We shall look later at changes of types within these
classes.

In Fig. 9,1 B the pottery sherds are examined for changes in tempering characteristics from bottom to top, presumably reflecting changes
in time during the occupation of the site. Sherds of uncertain provenience and with tempering characteristics other than the three major
ones-sand, bone and day-are excluded. Again there are no sudden
changes; bone tempering remains remarkably stable at 35 to 40~ at all
levels. The only significant trend is the slow but progressive diminution in sand tempering and the converse increase in clay tempering,
especially in the three top levels. Between Levels 7 and 4, during
major occupation of the site, bone tempering slowly increases and,
overall, it is the most popular aplastic at the site.
In Fig. 9,2 the graphs show percentages by excavation levels of various artifact types within the classes of artifacts previously examined,
as well as some of these classes. The bar graph for a given level expresses the percentage of the type or class at that level of the total
number for all levels, hence shows changes in numbers from below
upward. When compared, there is some evidence of relative popularity of certain types at the various periods reflected by vertical
levels. The graphs as a whole show that the major occupation of the
site is reflected in Levels 7 (36-42 inch depth) through Level 4 (18-24
inch depth). If we may safely use total sherds and stone flakes as indicators of expected artifact density at given levels, since these are
objects which are present at all levels and in largest numbers, it
would appear that a percentage of any type or class below 13Yo or
above 25~o at any level between 4 and 7 is evidence of significant
alteration.
The rapid drop in numbers and frequencies of objects in Levels
8 and 9 suggests that these levels are largely below the occupation
zone, and that some of the artifacts may have been carried down.
However, the presence of most classes of artifacts, up to 2-3~, in Level
8 make it possible that the artificial dividing line between Levels 7 and
8, at 3J6 feet, may have been slightly above the lowest occupation zone
in some squares. Moreover, the occurrence in Levels 8 and 9 of
Archaic objects like the two grooved axes, projectile point types like
Palmillas, Kent and Ellis which elsewhere seem to be slightly earlier
than Gary, thick chipped stone tools, and the broken base of a concave-base point indicates visits to the site by Archaic peoples before
the major occupation started.
At the other end of the spectrum, there is a progressive diminution
in number of artifacts in the uDper three levels, 165 specimens in Level
3 and only 81 from Levels 1 and 2 combined, in comparison with
400-700 objects per level at Levels 4-7. The only exceptions are arrow

projectiles and, surprisingly, flakes; the latter diminish but at a slower
rate. One might think of selective collecting from the site, but there is
no history of such in recent years and amateur collectors seldom
bother with crude tools. Even the wooded parts of the site show the
same trends, with a deposit of virtually sterile soil over the top foot.
We must conclude that the site was abandoned in early Caddoan
times and covered with virtually sterile soil.
The bar graph (Fig. 22) for tota! pottery sherds follows the above
trends, with some representation in Levels 9 and 8, a marked increase
in Level 7 to peak in Level 6 and gradually fall in Levels 5 and 4,
and finally a rapid fall in Levels 3 to 1. The trends for each of the
three tempering techniques, sand, bone and clay, are remarkably
similar to the total graph and to each other; minor variations are the
slightly higher than average percentage for sand-tempered sherds in
the lower levels and drop-off in the upper levels, the increase in bonetempered sherds in Level 4, and the higher than average of claytempered sherds in Levels 3-t. These studies, however, corroborate
the findings noted in Fig. 21 B that pottery sherds were present at all
levels and that no striking change in tempering techniques occurred
during the life of the site.
The graphs of vertical provenience of Tehefuncte, Marksville, Coles
Creek and Caddoan sherds (Fig. 22) reflect the unhappy vertical
displacement of sherds noted previously. From many stratigraphie
studies elsewhere, deposition at this site would be expected in the
order listed, with Tehefuncte oldest and therefore in lowest levels,
and Caddoan most recent and therefore in the uppermost levels. The
Marksville and Coles Creek graphs are gratifying, with Marksville
percentages peaking in Level 6 along with high levels of dart points
and chipped stone tools and before the rise in arrow projectiles; and
with Coles Creek percentages peaking in Level 4, after the advent of
arrow projectiles and the fall-off in dart points and heavy stone
tools. Tchefunete sherds are respectably represented in Levels 7 and
6 but the persistence in Level 5 and increase in Level 4, after Marksville peaks, can only be explained by mistyping or upward transport
of sherds; we prefer the latter explanation. The real difficulty lies in
the Caddoan sherd graph and the nmnber of identifiable Caddoan
sherds, 81, augments the difficulty. There is a lot of difference in the
upward displacement of 6 to 12 Tchefunete sherds and the downward
displacement of 50 Caddoan sherds, well over half of the total number, from the expected Levels 3 and 4 down to Levels 6, 7 and 8. In
order to eliminate the possibility of typing errors, we regraphed the
unquestioned Caddoan sherds, choosing only bottle spouts and en-

90

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

graved sherds; with this maneuver the only significant alteration of
the graph was the elimination of the two sherds from Level 8. There
was still a peak in Level 6 and good representation in Levels 5 and 7.
These sherds were well scattered (Table 5, Fig. 20 B) and there
were no evidences of their being in cache or refuse pits. The numerous recounted evidences of vertical sherd displacement at this
site preclude any firm conclusions, but it would indeed be surprising
if rodents had the discrimination necessary to move Tchefuncte sherds
upward and Caddoan sherds downward. This finding with respect to
Caddoan ceramics at Resch Site emphasizes the significance of the
Caddoan sherds found in Marksville period mounds at the Coral
Snake (McClurkan, Field and Woodall 1966) and Jonas Short (Jelks
1965) sites. This also points to the need for further studies of Caddoan
beginnings in the Sabine and Angelina drainages.
The inverse relationship between dart and arrow projectiles shown
in Fig. 9.1 A is borne out by the percentage graphs in Fig. 29.. However, total dart points are in larger percentage in Level 7 than are
total sherds; the dart points peak at this level, in comparison with
the sherd peak in Level 6. The Gary points more closely parallel total
sherds in Levels 5 through 7 and persist in respectable numbers in
the upper levels as arrow points come in. Separate graphs were made
for the Gary typical, Gary small, Gary tiny and for the individual
varieties (Table 4). These are not shown in Fig. 29, because the only
variations from the graphs of Gary points occur in the Gary ty~)ical
and in those varieties whose numbers are too small to give reliable
results. The graphs for Gary small and Gary tim! are virtually identical at all levels, suggesting that the artificial dividing line between
these two groups, which we established at a length of 3 em., is of
no real value and that they should be considered together as Gary
small, with a range in length of 2 to 4.5 em. Gary typical may be
slightly earlier at this site, consistent with findings elsewhere that
Gary points diminish in size with passage of time. The graph of Gary
tppical showed a peak of 317o in Level 7, with 1770 in Level 6 and
27.570 in Level 5; there were no Gary typical in Levels 1 and 2. Possibly more significant is that 6570 of Gary tylgical were made of petrified wood, compared with 4070 of Gary small and 18.27o of Gary tin~!.
The small numbers of Gary typical, 29 total, interfere with complete
reliance on these differences.
Graphs of the Gary varieties similarly show that those represented
by sufficiently large numbers, like varieties emory, kemp and kaufman,
show frequency graphs which are almost identical with each other
and with the graphs for Gary points in Fig. 22; all are represented in

THE

Level 8, increase in Level 7, peak in Level 6 and progressively drop
thereafter. Varieties emory and kemp are so closely similar in range
of size (Table 4), in vertical distribution in the midden, and in the
materials from which they were made (35 and 33goo of petrified wood,
respectively) that, at this site, the distinction appears to be an artificial one. Variety colfax peaks in frequency in Level 7 and may therefore be slightly earlier; runge, panna maria and hobson peak at Levels
6, 5 and 4, respectively, but their numbers are small.
Further study of the individual dart point types shows that Ellis,
Palmillas, Yarbrough and Kent types appear early and drop off rapidly
above Level 6 (Fig. 22). These types are largely responsible for the
peak percentage of total dart points at Level 7. Ellis type has a total
percentile distribution more nearly resembling that of Gary type; the
other three are confined largely to the lower levels. If there was an
Archaic occupation before advent of pottery, these projectile point
types were represented, especially since one specimen each of Palmillas, Kent and Ellis were from Level 9, where Gary was missing.
The arrow point graphs show that Friley, the predominant type,
generally resembles the total arrow points in vertical distribution,
although Cliffton and Colbert seem to be slightly earlier. The numbers
are too few to draw firm conclusions.
The vertical distribution of chipped stone tools (Table 6, Fig. 9.2)
is almost identical with Gary type projectile points, except for the
presence of two of these tools from Level 9. Thin bifacial tools, often
but improperly termed blades or knives (Table 6), follow a similar
distribution, with a peak at Level 6; large ovate "blades" may be
slightly earlier, as they are present in Levels 8 to 6 and none thereafter, but the numbers are small. The graph of rectangular slabs
"(Fig. 22) shows a peak at Level 6 but persistence to Level 3. The
distribution of thick bifacial tools is similar to that of chipped stone
tools in general, but the peak in frequeney occurs in Level 7 rather
than Level 6. The graph of pointed pebble tools (Fig. 22) shows a
peak at Level 7 with slow declines through Level 4. Unless there was
a larger pre-pottery Archaic occupation of this site than the excavation evidences and provenience studies indicate, most or all of these
chipped stone tools, as well as dart points of late Archaic types, continued in use after the advent of pottery.
The small flake tools have a somewhat different distribution pattern
(Fig. 22, Table 6). They are confined largely to Levels 5, 6 and 7
with peak incidence in Level 6. By contrast, ground stone tools (Table
6), represented in Fig. 22 by the graph of pitted stones, are distributed at al! levels but peak at Level 4 and continue in significant hum-

bers into Level 3. The polished and exotic objects are not included
in Fig. 9.9. because of small numbers, but Table 6 shows the grooved
axes to be in Levels 8 and 9, and the remainder to occur in Levels
7 through 5. There is a significant paucity of polished, ornamenta!,
exotic or presumably eeremonial items at the site.
A study of the flake debitage by levels (Fig. 22, Table 6), with
the horizontal distribution studies (Table .5) previously reported,
shows a smooth pattern which is our best evidence of occupation
density. The surprise is the upward shift of the graph, with the peak
at Level 5 and large numbers of flakes in the upper 3 levels, findings
which are inconsistent with the distribution of projectile points and
other chipped stone artifaets. In the absence of artifact collecting from
the site, we have no explanation for the difference in density of flakes
and other objeets in the upper levels.
In counting the flakes a separate count was made of petrified wood
flakes, since many projectile points and tools at the site were made of
this material; total flakes and flakes of petrified wood were recorded
separately for each level and square. The overall percentage of petrified wood among the flakes is 21.2, but the significant finding in the
flake study is the progressive deerease, level by level and almost
mathematically exact, in the percentage of petrified wood flakes from
the bottom to the top of the midden (Table 7). From frequencies of
30g at Levels 8 and 9 and 26.8go at Level 7, this material diminishes
among the flakes to 19.8go by Level 4, and 16.2~o in Levels 1-2. The
large numbers involved and the straight line changes preclude this
being an aeeidental finding and assure the reliability of its refleeting
a ehange in preference on the part of the inhabitants, from petrified
wood to local cherts, with the passage of time. We then tabulated
the frequencies and pereentages of petrified wood among the materials
from whieh various objects were made, by levels (Table 7). Considerable variation is exhibited from level to level, especially when the
numbers of objeets is small, but the same general trend of diminishing
use of petrified wood as a material for manufaeture of projeetile
points and tools, from lower to upper levels, is shown.
Probably more significant than the level to level ehange in a given
type of object is the evidenee of variation between types of objeets
in the i~ereentage of petrified wood, shown in the column on the right
side of Table 7. The highest percentage oeeurs in dart points other
than Gary type (46.5~) and in large chipped tools (44.57oo) ; Gary
points are next with 39.1% and the lowest frequencies occur in arrow
points (30.4g) and small flake tools (16.2%). There is excellent eorrelation between these findings and the stratigraphie evidenees, pre-

viously discussed and shown in Table 6 and Fig. 22, that thick bifacial
and uniiacial tools and dart points reach peak numbers early (Level
7) and drop off in upper levels; that Gary points apparently persist
longer and peak later than Palmillas, Yarbrough, Kent and Ellis;
that arrow points are in higher levels and therefore are presumably
later than Gary dart points; and that small flake tools peak at Level 6
and therefore presumably are popular at a later time than the thicker
tools. A further individual check on materials from which the dart
points, other than Gary type, were made shows the following percentages of petrified wood; Yarbrough, 66.7Z; Kent, 61.9; Palmillas,
56.2; Elam, 50; Ellis, 28.8. Stratigraphic studies at other sites have
shown Yarbrough, Palmfllas and Kent to precede Gary type in time,
even more clearly than the stratigraphy does at Resch Site (Fig. 22).
The low percentage of petrified wood in Ellis type may result from
technological reasons-it may have been more difficult to produce the
typical corner notching with petrified wood than with cherts, and
elsewhere local cherts seem to have been the favorite material for
the manufacture of these points. A similar technological preference
may apply to other types of objects at Reseh Site, to account for the
preferential use of petrified wood almost exclusively to produce the
flat slabs, and of chert almost exclusively to make pointed pebble
tools. A similar explanation is probable for the infrequent use of petrified wood to make small flake tools. Generally, however, it seems
safe to assume that the earlier inhabitants of the site used petrified
wood nearly as often as they did cherts, flints or quartzites in the
manufacture of their tools, leaving many flakes of this material from
the manufacture or resharpening of the tools, whereas later inhabitants showed an increasing preference for other materials.
We have applied this assumption as a check on the various areas
at the site, divided as indicated in Table 5. The percentages of petrified wood among the total flakes are as follows: NE quadrant, 97.4;
East area, 23.6; "other areas," 22.2; SE quadrant, 22; SW quadrant,
19.3; NW quadrant 18.5; North area, 17.4Z. We do not have good
indicators of other kinds for all of these areas, but we have noted
that the NE quadrant has a higher yield of dart projectiles and
chipped stone tools than others; that the East area seemed to have
evidence of more occupation during earlier than later times; and that
the North area showed the reverse, with more evidence of later occupation. These are ephemeral judgments but they do correlate with
the flakes to indicate that, at this site, percentages of petrified wood
among flakes, projectile points and most chipped stone tools are
good indicators of relative age.

RADIOCARBON DETERMINATIONS
Samples of charred nut hulls and small wood charcoal were submitted to the Radiocarbon Laboratory, Balcones Research Center, University of Texas, through E. Mott Davis. The decision was made to
use the charred nuts since they presumably were deposited during the
aboriginal occupation. Each sample was made up of materials from
several squares but identical levels, in most eases adjacent squares
near the origin of grid (Fig. 20 A). Specimens from Levels 3 and 4
were combined to make an adequate sample; similarly specimens
from Levels 7 and 8 were combined for an adequate sample from the
lower levels. The specimens had been collected with a minimum of
handling, labelled by square and depth, and carefully wrapped in foil
until submission. Results were reported as follows (Radiocarbon
1968: 393-4)
Tx-482 Resch Site, Levels 3 and 4 2250±140, or 300 B.C.
Comment: date earlier than expected.
Tx-484 Reseh Site, Level 5 2360±130, or 410 B.C.
Comment: earlier than anticipated from this level, which should
not date before Marksville times.
Tx-481 Resch Site, Level 6 2150±100, or 200 B.C.
Comment: date consistent with occurrence of Tchefuncte sher~s
on this level, but by stratigraphy should be earlier than Tx-482
and Tx-484.
Tx-483 Resch Site, Level 7 and 8 1850-+-90, or 100 A.D.
Comment: too recent in view of dates from higher levels and
indications of pre-Tchefuncte or Tchefuncte time range.
General Comment: dates are generally satisfactory in that the
major occupation is on Tchefuncte and Marksville time levels, judging from trade sherds. Vagaries in distribution of sherds and of
charred nut hulls from which dates were obtained are explainable
by aboriginal churning of light sand midden and subsequent heavy
gopher disturbance.
Other comparatively recent radiocarbon dates are pertinent to the
Resch Site. Listed by periods, they are as follows:
Sand-tempered and Tchefuncte period: (1) Ambler (1967) states
that a series of 27 radiocarbon dates, not published, was established

included two dates from Zone II which contained abundant artifacts
including plain sand-tempered pottery and Gary points, Tx-336

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The Resch site is a small occupation area of only a few acres on a
minor stream in East Texas. Yet the residual artifacts show occupation
during every known major culture period from Archaic to Caddoan.
By direct evidence of radiocarbon dating from the site the occupation
extended from 400 B.C. to 1O0 A.D., which spans the Tehefuncte and
part of the Marksvflle periods of the lower Mississippi Valley, according to present concepts. The latter part of the site occupation has

materials from Troyville, Coles Creek and early Caddoan; numerous
radiocarbon datings have established the latter at approximately
1000-1200 A.D. Moreover, if the 1Resch Site had pre-ceramie occupation in late or middle Archaic times, as seems likely from stratigraphie
and technological evidences, the span of occupation at the site is
somewhere between two and four thousand years.
The second point of concern is with density of occupation. All
evidences, direct and inferential, are of light occupation at all times.
There were no dense concentrations of ceramic or lithie objects;
there is an average of only one artifact from each 9 to 10 cubic feet of
midden; the yield of artifacts was no more than 1 to 2 per year of total
occupation, if this had been continuous, from an excavated area of
7200 square feet or 1/6 acre. Even if there were 5 acres of equally
occupied area, which is not the ease, this would amount to only 30 to
60 sherds or stone objects left on the entire site per year of occupation, much less than one family would be expected to lose. There
were no evidences of well-eonstrueted houses or prepared firebeds,
only 5 small pieces of daub and a like number of mud-dauber nest
fragments, suggesting an absence of permanent habitations. No burials
were found and there is a paucity of ornaments and ceremonial
objects. The forced inference is of brief occupations by small groups,
probably no more than family or extended family size, but returning
time after time. The further inference is of seasonal visits to the site,
never a permanent habitation, for a special purpose and by succeeding
generations over centuries of time. Certain permanent natural attractions, seasonal in nature, are inferred.
This major attraction must have been a reliable food source. During
most of the site occupation, these were foraging peoples, away from
the seacoast or large lakes and therefore exploiters of forest economy.
Even after pottely came in, horticulture or incipient agriculture was
probably less important than natural food sources and evidences elsewhere indicate that only during Coles Creek-Mississippian-Caddoan
times, which would be the last few hundred years of the site’s occupation, did corn-bean-squash agriculture become the paramount way of
life. For a foraging people, major food-gatherin~ activities are hunting, trapping and netting of animals or birds, fishing, shellfish gathering, the digging of roots and tubers, and the collecting of seeds, fruits
and nuts. Fish and shellfish could not have been the attraction at
this site. Roots and tubers were never known to be a major food source
in the Southeast, and opportunities for hunting or fowling were probably about the same elsewhere in the region as at this site-probably
better for migratory waterfowl on the Sabine than here. But we do

98

SOCIETY

have evidences that nut-gathering may have been the attraction at this
site: (1) there is a variety of edible native nuts in the valley at
present, including acorns, hickory nuts, walnuts, pignuts, native pecans
and chinquapins (dwarf chestnuts). This variety must have been
available during aboriginal times, as oak and hickory are the climax
forest throughout the Southeastern uplands, replacing pines whenever
conditions are favorable, and the number and variety now present
suggest that this replacement along the small streams and dissected
hills of this valley occurred many centuries ago. (2) The chief food
residue in the midden is charred nut hulls, of hickory, walnut and pignut. (3) Pitted stones which we believe to relate to nutting (theories
that they were capstones for fire drills or stone drills have no special
application at this site; no drilled objects were found), are the most
numerous ground stone objects at the site, distributed throughout the
midden and equal in numbers to the combined total of mortars, mullers and hammerstones. Their number almost equals that of the thin
blades, presumed cutting tools (63 versus 86).
The projectiles, cutting, chopping and scraping tools at tleseh Site
indicate that the peoples carried on their usual huntin~ activities during their residence at the site, as might be expected. Conditions were
probably favorable for a variety of activities, as suggested in the
discussion of flora and fauna of the area. But we suggest that autumnal
nut-gathering, in an environment which was favorable for collateral
hunting and gathering of other kinds, was the attraction which
brought peoples to the same site for so long a time. The site is on one
of the larger tributaries of the Sabine leading up into the rolling hills,
on a favorably located high terrace immediately by the stream and at
the level where the valley suddenly widens out and several smaller
streams enter. If an occasional family lingered at the site, after horticulture was established, the sand soil was suitable for garden crops; it
is possible that this happened in Caddoan times, as we have seen that
evidences of Caddoan occupation were more widespread over the
site than those of some other periods.
Who were the peoples who visited the site? Initially they were
probably Archaic people, despite the finding of pottery sherds in the
lowest midden levels. This is inferred because of the stratigraphie
frequencies (Fig. 9,2) and identity of artifacts with those found in
pre-pottery levels of sites like Yarbrough (Johnson 1962). Grooved
axes, projectile point types Yarbrough, Yantis, Pahnillas and Kent,
and thick chipped stone bifacial and unifaeial tools, all of which were
established types by middle Archaic times, were found in the lowest
midden levels or the subiaeent sand. All of these peak in frequency

(Fig. 22) before Gary points and pottery sherds. Occasional visits to
the site by mid-Archaic peoples, presumably as early as 2000 B.C., are
suggested. The high frequency of other Archaic projectile types and
tools in Level 7 indicates increased usage during late Archaic times
(Table 8). The inventory of this late Archaic occupation (Table 6)
corresponds to that of La Itarpe Aspect.
When pottery-making peoples began to frequent the site, they were
still using Archaic tool and projectile point types; they were making
simple jars and bowls, usually undecorated except for occasional lip
notching or infrequent incised and punctated decoration. These were
flat or round bottomed, never conoidal-base vessels, and were tempered with sand, bone or clay, individually or in mixtures. As trine
passed, sand tempering became less frequent but these tempering
traditions persisted in this valley down to the time of European contact. Deeper jars, tecomate-like constricted orifice vessels and "flowerpot"-shaped vessels were made later. These simple wares, which persisted for centuries as the basic culinary vessels, were similar to types
called Bear Creek Plain of the lower Sabine and Angelina areas, if
sand-tempered, and to the ware called Williams Plain, found through
much of East Texas, eastern Oklahoma and into Arkansas and Louisiana, in clay and bone-tempered ceramics. The early pottery-making
people of Resch site were still basically in a forest-exploiting economy
of hunting and gathering, used the atlatl and dart, tipped the darts
with stone points which had contracting stems and were made of local
materials, cherts and petrified wood; rarely they had flints from central
Texas or quartzites from Arkansas. Similar local materials were used
to make a variety of crude tools and a few well-made thin blades
(Table 8); a progressive preference for cherts instead of petrified
wood was shown. Most of their tools apparently related to hunting

or grinding (seeds) or nutting; wood-working tools like adzes or
gouges were rare, as were drills and gravers, and any manufacturing
other than of basic tools was minimal. These people were attending
to the business of food gathering and everyday living with few fi’ills,
even of ornamentation (other than red oeher) or eeremonia! nature.
Into this drab basic technology ideas or items of pottery-making
were introduced from the lower Mississippi Valley, presumably
making their way aeross the coast to the Sabine River and up this
stream to the site. Typieal Tchefuncte pottery (Fig. 9, 10) with linear
triangle stamping, drag-and-jab incising, nail pinehing, ring and
polypodal basal supports and extended bases, tempered with clay or
sand, were brought in. The specimens available offer no clue to the
site of manufacture of this ware, whether locally, on the eoast, or in
the lower valley, but sites of the Tchefunete period are known on "the
lower Sabine.
By the next period, however, vessels with Marksville decoration
appear, some of them made of pastes in the local fashion of bone tempering and use of clays with hematite impurities. Incising, stamping
in bands outlined by deeply trailed lines, the use of serrated or
"dentate" tools, and characteristic shapes are indicative of these
wares (Fig. 10). Heavy trailed incising of large bone-tempered vessels
may have started at this time or a little later. Archaic technology in
manufacture of everyday tools and projectile points was unchanged,
except for a more limited variety (Table 8); most of the points were
Gary or Ellis types. Grinding and nutting tools increased in usage and
probably exotic objects like quartz crystals and galena were brought
in. The small polished stone cups were probably made at this trine, if
we may judge by customs elsewhere during this period; the placement

102

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

of these objects in the midden allows for this interpretation. The Coral
Snake Mound, 75 miles downstream from Resch site, attests to the
presence of people with Marksville culture located well up the Sabine
River.
There are ephemeral evidences that the succeeding culture period
in the lower Mississippi Valley, Troyville, was represented at tlesch
site. Sherds which were stmnped with a straight bar instead of a
notched tool (Fig. 10 k-n) and one sherd each of Yokena Incised and
Churupa Punetated are types which are more often attributed to Troyville than to Marksville ceramic complex, although these decorative
elements are present in both.
A major change now becomes evident at the site (Table 8), with
the introduction of the bow and arrow and a rapid decrease in dart
projectile points as well as chipped stone tools. We cannot say with
certainty whether these occurred at the time of introduction of Troyville or of Coles Creek ceramics, in view of the small number of
distinctive sherds and the vertical sherd displacement in the midden.
We do know that the middle midden levels, 4 and 5, mark the peak
of Coles Creek sherds, that arrow points are established at these
levels, and that Archaic dart points and thiek cutting-chopping tools
are fading out. Grinding and pitted stones increase and the inference is
of lessened dependence on hunting aetivities. Presumably agriculture
had arrived, but the nature of oecupation at the site, light and ostensibly sporadic, seems unehanged and the site was probably still used
as a nut-gathering station.
The final occupation of the site was by early Caddoan peoples, of
Alto Focus affiliation (Table 8). They frequented the site snore than
had the Coles Creek people and may have coexisted with them, if
we may put any reliance on sherd stratigraphy. They were the best
potters at the site, introducing the bottle and carinated bowl forms
and, along with the Coles Creek potters, snaking jars with high and
outward flaring rims. Decoration with a variety of techniques included
the innovations of brushing and engraving. However, they maintained
the bone, clay and sand tempering traditions, using them in this order
of frequency. A lesser but still considerable number of vessels were
plain and "flowerpot" vessels were still made. How much Archaic
technology persisted in the manufacture of tools is conjectural, as the
evidence at this site is unclear, but it was minimal if present. They
were using the bow with an’ows which were tipped with small flake
points, but small Gary points may still have been used at times.
There seems no doubt that the use of pitted stones and other ground
stone tools was still in vogue, that nuts were still roasted, and there

THE

SITE

is no evidence that their usage of the site differed from that of the
former peoples.
The early Caddoan occupation of the site terminated its aboriginal
occupation; thereafter it remained deserted until European settlement. Occupation of the valley continued, however, and the occupation now seems to have been in permanent small settlements by Caddoan peoples, with mound-building and burials in mounds and cemeteries. In succession, the Old Brown Place, the two sites on Jones
Ranch, Reseh Burial Mound, Susie Slade site and Henry Brown sites
1 and 2 show shifting but continuous occupation during middle and
late Caddoan times. They shifted in use of the valley from seasonal
visits to continuous occupation in small settlements but their pottery
shows continuity with the Reseh site in the use of bone and grit tempering in the pastes, hence we infer no advent of new peoples. Fully
developed agriculture is to be assumed, with cessation of the annual
round.
In conclusion, trends of significance which we infer at this site are:
(1) usage of the site over thousands of years as a specialized area in
the forest-exploiting economy, for the primal7 purpose of gathering
nuts; (2) the persistence of Archaic tool and projectile point typology,
and presumably of basic food-gathering techniques, for centuries after
introduction of pottery; (3) the development of an areal ceramic
tradition, beginning before the time of Christ, with simple vessel
forms, flat or rounded bases, largely plain but a small amount deeorated, made of paste tempered with sand, bone and clay, which
tradition lasted long after introduction of more sophisticated ceramics;
(4) introduction in sequence of the ceramic complexes of the lower
Mississippi Valley, from Tehefuncte through Coles Creek, into this
area of east Texas, presumably via coastal spread and up the Sabine
River; (5) eventual replacement of Archaic traditions and teehnology
by the bow and arrow, agriculture and small tool technology and (6)
desertion of the site after early Caddoan times, as permanent settlements elsewhere in the valley with mound building, ceremonial
activities and cemetery burial, centered around an agricultural economy replaced the seasonal round and dependence on forest exploitation.
