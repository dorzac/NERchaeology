Preface
This report was originally prepared as a deliverable for Fort Polk, under
contract to 出e U. S. Army Corps ofEngineers , Fort Worth District, Contract No.
DACA63-95-D-0051 , Delivery Order No. 0008 , and under subcontract to
Prewitt and As sociates , Inc. , Austin, Texas. The period of performance of the
project was 2 December 1996 to 15 November 1999. Because of time and 妃，
source constraints inherent in the original project, it was not possible to realize
and indude certain potential, desirable components and aspects: brief descriptions
of thin-section petrography of map units; examples of typicallog responses of
mapped surface Il nits in the subsurface , for indusion in Appendix B or addition as
a separate appendix; depictions of electric-log traces , of dashed contacts in plac白，
and of the extents of surf主.ce casings , on the subsurface geologic cross sections in
Appendix B; and the connection of our surface observations to a regional subsurface depositional framework.
The last of these items is perhaps the most substantive, though actual regional
characterization of subsurface units utilizing electric-log data for an area encompassing the Fort Polk region , induding mapping of gross e-log facies and inferred
depositional environments for selected units , was never within the scope of the
present work. And unfortunately, we were unable to fìnd available in the public
domain any results of such investigation with which to integrate the present
study. To our knowledge, the dosest thing to this type of investigation is in the
work ofJones (1977) who , rather than mapping facies within stratigraphically
defìned units , used a slice-mapping technique to delineate major sand axl臼1ll
different portions of the total Fleming-W i1lis inte凹al. Jones's maps , however,
contain a large area of no data, corresponding to almost the entire northeastern
half ofVernon Parish, which indudes ne缸片 the entire 叹时y area of this investigation. Whi1e detailed regional depositional-systems characterizations of the
subsurface Wilcox, Catahoula-Frio , and Fleming have been done comprehensively in the 卫xas coastal plain eastward to the Sabine River, no analogous work is
publidy available for onshore southwestern and west-central Louisiana. Such a
subsurface framework would provide a much-needed 1arger context into which
the surface observations of this investigation could be integrated, as Ís noted in
the text and in Appendix B.

Abstract
The Fort Po1k region is underlain by Cenozoic terrigenous sediment comprising mostly the Oligocene Catahoula Formation, six formation-ran1王 subunits of
the Fleming (Miocene) , and Holocene alluvium. Pliocene and Quaternary surfacestratigraphic units incise older units. These surface Cenozoic strata show gentle ,
homoclin a1 dip toward the Gulf of Mexico basin and record deposition transition a1 between continenta1 and sha110w-marine, but they are dominantly
progradationa1 and increasingly terrestri a1 upsection. The Miocene units comprise
a1 ternating coarser-grained, fluvi a1-dominated lithofacies and finer-grained , more
marine-influenced lithofacies.
Gentle dips , semiconsolidated sediment, thick soils , and vegetation generally
do not permit direct recognition of surface structure. Drainage lineaments , though
suggestive of joint control of drainage , show no clear relation to strikes of mea回
sured systematic joints.
The prima可 nonfuel minera1 commodity of economic significance, aside
from ground water, is gravel. Gravel occurs primarily in the upper Willis , assigned
here to the upper Pliocene. Younger Quaternary units have varying but lesser
potentia1 for gravel.
Flooding is the sole geologic haz缸d. Flood-hazard potentia1 was compiled
from Federa1 Emergency Management Agency data and modified based on floodplain topography. Landslide potentia1, inferred from steepest slopes and clayey
substrates , is insufficient to constitute a hazard.

M. Earl Stew凹， wildlife biologist wi出 the U. S. Department of Agriculture,
provided access to aerial photos and maps in the files of the National Forest
Service，民rnon Ranger District, Kisatchie National Forest. The following employees of timber companies active in the study 红ea helped provide critical access to
large tracts of nonmilitary land: Robert H. Crosby of Crosby Land and Resources ,
Mandeville, Louisiana; Darwin Foster ofTemple Inland Inc. , Diboll , Texas; Mike
Hudson of the Temple Inland Inc. office in De Ridder, Louisiana, who gave a

Finally, acknowledgment is made to two geologists who have had a positive
shaping influence on this work through their previous investigations and their
helpful conversations about them over a period of some fì丘een years: the late H. V.
Andersen (Professor Emeritus , LSU Department of Geology & Geophysics) , who
mapped the geology of Sabine and Natchitoches parishes , and James E. Rogers
(U.S. Geological Survey retir吐， now a consulting ground-water hydrologist) , who
has investigated the surface and sha110w-subsurf主.ce geology in 民rnon Parish and
many other parts of the state. Each spent decades working in his respective areas.
The basic framework of pre-Plio-Pleistocene geology available in our study area in
由e years since the mapping of Rapides and Vernon parishes by Fisk and Welch,
and prior to the work of Hinds-a framework within which we were fortunate to
be able to conduct our investigation-was laid princip a11y by these two geologists.
Where our own observations (exposures and/or access) and the information
available to us have proved inadequate or inconclusive , we have genera11y deferred
to a previous map interpretation made by one of them. It is our hope to have done
so no more than was necessary and appropriate. We are a1so indebted to Rogers for
丘uitful consultation and for his comprehensive technic a1 review of the dra丘
version of the report delivered to the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers; nevertheless ,
we are of course wholly responsible for a11 aspects of the present document and its
accompanying plates.

The study area, herein termed the
Fort Polk region, comprises the ten
7.5-minute quadrangl白白compass­
ing the Fort Polk Military Reservation
and the Peason Ridge Milita可
Installation, in portions of Sabine,
Natchitoches, and Vernon parish口，
Louisíana (fìgures 1, 2).

Purpose
Theo问ectives of this 血ve吨ation
were threefold. The fìrst was to províde
由巳 U.S. Army at Fort Polk wíth basíc
geologic data essential to the environmental applicatíons of its ongoing
environmental prograrns. Next was to
con由me and enl红geupon 由eworkof
Hinds (1997a, b; 1998a, b, c; 1999)
toward providíng a more detaíled
stratigraphic and geologíc context and
frarnework for the Miocene vertebrate
fossillocalítíes recently díscovered at
Fort Polk and investigated by Schiebout
(1994, 1997; Schiebout et al. 1996).
Finally; the work contínues and

and trails , with natural exposures most abundant along the beds, cutbanks , and
valley walls of streams and rívers. The overwhelming majoríty of exposures
exarníned for thís investígatíon comprised those of a small and ínconspicuous
nature in the dítches along roads, although the better exposures íncluded roadcuts
and natural blufl云， some sizable. An a町empt was made to cover all roads accessible
wíth a standard four-wheel-drive vehicle and selectively to gain access to intervening areas on foot where exposures appeared likely.
Notes were recorded on copies of the topographic base maps for each of the
ten 7 .5 -minute quadrangles in the study area and in fìeld books. Field observations were used to díscriminate areas of consistent gross lithology and internal
features to delineate the dífferent map-unit polygons, the boundaries of which
were fìtted to the topography as much as possible. The interpreted polygons were
then selectively checked agaínst aerial photography; including principally that used
as a base for soils mapping by the Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS) [formerly Soil Conservation Service (SCS) ], and against soils mapping
and data included in NRCS/SCS parish soil surve严岛r Sabine, Natchitoches, and
飞lernon parishes.
Pliocene units, and Pleistocene units associated with terrace surfaces , were
found to be dívisible into three maín groups: Upland, Intermedíate, and Prairie.
As indicated by Snead and others (1 998) , their characteristics are suitable for
informal classi自cation as allogroups (units characterized by bounding
unconformities) , and this was the approach used in this investigatíon.

Methodology
Access to military land in the
study area was coordinated primarily through the Fort Poll王Range
Control office , and access to
nonmilitary propertíes was obtaíned príncípally through
coordinatíon with tímber comp公
nies and hunting clubs. Field work
was conducted in excursions 丘Olll
several days to two weeks ín
duratíon. The wídespread presence
of thick vegetation and surfìcial
deposits covering the stratígraphic
uníts mapped for thís ínvestigatíon
is such that exposures are generally
scarce. Ar tifìcial exposures occur
with greatest frequency along roads

Alluvium underlies the bottomlands of streams and their upland
tributaries. Because these are incised

surrOlmding uplands, alluvium cou1d

mapping alluviurn is the most
systematic and provides the greatest

constituent geomorphicldepositional

therefore, all 由e sw四malluvium

Previous Work
The basic 仕amework of pre-PlioPleistocene geology in the study area
is , for the Miocene, the work of
Welch (1942) as emended by Rogers
(1980) and Hinds (1998a, b, c; 1999)
and, for the Eocene and Oligocene,
that of An dersen (1 960 , 1993). The
primary foundation for the present
study was origina1ly laid by Fisk
(1 940) and by his student 耐ch
(1 942). Fisk (1 940) introduced 出e
sixfold subdivision used for the
surface and near-surface Miocene
Fleming as part of his investigation of
the geology of Rapides 但ld Avoyelles
parishes to 出e east, and Welch
(1942) applied this framework in his
investigation of the geology ofVernon
Parish. Welch did his fìeld work
principally in the 1ate 1930s, at a time
when much ofVernon Parish was
clear-cut by timber interests, but he
had essenti a1ly no topographic control
with which to guide the rendering of
his observations and interpretations.
W句tson and Ki rksey (1 963)
conducted photogeologic mapping of
a large area in west-central Lo uisiana
扭d adjacent Texas for Sindair Oil &
Gas Company, supplemented with
extensive fìeld checking. The study
area encompassed portions of two
Texas counties and four Louisiana
parishes, and it included all ofVernon
Parish凰 Their investigation was done
at 扭 impressive level of detail,
although it appears that at least some
of their photogeologic map units were
defìned diff时ntly 丘om the
stratigraphica1ly defìned units
mapped for this investigation.
Rogers and Calandro (1965)
revised the mapping ofV吐non Parish
geology from that ofWelch (1 942) ,
based primarily on shallow-subsurface
data from water wel1s. Rogers (1980)
continued this revision based on both
water well data and fìeld checking,
and his rendering ofVernon Parish
geology was used for 也e 1984
compilation of the 1:500,000-scale
Geologic Jt/Iap ofLouisiana. The

mapping of pre-Pliocene Neogene
(Fleming) and uppermost Paleogene
Tertiary (Catahoula) units by Rogers
(1 980) and Rogers and Calandro
(196步) served as the overall base from
which this investigation began. This
investigation follows especially dosely
Rogers's (1 980) mapping of the Lena
Formation of the Fleming Group.
Though the Lena is relatively well
exposed, it has a narrow outcrop belt
and can be distinguished 丘om
adjacent units more by its somewhat
higher proportions of fìner-grained
textures than by any suite of lithologies that could be considered
diagnostic; thus , we were unable to
improve on his mapping of it.
Andersen (1 960, 1993) mapped
the geology of Sabine and
Natchitoches parishes , the southernmost portions of which overlap the
study area of this investigation.
Andersen did not subdivide the
Fleming, combining it with 出e
Catahoula as "Miocene (Undifferentiated)." This investigation follows very
dosely his mapping of the older
Paleogene Tertia可 units (Cockfìeld,
Jackson, Vicksburg) in the northernmost and northwesternmost reaches
of the study area because of extremely
sp红se exposures there.
Schiebout (1 994 , 1997;
Schiebout et al. 1996) has elaborated
anew 扭d growing biostratigraphic
framework for the Miocene of Fort
Polk and the surrounding region ,
following 出e recent discovery of
vertebrate fossils in the Castor Creek
Formation of the Fleming Group on
Fort Polk. Her investigations of these
fossils and the need to place them in a
more detailed geologic framework
provided the main impetus for the
work ofHinds (l 997a, b; 1998a, b, c;
1999) and led to U. S. Geological
Survey support for his work under its
Geologic Mapping Education
Program (EDMAP). Because of
overlap of the periods of performance
ofHinds's project and ours , we were
privileged to engage with him in an

ongoing dialogue and to participate
jointly in the accumulation of new
observations and evolution of concepts regarding their interpretation.
For Hinds and the present authors ,
our situation was essentially the
reverse of that obtaining during the
work ofWelch (1 942): we had good,
detailed, and comprehensive topographic control, available as the
7 .5 -minute quadrangles used as base
maps, but a general scarcity of
exposures. Early in the conduct of
this investigation 出e mapping of
Hinds (1 998b, c) was st山 in progress;
in ongoing consultations with him
and wi也 Fort Polk it was agreed to
incorporate his 岛1iocene unit contacts
in our mapping for the portion of our
study area overlapped by his , and to
focus our efforts primarily on other
parts of the Fort Polk region. We have
done so with minimal revision,
al出ough in places our mapping
makes substantial revisions to his
Plio-Pleistocene contacts.
Prior to the recent work of Hinds
(1998a, b, C; 1999) the only refìnements ofWelch's (1 942) origin址
Plio-Pleistocene 丘amework of the
area th红飞时注 601:h publidy available

were Andersen (1 960) and Bi在nchi
(1 982). Rogers (1 982 , personal
communication 1993) had suggested
for many years the potential for the
occurrence of surface Pliocene strata
in the area based on lithological
characteristics and elevation of the
older and higher Ci tronelle-type
remnants, and he had led the present
authors and Hinds to some of the
better candidate examples on di能r­
ent occasions beginning in 1993.
Snead and others (1 998) utilized both
the mappÎng ofHinds (1 998b, c) and
preliminary results 仕om this investigation-principally those relating to
the postulated presence of surface
Pliocene strata-in their preparation
of a Quaternary Geologic M与pof

Problems of Observation and Interpretation
Problems encountered in the conduct of the work der如ed primarily from the
scarcity of exposures. In addition to being general1y scarce and largely inconspicuous , exposures in the study area also tend to have an ephemeral character except
where they are 丘equently renewed by stream erosion or road-related maintenance.
(This was illustrated to the authors when they to01王 David Hinds to see some
joints measured less than two months earlier ín a road ditch in the Lacamp
quadrangle [NW], only to find 也e exposure now covered with deadwood and
redeposited sediment.) Additionally, repetitious textures occur in sedíment of all
agl臼In由e study area; virtually al1 strata consist of sediment of the same basic
types , comprising sand , si1t , and day in va可ing proportions , reflecting the repetí-

tive recyding of terrigenous material
through tíme and blurring possible
lithologic distinctions. The dosest
thing to a diagnostic lithology ís the
calcareous-nodule-bearing day of the
finer-grained Fleming subunits ,
though such day may also occur wi出
lesser 丘equency in certain of the
coarser-grained subunits. The members of the Fleming defined by Fisk
(1940) constitute gross li由ofå.cies ，
and though they m叮 approximate
lithostratigraphic units locally，由ey
红e identified primarily on the basis of
gross lithology and position in the
stratigraphic sequence.
The generally unfossi1iferous
nature of the Catahoula Formation
and younger strata of the surf主ce and
shallow subsurface is such that foss i1s
are largely unavailable to help with
the problems of identifìcation and
dassifìcation. The only potential
guide fossi1s 红e represented by
Potamides matsoni and its associated
fauna, reported by others from the
Castor Creek Formation of the
Flerning Group (Fisk 1940, in
Rapides Parish; and Welch 1942,
from a hand-auger borehole in
Vernon Parish) , but not obse凹ed by
Jones and others (1 995) , Hinds
(1998a, 1999) , or by us in the course
of recent investigatíons.
The sediment composing the
stratigraphic units in the study area is
genera1ly poorly consolidated and
heavi1y weathered in places. Lithifìed
rock, primarily sandstone, occurs
with noteworthy frequency only in
出e Catahoula and Carnahan Bayou
Formatíons. Al l the map units of the
landscape except for Holocene
alluvium are routinely mantled by
veneers of surfìcial units (fìgure 当) ;

to those more characteristic of the Miocene. The Catahoula can a1so be heavily
oxidized and resemble the Plio-Pleistocene locally.
The irregular ∞n直伊ration， wi也 potentially substantial relief, of the base of the
older and geomorphically higher of the Pliocene and Pleistocene units (出ose classifìed
herein as subunits of the Willis and Lissie) , together with the low structural dip of the
underl抖ng Tertiary units, can also present problems of interpretation. For some areas
there 红e indications that narrow tracts ofMio臼ne may be exposed along the escarpmen臼 delineating 皿ds叩缸缸ing the overlying Plio-Pleistocene units, but it was not
practicable to ground-truth them all. Such narrow tracts ofMiocene sediment
probably occur mosdy in areas where subunits of the Willis and Lissie are the main
map units. For example, a few such occurrences of the Blot日1臼 Creek Formation of
the Fleming Group were observed in 由.e Fullerton Lake quadrangle [NE] and may be
more numerous in that ar四由an depicted.
We consulted subsur也ce information, prim缸ily electric logs of water wells
and oil and gas wells, in an attempt to provide an independent constraint on the
mapping of the surf主ce units. Typic a11y (though not uniformly) ，出e depth distribution of subsurface information in

became modi自ed to focus on complementing the subsurface work a1 ready presented by Rogers and C a1andro (1 965) and Hinds (1 998a, 1999), and on
determining the precise stratigraphic posítion within the Castor Creek interval of
the conglomerate beds containing the vertebrate fossil accumulations desc出ed by
Schiebout (1 994, 1997; Schiebout et a1. 1996).
In addition to the above problems of interpretive lithostratigraphy, the
stratigraphic classifìcation of many of the units mapped for this investigation is
beset by long-standing problems and controversies relating to their age, because no
unequivoca1 age-diagnostic faunas are known from their updip portions. The older
units of the strata herein given the genera1 designation "Plio-Pleistocene"
[Citronelle-equiva1ent = Upland Complex ofHinds 1998a, 1999] and comprising
subunits of the Willis as used herein have been classifìed exclusively as either
P1iocene or Pleistocene by various workers in the past. Hinds (1 998a, 1999)
reviewed the context ofFisk's (1938) probable predisposition toward a Pleistocene
classifìcation of these units in Louisiana; such predisposition over the last several
decades co u1d have created an apparent dear出 of surface Pliocene strata as an
artifact of the classifìcation prevailing here. These units are herein given a Pliocene
classifìcation, as inferred from aspects of their distribution in three dimensions and
in accordance with the ideas ofRogers (1982 , persona1 communication 1993) and
Hinds (1998a, 1999). The Cataho u1a Formation has a tradition ofbeing classi在ed
as 鸟也oc巳ne among surf汪ce mappers (e.g叮 Andersen 1960 and 1993), whereas its
accepted subsurface equiva1ents (Frio and Anahuac) have long been classifìed as
Oligocene. The va1 idity of the correlation of these surface and subsurface units ,
and the accuracy of the relative-age dating of the subsurface Frio and An ahuac as
Oligocene by foraminifer a1 microp a1eontolo gy, are both upheld despite decades of
these two different usages. We therefore follow the interpretation of Galloway
(1 977) and Galloway and others (1982) , as was done by Hinds (1 998a, 1999) and
tentatively by Snead and McCu110h (1984) , and accordingly classify 出e Cataho u1a
as Oligocene.
An added operationa1 complication was presented by the age of the editions of
the base maps used for the fìeld work, which date from the early 1950s, early

Physiography
The study region lies in the West Gulf Coasta1 section ofThornbury's (1965)
Coasta1 Plain Province. It consists of coast-para11el Qllaternary terraces a10ng its
seaward edge and deeply dissected Tertiary uplands characterized by a serÌ es of
coast-para11el cuestas and lowlands inland of the terraces. The cuestas are commonly called ‘ 'wolds" and the lowlands 红e less commonly called "va1es." The
cllestas have st巳ep inJand-facing escarpments and slope gulhvardo Erosionally
resistant glllfward-dipping strata create these cuestas. This belted topography is less
well developed in the West Gulf Co asta1 section than it is in the Coasta1 Plain
Province east of the Mississippi River (Mllrray 1961; Thornbury 1965).
Within the West Gulf Coasta1 section, the Fort Polk region lies at the boundary between the coast-parallel terraces and the belted llplands between the Sabine
and C a1casieu river va11eys. The section's southernmost cuesta, called the
"Kisatchie Wold," a1most completely dominates this region, where it consists of
two distinct cuestas. Only a ve可 sma11 part of the coast-parallel terraces lies within
the stlldy region. All llvi a1 va11eys of local streams and rivers that drain the Fort
Poll( region are an addition a1 and signi且cant part of the physiography.
The southern of the two cuesωof the Kisatchie Wold encompassω a11 of the
main post of the military base and most of the Birds Creek, Fort Polk, Fullerton
Lake , Lacan甲， Slagle，四d Simpson South quadrangles. The sOllthern edge of this
cuesta is a well-defìned esc缸pment 30 to 50 丘。 to 15 m) high. This escarpment
separates 由e highly dissected cuesta 丘om the flatter, less dissected coast-parallel
terrace surface to the sOllth. Except in the Fullerton La1(e quadrangle, this escarpment lies south and Ollt of the study region. The northern bOllndary of this cuesta
is a coast四 and strike-para1lellowland occupied by the a1111via1 valleys ofBayou
Castor, Cypress Creek, and an east伊west segment of the C a1casiell River.
The southern cuesta rises in elevation 丘om abollt 270 to 290 丘 (82 to 88 m)
a10ng its southern edge to an elevation of 400 to 440 丘(1 22 to 134 m) a10ng its
crest. Northward of this crest, it drops rapidly into the lowland formed by 由e
valleys ofBayoll Castor, Cypress Creek, and the C a1casiell River. The sOllthern
cllesta is deepJy dissected bya se tÌes of northwest-southeast trending drainages.
Topographic profìles a10ng the crests of ridges between the major drainages show
that the

Coast-parallel terraces , which
comprise the southern fìfth of the
West Gulf Coastal section, were
mapped only within southern and
eastern parts of the Fullerton Lake
quadrangle. This study recognizes two
terrace surf主.ces， which represent
separate members of the LÏssie
Allogroup. The higher and older
terrace surface forms a n红row belt ,
about 0.8 to 1. 3 miles (1. 3 to 2.1 km)
wide, that lies between the KÌsatchie
Woldand 出e lower terrace. It is
dissected, but unlike the KÌsatchie
Wold it still retains large remnants of
its original terrace surf主ce， and it has
far less relief. The lower and younger
terrac在 surface is the northern edge of
an extensive , gulfward-dipping terrace
that extends southward from 出ε
study region into Calcasieu Parish.
Except where it is 0能et by fault-line
scarps，出is terrace surface dips
g吐fward at 4 ft/mi (0.8 m/km).
The local stream and river valleys
红e also dominant features of 由ε
regional physiography. They deeply
díssect 出e be1ted topography of the
Tertiary uplands and the Pleistocene
coast-parallel terraces. Within the
Tertiary Upland, coalesced valleys
form the lowlands separatillg 出巳
cuestas. The drainages associated with
these valleys belong to one of three
major drainage basills present within
the Fort Polk region: the Sabine,
Calcasieu, and Red river basins.
Tributaries of the Sabine River
drain the western edges of both the
southern and northern cues阳 (fìgure
7). Bayou Zo urie, Cypress Creek,
Dowden Creek, and other tributaries
of An acoco Bayou draill the northW臼tern corner of the Fort Poll王
quadrangle, the w臼tern edge of both

the Slagle and Kurthwood quadrangles , all but the northeast corner of
出e Oowden Creek quadrangle , and
southwestern part of the Peason
quadrangle. The valley of Cypress
Creek, forms part of the lowlands that
separate the southern and 1l0rthern
cuestas. The northwestern part of the
Peason quadrangle is drained by
Goodson Creek, a tributary of Bayou
Toro. The valley of Goodson Creek,
like the valley of Cypress Creek,
forms part of a prominent coastparallellowland valley lyillg at the
base of a cuestàs i1l1alld-facing
esc红pment.

The Calcasieu River and its
tributaries draill the central p红t of
由e study area betweell the southern
四dno时lern cuestω(fìgure 7). The
major drainage within this area is the
Calcasieu River. It occupies a valley
that lies at the base of the steep nor也­
facillg slope of the southern cuesta
within the Simpson South and Slagle
quadrangles. North of the Calcasieu
River, Comrade Creek drains parts of
the eastern Kurthwood quadrangle,
induding the southeasternmost
corner of the Peason Ridge Military
Reservation.
The remainder of the Fort Polk
region is draíned by tríbutaries一
Ki satchie Bayou and Middle
Creek-of the Red River (fìgure 7).
KÌsatchie Bayou drains most of the
KJsatchie quadrangle, the northern
edge of the Kurthwood quadrangle,
the northeast corner ûf û~e Dûwden
Creek quadrallg1e, and 出e eastern
half of the Peason quadrangle. Middle
Creek drains a small arcuate slice of
the northern edge of the Peason and
Kisatchie quadrangles. The valley of
Middle Creek forms a coast-parallel

lowland 由at

forms the northern
boundary of the KÌsatchie Wold.
The KÌsatchie 15-minute quadrangle provides unmistakable
evidence that KÌsatchie Bayou was
on臼 a major tributary of the
Calcasieu River (Andersen 1993).
The evidence indudes a large wind
gap sep红ating Oevil's Creelζand
Bayou I.: Ivrogne, both of which are
noticeably underfìt for the valleys that
they currently occu冉As noted by
An dersen.(1993) , the northwestsoutheast-trending segment of
KÌsatchie Bayou exhibits a barbed
drainage pattern, which implies that
this segment of KÌsatchie Bayou once
flowed southeastward into Bayou
I.: Ivrogne across the wind gap alld
down Devil's Cred王 to Comrade
Creek. It is obvious that KÌsatchie
Bayou once flowed southward into
the Calcasieu River until pirated by a
tributary of the Re d River.

Climatology
The Fort Polk region h臼 ahumid
subtropical dimate. Moist, subtropical air masses 丘om the Gulf of
Mexico dominate the region's dimate,
particularly in the summer. Because it
lies 50 to 110 miles (80 to approximately 180 km) inland from the Gulf
of 岛1exico， drier continental air
masses from the west and north
signifìc皿tly influence the Fort Polk
region. As a result, its climate is drier
than that experienced along the Gulf
Coast to the south (Louisiana Offìce
of State Climatology n.d.).
During the summer, temperatures are typically very w缸'm.
Daytime maximum temperatures
average 90 0 F (32 0 C) or above 丘om
June into early September. Days with
maximum temperatures above 1000 F
(38 0 C) are not r征'e and 0丘en occur in
runs of two to three days in a row.
Because of the high humidity, heat
indices or apparent temperatures
above 1100 F (43 0 C) are frequent
during these heat spells. As in the
winter, summer maximum and
minimum temperatures usually show
ar阻ge of 20 0 F (11 OC) (Lo山slana
Offìce of State Climatology n.d.).
Winter temperatures are typically
mild. The average monthly minimum
temperatures for the winter months
红e all above freezing. However,
common cold spells with rare periods
of sub-freezing weather occur with
polar outbreaks. The duration of
extremely cold weather is typically
short; in rare winters，由ey might last
from several days to as long as a 岳w
weeks. January is typically the coldest
month (Louisiana Office of State
Climatology n.d.).
Precipitation occurs throughout
由ey'四r with recordable rainfall
occurring on about 100 days during a
typical year. According to monthly
average precipitation 刨出s， rainfall is
well rustributed throughout the year,
Wl出 summer and fall months the
dri臼t part of the year. Typical weather

patterns consist of frontal rain in the
fall, winter, and spring, including
possible but rare snow and sleet in the
winter. Frontal storms can produce
damaging ice storms in the winter
and other hazardous weather
throughout the year. Thunderstorms
also produce precipitation throughout
the year, but most commonly during
出e summer. Frontal thunderstorms
and squalls, which occur most
frequently during the spring and fall,
m可 cause locally heavy rainfall,
regional flooding, high winds,
dangerous lightning, hail, and
tornadoes. On average, about 50
inches (127 cm) of rain falls per year
with as much 80 inches (203 cm) and
as little as 30 inches (76 cm) in any
year (Louisiana Office of State
Climatology n.d.).

Flora and Fauna
The Fort Polk region lies within
Gulf Coast Plain Longleaf
Pine Forest region. The upland forests
of this region 征e characterized by
longleaf pine forest with m习 or stands
of slash pine and oaks. In its virgin
state, the longleaf pine forest consisted of almost pure , open, parklike
stands of longleaf pine with a scattering of shortleaf and loblolly pine and
a highly ruverse understorγof
bluestem grasses. The exceptionally
rich understory of the longleaf pine
forest was dominated by grasses ,
composites, legumes, and a wide
assortment of other forbs. As sociated
with the upland longleaf pine forests
were the hillside bogs , wooded seeps,
sandy woodlands, and the very rare
calcareous prairie natural communitÍ es. The longleaf pine forest has been
replaced by slash pine and loblolly
pine thwughout much of the Fort
Pollc region as a result of logging and
reforestation. The virgin forests of the
area were completely logged between
the 1890s and 1930s. Starting in the
1950s, large p红ts of the longleaf pine
forests have been converted to pine
plantations devoted to the agricultural
theW白t

production of pwp wood and other
paper products (Martin and Smith
1991; Cantley et al1993).
The mixed hardwood-loblol1y
pine forest and shortleaf pine/oakhickory forest natural communities
characterize the h i1ls1opes and terraces
located between the upland longleaf
pine forests and the bottomlands of
the Fort Polk region. The mixed
hardwood-loblolly pine forest consists
of a variable mixture of hardwoods ,
iιvarious oaks and hickories , and a
signifìcant percentage of loblolly pine.
Within the mixed hardwood-loblolly
pine forest, dogwood, redbud,
persimmon , black cherry, and other
woody shrubs form a midstory
canop严 The shortleaf pine/oakhickory forest is an open-canopied,
moderately dense forest composed of
shortleaf pine and various hardwoods.
This type of forest is associated with
the xeric to 世y-m臼ic upper and
middle slopes and hilltops found
within the study region. This natural
community has thick middle and
understotγcomponents composed of
small trees and vines. The herbaceous
ground cover is sp缸se to moderate in
extent. The wooded seeps natural
community also occurs on the
hillslopes within the Fort Polk region
(Martin and Smith 1991; Cantleyet
al1993).
The riparian forest natural
community occupies 出e na口ow
flood plain of permanent small to
intermediate streams within the Fort
Polk region. This natural community
contains a wide variety of hardwood
species , induding three species of
maple , two species of hickory,
persimmon ，也ree species of ash ,
black walnut, sycamore , seven species
of oal王， and four species ûf elm.
W'here a dosed canopy is present, the
understory is open and parklike and
contains relatively few shrubs and
regenerating trees. W'here the canopy
is open, the riparian forest 0丘en
contains a fairly dense midstory and

understory composed of a wide
variety of shrubs , trees , and vines
(Martin and Smith 1991; Cantley et
al 1993).
A diverse natural fauna inhabits
the local natural communities. This
fauna includes 40 species of mammals , 7 species of Iizards, 23 species of
snakes , 10 species of turtles , 9 species
of salamanders , 13 species of 丘ogs
and toads，皿d 223 species of birds.
The mammals that can be found in
the Fort Polk region indude whitetailed deer, nine-banded armadillo ,
opossum, spo忧ed skunk, striped
skunk, woodland vole , cottontail and
swamp rabbits , and gray and fox
squirrels. The important predator
mammals found within these forests
are red fox, gray fox, mink, bobcat,
raccoon , long-tailed weasel , and the
endangered and regional1y expatriated
red wolf (Martin and Smith 1991;
Tomas 1978).

The composite stratigraphic column for the Fort Poll王 region， with the
classifìcation of units used herein, is given in Table 1. Figure 11 is a composite
graphic log of the stratigraphic column. The Paleogene units of the Tertia可，
represented in the study area by Eocene and Oligocene strata, follow the classifìcation employed by Andersen (1%0 , 1993); 也e exception is that 出e Catahoula
Formation is here assigned to 由e Oligocene ，也llowing 由e interpretation of
Galloway (1 977, his fìgure 2) and Galloway and others (1982, their fìgure 坷， as
mentioned in the introduction. The older Neogene units , represented by Miocene
strata, follow the classifìcation devised by Fisk (1 940) in Rapid臼 Parish and
employed by Welch (1942) in Vernon Parish, with the exception noted below of
adopting usage (suggested by Rogers 1999) reflecting 出e group rank of the
Fleming and formation ranl王 of its constituent subunits. The classifìcation of
Pliocene and Pleistocene srrata elaborates fur出er the work of Snead and others
(1 998) in large1y following and derivi吨 from usage established in a句 acent
portions of eastern Texas for the pre-Prairie units. This schema was found to be
the most natural and readily applicable , considering the number and threedimensional distribution of inferred Pliocene 皿d Pleistocene units found in the
study area. Wh ile no independent control is available on the age of inferred
surface Pliocene strata, the distribution of the two m aÍn constituent
lithostratigraphic units recognized in relation to 出e younger Pleistocene units
(older, stratigraphically lower，皿d geomorphically higher sandy facies and
younger, stratigraphically higher, and geomorphically lower gravelly facies) makes
出is a plausible in公rence， as outlined in the Pliocene Series section below.
Munsell color determinations , which were routinely made for sediment
composing the various surface-stratigraphic units , became quite numerous for the
Catahoula Formation and formatÍ ons of the Fleming Group, and there was no
clear, sensible synthesis of the color designations for these units , for inclusion in
the narrative. For this reason , Munsell colors determined for Catahoula and
Fleming sediments are listed separately in Appendix A by portions of quadrangles ,
approximately from southwest to northeast along the outcrop belts of the various
U ll1 ts.

Tertiary System
Eocene Series
Claibome Group
Coc伊'eld Fonnation
The Cockfìeld Formatìon crops
out in a small portion of the study
atea at its northwesternmost edge ,
and within this area the formation is
ve可 poorly exposed. The authors
were able to examine only t\vo
limited exposures of this unit,
comprising very fine sand of generally
grayish to grayish brown coloratìon.
For these reasons we have followed
An dersen's (1%0 , 1993) mapping of
the Cockfìeld, as well as of the
superjacent Jackson and Vicksburg
groups , ve可 dosely. Andersen notes
that above its basa1 sand unit the
Cock且eld comprises "interbedded
days, silts , and muds" (1 %0 , p. 92)
and is "predominant1y composed of
very fine sand and si1t" (1993 , p. 87) ,
with scattered occurrenc臼 ofpe时，
直ed wood, leaf fossils , lignite, and
glauconite (Andersen 1960). These
chatacteristics suggest that the
Cockfìeld represents deltaic depositìon on a sha110w shel f. 1ts thickness
penetrated by a well in Sec. 抖， T7N，
R6W (1 5.2 kr丑 or 9.5 mi northeast
of the study area) is listed by
Andersen (1993) as 630 丘 (192 m).
Among the electric logs examined for
this investigation , the Cockfìeld
shows a thickness range of 740 to
1 ，090 丘 (226 to 332 m) and shows
individu a1 sand interva1s as thick as
150 丘 (46 m).
Jackson Group (Undifferentiated)
According to Andersen (1 %0) ,
the Jackson Group comprises primarily day with varying admixtures of
sand, glauconite, and volcanidastic
materi a1, is fossiliferous in its lower
portìons (Moodys Branch and Yazoo
formations and Danvil1e Landing
beds) , and has a tota1 thickness of 600
丘 (180 m) near 出e Sabine伊民rnon
Parish line. Like 由eCock且 eld， the
Jackson outcrop is 1imited to a sma11

area in the northwestern portion of
the study area. Though it is not
particulatly well exposed, we were
able to observe it at more localities
出an we were the Cockfìeld. Stil1, our
observations were ÌnsufficÌent to
improve on the mapping of An dersen
(1 960 , 1993) , and as a result w巳
follow his mapping of the unit very
dosely and thus a1so his definition of
it. An dersen (1993) mentions the
over a11 sωcity of Jackson Group
exposures in Natchitoches Patish;
a1 though apparent1y it is not much
better exposed in Sabine Patish,
Andersen (1 960) found exposures
adequate to describe its constituent
formations there and was also able to
use 由is subdivision later in his
description of the unit in
Natchitoches Patish. 1n Sabine Parish,
Andersen (1960) mentions several
specific outcrops , all but one of which
are west of the present study area; in
Natcrutoches Parish, he specifically
mentions three outcrops , plus
somewhat fragmentary data 丘omtwo
wells, all of which are nor出 ofthe
study area (Andersen 1993).
We were able to examine exposures of the Jackson at approximately
15 localities , most of which lie in the
Peason quadrangle [N C]; a11 the
following references a陀 to localities
from this area. At these sites the
Jackson Group is represented principally by grayish silty and sandy day,
and dayey very fine sand, with
reddish mott1 es. Where observed in
NW/SE Sec. 19 , T6N, R9W, the
Jackson ís a silty cla.严 líght brownish
gray 2.5Y 612 atid gray 5Y 5/1 , with
red 7.5R 4/6 mott1es. Petrified wood
fragments were observed in float at
two lo ca1 ities , in SE/SW Sec. 13 and
SE Sec. 17， τ6t~， F. .9宫r. At another
locality in SE/NE Sec. 19 , T6N ,
R9 W, we were able to observe cobbleand boulder-sized carbonate nodules
up to 20 cm x 30 cm in the Jackson,
indicatìng this to be an exposure of
出e Moodys Branch Formation. These
nodules ate approximately light

greenish gray 10Y 8/1 [not their exact
color, but the closest to a match with
a Munsell color] , and 出ey occur in
grayish green , c1ayey ve可 fine to fine
sand. The overa11 fine-grained
character of the Jackson and the
reported presence of glauconite ate
suggestive of deposition on a sh a11ow,
muddy shelf.
Oligocene Series
Vicksburg Group
(Undifferentiated)

Andersen (1 960 , 1993) provided
the stratigraphic framework for the
Vicksburg Group in the study 红ea;
he described two members of formation rank in Sabíne 阳ish-the
Sandel and Nash Creek formations
plus a third in Natchitoches Patish,
the overlying Rosefield FormatÏon.
The lowermost formation , the Sandel,
comprises sand with interbedded
conglomerate containing cobbles and
slabs of carbonaceous bentonitic clay
like that of the overlying Nash Creek.
Based on the investigation ofRul臼5
and Gooch (1939) , Andersen (1 993)
portrayed the Rosefield as comprising
lentils of marly clay that form a
marine tongue extending into
Natchitoches Patish from the east,
and which pinches out westward
approximately 13 km (8 mi) east of
the present study area; it follows that
the Vicksburg in the Fort Polk region
consists of the same two formations
that An dersen (1 960) described in
Sabine Parish. Because of sparse
exposur臼 and the narrown臼s of 由e
Vicksburg outcrop belt, Andersen
(1960 , 1993) did not di坠rentìate its
constituent formatÏons on his maps;
as with the Cockfield Formation and
Jackson Group, our maps follow
closely his rendering of the
Vicksburg. On electric logs the
Jackson and Vicksburg Groups appear
as a combined interval of fine回grained
sediment, which among the logs
examined for this investigation ranges

from 640 to 1 ， 040 丘 (195 to 317 m).
We were able to observe
Vicksburg sediment at approximately
15 locaÎi ties. Sandier sediment Îs
typically a gr可ish， clayey very fìne
sand, with red mottles in places.
Muddier sediment is typically a dark
gray to dark reddish brown to
chocolate brown , thinly laminated
silty clay. Where examined at one
locality in SE Sec. 19 , T6N, R8W
(Kisatchie quadrangle [N\XI币，由e
laminae sep红ate readily, giving 出e
sediment a flalry- aspect in hand
specimen. Munsell colors determined

Vicksburg range 丘om light brownish
gray 10YR 6/2 for silty clay in NW/
NE Sec. 26, T6N, R8W (Kisatchie
quadrangle [NE]) to 1ight brown
7 .5YR 6/3 and reddish brown 当YR5/
3 for clay in SW/NW Sec. 32 , T6N ,
R9W (Peason quadrangle [NC]).
Petrifìed wood was found in float at
three localities (two in Peason quadrangle [N町，四d one in Ki satchie
q uadrangle [N町)， comprising two
exposures of grayish , clayey veηT fllle
sand (NW Sec. 27, T剧， R9W， SW
Sec. 14, T6N, R8W) and one exposure of dark reddish brown mud (SE
Sec. 22-NE Sec. 27 , T6N, R9W).
Catahoula For皿ation
Rogers and Calandro (1 965) gave
a thickness range of 200 to 500 丘 (61
to 152 m) for the Catahoula near the
outcrop in Vernon Parish and 600 to
1,000 ft (1 83 to 305 m) in the
subsurface near the southern parish
line. Hinds (1 998a, 1999 , P1ates 3 , 4)
shows Catahoula intercepts indicating
a thickness of approximately 475 ft
(145 m) for well V-505 in T2N ,
R9W. On electric logs examined for
this investigation , the Cat~~oula
ranges from 225 to 865 丘 (69 to 264
m) , with individual sandy intervals
ranging up to 180 丘(男 m).
The Catahoula in the study area
is relatively well exposed and could be
examined at numerous localities. The

formation comprises sediments 由at
are textur过ly quite heterogeneous and
which tend to be poorly sorted.τhe
1ithologies that occ盯 Wl出 the
greatest 仕equency where we observed
it are in the range of silt/siltstone to
very fine quartzose sand/sandstone ,
with or without admixtures of clay.
Even where coarser grains of medium
sand to granule sizes are p纪sent， the
overaU or predomînant gr幻n sîze of
sand/sandstone at a majority of
localities tends to average ve可自ne to
fìne sand. Coarser grains may comprise quartz, chert, and/or mud clasts;
darker grains , observed in some
places , appear in hand specimen to
predominantly consist of chert.
Colors tend mostly toward 1ighter
hues with substantial amounts of
gray, Wl出 red mottles showing in silty
and sandy clay and clayey sand in
places. Silt and siltstone, with or
without admixtures of clay, show a
tendency toward a greenish cast. Sand
may be loose, semiconsolidated, well
consolidated, or orthoquartzitic;
better conso1idated examples , which
include occurrenc口 with opa1ine
cement in plac白， tend toward more
nearly whitish hues. Catahoula
sediments weather local片 in places (as
in Peason quadrangle [SW], where
the parent material consists primarily
of silty clay, clayey silt/siltstone，扭d
clayey very fine to fìne sand) to
produce a thick (up to 2 m) gray/tan
loamy surface unit.
Internal f七atures most commonly
obse凹ed are cross bedding in sand/
sandstone，由in beds in vely 盘时
sand/sandstone, and la.ï lÏnations in
silt/siltstone, although apparently
massive examples of these textural
types are also common. Other
features include 出εlightish mud ripup clasts mentioned above , and
petrifìed wood, wood impressions ,
and root casts. Ophíomoψha nodosa
burrows, with characteristic "corncob" texture on 出e outer surface of
outer whitish mud "skins," were
observed in salmon-red-weathering

cross-bedded sand at one locality in
Peason quadr皿gle [NE].
1βC在1 diagenetic e岳cts observed,
aside from silicifìcation and
opalization, comprise iron-oxide
concentration, ranging from orangish
weathering stains through brownish
orange liesegang-type bands to
ironstone concretions up to 2 cm
across. Silicifìed, orthoquartzitic rock
is mined 丘om the Catahoula by
Apeck Construction Company at the
Ellzey quar可 in SE/SE Sec. 15 and
SW/SW Sec. 14, T5N, R10W,
Peason quadrangle [SW], in southeastern Sabine Parish.
Munsell colors were noted for
Catahoulasediments at numerous
localities省 These and colors of
Fleming sediments are listed in
Appendix A by portions of quad四
rangles , approximately 丘om
southwest to northeast along 由e
outcrop belt.
The characterístics of the
Catahoula observed in the study 红'ea
accord for the most p红twi由 its
traditional interpretation as reflective
of continental , fluvial-dominated
deposition. The Ophíomoψha nodosa
burrows are the single exception;
句b切morpha is genera11y considered a
rel iable indicator of deposition in a
shallow marine , nearshore setting, but
according to Frey and Howard (1 970)
"has been ,J ound . . . in brackish to
fresh water deposits" and "do[es] not
have unequivocal signifìcance" (p.
155). Thelarge proportion of silt
observed in Catahoula textm臼 is， in
any case, consistent wi也 deposition
near the transition to a coastal floodbasin setting with onset of influence
by deltaic deposition. In his investigation of the geology of Rapides and
Ávoyelles parishes , Fisk (1 940 , his
plate 6) interpreted the transition
from continental to brackish-water
facies in the Catahoula to lie in the
shallow subsurface approximately at
出e position of the parish boundary

separating southern Natchitoches and
northwestern R且pides parishes.
Miocene Seíies
Fleming Group
The memhers of the Fleming
defìned hy Fisk (1 940) in Rapides
Parish and mapped hy Welch (1942)
in Vernon Parish comprise coarsergrained lithofacies interpreted as
自uvial-dominated， alternating with
fìner-grained , more m缸ine-influ­
enced lithofacies. Fisk (1940)
interpreted the coarser-grained
memhers as fluvial and the fìnergrained members as estuarine. Hinds
(1 998a, 1999) elahorated hoth on
Fisk's (1940) surface- and near-surf二ce
characterization of depositional
settings and on Rainwater's (1964)
deeper-suhsurface depositional
丘amework for the Louisiana Miocene, and attempted to integrate
these and his own ohservations with
the genetic stratigraphic 丘amework
developed hy Galloway (1 989a, h)
and Galloway and others (1 991) for
the northern Gulf Coast. Hinds made
the refìnement of interpreting
Fleming memhers as repr臼enting
upper and lower delta-plain deposition , and the latter, corresponding to
the fìner四grained members , as potentially the updip expression of
suhsurface marine shale tongues and
associated flooding surfaces corresponding to periods of maximum
transgression during the Miocene. He
correlated the Dough Hills wi出 the
_Marginulina ascensíonensis tongue of
the subsurface , the Castor Creek with
the Amphistegína fauna tongue , and
the Blounts Creek with the léxtularia
stapperi 皿d Bigenerina卢'oridana

tongues (Hinds 1998a, 1999 , his
fìgures 31 and 34). The hypothesized
downdip marine shale of the Lena
Memher on his fìgure 34 corresponds
in position to the m斗 or Síphonina
davisi tongue (Rainwater 1964).
According to Ye and others (1995) ,
the nature of depositional sequence

cycles in the Miocene of the northern
Gulf Coast indicates that
glacioeustatic control of cyclicity was
operatíve, and the Síphonina 均visi，

Marginulina ascensionensí.马皿d
Amphistegina fauna tongues correspond to the three m习 or
transgressions in the northern G吐f
Coast Miocene.
The gross textures ohserved for
也e sandier Fleming suhunits in the
study area suggest that the Fleming
interval reflects increasing regression
followed hy marine encroachment:

1 is textural片
the Carnaha
similar to the Catahoula, encompassing a wide range of textures hut with
mean grain size in 出巳 silt to fìne sand
range; the Williamson Creek has the
largest proportion of coarse textures,
which comprise mostly ve叮 co红se
sand and granules; and the Blounts
Creek comprises mostly fìne and very
fìne sand, silt, and mud. This sequence accords with Hinds's (1 998a)
account of the environments of
deposition (see his fìgure 28) , in
which the Lena and Dough H il1 s
memhers show "a lesser degree of
hrackish-water in丑uencethan 出at
seen in the Castor Creek Memher" (p.
63) , the W il1 iamson Creek is "the
terrestrially influenced end memher
of the Fleming Formation depositional model," and "[t]he basal
section of the Castor Creek Memher
forms the hrackish-water-influenced
end memher of the Fleming depositional model" (p. 68). It is also
consistent with the ohservation hy Ye
and others (1 995) that parasequenceset cycles in the upper 岛1iocene
sequence cycles of southwestern
Louisiana comprise mostly interýals
of highstand (HST) and transgressive
(TST) systems tracts.
The vertehrate fossils discovered
recentlyat Fort Pol1王 occur in one of
these overall fìner-grained suhunits,
the Castor Creek, hut within a
notahly coarser-grained suhinterval
consisting of conglomerate and
sandstone. The conglomerate consists

of carbonate nodules reworked from
the su问 acent mudstone, which is
typical of the Castor Creek elsewhere
in Vernon Parish , and 也e conglomera旬-and-sandstone subintervallies on
this mudstone with an erosive base
(Hinds 1998a, 1999 , his fìgure 11).
Jones and others (1 995) showed that
at least this portion of the Castor
Creek sequence can he interpreted as
fluviatile; however, this suhinterval
constitutes a relatively small portion
of the total Castor Creek interval,
and as suggested hy Hinds (1 998a,
1999) is unrepresentative of the
interval as a whole. Another of the
fìner-grained subunits , the Dough
Hills , shows an increased frequency
of coarse- to granule-sized quartzose
material over its entire interval near
its eastern extent in the study area,
which Hinds (1 998a, 1999) inferred
corresponds to a persistent fluvial axis
in 出at position.

units. 1n this report we have therefore
followed the sugg臼tion ofRogers
(personal communication 1999) and
designated the Fleming as a group
and its constituent suhdivisions as
formations. Because the Fleming
suhdivisions constitute lithofacies
recognizahle principally hy gross
lithology and position in the se四
quence, these un Ïts should only be
mappahle within a transitional
paleogeographic belt centered around
the position of the Miocene coastal
plain疆An examination of selected
suhsurface welllogs in southern
飞仨rnon and northern Beauregard
parishes , and in areas along strike as
far east as West Feliciana Parish across
出e Mississippi River flood plain ,
showed the downdip position at
which correlation of Fleming suhunits
becomes notahly more diffìcult and
complicated owing to a thickened

total sequence with overall more
stratigraphically defined units , she
uniform log character and only fineused a slice-mapping technique to
scale irregular variation. This position
divide the total Fleming-Willis
should mark the farthest downdip
interval into a consistent number of
extent of continental fluvial facies
arbitrary subunits having equal
into the coastal flood-basin setting in
thickness at any given locality. The
出e Fleming, and it is rendered in
Louisiana portion of her mapping
figure 12 (sawtooth line) as a transishou1d depict such lithofacies trends
tion between fluvial and mixed
primarily for the Fleming, because of
fluvial-deltaic facies. In his investigathe relatively small proportion of the
tion in Rapides and Avoyelles
total interval accounted for by the
parishes, Fisk (1940 , his plate 6)
W i1l is. Despite a large area of no data
placed this facies boundary in the
on Jones's maps , corresponding to
shallow subsurface nearly as far south
almost the entire northeastern half of
出 the parish line sep红ating southVernon Parish and including nearly

the electric logs examined for 出lS
investigation, the Le na shows a
由ickn口s range of 90 to 320 丘 (27 to
98 m); the thinner values are from
wells drilled near the outcrop in
southern Sabine and Natchitoches
parishes.
The Lena Formation shows
constituent lithologies essentially like
those observed in the underlying
Catahoula, the difference being
primarily in the increased proportion
of the fìner-grained textures. Am ong
the surface exposures of the Lena we
were able to examine are 16 occurrences of day, with and without
admixed sand and silt; 20 occurrences
of siltlsiltstone, mostly without
substantial admixed day; and 26
occurrences of sandlsandstone , with
and without admixed clay. In some
areas, such as in parts of the Peason
quadrangle [EC] and the Ki satchie
quadrangle [C], the Lena weathers to
produce a brownish gray to lightish
surf主ce sand. Though it is relatively
well exposed, the lack of a clear

lithologic distinction , the relative
thinness of the interval, and the
consequent narrowness of its outcrop
belt are such that delineating the Lena
from fìeld observations becomes a
largely statistical exercise. This is also
underscored by 出e lack of a distinct
soils signature (Guillorγ1997; Martin
et al. 1990) and ofknown characteristic plant communities specifìc to 由E
Lena (Smith , personal communication 1994). For the above reasons ,
our mapping largely fo l1 ows that of
Rogers (1980). The lithologic similari可 of the underlying upper portion of
出e Catahoula Formation with the
overlying Carnahan Bayou Formation
was noted by An dersen (1960 , p.
11 0) , and in eastern Texas the Lena
扭d Carnahan Bayou are in fact
classi自ed as the uppermost portion of
the Catahoula (American As sociation
ofPetroleum Geologists 1988).
Lena sediments show overall
coloration similar to that of equivalent Catahoula lithologies, tenrung
toward grayish, greenish, and brownish hues among fmer-grained textures
and toward more nearly whitish
hues in sandstones lacking
substantial admixed clay.
Sand and sandstone may
also , rarel实 weather to
reddish hues and resemble
Plio四Pleistocene strata.
Grayish silt and siltstone
tend to have a greenish
cast but common甘
weather to nearly whitish

hues. Grayish and greenish gray silty
clay, clayey silt, sandy clay, and clayey
sand show red and/or yellow motrles
where observed in a few places. Sand
and sandstone average ve可 fìne to
fme but show the same overall poor
sorting as noted for Catahoula
sediments, and in places contain
coarse sand and granules. Few
structures were observed in sandl
sandstone except for rare laminations.
Notable differences from the
Catahoula include discernibly plastic
clay observed at two localities, and
calcareous clay (with calcareous
nodules) also from two localities.
Carnahan Bayou Formation

The Carnahan Bayou Formation
of the Fleming Group has the widest
outcrop belt, is perhaps the best
exposed of any of the map units in
the study area, and could be obse凹ed
at hundreds of exposures. Rogers and
Calandro (1965) indicated a 出ick庐
ness range of approximately 500 to
1 ， 100 丘(1 52 to 335 m) for the
Carnahan Bayou in Vernon Parish,
making it and the Blounts Creek the
thickest Fleming subunÍts. Hinds
(l 998a, 1999) estimated the thiclmess
range of the Carnahan Bayou in the
Fort Polk area as 500 to 550 丘(1 52
to 168 m); his Plates 3 and 4 show
subsurface intercepts in water wells ,
indicating a thickness range of
approximately 475 to 550 丘 (145 to
168 m). 联lllogs examined for this

higher mobility of silica relative to

observed in the Catahoula. This is
shown by the formation of sandstone

silica cementation, occurrence of silcrete layers and veins , and siliceous root trac臼/
nodules in sand and sandstone. Lo calized cementation by common opal was
observed in the Peason quadrangle [SC] , in NW Sec. 21 , T5N, R9W. Loca1ized

The joints are nonvegetated but occur as part of a single predominant set 由at
includes preferentia11y vegetated joints that form microlineaments. The joint set
strikes between approximately 75 0 and 85 0 , but good-quality examples at this
loc a1 ity were not considered numerous enough to take multiple strike readings.
The widespread occurrence of the above silicification features may reflect the
greater weathering inferred from the more varied coloration observed in the
Carnahan Bayou.

western Slagle quadrangle. Within
this area it is relatively well exposed
and comprises varying proportions of
clay, sand and sandstone , and síÎ t and
siltstone. Clay is fairly uniformly of
grayish coloration, is sílty and sandy
in many places , and includes calcareous clay一-containing characteristic
calcareous nodules-observed at
several exposures. Sand and sandstone
are poorly sorted, range in grain size
from very fine to ve可 coarse but
average very 自ne to fine , are clayey in
many places , and contain sparse
quartz gran吐es at a number of
localities. They are predominantly
grayish, with a greenish cast in some
places (mostly for the very fine size
t云action) ， and sand shows reddish and
yellowish mottles in places. At a
number of localities , sand is colored
reddish where coarser-grained (overall
自ne to medium or ∞arser) ， and
reddish sand was observed with
yellow mottles at one locality; sand is
colored any combinatÎon of grayish ,
reddish , and yellowish where coarsergrained at a fe'i甲 localitÎes. Silt and
siltstone are colored grayish with a
tendency toward a greenish cast; both
reddish and grayish silt were observed
at one locality in association with
reddish very fine to very coarse sand
with gran吐白画
The following internal features
were observed in sediments of the
Dough Hills at only a few localities:
laminations in sand and sandstone,
lightish clay/mud rip-up dasts
(generally pebbles , but including
some granules) , and siliceous nodules
in grayish day and grayish-greenish
laminated sand.
The eastern edge of the southern
Kurthwood quadrangle [EC , 5町， east
ofthe Calιasieu River，正ontaÎns a
relatively higher proportion of grayish
day and sand and red-weathering
sand containing quartz granules, in
the Dough Hills outcrop belt. Hinds
(1998a, 1999) suggested that the
larger average grain sizes along with

the decrease in frequency of calcareous day in this area could reflect a
coarse-g血 ned subfacies of the Dough
Hílls corresponding to a fluvial axis.
Such a subfacies might correspond to
出e surface outcrop of the sand up to
90 丘 (27 m) thick seen near the ne缸
the middle of the Dough Hills
interval on welllogs.
As mentioned above, the day of
the Dough Hills indudes calcareous
day, which contains calcareous
nodules in places. It appears that an
anomalous localized concentration of
fme-grained calcareous rock is being
quarried 丘om the Dough Hills in the
Leesvílle quadrangle [N C] west of the
southern portion of the study area.
W也 were unable to gain access to the
site of the quar巧; but it appears to be
located in an area 1 km (0.6 mi) eastsoutheast of the northeastern arm of
Vernon Lake and 0.3 to 0 .4 km (0.5
to 0.6 mi) east ofHwy. 171 , along
the boundary between the western
halves of Secs. 20 and 29 , T3N ,
R9W. An informant indicated that
the material , locally known as
"soapstone," is mined by Apeck
ConstructÎ on for Boise Cascade on
Boise prope坷; and 由at it holds up
well as a durable road metal and is
used principally to repair "bad spots"
in roads. Our inference 出at the
material quarried is calcareous rock is
based on specimens examined in a
roadcut on the east side ofHwy. 171
directly north of the road leading t。
由e site. In hand specimen it is
essentially white, possibly with a
slighrly greenish cast, and has a challcy
appear扭ce overall. Examination in
thin section shows it to consist of
aphanocrystalline calcium carbonate.
Ezat Heydari (personal communication 1998) indicated that it is a lime
mud of asort 由at could possibly be
of either marine or lacustrine origin.

Williamson Creek Formation
Rogers and Calandro (196步)
indicated a thidmess range of 400 to
900 丘(1 22 to 274 m) for the

Williamson Creek in Vernon Parish.
Hinds (1 998a, 1999) estimated irs
thidmess range as 400 to 600 丘(1 22
to 183 m) in the Fort Polk area, and
his Plat臼 3 and 4 show subsurface
intercepts in water wells indicating
thicknesses ranging from approximately 350 to 500 ft (1 07 to 152 m)
for the formation. Welllogs examined
for this investigation show the
Wílliamson Creek ranging from 340
to 810 丘(1 04 to 247 m) thick; 四
exception, as noted above, is the U.S.
Geological Survey's well V-234 in Sec.
1, T2S , Rll W, f红 to the southwest of
the study area, in which the
Wílliamson Creek thickens to 1,075
丘 (328 m) in conjunction with
thinning of the underlying Dough
H ilI s Formation. lndividual sandy
intervals in the W ilIiamson Creek
seen on welllogs range up to 135 丘
(41 m) thick.
Most of the W ilIiamson Creek
outcrop belt within the study area is
in the Slagle quadrangle, essentially
all of which was mapped by Hinds
(1 998a, c; 1999). W七 obse凹ed it
almost exdusively in exposures in the
northern Simpson South and Lacamp
quadrangles, where the outcrop belt
flanks the Calcasieu River flood plain
on both sides. The W ilIiamson Creek
shows the same poor sorting characteristic of other portions of the
Fleming sequence, and its 且nergrained sediment, consisting of
grayish clayey silt to ve可自ne sand
Wl出 some reddish mottles in places ,
resembles that common in other p红ts
of the Fleming. But the overall grain
size appears co缸ser than in other
Fleming subunits, with sands containing much more of the coarser size
frac tÎons and a larger proportion of
quartz granules in plac白·
Sand is 出e most common
lithology observed in the Williamson

subunits of the Fleming. Granules are
extremely abundant locally 皿d
consist almost exdusively of quartz.
The best example of such coarsergrained, granule-rich sediment we
obse凹ed in the Williamson Creel王 lS a
large roadcut expos山e south-southeast of Simpson, in the Lacamp
quadrangle [NW]; it consists of
reddish quartwse co缸se to very
coarse sand with abundant granules
and some small pebbles, and in part
(principally along specific cross bed
sets) comprises sandy granule conglomerate. Rare small pebbles
observed elsewhere in the Williamson
Creek, as at this locality, consist
primarily of quartz and comprise the
largest size 台action in quartzose
granuliferous sediment. Lightish dayl
mud rip-up dasts were seen at a single
locality. Colors comprise primarily
grayish hues in finer-grained sediment
and reddish hues in coarser-grained
sediment, apparently reflecting
greater weathering of the coarser
portions; 出e coarser sediment also
indudes some with yellowishl
brownish and roseate hues in places.
Rare beds of indurated sandstone
weather to whitish hues as in the
Catahoula and Carnahan Bayou, and
the more reddish examples of the
coarser-grained sands show notable
colluviation in many places. Silt
observed in the Williamson Creek is
generally dayey and grayish, with
some reddish and yellowish-brownish
mottles in places; day is generally
grayish and silty, and is rarely
mott1ed.

Castor Creek Formation

Rogers and Calandro (1965)
indicated approximately 300+ 丘 (91+
m) as representative of the thickness
of the Castor Creek in Vernon Parish.
Hinds (1998a, 1999) estimated 450
to 500 丘(1 37 to 152 m) as the
thickness range of the Castor Creek
in the Fort Polk area, and his Plat臼 3
扭d 4 show subsurface intercepts in
water wells, indicating thicknesses of
approximately 270 to 550 丘 (82 to
168 m). Among the welllogs examined for this investigation, the Castor
Creek ranges from 250 to 500 丘(7 6
to 152 m) thick and can contain
individual sandy intervals of up to 45
丘 (14 m) thick.
For this investigation the Castor
Creek Formation of the Fleming
Group was observed mos t1y in the
area south of the Calcasieu River
自ood plain in the Simpson South and
Lacamp quadrangles; the remainder
of its outcrop belt within the study
area courses through the Fort Polk
and Slagle quadrangles and was
mapped by Hinds (1 998a, b; 1999) ,
whose Fleming contacts are incorporated in our maps. Where observed in
surf主.ce exposutes the Castor Creek
consists primarily of day that is silty
to ve可 fine sandy and of grayish
color, and which shows reddish

mottles in places. Calcareous day,
wi出 irregular calcareous nodules up
to several cm long, was observed at
n田nerous localities in the Castor
Creek, and except for the contained
calcareous nodules it is otherwise
similar in appearan∞ to dayofthe
overlying Blounts Creek Formation.
The next most common lithology is
very fine to fine sand, also generally
grayish and showing reddish mott1es
in places; it is generally dayey but is
silty in a few places. Petri直ed wood
was found in float at two localities in
the Castor Creek where dayey sand
was exposed, in SW Sec. 6 and NW
Sec. 7 , T2N，盯W， Lacamp quadrangle [C]. Rare silt, where it occurs ,
is grayish and clayey. Sand weathers
locally to colors ranging from yellowish brown to brownish red, and the
Castor Creek in some areas weathers
to produce surficial mant1es of red
and yellow loam , the red loam
attaining substantial thickness (up to
2 m) in plac臼. Munsell color determinations for Castor Creek sediment
are 1isted in Appendix A.
In the southeastern portion of the
Simpson South quadrangle , in Slagle
areas 8 , 9 , and 10, the unconformable
contact between grayish and greenish
gray silty clay of the Castor Creek and
reddish sandy sediment of the
overlying Upland Allogroup, Willis
Formation , is exposed and shows the
characteristic alteration seen between
出e Miocen巳 and P 1io-Pleistocene
elsewhere in the study area. Along the

Brushy Creek in Slagle area 10, in NE

Jones and others (1 995) showed that
at least this portion of the Castor
Creek sequence exposed in this area
can be interpreted as showing more of
a fluvi过 influence 出an previously
thought, and episodes of repetitive
p a1eosol formation on a flood plain
surface can be inferred 丘om detailed
descriptions and an a1yses of severa1
50-foot (1 5-m) cores. Hinds (1998a,
1999) pointed out, and we concu巳
that this portion of 出e interv址，
characterized as it is by concentration
of reworked ca1careous nodules into
conglomerate beds, is probably not
representative of the Castor Creek
interva1 overa11; rather, it appears to
reflect incision of the more characteris tÎc sequence such as would occur in
conjunction with a drop in base leve1.
Hinds (1998a, 1999) suggested that
such a drop in relative sea level could
have accompanied increased
progradation associated with the
eastward shifting of depocenters
documented across the northern Gulf
ofMexico (Wil1iamson 1959;
Woodbury et a1. 1973; G a110wayet
a1. 1991). This depocenter shift
accompanied renewed upli丘。fthe
southern Rocky Mountains beginning
in the early Miocene (Winker 1982)
and reached southwestern Louisiana
in the early Miocene and southeastern
Louisiana in the late Miocene.
Unfortunately, the dril1ing of the
above cores did not permit determination of the position of the
conglome1'ate beds rela由e to the top
and base of the Castor Creek. An

area as sca1'cely greate1' than 300 丘 (91

downdip in o1'de1' to dete1'mine the
stratigraphic position of the Discove1'y landfill site 1'elative to the top of
the fo 1'mation; the section shows that
the site essentially represents the
outcropping of the uppermost
portion of the unit.
Schiebout (1 997) and he1'
collabo1'ato1's applied a variety of
techniques , e.g吁 pa1eomagnetism，
p a1ynology, and stable isotopes , to
determine 也e age of thei 1' cores. For
this investigation we inquired into
possible addition a1 techniques that
might be used to date the co1'es. The
main promise appeared to be held by
uranium-lead dating techniques (e.g. ,
Ras bury et al. 1997) , which we
expected to be applicable to the
dating of pedogenic carbonate
nodules 1'ecove1'ed in the co1'es. The
carbonate nodules, howeve1', were
1'eve a1 ed to be far too young for
dating by such techniques (Rasbuη}
persona1 communication 1997).
The North American land mammal 唔e of the Fort Polk verteb1'ate
fauna is estimated as early late
Barstovian (Schiebout 1994, 1997;
Schiebout et al. 1996), corresponding
to a late Midd1e Miocene age (Hin也

Ful1erton Lake q田.drangles，皿d it sligl昨
overlaps the southern Simpson South and
Lacamp quadr丑ngl臼. Hinds (1998a, b;
1999) mapped most of the Fort Polk
quadrangle and a small portion of the
Simpson Sou也 quadrangle; our obs盯a­
tÏons of the Blounts Cree1c were made
principal与T in the Birds Creek and
Ful1erton lake q阳山angles.
The Blounts Creek can be
described as a relatively nondescript
series of grayish dayey and silty very
fìne to fìne sands , si1ty and very fìne
to fìne sandy days , and dayey silts. It
is the 直ne时血ned of the sandy
Fleming subunits, because it generally
lacks grains coarser 出皿 its mean
grain size. The coarsest texture we
noted in the Blounts Creelζwas
medium sand. Whereas sands of the

Carnahan Bayou and Williamson
Creek also have a very fine to fine or
直ne to meruum mean grain size in
many places, they typically contain
additional coarser grains in varying
propor tÏ ons. Thus, although sands of
the Blounts Cree1王 are not well sorted,
they are relatively better sorted than
those of the Carnahan Bayou and
W i1liamson Creek, with a finer
overalì texture. A1rhough rare reddish
motdes were observed in Bl ounts
Creek seruments, such mottling,
along with weathering to reddish hues
overall, is less common than for
sediments of the Carnahan Bayou
皿d the Williamson Creek formations, possibly as a function of this
overall fmer grain size. Surface sands
colored in yellowish, orangish，四d
roseate hues, induding some containing gr皿吐es in places , were seen in

Store

places in the Blounts Creek outcrop
belt, but all such localities are ne缸
contacts with reddish sandy sediments of the ovedying Willis
Formation and are inferred to
represent surface wash deriving from
that unit.

As suggested above, our observations of Blounts Creek sediment
within the study area revealed few
dis tÏ nctive features of the unit. Aside
from the measured sectÏon localíty
fìgured below, the only sedimentary
structures we noted were rare laminations and cross beds. An exposure of
the Blounts Creek examined southwest of the railroad crossing at
Pickeríng, w<臼t of the sourhwestern
portion of the study 红eain the New
Llano quadrangle [SE] , constitutes
the best example of structures seen in
the unit; this locality was fìgured by

Welch (1 942 , pp. 60-61 , his figures
10 and 11 一-the latter redrafted
herein as figure 16). Abundant and
well preserved 自ne-scaÌe stratÏ ficatíon
and low-angle cross stratÏ fication are
traceable across much of the exposure,
and the dayey to very fine sandy
sediment exposed there also contaíns
whitish fossil wood.
Diagenetíc features observed in
the Blounts Creek comprise only rare
ironstone concretÍons 血d incipient
and spotty silica cementatÏon. In the
rare places where the sands are

Upland All ogroup

Although its outcrop is highly
dissected and discontinuous, the
Upland Allogroup , which is equiva四
lent to the "High Terraces" of earlier
usage, is one of the more widespread
and recognizable stratigraphic units
within the Coastal Plain Province.
The deposits of the Upland
All ogroup occur as remnants of a
once regionally extensive blanket of
coarse-grained sediments, which are
recognizable along the Coastal Plain
Province from Virginia to Texas. The
deposits of the Upland A110group
commonly occur as erosional remnants capping isolated hilltops and
comprising the ridge crests of interfluves (Autin et al. 1991).
The sediments that comprise the
Upland Allogroup differ from the
underlying Miocene strata 扭d 由e
deposits of the 1ntermediate
Allogroup, which onlap
unconformably onto it. First, the
sediments of the Upland Allogroup
are gener a1ly coarser than the Miocene strata underlying it 扭d the
younger sediments of the 1ntermediate All ogmup that onlap onto it.
Generally, but not always , the co红ser
nature of the Upland Allogroup is
manÌ岳st Ìn the presence of an
abundance of gravel throughout its
thickness (Matson 1916; Doering
1935, 1956; Forney 19步。; Autin et
al. 1991). Second, in contrast to
younger and older strata, sediments
within the Upland Allogroup are
characteristically ve可 highly weathered. As a result they exhibit deep
reddish , browni品，且d purplish
colors of ferric iron oxides not seen in
the strata lying stratigr叩hically above
and below it (Doering 1956; Aronow
1982; Autin et al. 1991). Third，由e
Upland Allogroup erodes into
resistant hills, creating well de自ned
cuestas and sharp ridges 由at contrast

with the relatively dissected but flat
terrace surfaces associated with
sediments composing the 1ntermediate Allogroup. 日naU严 the soils ,
princip a1ly u1tisols and some alfìsols,
developed in the sediments of the
Upland Allogroup are 巧Tp ica1ly far
more mature than 出ose developed in
either the Fleming Group or the
1ntermediate A110group (Forney
1950; Autin et al. 1991; Dubar et al.
1991).
The mapping of the Upland
Allogroup conducted for this investigation res u1ted in a distribution that
di能rs notably in places from that
interpreted by previous investigators.
1n a general sense, Hinds (1 998a-c,
1999) was compelled to interpret
substantially more Upland A110group
sediment area1ly 由an had been earlier
depicted by Welch (1942); and our
mapping, though essentially in accord
with that ofHinds (1998a-c, 1999)
where our two study areas overlap
(fìgure 码， generally depicts slighcly
less Upland All ogroup sediment
areal非出皿 his. The main area of
di佐rence in this regard relative to
previous work is in the northwestern
portion of the study area, in southeastern Sabine Parish and the adjacent
portion of northwestern Vernon
Parish-in southeastern Peason
quadrangle and the adjacent northeastern portion of the Dowden Creek
quadrangle. An dersen (1 960) mapped
extensive areas of "Plio回Pleistocene
(Undifferentiated)" on "Miocene
(Undifferentiated)" in
southeasternmost Sabine Parish,
across from less-extensive but comparable mapping of "Williana
formation" by Welch (1942) in the
adjacent portion ofVernon Parish.
Onc large P1io-Plcistoccnc polygon
mapped by Andersen (1 960) in the
Peason quadrangle [NC, C] was
confìrmed in this investigation ,
whereas another in the Peason
quadrangle [SC , SE] was eliminated
entirely except for scattered, minute
outliers ，也e highest being 由at

capping Eagle Hill. An dersen (1 960)
explained that in southeastern Sabine
Parish , "[w]hen the stratigraphic
position was not evîdent sand units at
elevations of 400 企et (approx.) were
mapped as Plio-Pleistocene" (p. 110) ,
and went on to express concern about
the consequences of this procedure
for the geologic mapping in that area.
1n the area of the eliminated polygon ,
aside from the small out1iers retained,
we observed in places some weathering e坠cts that produce coloration
more typical1y characreristic of PlioPleistocene than of Miocene
sediment, but found them both
limited at the outcrop scale and
areally sparse. Thus, for us 出E
straightforward interpretation w臼 of
surfÌcial weathering of Carnahan
Bayou sediment.
Willis Fonnation
Traditionally, the deposits of the
Upland A110group-which has also
been designated as either the "High
I祉race" or "Upland Complex飞一
have been correlated with the
W il1iana formation ofFisk (1 938 ,
1940). For example, Bernard (1 950)
c1assifìed strata equivalent to the
Upland Allogroup in southeast Texas
as belonging to the Williana Formation of Fisk (1 938, 1940). Similarl严
both Welch (1 942) and Hinds
(1 998a, 1999) argued that the Willis
and Williana Formations are equivalent stratigraphic units and thus
c1assifìed the strata within 出巳 Fort
Polk region as belonging to the
Williana Formation.
However, a care缸l1y constructed
regional cross section (see 自gures 20
and 21) confìrms an observation by
Doering (1956) that along strike, the
deposits mapped by Fisk (1 938 ,
1940) 豁出e Williana Formation in
Rapides Parish lie below the level of
the deposits of the Upland Allogroup
in the Fort PoIk region. The deposits
of the Upland Allogroup occur as
much as 200 丘 (60 m) above the top
ofFisk's (1 940) Williana Formation

Rapides Parish. The base of the
lowermost deposits of the Upland
Allogroup in the Fon Polk region 且es
barely leve1 with 出e top of the
Williana Formation and about 50 丘

further illustrates differences in the
stratigraphic position of the Upland
Al logroup in the Fon Polk region and
the Willi;:ma Formation across 出ε
Calcasieu River. He maps the Upland
Al logroup in the Fon Polk region as

in stratÏgrapruc position and lithology between

region 扭d the Williana Formation in
Rapides Parish demonstrate that 出ey
are different units of formation rank
within the Upland Al1 ogroup.
With regard to lithology and
stratigraphic position, the deposits of
the Upland Allogroup are identical to
the \X1iilis Formation of Doering
(1935) (Forney 1950; Bernard and
LeBlanc 1965; Aronow 1982). Thus
they are correlated with and designated as 出e Willis Formation in this
investigation. Contrary to previous

studies , this correlation implies 出at
the W il1 is Formation and Wil1i ana
命Formation are two di他rent strati回
graphic units. Funhermore, because
the deposits of the W i11i ana Formation lie more deeply entrenched into
the Miocene strata of the Gulf
Coastal province, with its surface
even lower 出an 由e youngest of the
W i1lis Formation, the W il1iana
Formation is dearly younger than the
W i11is Formation.

Sm吵 Facies-The sandy facies

Bianchi (1 982) first noted that
出e Willis Formation, which he
referred to as the "Citronelle FormatÎon ," consists of two recognizable
sedimentary facies , a sandy facies and
a gravelly facies (figure 22). The
sandy facies , which Bianchi ca11ed the
"fine sandy facies" of his "high
coastwise group," constÍtutes 出ebasa1
andmiddle p红ts of the Willis
FormatÍon. The gravelly facies ,
Bianchi's "graveliferous facies" of his
"low coastwise group," constÍtutes 出e
young臼t part of the Wi llis Formation
in the Fort Pollc region.

of the Willls Formation consists of
mostlyvery 岛le to medium sand and
muddy sand. These sediments
contain common dasts of purplish
day and silty day, with minor
缸nounts of coarse sand, gravel, day,
and silt. Commonly, the sandy facies
is largely massive, having been
homogenized by plant roots and
weathering. These sediments genera11y
exhibit sedimentarγstructures，
induding planar cross bedding,
trough cross bedding, ripple lamination , dimbing ripple lamination, and

scour-and-fill structures. The most
commonly observed sedimentary
structure in this investigation was
medium-sc a1e trough cross bedding.
Fine-grained sediments , which vary
from clay to silt, occur as isolated ,
commonly discontinuous , beds and
lenses. No evidence for any overa11
upward fining or coarsening trends
within the sandy facies was observed.
A prominent character of the
sandy facies is the presence of finegrained rip-up clasts. 1n va可lllg

rounded purplish clasts consisting of
clay to silty clay. These clasts typica1ly
r皿ge in diameter 丘om 2 to 5 cm (0.8
to 2 inches). The largest of these ripup clasts are in the cobble size range;
the largest rip-up clast we observed
was abour 8 cm (3 inches) in diameter, whereas Hinds (1997b) reported
rip-up clasts as large as 25 cm (10
inches). The rip-up clasts are 企e­
quently abundant enough to form
thin beds of rip-up-dast conglomerate. Also , they are typically found
concentrated along cross-beds and at
the base of scours. Whitish clay/mud
clasts of sand size commonly occur on
and delineate cross beds.
1n places the sediments are
gravelly and can indude discrete
gravel stringers on cross beds. 1n a few
places , they contaÌn a signifìcant
content of granules. Typically, the
gravel consists of subrounded to
subangular quartz clasts 1 to 2 cm
(0 .4 to 0.8 inches) in diameter. The
gravel occurs either scattered
throughour the sand or concentrated in ve可 thin to thin beds
and at the base of scours.

The sandy facies exhibits bright
and variable colors. Although predominantly various shades of red, the
sandy facies can va可 from red and
weak red to strong brown and yellow.
Some combination of these colors can
commonly be seen in one outcrop , as
illustrated by Figure 16 of Hinds
(1998a, 1999) , a measured section
located in SW/NW Sec. 24, T2N,
R?W; about 1.2 miles (2k m) northeast of Ar tillery Lake in the Simpson
South quadrangle [SC]. A measured
section in the northwestern MPRC
area (fìgure 23) illustrates similar
variation in the color within one
outcrop. The sandy facies in this
measured section exhibits pale
red purple 5RP 6/2 , p a1e
yellow 2.5Y 8/4 with
yellow 2 .5Y 7/8

mottles , reddish brown 2.5YR 4/4 to
red 2 .5YR 4/6, yellowish red 5YR 5/

yellow 2.5YR 6/8 coloration.
The only fossils observed in the
sandy facies of the Willis Formation
consist of rare petrifìed wood.

facies consists prima红r且yofc∞ommonl忖
yf
muddy, medium to cωoars巳 sands，
gravelly sands , sandy gravel, and
gravel. Like the sandy facies，也e
gravelly facies is 丘equently homogenized by plant roots or weathering.
The gravels and sandy gravels general悻 exhibit well-developed medium
to thick sets of trough cross bedding.
The sand beds show tabular and
trough cross bedding of varying
scales, and ripple lamination. Purplish
rip-up dasts identical to those found
in the sandy facies also occur within
this facies. No evidence for any
overall upward fìning or coarsening
trends within the gravelly facies was
observed during fìeld work.
The gravel consists of granule- to
pebble-sized chert gravel, with the
largest size frac!Ïon observed ranging
from 4 to 5 cm (1.5 to 2 inches).
Lenzer (1982) studied the composition of the gravel from a gravel pit in
the gravelly facies along Lo okout
Road between Birds Creek and
Sixmile Creek. As illustrated by Table
2, he found that the gravel consists
mainly of "dense" brown and brown-

ish gray chert with minor amounts of
other types of cherts , sedimentary
quartzite, and metamorphic qu缸tzite.
Quartz, which is abundant in the
gravel contained in the sandy facies , is
notíceably absent among the rock
types identifìed by Lenzer (1 982) in
gravel of the gravelly facies.
The only fossils found in 出e
gravelly facies are those contained
with血 scattered individual dasts of
the chert gravel, consisting of molds of
rare brachiopods, crinoid stems, and
corals; thus they are not native to 出e
WIllis Formation but rather reflect the
age and depositional environments of
出e Paleozoic carbonate rocks 仕om
which the chert was derived. Although
由ey fail to provide 皿y information
concerning the age and
p a1eoenvironments during 出e deposition of the Willis Formation，由ey
should provide some evidence concernmg 出e source of the chert gravels
found in the gravelly facies.
The generallack of fossils found
or observed wi出 in both the facies of
the Willis Formation implies 血红
conditions during the deposition of
the Willis were generally not conducive to the preserva!Ïon of fossils. The
coarse-grained character of the Willis
would have allowed for the oxidation
of organic matter and leaching of
bones and shells. In addition, intensive weathering of these sediments
during and a仕er deposition would
have preduded the preservation of
fossils; the petrifìed wood is preserved
because silicifìcation occurs relatively
soon after buria1.
The gravelly facies typically
exhibits various shades of red as
exemplifìed by red 2.5YR 5/8 gravelly
sand in the Fort Polk quadrangle
[S\l呵， in NE Sec. 12, TlS , R9币
This is also illustrated by a measured
section shown as Figure 22 of Hinds
(1998a, 1999) in NE/SW Sec. 5,
T1S, R7 W, in the Bird Creek quadrangle [S W]. In an abandoned gravel
pit, the gravelly facies is dark reddish

brown 5YR 3/4, red lOR 4/6 ,
yellowish red 5YR 4/6, and brownish
yellow lOYR 6/6. It also contains
purplish rip-up dasts, characteristic of
the Upland Allogroup in general,
colored 5RP 4/6 (Hinds 1998a,
1999).
The reddish, brownish, or
purplish ferric iron oxides that
pervasively stain , even cement, the
sediments ofboth the sandy and
gravelly facies show 出at the entire
Willis Formation has been highly
weathered to extreme depths. The
deeply weathered nature of the Willis
Formation reflects a number of
influences , induding (1) the high
initial permeability of the co缸se
parent materials, (2) the thickness of
the drained soil colunm above the
water table, (3) the comparatively
great age of the strata within the
Upland Allogroup relative to 出e ages
of younger, Quaternary strata, and (4)
contemporaneous weathering of these
strata during their accumulation 出 a
result of warm Pliocene paleodimates
(Aronow 1982).
((J3leached" Sediment.庐-Both the
sandy and gravelly facies contain
outcrops ofbleached-looking, grayish
sediments , not unlike those of the
Catahoula and Fleming in coloration ,
with red mottling in plac臼.Th臼ε
bleached sediments are typically
homogenous mixtures of sand, mud ,
and in places gravel. Abundant root
molds and haloes are commonly
associated with 出ese sediments. For
example , grayish, bleached sediments

Strat.伊q句y
τwürn习 or interpretations have
been proposed for the stratigraphy of
the Willis Formation within the Fort
Polk region. First, Welch (I 942) and
Doering (1956) inf位red 出at the
W i1lis Formation consists of a single
stratigraphic unit wi由 a gulfwatdtilted but high1y dissected terrace that

dips below the deposits of the Lissie
Formation~ The Lissie Formation was
interpreted as conformably onlapping
the deposits of the Willis Formation
in the Fort Poll王 region and extending
northward through its outcrop within
出e Mississippi Va11ey. Bianchi (1982)
showed the Willis Formation as
forming a single pediment cut into
the Miocene and forming a relatively
且at terrace surface (自gures 22 and
24). According to his interpretation
both the Willis Formation and its
terrace do not dip beneath the
deposits of the Lissie Formation but
rather ate truncated and completely
C山 out by it. Bianchi (1982) recog-

nized additional steps in the topography of the southern cuesta. He interpreted
these as erosion a1 surfaces cut across 出e Fleming (fìgure 24). For southeast Texas ,
Bernard (1 950) made an interpretation that combines aspects ofboth models: he
interpreted the Willis Formation as a single gu1且.vard-dipping unit truncated by
the Lissie Formation.
The production of the 7 .5ωminute geologic quadrangles and construction of
cross sections res u1 ted in an interpretation that is a modifìcation of the interpretation ofBianchi (1982). The topographic profìles confìrmed the existence of the
stepped topography discussed by Bianchi (1982) , but integration of data from the
geologic mapping reve a1ed that the base of the Wil1is Formation genera11y para11els
the concordant summits of each of the steps (fìgures 21 , 25-27). The steps are
interpreted to represent a series of relatively flat coast-para11el terraces underlain by
fluvial deposits of the W il1is formation. Each terrace is lower than the next terra臼
to the north , and the associated fluvi a1 deposits are correspondingly downcut into
the Miocene relative to the fluvi a1 deposits to the north. These terraces and
associated fluvi a1 deposits are inferred to be separated by erosion a1 contacts (fìgures
25-27); as such they are interpreted as allostratigraphic un Ïts.

obliterated. Even its fluvial deposits
have been reduced to erosional
remnants capping the east-west crest
of the southern cuesta and isolated
summits along the interfluves extending southward from it (直gures 20 , 25).

Because the southern cuesta
is deeply dissected by local drainages,
the sediments of these allomembers
are preserved only along 出e crests of
them斗 or interfluves between drainages. Al so , the deep dissection of the
Willis Formation has reduced the
surfaces of its al10members to a series
of concordant summits. In the case of
the Fort Polk allomember, all evidence of its surface has been

mapping, five informal
allostratigraphic units are recognized
and mapped: the Fort Polk, Ki satchie,
Dugollt Road, Tower Road, and
Gravel Hill allomembers (figures 2527). The Fort Polk and Ki satchie
allomembers consist of the sandy
facies. The Dugout Road, Tower

B硝al Contac•-As mentioned
above, the Fleming at its unconformable contact with the overlying Willis
Formation exhibits in many places
purplísh alteration of rectangular
blocky peds of its finer-graíned
sediment, extending about 1 m
dírecdy beneath the contact. The
sediments of the overlying Willis
Formation commonly incorporate
purplish clay/mud rip-up dasts. The
purplish alteration of the Miocene
and íncorporation of purplísh rip-up
clasts into the overlying Willis
Formation was observed at numerous
localities. "w甘ch (1942 , his fìgure 11)
depicted these relations at this contact
at the railroad-cut exposure of the
Blounts Creek at Pickering (figure
16). 1n thís investigation , the largest
such exposure found wi出 such
alteration of the Fleming lies just
northwest of a moving target at
approxímately the 4-9 lE, 34-4 0l'\f
UTM grid in the MPRC area, in the
Birds Creek quadrangle [NW], SCI
NW Sec. 4 , TIN, R 7W. Over a large
area at this loca1i r-y, "yellow 10ar丑" has
been stripped away from gray sandy
day of the Blounts Creek Formation,
whích is riddled with purple mottling
of peds in its upper portion (figures
18 , 19). Virtually identical motding
of the Miocene directly beneath the
contact, with 血corporation of

purplísh mud rip-up dasts into the
overlying reddish cross-bedded sand
of the Willis Formation, characterizes
grayish clayey ve可 fine to fine sand of
the Blounts Creek Formation in the
Fort Polk quadrangle [S W], in SW
Sec. 1, T 凹，即W. An exposure of
similar alteration in grayísh síIty clay
of the Castor Creek Formatíon was
observed in the Simpson South
quadrangle [S町， in NE Sec. 19 ,
T2N , R6W, on the east valley wall of
a tributary ofBrushy Creek. The
combined outcrop sketch and
measured section (figure 15) ofWillis
Formation sediments cutting out
those of the Carnahan Bayou Formation in the Peason quadrangle [S C],
SE/NW Sec. 30, T5N, R9W, depicts
both the purplish alteration of finergrained sediment below the contact
and the purplish clasts above 泣， as
well as some burrow casts of purplish
mud in reddish Carnahan Bayou
sand. The Willis Formation sediments
at this loca1i ty are also mottled
heavil严 in contrast to the Carnahan
üayûu, heiplng tû distinguishing the
t矶TO.

Not all of the obse凹ed contacts
between the Willis Formation and
Fleming Group exhibit this alteration
below 由e contact. For example , a
"clean" contact on unaltered Miocene
sediments was observed on the north

side ofLool王out Road west of Birds
Creek, in the Birds Creek quadrangle
[SC], in NE/SW Sec. 35 , T1N, R7职
At this exposure sandy conglomerate
and gravelly sand with substantial
admixed clay, of the grayish color
variant of the Upland Allogroup,
overlie grayish silt and very fine sand
of the Blounts Creek Formation. It is
lik啡 that such localities characterize
areas where the Willis cut more
deeply into the underlying Fleming,
and the purplish altered zone marking
the erosion surface on the Fleming
was entirely cut out.

Unfortunately, the lack of fossils
in the Willis Formation makes the

Dubar and others (1991) noted that
Kulda and Opdyke (1 972) reported
sediments with reverse magnetic
polarity 丘om the "Lissie," "Bentley,"
and "2nd terrace," which Dubar 扭d
。由ers (1 991) suggested are equivalent to thc Lissie Formation. This
indicates that 出e deposits of the
Lissie Formation and their associated
terraces are older 出租 0.75 million
years .
.As discussed previousl只 the Willis
Formation is older than the Williana
Formation found east of the C a1casieu
River and west of the Mississippi
River. Woodward and Gueno (1 941)
interpreted the presence of very large
boulders of chert, quartz时， sandstone , and petrihed wood within the
Williana as the result of downstream
transport by ice- rafting. In addition,
Fisk (1 939) found pebbles of igneous
rock and Baraboo Quartizite in
gravels of the Williana Formation.
Al though, as hypothesized by Autin
,

and others (1 991), these gravels
might belong to pockets of glacia1
outwash induded in the Williana
Formation a10ng the sides of the
Mississippi River Va11ey, the above
pebbles imply that the gravels are in
part of glaci a1-outwash origin. Being
older than 出e Lissie Formation, the
Williana Formation would, in part,
have formed during Early Pleistocene
or Late Pliocene glaciations. This
would imply 也就 the Willis Forma萨
tion is no younger than the Early
Pleistocene or Late Pliocene.
The lower limit of the age of Lne
Willis Formation is ∞nst血nedby
vertebrate faunas described 丘om both
出e Goliad Formation in Texas 皿d 由E
Fleming in Lo uisiana. The vertebrate
fauna 丘om the Castor Creek Formation of the Fleming Group is estimated
to be between 12.5 and 14.5 million
years old (Schiebout 1994, 1997).
The Willis Formation is signmcandy
younger 出姐也is， given 出e 出ickness

of the Blounts Creek FonnarÎon lying
between it and 出e vertebrate七earlllg
beds in the underlying Castor Creek
Formation. 1n Texas 出e Willis Formation overlies 由e Goliad Formation ,
containing the Lapara Creek Fauna,
estimated by Prothero and Manning
(1 987) to be 10 to 11 m血ion years
old. Taken together these faunas
suggest 出at 由e Willis Formation is

signi且cantly younger 由an 10 million
years old.
Vertebrate fossils correspondingly
provide am也cimum age for 出E
stratigraphic equiva1ents of the Willis
Formation , the Citronelle and
Miccosukee Formations, east of the
Mississippi All uvi a1 Va11ey. 1n the case
of the .Ashville local fauna of north
Florida, Huddlestun (1988) argued
that these late Barstovian vertebrate
fossils came from strata underlying
the Miccosulcee Formation. Thus , the
Miccosukee Formation postdates a
middle Miocene (late Barstovian) age
of about 11 to 16 million years
(Woodburne and Swisher 1995). 1n
southwest Al abama, the Mauvilla
loca1 fauna occurs in paralic- a11uvial
deposits of the "鸟1iocene coarse
dastics" of Raymond (1985) , which
underlie the Citronelle Formation.
The Mauvilla loca1 fauna consists of
late Miocene (early Hemphillian)
vertebrates that date these sediments
to about 7.0 to 9.0 m i1l ion years ago
(Hulbert and Whitmore 1997,
Woodburne and Swisher 1995). Thus
the Citronelle and Miccosukee
Formations are younger than middle
to late Miocene.
Within southeast Texas, Morton
and others (1 988) correlated the base
of the Willis Formation wi由 the

absence in the overlying Late Pliocen巳
and Pleistocene strata (Groot 1991;
Cronin et a1. 1993).
The period of geologic time
covering the Early Pliocene and late
Miocene epochs , 3.0 to 5.5 million
years ago , is hypothesized to be the
most likely time duri吨 which 出E
Willis Formation in the Fort Polk
region accumulated. The
unconformiry at the base of the Willis
Formation correlates best to a major
drop in sea level about 10.5 million
years ago (fìgure 28). During this
lowstand of sea level, deposition

within the Fort Polk area would have
shi丘ed southward, ending the
accumulation of the Blounts Creek
Formation of the Fleming Group
(Wornardt and Vai11991; Pa1eo田
Data, Inc. 1993). Between 5.8 and
10.5 million years ago, sea level
would have been low enough 由at
even during the highstands the edge
of coasta1 plain deposition would
have remained well south of the Fort
Polk region (fìgure 28). During this
time, erosion of the Fleming would
have occurred in r臼ponse to sea level
drop and ongoing upli丘. Between 5.5

benthic foraminifer datum. Taking
the arbitrary drop in datum in
account, the correlation by 岛10rton
and others (1988) implies that the
Willis Formation correlates with the
middle and upper portions of the
Bigenerina shale. Th巳 age of the
benthic foraminifer datums and the
correlation with the transgressive
Bigenerina sha1e imply that the Willis
Formation correlates with major sea
level highstands that occurred during
the Early Pliocene (Paleo-Data, In c.
1993) (fìgure 28).
This interpretation is consistent
with the fìnding of Kukla and
Opdyke (1 972) of normally magnetized sediments within the Willis
Formation. They interpreted the
normal magnetism of these seruments to represent the Gauss
polariry epoch, Chron C2An, 2.6 to
3.5 million years ago. However,
normal magnetism is a1 so consistent
with Chron C3n , 4.1 to 5.2 m i1l ion
years ago , which includes many of
the Early Pliocene sea level
highstands. Without additional
data, it is impossible to determine
which of these normal polariry
interva1 s these samples represent.
Finall严 Otvos (1 997) reported
the presence of trace amounts of

pollen from peats exposed in pits dug
into the Citronelle FormatÏ on at
Vancleave, Al abama, and Mossy
Head, Florida. As Otvos (1 997,
1998) argued, this precludes a
Pleistocene age for the Citronelle
FormatÏ on because the ]apanese
umbrella pine became extÍnct in
North America prior to the end of the
Pliocene. This is illustrated by the
presence 01' Sciaáopytis pollen in the
Pliocene-age Yorktown FormatÏon of
North Carolina and Virginia and in
the lower Beavertown FormatÏ on of
Delaware and New Jersey, and by its

and 3.0 million years ago , a series ofhighstands pushed sea level up to where the
inner edge of coastal plain deposition might have transgressed back into the Fort
Poll王 region during the highstands and resul时 in the deposition of fluvial sediments (Wornardt and Vai11991; Paleo-Data, In c. 1993). If so，由e Willis
Formation could represent this period ofhigh sea levels , while individual
allomembers represent individual highstands (自gure 28).
Otvos (1 997 , 1998) presented evidence ofhigher-than-modern sea level
highstands during the deposition of the Citronelle Formation. Such evidence
consists of 0.5- to 7.0-m四thick units composed of muddy sands and muddy,
pebbl严 fìne-to四coarse sands deposited in inshore and nearshore environments.
These strata are characterized by either Ophimoψha burrows produced by ghost
shrimp, the tubes of polychaete worms , the internal molds of veneroid and other
shallow marine bivalves , or some combination thereo f. Otvos (1997) reported
such marine beds near both the base and 出e top of the Ci tronelle Formation.
In theωe of the Citronelle and Miccosukee Formations , Huddlestun (1 988)
and Otvos (1998) have correlated them with Upper Pliocene, not Lower Pliocene,
sea level highstands. They consider the Miccosukee Formation and the correlative
Citronelle Formation in adjacent Florida to be of late Pliocene (Piacenzian) age.
Otvos's (1998) determination is based upon research 由at shows the Citronelle
Formation to overlie the fossiliferous Upper Pliocene Jackson BluffFormation in
也e Florida panhandle and upon Huddlestun's (1988) correlation of the
Miccosukee Formation with the microfossil-dated Cypresshead Formation of
eastern Georgia.
Given the uncertainties in correlations and facies changes between Florida
and south-central Louisiana, a Late Pliocene age for the Citronelle Formation in
Georgia and Florida fails to predude an Early Pliocene age for the Willis Formation in south-central Lo uisiana. However, it does imply that the younger
allomembers of the Willis Formation likely are of Late Pliocene 唔e (Figure 28). If
deposits ofLate Pliocene age exist within the Willis formation , the younger,
graveli岳rous Tower Road and Gravel Hill allomembers , which dosely resemble the
Citronelle Formation in lithology, would be the most likely candidates. In this
case, the major unconformity between the Willis Formation and the onlapping
Lissie Formation would represent a major lows

Intermeruate A11ogroup
Within w臼tern Louisiana, the Intermedíate Allogroup consísts of fluvi a1
deposíts of the C a1casieu and Sabine Rivers , their tributaries , and various coast过
plain streams. Thís a110group includes Strata and their associated terraces that have
been previously dassifìed as Bentley, Liss妃， DeRidder, and Montgomery. The
Intermediate All ogroup is topographic a11y higher 出an the terrace surfaces of the
Prairie Allogroup and topographically lower 出皿 the dissected uplands underlain
by strata ofboth the Upland Allogroup and Fleming Group. Al though generally
dissect址， terrace surfaces associated with the Intermediate All ogroup are recognizable as flat-topped ridge crests. Slightly south of the Fort Polk region in
west-centra1 lβuisiana， the Intermediate Allogroup consists of 100 to 300 丘 (30 to
90 m) of red, brown, and buff interbedded sand, silt , and clay (Autin et a1. 1991;
Dubar et a1. 1991; Snead et a1. 1998).
The Intermediate Allogroup is di佳rentiated from the Prairie Allogroup on
the basis oflithology, soils , slope , and degree of dissection of the associated
terraces. The terraces associated with the Intermediate Allogroup are more dissected and have steeper gulfvvard dips than the terrac臼 associated with the Prairie
Al logroup. In addition, the terraces of the Intermedíate Allogroup lack the relict
channels , meander-belt ridges , coasta1 ridges, and other constructiona1 topography
normally associated with the terraces of the Prairie All ogroup. In genera1, the
sediments of the Intermediate Allogroup are much sandier and have more mature
soils , mostly a1fisols，由an characterize the Prairie Allogroup (Autin et a1. 1991;
Dubar et a1. 1991).

Lissie Formation
The Lissie Formation consists of the deposits of the C a1casieu and Sabine
Rivers , their tributaries , and various coasta1 streams. The terrace associated with
the Lissie Formation consÌsts of an extensive ramplike surface that extends from
the edge of the Tertiar"'f Uplands southward into Calcasieu Parish. This terrace
surface dips to the south at 4 丘/mi (0.8 m/km) excepcwhere it Ís 0岱et by fa吐t­
líne scarps. The formation extends eastward a10ng the entire Texas coasta1 plain ,
where it was named, into Mexico , as illustrated by Bernard alld LeBlanc (1 965)
and Winker (1991).
Sma11 outcrops of the Lissie Formation were observed 01l1y wÌthin the
"Cooter's Bogs" area in the Fullerton La1王e quadrangle [SE, EC]. In 由is region, the
Lissie Formation is associated wi由 two coast-parallel terraces. A higher and older
te盯ace forms a narrow belt a1 0ng the edge of the Tertiary Uplands , and the
younger terrace is the northern edge of the extensive , gulfv飞rard-dipping surface
that extends southward from the study region into C a1casieu Parish. Welch (1 942)
mapped both of thes巳 terraces as the Bentley Terrace , as he did most of the Lissie
FormatÌon witÎlin the Fort Pollc regiûn.
In the "Cooter's Bogs" area, sma11 exposures of the Lissie Formation consist of
grayish clayey silt and very fine sand with yellowish brown mottles. 1n hand
specimen , these sediments superficia11y resemble sediment of the Flerning. They
contrast sharply with the sediments of the W i1lis Formatioll, which 缸e pervasively
stailled, even cemented, with reddish, brownish, and purplish ferric iron oxides. In
places, yellow loarn mantles these Lissie sediments.

As previously discussed, the Lissie FormatÏ on is likely Early Pleistocene in age.
In Texas , the Lissie Formation contains Pleistocene vertebrate fossils. Kukla and
Opdyke (1972) report sediments with reverse magnetic polarity 丘om the "Lissie,"
"Bentley," and "2nd terrace ," which Dubar and others (1 991) suggested are
equiva1ent to the Lissie Formation. These paleomagnetic data indicate that the
deposits of the Lissie Formation are older than 0.75 million years.
Prairie All ogroup (Undifferentiated)
The Prairie Allogroup consists of fluvi a1, deltaic, estuarine, and beach deposits of
late to middle Pleistocene age. It 且es topographically below 由e Intermediate Allogroup
and topographica1ly above the Dewe户rille Allogroup. The terrace s山也ces associated
Wl由出e Prairie Allogroup 袖ibit little dissection and commonly show relict constructiona1 topography (Autin et a1. 1991; Dubar et a1. 1991).
Within the Fort Polk region , the Prairie Al logroup consists of fluvi a1 sediments
that form discontinuous terraces found within the va11eys of local drainages. Hinds
(1998a, 1999) noted that the deposits of the Prairie A l1ogroup are recognized 臼
relatively flat areas lying slightly above the level of the Holocene flood plain. It can
be inferred from the types of soils associated with the terrac臼 of the Prairie
Allogroup that it consists largely of silts , silty sands, and sands within the Fort Polk
region , as described by Guillory (1997) and Martin and others (1 990).
Although its interna1 structure is poorly known, existing research shows that
the Prairie Allogroup consists of mult毕le va11ey-fìll complexes and coasta1 plain
sediments deposited by glacia1-interglacia1 cycles over the last 700,000 years.
Aronow and others (1 991) , Blum and Price (1 994, 1998) , and Winker (1 979)
have documented the presence of multistory sand bodies and major p a1eosols
within the Beaumont Formation of southeast Texas. In addition , Blum and Price
(1 994 , 1998) 皿d Van Siclen (1985 , 1991) mapped multiple highstand fluvi a1deltaic plains composing the Prairie A1logroup , Beaumont Formation, in the
Houston area. Using thermoluminescence dating, Blum and Price (1 998) defìned
va11ey fìlls that accumulated during 。可gen isotope stages 5 , 7，阻d 9. Fi nally,
seismic data interpreted by Thomas (1991) illustrate the presence of deposits of
older 。可gen isotope stages above the R6 regiona1 reflector. As sunimarized by
Blum and Price (1994 , 1998) , sufficient evidence exists to conclude that the
Prairie Allogroup consists of a complex assemblage of fluvial and deltaic deposits
representing m山iple glacia1-interglaci过 m卡vel cycles over 由εlast 700 ,000
years. Within southwest Louisiana, it appears that only deposits and landforms of
the last interglacia1 highstand of sea level compose the surface of the Prairie
Allogroup (Snead et al. 1998).

The unnamed alluvium is an informal n缸ne for the alluvial sediments 出at
underlie the flood plains of the streams and rivers witrun the Fort Polk area.
Although a stratigraphic unit of formation rank, it is le丘 unnamed until such time
as it is formally described. The unnamed alluvium fìlls valleys cut into older
sediments ranging from the Miocene Fleming Group to the middle to late Pleistocene Prairie Complex.
1n backhoe trenches excavated along the Whisky Chitto Creek, Cantley and
others (1 997) found the unnamed alluvium to consist oflight brownish gray

1n excavations at 16VN791 on
the flood plain of Birds Creek within
the MPRC area, Johnson (1 990且，
1990b) observed that the unnamed
alluvium at 出at site consisted of
brown 10YR 4/3 to dark yellowish
brown 10YR 4/6 silty sand and dark
brown 7.5YR 4/6 to strong brown
7.5YR 4/6 muddy sand overlying
brownish yellow 10YR 616 clayey
sand and light gray 2. 5Y 712 sandy
clay. Johnson (1990b) interprets the
muddy sands to be Bt horizons and
the clayey sand to be a truncated
Bt horizon of an older paleosol.
The unnamed alluvium at 16VN791
lS maSSIVe.
Judging from the limited
available information , the unnamed
alluvium consists of both Holocene
and late Pleistocene alluvium.
Based upon several dates obtained
by the Oxidizable Carbon Ratio
(OCR) dating method (see fìgure
29) , Cantley and others (1997)
concluded that the unnamed
alluvium within the Wh isky Chitto
drainage consists of alluvial deposits
of Holocene to Late Pleistocene
age. They argue that the upper 1 to
1. 5 m (3 to 5 丘) of the allu飞Tlum lS
of Holocene age and that the
sediments and paleosols lying below
a discontinuity at these depths dates
back well into the late Pleistocene.
Johnson (1 990b) also argued that
the alluvium at 16VN791 , which
lies on a tributaty ofWhisky Chitto
Creek, consists of 0.8 m (2.6 丘) of
Holocene alluvium as old as 5200
BP overlying a truncated paleosol
developed in late Pleistocene
alluvium. Similarly, Bianchi (1 982)
showed the unnamed alluvium as
consisting of alluvium of Holocene
ag民 "Alluvium 2B ," overlying that
of Pleistocene age , "Al luvium 2à'
(fìgure 22).
The limited observations by
Bianchi (1 982) , Cantley and others
(1 997) , and Johnson (1990b)
indicate that the unnamed alluvium
consists of a relatively thin accumu-

lation of Holocene alluvium over
late Pleistocene alluvium. If these
observations are substantiated by
additional study and are applicable
to other streams , they suggest that
the flood plains of the streams
within the Fort Polk region are far
more stable than previously thought
(Cantley et al. 1997). They suggest
that over the last few tens of
thousands of years the streams
within the Fort Polk region have
been gradually aggrading by the
periodic accumulation of sediments
on their flood plains. However,
given the relatively few places where
the unnamed alluvium has been
investigated in detail , additional
study is needed to substantiate
these obser飞rations.
BigBru均 Formation

The Big Brushy formation
consists of the mantle of sand that
forms the sandy epipedon of soils
developed on the Tertiaty uplands in
south-central Louisiana. The Blg
Brushy formation has also been
recognized within the Post Oak
Savannah of east-central1马xas
(Collins 1995; Fields and Heintich
1987; Thoms 1993) and the Piney
Woods of East Texas (Perttula et al.
1986).
The Big Brushy formation was
informa1ly named by Bianchi (1 984)
for the Big Brushy SÏte, 16VN24, a
stratifìed, m u1ticomponent site on the
east bank ofBig Brushy Creek in the
Flùlerton Lake quadrangle [SE]. At
the Big Brushy Site, the Big Brushy
formation was found to consist of 1.2
m (3.9 丘) of yellow, silty, fìne to very
fìne grained sand exhibiting no
discernible depositional stratigraphy,
and to contaÍn four stratifìed archaeological clusters representing 5扭
Patrice, Midd1e Archaic, Late Archaic,
and Ceramic components
(Guderjohn and Morehead 1980).
Unfortunately, the Big Brushy Site
has been destroyed by road construction , the geomorphological sturues

conducted at the sÏte were never
published, and its geomorphological
data remain missing. However, at sites
16VN1505 and 16VN126 northwest
of 16VN24 along Big Brushy Cree1王
and described by Meyer and others
(1 996) , deposits representative of the
character and stratigraphy of the Big
Brushy formation can be found
(Morehead 1999).
Detailed geoarchaeological
studies provide detailed descriptions
of the typical characteristics of the Big
Brushy formation in the Fort Polk
region. At 16VN794, the A and E
horizons consist of sil可 sand and the
Bt horizon consists of muddy sand.
As is often typical of the Big Brushy
formation , it can be a complex
mixture of sediment transported by
m u1tiple processes. Foss and others
(1993) ar伊ed that at 1 队尽'f794 its
sands were transported by both eolian
and slopewash pro.cesses (fìgure 30).
Color variations, gross lithology, and
visible stratigraphy primarily reflect
pedogenic processes that are continually modi马ring this unit. Additional
descriptions of the character of the
Big Brushy formation within the Fort
Polk region can be found in Gunn
and Kerr (1984) , Servello and Bianchi
(1 982) , and other reports concerning
出e results of archaeological excava国
tions in the Fort Polk region.
Detailed research concerning the
Big Brushy formation in Louisiana
and Texas demonstrates that it
consists of a sandy mantle produced
and modifìed by a variety of processes
(fìgl町e 31). Downslope transport of
出e serument can be the res u1 t of
either gullying, sheetwash, wind,
graviturbation , or some combination
of these processes. As a res u1t , the
thickest accumuÌâtÍûns of the Big
Brushy formation tend to be at the
bases of slopes or at breaks in the
slope on h il1s10pes. 1n some cases , it is
possible that wind can transport sand
upslope from exposed sand bars in
adj缸ent streams so that it can even

Structural Setting
The regional structural context of the study area is dominated by the Sabine
upli丘 and Angelina-Caldwell flexure updip to the north (fìgure 8). The Sabine and

Monroe up1i缸 in north Louisiana appear to have existed as positive features since
at least Late Triassic time (Anderson 1979) , when they formed along with other
positive elements that separated the "complex systems of rhombic grabens or rih
basins. …formed on thinned continental crust" (Foote et aI. 1992, p. 1) during the
early phase of separation of the North Arnerican plate 丘om the South Arn erican
andA丘ican plates (Salvador 198乃.
The Angelina-Caldwell flexure constitutes a hinge zone that marks an increase
in the dip and/or thid王ness of strata downdip. It formed on the south flank of the
Sabine upli丘 in conjunction with the overall regression and progressive outbuilding of the continental shelf during 由e Cenozoic, and marks a boundary between
epeirogenic upli丘 updip and basinal subsidence and deposition downdip, corresponding to the inner limit of gulf:Ward monoclinal dip toward Neogene
depocenters (Dixon 1965). The flexure could correspond to a boundary between
continental crust and thinner transitionaI crust (WorralI and Snelson 1989;
Walper et al. 1979). 1n the Sabine and Vernon Parish areas it influenced the
deposition of the Wilcox Group, which thickens notably across 出e flexure (Glawe
1989, his fìgure 3). Andersen (1 960) plac臼 its inception sometime du rÍng the
deposition of the lower Paleocene Porters Creek Formation (upper Midway
Group), based on isopach maps of the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene series that
show changes in thickness patterns across the f出ture beginning in the Porters
Creek interval (his plate 10). The trace of the flexure as drawn by different authors
varies considerably. 1n work undertaken in the context of petroleum exploration,
investigators have shown a tendency to depict it far to the south of where it is
shown in fìgure 8 (i n some ω臼 ne缸片 or virtually coincident wi出 the Lower
Cretaceous shelf edge or Toledo Bend flexure) , and also to join it with 出e Wiggins
antic1 ine in southern Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana (e.g. , Walper et al.
1979; Worrall and Snelson 1989). The usage of this report follows 出at of
Andersen (1 960; 1993 , his 直gure 56) , Dixon (1 965 , his plates 13 and 14) ,
Baumgardner (1987 , his fìgures 1 and 13) , and Glawe (1989 , his fìgure 1). This is

(1 993) argued that this results in a
situation in which archaeological

time dismembered and mixed. He
also argued that colluvial processes
and pedoturbation can act to reconstitute 阻 archaeological stratigrap hy

For this investigation, only the
portions of the Big Brushy where it
greatly exceeds its normal thickness are
mapped. These constitute a single

quadrangle [NW] and Lacamp quadrangle [SW]. Topographic relief within
this polygon exceeds 100 ft (30 m). Its
thickness as depicted in figure 27 is on
the order of 6 to 9 m (20 to 30 ft). Our

The age of the Big Brushy

1n addition t。由e influence of
the above regional structures , Hinds
(1998a, 1999) noted in his studyatea
a concordance of the strikes of
forrnations of the Flerning Group
(and, rnore strikingly, of the orientations of interfluves) with strikes in the
Austin Chalk (Upper Cretaceous) in
the deep subsurface as rnapped by
Zirnrnerrnan (1996). He interpreted
such concordance as suggestíng the
possibility of deep-seated structural
influence via harmonic folding.
The gentle dips and
serniconsolidated nature of rnost of
the Cenozoic sediment, together with
thick so i1s and vegetation, generally
prec1ude direct recognition of local
surf主ce structure in the study area.

Faults
The surface expression of the
An gelina-Caldwell flexure comprises a
zone of surf注ce fa吐ts with a cornplex
intersecting and anastornosing pattern
mapped by An dersen (1 960 , 1993).
1n sorne areas downdip of the rnain
zone of these faults , An dersen (1 960)
rnapped scattered srnaller faults.
These are reproduced on the accornpanying geologic rnaps in the
northwesternmost portions of Peason
阻d Ki satchie quadrangles , În the
areas where we have relied on
An dersen's rnapping of the Cockfìeld
Forrnation , Jackson Group , and
Vicksburg Group (fìgure 4). A
suggestion of a srnall fault was seen in
a single roadcut exposure in this
portion of our study area, in NW/SE
Sec. 28 , T6N, R9 W, Peason quadrangle [NC] , within 0 .4 krn (0.25 rni)
of faults to the northeast and southwest rnapped by An dersen (1960).
Aside 丘om this single locality, no

Joints
Strikes of systematic joints
(fractures without associated displacernent) could be rneasured at a nurnber
of localities. The joints are vertical or
neady so , and at rare localities where
joint faces are exposed to view, no
subsidiary features could be observed
on thern. Systernatic joints generally
consist of two rnain sets intersecting
at a 1吨h angle and cornrnonly
oriented orthogonally, or nearly so , at
a given locality. The above characteristics collectively suggest that these
joints are extension joints. An
exposure of the Blounts Creek
Forrnation of the Flerning Group in
the northwestern Big Creek atea, EC

The particular joint sets expressed

Geomorphic Setting
Within the Fort Polk region , three geomorphic terrains were recognized on
the basis of geomorphology. They consist of the coast-parallel terraces, the
stepped topography of the southern cuesta, and the ridge and ravine topography
of the northern cuesta.
Coast-Parallel Terraces
As previously noted, the southern and eastern edge of the Fullerton Lake
quadrangle is characterÍzed by gul五iVard-tilted， dissected terraces associated with
the Lissíe Formation. Along its contact wi由 the uplands of the sourhern cuesta, a
higher and older terrace forms a narrow strip about 1.3 to 2.1 km (0.8 to 1.3
míle) wide. Within the Fullerton Lake quadrangle, the surface of thís terrace
varies in elevation from 245 to 255 ft (75 to 78 m) above sea level. It is deeply
dissected by local drainages and truncated by a lower, younger, and regionally
extensive coast-para11el terrace that forms the top of the Lissíe Formation. This is
the northernmost edge of a large ramplike terrace that extends southward into
C a1casieu Parish at about 4 丘 per míle (0.8 m per km). The surface of thís
younger terrace lies at an elevation of about 225 丘 (69 m) above sea level, and it
is less dissected 由an the hígher terrace. St山，也eyounger te口ace has been modified by erosion to 也e poínt that relict constructiona1 1andforms have been
completely obliterated. Both of these coast-parallel terraces are former coasta1
plains that were formed during the Pleistocene.
Stepped Topography
The second terrain, which forms the southern cuesta, is characterÍ zed by a
gulfVvard-sloping cuesta dissected by southeastward drainages. Topographic
profiles show 出at the crests of the interfluves between the drainages showa
stepped profile. The correspondance between these steps and the base of the
Willis formation indicate 出at 由e steps are the remnants of a serÍ es of terraces
that has been reduced by erosion to a serÍes of concordant summits. ln places, the
sediments of the \Xfillis Formation have been completely stripped even from the
ridge crests. The direction of the drainag臼 was likely controlled by the regional
slope of the cuesta and the former terrace surfaces that once composed its surface.
Within the second terrain , the crest of the southern cuesta consists of the
relatively unconsolidated sands of the Willis Formation, which rÍs臼 above
lowlands underlain by comparatively consolidated dayey strata of the Castor
Creek FormatÍ on. Although part of this apparently contradictory situation~
involving unconsolidated sandy deposits forming a ridge crest towering above
lowlands underlain by more consolidated fine-grained deposits-might be 出E
result of structure, líthology also plays an important role. The sands show more
resistance to erosion than the clays because they have a higher infiltration capacit:y. Rain faUing onto the ~llÍck sands of the \Y/illis Formation in fi1trates readily
and flows through rather than on top of the unit (Markewich et a1. 1991).
Because of the low permeability of the dayey soils , rain fa11íng on hills underlain
by the Castor Creek Formation quicldy reaches its infiltration capacity. Water
rapidly collects on 出e surface or runs downslope as sheetflow. As a result, a much
heavier rain is needed to produce the sheetflow that would erode the surface of a
ridge or hill underlain by the Willis Formation than one underlain by the Castor
Creek Formation. Thus , when disturbed, the landscape underlain by the Castor

Creek Formation is much more prone
to erosion. In addition to such
episodic erosion by sheetflow，由e
Willís Formation is likely susceptible
to ongoing erosion by spring sapping
where it overlies the clayey Castor
Creek Formation, a10ng its map
contacts wíth the underlying clayiιat the edges ofWillis outliers
(Hinds 1998a, 1999 , his figure 17).
Ridge And Ravine Topography
Finally, the terrain that characterizes the northern cuesta of the
Kisatchie Wold wi出in the Fort Polk
region consists predominantly of
what is called "ridge and ravine
topography": rolling terrain with a
monotonous network of branching
valleys and low, rounded intervening
rÍdges and hills. This type of topography is an erosion a11y graded landscape
由at forms in humid climates (Hack
1960).
Within this terrain, the strata
have been so deeply eroded that all
constructiona1 topography, except the
terraces and flood plains withín
strearn va11eys, has been totally
destroyed. Di能rences in relief are
related to the relatíve resistance of
strata to erosion and distance from
the major trunk drainages. The
drainage network within this terraín
genera11y will have adjusted its courses
as it has cur downward, to exploit any
zones of wealcness a10ng structura1
features (Hack 1960). In addition,
sapping along joints and faults will
exert a strong control on the direction
ûf tributai丁ÿ entrenchment (Hay"vv;红d
et a1. 1990).

Structural Control
Richard P. McCulloh and
Paul V. Heinrich
Orainage lineaments are recognizable across the study area and suggest at least
a measure of structura1 control of drainage. No faults could be de自由tely inferred
to coincide with such lineaments. However, the systematic joints measured
provide a basis for comparison. Hinds (1 998a, 1999) , following up the suggestion
ofMcCulloh (1 995) 出at many drainage coursωin Louisiana reflect probable
control of their orientations by joints, compared measured joint strÌkes with
stream-course orientations in his study area. He concluded that a correlation likely
existed between the two , but his joint-strÌke data, comprising a tota1 of four
loca1 ities , ultimately did not permit more than a qua1 itative apprais a1 of the
suspected strength of such a correlation.
The joint roses shown in fìgure 32 are plotted on a base with a generalized
stream net for comparison. No clear relationship is discernible between the strikes
of measured joints and the orientations of drainage courses , even among those that
appe红 to constitute obvious lineaments on larger-sca1e maps. (Many of the latter
stream courses do not appear on fìgure 32 due to genera1ization for the reduced
scale.) The observed variability of expression of joint sets mentioned above may
account for this, possibly in conjunction with the sma11 sample size available for
this investigation. If structura1 control of drainage courses in the study area is re a1,
the phenomenon is evidently more complex than initia11y hypothesized. Estab1ishment of such a relationship , provided it exists, will 1ikely require more
comprehensive data th扭 those avai1able to this investigation-including both
greater qu扭tity 扭d a fìner level of detai1一扭d a statistica1 treatment of the data
such as that given by Scheidegger (1 980).
The flood plains of Comrade Creek and the C a1casieu River bear specia1
mention: 由ey appear to show strikingly di他rent exampl臼 of drainage 1ineaments.
These are notably straight yet broad reaches of fairly uniform width, which in
addition to having the same east-west orientation appear ra出er neatly a1 igned in
the north-south direction. The wide flood plains ofboth are crÌ ss-crossed by
numerous channels in 扭 anastomosing pattern. They do not fìt the defìnition of
stdke va11eys because neittl:ter is coincident with or para1lel to the contacts of the
Fleming subunits traversed, instead intersecting them at a low oblique angle. lt is

Springs are general1y the result of a groundwater table intersecting surface
flow onto the su出ce is through a natural orifìce. Such fea阳臼
areo丘en located on middle and lower slopes of hillsides or in stream channels.
They may be seasonal or perennial in nature, the latter dependent upon the lateral
extent of the recharge area or watershed, hydraulic characteristics of the permeable
zo肘， groundwater rese凹es， and hydraulic gradient. Some springs may be the
result of fault(s) cutting a confìned aquif古 at depth with resultant groundwater
flow upward along the fault plane to a point on the fault trace where it flows onto
the surface. There are a number of scenarios for which springs may result, but they
generally depend upon stratigraphic and structural relationships between surface
and subsurface strata.
Seeps occur generally where the groundwater table closelyapproximates
surface topography二 but does not intersect it. The distinction between a seep and a
spring is the existence of a visible orifìce and rate of flow for the latter, though in
the literature the distinction seems to blur and is left to the reader as intuitive.
There does not appear to be broad agreemem on what constitutes a threshold
value for rate of flow, but a se巳P is general1y referred to as a smal1 area where water
percolates slowly to the land surf注ce (Bates and Jackson 1980) , but where neither
an orifìce nor the rate of flow is readily visible through observation. A spring is a
place where groundwater is observed to flow natural1y onto the land surface
through a natural orifìce.
Bogs generally occur where there is sufficient water trapped in a topographic
depression in the land surface. Such depressions may be fed by precipitation,
surface runo旺: or subsurface water. If a bog is the result of either precipitation or
surface runo旺: the base of the bog will be composed of a low permeability materlal , such as a fìne-grained silt or clay, in order to trap the water and prevent
subsoi1 infìltration. The si1t or clay unit at the base of the bog is 0丘en a remnant of
a prior erosional surface (Smith 1996). Mapping such erosional surfaces in order
to gain insight into the lateral extent of the bog's watershed boundaries Call be
challenging because present day topography may not reflect 出e general slope and
drainage pattern of the older erosional surface (Smith 1996). Bogs formed in this
manner may be perennial or seasonal

bogs, are unique localized wetlands,

complex. Inflow into the bog may
either be the result of a groundwater
table intersecting surface topography
where flow is through a natural
orifice, as in the c出e of a spring, or
出er臼ult of a groundwater table that
lies just beneath the surface at a

South Group
A number of observations were noted for 由e area represented by the southern
quadrangles of Fort Polk, Birds Creek, and Fullerton Lake when merged with 由e
Aquifer Recharge data (figure 33). First, the spatial characteristics of the bog
polygons situated atop the Evangeline aquifer appear to lie closer to the
Evangeline-Chicot contact 由an polygons occurring on the Chicot aquifer side of
也e same contact. A possible explanation lies in the methodology for compiling
the regional aquifer map. The contact in qu口tion has been grossly oversimplified
in order to accommodate the scale (1:250 ,000) of the base map. 1t is shown in
figure 33 as a distinct and regular line implying a definite , linear contact between
the two aq出fer systems. 1n reality, however, this may not be 由e case. Upon
examination of figures 另一37， the contact between the Evangeline (Pliocene to
late Miocene age) and Chicot!1是rraces (Pleistocene age) aquifers is highly irregular. 1ts location as depicted on figure 33 may be erroneous; thus this observation
may be invalid.
Second, while the bog polygons appear scattered, the scatter appears to be
restricted to an arcuate , northeast-trending band that p红allels 出e contact between
the Evangeline and Chico t! Terraces aquifers (且gure 33). This observation may be
the result of two integrated factors. Fi rst, the oversimplification of the EvangelineChicot aquifer contact discussed earlier may alter the apparent arcuate linear
nature of the trend. 1f the irregular nature of the contact were more apparent, the
apparent arcuate trend could be less obvious. Second, the northern boundarγof
bogs comprising this regional trend may be influenced by the data collection
methodology. The data provided to LGS applies only to Kisatchie National Forest
(KNF) property, which includes only the southern portion of the Fort Polk
Military Reservation. Bog sites were not mapped beyond the (卧JF) boundary.
Close examination of figures 35-37 appear to indicate a truncation ofbog
polygons upon reaching the KNF boundarγespecially in the Birds Creek and
Fullerton Lake quadrangles (且gures 36, 37). This data acquisition limitation was
confirmed by Phil Hyatt (1 999). Thus what appears to be a narrov飞 arcuate，
northeast-trending band is more a function of the data collection methodology
and its limitations 由an it is a hydrologic or geologic characteristic.
The third observation is that a clear majority of bog sites appears to b

might be expected.

Merging the bog data wi由 the geologic maps created for this report reveals a
greater level of detail regarding the relationship of specifìc bog sites to the geology.
The quadrangles covered 红e Fort PoU王， Birds Creek, and Fullerton Lalce (句ures
35 , 36, and 37, respectively). Exduding 出e previous observations discussed above ,
bog sites appear to be restricted to the Blounts Creek Member of the Fleming
Group and to the younger Willis (Pliocene) and Lissie (Pleistocene) formations.
The Blounts Creek Member of the Fleming Formation is the youngest unit
underlying and truncated by Plio四Pleistocene strata in the study area. The authors
of this report refer to 出e Blounts Creek as a nondescript series of dayey and silty
fìne-grained materials and as the fìnest-grained of the various sandy Fleming
subunits. They also report that it has a much fìner grain size overall than the other
formations within the Fleming. This may account for the apparem preference of
bog sites for Blounts Creek sediments , at least in the Fort Polk quadrangle. But
this observation tends not to hold when examining the Birds Creek and especially
the Fullerton Lake quadrangles (fìgures 36 扭d 37, respectively). Bogs tend to be
evenly distributed between both Blounts Creek and Willis formations on the Birds
Creek quadrangle (fìgure 36) but tend to also occur on the Lissie Formation in the
Fullerton Lake quadrangle (直gure 37).
There are a number of possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the
restrictive nature of the data collection methodology (restriction to 刚F land)
may be skewing the real nature of the relationship by creating an apparent one.
What appears to be an affinity for Blounts Creek, Will1s , and Lissie geologic un1ts
may be an artifact of sampling bias.
Close examination of fìgures 35 ，元， and 37 shows that the bogs are located
on a wide range of geologic and hydrologic units. The Evangeline Aquif七r System
consists of Bloums Creek and Wi1lis geologic formations while the Chicotl
Terraces Aquifer System consists of various permeable units within the Lissie
Formation and undifferentiated alluvium (Table 4). From this perspective, bogs
appear to be scattered throughollt the two dominant aquifer systems for 出ε
region, and it 1s thus difficult to suggest that bogs are somehow restricted only to
certain aquifers.
The tendency ofbogs to show an affinity for certain locations is probably
related more to localized lithologic and textural considerations 出an to specifìc
geo

ents be present. Blounts Creek is a nondescript
series of dayey and silty fìne-grained materials, and
it has a much fìner grain size overa11 when compared
to the other formations within the Fleming. The
Willis and Lissie formations are more sandy and
contain gravel throughout, but they also exhibit a
wide range of lithologies and textures. Where the
proper mix of fìne- and
coarse-grained materia1s
coexist, conditions may
be present for 由e
development of a bog.
It is important to note,
however, that while
specifìc textural 阻d
lithologic characterÍstics
may create favorable
locations for bog
development, this in
itself does not guarantee

North Group
Bogs that occur in the northern
region of the study area (figure 34)

of water transmission. These include
soil associations possessing a variety of
both high and low recharge characteristics. The bogs of the south cluster,
located in the sourheast quadrant of
the Kisatchie 但ld northeast quadrant
of the Kurthwood quadrangles (figure
38) , displaya di任erent spatial relationship , tending to be less scattered,
concentrated in a rather restricted
area. They are situated on sur且cial
material characterized by low recharge
potentia1一-i.e. ， poorly drained silts
and clays with slow to very slow
111自ltration， low permeability rates ,
and high runoff potential. These
include shallow soils over nearly
impervious materi a1s and soils vvith a
claypan or a thick clay layer at or near
the surface.
While the spatial characteristics
of the two clusters ofbogs di他r， both
lie upon geologic materials characterized as Miocene aquifers (Boniol
1988). The 岛1iocene aquifers of
central LouÍsiana include most of the
Fleming Group , beginning with the
Castor Creek confining units at the
top of the sectÏ on and extending
downward Io and inchlding the
Catahoula (1油le 4). Close examination of1油le 4 reveals 出at the
Miocene aquifer system includes
Upper Oligocene-age sediments. This
apparent inconsistency is due to past
uncertainty regarding the geologic age

of the Catahoula aquifer. The Aquifer
Recharge Map (Boniol1988) considers it to be 1βwer Miocene in age,
while the authors of this report map 让
as Oligocene. The specific 唔e ofthis
aquifer is urumport但1ttO 出is discussion; it is considered as part of the
Miocene Aqui如 System for this report.
An explanation that will adequately account for the two clusters
may be difficult to identify. Clearl严
virtually all of the Ki satchie quadrangle falls within KNF, except for a
narrow band along the western edge.
Thus the argument discussed earlier,
由at bog data is an artifact of the
collection methodology, is not valid
in this case. However, the sourhern
extent of bog sit臼 on the Kurthwood
quadrangle does appear to be a
function of the KNF boun也可·
But this explanation does not
account for 出e wide spatial variability
of bog density between the north and
south clusters , which suggests different controlling mechanism(s). These
mechanisms may be reflected in the
recharge potential of the surficial
materials upon which the bogs are
located, but figure 34 does not
di佐rentiate between individual
formations comprising the Miocene
Aquifer System.
50 another approach was tried:
merging regional bog data with the
detailed geology mapped for this
region. Figure 38 illustrates refineme11ts not observed on the regional
map (且gure 34). For example, in 出e
north cluster more scattered bog
polygons are situated atop Catahoula
(Oc) material. Those of the sourh
cluster, on the other hand , are
situated on Carnahan Bayou (M丘b).
Utilizing this approach , bogs appear
to be scattered throughout the two
dominant aquifers for the region, the
Carnallan Bayou and Catahoula
aquifers. Thus it is difficult to suggest
that bogs are somehow restricted only
to certain aquifers.

The stratigraphic units comprising the Miocene Aq uifer System that occur in
this region were described earlier in this report as comprising alternating coarsergrained，自uvial-dominated lithofades and fìner-grained , more marine-influenced
lithofades. In terms of gross textures , the Carnahan Bayou (M丘b) is similar to
Catahoula (Oc) , with both encompassing a wide range of sediments that are
texturaIIy heterogeneous , poorly sorted, and comprise various admixtures of sand,
silt, and day. From examination of the data sets from a variety of approaches , it
appears that the critical geologiclhydrologic factor is that of textural and Hthologic
relationships. At the present 由ne and based upon 出e data available, it appears 出at
bogs have an a血nity for locations that exhibit fìne to very fìne grained material
juxtaposed beneath coarser grained material, a sirnilar conclusion to 由at reached fòr
the South Group of bog sites.
This hypothesis was again tested by exanlining the descriptive fìeld-map notes
recorded by McCulloh and Heinrich as part of their geologic mapping task for this
repo比 Field-map notes were examined for 出e Ki satchie and Kurthwood quadrangles in those areas where bog sites had been identi自ed. Again, very few outcrop
sites occur in dose proximity to bogs , and none correspond with spedfìc bog
locales. In由e few instances where geologic outcrops were noted and could be
correlated to n臼rby bogs，出e fìeld description generaIIy tended to support 由c
hypothesis, but the lack of suffident data predudes any defìnitive condusions.

Summary
This investigator has examined the hydrologic relationships between the bog
sites and 出巳 aquifers， but viable explanations that can withstand scrutiny are not
available at this time. A number of possibilities have been examined and discussed
(above) , but none 。他rs a basis for a reliable predictive model. Wh at is evident is
that bogs appear to duster on a variety of geologic formations of varγÍng ages
represeming a number of aquifer systems. A controlling factor may be lithology
rather than spedfìc geologic formations or aquifers. Because of the limitations of
this study, however, it is tenuous at best to sugg'臼t a predictive model. Examination of fìeld notes on various working copies of fìeld maps of individual
quadrangles su自由ts that a link may exist between localized lithological variations
and bog sites. But th臼εnotes were not co l1 ected with this purpose in mind, and
therefore neither 红e they complete nor do they contain adequate descriptions at
spedfìc bog locales. 'vv也ile a relationship may exist, the predse nature of this relationship is difficult to postulate without fur出er fìeld study.

Nonrenewable commodities of potential economic signifìcance in the Fort
Polk region comprise gravel , sand, crushed stone , and opal. Actual and potenti过
economic occurrences of these materials are rendered on the Economic Geology
plates, totaling seven of the ten quadrangles malcing up the study 红四. Ground
water is also a commodity of economic signifìcance in the region , but its economic

Gravel in economic concentrations is confìned to the gravelly facies of the
Pliocene Willis FormatÎon. Gravellenses are also known to occur in the Carnahan
Bayou Formation of the Miocene Fleming Group, but none of these has proved
economic. Sand has local but variable economic potential within the coarsergrained Fleming subunits and in Quaternary strata. The only sand excavations
observed in the conduct of this investigation were the ones noted in the Carnahan
Bayou Formation in Dowden Creek quadrangle [WC], in SE Sec. 25 , T4N ,
R10W(自gure 14). The greatest potenti过 for crushed stone resources is in the
Catahoula Formation outcrop belt, consisting of sedimentary quartzite. This is

Another excavation for crushed stone , composed of what we infer to be

Hazards

Flooding
Flooding is inferredωconstitute the sole geologic hazard in the study 红四­
Flood-hazard potential is rendered on the attached plat臼仕om a compilation of
publicly avai1able data distributed by 配 Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) and modifìed based on flood-plain topography interpreted from 出E
topographic base information. The areas delineated are those interpreted to lie
within the 100-year flood plain.

Landslides
Landslide potential was also evaluated, but was found to be not predictably of
su伍dent magnitude to constitute a signifìcant hazard. The comprehensive
account of the categories and contexts of landslide failure developed by Hernandez
(1 990) in north Lo uisiana served as a guide in this evaluation because, although
landslide occurrence in southwestern Louisiana was surveyed by Smith (1 987) , he
focused exclusively on man-made embankments. Of the situations susceptible to
landslide fai1 ure outlined by Hernandez (1 990) , those involving a combination of
slope steepn臼s and clay content of the substrate are most applicable to the present
study area. Accordingly, we evaluated landslide-hazard potential based on a
co时 unction of steep slopes and clay/mud substrates. Regional overviews of
landslide-hazard susceptibilíty (Radburch-Hall et al. 1982; Walker and Coleman
1987) , while indicating none for the study area, show the areas with known hazard
susceptibílity in Louisiana as coinddent with the Míssissippi rÍver flood plaín and
delta plaín. 1n light of the above considerations, the authors felt that 由e steepest
slopes ín the study area would be those assocíated with flood plaíns of the rÍvers
and streams , and that any a纪as of signifìcant landslide-hazard potential that might
occur could be defìned based on a coincidence of valley walls and channel
cutbanks with clay substrates.
The channel cutbanks within flood plaíns are the steepest slopes found in the
study area. These erode both clayey and sandy subfades of the alluvium which,
however, was not di也rentiated in this investigation. Thus , while the authors 先lt
that occurrences of a conjunction of river and stream cutbanks and clay/mud
substrates would be spotty, in any case it was not feasible to predict them. Af无er
cutb缸巾，也e steepest slopes are those along the valley walls delineating the flood
plaíns and bottomlands of streams and rÍvers. These slopes are essenti过lyallless
than 100 , and the steeper of them tend to occur where flood plains course across
the outcrop belts of the sandier lithostratigraphic and lithofacies units ofTertiary
age. The potenti过 for forma tÌ on of slopes greater than 100 .l n the muddier units
was therefore evaluated as insu旺ìdent to cons tÏtute a substantiallandslide hazard.

The surface of the Fort Polk region is underlain entirely by Cenozoic strata,
composed of terrigenous sediment ranging in age from Eocene to Holocene and
comprising varying admixtures of sand , silt, clay, and some gravel. The sediment is
virtua11y a11 poorly sorted and was deposited in environments transition a1 between
fluvial and shallow-marine, but collectively these strata show a domillantly
progradationa1 character and become increasillgly terrestri a1 upsection. The greater
part of the surface is ullderlaill by relatively coarser-grailled sediment of the
Catahoula and Fleming圭 the Upland AJlogroup, and Holocene alluvium. These
Cellozoic strata show gelltle, homoclin a1 dip toward the G tÙ f of Mexico basill;
regioll a1 structura1 dip is low, averagillg 10 or less. Surface structure is likely to be
subtle except for faults , but ill anyωe is genera11y not directly recognizable solely
from surface observations. Nonfuel miller a1 commodities of potentia1 economic
signifìcance comprise gravel and groulld water. The only recurrent geologic hazard
that can be projected systematica11y within the region is flooding.
Three main objectives of this investigatioll were listed at the begilllling of this
report: providillg the U.S. Army with basic geologic data essentia1 to the collduct
of environmenta1 applicatiolls and programs at Fort Polk, extellding the work of
Hillds (1 997a, b; 1998a, b, c; 1999) and the stratigraphic and geologic context of
the Fort Polk Miocene vertebrate fossillo ca1ities (Schiebout 1994, 1997;
Schiebout et a1. 19%) , and supporting the Lo uisiana Geologica1 Survey's geologic
mapping efforts in the Fort Polk region alld vicinity (Louisiana Geological Survey
1993; Snead et a1. 1998). It is the authors' belief that these 0问 ectives have beell
met-the fìrst 0问 ective principally by the accomp阻yingm叩s (Plates 1-27) , the
second by the report and Plates 1-10 , and the third princip a11y by Plates 1-10.

Subsurface Geologic

Sectio 口 S

Subsurface work done for this investigation utilized a database consisting of ∞pies
of electric logs of oil & gas wells and water wells available 出rough theLo山siana State
University Basin Research Institute (now the Basin Research Energy Section of the
1βuisiana Geological Survey) and 由e U. S. Geological Survey Water Resourc臼
Division district office in Baton Rouge. From trus database we constructed subs田白白
geologic sections a丘er 也e manner ofRogers and Calandro (1965) and Hinds (1998a,
1999). A comprehensive regional study of the electric-log character of subsurface
units-involving mapping of gross e-log facies and inferred depositional envllonments
for 由e stratigrapruc units mapped at the surface-would have considerable vah泣， but
was beyond the s∞pe of this investigation.
Subsurface data available to us in and near the study area and examined for
this investigation totaled 95 electric logs of oil & gas 扭d water wells. Copies of
the logs were correlated with one ano白白扭d 由e intercepts then used to construct the following sections ("stick" sections-the deadline placed on the
completion of the original project did not permit incorporation of the trac臼 ofthe
electric logs on the sections). Based on the ar巳且1 distribution of available data, fìve
lines of section were chosen. These were construc时 primarily to check and veri今
the concordance of subsurface information with the surface mapping and to show
出e subsurface confìguration of stratigraphic units mapped at 由e surface. Placement of the sections was designed as much as possible to complement, but avoid
duplicating, the geologic subsurface sections previously made by Rogers and
Calandro (1965) and Hinds (1 998a, 1999). Intercepts 缸e projected in places
beneath the total depths of shallower wells, as well as across the upper interva1s
masked by surf主ceωing， for the sake of continuity. The sections were produced
using the facilities of the Louisiana State University Basin Research Institute.
Section B-B' sugg口ts possible offset by a fault between two of its wells;
evidence for this is discussed under Structure in the section entitled Faults. One
section, D-D飞 was constructed specifìcally to correlate the Castor Creek Forma皿
tion of the Fleming Group to its outcrop at the Discovery vertebrate-fossil site, in
mder to ascertaÍn the position within the Castor Creek Ínterval of the fossiliferous
conglomerate and sandstone beds cropping out at the surfàce there. The sect
