PREFACE TOTHE 1989 LIMITED EDITION REPRINT

In celebration of the 60th year of the Texas Archeological Society,
this reprint of the societyâ€™s Special Publication Number i, one of our most
successful publications, was undertaken with the permission of its senior
author, Dr. Dee Ann Story (nee Suhm). None of the text or photographs have
been changed or updated from the original 1962 edition, which is com~idered
a classic in the field. Those who need current distributional and dating
information may wish to consult more recent publications.
For those interested in modifying the pottery or projectile type
descriptions presented in this volume or proposing new types, please note
that a standing Typology Committee now serves as the clearing house for
Texas type information (rather than the Editorial Policy Committee, as
:indicated in the Introduction to this volume, page viii). You may send
your information, proposals, and illustrations to the TAS Typology
Committee in care of the office of the society. The current address is:

Introduction
An.Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology, which appeared as Volume 25 of the
Bulletin, was intended to be a summary of
Texas archeology as it was known in 1954. It
sought to achieve this end by presenting synopses and trait lists of the culture complexes
recognized in Texas (Part I), and by describing in detail certain pottery and proiectile
point types (Part II). By 1956 the Handbook
was out of print.
At the 1958 annual meeting of the Society,
the membership authorized, by maiority vote,
the reissue of the Handbook. The authors conferred about the proposed reissue and agreed
that ( 1 ) Part II of the Handbook-the section
on typology-should be reissued as soon as
possible in loose leaf form (so that future revisions and additions of types could easily be
inserted), and (2) that Part I-the areal section containing descriptions and trait lists of
the l:ecognized archeological complexes of
Texas-be issued separately at a later date.
This, then, is the reissue of the type definitions (with minor revisions ) which originally
appeared in Part II of the Handbook. The type
definitions presented here are regarded as preliminary in the sense that they are subiect to
change and revision. As more and more field
data become available, some of these types
will undoubtedly be discarded, others may be
split into varieties, and there may be reason,
in some cases, to consolidate two or more into
a single type. It is expected that all of them
will require future modification of one sort or
another, some more so than others. In order to
permit easy revision of the types, as well as
easy addition of new types, a loose leaf format
is being used. It is hoped that this will be the
beginning of a series which eventually will

include not only pottery and projectile point
types, but also knife types, scraper types,
house types, burial types, basketry types, ornament types, bone implement types, and so
forth. In other words, this is designed as a
cumulative compendium of typology in Texas
to which anyone may contribute typological
data at any time. As new type definitions and
revisions of existing type definitions are received by the Editor of Publications, they will
be considered for publication as supplementary sheets to be added to the series.
This initial series of types is organized under four sections: pottery, large stemmed
points, dart points, and arrow points. In the
original Handbook, pottery descriptions were
grouped under six different sections: Caddoan
Pottery Types, Coastal Pottery Types, Central
Texas Pottery Types, North-Central Pottery
Types, Panhandle-Plains Pottery Types, and
Trans-Peeos Pottery Types. Here all the pottery types are arranged alphabetically-as are
the large stemmed points, the dart points, and
the arrow points-rather than by areas.
While it would have been desirable to reevaluate completely all of the types, this was
entirely out of the question because of time
limitations. Therefore the type descriptions
here, by and large, are identical to those in the
original Handbook except for the correction
of a few errors, the addition of some new data,
and the rewording of several passages.
The pages have been numbered to permit
accurate citation. The page numbers of supplemental sheets issued in the future will follow in the same sequence, although most
persons will probably wish to insert them alphabetically in the appropriate sections.
All archeologists, both amateur and profesvii

descriptive category, but must have cultural
and historical meaning if it is to be employed
successfully as a tool for areheologieal interpretation. Consequently each proposed type
should be supported by distributional data
(both geographical and temporal ) and should
be keyed to foei, aspects or other mâ€™eheological assemblages with which it occurs.
This, naturally, requires a substantial amount
of research before a type can be defined
accurately.
This is not intended as a guide for identifying artifacts-no matter what their provenience-simply by comparing specimens to the
illustrations. To use one of the type definitions
properly, it is essential that the entire definition (the written description, the distributional and associational data, and the illustrations) be taken into account. For example,
arrow points that are quite similar to the
Perdiz type in shape, size, and chipping occur
in California, in Spain, and in Japan. These fit
the physical description of Perdiz rather well,
but they do not fit the geographical and terr~.
poral position of Perdiz; therefore, they should
not be called Perdiz points-unless future
distributional and associational studies produce strong evidence that they are historically related to the ones in Texas. Continuity
in distribution of a type is the principal criterion for demonstrating that it is a valid cultural entity. In short, these are cultural types,
not descriptive types, and they should not be
used out of context because to do so would
imply cultural relationships that may not have
actually existed.
In view of the importance of artifact types
to archeologieal interpretations, it is hoped
that in the future all archeologists working in
the State will contribute data to the series so
that Handbook of Texas Archeology: Type
Descriptions can be kept up to date.
EDWAttD B. JELKS

sional, who have the requisite data to define
new types or to make significant revisions of
existing types are urged to write them up and
submit them to the Editor of Publications of
the Society for inclusion in the series. The
Editorial Policy Committee, consisting of the
President, Secretary-Treasurer, and Editor of
Publications, will evaluate each submitted
type description before approving it to make
certain that it is (1) based on sut~eient data
for validity, and (2) is adequately described
and illustrated.
Each type description submitted should
follow the same outline form as those appearing in the initial issue. In addition, each new
type should contain under the heading of
"REFERENCES" the complete bibliographic
citation (for form see "References Cited" in
the initial issue) so that in the future it will
never be necessary to issue an addendum to
the bibliography. Two other headings, "Workmanship" and "REMAltKS," may be added
to the initial outline, if they enhance or clarify
the type description. For an example of how
"workmanship" and "remarks" are to be used
see the description of Meserve points. Plate
dummies should be of such proportions that
they can be reproduced on a 81~â€™ by 11 inch
page with appropriate binding and other
margins, and so that projectile points and
other small artifacts appear full size on the
printed page. Perhaps the easiest way to prepare the plates for small artifacts is to make all
photograph prints and drawings life size, and
then to mount them on 81~â€™ by 11 sheets of
poster board with allowance for suitable margins. Illustrations of pottery vessels and other
large artifacts which cannot be shown full
size should be reduced to proportions that
will fit the 8~ by 11 inch format, and a centimeter scale, such as those in the initial issue,
should appear on the plate.
All type definitions should be based on the
same typological theory as those of the original Handbook. That is, a type is not just a

Acknowledgments
While the bulk of the specimens studied and
illustrated in Part II of the Handbook were
collected by the Department of Anthropology,
The University of Texas, many individuals
have, over a period of years, contributed significantly to the type descriptions. They have
given or loaned specimens to the Department,
or have permitted their collections to be
photographed and analyzed. It is impossible
to acknowledge adequately all persons involved; however, the materials and information provided by certain individuals have been
extensively used. These persons deserve special attention: Wilson W. Crook, Jr. of Dallas;
Joe Green of Hereford; 1~. K. Harris of Dallas;
Dr. and Mrs. T. L. Hodges of Bismarck,
Arkansas; Jack T. Hughes of Canyon; H. J.
Lemley of Hope, Arkansas; M. P. Miroir of
Texarkana; I. B. Price, Jr. of Atlanta; l~obert
Proctor of Arkadelphia, Arkansas; C. N. l~ay
of Abilene; Clarence H. Webb of Shreveport,
Louisiana; Joe Ben Wheat of Boulder, Colorado; and l~. B. Worthington of Houston.
In addition to these individuals, the following institutions have generously provided information-by permitting theh" collections to
be photographed and studied-helpful to the
type descriptions: the University of Arkansas,
the University of Oklahoma, Texas Teehno-

logical College, the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society, and the Texas Memorial Museum.
Finally, we are indebted to the Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, The University of Texas Press, the Oklahoma Anthropological Society, and the Texas Archeological Society, who have been most cooperative
in permitting reproduction of certain illustrations from their publications (Bell, 1953;
Moore~ 190S, 1909, 1912; Sellards, 1952;
Webb, 1946).
In editing the type descriptions of the Handbook for the present series, a number of
specialists on Texas archeology reviewed the
Handbook descriptions and offered suggestions as to how they might be improved and
brought up to date. Persons who contributed
to the revised descriptions are: T. N. Campbell, Wilson W. Crook, Jr., E. Mort Davis,
1~. K. Harris, Jack T. Hughes, Alex D. Krieger,
Mardith K. Schuetz, and Clarence H. Webb.
All of the above made valuable suggestions for
which the editors of the initial issue in this
series are greatly indebted.
Special acknowledgement is due for the art
work to: Hal M. Story who designed the cover
and made most of the pottery drawings, and
to Chris Jelks who drew the ttockport Incised
and Rockport Plain sherds.

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE

deep, nearly cylindrical bowls with sides
slightly convex or with rims gently curving
outward (Plate 2, A, B, D, F, I) are also
common and range from 6 to 20 cm. or more
in height. Bottles (Plate 2, C, E, G, K) are
also fairly common. Other forms include
small jars (Plate 2, H ), squat bowls ,adth outflaring rims (Plate 2, J), and carinated bowls
with convex rim standing vertically (Plates 1,
F; 2, L). Small strap handles may occur
rarely (Plate 2, H).

Coiled.
PASTE
Temper: Usually finely pulverized shell (most
of vessels sho~qa). Otherwise fine clay-grit
(Plate 1, E, F) or no tempering material
recognizable (Plate 2, B, L).
Texture: Fine compact except when shell particles have leached away leaving paste soft
and full of very small cavities.

DECORATION

Color: Commonly covered with bright, hard
red film made of po~vdered red ochre (most
of vessels shown). Otherwise shades of
brown and gray from medium to dark and
nearly black (Plates 1, B, E; 2, C, E, J, L).
Just under the red film most usual surface
co!or is buff, which shows in design lines
cut through film. Cores gray to brown.

Treatment: Engraving.
Designs: Center around semicircular motifs
usually repeated four times around vessel.
Each unit may consist of several concentric
semicircles, all plain lines, plain lines alternating with ticked lines, narrow bands with
large spurs jutting from one edge, crosshatched bands with spurs, and various combinations. A common dividing element between these units consists of two vertical
lines between which a reversed S-shaped
line is drawn, with short lines pointing toward its ends from the flanking lines (best
seen in Plate 1, I, L). Straight lines and stepfrets may be combined with curved lines.
Spirals, whorls, scrolls, circles, and negative
disks outlined by crosshatched areas are all
combined in a ~vide variety of pleasing designs. Rims of compound bowls usually bear
simple horizontal lines widely spaced but
may be plain on the one hand (Plate 1, H)
or more elaborately decorated on the other
(Plate 1, A-Aâ€™). Selected examples of shoulder designs on compound bowls are shown
in Plate 1, I-P, with N also including rim
decoration of "eyes" like those of type Bowie
Engraved (Plate 9). The very deep bowls

Surface finish: From poorly to fairly well
polished.
FORM
Wall thickness: 3 to 5 mm.

Lip: Rounded and flush with rim or turned outward slightly.
Base: Slightly convex to flat but no thicker than
side walls.
Vessel shape and size: Most common is compound bowl with low, conical bottom, large
rounded shoulder area turned in~vard, and
high rim curving outward (Plate 1, A, C-E,
G, H). Mouth diameter generally greater
than that at shoulder. Many of these are magnificent vessels, diameters ranging from 10 to
40 cm. and perhaps more. Compound bowl

(Plate 2, A, B, D) or completely angular
motifs repeated many times around vessel
(Plate 2, F, i); these are regarded as a distinct variety within the type. Red pigment
may occasionally appear in lines of dark
vessels and, in at least one case, white pigment provides contrast on a red-filmed vessel
(Plate 2, B). Usually, however, the red film
provides a strong contrast with the light buffcolored clay exposed by engraving.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Very common in McCurtain Focus, with many
vessels having both red film and shell temper.
Also a Texarkana Focus type but relatively
less frequent there and neither shell temper
nor red film used as much as in McCurtain
Focus components; moreover, some red vessels have clay-grit or no temper, and some
shell-tempered vessels lack red film. A few
vessels occur in Titus Focus components
(Plates 1, E-G; 2, B) where they appear to
be trade pieces from either the McCurtain or
the Texarkana Focus, or both. In one case
(Harris, 1953) this type appears to be associated with European trade material; otherwise it is pre-European but probably relatively late within the Fulton Aspect.

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE
Coiled.
PASTE
Temper: Often none visible; other~vise fine
clay-grit or (rarely) fine white pulverized
substance which may be bone.
Texture: Fine and compact to somewhat granular. Well fired, fairly hard.
Color: Surfaces are usually various shades of
dark brown and dark grayish-brown, ranging
to nearly black. Lighter shades of bro~vn and
gray appear, particularly with mottling due
to uneven firing. Cores are dark gray to black.
Surface finish: Exterior and interior are both
well smoothed to highly polished.

DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving and (rarely) fingernail
punetations between lines.
Designs: Confined to bowl rims. Usually there
are t~vo or three horizontal lines at the top,
below which is a zone of narrow bands arranged in rectilinear patterns. Occasionally
the patterns are compromises between rectilinear and curvilinear, as in Figures C, H, I,
M, P. The bands may be filled with crosshatching, with short dashed lines singly or
in pairs, with tiny punctations made through
the polished surface, or ~vith a row of fingernail punctations as in Figure G. Fine ticking
occurs on some lines. Design units are commonly repeated four times around rim. Many
unique combinations occur, as exemplified
by the sketches. When pigment~ is present in
lines, it is usually white, but red and green
occtlr.

FORM
Wall thickness: Extreme range from less than 2
to abont 8 ram.; average 5 ram.
Lip: Very thin and rounded; may be tnrned
outxvard slightly.
Base: On most small bowls the bottoms are
shallow and evenly convex without distinct
bases; on large earinated bmvls the base is a
disk to xvhieh the body wall is attached.
Vessel shape and size: The only definitely
known shape is the earinated bowl, in two
varieties: (1) with rim either vertical or indined outward slightly, 3 to 5 era. high, and

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Type apparently belongs exclusively to Texarkana Focus, even trade pieces being almost
unkno~vn in other loci. Relationships are
apparent in the designs (but not the vessel
forms) of Simms Engraved (Plate 71) and
Belcher Engraved (Plate 5).

of Red River in the southwestern corner of
Arkansas and the northeastern corner of
Texas in Bowie and Cass counties.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS

FORM

A Belcher Focus type, with trade pieces found
in Texarkana Focus components. Some vessels ~vere made by the easternmost Titus
Focus people. The dark colors, good polish,
and both the dashed lines and the punctations shoxv affinities ~vith Barkman Engraved
and Simms Engraved of the Texarkana
Focus.

Wall thickness: 3 to 6 ram.
Lip: Rounded, direct on most bowls, turned
outward on bottles and some bo~vls.
Base: Convex to slightly concave on bowls; convex to slightly flattened on bottles.
Vessel shape and size: Webb and Dodd (1941,
pp. 90-96, Plates 15, 16) first described the
type with 15 "sub-types" more or less equivalent to a variety of shapes. Most of these are
not now regarded as included in this type but
are assigned to others such as Hodges Engraved, Glassell Engraved, and Taylor Engraved. Plate 5 shows the range of forms now
placed in this type: most common are bottles
(C, J-M) and small bowls with rounded
bottom, narro~v shoulder bent upward and
inward at a sharp angle, and rim bent out~vard again to about same angle as body
below shoulder (B, F-I). The compound
vessel (D) is of the latter form mounted on
a globular lower chamber. A third fo~, less
common, has a rounded bottom, high sides
slanted inward, and a low rim bent out,yard
(A, E). Other forms may be added eventually. Bottles may reach a height of 25 cm.;
bowls have diameters of 10 to 28 cm.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Bossier and Belcher foci. A minor type or trade
ware in the Texarkana Focus and the most

Color: Surfaces are pale yellow, orange-yellow,
light brown, light to dark gray, etc., generally
with considerable fire-mottling. Cores are
gray to black.
Smi[ace finish: Interiors are smoothed but seldom polished; exteriors are covered with fine
ridges except in rare cases where smoothed
areas alternate with ridged areas (A, B).

When they slant across the body they contain
five lines and have short curved spurs of

of the main set (E, F ). The two outermost of
the five lines may end or curve outward toward the ends of the bands ( D, G), and there
may be border lines encircling the top of the
body (E-G). The five-line sets appear only
twice, on opposite sides of the body, so far
as has been determined. The curved lines on

to be a conical bowl although it may have
been refashioned from the lower part of a
broken jar. Size ranges from small vessels like
C and E to large jars 35 era. or more in
height (H). Soot and grease stains indicate
cooking function.

Principally a Frankston Focus type, also occurs
in the Titus Focus. Similar in general shape
and coarse paste to La I~ue Neck Banded
(Plate 47) and MaydeIls Incised ( Plate 52),
both of which are also found in Frankston
and Titus Focus components. The three types
together constitute the utility ware of the
Frankston Focus and part of that of the Titus

difficult unless rim sherds are present, for
brushed body sherds could belong to any of
them. They also account for the very high

Pulverized bone may be added to clay-grit.
Texture: Coarse but firm.
Color: Shades of brown from light to dark ~vith

Texture: Coarse but compact.
Color: Buff, light brown, gray-brown with considerable fire-mottling. Cores gray to dark
brown.
Sur[ace finish: Bowls smoothed inside, ollas not
smoothed inside; exteriors roughened by decoration.
FORM
Wall thickness: 5 to 9 ram.

Lip: Rounded, rolled outward.
Base: Flat or convex and no thicker than side
walls.
Vessel shape and size: Those illustrated are
most of the complete vessels on record. All
but A are ollas and A perhaps should not be
included; it is a large compound bowl 27 era.
high and 31 cm. across the mouth. B is 23 em.
high and 25 cm. in diameter, with a faintly
angular shoulder well below the middle. C-Câ€™
is slightly larger in the body than B but the
total height is unknown; D-Dâ€™ is taller than B
but is smaller in diameter. The two other
specimens are about the size of C-Câ€™.
DECORATION
Treatment: Brushing; possibly some incising.
Designs: B-Dâ€™ have four brushed areas on the
body, those on B and D-Dâ€™ arching up from
near the base over the shoulder and down
again, those on C-Câ€™ going in circle. Specimens not illustrated also are brushed in eir-

cles. Presumably the brushing was done with
a handful of grass while the clay was still plastic. Olla rims are rough (B) or scraped and
smoothed (D-Dâ€™). Large bowl A is brushed
horizontally on the rim and lower body, and
has an incised design poorly smoothed over
on the shoulder, repeated four times.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Found at the Clements and Hunt sites in Cass
County near Atlanta. Both sites have produeed similar ceramics and some graves have
had European trade materials. However,
most of the pottery types of the historic Glendora Focus have not appeared here, and the
vessels are mixtures of Texarkana and Titus
focus types. Assignment to any of these foei,
or to a ne,v one, awaits more field evidence.
DISTRIBUTION
So far recognized only at the Clements and
Hunt sites, Cass County.
ESTIMATED AGE
Somewhere between 1500 and 1800 A.D., perhaps historic or shortly preceding first European contacts.

and L is like G even though the cross-lines in
the scroll bands are incised, not stamped.

PASTE
Temper: Usually abundant, finely-pulverized
shell; other~vise, fine clay-grit.
Texture: Fine, firm, well-fired, does not break
easily.
Color: Dark shades of brown and gray; occasionally tan to cream. Cores gray to black.
Surface finish: Interiors smoothed to polished;
exteriors same where not ronghened by decoration.
FORM
Wall thickness: 2 to 4 ram. (thinnest pottery in
the Caddoan region).
Lip: Thin, rounded, turned outward.
Base: Alxvays convex.
Vessel shape and size: T~vo principal forms:
(1) globular jars 12 to 20 em. in maximum
diameter, ~vith short rims and mouths considerably smaller than bodies; (2) jars ~vith
very high rims flared outward so that the
mouth diameter is equal to or greater than
the body (A, D, G, J, L) and height up to 20
era. or more. The Webb collection has a triple
vessel, three small globular bowls joined at
the sides with struts of clay.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Essentially a Belcher Focus type, but occurs in
Texarkana and Mid-Ouachita loci as a minor
element. Specimen L, from the Greet Site in
the lower Arkansas River valley (Moore,
1908) may prove that the type extended into
European times. In the Caddoan area proper,
however, it is entirely pre-European. Shell
temper is far more frequent in it than in other
Belcher Focus types. An affinity with Foster
Trailed-Incised (Plate 22) is seen in the
shape of the tall-rimmed iars and in the sets
of trailed concentric circles on the body of G;
the Foster type also frequently includes shell
temper.
DISTRIBUTION
Red River valley from the Belcher Site in north~vestern Louisiana to the great bend area, extending into Bowie County, Texas; also in
components of the Mid-Ouachita Focus in
southxvestern Arkansas and at the Greer Site,
lower Arkansas River valley.
ESTIMATED AGE
!200-1500 a.n. The Greet Site specimen may
date in historic times in that area.

DECORATION
Treatment: Dentate stamping (both individual
and rocker), incising, trailing, and punetating.
Designs: Most typiea! are graceful scroll bands
repeated four times around the vessel, the
bands filled ~vith longitudinal incised lines
(C, E, M) or dentate stamps set close together across each band (F, H, I). Bodies
may also bear simple arched bands (B) or
sets of trailed concentric circles (K). The
short rims of these bo~vls ahnost always are
covered with dentate impressions placed vertically as units (E, I, K) or as rocker lines (B,
C, M). Fingernail punetations in vertical
rows on rim may substitute for stamping ( F ).
The high-rimmed jars have scroll bands filled
with dentate stamping on the rim (G) or
both rim and body (D). A few simulations
of these techniques are classified as "Cmvhide Stamped." Thus, A is like D even though
the bands are filled with simple punetations,

Texture: Coarse, lumpy, often crumbly. Temper
particles often show on surface.

DECORATION
Treatment: Incising, punctating.

Color: Light, medium, and dark brown; reddish-brown; gray-brown; rarely black.

Designs: Many variations of the scroll motif,
plus alternating rings and triangles. A circle
or ring is usually the central element, flanked
by inclined bands or paired triangles. Flanks
of inclined bands are filled with punctations
or parallel lines; circles and rings are also
filled with these but punctations and lines
may be used alternately as fillers on the same
vessels. Inclined bands may be plain or have
a bisecting line dmvn the middle to connect
the bottom of one circle with the top of the
next one. No ticking or crosshatching has
been noted. Punctations are plain, ring-like
(made with a hollow reed?), or hemiconieal
in shape. Design units are often repeated four
times (Plate 16, A, B) but repetitions up to
15 or more are also common. Plate 17 shows
further design variations with R-W on Plate
17 being "hybrid" or blendings ~vith those of
Pennington Punctated-Incised. White and
pale blue pigments are found in designs, red
ochre rarely.

Surface finish: Smoothed to polished.

FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 10 mm.; usually 5 to 6 mm.
Lip: Usua!ly plain rounded; also flat but un~videned, flat and ~videned, cambered (two
convex edges meeting in ridge), thickened
and circular in cross section (Plate 16, F),
and bent outward with a scalloped edge
(Plate 16, G).
Base: Convex and of even curvature and thickness across the bottom.
Vessel shape and size: The most frequent form
is a carinated bowl, up to 40 era. and perhaps
more across the mouth, with the rims upright
or slanted outward slightly (Plate 16, C, G,
H). Next most frequent are globular bowls
with plain, cambered, or circular lips (Plate

Temper: Abundant, coarse clay-grit and earbonized particles; occasionally some pulverized bone.
Texture: From moderately coarse to very
coarse, lumpy, and crumbly.
Color: Various shades of yellowish-brown, red
(not filmed), reddish-brown; occasionally
gray-brown to black. Cores same color as surface.
Sm~ace finish: Smoothed but not often polished.
FORM
Wall thickness.: 4 to 12 ram., average 6 to 7 mm.
Lip: Rounded or flat but not thickened.
Base: Usually convex; sometimes fiat and
thicker than the side wall but not a separate
disk to which the wall was attached.
Vessel shape and size: Most common are carinated and simple bowls ranging from 15 to
45 cm. across. Simple bowls have sides from
slightly to pronouncedly convex (B, C, G),
approaching hemispherical shape (A) ; some
have sides slightly concave or recurred (D).
Two or four rim peaks occur rarely (F). Carlhated bowl rims slant inward or outward
slightly or stand vertical (E, I). Bottles are
fairly common but are known only from
sherds (H). Also cylindrical and barrelshaped vessels similar to those in type Dunkin
Incised (Plate 19), and small jars are indicated by sherds.

Associated with the Alto and Gahagan loci of
the Gibson Aspect. Related to types Coles
Creek Incised, Greenhouse Incised, and
Hardy Incised of the Coles Creek and Troyville complexes in Louisiana (describd in
Ford, 1951), all of which have simple encircling incised lines and include cylindrical and
barrel-shaped vessels as well as simple and
hemispherical bmvls, but lack carinated
bowls and bottles. Davis Incised can also be
distinguished from them by a considerably
greater thickness of vessel walls, much
coarser and softer paste, less polish, lack of
thickened rims and incised lines on top of the
lip, reddish and reddish-brown colors, etc.
Davis Incised also lacks the very shallow bottom line and the row of punctations sometimes found on Coles Creek and Troyville
types. In the Caddoan area it is closely related to Hickory Fine Engraved (Plate 36),
the designs differing only in technique, and
to East Incised of the Haley Focus ( Plate 21 )
as discussed nnder that type.

Central eastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana, probably merging with the above-mentioned Coles Creek and Troyville types in
central Louisiana.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE

Primarily an Alto Focus type, but extending (in
jar form only) into Haley Focus components.
The above description covers only the most
definite inclusions, there being several unsolved problems (see Newell and Krieger,
1949, pp. 110-116 for discussion). Vessels
originally described as Kiam Incised by Newell were included in Dunkin by Krieger in the
above publication, but are now separate again
(Plate 45). Vessels with very closely spaced
and crudely made incised lines and crosslines, resembling brushing ( Newell and Krieger, 1949, Fig. 44, A-E ), are still of uncertain
status. Dunkin as now defined closely resembles some vessels of Pease Brushed-Incised
of the Bossier Focus (Plate 60) and the latter
may be an outgrowth of Dunkin; however, it
lacks cylindrical vessels, carinated and simple
bowls; and conversely, Dunkin lacks any evidence of applique, punctations placed in rows
to divide design panels or in fillets, brushed
surfaces between fillets, rim peaks, and handles. A relationship with Mazique Incised
of the lmver Mississippi valley (described in
Ford, 1951) may be assumed.

Coiled.

PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit; pulverized bone sometimes
added, also carbon or sand.

Texture: Coarse, ranging from compact to
crumbly.
Color: Light yellowish-bro~vn, reddish-brown,
medium brown and chocolate. Cores gray,
gray-brown, and same color as surface.
Surface finish: Poorly smoothed to fairly welt
polished, except for decorated parts.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 8 mm.
Lip: Rounded, flush with rim, rarely widened
and flat.
Base: Flat on cylindrical and barrel-shaped jars,
rarely square; convex on bowls. Of same
thickness as side wall in both eases.
Vessel shape and size: Primarily eylindieal vessels with sides straight to slightly convex, approaching barrel shape (A-C, E, G), height
from 20 to 30 em. or perhaps more. Carinated
(H, I), simple (D), and compound bowls
(F) are minor forms. The few square bases
known are on cylindrical vessels ( B, E ). Handles and applique are unknown.

DISTRIBUTION
Principally in the central part of eastern Texas
but also in southwestern Arkansas on the Red
River and in Clark County (East Mound);
not known if distribution is continuous between these areas.

Treatment: Incising and fingernail punetations.

Some part of the span 500.1000 A.D.

Designs: Sets of parallel lines in a wide variety
of straight-line patterns. Arranged in triangles, diamonds, hachures, simple parallel
lines, and grids of crossed diagonals, placed
around upper halves of cylindrical vessels, or
over whole body, around rims of earinated
bowls, and around variable parts of simple

were left entirely plain or were covered with
irregularly spaced fingernail punetations or
pinches. These body treatments provide an
easy distinction between Duren Neck Banded
and La Rue Neck Ba.nded, the latter having
bodies covered wit~t}~vertieal brushing in every known ease; Duren also lacks handles.

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE

PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit.
Texture: Very coarse and friable; large day-grit
particles commonly visible on surface.
Color:Yellow-browns, bright red (fire-color
only), shades of medium and reddish-browns,
often somewhat fire-mottled. Cores gray to
black.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
An Alto Focus type. Undoubtedly the ancestor
of La Rue Banded (Plate 47), a common type
of the Frankston Focus, found in the same
part of eastern Texas. The change from plain
or fingernail-punctated bodies in the Duren
type to brushed bodies in the La Rue type is a
general one in the utility pottery types of the
Alto and Frankston loci. The type Nash Neck
Banded (Plate 56) of the Texarkana and McCurtain loci is related to Duren and La Rue
in the basic technique of neck decoration,
but the vessels are much smaller, four rim
peaks and shell temper are common in it, and
the crimping is notably better done, ~vith
thinner coils and finer indentations.

Surface finish: Interiors are fairly well
smoothed; exteriors are rough or covered
with fingernail punetations ( C ) ; rim coils are
pinched on with the seams sho~ving (B).
FORM

Wall thickness: 4 to 12 ram., average perhaps 8
ram. Usually thickest at shoulder and base,
thinnest between these points.
Lip: Rounded and turned outward so as to
overhang the rim slightly.
Base: Thick disk to which the body wall is attached.

DISTRIBUTION

Vesse! shape and size: Jars are the only form
kno~vn (A, C) ranging in height from 14 to
over 50 em., the largest being of several gallons capacity (C). Wide shoulder area, body
tapered toward the base rather than globular,
rim vertical or slightly out-curving.

Found mainly at the Davis Site, Cherokee
County, ~vith a few sherds in other Alto Focus components. Unknown in Louisiana components.
ESTIMATED AGE
Some part of the span 500-1000 A.D.

DECORATION

Treatment: Neck banding, fingernail punetating.

Designs: A corrugated effect was produced on
the rims by crimping each coil down on the
preceding one, at regular intervals, in the
same manner as shown for type La Rue Neck
Banded (Plate 47). This technique never
shows on the body below the rim zone, although entire vessels of this and other types
were made by coiling and each coil must
have been added in the same manner. By not

PASTE
Temper: Fine clay-grit or small amount of sand.
Texture: Fine.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Belongs to the Haley Focus but probably only
to certain components such as the East
Mound in Clark County, Arkansas. A close
relative of Davis Incised (Plate 18) of the
Alto and Gahagan loci and thus are related
to certain Louisiana types in the Coles Creek
and Troyville complexes ( see Davis Incised ).
East differs from Davis in the apparent absence of carinated bowls and bottles, much
finer paste and thinner walls, red film, suspension holes, much smaller size, effigies, rim
tabs, dipping of lines under rim peaks, and
perhaps in odd shapes such as K and L. Both
have either two or four rim peaks, simple
bowls, cylindrical and barrel-shaped vessels.

Color: Tan, various shades of brown and reddish-brown. Red produced by firing temperatures on mottled surfaces (C, F) and surfaces
also sometimes red-filmed (A, D, F, J, N).
Cores brown, gray.
Surface finish: Smoothed but seldom polished.
FORM
Wall thickness: 3 to 5 mm.
Lip: Rounded and flush with rim.
Base: Usually convex on bowls, flat on other
vessels.
Vessel shape and size: Small vessels, not over
18 or 20 cm. in greatest height or diameter.
Simple bowls have convex, straight, or
slightly recurred sides standing vertical or
sloping slightly inward or outward (A, B, D,
G, H, J, M); rims may have two opposed
peaks (D, H), four peaks ( M ), two opposed
tabs built out on side of lip (J), and tabs may
or may not have small pits sunk in center. An
oval effigy bowl (E) has an animal head at
one end and a pointed tail at the other; the
two peaks of bowl H suggest a conventionalization of this effigy form. Other vessels are
cylindrical (C), barrel-shaped (F, N), barrel-shaped ~vith the broadest part below the
middle (K) or above the middle (L), and a
deep bowl like a truncated cone (I). Two opposed suspension holes in the rim are common on upright vessels (F, I, K, L, N ).

DISTRIBUTION
Southwestern Arkansas from the middle Ouaehita River to the great bend of Red River.
ESTIMATED AGE
Near the end of Gibson Aspect time, possibly
1000 A.D.

lines with punctations in the flanks (J, K).
Body designs consist mainly of concentric
circles repeated two, three, or four times
( usually four ). An applique node, often split
into three tiny lobes, usually occurs in the
center of each set of concentric circles. Other
designs consist of sets of curved lines hooked
together (H, L) and concentric semicircles
(G). Plain bodies (C) are rare.

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE
Coiled.
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit or very abundant finely-pulverized shell.
Texture: Compact, fairly fine; rather soft, friable.
Color: Light to dark browns and gray-browns;
cores generally darker than surfaces. Some
fire-mottling.
Sm~ace finish: Interiors smoothed to almost
polished; exteriors about the same in the few
undecorated areas.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
The trailed body designs bear an obvious affinity ~vith those of type Keno Trailed (Plate
44), but are simpler and the vessel shapes are
very different. The scrolls on I and K suggest
affinity with those of Cowhide Stamped
(Plate 15). Foster Trailed-Incised belongs
primarily to the Belcher and Texarkana loci,
but occurs in the Mid-Ouaehita Focus as well.
Foster and Cowhide, oddly, include most of
the shell-tempered vessels in all three of these
foei.

FORM
Wal! thickness: 4 to 7 mm.
Lip: Rounded, turned outward slightly to
sharply; outer edge sometimes notched.
Base: Usually convex; sometimes flat.
Vessel shape and size: Small jars only, height 7
to 20 cm. One of the outstanding features is
the relatively great height of the rim in proportion to the body. The globular bmvl with
short, outcurving rim (H) is an exception.
The rim may be nearly vertical ( D ) but usually it flares outxvard so that the mouth diameter is n~tably greater than that of the body.

DISTRIBUTION
Primarily in the Red River valley from the great
bend downstremn to the Belcher Site near
Shreveport; Bowie County, Texas; Little
River, Hempstead, Miller, Lafayette counties,
Arkansas.

DECORATION
Treatment: Incising, trailing (incising with a
broad, ronnd-tipped tool), punetating, and
applique.
Designs: Most common designs mâ€™e those sho~vn
in A and B, the high rim being divided into
from two to seven horizontal panels of incised
lines, usually running downward to the left
(A, B, C, F, G, L) but occasionally downward to the right or alternating in a herringbone fashion. Incised rim lines were usually
made completely across the rim first, then divided into panels ~vith trailed lines cutting
across them. In some eases there are no
trailed lines, but zones of incised diagonals
made separately (C, L). Other rim treatments include diagonals made with fingernails instead of incising (D) and horizontal
lines made of fingernail impressions end-toend (I). Some of handsomest designs inelude large open scrolls of trailed or incised

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS

FORM

Principally a Mid-Ouaehita Focus type but occurs also in the Texarkana Focus. Use of
ticked lines is somewhat like that of Means
Engraved (Plate 53 ) of the Mid-Ouaehita Focus; shape and decoration of earinated bowls
bear similarities ~vith Barkman Engraved
(Plate 4) of the Texarkana Focus.

Wall thickness: 3 to 5 mm.
Lip: Rounded and flush with rim or turned
out~vard slightly.
Base: Usually evenly convex on both bowls and
bottles, but some bowls are flat (I).
Vessel shape and size: Nearly all bowls and bottles. Carinated bowls have shallow bottoms
and high rims, usually vertical but sometimes
slanting inward or out;yard slightly; vessel F
seems to be this form with the rim slanted far
inward and the body molded into four lobes.
Simple conical boxvls (I). Small jar with
squat body and rim slanted sharply outward
( M ). A peculiar vessel shaped like a canteen
is completely closed except for a small opening at one edge (K-Kâ€™). One oval, boatshaped vessel is probably a modification of
the earinated boxvl (B). Bottles have vertical
necks and the xvidest part of the body belo~v
middle (O-R).

DISTRIBUTION

South~vestern Arkansas, especially the Ouaehita
River valley, decreasing in frequency toward
the Red River valley but extending into
Bowie County, Texas.

FULTON ASPECT EFFIGY BOWLS
(Plates 24 and 25)
This is not a type description. Effigy bowls occur throughout the Fulton Aspect area in
Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma;
they also occur in other parts of the eastern
United States. Paste characteristics and other
typological criteria of the effigy vessels
usually vary considerably from one areheological culture complex to another, the presence of animal or human representations being the principal attribute that relates the vessels to one another.
GENERAL NOTES
Plate 24: A, I, probably from Texarkana Focus
association; B, C, Titus Focus; D, F, H, J, K,
Allen Focus; E, G, Frankston Focus. Temper,
texture, color, and finish are variable, depending upou the general features of the focns to
which a specimen belongs; however, none
xvith shell temper is known in the Caddoan
area. Form quite similar, in all loci, consisting entirely of bowls shaped like truncated
cones, varying only in the steepuess of the
sides, and bearing two modeled attachments
on opposite sides of the mouth. The crenelated attachments (A, D, F, G, K) are probably highly conventionalized bird heads (the
point of A is divided like a beak). Opposite
these crenelated attachments are figurines of
animals and human beings, standing or sitting on small projecting platforms (A, D, F,
H, K), or a simple projection like a bird tail
(G). Effigies plainly of birds with prominent
heads and tails are fairly common (C), xvhile
others are conventionalized and barely recognizable (E, I ). Some bowls have two equal
attachments, symbolizing creatures whose
identity can hardly be guessed (B, J). Human heads are known on bowls in Arkansas,
facing either imvard or outward, but are very
rare in Caddoan archeology. From three to
five horizontal incised lines encircle the rim
of all bo~vls of this class; the lines are usually
smoothed over and they may or may not dip
below the two attachments. Red and white

[47]

pigments sometimes occur in these lines.
Plate 25: These vessels reflect generally more advanced craftsmanship than the simple effigy
bowls of Plate 24, and tend to be associated
xvith the elaborate ceramics of the Texarkana,
Belcher, and Mid-Ouaehita loci. A, D, E,
may be assigned to type Hodges Engraved.
The full-bodied effigies B, C, F are actually
bottles with hollow bodies and an opening in
top of the head about the same diameter as
those of ordinary bottles; they are confined to
the Mid-Ouachita Focus in Arkansas. A is a
superb example of impressionistic modeling,
the neck set at the back of the head rather
than at center, and the two sides of the face
bearing different designs; the left eye has belmv it a three-pointed "Weeping Eye" symbol (see also Plate 37, G) while the right eye
is encircled by a ticked scroll line. The effigy
]-]" is also an elaborated bottle, probably
representing a turtle; the top of the body is
decorated in the manner of pottery type Belcher Ridged (Plate 6), and a panel on each
side has a design as on bowls of type Glassell
Engraved (Plate 27). Bowl I is like those of
Plate 24 except that two small appendages at
the sides represent wings or fins. Both I and
J-]â€™ are from the Belcher Focus Complex at
the Belcher Mound, Louisiana. H is also a
bowl, but globular rather than conical, and
the turtle head is built out on the side rather
than attached to the lip; it belongs to Texarkana or McCurtain Focus. G-G" is a finely
made bottle with walls only 2 mm. thick, entirely covered with red film, found at the
Sanders Site in Lamar County (Krieger, 1946,
Fig. 16), but as it is shell-tempered and the
fragments are from the surface, it is probably
from a later occupation than that of the Sanders Focus. The frog on one side is spread
in normal swimming position; that on the
other side has the forelegs in "crawl stroke"
position. D and E are red-filmed (Moore,
1909, Plates I, VII) but no other details are
available.

no rattles (E, G-J). In one case, from the
Texarkana Focus, the nodes are in panels a!ternated with a herringbone incised design

(J).

GENERAL NOTES
Like the effigy bowls and other effigy vessels of
the Fulton Aspect (Plates 24, 25), the principle of a rattle made of pottery is also very
xvidespread, occurring in nearly every focus
of this aspect. Four knobs protrude from the
sides of small bowls, either of simple hemispherical shape ( F ) or xvith convex sides, the
mouth being smaller than the body diameter
(A-D). These knobs are hollow and each contains one or more small pebbles, producing a
harsh rattling noise when shaken. In the Texarkana and Belcher foci some of these bowls
have four long legs xvhich rest on a ring or
hollow square of clay (A, C). The bowls
themselves are entirely covered with pinchedup ridges of clay (F), tiny nodes stuck on the
surface (B, D), applique fillets (C), or
grooves made in the plastic clay (A); whatever the body decoration, it commonly covers
the four knobs as well.
Apparently wherever rattle bowls occur, similar or identical vessels are found ~vhich have

[51]

In several instances, squeezed lumps of a dense
greenish clay, or lumps of red ochre, have
been found inside rattle bowls and simple
noded bowls as well. Probably they served a
definite function in ceremonies.

Arched lines phced back-to-back vertically
provide dividing elements between panels
and bet~veen the four major units of design.
Bottles have various combinations of curved
lines and circles in which the principal diagnostic feature is the common use of very
narrow "ladders" or paralld lines with dosely-spaeed cross-lines (A-Aâ€™, B-Bâ€™, F, I ). Very
narrow hachured and crosshatched bands
are also used (C). Red pigment occurs in the

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Essentially a Belcher Focus type but also occurs
in thicker and less ~vell-made vessels in eastern components of the Titus Focus. Possibly
survives into Glendora Focus with vessels
like D and N, but more research is needed to

plique nodes or low fillets sometimes extend
part way down the body from the base of the
neck; these are polished like the vessel surface and are diffleult to see (A, B, F, I ). The
nodes may be just above the center of each
panel or on the lines separating the panels.
In one ease (F) there are t~vo such rows in
the center of each panel. Two or three horizontal lines form an upper margin to the design but the bottom is usually left open. If
the body is globular the design covers all but
the base; ~vhere an angular shoulder is present the design extends only as far downward
as the shoulder (A, G, I ). Red ochre pigment
is common in engraved lines; xvhite pigment
is occasionally seen.

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE
Coiled.
PASTE
Temper: Often none visible; also fine clay-grit
or (rarely) fine white pulverized substance
which may be bone.
Texture: Fine and compact to somewhat granular. Well fired, fairly hard.
Color: Surfaces are usually various shades of
dark bro~vn and dark grayish-bro~vn, ranging
to nearly black. Lighter shades of brown and
gray appear, particularly with mottling due
to uneven firing. Cores are dark gray to black.
Surface finish: Exterior and interior are both
well smoothed to highly polished.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Like Barkman Engraoed, this type belongs exclusively to the Texarkana Focus. The relationships in this ease, hmvever, are more ~vith
the type Friendship Engraved (Plate 23) of
the Mid-Ouaehita Focus in Arkansas, which
includes bottles with similar small nodes and
ridges just below the neck and designs of
arched lines in some eases.

FORM
Wall thickness: Range 4 to 6 ram., average 5
mill.

Lip: Thin, rounded, may be turned ontward
slightly.
Base: Some bottoms are convex and not distingnishable from the side wall; others are convex or flat but of the same thickness as the
side wall.

DISTRIBUTION
Apparently confined to a small area abont the
great bend of Red River in the southwestern
corner of Arkansas and the northeastern corner of Texas in Bmvie and Cass counties.

Vessel shape and size: Small bottles as shown,
height 12 to 25 cm., neck vertical or tapered
inward slightly, then expanded again at the
mouth. Some have an angular shoulder near
the bottom (A, G, I ). Other vessel forms may
be added to the type with further study.

DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving, punctating.
Designs: Featured principally by negative meandering scrolls which double back sharply.
The place of doubling back may be pinched
to a narrow neck from which the scroll swells
on either side (Plates 37, A; 38, C. L). The
scroll band may or may not have a ticked line
in its center; the flanks are formed by crosshatching, and blank disks of various sizes are
left within the crosshatched areas. Large circles may be used, within which is a core filled
with fine punctations made through the polished surface; a ticked ring or band may lie
between the punctated core and the outer
circle (Plates 37, A, H; 38, I). Single scroll
arms may be used without a continuous meander around the vessel (Plates 37, G, I, O;
.38, F, I). Crosshatched bands may be used
as scrolls themselves, with the spaces between
them blank (Plate 37, D, F). Bottle and jar
bodies provide the largest space and therefore the freest designs. On carinated bowl
rims the same doubled-back scrolls are
squeezed into narrow horizontal zones, but
with pleasing effect. Designs are almost always repeated four times, the exceptions being tripod bottles and effigies. Some carinated
bowl rims appear to bear eight slanting
scrolls but these are really four, each double.
Both red and white pigments appear in lines,
but cores contrast without this.

Surface finish: Fair to good polish.

flush with rim.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Principally a Mid-Ouachita Focus type but also
well established in the Belcher and Texarkana loci; occurs occasionally in the Titus
Focus either as resident or trade ware. Probably the handsomest of all Caddoan pottery,
some vessels being among the most striking
achievements of any American Indian potters. Plates 37 and 38 show the range of form
and workmanship rather than the finest
pieces; those in Plate 37 are from Arkansas,
in Plate 38 from Louisiana and Texas. Some
differences in vessel form are apparent in
these states but the scroll motif follows the
same essential principles; red film is knmvn
so far only in Texas (Plate 38, A, L). Means
Engraved (Plate 53) of the Mid-Ouachita
Focus is a closely related type and some vessels may be difficult to classify as one type or
the other ( e. g., Plate 37, D ) ; hmvever, Means
is not known as a resident type outside of
Arkansas. Hodges may at times also be confused with Natchitoches Engraved of the historic Glendora Focus, and the doubled-back
scrolls may occasionally be identical (Plate
57, A-C). The scrolls of Natchitoches are
generally more complex, their flanks being
filled with smaller scrolls; vessel forms are
distinct on the whole, running more to carlhated bowls with flaring rims; and shell temper is common in Natchitoches while absent
in Hodges. The scrolls of tlipley Engraved of
the Titus Focus (Plates 64, 65) are also similar, but simple and cruder, and vessel forms
again differ. Both Hodges and ttipIey may be
regarded as ancestors of the historic Natchitoches Engraved. The forked-eye symbol
(Plate 37, G ) is a hngerm~, element of Southern Cult" ceremonialism.

DISTRIBUTION
South~vestern Arkansas, the northwestern corner of Louisiana, and northeastern Texas as
far west as Upshur County. Not definitely reported from Oklahoma.
ESTIMATED AGE
1200-1500 A.D. Perhaps there was a continuous
development into the Natchitoches Engraved
type at about 1600 ~.D.

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE
Coiled.
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit, sometimes with added partieles of carbonized material or bone, sometimes ~vith no visible temper or a little fine
sand,
Texture: Usually fine but ranges to fairly coarse
and somewhat lumpy.
Color: Usually rich dark brown, reddish-brown,
and gray-brown ranging to black. Occasionally pale gray or even cream. Cores dark gray
or brown, occasionally with reddish or greenish tinges.
Surface finish: From ~vell smoothed to fairly
well polished except that interiors of bottles
are unsmoothed.
FORM
Wall thickness: Extreme range 3 to 9 mm., most
specimens 4 or 5 mm.
Lip: Usually rounded and flush with rim, but
greatly widened and flat lips occur on earihated and simple bowls (Plate 89, B, E, I);
thick, cambered lips (two convex surfaces
meeting in a sharp ridge) occur on a fe~v
bowls, and some earinated bowls have a sealloped flange bent outward at right angles to
the rim (Plate 39, G). Diagonal grooves
across the thickened lip and into the interior
of a vessel give a rope-like effect (Plate 39,
C,D).
Base: Convex on bowls and most bottles; flat on
some bottles and upright vessels (Plate 40,
E, F). Always of same thickness as the side
walls.
Vessel shape and size: Carinated bowls are most
common, diameter 15 to 40 cm. or more
(Plate 39, A, C, E, G; 40, A, B). Bottles are
also common, the body being small and glob[77]

ular or rounded on the upper part and the
sides straight on the lower part (Plate 40,
E, G); necks probably are always well tapered. Bottle bodies may meet necks at a
sharp angle or merge gently in a !ong curve
(not illustrated). Sherds show other bottles
with a horizontal ledge around the base of
the neck, 9, or 3 em. wide. Simple bowls up to
40 em. in diameter (Plate 39, D, I); small
jars with vertical rims (Plate 39, F); deep
bo~vls with more or less vertical rims (Plates
39, B; 40, C); and a peculiar flat bowl with a
small mouth (Plate 40, D) constitute other
forms.
DECORATION
Treatment: Very finely engraved lines set close
together; excising; lip notching.
Designs: Bowls and jars usually have the design confined to the rim or to a narrmv zone
near the top equivalent to a rim. The design
consists of fine engraved lines in sets running
alternately vertically and diagonally--i.e.,
paralle! with one another and ~vith one side
and the hypotenuse, respectively, of right
triangles formed by excising, as shown clearly
by specimens in Plate 39. A fe~v variations
may be seen, such as concentric quarter-circles in place of diagonals, a small pit being
excised at their center (Plate 39, F, H); or
sets of straight lines in three directions, parallel to all three sides of small excised triangles
(Plate 39, D). Inclined scrolls with excised
cores and longitudinal bisecting lines, similar
to those of Crockett CurviIinear Incised
(Plates 16, 17) except for the technique, are
tentatively included in the Holly type (Plate
40, D ). Bottles have a few encircling lines at
the top of the neck, the lowest line often
deeper than the others, and other such lines at
the top of the body; the remainder of the
body is covered with very fine lines in full
concentric circles or spirals, and the areas bet~veen these are filled ~vith parallel straight

(Plate 39)

lines running at different angles. The cores of
these sets of circles are excised, as are the corners of squares made around the outermost
circles. Bowl lips, greatly widened and flat,
have zigzags and meanders along the top of
the lip, formed by excising. Main design units
are repeated four times on bottles and cups
(Plate 40, E-G), but on bowls any number
fitting the space was used, from five or six
to 15 or more. Red pigment is common in
lines and excised areas; no other colors noted.

only instance of effigy work known in the
Holly type or in the whole Alto Focus complex, and probably is due to an outside influence.
DISTRIBUTION
The central part of eastern Texas is the area of
concentration, but examples have been found
west~vard to the Chupek Site on the Brazos
River in MeLennan County, in northwestern
Louisiana, and northward to the Red River
valley in Texas and southwestern Arkansas.
It may occur more widely as trade ware.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A common Alto Focus type, also occurring in
small numbers in the Gahagan Focus, both
of the Gibson Aspect. Designs closely resemble those of the Spiro Focus in eastern Oklahoma, but Holly lines are closer together, designs generally lack punctated circles in the
center of design units, and spirals are common in the Spiro type. The vessel forms (except for bottles with tapered necks) are quite
distinct in the two types (see Newell and
Krieger, 1949, pp. 200-:201 for discussion).
In the intermediate area, as around the great
bend of the Red River, it is sometimes difficult to classify vessels as specifically Holly or
Spiro Fine Engraved, particularly bottles.

excavations of Jndge Harry J. Lemley and belong to a component which is primarily Alto

is tentative and established so far mainly as
a counterpart of Maddox Engraved of the
Bossier Focus (Plate 50). The content of the
latter has been considerably confused and it
is now considered to be entirely nonshelltempered, definitely pre-European in age,
and probably belonging to an early phase
of Fulton Aspect. While the finely crosshatched bands of Hudson Engraved are
much like those of Maddox, the former is
easily distinguished by its shell temper and
different range of shapes, and it is later in
time. Vessel D has four scroll arms descending from the base of the neck, alternating
with four areas bending upward which resemble bird heads, with a blank disk in the
body and another in the position of the eye.
This conventionalized bird is very similar to
a bird design commonly portrayed on Marksvi!le pottery, but a direct relationship appears impossible; the vessel is heavily shelltempered and the shape is quite distinct from
that of Marksville vessels.

in curvilinear patterns. The hatching is exceedingly fine in some cases (A, E, F, H ) and
may be supplemented by rows of fine punctations as borderlines (E, H). Vessels B-D
have scroll bands which appear to have been
incised before firing, then the xvhole vessel

Brushed-Incised. It is suggested that such
vessels in the Maddox type should simply be
included in the Pease type (Plate 60) and
that vessels like those illustrated in Plate 43
should be assigned to Karnack Brushed-Incised. These vessels are not merely variations
of Belcher Ridged, for where they occur, the
distinctive ridging of the latter is very rare,
and vice versa. Belcher Ridged furthermore
occurs in both the Belcher and the earlier
Bossier Focus, while Karnack appears to be
confined to the Titus Focus period, contemporary with the Belcher Focus; workmanship
is much cruder and rims sho~v more variety
than those of Belcher Ridged. Webb further
notes the peculiar use of brushing in the
much earlier Tehefunete complex of Louisiana, its absence in Marksville, Troyville, and
Coles Creek, and its "reappearance" in the
Bossier Focus, various loci of the Fulton Aspect, and the Plaquemine complex in central
Louisiana.
DISTRIBUTION

Treatment: Incising, brushing.

Vicinity of Caddo Lake in Harrison and Marion

Texture: Fine, very compact.
Color: Principally shades of gray from medium

same or lighter.
Surface finish: Exteriors smoothed to polished,
over decoration as well. Interiors of bottles
(nearly the only form) not smoothed.
FORM
Wall thickness: 2 to 4 mm.

Lip: Rounded, turned outward; may be flush
on bowls.
Base: Usually convex, but flat extended base
fairly common (A, B, E, G, J, K, M ).
Vessel shape and size: Primarily bottles, many
quite large ~vith bodies up to 25 era. in diameter and short necks. Necks are usually spoolshaped and swollen in the middle, but may
be cylindrical with lip turned sharply outward (L, F). Globular bowl with two opposed lugs (F) is the only other form recognized so far.
DECORATION
Treatment: Trailing (incising broad lines with
a blunt instrument), supplemented by a little
engraving and applique.
Designs: Endless combinations of straight and
curved parallel lines fitted dose together to
cover nearly the entire body. Motifs include
scrolls, simple or doubled back on one another, spirals, guilloehes, meanders, concentric circles, and ares fitted into areas between
major units. Effigy faces created with small
applique nodes (K). Major units are usually
repeated either t~vo or four times.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Occurs in four foci: historic Glendora; prehistoric Mid-Ouachita, Texarkana, and Titus,
being the least frequent in Titus. A distinct

division is noted in the width of lines, the
narrowest and finest coming from northeastern Louisiana (A-E). Those from the Greer
Site in eastern Arkansas have broader lines
and somewhat simpler designs (F-I), which
is also true of those from southwestern Arkansas (J-L) and northeastern Texas (M).
Shell temper occurs in some specimens from
historic as well as prehistoric sites in both
northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas;
farther west, shell temper is absent. Apparently the type flourished both before and
after the earliest European contacts, but it
needs to be analyzed more in specific associations. The trailing technique seems to be related to that in type Foster Trailed-Incised
(Plate 22) of the prehistoric Belcher and
Texarkana loci.
DISTRIBUTION
Across northern Louisiana to the lower Ouachita River (Glendora and Keno sites; Moore,
1909); across southern Arkansas to the lower
Arkansas River (Douglas and Greer sites;
Moore, 1908); and westward into northeastern Texas as far as Hopkins County.

central Louisiana, differing mainly in coarser
paste and greater use of body punetating,
also jars rather than barrel-shaped vessels.

PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit; pulverized bone sometimes
added, also carbon or sand.
Texture: Coarse, ranging from compact to
crumbly.

DISTRIBUTION
Central part of eastern Texas, also occurring
sporadically in the northeastern part, and at
the Crensha~v and East Mound sites in south~vestern Arkansas. A dose comparison is
needed to determine its distribution in Louisiana in relation to Hardy Incised, Dunkin
Incised, and Coles Creek Incised, all of which
may have been misidentified in some eases
in available literature.

Color: Light yellowish-brown, reddish-brown,
medium brown and chocolate. Cores gray,
gray-brown, and same color as surface.
Surface finish: Poorly smoothed to fairly well
polished, except for decorated parts.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 10 mm., average 6 to 7 mm.
Lip: Rounded, flush with rim.

ESTIMATED AGE
Base: Disk to which body wall was attached.
Some part of the span 500-1000 A.D., but probably farther toward the end of the span than
most Alto Focus types, and may have continued to 1200 A.D., or later.

Vessel shape and size: Primarily iars with rims
vertical to everted (A, B, D, E), from only
about 10 em. high to as much 50 cm. or more;
the latter are fairly numerous and may be
regarded as storage iars. Probably some cylindrical vessels and similar ones with rims
gently outcurved (C) should be included,
although these would be distinguished from
Dunkin Incised only on the basis of designs.

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE

Duren Neck Banded (Plate 20) of the Alto
Focus, but the latter never has brushing or
applique work, the bodies being plain or covered with fingernail punetations. La Rue is
also related to Nash Neck Banded of the Texarkana and MeCurtain foei (Plate 56), but
the neck crimping is much cruder, the vessels
are much larger on the average, and shell
tempering is unknown in it. The three types
provide a special development ~vithin the
Caddoan areheologieal region, for which influence from the Puebloan culture of the
Southwest has been postulated (Krieger,
1946, pp. 237-241). In the Caddoan area,
crimping of coils is always confined to the
vessel rim.

One complete vessel (C) comes from Coleman County in the upper Colorado River
drainage.

Base: Thick disk to ~vhich body ~vall is attached.
Vessel shape and size: Jars with prominent rims
nsually meeting body at a slight angle, mouth
at least as wide as body and often wider (A,
C-F). More globular body with smaller
mouth (B) unusual. Height usually 15 to 30
em., but some vessels have a capacity of several gallons, a height of 40 era. or more and

Temper: Fine clay-grit and sand in varying proportions.
Texture: Fine to granular; compact.
Color: Basically light to dark grayish-blue, except for a thin layer of buff on the exterior
under the red film. Evidently firing the vessels after the red-ochre film was applied not
only baked the film but produced a buff color
on the original outer surface; since all the
vessels are bottles, the interiors were not exposed to as much heat and remained grayishblue like the core.
Surface finish: From well smoothed to polished
on the exterior with marks of the smoothing
too! producing a finely rippled surface in
some eases; interiors unsmoothed with original coiling seams still visible.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Sanders Focus type in Texas, not known in
other complexes. Only one sherd reported
from the Nelson Focus (Bell and Baerreis,
1951), but at least two complete vessels (H,
I) from the Adair Site in the upper Ouachita
valley in Arkansas, a component of the MidOuaehita Focus. A vessel from a grave at the
Haley Place on Red River in Arkansas
(Moore, 1912, Fig. 47) is definitely a trade
piece in the Haley Focus.

FORM
Wall thickness: 3 to 6 mm.
Lip: Rounded to somewhat flattened and flush
with side of neck; rarely turned out,yard ( G ).
Base: Convex bottoms, not notably thicker than
body wall.

DISTRIBUTION

Vessel shape and size: Bottles are the only
kno~vn form. At the Sanders Site these are
characteristically some~vhat elongated, ~vith
the greatest diameter below the middle and
necks cylindrical to somewhat tapered (AD ); heights about 15 to 24 em. From the same
site there is one complete triple bottle, the
bodies connected ~vith horizontal struts.
Those from other sites in Texas and Arkansas
(F-I) have bodies more evenly convex from
base to neck.

Frankston and Titus foei. Originally, two types
were defined, one in the Frankston Focus
components which sometimes has strap
handles and lugs, and the other in the Titus
Focus which appears never to have such appendages. They are now considered as one
type with the handles and lugs a variable
within it. The rim designs closely resemble
those of Canton Incised of the Sanders Focus
(Plate 12) but the latter type can be distinguished by its cylindrical jars and earinated
bowls, which never occur in Maydelle Incised; the Canton bodies, moreover, are always plain.

Color: Surfaces cream to buff, shades of brown

the vessel body and often wider (B, C, F, G).
Jars up to 30 era. high are common and some
as high as 50 era. are indicated by sherds;
most, ho~vever, are between 15 and 25 em.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS

Texture: Coarse but quite firm.

A Sanders Focus type in Texas. The particular
jar shape with loop handles or lugs, and the
set of the punetated lines, are distinctive and
not duplicated elsewhere, although Killough
Pinched of the Frankston Focus (Plate 46) is
similar, and most Caddoan foei have fingernail punetations of some kind.

Color: Surfaces are principally shades of brown
from tan to dark; a rich chocolate is characteristic; gray-browns also occur. There is some
fire-mottling, usually resulting in different
shades of brown. Cores are darker than surfaces, dark brown or gray to black.
FORM

DISTRIBUTION

Wall thickness: 5 to 8 ram.

The Sanders Focus area from the Red River valley in northern Lamar and Fannin counties
southward to the upper Sabine River valley
in Van Zandt County. May occur elsewhere
as trade ~vare, but it is difiqeult to distinguish
from similarly decorated pottery of other
Caddoan foei unless the shape and presence
of handles or lugs can be ascertained.

Lip: Rounded and flush with rim or turned outxvard slightly.
Base: Disk to which body wall was attached.
Vessel shape and size: So far as kno~vn, includes
only jars about 10 to 20 cm. high, rim joining
body at a shallow angle and flaring outward
slightly; body and mouth diameter are about
the same. These jars usually have two opposed loop handles, their upper ends attached
to the lip, and one or t~vo peaks rising above
the lip (B, C), or two opposed, small, solid
lugs rising slightly above the lip (A).

(Plate 56)
METHOD OF MANUFACTURE

Vertica! rows of appliqued nodes or fillets
usually occur on the rim and the upper body
of these vessels, dividing each into four segments; those on the rim are sometimes in line
~vith those on the body, sometimes equidistant between them. Appliqued chevrons occur on upper bodies (not shown). Incising as
on body of K is unusual.

Coiled.
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit or pulverized shell.
Texture: Compact, granulated; porous and soft
when shell particles have leached out.
Color: Various shades of brown, gray, and graybrown; some light yellow-brown. Mottling
due to uneven firing is common. Cores are
generally darker than surfaces.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A common type in both the MeCurtain and
Texarkana foei. Specimens ], K are from Titus
Focus components, ~vhere shell temper and
careful execution of crimping mark them as
trade pieces. Relationship with La Rue Neck
Banded (Plate 47) of the Titus and Frankston loci is obvious, but the latter type includes only large (cooking?) vessels, the
neck crimps are carelessly done, and handles,
lugs, applique, rim quadration, and shell temper are absent.

Surface finish: Interiors usually rather well
smoothed; exteriors about the same.
FORM
Wall thickness: Range 3 to 10 mm., average 5 or
6 inm.

Lip: Ronnded, bent outward slightly.
Base: Convex on small vessels, flatter on large
vessels (I-K).
Vessel shape and size: Occurs only in the form
of jars. Some bodies are squat, others are
globular or somewhat elongated. Raising of
the rim into fonr peaks is common, either
very pronouncedly (A) or with small lobes
rising from the rim (B, C, F-I). Rims bend
out~vard from slightly ( F ) to sharply (A) so
that mouths are sometimes broader than
bodies. Loop handles (C), strap handles
(H), or lugs (G), are all fairly common, always four in number. Most vessels are 10 to
:25 em. high, but the range is from 5 or 6 em.
to abont 60 em.

DISTRIBUTION

Primarily the Red River valley above the great
bend: in MeCurtain and Choctaw counties,
Oklahoma; Lamar, Red River and Bowie
counties, Texas. No neck banding of any kind
is known to be indigenous to Arkansas or
Louisiana.
ESTIMATED AGE
1400-1700 n.D. Extends into European contact
period at the Kaufman Site (Harris, 1953).

DECORATION
Treatment: Crimping of neck coils, applique,
incising, fingernail punetations.
Designs: The type is recognized chiefly by
rather careful, regular crimping of the rim
coils, giving a corrugated effect or "neck
banding." The number of coils or bands
varies from one to six with no particular number preferred. A simulation is sometimes produeed with vertically-placed fingernail punetations in unsmoothed neck coils (C, D, H).

Temper: Almost always finely pulverized shell;
otherwise none.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Confined to the Glendora Focus and an important diagnostic type for the historic
Caddo. One of the few Caddoan types with
designs on the bottoms of bowls, a trait noted
on a few specimens of Bipley Engraved
(Plate 64, K-O) of the Titus Focus. The
Ripley designs are simpler, however, and the
vessels are never shell tempered. The scrolls
of Hodges Engraved (Plates 37, 38) are on
the whole distinct hâ€™om these of Natchitoches,
as are the vessel forms, but occasionally it
would be difficult to classify a vessel as either
Hodges or Natchitoches except for the presence or absence of shell temper. The bottle
forms (A, H) show affinity with those of
type Keno Trailed (Plate 44).

Texture: Fine, compact.
Color: Buff, yellowish-brown, gray-brown. Red
film fairly common (B, Bâ€™, C) and contrasts
with lighter surface exposed by engraved
lines. Cores buff, gray.
Sur[ace finish: Fair to good polish.
FORM
Wall thickness: 2 to 4 mm.
Lip: Rounded and usually turned out,yard.
Base: Convex on bowls, somewhat flatter on
bottles.
Vessel shape and size: Principally small cafinated bowls of special form, rim being low,
slightly concave, and so attached as to make
an almost continuous recurve with body wall;
the mouths are thus considerably ~vider than
the bodies (D, F, I-K). A similar body may
occur ~vith a higher, more vertical, but still
concave rim ( G ). Animal-effigy bowl ( B, Bâ€™ )
and four-legged effigy bottle (C) are unusual
forms. Bottles ~vith large bodies and short,
spool-shaped necks are fairly common (A,
H). A peculiar platter decorated on the inner
surface has a hollow, conical pedestal base
~vith several large holes in the sides (E).

PASTE
Temper: Usually abundantly tempered with
crushed mussel shells; in rare cases no temper

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Henrietta Focus type, also occurring in the
Wylie Focus farther east, but difficult to determine whether made by Wylie Focus people or obtained by trade (Caddoan pottery
from eastern Texas also occurs in the Wylie
Focus, where it is rather dearly all trade
ware ). Similar pottery occurs in south-central
Oklahoma in the Bryan Focus (Bell and
Baerreis, 1951), where applique nodes and
fillets, as xvell as handles, are more commonly
found.

Texture: Fairly compact to crumbly; shell particles occasionally leached out, leaving a porous paste.
Color: Mainly shades of brown, gray-brmvn,
reddish-bro~vn, orange-brown, etc., but ranging from dark cream to nearly black. Not
much fire-mottling; cores about the same
color as the surface or darker.
Surface finish: Poorly smoothed and uneven,
suggesting possible use of paddle-and-anvil,
but some exterior surfaces are are fairly
smooth, satiny.

DISTRIBUTION

Vessel shape and size: Primarily small squat
bowls with rims vertical or slanted slightly
inward or outxvard (A, B, E-J). Bodies are
sometimes pushed out into four lobes (H). A
double vessel (D) consists of one such bowl
built on top of another. Also olla-like vessels
with larger, globular bodies and small
mouths (K). Carinated bowls are common,
with high rims that are slightly to pronouncedly convex (L). One small ladle-like vessel
( M ). Lugs, perforated horizontally, are present on two sides of a square bowl (C).
DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving.
Designs: Usually ticked horizontal lines around
rim; body plain (E, F, J). Concentric circles
and spirals on body, frequently combined
with t~vo horizontal lines at top and bottom
of rim; in these cases, the design unit is usually repeated three times (A, D, G, I, K, M ),
occasionally four times (H). Carinated bowl
rims egmmonly have two large arms curving

toward one another from the upper and lower
margins, each arm consisting of two, three
or four parallel lines (L). These units like,vise are usually repeated three times and are
separated by t~vo sets of arched lines placed
back-to-back. White pigment occurs commonly in the lines and ticks; red ochre is occasionally present. Bodies of earinated bowls
below the rim commonly have brushing running horizontally ( L ).
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Allen Focus exclusively. The squat bowls (A,
etc.) are similar to those of the largely prehistoric Frankston Focus type Poynor Engraved (Plate 62) except that Poynor has a
series of oval panels around the rim and has
little if any ticking. The large earinated bowls
with convex rims are again similar to those
of the Poynor type but the designs are easily
distinguished. Frank~ton Focus pottery does
not have the sandy feel of Allen Focus polished ware.
DISTRIBUTION
Small area in the upper Neches River drainage
system, principally in Cherokee, Anderson,
Henderson, and Smith counties. May occur in
Nacogdoches, Rusk, and other counties.
Wherever found, it is a "marker type" for the

may also occur in the Haley Focus and related components. The type appears to be
closely related to Haley Complicated Incised
(Plate 30), but is simpler and lacks the circles and scrolls of this type. The panels of
diagonally-placed lines are similar to Dunkin
Incised of the Alto Focus (Plate 19), but the
latter type lacks brushing, applique, and
punctating; and cylindrical vessels are unknown in the Pease type. The general arrangement of design is reminiscent of Sinner
Linear Punctated of the Bossier Focus (Plate
72).
DISTRIBUTION

FORM
Wall thickness: Extreme range 4 to 10 mm.,
average abont 6 mm.
Lip: Sharply convex to flat but not xvidened.

Extreme northeastern edge of Texas and much
of north~vestern Louisiana, extending up the
Red River valley into the southwestern corner of Arkansas and possibly farther north.

Base: Disk to xvhich wall was attached.
Vessel shape and size: Jars ~vith rims varying
considerably in height and slightly outflaring.
Oral diameter is usually less than that of the
body. Most knmvn specimens are between 12
and 24 cm. high; no very large examples or
miniatnre vessels have been noted.

ESTIMATED AGE
Precedes the Belcher and Texarkana foci of the
Fnlton Aspect; may extend from Haley Focus
time approximately to the beginning of the
Belcher Focus.

DECORATION
Treatment: Incising, brushing, applique, and
punetation in various combinations.
Designs: The entire exterior, except for the
base, is decorated. Body is divided into panels
~vith vertical appliqued fillets or rows of
punetations, or punetations made in appliqued fillets; number of panels varies from six
to 20 or more. Panels filled with brushing or
parallel incised lines are set diagonally in alternating directions producing a "herringbone" effect. Lines are often deeper at one
end than at the other. Rim decoration is
similar, except that brushing or incised lines
may run in a different direction from those
on the body. Almost always there are from
one to three rmvs of punctations around the
rim, made through brushed or incised lines.

of the cylindrical vessels. Slanting bands and
other figures may be filled either with punetations or short parallel lines, or these may be
alternated with one another and ~vith plain
areas in various combinations. The broad,
flat lips may be plain or have spaced puneration-filled triangles, or bear engraved designs like those of Holly Fine Engraved. Bebveen Crockett and Pennington an arbitrary
line was drawn, and the definitely eurvilinear
motifs were assigned to the former, the
straight-line motifs to the latter. However, a
few designs consisting of gently curved meanders, the flanks filled with punetations or
excised (F, G) cannot be easily assigned to
either type. Lines and punetations sometimes
have traces of red ochre, but more often of
a white pigment.

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE

PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit;
bone added.

occasionally

pulverized

Texture: Coarse, lumpy, often crumbly. Temper
particles often showy on surface.
Color: Light, medium, and dark brown; reddish-brown; gray-brown; rarely black.
Sm~face finish: Smoothed to polished.
FORM
Wall thickness: Range 4 to 9 mm., average 6 or
Lip: About equally divided between rounded
and flat, some of latter sloping to the exterior.
Some earinated bowls have greatly widened
flat lips, up to 21 mm. wide, most of widening
being on the inside rather than the outside
of the rim. One rim is circular in cross section
(E).

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
An Alto Focus type found in Louisiana as well
as Texas components. Occurs as trade ware as
far north as the Crenshaw Site in Miller
County, Arkansas. Closely affiliated xvith the
Crockett type in the Alto Focus, but unlike
the latter, does not extend into either the
Haley or the Spiro Focus as a resident type.
Widened lips and some vessel shapes are similar to those of the Holly type.

Base: On cylindrical vessels (C) bases are flat
except for rounding at the edge; on all bowls
they are convex and not differentiated from
the body.
Vessel shape and size: Variations of large carinated bowls are most common, diameters up
to 40 em. or more, heights up to 12 era. or
more; rims are flat to slightly convex on the
exterior and vertical to slanting some~vhat
outward, as reconstructed from sherds (A, B,
E-G, I, J ). There are a few apparently cylindrical vessels up to 20 em. or more in height
(C). Two small bowls have ~vide, shallow,
convex bottoms and high, concave rims, one
slanted inward (D), and one out,yard (H).
Appendages absent.

DISTRIBUTION
Alto Focus components in Texas from the Chupek Site near Waeo eastxvard into north~vestern and north-central Louisiana.

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE
Coiled.
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit; occasionally a few bone
particles.
Texture: Coarse but compact.
Color: Surfaces are commonly light yellowishbrown and buff, ~vith a range from cream to
dark reddish-brown. Gray spots produced by
fire-mottling were possibly done intentionally
at times. Cores are gray.
Surface finish: From poorly smoothed and
bumpy to well smoothed and at times fairly
well polished. Interiors and exteriors about
the same.
FORM
Wall thickness: Range 3 to 8 mm., average 4 to

Lip: Plain, rounded, usually flush with rim but
occasionally turned outward; notching occurs.
Base: Thick disk to which wall was attached.
Vessel shape and size: Most common form is
a bowl with rounded body and rim either ve>
tieal or somewhat everted (Plate 62, B, J)
and with the mouth diameter notably smaller
than that of the body. These bowls are from
12 to 20 em. in maximum diameter although
miniatures occur as small as 5 em. across. In
one case such a bowl has fonr long legs joined
by a day ring at their feet, as in Plate 26, A,
C, H, except that the "ring" is a rounded
square. Cmâ€™inated bowls are also common,
usually ~vith high rims which slant inward
(Plate 62, A, D-I); the rims may be quite
flat but are usually slightly to strongly convex, and the vesse! bodies also present varions
degrees of flatness and convexity between
rim and base. Boxvls such as Plate 62, C, with

rim slanted outward and body of considerably less height than the rim, are very exceptional. Carinated bowls range from 18 to as
much as 40 em. in diameter. Bottles occur
in two varieties: elongated, with short necks
hardly distinguishable from the bodies ( Plate
63, A-G); and globnlar ~vith long necks (Plate
63, H-J). The former form is unique for the
entire Caddoan areheologieal area, while the
latter is more in keeping with bottles occurring in many other types. In both groups,
heights range between 20 and 30 em.
DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving, punetating.
Designs: On bowl rims lhe most common motif
is a series of negative ovals madexvith concentric lines arched back-to-back; these may be
spaced sommvhat apart and the area between
them filled with other lines (Plates 62, A),
crosshatching or scrolls (Plate 62, C, D).
Punetated areas or small punetated circles
may occur xvithin the ovals (Plate 62, G, I ).
The bottles show a wide w~riety of motifs involving negative ovals and circles, but these
may run in vertical panels (Plate 63, A, E, F)
instead of horizontally as on the bowls. Designs are usually poorly executed, with little
contrast between surface colors and the cores
exposed by engraving; red ochre pigment appears occasionally in the lines.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
This type is the most diagnostic trait of the
Frankston Focus. It seems never to have been
manufactured in other loci, although numerous sherds have been found in central and
north-central Texas, where they appear to
have been carried as trade pieces among people who made little or no pottery of their
own. Bowls of shapes and designs similar to
those on Plate 62 have been found in graves
of the historic Allen Focus, shoxving that the
type survived until European articles reached

(Plate 62)

eastern Texas; but these are infrequent and
bottles such as those on Plate 63 have not
yet appeared in Allen Focus association. The
design on Plate 63, D, with reversed S-shaped
elements in the panels, shows influence from
the type Ripley Engraved of the Titus Focus.
Unlike Titus Focus pottery, in ~vhieh design
units are almost invariably repeated four
times, those of Poynor Engraved may be repeated only twice (Plate 62, C; Plate 63, C,
E, F, H), three times (Plate 63, A), four
times (Plate 62, G; Plate 63, D, J), or any
number up to a dozen or more. In this respect, Poynor Engraved appears to bear a relationship ~vith several Alto Focus types
which existed in the same general area at an
earlier time; in that complex, designs
(whether incised or engraved) ~vere also repeated with whatever frequency best fitted
the rim, yet in design motifs there is hardly
any resemblance between Alto and Frankston Focus.

lina River. Poynor was carried westward,
probably as trade ware, to the Colorado River
valley of central Texas and northwestward to
Dallas County or perhaps farther. Some components are known in Smith and Van Zandt
Counties in the upper Sabine River va!ley.
Despite relatively poor quality it appears to
have been the most widely traded Caddoan
pottery among tribes living west of the
Caddo.

vertical rmvs of punctations. Also broader
meandering or zigzag bands (C, D, F, G,
L, M ) and random streaks ( H, R ) ; large dots
(V, W) which may be arranged in vertical
roxvs around the upper parts of ollas. A narrow
band may cover the lip, extending do~vn the
sides a short distance (S), or a wide band
may encircle the vessel on the inside (N) or
the outside of the rim. Some interiors are
almost covered with asphaltum, probably to
xvaterproof them (U). Other smears lie
alongside of and partly over broken edges
(I, Q), indicating attempts to waterproof
cracked vessels. In rare eases, a red wash
covered at least part of the exterior surface
before the asphaltum lines xvere applied, giving a polyehrome effect (F, L).

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Roekport Focus type, closely linked with
ftockport Plain and ilockport incised, the
three types constitnting a ware which contrasts strongly with all other wares in Texas.
As yet, the origin of this ~vare has not been
traced to any particular source in other regions-that is, to other culture complexes in
the Southeast or Southwest United States, or
Middle America. The deeply striated interiors of some vessels are quite like those of
Goose Creek Plain and Goose Creek Incised
(Plate 29~ H, I), but in other respects these
types are quite unlike.
DISTRIBUTION
Central portion of the Texas Gulf Coast, particularly around Baf~n, Corpus Christi, Aransas, Copano, San Antonio, and Matagorda
bays, and extending inland as far as Goliad,
where two missions and a presidio ~vere established in the middle 18th century.
ESTIMATED AGE
From an unknown date prior to 1400 A.D. nntil
at least as late as 1750, perhaps after 1800.
At Mission Espiritu Santo, established in 1749
at Goliad, Texas, there are not only sherds of
this type xvhich must have been carried inland from the coastal bays, but a thicker pottery made at the mission and decorated with
asphaltum in exactly the same manner as on
the coast. The ware also agrees closely with
pottery made by the Karankawa in the 19th
century, as described by Gatschet (1891, p.
59). Probably several coastal tribes such as
Mariames, Copano, Coiane, etc.--as well as
the so-called "â€™Karankawaâ€™" made this pottery.

Temper: Most sherds have a fine sandy appearance with no visible tempering material.

A Rockport Focus type, closely allied to Rockport Black-on-gray and Rockpo~ Plain, but
much less common than either of them. Undecorated body sherds cannot be distinguished from those of the other t~vo types in
the present state of analysis. Detailed comparisons have not been made between the
design elements of Rockport Incised and
Goose Creek Incised, but it appears likely
that those of the former were derived from
the latter by a diffusion of ideas along the
coastal plain; neither has any close relative
elsewhere, so far as known.

the whole are probably quite distinct.

Coiled.

Treatment: Engraving.
Designs: Only very simple straight-line motifs
in a single zone around rims of carinated
boxvls, upper parts of deep bowls, interior of
rim of bowl (F), the cylindrical part of the
"goblet" (B), and the uppermost part of the
large neekless bottles (H). The designs may
consist only of parallel lines pitched in opposite directions at intervals (G), groups of
vertical lines at intervals (rim interior of F),
and a continuous series of triangles filled with
hachuring or crosshatching; such triangles
may lie point down (A-D), point up (H, I),
or in opposed pairs (E). There may be two
or three horizontal border lines above the triangles (C, D) but usually there are no borders either above or below. Design motifs are
repeated ~vhatever number of times fits the
vessel best; ~vhile four may occur (as on H),
this appears to be incidental. Red ochre pigment is commonly found in lines.

PASTE
Temper: Abundantly tempered with clay-grit,
sometimes including pulverized potsherds;
pulverized bone occasionally added. Some
bottles have sand as well as clay-grit.
Texture: Coarse but quite firm.
Color: Surfaces are principally shades of brown
from tan to dark; a rich chocolate is characteristic; gray-browns also occur. There is
some fire-mottling, usually resulting in different shades of brown. Baked red fihn occurs
on perhaps 15 per cent of the vessels, primarily bowls. Cores are darker than surfaces,
dark brown or gray to black.
Surface finish: Usually poorly to ~vell smoothed
but seldom well polished; bottle interiors are
not smoothed. Surfaces are often evenly rippled from marks of smoothing tools.

about 8 to 12 em.; rims 2 to 6 em. high (A, E,
G, I ). Peculiar deep bowls are also relatively
common, broadest near the bottom, with
slightly convex sides slanting somewhat inxvard, and xvith two small lugs on opposite
sides of the mouth jutting upward and outward from the rim (C, D). Large neekless,
gourd-shaped bottles, with heights up to 30
em. and greatest diameter somewhat beloxv
the middle (H). Engraved sherds are also
found which suggest the more ordinary bottle
forms of Caddoan loci, but none have been
restored. Unusual shapes include a small
"goblet" with a cylindrical upper part and a
small body (B), and a globular bowl with a
sharply outflaring rim ( F ). The "goblet" (B)
and all kno~vn examples of the large neekless
bottles (H) have two opposed suspension
holes not far beneath the lip.

Texture: Coarse bnt qnite firm.

A dominant type of the Sanders Focus, constituting 60 per cent or more of the total pottery,
a unique situation in Caddoan archeology,
where most foei have very little plain ~vare.
Reported also in the Nelson Focus, a mixture
of Sanders and Spiro Focus traits in southeastern Oklahoma ( Bell and Baerreis, 1951 ),
and in a "Late Component" at the Spiro Site
(Orr, 1946).

Color: Surfaces are principally shades of brown
from tan to dark; a rich chocolate is characteristic; gray-browns also occur. There is
some fire-mottling, usually resulting in different shades of brown. Baked red film occurs
on perhaps 15 per cent of the vessels, primarily bowls (D, E). Cores are darker than surfaces, dark bro~vn or gray to black.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS

PASTE

Type belongs primarily to the McCurtain and
Texarkana foci; occurs occasionally in the
Titus and perhaps the Belcher Focus, probably as trade xvare. In at least two cases it
extends into association with European trade
objects: at the Kaufman Site in Bed River
County (Harris, 1953), and as trade ware at
the Jim Allen Site in Cherokee County, type
site for the historic Allen Focus in east-central
Texas. It is present also at the Hunt and
Clements sites near Atlanta, Cass County,
where some of the graves had European objects of iron and glass beads. It is not well
known, or even definitely present, ~n the historie Glendora Focus components in Louisiana, and thus it appears to be primarily a
late prehistoric type in the Fulton Aspect,
surviving until the beginning of European
trade contacts, but not much longer.

Temper: Frequently shel! tempered; otherwise
fine clay-grit or (rarely) fine white pulverized substance which may be bone.
Texture: Fine and compact to somewhat granlar. Well fired, fairly hard.
Color: Surfaces are usually various shades of
dark brown and dark grayish-brown, ranging
to nearly black. Lighter shades of brown and
gray appear, particularly with mottling due
to uneven firing. A film of powdered red
ochre, applied after firing, occurs occasionally. Cores are dark gray to black.
Surface finish: Exterior and interior are both
well smoothed to highly polished.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 7 mm.
Lip: Thin and rounded, turned sharply upward
or outward from an inward-slanting rim.
Base: Shallow bmvls have no distinct bases, but
broad convex bottoms. The very deep nearly
cylindrical bowls (E) have flat to slightly
convex bases of about the same thickness as
the side ~valls.
Vessel shape and size: Bowls are of a peculiar
carinated form in that the rim is very narrow
and bends inward sharply, at times almost at
a right angle (C, E), and the lip turns upward or outward at a right angle to the rim.
The principal variation in form is in the depth
of the bowls, most being shallow while occasionally one is as deep as E. Maximum diameters are about 30 cm., maximum height
about 20 cm.
DECORATION

DISTRIBUTION
Primarily close to the Red River in Choctaw
and McCurtain counties, Oklahoma; Little
River, Lafayette, and Miller counties, Arkansas; and Red River, Bowie, and Cass counties,

~vith rim varying from low and everted to
high and vertical (B). Webb (1948a) ineludes small "cups."
DECORATION
Treatment: Punctating, applique.
Designs: Body and rim are almost completely
covered xvith punctations set close together in
closely spaced rows, so regular as to give the
suggestion of cord marking. Punctations apparently were made individually xvith a
round-tipped tool, although possibly they
were made in roxvs with a carved stamp at
times (C). Less often they ~vere made with
the tip of the fingernail, small and carefully
done in neat rmvs. The rows are arranged in
parallel sets, pitched at different angles and
either straight (C-E) or slightly curved (A,
B). Quadration was sometimes effected with
four single roxvs of nodes running vertically
on the body (E), or sets of fillets (D).

CULTURAL AFFIHATIONS
Principally a Bossier Focus type, possibly Haley

Focus also. Use of sets of parallel lines
pitched in different directions is somexvhat
similar to decoration of Pease Brushed-Incised, also of Bossier and possibly of the Haley Focus (Plate 60). Webb (1948a, p. 117)
states that occasionally the decorative techniques of Sinner and Pease are combined,
with regular fields roughened by linear punetations, separated by nodes, appliqued
ridges, or single rows of heavy punetations.
Some similarity in design arrangement is also
apparent with Dunkin Incised of the Alto
Focus (Plate 19) although the latter completely lacks applique and punetation. Webb
also compares Sinner with type Lake Borne
Incised of the Tehefunete period in the lower
Mississippi valley, pointing to the "startling
similarity of decoration technique and design
arrangement," even though the intervening
complexes of Marksville, Troyville, and Coles
Creek lack these features.
DISTRIBUTION
Not found in qnantity in any known site, but
occurs xvidely in central and northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas. Apparently did
not reach the Bossier or Haley Focus components in eastern Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Transitional betxveen the Gibson and Fulton

A Spiro Focus type, closely related to Holly
Fine Engraved of the Alto Focus (Plates 39,

the lines are bolder and spaced farther apart;
incising may be substituted for engraving;

Treatment: Engraving, punetating.
Designs: Featured principally by tight scrolls,
lines close together, and spirals which look
almost like eoneenhâ€™ie circles. Almost invariably the center of the scroll or spiral sho~vs
two arms hooked toward one another but
separated by a short gap (seen most dearly
in Plate 76, A). The scrolls sweep gracefully
around the vessel and sometimes are very
evenly spaced. Ticks occur on lines ( Plate 75,
E, F, H, I; Plate 76, F) and occasionMly smM1
triangles are pendant from the lines (Plate
75, B, J, P, Q). Scrolls--adjusted to the narrow horizontal space available on a earinated
bowl (Plate 75, I, L, O)--are naturally not
handled as freely as those on jar and bottle
bodies ~vith more space. In at least one case
(Plate 76, I) a bottle with tight concentric
circles has been included because the appearance is almost like that of the scrolls on
bottles K and L. In Texas and Lonisiana the
design is ,almost invariably repeated four
times; specimens from west-cenhâ€™al Arkansas
(Plate 76, H, J, K) usually repeat the design
three times, but two and four are known. An
area around the base of the neck, a square
when seen from above, may be filled with
small punctations (Plate 76, D, E, I). Both
white and red pigments appear in the lines
with some frequency.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Most commonly associated with the Titus and
Belcher foei, less frequently with Texarkana
and Mid-Ouaehita. Conceptions of what is to

75)

be included in the type have altered several
times. Webb and Dodd (1941) considered
such vessels to be one of the numerous subtypes of Belcher Engraved. Krieger (1946,
Fig. 18) labeled some vessels "Taylor Engraved" in the Titus and Belcher foei which
contrasted in several ways with tlipley Engraved on the one hand, and Belcher Engraved (as it was then restricted by Webb)
on the other. Webb (1948a) then labeled
some Belcher mound vessels as "Taylor Engraved" but he and the authors have recently
decided that this was too inclusive also as it
embraced specimens which we would now
call Hodges Engraved (Plates 37, 38) and
Glassell Engraved ( Plate 27 ). Thus, in Webb,
1948a, Plate 11, Nos. 3 and 4 would still be
regarded as Taylor Engraved but No. 5 is
clearly Hodges Engrave& and on Plate 12,
Nos. 7-11, the sherds would probably now be
called GhtsselI Engraved. Future research
xvill requfiâ€™e that a clemâ€™er distinction be made
between Taylor Engraved and what we have
called Wihler Engraved of the Titus Focus
as a new type (Plate 78). The latter does not
occur in Louisiana or Arkansas as a resident
type but it shares xvith Taylor Engrat~ed some
designs with the two hooked arms in the center of the scrolls. Webb (1948a, p. !10) reported that "Taylor Engraved" sherds are
found on the majority of Bossier Focus sites,
as xvell as in the Titus and Belcher loci, but
association of this type with the Bossier Focus should be re-examined.

Color: Various shades of brown, reddish-brown,
and brick red. The largest and thickest vessels tend to,yard yellowish-brown and reddish-brown; the smallest toward medium to
very dark brown, almost black. Cores are
darker than surfaces.
Surface finish: Many vessels covered with de,

plain areas.

Designs: The type is most easily identified by
from one to eight or nine rows of evenly
spaced arched impressions around the rim
of vessels, except in one ease where they are
on the shoulder of a compound bowl (H);
these rows of arches are alternated with horizontal incised lines in most eases but are flee
in others; impressions are usually arched upward but occasionally downward. Vessel
bodies are plain (D, E, F, H), covered with
vertical incising closely spaced (B, C),
pinched impressions running in vertical rows
( A, G), fingernail impressions placed end-toend or overlapping to make spiraling lines
(I), etc. Spiral designs are repeated four
times. Other bodies have grids of diagonal

the middle part of the Sulphur River drainage, in northeastern Texas. Specimen H, from
the Belcher Site in Caddo Parish, northwestern Louisiana, is probably a trade piece from
northeastern Texas.

Wall thickness: 4 to 7 mm.
Lip: Rounded, rolled ontward.
Basz: Disk on ollas; on bottles, flat to convex.
Vessel shape and size: Mainly bottles and small
jars. Some ollas (K).

ESTIMATED AGE
1200-1500 A.D.

DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving, excising, punetating.

REFERENCES

Designs: Scrolls, repeated four times around
vessO. Each scroll consists of two arms, one
beginning at the upper margin, the other at
the lower margin. They circle into one another, sometimes not meeting at the center
but separated by a gap (E, F, J, K, M), at
other times meeting at opposite sides of a
small circle (D, H, L). This circle may be
excised or crosshatched or have a cross in it
(D). Where the two scroll arms pass above
and belmv this drde, they are widened considerably by excising ( D, H, L). These swellings may occur even ~vhen there is no circle
joining the t~vo scroll arms (A-C, E, I, K).
Sometimes the txvo arms that hook toward
one another are plain single lines (J), ticked
lines ( M ), or narroxv crosshatched bands (G,
I). Punetated areas may appear around the

MISCELLANEOUS FULTON ASPECT
UTILITY POTTERY
(Plate 79)
GENERAL NOTES
Plate 79 attempts to provide a bare indication
of the variety of rough utility pottery which
is to be found in northeastern Texas in the
foei of the Fulton Aspect. Many hundreds
of complete vessels and thousands of sherds
collected in this area have not yet been analyzed by type, but others are described above
(see: Belcher Ilidged, Plate 6; BulIard
Brushed, Plate 11; Cass Appliqued, Plate 13;
Clements Brushed, Plate 14; Harleton Appliqued, Plate 33; Karnack Brushed-Incised,
Plate 43; Killough Pinched, Plate 46; LaIlue
Neck BanJed, Plate 47; McKhmey Plain,
Plate 49; MaydelIe Incised, Plate 52; Military
tload Incised, Plate 54; Nash Neck Banded,
Plate 56; Pease Brushed-Incised, Plate 60.
Some others, such as Cowhide Stamped and
Foster Trailed-Incised, Plates 15 and 22, often have soot on the inside, indicating use for
cooking, but are too well made to be classed
as "rough" cooking xvare).
The vessels shmvn are entirely of clay-grit temper, occasionally ~vith bone added, as is the
case with all utility wares of the Frankston,
Titus, Allen, and Bossier loci, and nearly all
of that of the Texarkana, Belcher, and MidOuaehita loci. The remaining utility xvare
of the latter loci, and most of that of McCurtain and Glendora, is tempered with pulverized shell ( see Plate 80, A-G ). The techniques
of incising, pinching, fingernail punctations,
stick punetations, applique, and brushing are

all found in various combinations, often two
or three on the same vessel, so that classification into types is quite arbitrary--much more
so than the polished and engraved wares-and will generally depend upon whichever
technique covers the greater part of the vessel surface or provides the dominant part of
the design.
The cultural associations are as follows: A, B,
Frankston Focus; C, N, probably Glendora
Focus; D-K, Titus Focus; L, M, Texarkana
Focus. These specimens do not, however,
provide even a rough indication of the variety of styles to be found in these foei.

UTILITY POTTERY
(Plate 80)
GENERAL NOTES
Specimens A-G illustrate selected utility vessels
from the Mid-Ouaehita Focus, all shell-tempered except B, G, xvhieh are clay-grit tempered. Shell-tempered vessels are infrequent
in this focus, the greater part of the utility
~vare consisting of the day tempered type
Mil~tary I~oad Incised (Plate 54). These vessels are shown for contrast ~vith those in Plate
79, which see for remarks on Fulton Aspect
utility pottery in general.
Specimens H-N r~pres~â€™nt a few selected examples of utility ~vare from the Ha!ey Focus
of the Gibson Aspect which have not been
formally analyzed by type. No shell-tempered
pottery is known in this aspect, it be!ng entirely tempered with coarse clay-grit, to
which pulverized bone was sometimes added.
While specimens H-N shoxv some consistency
in being decorated either xvith pnnetations
or vertical incised lines, not enough vessels
are available for establishing new types. For
types now recognized in various foei of the
Gibson Aspect, see tâ€™aos? described above:
Canton Incised, Plate 12; Dunkin Incised,
Plate 19;Haley Complicated Incised, Plate 30;
Kiam Incised, Plate 45; and the jars, at least,

included in Weches Fingernail Impressed,
Plate 77. On the whole, there is much less
variety of decorative technique in the Gibson
Aspect than in the Fulton Aspect; and there
is a greater tendency to use only one technique on each vessel, so that they are more
easily classified.

~ROJECTILE ]POINT TYPES

ALMAGRE
(Plate 81)
An ancient connection with the Gary type of
eastern Texas seems possible, but if so this
basic form was never used to any extent in
the large intervening area of central Texas;
both Gary and Almagre points are exceedingly rare there, and the few known specimens appear to be intrusive from both east
and west, as seen in the grade of flint used.

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Broad triangular to leaf-shaped blade
with edges fairly straight in some eases but
usually convex. Chipping is very crude, and
one edge may be straighter than the other.
Shoulders vary from weak to wide and rightangular; there are no definite barbs. Stems
are contracting and sometimes are pointed.
Bases may be convex, concave, or pointed,
but they are seldom straight because of crude
workmanship. Almagre points are usually
thick and heavy; they might be considered as
unfinished examples of Gary (Plate 99) or
Langtry (Plate 103) points, but their distribution is distinct from both of those types.
Dimensions: Total length 6 to 10 cm., average
7 or 8 cm. Maximum width is 3 to 5 cm.; thickness 0.5 to 1.5 era. While the thinnest and
smallest examples are well within the range
of "dart points," as described in other types
herein, the largest and thickest ones appear
far too heavy for such function and could
have served better as spear or lance points,
or knives.

DISTRIBUTION
See paragraph above.
ESTIMATED AGE
May have appeared earliest in southern Tamaulipas, some thousands of years before
Christ, and may have lasted longest in the
Peeos River Focus, until perhaps 500 A.D. In
the Falcon Reservoir area on the louver Rio
Grande, the type apparently is associated
with the middle post-glacial Rosita Terrace,
roughly bet~veen 3000 B.c. and the time of
Christ.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
The distribution overlaps that of Langtry and
Shumla points (Plates 103, 124). All three
types are characteristic of the Peeos River
Focus and also occur as minor types in the
Falcon Focus; the Almagre type, however,
continues as far south as southern Tamaulipas
( MaeNeish, 1958, p. 65, Plate 24, Nos. 45-48).

POGO
(Plate 82)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Large triangular to leaf-shaped blade
with considerable variation in edges from
concave to straight and convex. Shoulders
vary from square (D) to well barbed (A-C).
Stems are slightly contracting in some cases,
parallel-edged in others. Bases are straight to
convex.
Dimensions: Total length varies from about 8 to
15 cm. Stem 1/4 to 1/7 of total length. Maximum width is 4 to 7 era., usually across the
shoulders. Pogo points appear much too large
for use on atlatl darts, for in addition to large
dimensions they are thick and heavy; it is
supposed they xvere used on spears or lances,
or possibly as knives. Perhaps more than one
type is indicated, for some may be nothing
more than very large dart points.

Many of the specimens are made of novaeulite, a material found in western Arkansas
and eastern Oklahoma; others are ferruginous sandstone, flint, or chert.
DISTRIBUTION
Occurs sporadically in northeastern Texas,
never common on any one site. Also occurs
in the adjacent parts of Louisiana, Arkansas,
and Oklahoma, and perhaps more xvidely; no
comprehensive distribution study has been
made.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly from some time before Christ to early
European times.

Some are found on nonpottery sites and are prestoned to belong to the East Texas Aspect of
the Archaic Stage. Others occur on pottery
sites which appear to belong exclusively to
one or another of the Caddoan loci, from
which it is suspected that the type may have
been made until historic times, or nearly so.

ABASOLO
(Plate 83)
DISTRIBUTION

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular to leaf-shaped blade with
straight to slightly convex edges. Base is
~veakly convex to well rounded, almost semicircular, which is the chief distinction from
the closely related Tortugas points (Plate
125 ). The blade is often beveled, either along
the right or left edge of each face; in some
cases the edges are not so much beveled as
steeply chipped on both edges of one or both
faces. The base may be thinned to facilitate
hafting.
Dimensions: Length is generally about 4 to 6
era. but may range as high as 8 cm. Width is
generally 2 to 3 cm. but may range as high
as 5 cm. Very similar to Catdn points (Plate
88) but distinctly larger. Also similar to Desmuke points (Plate 91) but the base is
rounded rather than having converging
edges.

Most common in the Rio Grande valley below
Laredo and continuing into Tamaulipas,
Mexico. Becomes progressively less frequent
eastward along the Gulf coast and northward
into central Texas and the !o~ver Peeos River,
but may be expected to occur occasionally in
all parts of Texas except perhaps the extreme
north and the Panhandle.

ESTIMATED AGE
Began between 5000 and 3000 B.c. and survived
until perhaps 500 A.D. in most of the distribution area, but may have survived until the
18th century along the lower Rio Grande.

narrower than in other early, lanceolate
forms. In many cases there is a distinct inward curve below the midsection (B, E). In
other eases, there is a very faint shoulder belmv which the smoothed stem edges are quite

Shoulders are sometimes squared (G) but
usually have short barbs. The stem is usually
rectangular or slightly contracting ( B ) and is
characterized by its wedge shape; that is,
from the shoulder area, the stem is thinned
evenly to a very sharp edge at the base, with
the stem edges finely chipped. The base is
usually straight, but may be very slightly concave or convex.

(Plate 87)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Large triangular blade with edges often quite straight, but sometimes slightly convex (C, D, H) or concave (E, I). Shoulders
are occasionally small (A, B), but strong
barbs are common. Barbs grade from long,
narrow (C, G) to massive with tips in line
with stem base (F). In latter eases, the artifact was probably blocked out first as a large
triangle with convex base, then the notches
were cut imvard from base. One barb is often
longer than other. Stems are very broad and
usually expand with rather straight edges;
they may also be nearly parallel-edged (A,
C, E, I). Bases are straight to convex. The
broad stems and general straightness of both
stem and blade edges usually form an easily
recognized combination.
Dimensions: Total length about 5 to 9 or 10 cm.,
average about 7 cm. The width across shoulders or barbs ranges from 3 to 6 cm. The
maximum stem width ranges from 2.4 to 3.6

CLOVIS
(Plate 89)
(1952) has defined a Llano Complex which
is characterized by Clovis points. It remains
to be seen how far beyond the southern Great
Plains this complex is applicable. The Llano
Complex belongs to the Paleo-American
Stage herein.

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Usually a narrow leaf shape with
broadest part near midsection or somewhat
farther toward the tip. The edges are usually
convex but may be fairly straight, especially
toward the proximal (lower) end, where they
have been ground smooth. Excessive grinding at the proximal end occasionally produced recurred edges (D). Compared with
Folsom points (Plate 97), the flutes of Clovis
points are usually crudely made and seldom
reach as much as halfway from base toward
tip; E is an exception. Sometimes more than
a single blow was needed to remove the flute
( C ). Nearly all known Clovis points are fluted
but most have a longer or more even-sided
flute on one side than on the other. It is possible that some have no flutes, which would
make them very difficult to distinguish from
some Plainview points (Plate 120). As on
PIainview points, the bases are always concave and often recurved with the concavity
rounding into the basal corners.
Dimensions: Length varies from about 6 to 14
cm. on specimens from Texas, width about 2
to 4 cm. While there is no doubt that most
Clovis points are considerably larger and
heavier than Folsom points, the two types
overlap somewhat in size. Ho~vever, the thinness of FoIsom points makes them lighter;
their flutes extend nearly to the tip in most
cases, they often have a small nipple in the
middle of the basal concavity which is never
seen in Clovis points, and the distribution and
geological association of the two types are
quite distinct.

DISTRIBUTION
From the Borax Lake Site in northern California and the Lehner and Naco sites in
southern Arizona across the United States to
the Atlantic seaboard; a few specimens from
Alaska, Durango, Mexico, and Costa Rica.
Examples are known from most parts of
Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Somewhat greater than that of Folsom points,
probably at least 10,000 B.C. and perhaps as
early as 15,000 B.c. Excavated specimens in
the Great Plains and Arizona are repeatedly
associated ~vith extinct mammoths, animals
which did not certainly survive until Folsom
times.

(Plate 91)
DESCRIPTION

DISTRIBUTION

Outline: Small, shoulderless, roughly lozengeshaped points. Blade edges are straight to
convex; base contracts more or less to a point
rather than being convex to semicircular as in
the case of Abasolo points (Plate 83). Edges
of base tend to be straight, or one edge fairly
straight while the other may be convex; base
and blade frequently meet at a distinct angle.
Blades are sometimes beveled along either
the right or left edge of both faces, but not as
frequently as in the AbasoIo type.

Apparently most frequent along the middle
parts of the Frio and Nueces River valleys,
decreasing southward toward the lower Rio
Grande, and toward the coast in Nueces and
Kleberg counties. Not recognized as yet along
the rest of the Texas coast or in central Texas.
Many specimens are made of a ~vhite quartzite found in Duval, MeMullen, and probably
other adjacent counties; elsewhere, made of
various flints.
ESTIMATED AGE

Dimensions: Total length 3 to 5 cm., average
about 4 cm. Maximum ~vidth 1.5 to 2.5 cm.
Cross section may be thick and diamondshaped with a ridge on each face.

Not determined.

belonging to the Falcon or Mier Focus, or
both, but most frequent in the interior where

EDGEWOOD
(Plate 92)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Short triangular blade with edges
sometimes straight, usually convex. Blade is
occasionally beveled on the right edge of both
faces. Shoulders are prominent to well
barbed. Stem edges expand ~videly with the
base often as xvide as the shoulders. Base
may be nearly straight (F) but is usually
concave.
Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 5 em., average about 4 era. Maximum width 2 to 3 era.
Stem width usually 1.5 to 2 era. and stem usually 1/3 to 1/2 total length.
CULTUI:~AL AFFILIATIONS
Not common in any kno~vn complex but occurs
xvith some consistency in components of tl:e
East Texas Aspect, Archaic Stage, and to a
lesser extent in the Edxvards Plateau Aspect.
Edgetvood points resemble Ellis points (Plate
94) in size and proportions, differing mainly
in their concave bases. As the txvo types appear to have about the same distribution in
time and space, it may be argued that they
should be combined into one. Edgewood
points also resemble three larger Edwards
Plateau Aspect types: Fairland, Frio, and
Martindale (Plates 96, 98, 107) in some re-

speets and some of those on Plate 92 perhaps
belong to these types. In general, Edgewood
points are smaller and broader in proportion
to length than the above central Texas types,
and lack basal notching.
DISTRIBUTION

Principally found in northeastern Texas, and
sporadically from there toward central and
north-central Texas, perhaps also toward the
coastal plain.
ESTIMATED AGE
Probably late in the Archaic Stage, appearing
shortly before or after the time of Christ.

Ellis.
DISTRIBUTION
Apparently most common in the Dallas area,
fading out in northeastern Texas, but not
known in any notable numbers anywhere.
ESTIMATED AGE

Dimensions: Total length about 2 to 3.6 era.,
average 2.5 to 3 cna. Stem is usually about
half the total length, sometimes a little more
or less. Small size may indicate use as arrmv
points, but thickness and ~vorkmanship compare with other dart point types.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Characteristic of the Elam Focus, Archaic
Stage; also occurring as a minor type in the
East Texas Aspect. Some overlapping with
Ellis points, but shoulders are generally less
well developed, stem and blade are more
equal in size, stem edges do not expand as

500 ~.c. to 450 A.O. (Crook and Harris, 1952).

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Short triangular blade with edges
straight to convex, occasionally slightly concave.

Shoulders

are

prominent

to

well

barbed. Stem expands toward base but is
never as broad as shoulders; stem edges tend
to be straighter than in most types with cutout corners. Bases are straight to convex.

Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 5 cm.
Maximum width across shoulders about 2 to
3 cm., smaller specimens (A-C) may have
been rechipped. Stems equal 1/4 to 1/2 of
total length and are 1.5 cm. wide.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Widely distributed in the Archaic Stage, more
or less throughout Texas except for the southwestern section and possibly the upper Panhandle. Never nmnerous in any particular
area but may be of greatest relative frequency in the East Texas Aspect. In eastern
Texas, the type survived into association with
pottery in the Alto Focus of the Neo-American Stage (Newell and Krieger, 1949, pp.
166-167). Survival into pottery association
is possible but not proved in other areas. Although similar in size and proportions to
Edgewood points (Plate 9:29), Ellis appears
to have a much wider distribution and may
have lasted somewhat later. An extended

study would probably show this type to be
very widespread in the eastern United States
in late Archaic and early Woodland cultural
associations, like Gary points (Plate 99), but
less frequent.
DISTRIBUTION

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Blade triangular and varying considerably in length and width; edges are often
quite straight, otherwise slightly convex, occasionally finely serrated. Shoulders vary
from slight to pronounced; barbs, if present,
are short. Sterns are very broad across neck,
due to notches being shallow, and bases are
commonly wider than shoulders so that basal
corners are in line with blade edges. Occasionally the base is less wide than the shoulders but shallow notches and broad stem
neck suggest the Ensor type. Bases are most
commonly straight but may be concave (C,

DISTRIBUTION

Great Plains from south-central Canada to central Texas, including eastern and central New
Mexieo, and extending almost to the Gulf
coast of Texas. Much more restricted in distribution than Clovis points, although due to
the fact that the latter have often been called
"Folsomoid," "Folsomlike," and "Generalized
Folsom" points, this important difference in
distribution has usually been obscured in
the literature.
ESTIMATED AGE
Approximately 8000 s.c., based on a radiocarbon date of 9883 -+ 300 years ago, obtained
from bison bone in the Folsom level of the
Lubbock, Texas, City Reservoir Site (Sellards, 1952). Apparently Folsom points had
given wav to other types by approximately
7000 B.C.

DESCRIPTION

and the larger, crudely chipped ones closely
resemble Almagre points (Plate 81 ), both of
which occur in the Pecos River Focus and
down the Rio Grande to the Falcon area.
However, none of the three types (Gary,
Langtry, Almagre) occurs as an established
type in the large intervening area of central
Texas to provide a historical connecting link.
On the other hand, all three should be on
approximately the same time level in eastern
and western Texas, and they may have been
historically connected at one time, never
gaining any favor in the central area where
so many other styles were common.

Outline: Triangular blade with edges usually
straight to convex but sometimes concave or
reeurved ( B, H ). Shoulders may be small but
usually flare out widely almost at right angles; barbs, if present at all, are short. Stems
usually contract strongly to a pointed or
somexvhat rounded base but may at times
approach being parallel-sided.
Dimensions: Total length about 4 to S cm., occasionally a little shorter or longer. Maximum
width across shoulders 2 to 5 era. Stems are
more constant in length than blades, so that
on shorter specimens (B, C) the stems are
about 1/2 the total length, on longer ones 1/3
to 1/4.

ESTIMATED AGE (Texas only)
Possibly 2000 ~.c. to 1000 A.D. for the most part,
then possibly being retained in some loci as
late as 1500 or 1600 A.~. They are consistently
collected on the same sites with Caddoan
pottery types, but specific data on association is lacking except in the Alto Focus.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Common in East Texas Aspect, Archaic Stage,
surviving into association with pottery in the
Alto Focus and possibly other foei of both
the Gibson and Fulton aspects, Neo-American Stage, in the Caddoan area. May have
survived ahnost to the Historic Stage in some
localities in the Caddoan area (e.g., in the
McCurtain Focus). Also occurs very xvidely
in the eastern United States in the Archaic
Stage and in the early Woodland period with
pottery, even more widely than do Ellis
points. Wells points (Plate 129) resemble
Gary but are narrower in proportion to
length, the stems are consistently about ~ the
total length and are usually well smoothed,
and Wells points are of much more limited
distribution, being apparently confined to
eastern, central and the eastern end of northcenhâ€™al Texas. The smaller Gary points some~vhat resemble Langtry points (Plate 103)

Dimensions: Length 4.5 to 11 cm., maximum
width about :29 to 3.5 em. However, it is quite
possible that the longest and broadest specimens (or even all of them) are knives rather
than projectile points; but it is probable that
some were used as projectile points, particularly those of symmetrical outline with
thinned, concave bases (such as E), and
these grade imperceptibly into larger and
heavier specimens which are probably knives
(D, F). It seems better to illustrate the range
than to attempt at this time to decide which
should be called knives.

be straight or (rarely) convex. Possibly more
than one type is represented, but features intergrade so that separation is difficult.
Dimensions: Total length about 4 to 7 em., average about 6 cm. Maximum width across
shoulders about 2.2 to 4 cm. Base 0.6 to 1.6
era. xvide. Stem often 1/2 total length but
ranges to 1/4.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A common type of the Pecos River Focus and,
with Shumla points (Plate 19.4), diagnostic
of that focus. Extends down the Rio Grande
valley as a minor type in the Falcon Focus;
occurs rarely in the Edwards Plateau Aspect
but it is uncertain whether they were made
there or are intrusive from the Pecos River
Focus. Some larger, thicker, and considerably
heavier specimens designated as a "crude variety" of the Langtry type have here been
placed in the Almagre type ( Plate 81 ), which
has a distinct distribution. Certain Langtry
points with contracting stems and convex

bases closely resemble some Gary points
(Plate 99) of eastern Texas, but a firm connecting link through central Texas is lacking
(see discussion under Gary points).
DISTRIBUTION
Apparently centered in the Pecos River-Rio
Grande confluence area, extending over adjacent parts of Trans-Pecos Texas and northern Coahuila in the general Big Bend Area,
and southeastward down the Nueces and Rio
Grande valleys about as far as McMullen
and Start counties, respectively. Also occurs
in the Tamaulipas panhandle next to the Rio
Grande valley.
ESTIMATED AGE
An unknown time before Christ to 700 or 800
A.D.

DESCRIPTION

Outline: Usually long, slender, double-pointed,
leaf-shaped blade, althongh one end may be
somewhat more rounded than pointed (D).
Some of the broader ones may be doublepointed knives. However, for the most part
their thickness and steep edges make them
unsuitable for knives and their symmetry
snggests the balance needed for projectile
points. They are thickest in the middle and
thinned down enough at one end to be hafted.
Dimensions: Length 5.5 to 10 cm., most being
6 or 7 cm. Maximnm width 2 to 3 cm., at middle or close to it.

Western part of central Texas to the Peeos
River mouth, southward to the central coast
and south~vestern Texas, and south of the Rio
Grande to southern Tamaulipas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly appeared earliest in southern Tamaulipas, several thousand years before the Christian era; in Texas from well before the time
of Christ to somexvhat after.

DESCRIPTION

the massive squared barbs of the latter are
absent. As with most types, individual specimens are often difficult to assign to one type
or another with complete confidence.

Outline: Generally broad triangular blade with
edges straight, slightly convex, or gently recurved. Always barbed because of deep
notches cut into the corners at about a 45
degree angle; barb tips sometimes in line
with base (D, E). Angle of notches always
makes stem strongly expanding; bases
straight to convex, rarely slightly concave,
generally not as wide as barbs.

DISTRIBUTION
Approximately from the lower Peeos River valley across central Texas to the middle Brazos
River, and from the Possum Kingdom Reservoir area on the upper Brazos southward to
the central portion of the coast.

Dimensions: Total length 4.5 to 10 era., average
5 or 6 era. Maximum ~vidth across barbs
about 3 to 4.5 em. Stem base about 2
to 3 em. wide and stem rather consistently
about 1 em. long, thus 1/5 to 1/9 of total
length.

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade ~vith edges sometimes straight, usually convex. Shoulders pronounced to well-barbed, but barbs seldom
reach to base. Stem varies from nearly parallel-edged (D, G) to strongly expanding. The
most distinguishing feature of these points is
that the base is formed by two distinct convex curves meeting in a depression in the
center, a "fish-tail" best seen in specimens C,
D, E, G, I. On other specimens the base appears to be a simple recurve, but dose examination sho~vs the double-convex "fishtail." It is assumed that this form of base was
the result of deliberate effort setting it apart
from other bases.

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Same as Tortugas points (Plate 125)

right or left edge of both faces, occasionally
on both edges of one or both faces.
Dimensions: Smaller than Tortugas points,
ranging from 2 to 4 cm. in length and 1.5 to
2.5 cm. in width. In length and width these
could be classed as arrow points, but in
thickness and the use of bevels they are like
other dart points. Between 4 and 4.5 cm. in
length, they overlap the smallest Tortugas
points.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Linked with Catdn points (Plate 88) as diagnostic types of the Mier Focus, Archaic Stage,
in sonthwestern Texas. The two types are
small counterparts of the Tortugas and Aba,solo types, respectively, and where stratigraphic data have been reported, they appear in later periods than the two larger
types. In Tamaulipas and on the Texas coast,
Matamoros and Catdn points occur in association with pottery whereas their larger

counterparts are prepottery. Tortugas and
Abasolo points occur far inland in Texas, but
the two smaller types do not, as far as known.
DISTRIBUTION
From southern Tamaulipas to the central Gulf
coast of Texas, inland over southwestern
Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
May have first appeared about 500 ~,.D. and (at
least in the Brownville, Rockport, and Mier

early or transitional Archaic; perhaps some
part of the span 7,000 to 4,000 B.c. In Nebraska some are as old as Plainview points
(Davis, 1953), showing that the principle of
beveling ~vas known in the Paleo-American
Stage, at least in Nebraska. Beveling ~vas not
widespread, however, until the Archai~
Stage.

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Lanceolate with alternate bevels or
pronounced marginal chipping along the lateral edges of the blade. The laterally
smoothed stems may grade almost imperceptibly into the blade (D), or be noticeably wider than the blade (B, E, H). Edges
of the stem are parallel (D), slightly expanded ( B, F ), or slightly contracted (A, E ).
Bases are always concave, but the concavities
range from slight (B) to pronounced (H).
Blades are usually beveled to the right (A-C,
F-H) and are often serrated (D-F, H).

REMARKS
Because the bases of Meserve points are quite
similar to the bases of Plainview points, it has
been suggested (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks,
1954, p. 450) that most or all Meserve may
be rechipped Plainview points; the rechipping could have been done either by peoples
who made the Plainview points or by later
peoples. For a number of reasons, it appears
to the present authors, however, that most
Meserve points--especially those with carefully beveled blades--were made in the
Mesert~e shape from the start. A careful comparison of the workmanship, form, and distribution of Meserve and Plainview is needed
to clarify this question. Perhaps such a study
will demonstrate that there are txvo types
represented in the present definition: ( 1 ) reworked Plainview points, and (2) points initially made with Plainview-like bases and beveled blades.

Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 9 cm. Stem
length (2 to 3 cm.) is less variable than the
blade length. Maxinmm ~vidth is about 2 to
2.7 cm.
Workmanship: Generally good, with careful attention to detail. Beveled blade edges were
formed by the removal of deep narrow flakes,
producing a serrated effect along the edges.
The bases were thinned by the removal of
several long, thin, narrow flakes.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Most specimens from Texas are surface finds;
most of those recovered from excavations
have been found in Archaic components, especially the Ed~vards Plateau and East Texas
aspects. Whether they were actually made by
Archaic peoples is uncertain, as it is possible
that the fe~v Meservo. points which have been
found at any one site could have been picked
up from earlier sites by Archaic peoples.
Typologically, Meserve points closely resemble Plainview points, but the latter lack beveled blades and steep marginal chipping. The
serrated form is sometimes referred to as the
Dalton type (Wormington, 1957, p. 114).

the center ~vith a deep V-shaped notch. The
notch may occasionally be somewhat
rounded, but this clear bifurcation of the stem
is an easily recognizable feature. The base

barbs, if present, are very small. Stems are
either parallel-edged with convex base or
somewhat contracted with straight to convex
base. In general, the stem is very broad and
rounded with the blade not greatly wider.
Dimensions: Total length about 5 to 9 cm., average 7 to 8 cm. Maximum ~vidth across shoulders about 2.5 to 4 cm. Maximum stem width
about 1.8 to 2.5 cm.; stems 1/3 to 1/5 of the

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A minor type in a complex not yet well defined,
for which the Morhiss Site in Victoria County
is the principal known component. This site
has numerous chipped-stone artifact types of
both the Aransas Focus and the Edwards
Plateau Aspect, Archaic Stage, which is expected because of its position near the boundary between central Texas and the Coastal

Plain. The Morhiss type, however, appears
to be a rather local development ~vhich is

DISTRIBUTION
Primarily in the central part of eastern Texas,
possibly occurring rarely in the remainder of

blade so strongly that it is more like a propeller in cross section than the ordinary edgebevel; that is, the twist begins along the centerline of the blade rather than near the edge.
Stems are also beveled, but in an opposite
direction from the blade, so that the artifact
has a peculiar cork-screw t*vist, the purpose
of which is unknown. The photographs fail
to show this adequately. Stems are variable,
from parallel-edged to somewhat expanded
or contracted, and bases are straight, concave, or convex.

Dimensions: Total length about 3.5 to 9 cm.
most between 5 and 7 cm. Maximum width
across shoulders or middle of blade is about
1.5 to 3 cm. Stems are 1 to 1.5 cm. wide and
1/3 to 1/7 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Belongs primarily to the Pecos River Focus,
extending rarely into the Edwards Plateau
Aspect. In general, the outline of the stem
and blade is similar to the Nolan type (Plate
113), but Nolan lacks beveled blades. In out-

line it is also somewhat similar to the Travis
type (Plate 126), which lacks the combination of twisted blade and beveled stem.
While the blades of many types will sometimes be twisted because the original flint
flake was not very well flattened by chipping,
Pandale points were made to twist by chipping them that way.
DISTRIBUTION
Appears centered in the Pecos-Rio Grande confluence area, decreasing toward central
Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 B.C. to 700 or 800 A.D.

PANDALE

(Plate 116)

PANDORA
(Plate 117)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular to leaf-shaped blade, edges
almost straight in a few cases but usually
convex. On longer and narro~ver specimens
the edges may be almost parallel from 1/2 to
3/4 the distance forward. By definition, the
bases are straight or nearly so, which distinguishes them from Kinney points ( Plate 101 )
with concave bases and Refugio points (Plate
121) ~vith strongly convex bases. Rarely the
basal edges are faintly smoothed.
Dimensions: Length about 4.5 to 12 cm., maximum ~vidth about 2 to 3 cm. However, it is
quite possible that the longest and broadest
specimens (or even all of them) are knives
rather than projectile points, but there appears to be no definite way of distinguishing
them. It seems possible that at least some of
the Pandora were used as projectile points,
particularly those of narrow, symmetrical
outline with thinned bases. The gradation
into broader specimens ~vhich are more
likely to be knives is constant, and probably
individuals will differ in their opinions as to
which should be called projectile points and
which knives.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Uncertain at present, but a minor type, at least,

in the Edwards Plateau Aspect and the Carrollton Focus of the Archaic Stage.
DISTRIBUTION
Most common in that portion of Texas where
the central and coastal areas meet, in Victoria, Refugio, and neighboring counties. Occurs infrequently in central, north-central,
and the eastern side of Trans-Pecos Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 B.c. to 1000 A.D., but may be older
or younger.

(Plate 120)
DESCRIPTION

DISTRIBUTION

Outline: Basically lanceolate with edges more
or less parallel for 1/2 to 3/4 the distance
from base to tip, a form best illustrated by the
most nearly complete specimens from the
type site at Plainview in the Texas Panhandle
(D-F, I). Variations in form consist of a
slight expansion in the middle (H) and a
gentle recurve of the lower edges (E, F).
Grinding of basal edges almost alvcays occurs. Flaking scars sometimes run parallel
across the faces or are roughly matched in
pairs (A, D, F-I); usually they are irregular.
Bases are always concave in some degree,
from shallow (A) to a deep recurve ( H ).
Dimensions: Length about 4.5 to 8 cm., maximum width about 1.8 t6 2.8 cm. Base width
is almost always between 2 and 2.6 cm., although slightly narrower or broader ones
occur. The concavity in the base is i to 8 mm.
in depth.

Occurs practically throughout Texas although
never frequent in any site or area; the same
may be said for its distribution throughout
the Great Plains into south-central Canada.
Specimens are known from Alaska and from
northeastern Mexico; also from Arizona, New
Mexico, and from such states as Louisiana,
Arkansas, Missouri, and others farther east.
Comparable to the distribution of Clovis
fluted points (Plate 89), covering the greater
part of North America; and the shape is
much like that of Clovis points except for the
absence of fluting.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 7000 B.C. to 4000 B.C.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Found unmixed with other projectile point
types at the Plainview Site, where it is associated with side and end scrapers, and extinct species of bison. In the Red Smoke Site,
Nebraska, it is apparently associated with
Meserve points (Davis, 1953). Elsewhere, it
is sometimes found with ScottsbIuff, Eden,
and Meserve points, suggesting an early postglacial age. Many examples have been found
in sites of the Archaic Stage in Texas, especially the Edwards Plateau Aspect, the Carrollton Focus, and the East Texas Aspect, but
it is uncertain whether or not PIainview
points were actually made by these peoples.

REFUGIO
(Plate 121)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Long and slender blade, triangular to
leaf-shaped; edges usually convex, occasionally nearly straight, and sometimes brought
to a long, needle-like tip (A, C ). On the narrowest specimens, the edges may be nearly
parallel for some distance (A, C, E). The
bases are convex to semicircular, which distinguishes them from Kinney points (Plate
101 ) with concave bases and Pandora points
(Plate 117) with straight bases. Most of the
body is usually quite thick with a ridge on
each face (best seen in C), but the lower
1/3 or so is noticeably thinned down to facilitate hafting. Thus, although no real shoulders are present, most of these artifacts have
what amounts to a stem section set off from
the blade; in this respect they also differ from
Kinney and Pandora points. Black asphaltum
stains sometimes occur on this stem section
on specimens near the coast (D), indicating
the use of asphaltum in cementing the haft.
Dimensions: Length about 6 to 10 cm., seldom
more or less. Maximum width 2 to 3 cm. As
with Kinney and Pandora points, it may be
argued that some of these specimens are
knives.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A minor type in various Archaic complexes:

Pecos River Focus, Carrollton Focus, Falcon
Focus, and Edwards Plateau Aspect. Probably closely related to Lerma points (Plate
104) as well as Kinney and Pandora.
DISTRIBUTION
Found widely in the central coastal area, southwestern, central, and north-central areas, and
the lower Pecos River. Perhaps most frequent on the central coast.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 s.c. to 1000 A.D.

SAN PATRICE
(Plate 122)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade, often stubby, with
edges straight, convex, or concave; occasionally, the blade is leaf-shaped (G, H). Shoulders are weak and often absent. The blade is
sometimes beveled on the right or left edge
of both faces but more often all four edges
appear steep because of the removal of the
center of the stem and blade by thinning or
fluting. Stem edges are sometimes cut inward
with notches (E, G), otherwise they are parallel or somewhat contracted. Some stem
edges are concave (A-D, F, H, I). Bases are
always concave, often deeply.
Dimensions: Total length about 2 to 5 era.,
average about 3.5 cm. Maximum width across
shoulders about 2 to 3.2 cm. Flutes 1/3 to 2/3
of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Occur in an undefined Archaic complex in
northwestern Louisiana and in the East Texas
Aspect, but they are rare in the latter. It is
unlikely that these points have been rechipped since most appear completely original in form, particularly those with notchedin stems. There is an interesting possibility
that the fluting principle survived much

longer in this area than elsewhere. There is
some resemblance to Paisano points (Plate
114) but these are never smoothed or fluted
and there is no known connecting link across
the several hundred miles of central Texas.
DISTRIBUTION
Northwestern Louisiana, northeastern Texas,
eastern Oklahoma; probably Arkansas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Preceramic, otherwise uncertain.

SCOTTSBLUFF
(Plate 123)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular to leaf-shaped blade, edges
straight to convex. The edges are sometimes
parallel for at least half the length of the
blade (B, D, F). Shoulders are small but
definitely cut inward at right angles to the
blade, or slanting forward slightly; barbs are
absent. The stem is essentially rectangular
but the edges may expand a little (A, C).
The base is usually quite straight but may be
very slightly concave (C) or convex (A).
Stem edges are commonly ground smooth.
Blade faces are often chipped with parallel
scars running across (D-F), or with matched
pairs of scars meeting in a central ridge (B).
Whether regularly or irregularly chipped,
Scottsbluff points ordinarily have a "fat" feel
because they are thick and oval in cross section; a few are thin and fiat (C).
Dimensions: Total length about 5 to 15 cm.
Maximum width is usually 2.5 to 3.5 cm.; narrow specimens such as B are very unusual.
Stems vary from 2 to 3 cm. in width and 1.2
to 2.5 cm. in length. Stems are thus from
about 1/3 to 1/10 or less of the total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Like Plainview points, the Scottsbluff type is
found widely in the Great Plains region,
sometimes in association with extinct species
of bison and in geological circumstances
~vhich indicate an early post-glacial age. The
largest series of points from individual sites
are those from the Eden Valley in western
Wyoming (Moss, et al., 1951) and the Sage
Creek or Horner Site near Cody, Wyoming
(unpublished). Other such associations occur in Nebraska (Davis, 1953). In Texas vir-

tually no Scottsbluff points have been found
in place, most specimens having been picked
up from the surface.
DISTRIBUTION
Found primarily, if not exclusively, in the eastem half of the state, especially in the general
area of the Sulphur and upper Sabine River
systems, where about half the known specimens in Texas have been found. They also
occur in northern Louisiana and Arkansas
and probably more widely in the eastern
United States, as well as throughout the
Great Plains from Texas and New Mexico to
south-central Canada.
ESTIMATED AGE
6000 or 7000 B.C. to 4000 B.C., but it is di~cult
to estimate the upper limits until the type
has been adequtely studied in distribution
and association.

may be allowed but pronounced convexity
would place similar specimens in the AbasoIo

or sometimes large flakes giving an effect like
fluting.

REFERENCES
Kelley (1947a), refers to "Baird Beveled Blade"
and "Taylor Thinned Base" points in connection with the Edwards Plateau Aspect, while
in southwestern Texas he referred to a third
type, "Tortugas Triangular Blade" (1947a, p.
104). The present authors have grouped all
of these forms into a single type. The name
Tortugas is used for this type, since it was
coined for southwestern Texas, ~vhere this
form is very common and it includes all the
variations of the "Baird" and "Taylor" groups
found in central Texas. The specimens called
"Baird Beveled Blade" and "Taylor Thinned
Base" at the Davis Site in eastern Texas
(Newell and Krieger, 1949, pp. 168-170, Fig.

Dimensions: Length about 3.5 to 8 cm., maximum ~vidth about 2 to 4 cm., but the majority
are of fairly uniform size. The smallest ones

(Plate 108 ).
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type, with Abasolo points, of the Falcon Focus, continuing into the Mier Focus
along ~vith their two smaller counterparts,
Matamoros and Catdn points. Occurs as a
minor type in the Aransas Focus, the Edwards Plateau Aspect, and the Pecos River
Focus, all of the Archaic Stage. Apparently
occurs in association xvith pottery in the NeoAmerican Stage only in the Alto Focus in
eastern Texas; however, it occurs only very
rarely if at all in the Archaic Stage of eastern
Texas.

smoothing. Travis points closely resemble
Nolan points (Plate 113) in outline but lack
beveled stems. They are also narrower and
have much less prominent shoulders and
barbs than Lange points (Plate 102).

Outline: Slender triangular to leaf-shaped

rounded. The stem is usually rectangular with
paralle! edges, but may expand or contract
slightly. The base is usually straight but may

TRINITY
(Plate 127)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Blades are triangular with edges
straight to convex. Shoulders are poorly developed due to stem being formed by two
long shallow notches, crudely chipped. The
stem is broad, bulging laterally so as to align
with the blade edges, or nearly so. The base
is straight to strongly convex. Stem edges are
sometimes smoothed, the base occasionally
SO.

Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 6 era.,
average 4 to 5 era. Maximum xvidth is across
the shoulders or stem, ranging from 2 to 2.5
cm. The stem is usually 1/4 to 1/3 of the total
length, occasionally nearly 1/2.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type of the Carrollton Focus, Archaic
Stage. Appears occasionally in the East Texas
Aspect. Shalloxv side notches somewhat resemble those of Ensor points (Plate 95) but
are noticeably longer, and the stems are more
bulbous. The stems resemble those of Pahnillas and Williams points (Plates 115, 130) but
the general proportions and workmanship are
quite distinct, as well as the distribution.

DISTRIBUTION
Apparently is most common in the Dallas area
in the valleys of the East Fork and the Trinity
River, extending into northeastern Texas and
southward toward the Brazos River.

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular to leaf-shaped blade, edges
straight to convex, rarely concave ( G ). Shoulders are prominent, either rounded, or
barbed. The stem expands strongly, sometimes being as wide as the shoulders. Bases
have a deep U-shaped concavity similar to
Pedernales points (Plates 118-119) but the
stems are much shorter and flare outward
more. Blade edges are sometimes serrated

(F).
Dimensions: Total length about 4 to 10 era.,
average about 6 cm. Maximum width 2 to
3.5 cm., stems 1.5 to 2 cm. wide and 1/4 to
1/8 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A minor type of the Edwards Plateau Aspect.
Similar to Frio points (Plate 98) but the
blades are longer and narrower, the stems are
not as wide or as flaring; the stem tips point
downward rather than outward and the central notch of Frio points is missing. Also similar to Martindale points (Plate 107) but lack
the two-curve "fish-tail" base of the latter.
Judgment between these three types would
be diNcult in some cases, however.

DISTRIBUTION
Primarily central Texas, extending toward the
central coastal area in the lower Guadalupe
River valley, and toward the Pecos RiverRio Grande confluence area, ~vhere the few
specimens may be intrusive from central
Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Some part of the span 4000 ~.c. to 1000 a.n.
More restricted distribution may indicate
that it is not as old as some other Edwards
Plateau Aspect types.

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Slender triangular blade xvith edges
usually straight, sometimes slightly convex.
Shoulders are small, sometimes are missing
on one or both edges, or occasionally jut out,
but they are not barbed. The most characteristic feature is a very long stem, usually
contracted, but which may approach being
parallel-edged (D, G). The base is nearly
pointed in some eases, rounded in others, or
occasionally concave (H). Stem edges are
usually ground smooth. Blade edges are often serrated (D, F, G).
Dimensions: Total length 4.5 to 8 cm., most
being 6 or 7 cm. Maximum width 1.5 to 9..5
cm., seldom more or less. The stem is often
1/2 of total length, seldom less than 1/3.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Primarily xvith the East Texas Aspect of the
Archaic Stage, surviving into the Alto Focus
of the Neo-Ameriean Stage, the only kno~vn
association ~vith pottery. Also occurs infrequently in the Edwards Plateau Aspect, Archaic Stage.

DISTRIBUTION
Central part of eastern Texas, extending westward into central Texas.

ESTIMATED AGE
About 1000 B.c. to 1000 A.D., or part thereof.

DESCRIPTION
@utline: Broad triangular to leaf-shaped blade
with edges usually slightly to strongly convex,
occasionally nearly straight (A, C, D). Tips
are sometimes slimmed to needle sharpness
(B). Shoulders are pronounced and usually
well barbed. The stem is formed by corner
notches, always expanded, with a convex
base. The stem edges and base may meet at
an angle (B), but usually the stem and base
form a rounded bulb (A, E).
Dimension,s: Total length about 5 to 8 cm. Maximum xvidth 2.5 to 5 cm., most between 3 and
4 cm. Stems usually are bet~veen 2 and :2.5
cm. xvide and 1/4 to 1/6 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type of the Edwards Plateau Aspect.
Similar to the PalmiIlas type (Plate 115),
which also has a bulb-shaped stem, but WiIliams is larger, broader, has better barbs, mad
is much more restricted in distribution. Stems
are not as broad or straight-edged, nor blades

as straight-edged, as those of the CastrovilIe
type (Plate 87). Also similar to the Marcos
type (Plate 105), which has a straighter base
and deeper notches.
DISTRIBUTION
Common in central Texas, extending in[requently into eastern and coastal Texas.

ESTIMATED AGE
Some part of the span 4000 s.c. to 1000 A.D.

YARBROUGH
(Plate 131)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Small, slender, triangular blade with
edges straight to slightly convex, sometimes
asymmetrical. Shoulders are small to prominent but not barbed. Stem edges are parallel
to somewhat expanded and often are ground
smooth. The base is usually straight but may
be slightly concave or convex. The blade is
sometimes beveled, nsually along the right
edge of both faces.
Dimensions: Total length about 3.5 to 8 cm.,
most between 5 and 6 cm. Maximum ~vidth
1.6 to 2.5 em., most about 2 era. Stem width
1 to 1.5 em. and stem length consistently
about 1/3 to 1/4 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type of the East Texas Aspect, Archaic
Stage, continuing into association with pottery in the Alto Focus and perhaps other foci
of the Gibson Aspect, Neo-American Stage.
There is some evidence that it may also survive in some loci of the Fulton Aspect. Occurs in the Elam Focus of the Trinity Aspect,
and apparently extends from the late Edwards Plateau Aspect into the early Central
Texas Aspect in the same manner as Darl
points. It is closely related to the Darl type
(Plate 90) but lacks the extreme slenderness
of the latter, the shoulders are more promi-

nent, the base is more consistently straight
(rather than concave), and the blade is less
frequently beveled. In general, the smaller
specimens of both types are easier to distinguish than the larger ones.
DISTRIBUTION
Common in eastern Texas, decreasing toward
the west in north-central and central Texas.
Occurs in Oklahoma.

ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 500 B.C. to 1000 A.D.

(Plate 132)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade with edges usually
concave or recto"ted, seldom straight. Shoulders are wide, outflaring, and usually barbed.
Stem edges are usually parallel, occasionally
contracted or expanded slightly. Bases are
straight or slightly convex. Blade edges are
sometimes finely serrated.
Dimensions: Total length 1.8 to 3.5 cm. Maximum width quite uniform at about 1.5 cm.,
seldom more or less. Stem length about 0.7
cm. on average, or 1/4 to 1/5 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type of the Alto Focus, occurring also
in the Gahagan, Haley, and Spiro foci of the
Gibson Aspect, and in the Wylie, Henrietta,
and Galveston Bay foci, all of the Neo-American Stage. May appear in the East Texas
Aspect of the Archaic Stage shortly before
pottery appears in this area.
DISTRIBUTION
All of eastern Texas and adjacent states; southward to the coastal plain; and westward with

decreasing frequency into north-central and
central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
About the time of Christ to 1200 A.D. or later.

(Plate 138)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular points with edges straight
to slightly convex. Bases straight to deeply
concave. Two small side notches occur, from
1/4 to 1/2 the distance from base toward tip.
Two subgroups or subtypes may be recognized: those with a third notch in the center
of the base, whether this is straight or concave
(A-H); and those without a base notch (I-P).
In Texas, at least, there appears to be no difference in distribution or time between these
two subtypes, although a wider study in the
Plains and southwestern United States may
show significant differences.
Dimensions: Length 1.5 to 3.5 era. Maximum
~vidth about 1.2 to 2 cm. Notches (both at
the sides and at the base) usually 0.2 to 0.3
em. deep.

occurs in late horizons without agriculture
or pottery.
DISTRIBUTION
See above paragraph. In Texas the type occurs
across the northern parts, extending southward to the upper Brazos and Trinity River
drainages, with occasional specimens, farther
south. Unknown in eastern Texas except for
rare, probably intrusive, specimens.
ESTIMATED AGE
In Texas, perhaps 1100 to 1500 A.D.; not kno~vn
to be associated with historic complexes.
Elsewhere, it may be considerably older.

DESCRIPTION

DISTRIBUTION

In Texas, in the central and southern portions
of the coast and in the south~vestern part of
the state. Continues south into Mexico, where
it has been reported in Tamaulipas, Vera
Cruz, and San Luis Potosl (MacNeish, 1958,
p. 70). Most frequent, ho~vever, in Starr and
Cameron counties, Texas.

Outline: Simple triangular point distinguished
principally by concave base and concave
blade edges. The basal concavity is usually
pronounced, ~vhile the blade edges vary from
slightly concave (A, E) to markedly concave
(F, J).
Dimensions: Total length ranges from
era.; width across the base from 1.5 to
,3 cm. On occasion (F, J) the width
base approaches the length of the
edges, making an isosceles triangle.

lateral

ESTIMATED AGE
Little data available for Texas specimens, but
occurrences in Mexico suggest a range of
about ,900 to 1800 A.D.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type of the Brmvnsville Focus. Also
occnrs, but less commonly, in the Rockport
Focus and, less certainly, in the Mier Focus.
Start points are possibly w~riants of the
Fresno type (Plate 137), but the basic pattern of three concave edges has, in general,
a more southern distribution. By contrast,
Fresno points are found widely in central,
northern, and western Texas. Some Start
points (K) overlap with Turne!] (Plate 147),
but Turney is generally longer and narrower,
and occurs principally in eastern Texas.

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Slender triangular points with edges
occasionally almost straight but usually recurved ~vith a constriction approximately in
the middle. Bases are almost always concave.
Workmanship is extremely fine, blades are
thin and flat. Edges are commonly minutely
serrated, the tip often slimmed down to a
needle-like point.
Dimensions: Length about 2 to 5.5 cm. Maximum ~vidth 1 to 1.8 era. Basal concavity 0.1 to
0.4 cm. deep.

DISTRIBUTION
Northern part of eastern Texas, especially in
the upper drainage systems of the Sabine and
Sulphur rivers, extending to the Red River.
ESTIMATED AGE
1200 to 1500 A.D., possibly continuing with
minor changes into the Turney type in early
historic times, 1600 to 1700 A.D.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A common type in the Titus Focus, Fulton Aspect, large numbers being found in burials.
Overlaps somewhat with Maud points (Plate
141) but bases are not so deep and edges are
much more consistently reeurved; distribution is more restricted. Some overlap also
with Turney points (Plate 147) and ~vith
Fresno points (Plate 137).
