Abstract
The El Paso Water Utilities Board (EPWU) requested archeological monitoring for the Eastside
Wastewater Interceptor Phase 4A, Part 1 project in the eastside area of El Paso, Texas. TRC was
contracted by Brown & Caldwell of El Paso, Texas to provide a Principal Investigator (PI) who would be
in the field 25 percent of the field time. The archeological monitoring was conducted by the Field
Archeologist from the EPWU (Valerie Provencio) who was under the supervision of the TRC-PI (Elia
Perez) while monitoring the construction efforts for this project. Ms. Provencio archeologically
monitored construction efforts between January 3, 2007 and May 6, 2007, for a total of 24 field days.
Ms. Perez was in the field between January 3, 2007 and May 6, 2007, for a total of six days or 25 percent
of the field time. Also, TRC was contracted to generate the draft report with all findings and the
subsequent final report. The archeological monitoring was conducted under Texas Historical
Commission Antiquities Permit No. 4407.
The project area is approximately 4.2 miles (6.76 km) long and 145 ft (44.20 m) wide. The Phase 4A Part
1 project consisted of laying down 6,459 linear feet or 1.22 miles (1.97 km) of 48-inch (1.22-m) wide
interceptor pipe and 3,240 linear feet (988 m) of 60-inch (1.52 m) wide interceptor pipe for a total of
9,699 linear feet or 1.84 miles (2.96 km). The interceptor pipeline was placed from the Mesa Drain to
south of IH-10 at the Eastlake exit. The total construction area of potential effect is 145 ft (44.20 m) of
maximum width and a maximum depth of 45 ft (13.72 m). Tunneling was used to place lines under all
drains and canals. The interceptors represent sewer lines installed along the proposed 4A route. The
Alternate Line was originally recommended as an alternate route and ultimately not selected. The
construction efforts did not yield subsurface cultural prehistoric or historic remains.

Definition of Study Area
EPWU requested archeological monitoring for the Eastside Wastewater Interceptor Phase 4A, Part 1
project in the eastside area. The project area begins at the Mesa Drain Spur, moves west and follows the
El Paso and Socorro Corporate Boundary northeast and west, turns northeast again along Eastlake Drive,
and then north towards the West Texas Airport (Figure 1). The entire project is within the City of El
Paso, Texas.
The project area is approximately 4.2 miles (6.76 km) long and 145 ft (44.20 m) wide. The Phase 4A Part
1 project consisted of laying down 6,459 linear feet or 1.22 miles (1.97 km) of 48-inch (1.22-m) wide
interceptor pipe and 3,240 linear feet (988 m) of 60-inch (1.52 m) wide interceptor pipe for a total of
9,699 linear feet or 1.84 miles (2.96 km). The interceptor pipeline was placed from the Mesa Drain to
south of IH-10 at the Eastlake exit. The total construction area of potential effect is 145 ft (44.20 m) of
maximum width and a maximum depth of 45 ft (13.72 m). Tunneling was used to place lines under all
drains and canals. The interceptors represent sewer lines installed along the proposed 4A route shown on
Figure 1. The Alternate Line was originally recommended as an alternate route and, ultimately, not
selected.
Two previously conducted cultural resource surveys are associated with the current project area (Perez
2001; Perez 2005). The 2001 investigations recorded a limited number of isolated occurrences; therefore,
the expectations of encountering archeological remains were considered low (Perez 2001).
Portions of the project area south of IH-10 were recommended for monitoring by a professional
archeologist (Perez 2005: 12). These include the proposed alternate lines paralleling IH-10 going east.
Several factors led to the recommendation of archeological monitoring of the proposed project area.

some of the areas), other areas with built up sands that may conceal subsurface cultural remains, and a
large number of previously recorded sites.

Management Summary
EPWU requested archeological monitoring for the Eastside Wastewater Interceptor Phase 4A, Part 1
project in the eastside area of El Paso, Texas. TRC was contracted by Brown & Caldwell of El Paso,
Texas to provide a Principal Investigator (PI) who would be in the field 25 percent of the field time. The
archeological monitoring was conducted by the Field Archeologist from EPWU (Valerie Provencio) who
was under the supervision of the TRC-PI (Elia Perez) while monitoring the construction efforts for this
project. At the request of internal engineer, Aide Zamarron, Project Manager, EPWU, Ms. Provencio
archeologically monitored construction efforts between January 3, 2007 and May 6, 2007, for a total of 24
field days. Ms. Perez was in the field between January 3, 2007 and May 6, 2007, for a total of six days,
or 25 percent of the field time. Also, TRC was contracted to generate the draft report with all findings
and the subsequent final report. The archeological monitoring was conducted under Texas Historical
Commission Antiquities Permit No. 4407.
The project area is approximately 4.2 miles (6.76 km) long and 145 ft (44.20 m) wide. The Phase 4A Part
1 project consisted of laying down 6,459 linear feet or 1.22 miles (1.97 km) of 48-inch (1.22-m) wide
interceptor pipe and 3,240 linear feet (988 m) of 60-inch (1.52 m) wide interceptor pipe for a total of
9,699 linear feet or 1.84 miles (2.96 km). The interceptor pipeline was placed from the Mesa Drain to
south of IH-10 at the Eastlake exit. The total construction area of potential effect is 145 ft (44.20 m) of
maximum width and a maximum depth of 45 ft (13.72 m). Tunneling was used to place lines under all
drains and canals. The interceptors represent sewer lines installed along the proposed 4A route shown on
Figure 1. The Alternate Line was originally recommended as an alternate route and, ultimately, not
selected. The construction efforts did not yield subsurface cultural prehistoric or historic remains.

Research Design
TRC contacted the project proponents and government agencies to identify key issues for inclusion in the
archeological monitoring. Based on the Class I site file search conducted at TARL (Texas Archaeological
Resource Laboratory), to ascertain if any previously recorded sites were present within the proposed
right-of-way (ROW) for the 2005 investigations and, subsequently, the current archeological monitoring,
a total of 18 sites have been previously recorded adjacent to the project area. These include 41EP174,
41EP175, 41EP177, 41EP178, 41EP421, 41EP425, 41EP427, 41EP429, 41EP750, 41EP2232, 41EP2378,
41EP2420, 41EP2489, 41EP2592, 41EP5231, 41EP5233, 41EP5255, and 41EP5256. An additional Class
I site file search was conducted at TARL (on-line) to insure that no additional sites have been reported in
proximity to the study area.
Based on the 2005 and 2007 site file search, the sites previously recorded adjacent to the project area will
not be affected by the current installation of sewer lines. Of the sites previously recorded, 12 (41EP174,
41EP175, 41EP177, 41EP178, 41EP421, 41EP425, 41EP427, 41EP429, 41EP750, 41EP2232, 41EP2592,
and 41EP5255) are over 1.243 miles (over 200 m) north or south from the proposed route. These sites are
deflated lithic scatters and/or burned caliche concentrations. Four sites (41EP2378, 41EP2489,
41EP5231, and 41EP5256) are 0.622 miles (100 m) from the route. One site (41EP5233) has been
removed by previous blading of the area. Only 41EP2420 is less than 0.622 miles (100 m) east of the
northern proposed route. This site can be avoided if construction crews remain west (on the dirt road) of
the proposed route. The site consists of a 2 m by 2 m burned caliche scatter, highly deflated.
The field methodology consisted of archeological monitoring of the proposed construction of the
wastewater interceptor line improvements. If exposed, all cultural manifestations representing pre-1950
activities were to be thoroughly documented during the archeological monitoring, and records pertaining

to previously recorded sites were to be updated to reflect current conditions. Only diagnostic cultural
materials were to be collected. All materials collected and records generated would be prepared by TRC
for permanent curation at TARL. No cultural manifestations representing pre-1950 activities were
exposed.
In the event that previously unrecorded archeological sites or features were encountered during the course
of the project, all construction was to be halted and no additional trenches excavated, each site would be
fully documented consistent with THC guidelines including production of a site map indicating site
boundaries and feature locations, photo documentation, artifact descriptions, and a completed TARL
Record form. The location and extent of all sites within the project area were to be recorded using a
Global Positioning System (GPS) and plotted on 7.5-minute maps. Evaluation of site eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) was to be based
predominantly on each siteâs ability to provide important information and the integrity of cultural
deposits. No previously unrecorded archeological sites or features were encountered during the course of
the project.

Results
EPWU requested archeological monitoring for the Eastside Wastewater Interceptor Phase 4A, Part 1
project in the eastside area of El Paso, Texas. At the request of EPWU internal engineer and Project
Manager, Aide Zamarron, EPWU archeologist Valerie Provencio archeologically monitored a portion of
the Eastside Interceptor 48-inch (1.22-m) and 60-inch (1.52-m) pipeline in the Mesa Drain Valley. The
archeological monitoring conducted by Ms. Provencio was under the supervision of the TRC-PI (Elia
Perez), while monitoring the construction efforts for this project.
Vegetation in the area consists of creosote bushes, low-lying mesquite, prickly pear, yucca, a variety of
grasses, four-wing saltbush, and intrusive vegetation such as Russian thistle and nightshade (Figure 2).
The project area is impacted by periodic dumping of modern trash by local residents. The modern debris
consists of broken wood slats, miscellaneous building debris, discarded furniture, tires, glass shards, beer
bottles, soda and beer cans, spent shot gun shells, plastic bottles, and wind blown plastic bags (Figure
3).
The project area is located on the Harkey-Glendale soil associations. The soils of the Harkey-Glendale
association are described as âdeep, nearly level calcareous soils on the Rio Grande floodplainâ (Jaco
1971: 4). These soils are consistent with deep alluvial deposits. The sediments consist of light brown
alluvial sandy loam with very little gravel or caliche inclusions. The caliche bedrock was not evident
even at the maximum depth of 45 ft (13.72 m) [Figures 4 and 5].
The project area is approximately 4.2 miles (6.76 km) long and 145 ft (44.20 m) wide. The Phase 4A Part
1 project consisted of laying down 6,459 linear feet or 1.22 miles (1.97 km) of 48-inch (1.22-m) wide
interceptor pipe and 3,240 linear feet (988 m) of 60-inch (1.52 m) wide interceptor pipe, for a total of
9,699 linear feet or 1.84 miles (2.96 km) [Figures 6 and 7).
The interceptor pipeline was placed from the Mesa Drain to south of IH-10, at the Eastlake exit (Figures 8
and 9). The total construction area of potential effect is 145 ft (44.20 m) of maximum width and a
maximum depth of 45 ft (13.72 m). Tunneling was used to place lines under all drains and canals. The
interceptors represent sewer lines installed along the proposed 4A route shown on Figure 1. The
Alternate Line was originally recommended as an alternate route and, ultimately, not selected.
The construction efforts did not yield subsurface cultural prehistoric or historic remains.

Recommendations
Based on the 2005 and 2007 site file search, the sites previously recorded adjacent to the project area will
not be affected by the current installation of sewer lines. In addition, during the construction efforts, no
subsurface cultural prehistoric or historic remains were exposed.
Because the construction right-of-way is 145 ft (44.20 m) wide, future work in the area, such as pipeline
maintenance, will not require extensive archeological monitoring. An EPWU archeologist is
recommended to monitor any future maintenance or repair to the line in order to ensure that construction
repair crews stay within the existing right-of-way.
