ABSTRACT
During the middle of May 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of about 35 acres which form
the northern boundary of the proposed Walsh Ranch Community Park.
Within the study area are two intermittent tributaries to Mary’s Creek. The
proposed park is located approximately 3,145 feet north of IH 30 and
about 3,225 feet south of Old Weatherford Road in southwestern Tarrant
County, Texas. The archaeological survey was done for Dunaway &
Associates, Inc. which is doing the environmental permitting for Walsh
Ranch. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground
surface or uncovered in four shovel tests.
The absence of archaeological sites is similar to study results in analogous
settings in the Fort Worth Prairie, and, based upon the absence of
archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc. deems that further cultural
resource investigations are unwarranted. The Fort Worth District of the
US Army Corps of Engineers should be advised if buried cultural deposits
are uncovered during construction, and, if found, construction should
cease immediately in that area until proper investigations can be carried
out.

INTRODUCTION

In early May, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a pedestrian archaeological survey of
approximately 35 acres within the proposed Walsh Ranch Community Park. Two
unnamed, intermittent tributaries to Mary’s Creek were investigated within the study
area. The proposed park is located approximately 3,145 feet north of IH 30 and about
3,225 feet south of Old Weatherford Road in southwestern Tarrant County, Texas (Figure
1). This survey was conducted for the engineering firm of Dunaway & Associates, Inc.
which is conducting the environmental permitting for Walsh Ranch.
The purpose of the investigation was to determine if cultural resources are present within
the study area and to make recommendations about their archaeological significance, how
they might be impacted by development and to place the discovered cultural resources in
a regional context. A Texas Antiquities Permit was not required since this is a private
entity conducting business on private land. However, the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission will review this report as the Section 106 review Agency.
Since two drainage possibly containing Waters of the United States will be impacted,
possible federal relevant federal legislation may include Section 404 Permit for the Clean
Waters Act, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and
Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order Number
11593, “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment”, and Procedures for
the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report contains a brief description of the
natural environment and then a summary of previous archaeological investigations in the
area as known from published sources. This is followed by the research design and the
methodology. The description of the results of the field investigation constitutes the
major part of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the
study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Tarrant County is located in North Central Texas. The county consists mainly of
undulating to hilly land and vegetation consists of tall grasses and various species of trees
such as mesquite, elm, oak, pecan and walnut. Streams in the Fort Worth Prairie, in
which the study area lies (Dyksterhuis 1946:Figure 1), drain into the upper tributaries of
the Clear Fork of the Trinity River. The southern portions of the county drains into the
Brazos River (Dyksterhuis 1948:Figure 1). Temperatures range from an average high of
96 degrees in July to an average low of 34 degrees in January. Rainfall averages slightly
more than 32 inches per year (Echeverria 2004:1).
The study area is underlain by the Lower Cretaceous-aged Goodland and Kiamichi
Formations (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). The lowest formation, which is the
Goodland, consists of limestone while the overlying Kiamichi Formation consists of clay
shale.
Soils in the study area belong to the Aledo-Bolar-Sanger Association which are gently
sloping to moderately steep upland loams and clays that range from shallow to deep
(Ressel 1981:General Soils Map). A variety of soils are present, but the channels of the
intermittent tributaries are mapped as containing Bolar clay loam with 3 to 5 percent
slopes and Slidell clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes, neither which are floodplain sediments
(Ressel 1981:Sheet 34).
Prikryl (1993:192-193) suggests that prior to 12,000 BC, the climate of North Central
Texas was cooler and moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 BC, the climate
became warmer and this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. He adds
that the presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 to1050 BC
indicate a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 BC. The later change is
similar to today’s environment. High grass pollen also occurred at approximately AD 450
and from AD 1550 to 1650, and this also indicates drier periods. The presence of
paleosols between AD 1 and 1000 suggested an increase in moisture during this period
with a return to drier conditions after AD 1000.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in North Central Texas
have varied due to the locations and types of projects being carried out. Therefore, the
database of information to which new projects can be compared is limited. The following
culture history is derived from the monograph Lower Elm Fork Prehistory by Daniel J.
Prikryl (1990). Prikryl's framework includes the six prehistoric periods, to which the
historic Native American and European periods have been added.
Using Prikryl’s time framework, the following paragraphs present a brief description of
the culture history of the region.
Historic European
Historic Native American
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Late Archaic
Middle Archaic
Early Archaic
Paleoindian

AD 1800 to Present
AD 1600 to AD 1850
AD 1300 to AD 1600
AD 700 to AD 1300
2,000 BC to AD 700
4,000 BC to 2,000 BC
6,000 BC to 4,000 BC
ca. 11,000 BC to 6,000 BC

The Paleoindian period is distinguished by distinctive projectile point styles attributed to
this period (Meltzer and Bever 1995:Table 1). Many of the points are made of exotic
cherts that are not native to North Central Texas. The Lewisville site and the Aubrey
Clovis site in Denton County are the only excavated Paleoindian sites in the region.
Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream terraces above the level of the
active floodplain. This was a period when large mammals became extinct, and their
extinction is attributed in part to a general drying of the environment.
During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Prikryl (1990:71) can
not confirm Lynott's suggestion, and in fact, he reports fewer bottomland sites than
during the previous period. Middle Archaic sites are predominantly found on the first
terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites tend to be along the Elm Fork rather
than along the smaller tributaries. It appears that population density continued to be low.
Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous period, and sites are located both
along the rivers and along tributaries. There appears to be a strong shift in site location to
the tributary streams and a pronounced population explosion. Local Ogallala quartzite is
being used prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors as
evidence of increased territorial restrictions (Prikryl 1990).
During the Late Prehistoric I period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact
assemblages. Houses and probable evidence of agriculture first appear during this period,
although none are known in the immediate area. Site locations mirror those of the Late

Archaic, and quartzite continues as the common material used for chipped stone
projectiles and tools. The West Fork Paleosol is dated to this period, and drying
continued into the subsequent period (Peter and McGregor 1988; Ferring 1990).
The Late Prehistoric II is highlighted by the prominence of buffalo in archaeological sites
and the appearance of tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains of
West Texas. It also appears that sites are once again located on sandy terraces above the
floodplains (Peter and McGregor 1988).
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, according to some historical
documents, the aboriginal inhabitants of North Central Texas continued to play an
infamous if not important role in the history of that region. Very little archaeological
evidence, however, of historic Native American occupation has been found in the North
Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas, and one which has been
suggested is due to the inability of the Native Americans to adapt to the changing climate
(Skinner 1988).
The 1830s and 1840s were decades of Anglo expansion into North Central Texas. Garrett
(1972:24), a well-respected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities almost
depopulated North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than half".
According to tradition, many Indians of several tribes roamed the region until well into
the 1860s. Strategies for dealing with the illusive aboriginal population ranged from
armed confrontation and pursuit to across-the-table dialogue. Rising from a domestic
background of dealing with Indians, President of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston,
realized rapprochement was preferable to direct confrontation. In the summer of 1843, a
council with the Indians was called, and in September of that year ten tribes signed a
treaty which was approved by the Senate the following January. The treaty provided the
needed impetus for settlement of several counties in the North-Central Texas area.
The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day
Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). The
county itself was organized in 1850, but it was not until 1860 that Fort Worth was
officially named the county seat, that designation having been transferred from Birdville
(Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county during
those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although
only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57).
In 1849, Major Ripley Allan Arnold was assigned to build a military post on the upper
Trinity in the largely uninhabited geographical region of the Grand Prairie and the
Eastern Cross Timbers. This encampment was established on a high bluff overlooking the
confluence of the West and Clear Forks of the Trinity River. Within a short length of
time, there were about 12 double log cabins near the fort, and life in Fort Town definitely
had its refinements (Garrett 1972:80). The fort as a military post was relatively shortlived. Faced with the continual westward movement of the frontier, it was decided that
Fort Worth no longer commanded a strategic place in the line of defense for settlers. In

September of 1853, troops abandoned the barracks and parade ground to the local
population.
The Civil War took its toll on Fort Worth's population, as most of the able-bodied men
left to fight for the Confederacy. The young town's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. By the end of the nineteenth century,
Fort Worth had shed its "six-shooter" culture for a more refined cow town culture which
was beginning to use its past to advantage.
Oil was the next great influence on the life of Fort Worth. Fort Worth became the
gateway to the West Texas oil fields and both fed the population and served as an
impetus for post-World War II industrial development. The Convair plant and Tarrant
Field (later Carswell Field) had played an important role during the war, and rather than
lose their jobs the employees were retained to work on a secret project, the B-36. Once
again, Fort Worth became a focal point for an industry as she had for so many decades.
Previous Investigations
No archaeological sites were listed within or in the vicinity of the study area (Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas 2007) nor are any residences plotted on the Sam Street’s 1895
map of Tarrant County. AR Consultants, Inc. has conducted several archaeological
surveys in the area. Todd (2004a) conducted an archeological survey of a gas pipeline
route northwest of the survey area. The proposed pipeline route crossed both Mary’s
Creek and Patterson Branch. Shovel tests on either side of Mary’s Creek failed to find
any cultural materials. Patterson Branch was not tested because shallow soil overlay
limestone bedrock and ground visibility was such that it was determined no cultural
materials were present.
Geo-Marine, Inc. (Hunt, Peter and Morrell 1996) conducted an archaeological survey of
two areas adjacent to Mary’s Creek within the Westside Recycling and Disposal Facility
which is east and northeast of the study area. No cultural materials were found on the
ground surface of approximately 12 acres or in 26 shovel tests that extended to
approximately 50 cm below the ground surface.
Approximately 35,000 feet of water pipeline route for the City of Fort Worth was
surveyed by AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2004b) northwest and north of the study area.
Twenty-seven shovel tests supplemented by augering to approximately 130 cm below the
ground were excavated as were two backhoe trenches to approximately 3 m below the
ground surface along the banks of Mary’s Creek and Little Mary’s Creek. No cultural
materials were found. AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2004c) then returned and surveyed
approximately 46,000 feet of sewer pipeline route for the City of Fort Worth. Eighty-six
shovel tests supplemented by augering to approximately 130 cm and one backhoe trench
to about 3 m below the ground surface were excavated along Mary’s Creek and Patterson
Branch. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or
cultural deposits uncovered in the shovel tests and backhoe trench.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The purpose of the research design was to insure that fieldwork would make a
contribution to the better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement in the area.
Two research problems are presented below.
There is low potential for archaeological sites being found in the study
area due to the low biotic diversity, lack of perennial water and absence of
knappable lithic resources
and,
There is little likelihood of encountering historic sites because the land
probably was used for farming and ranching.
An even more basic, research problem guided the survey; simply stated the question
asked
How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they
leave behind?
Most frequently, small-scale surveys of this type gather information in response to this
more open-ended research question, which guides almost all archaeological surveys.
Methodology
In order to address these questions, an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey was
conducted adjacent to the intermittent tributaries to Mary’s Creek and along the ridges
overlooking the drainages. Transects generally were oriented northeast-southwest and
spaced approximately 30 m apart. Shovel tests were placed on a judgmental basis as
suggested by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002). Shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 35 cm below the ground surface due to the upland setting and absence of a
floodplain. The clay matrices were not screened, but were broken manually and visually
inspected for cultural materials. The pit walls were examined for cultural materials as
well. Notes on the terrain, vegetation and other relevant material were made and
photographs were taken.
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the shallow depth to the subsoil and limestone
bedrock.

RESULTS
The results section is divided into various parts. In the first part, the survey area is
described and the survey is discussed in the second part. The general information derived
from the shovel tests is used in the survey discussion. For individual shovel test
information, please see Table 1. The locations of the shovel tests are shown on Figure 4.
Conclusions which end the chapter.
Survey Area
The terrain ranges from level moderately sloping to gently sloping. The land is in
unimproved pasture. Limestone bedrock outcrops on the surface throughout the study
area as shown on Figure 2, but a variety of trees including eastern red cedar, hackberry,
oak, elm and mesquite can be found along the drainages. Grama grasses and johnson
grass are present throughout the area (Figure 3) and other understory vegetation includes
black-eyed susans, Indian paint brush, yucca, prickly pear, saw greenbriar and grape vine.
Eye-height visibility ranged from excellent in the unimproved pasture to about 20 m in
the forested areas. Ground visibility averaged at least 50 percent.
Two intermittent first order drainages are present within the study area. The westernmost
is referred to as the western drainage and the other the eastern drainage. The western
drainage averages about a meter deep and wide. Water was flowing over a loamy clay
and sandstone gravel and cobble substrate. The water’s maximum depth was about 0.25
meters. The eastern drainage averages 2 m wide and about 1.5 m deep. Clear water was
ponded in a substrate similar to the western drainage. Both drainages were formed from
run-off between ridge toes. No knappable lithic resources were found in either drainage.
The Survey
Survey began in the southwest corner. No shovel tests were placed along the western
drainage or the area adjacent to it due to good ground visibility from the numerous cow
trails, armadillo holes and bedrock limestone outcropping on the surface.
Shovel test 1 was placed on the eastern drainage’s west bank where it encounters the park
boundary. The shovel test uncovered 35 cm of culturally sterile loamy clay. Shovel test 2
was placed about 100 m north of ST 1 and uncovered 37 cm of the same sterile loamy
clay in ST 1. Shovel testing was done in this area because of the low ground visibility in
the grass as shown in Figure 3. No shovel testing along the eastern drainage’s banks were
excavated until ST 3 because the drainage basically ceased to exist (Figure 5). Shovel test
3 was excavated on the eastern drainage’s east bank and uncovered 33 cm of culturally
sterile loamy clay and ST 4 was uncovered approximately 100 m north of ST 3 and
encountered 37 cm of culturally sterile loamy clay.
Shovel testing was not done in the rest of the survey area due to the good ground
visibility from limestone outcropping onto the surface, the vegetation pattern and cow
trails.

Conclusions
No cultural materials older than 50 years were found during the intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey or in the four shovel tests. The absence of historic sites probably is
due to the distance from a roadway. The lack of prehistoric sites probably is a result of
the low biotic diversity, absence of perennial water and lack of knappable lithic
resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are
present within the proposed Walsh Ranch Community Park. No evidence of prehistoric
or historic occupation was found. AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural
resource investigations are unwarranted within the study area. We further recommend
that construction supervisors be advised that buried archaeological materials could be
uncovered during construction, although we deem it very unlikely. If this situation should
arise, work should immediately cease in that area and the Fort Worth District of the US
Army Corps of Engineers should be advised of the discovery.
