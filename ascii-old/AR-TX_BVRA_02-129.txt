ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of seven areas (7.50 acres) in east-central Caldwell
County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in October
2003 under Texas Antiquities Permit 3239. This project was reviewed by the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division. The Federal agency involved with this project
is the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development. The area was
investigated through shovel testing and backhoe trenching. No evidence of a prehistoric
archaeological site was found in any of the seven areas surveyed, and no artifacts were
collected. One historic bridge (41CW91) dating to the early 20th Century spans Plum
Creek. This bridge is not in use today and will not be affected by the water line. It is
recommended that the Polonia Water Supply Corporation (WSC) be allowed to proceed
with construction as planned with no further archaeological investigations. Copies of this
report are on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL); Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division; Polonia WSC in Lockhart, Texas; and BVRA in Bryan,
Texas.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by Polonia WSC through Neptune-Wilkinson Associates, Inc.,
Consulting Engineers of Austin, Texas, to conduct an archaeological survey of a proposed
water line and well site that will service the residents of rural Caldwell County (Figure 1).
The survey areas are depicted on the USGS 7.5' topographic maps Dale (dated 1964 and
photorevised 1981) (map number 2997-344), Harwood (dated 1964 and photorevised
1981) (map number 2997-314), and McMahan (dated 1963 and photorevised 1981) (map
number 2997-341).
Improvements to the distribution system will consist of adding approximately 22
miles of new water line throughout the existing service and a well site on a two acre tract.
The line will be installed in easements on private property and along state and county
roads within the public right-of-way. Water lines at creek crossings will be encased and
creek bottoms restored to their original condition.
Caldwell County is in an area known to contain significant archaeological sites.
Because of this potential, an archaeological survey by a professional archaeologist was
warranted according to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The Federal
agency involved in this project is the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural
Development. Since this project is sponsored by Polonia WSC, a political subdivision of the
State of Texas, an antiquities permit was required, and Antiquities Permit 3239 was issued
to BVRA by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division. The project number
assigned by BVRA is 03-28.
Prior to the field survey, an assessment of the project area was conducted by the
Principal Investigator (William E. Moore) and the Project Archaeologist (Edward P. Baxter).
Within the 22 mile project area, nine areas (1-9) were selected for survey. These areas
were examined on October 21 and 23, 2003.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Caldwell County is located in the Central Texas Archeological Region within the
Central and Southern Planning Region as defined by Mercado-Allinger et al. (1996:Figure
1.1.4). In 1996, there were no sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and
only four sites designated as State Archeological Landmarks (Mercado-Allinger et al.
1996:19). Since 1996, at least one additional site (41CW58) has been designated as a
State Archeological Landmark (Moore 2003). At the time of this survey, 90 sites were
known to exist in the county (TARL site files).
In general, this part of Caldwell County has not been subjected to large-scale
archaeological surveys. According to Baxter and Shafer (n.d.:2), writing in the 1970s,
"previous archeological work in Caldwell County has been almost nonexistent." The
topographic maps at the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, show four
negative surveys by the Soil Conservation Service and one survey by the Texas
Department of Transportation within the area.
A check of the site records at TARL indicate two prehistoric sites and two historic
sites in the general area. These are 41CW9, a prehistoric site near Plum Creek that was
recorded by avocational archaeologists in 1974; 41CW40, a historic mine recorded by the
Caldwell County Historical Commission in 1989; 41CW49, a prehistoric site; and 41CW50,
two historic residences. Both sites were recorded by the Texas Water Development Board
in 1995. No site forms for 41CW49 and 41CW50 are on file at TARL, and no report
documenting the survey is in the TARL library. Site 41CW25, located on a tributary of
Plum Creek, was tested by the Texas Highway Department in 1984. It was not considered
significant as only 14 flakes were recovered.
Very little information exists for the prehistoric sites near the project area. Those
recorded near the project area are located on elevated landforms adjacent to streams that
contained water in the past. The preferred location for more permanent sites was on
sandy hills. Lithic procurement sites can be found on hills with clay soils provided natural
cobbles suitable for stone tool manufacture are present. These sites are usually restricted
to the surface, although some downward artifact movement is possible in areas where
plowing has occurred. The more significant sites are found on major streams, often at
confluences. The upper reaches of streams, especially minor tributaries, are low
probability areas for sites.
Historic sites can occur anywhere within the county; however, it is not common to
find a standing structure within the APE when it is only 15 feet wide. The bridge at Plum
Creek (41CW91) is an exception since it crosses the creek well within the road right-ofway.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check for previously recorded sites in or near
the project area was conducted by Allegra Azulay at TARL, the state repository for site
records. No previously recorded archaeological sites were found to be within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). An assessment of the 22 mile project area was conducted in order
to identify areas to be surveyed. In all, nine areas were identified (1-9).
Although nine areas were identified for survey, only seven (1-4; 7-9) were examined
through shovel testing and backhoe trenching (Figure 2; Table 1). Areas 5 and 6 were
found to have a firm clay at the surface, and no cobbles suitable for stone tool manufacture
were observed on the surface. When possible, excavated dirt was screened using 1/4"
hardware cloth. Shovel tests were excavated to basal clay in most cases. Shovel test data
were recorded in the field notes and appear in this report as Appendix I. Selected shovel
tests were photographed with a digital camera, and GPS plottings were taken at the
location of each test for more accurate plotting on the topographic map (Appendix II). In
all, 27 shovel tests were excavated.
The floodplains of Plum Creek, Tenney Creek, and Daniels Creek were examined
through backhoe trenching. At these locations, the excavators looked for evidence of
buried sites in the form of mussel shell, burned rock, and/or lithic artifacts. The trenches
were profiled in the field and photographed with a digital camera. GPS plottings were
taken at the location of each trench for more accurate plotting on the topographic map
(Appendix II). Since the soils in most of these areas consist of heavy clays, screening was
only possible at Backhoe Trench 7 on Daniels Creek. As a result, clay lumps at the other
trenches were broken apart by hand or with a trowel. The eight backhoe trenches were
excavated in 30 cm levels with samples of earth examined at each level. Munsell readings
of the soils were taken. The depth of each backhoe trench met or exceeded the four foot
APE as planned for the water line. Specific information regarding each backhoe trench is
presented in Appendix III. Six backhoe trenches (1-6) were excavated within the floodplain
of Plum Creek with five on the west side and one on the east side (Appendix II). One
backhoe (7) trench was excavated at Daniels Creek (Appendix II). It was dug on the
opposite side of the road from the proposed water line because that side had been
thoroughly disturbed through road construction. One trench (8) was excavated at Tenney
Creek (Appendix II).
It was sterile, and additional trenches in this area were not
considered necessary.
At the crossing of Plum Creek on County Road 197, a historic county road bridge
was assessed by the field crew and recorded at TARL as 41CW91. The field crew
measured the width, length, and height of the bridge and took photographs with a digital
camera. The bridge was originally recorded by Joe Denton of the Texas Highway
Department in 1985, but no TARL number was assigned.

As part of this project, a two acre well site will be constructed within a 200 acre area.
Although the exact location has not been determined, the probable site has been
narrowed to a 10 acre area. Based on our "windshield survey" of the general area and a
review of the topographic map, BVRA believes this to be a very low probability setting for a
significant archaeological site. Because landowner permission to shovel test had not been
granted at the time of this survey, it was not formally examined.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A check of the site records at TARL revealed no prehistoric sites within the APE as
defined by Polonia WSC. One historic site (41CW91), an early 20th Century bridge, was
observed at the Plum Creek crossing on County Road 197. The name of this site is the
Plum Creek Through Truss Bridge (Figure 3). It was recorded for the Texas Department of
Transportation in 1985 with the site number CALD-011. The estimated date of this
structure is 1922, a time that coincides with the oil boom in the area. This is a large, single
span, steel, Pratt type through truss bridge with wood floor, wood stringers, and concretefilled steel pipe abutments. Pin connected joints allow flexibility for movement. The survey
crew measured the bridge and obtained the following: height (28 feet), length (126 feet),
and width (13 feet 9 inches). This bridge was in use through 1985 when the current bridge
was constructed. An old metal sign attached to the bridge gives the weight limit at 5 tons.
It will not be affected by the water line. Several cemeteries and historic structures are
present in the area. They will not be affected by construction of the water line.
No prehistoric sites were found as a result of this survey. According to Baxter and
Shafer (n.d.:2), significant archaeological sites are most likely to be found along the major
streams in the county such as the San Marcos River and Plum Creek. Sites may also be
expected to occur on the lesser streams if there was a dependable supply of water in
prehistoric times as well as exploitable plant and animal resources.
In general, the water line avoids high probability areas. Much of the route of the
proposed water line is on slopes and in low areas. Deep sand on the upland ridges and
first terraces is rare. In all but two cases shovel tests encountered basal clay at depths
between 20 and 60 cm. The two areas containing deep sandy soils (100 cm) are located
on a slope in an area believed by BVRA to be an unlikely setting for a significant
archaeological site. The one major floodplain in the area (Plum Creek) was tested with six
backhoe trenches, and no subsurface cultural materials were found. Backhoe trenches
were also excavated at two minor streams, Daniels Creek and Tenney Creek. They were
negative as well.
The proposed well site will be placed on a two acre site within a ten acre tract. The
topography of the ten acres contains a high point and saddle and slopes of an upland
ridge. There is no nearby water source to the 10 acres. Therefore, this area is believed to
be a low probability setting for a significant archaeological site, and shovel testing is not
recommended.

The six backhoe trenches at Plum Creek were found to be within soils of the Trinity
Series, specifically Trinity clay (Tr) and Trinity soils, frequently flooded (Ts) (Lowther and
Werchan 1978:29-30). These are nearly level soils on floodplains along local streams. In
areas of Tr soils (trenches 1-2), old sloughs dissect the surface in many places, and they
carry floodwater annually in some places. The Ts soils flood several times each year, and
constant scouring and deposition during flooding have caused surface alteration creating
soil patterns that are not uniform. The surface layer is clay or silty clay, but areas of clay
loam and silt loam may be included. According to the soil survey, these are soils of recent
alluvium.
The two backhoe trenches at Daniels Creek (7) and Tenney Creek (8) were found
to be within soils of the Gowen series, specifically Gowen soils, frequently flooded (Gs)
(Lowther and Werchan 1978:19). These are nearly level soils on bottomlands that are
frequently flooded. Slopes are less than one percent, and the surface is undulating where
deposition occurs during flooding. Soil patterns are not uniform. Some areas have a clay
loam surface layer, and other areas have a silty clay, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam
surface layer. According to the soil survey (Lowther and Werchan 1978:67), these are
soils of recent alluvium.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Historic site 41CW91, a 20th century bridge, was assessed as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that this site be avoided during construction of the water line.
Several cemeteries and historic structures were observed near the project area. It is
recommended that they be avoided. No prehistoric sites were found during the shovel
testing and backhoe trenching. It is, therefore, recommended that construction be allowed
to proceed as planned. Should any evidence of an archaeological site not discussed in this
report be encountered during construction of the proposed water line, work in the area
where the find has been made should be temporarily suspended until the situation can be
evaluated by a professional archaeologist in consultation with the Texas Historical
Commission, BVRA, and Polonia WSC.
