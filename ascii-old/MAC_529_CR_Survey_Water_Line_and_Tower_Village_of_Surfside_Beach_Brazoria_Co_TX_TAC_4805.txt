ABSTRACT
On February 18-20, 2008, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural resource
survey investigation for two elements comprising a water supply project in the Village of Surfside
Beach, Brazoria County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations were
conducted for the Village of Surfside Beach, under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4805. An
intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test) examination. A total of 61 shovel tests were excavated, 56 along the
pipeline route and five in the water tower tract. While the presence of a high water table (25-75
cmbs) precluded many of these tests from reaching the total depth of proposed impact (ca. 100
cm), the excavation of most of the tests were able to reach at least a depth 70-80 cm. This depth
was felt to be sufficient in this case because the water line will be installed within the extant
utility and road drainage easement that is already highly disturbed. In many instances these
shovel tests were excavated in the roadside drainage ditch with a ground surface that is already
below natural grade. No evidence of archeological or historic remains or features was identified
in any of the shovel tests. Consequently, no further archeological investigations are
recommended. In the event that archeological deposits or features should be encountered during
construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
element consists of an approximately 17,688
ft (5391 m) long water supply line that is
restricted to the existing CR 257 (Blue
Water Highway) right-of-way (ROW). The
water supply line will be 12 inches in
diameter, and will be buried to a depth of
three feet. The second element consists of a
140 ft high water tank with a capacity of
250,000 gallons that will occupy a ground
footprint of less that one acre.

On February 18-20, 2008, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for
two elements comprising a water supply
project in the Village of Surfside Beach,
Brazoria County, Texas. The objectives of
the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0807) were conducted for the Village of
Surfside Beach, under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4805.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination. A total of 61
shovel tests (STs 1-61) were excavated. The
field investigations were conducted by
project archeologist Randy Ferguson and
field technicians Lisa Rodriguez and Kelly
Shexnayder. David Driver served as the
projectâs principal investigator.

The project area is depicted on the
Freeport, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The proposed
project includes the construction of a water
line and an elevated water tank. The first

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Hydrology
The project area is located along the
seaward side of CR 125 (Bluewater
Highway), which lies from 200-400 m from
the Gulf of Mexico shoreline.
The
southernmost end of the pipeline route is
located approximately 500 m from the
mouth of the Old Brazos River.

Soils and Geology
Brazoria County is located within
the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Flora and Fauna
Brazoria County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. San Jacinto
County is situated within the pine-oak
subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the
dominant floral species of the pine-oak
forest subdivision as loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica). Hardwood forests are found
on lowlands within the Austroriparian and
are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra), and
other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as
well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss
(Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra).

The project area is located on the
inset on sheets 104 and 109 of the Soil
Survey of Brazoria County, Texas
(Crenwelge et al. 1981). The two soil types
present in the project area are Galveston fine
sand, undulating (18), and Mustang fine
sand (30). Galveston fine sand is described
as somewhat excessively drained with very
slow surface runoff (Crenwelge et al.
1981:22). Mustang fine sand is described as
spoorly drained with very slow surface
runoff (Crenwelge et al. 1981:30).

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,

Climate
The modern climate of the Brazoria
County study area consists of long, hot and
humid summers and warm winters
(Crenwelge et al. 1981:1-2).
Summer
temperatures average 81Â°F (27Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 55Â°F (13Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 52 inches
(132 cm).

turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat

may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for

stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.
However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the

Bellâs Landing (East Columbia), Columbia,
and Brazoria. By the 1830s, lucrative cotton
farming made the areaâs plantation owners
some of the wealthiest citizens of the state.
County residents and settlements played
important roles in the Texas Revolution, and
by May of 1836, Velasco had become the
seat of the interim capital of the republic.
The county was established that same year,
with the town of Brazoria named its county
seat.
The present boundaries were
determined over the following two years
with the establishment of Fort Bend and
Galveston Counties.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

The countyâs economy continued to
revolve around cotton cultivation, resulting
in a heavy dependence on slaveholding. By
1860, 72 percent of the countyâs 7100 total
population consisted of black slaves.
Consequently, the end of the Civil War
brought widespread depression for the
countyâs economy, and resulted in
significant changes in both demography and
industry. While some plantations were
broken up into smaller farms and others
turned to pasture, some residents left the
county, moving to the Mexican state of Vera

Historic Overview
Anglo-American settlement in the
Brazoria County area began in the early
1820s, with the arrival of eighty-nine
families of Austinâs Old Three Hundred
(Kleiner 1996). The earliest settlements
included Velasco (present day Surfside),

Cruz. The primary crops became more
diversified, shifting to corn, grains, sweet
and Irish potatoes, fruits, wild grapes, as
well as cotton and sugar for export (Kleiner
1996:710). By 1871, the introduction of

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
identified in the 1974 survey. Two of the
prehistoric sites were reevaluated in the
1980 investigation. Other investigations
relevant to the current survey include Atenâs
(1971) excavations at the Dow-Cleaver Site
(41BO35), three projects carried out by
Texas A&M University Laboratory of
Archaeology, in the mid-1970s (Baxter and
Ippolito 1976; Ippolito and Baxter 1976;
Dering and Ayers 1977).
Moore
Archeological Consulting conducted a
survey of a proposed well pad and access
road in the San Bernard National Wildlife
Refuge in 1987 (Moore 1987). No cultural
resource sites were found during this survey.
A survey of state-owned portions of the
Texaco, Sargent East seismic project was
also negative for cultural resources (Moore
1986). Moore Archeological Consulting
also conducted surveys of the Mims
Prospect well location (Moore 1991) and
tow Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge
improvement areas (Moore and Dureka
1995. The outcome of both of these surveys
was negative.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in the project area.
However, several historic sites, including
the historic port of Valasco, are located
within 1 km of the alignment.
The project is located on the Texas
coast, in an area of sluggish bayous, inland
bays, and salt marsh. The active channel of
Old Brazos River is located approximately
Â½ km from the southwest end of the
alignment, while Oyster Creek and Swan
Lake are located along its path. Only a
limited
amount
of
archaeological
investigations have occurred in the Brazoria
County area (Moore 1989).

The Ellerslie Plantation (41BO80)
was examined during initial investigations
for
the
Seadock
facility
(Texas
Archeological Survey Research Staff 1974).
The site was evaluated as potentially eligible
for the National Register of Historic Places.
The site was not revisited in the 1980 study
for the Seadock facility (Nightingale 1980).

Two cultural resource surveys have
been conducted in the project area vicinity
in conjunction with the propose Seadock
facility (Nightingale 1980).

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
be placed the in the exact line of the
alignment, but the tests were never more
than three meters away from it. There were
also a few locations that had to exceed the
100-m intervals due to long expanses of
disturbance (driveways, cross streets, etc.),
but this variance never exceeded 20 meters.

The fieldwork was conducted on
February 18-20, 2008, and consisted of a
100% pedestrian survey that included
systematic shovel testing and visual
examination for surface exposure of cultural
materials (Figure 2).
The project area is depicted on the
Freeport, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The proposed
project includes the construction of a water
line and an elevated water tank. The first
element consists of an approximately 17,688
ft (5391 m) long water supply line that is
restricted to the existing CR 257 (Blue
Water Highway) right-of-way (ROW). The
water supply line will be 12 inches in
diameter, and will be buried to a depth of
three feet. The second element consists of a
140 ft high water tank with a capacity of
250,000 gallons that will occupy a ground
footprint of less that one acre.

A high water table was encountered
in many tests that are precluding them from
reaching as deeply as one meter below
surface; however, the crew attempted to
ensure that the tests reached at least 3/4 of
the proposed 1-meter pipeline depth before
they had to be abandoned. The situation is
not unusual as one of the long time residents
informed the field director that the normal
water table in Surfside is only 2.5-ft below
the surface. The soils encountered in the
tests were typical of seacoast and barrier
island environments, with sand intermixed
with shell and shell hash. Some modern
disturbance was noted in the upper layers.
The road was built up to the east of CR 332,
and more substantial fill soil deposits were
encountered. No cultural materials were
recovered from any of the shovel testing
conducted along the waterline alignment.

A total of 61 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 2;
Appendix 1). The location of each test was
recorded and plotted on the project map.

The final set of five shovel tests (STs 57-61)
were placed within the plot set aside for the
water tower. This tract is roughly one acre
in size and is located on the northwest side
of the highway. The majority of the tract is
inundated salt marsh, with only the portion
of the tract close to the highway presenting
an accessible ground surface (Figure 4).
Large portions of this area were covered in
piles of fill soil from a recently drilled water
well. The crew placed three shovel tests
(STs 57-59) around the edges of these fill
piles. In addition, two high spots in the salt
marsh were tested (STs 60, 61). No cultural
materials were recovered from any of the
shovel tests conducted in the water tower
tract.

The first 56 shovel tests (STs 1-56)
were placed along the proposed route of the
3 ft deep waterline. The water line is to be
located in the easement between the
roadway and the private property lines,
within the existing ROW (Figure 3).
Significant disturbances were evident along
the entire route, including that from road and
roadside ditch construction, and the presence
of various types of utility lines.
The field methodology was to place
shovel tests at 100-m intervals throughout
the length of the alignment. These tests
were located as close to the proposed water
line placement location as practically
possible. There were instances throughout
the alignment where shovel tests could not

RECOMMENDATIONS
An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination. A total of 61
shovel tests were excavated, 56 along the
pipeline route and five in the water tower
tract. While the presence of a high water
table (25-75 cmbs) precluded many of these
tests from reaching the total depth of
proposed impact (ca. 100 cm), the
excavation of most of the tests were able to
reach at least a depth 70-80 cm. This depth
was felt to be sufficient in this case because
the water line will be installed within the
extant utility and road drainage easement
that is already highly disturbed. In many
instances these shovel tests were excavated
in the roadside drainage ditch with a ground
surface that is already below natural grade.

On February 18-20, 2008, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for
two elements comprising a water supply
project in the Village of Surfside Beach,
Brazoria County, Texas. The objectives of
the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0807) were conducted for the Village of
Surfside Beach, under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4805.
The proposed project includes the
construction of a water line and an elevated
water tank. The first element consists of an
approximately 17,688 ft (5391 m) long
water supply line that is restricted to the
existing CR 257 (Blue Water Highway)
right-of-way (ROW). The water supply line
will be 12 inches in diameter, and will be
buried to a depth of three feet. The second
element consists of a 140 ft high water tank
with a capacity of 250,000 gallons that will
occupy a ground footprint of less that one
acre.

No evidence of archeological or
historic remains or features was identified in
any of the shovel tests. Consequently, no
further archeological investigations are
recommended.
In the event that
archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.
