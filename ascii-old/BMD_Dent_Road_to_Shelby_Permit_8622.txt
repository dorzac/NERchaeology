Abstract

ABSTRACT
Garland Power & Light (GP&L) contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. to perform a
background review and cultural resources survey for the Dent Road to Shelby 138-kilovolt (kV)
Transmission Line (Project) in Hunt County, Texas. The following report provides information regarding
the Project and includes the methods and results of the cultural resources background review and an
archeological survey of an approximately 5.7 mile (9.2 kilometer [km])-long by 120 feet (36.6 meter)wide, proposed Area of Potential Effects (APE) comprising 82.9 acres.

Due to landowner restrictions, survey of three non-contiguous parcels was denied during the initial
archeological survey, thus the archeological survey was conducted over two mobilizations. The initial
survey was conducted between November 26 and 29, 2018 and consisted of an archeological survey of
4.98 miles (8.01 km) or 72.4 acres. The subsequent survey of the remaining 0.72 miles (1.1 km) or 10.5
acres was conducted on August 15, 2019. Detailed results of the subsequent archeological survey are
provided in Appendix D of this report. Both surveys, as well as archeological monitoring were conducted
under Antiquities Permit #8622. The project will be constructed under Nationwide Permit 12, Utility
Lines without requirement for a pre-construction notification to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;
however, compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act is still required.

Two historic-age archeological sites were recorded during the initial survey (Sites 41HU92 and 41HU93).
Both sites represent the remnants of early-to mid-twentieth century farmsteads and are recommended not
eligible for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) inclusion or State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL)
designation. The THC concurred that site 41HU92 is ineligible within the APE and 41HU93 is ineligible
for SAL designation or NRHP listing on August 30, 2019.

One historic-age archeological site was recorded during the subsequent survey (41HU95). Site 41HU95
represents the remnants of an early-to-mid-twentieth century homestead and is recommended not eligible
for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation. No artifacts were collected. Project records and photograph will
be curated at TARL. The THC concurred that site 41HU95 is ineligible for SAL designation or NRHP
listing on September 30, 2019.

Burns & McDonnell conducted archeological monitoring of structure locations in the areas around Farber
Creek and Mustang Branch which are associated with the Kaufman and Hopco soil series and which
contain the potential for deeply buried deposits. Archeological monitoring was conducted between

Introduction

INTRODUCTION

Garland Power & Light (GP&L) contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns &
McDonnell) to perform a background review, archeological survey, and archeological monitoring for the
Dent Road to Shelby 138-kilovolt (kV) Transmission Line (Project) in the city of Greenville, Hunt
County, Texas (Figure 1-1). The following report provides information regarding the Project and includes
the methods and results of the cultural resources background review and archeological survey following
the report guidelines set forth by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).

Introduction

Project Description

The Project involves construction of Dent Road to Shelby 138-kV Transmission line. Specifically, GP&L
proposes to construct approximately 5.7 miles (9.2 kilometers [km]) of 138-kV suspended power lines
attached to monopole towers within proposed 120-foot (36.6-meters [m]) wide easement (Figure 1-1).
Tower intervals vary depending on tower location and inflection points of the transmission line but are
general purposed to be positioned at 0.15-mile (0.24 km) intervals. The depth of impact is estimated to

reach approximately 58 feet (17.7 m) below the current ground surface at monopole tower locations.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) is therefore defined as 5.7 miles (9.2 km) -long by 120 feet (36.6
m) -wide, 82.9-acre proposed easement to a maximum depth of 58 feet (17.7 m).
Due to landowner restrictions, survey of three non-contiguous parcels was denied during the initial
archeological survey, thus the archeological survey was conducted over two mobilizations. The initial
survey consisted of an archeological survey of 4.98 miles (8.01 km) or 72.4 acres. The subsequent survey
consisted of the remaining 0.72 miles (1.1 km) or 10.5 acres. The results of the subsequent archeological
survey are provided in Appendix D of this report. Both surveys, as well as the archeological monitoring
were conducted under Antiquities Permit# 8622 (Appendix B). The project will be constructed under
Nationwide Permit 12, Utility Lines without requirement for a pre-construction notification to the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers; however, compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act is still required. Additionally, the proposed Project is funded by GP&L, a not-for-profit municipal
utility owned by the City of Garland, a political subdivision of the State of Texas. Therefore, compliance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) is required.

Project History and Personnel

Burns & McDonnell cultural resources specialists conducted a background review prior to the
commencement of fieldwork. The initial archeological survey of portions APE for which access was
provided was conducted between November 26 and 29, 2018, by Principal Investigator Dan Rodriguez
and Ryan Oelke. The subsequent survey was conducted by Dan. Rodriguez and Shelly Wunderlich on
August 15, 2019 (Appendix D). Archeological monitoring was conducted by Miles Martin between
September 20, 2019 and November 11, 2019 (Appendix E).

RESEARCH DESIGN

The overall objective of the background review and the cultural resources survey was to locate and assess
historic-age (50 years of age or older) properties or archeological sites listed or eligible for listing as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) within the APE
that could potentially be affected by Project construction. The following chapter provides information
regarding the sources consulted during the initial background review as well as the methods used during
the archeological survey.

2.1

Background Review Methods

Burns & McDonnell archeologists conducted an examination of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA) to identify previously recorded archeological sites and other previously designated historic-age
resources, including NRHP-listed properties and districts, SALs, National Historic Landmarks, historicage cemeteries, and Official State of Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), such as Recorded Texas
Historic Landmarks, within a Study Area extending 1 mile from the APE. The TASA was also used to
identify previous archeological surveys performed within the Study Area.
Additionally, the online Texas Geologic Map Data provided by U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), the
online Soil Web supplied by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and historic-age maps
available on the Texas Historic Overlay were reviewed (Foster et al. 2006). These resources were used to
identify high probability areas (HPAs) for previously unrecorded cultural resources within the APE.

2.2

Archeological Survey Methods

Survey was conducted along parallel transects spaced approximately 100 feet (30 m) apart. Shovel tests
were excavated at approximately 300-foot (100-m) intervals. Shovel tests were excavated to an average
depth of approximately 13.8 inches (35 centimeters [cm]) below surface (cmbs) in the clayey soils. Soil
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (0.65 cm) mesh when possible. Clayey matrices were handsorted and visually inspected. All shovel tests were backfilled immediately after inspection. Shovel test
locations were recorded using Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. The field survey was
performed in compliance with the ACT (Texas Natural Resources Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191, as
amended) and the guidelines set forth by the THC and the CTA. Artifacts identified during survey were
photographed and analyzed in the field but not collected. Analysis included descriptions of artifact type,
material, color, method of manufacture, decoration, maker’s marks, and any other potentially diagnostic
attributes. Artifact photographs included close-ups of diagnostic attributes. Project records and
photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING AND SOILS

Understanding the region’s natural environmental and geological development contextualizes the region’s
cultural history and the survey results. The environment greatly influenced past human subsistence and
behavioral patterns and conversely, the environment has been significantly impacted through human
intervention. This section discusses the physiography, geology, soils, vegetation, and fauna of the Study
Area.

3.1

Physiography

Hunt County is located in the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion of northcentral Texas. It is generally
characterized by its rolling hills, finely textured clayey soils, and natural prairie vegetation (Griffith et al.
2017). Approximately 300 miles of the Blackland Prairie expands from Sherman to San Antonio.
Historically, this region was dominated by a vast expanse of tallgrass prairie vegetation shaped by natural
fires and grazing bison; fires suppressed invading vegetative species, while bison spread tallgrass prairie
seed through consumption (Griffith et al. 2017). During the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
farming altered the natural landscape by replacing natural vegetation with commercially produced cotton,
wheat, and corn. As a result, tallgrass prairie communities and forested bottomlands were cleared, altering
the landscape. Today, much of the region is characterized by agricultural, urban, and industrial
development. Very little remains of the native Blackland Prairie.

3.2

Geology and Soils

Geologically, the Project is situated on the Neylandville Marl Formation between the Austin Chalk
Formation to the west and the Wilcox Group to the east. The Neylandville Marl Formation includes Late
Cretaceous-age mudstone and claystone that form the irregular topography of the region. Soils within the
proposed APE are mapped as Crockett loam, Ferris-Heiden complex, Heiden clay, Hopco silt loam,
Kaufman clay, Leson clay, and Wilson silt loam (NRCS 2018) (Figure 3-1). Crockett, Ferris-Heiden, and
Leson series soils formed in residuum derived from weathered Cretaceous shale (U. S. Department of
Agriculture [USDA] 2018). Wilson series soils formed in Pleistocene alluvium (USDA 2018). Cultural
deposits in these pre-Holocene soils, if present, are unlikely to be deeply buried. The Hopco and Kaufman
series soils mapped along Farber Branch and Mustang Creeks are derived from recent alluvium (USDA
2018). These soils have the potential to contain deeply buried cultural deposits.

Results of the Background Review

Vegetation and Fauna

Natural vegetation of the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion includes grasses such as little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum
nutans), and tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper). Historically, hardwood trees dominated areas surrounding
creeks, natural levees, and low terraces including bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), Shumard oak (Quercus
shumardii), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), elm (Ulmus spp.), ash (Fraxinus spp.), eastern cottonwood
(Populus deltoides), and pecan (Carya illinoinensis) (Griffith et al. 2017).
The modern development of the prairie has drastically changed the landscape, consequently impacting
native fauna populations. Before modern development, animal species included bison (Bison bison),
pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana), mountain lion (Puma concolor), bobcat (Lynx fufus), ocelot
(Leopardus pardalis), black bear (Ursus americanus), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), American badger (Taxidea
taxus), and river otter (Lontra canadensis). After modern development, larger fauna gave way to smaller
fauna such as the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), northern raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote, and
Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) (Griffith et al. 2017).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

Cultural Overview

Hunt County is located in the Prairie-Savanna Archaeological Region of the Eastern Planning Region of
Texas as delineated by the Texas Historical Commission (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Archaeological
evidence supports the continued presence of indigenous populations from Paleoindian times through the
Historic period. The generally accepted cultural history of the area is divided into four periods: the
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. Each of these periods is briefly summarized below.

4.1.2

Paleoindian Period

The Paleoindian period (10, 000-7000 B.P.) was commonly characterized throughout Texas by nomadic
big-game hunters who relied heavily on Pleistocene megafauna (bison, camel, horse, mammoth, and
mastodon) for subsistence. However, archaeological evidence suggests small and medium game (turtle,
rabbit, squirrel, snakes, gopher, and deer) played a larger role in the subsistence base of nomadic
Paleoindian hunters and gatherers (Bousman et al. 1990). Despite the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna,
Paleoindian populations increased from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene (Bousman et al. 1990)
Paleoindian sites in northeast Texas are not well understood, as Paleoindian artifacts frequently occur as
isolated finds or are excavated from mixed contexts. Paleoindian diagnostics found in northeast Texas
include Clovis, Scottsbluff, San Patrice, Dalton, and Meserve points, as well as Dalton adzes, Albany
scrapers, and Red River knives (Story 1990; Turner and Hester 1999).

4.1.3

Archaic Period

The Archaic period (7000 B.P. -700 A.D.) can be further subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods based on changes observed in the archeological record that appear to coincide with episodic shifts
in the Holocene climate and environment. Faunal and macrobotanical remains indicate a continuation of
the Paleoindian hunting and gathering subsistence strategy throughout the Archaic. However, Archaic lithic
technologies appear to show an increased diversity of functional types and styles over those associated with
the Paleoindian period. Decreases in the level of craftsmanship and the use of fine exotic materials in the
Late Archaic suggest reduced mobility or more tightly defined territories (Story 1990). Early and Middle
archaic diagnostic points include Johnson, Wells, Bulverde, Morrill, Carrollton, Dawson, Neches River,
and Motley. Late Archaic types are Yarbrough, Elam, Ellis, Edgewood, Kent, and Gary (Turner and Hester
1999).

4.1.4

Results of the Background Review

Late Historic Period

The Late Prehistoric period (A.D.700-1700) is defined by significant changes in subsistence and
technology, including the introduction of horticulture, ceramics, and the bow and arrow. The Late
Prehistoric sees the development of the Caddo culture in Northeast Texas, as well as adjacent areas of
Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Caddo ceramics have been found in small numbers in Hunt County.
The Caddo raised maize and other cultigens but hunting continued to be an important subsistence practice
(Pertulla 1990). Mound building and burial practices reflect an established social hierarchy (Pertulla 1990).
Diagnostic lithic artifacts from the first half of the Late Prehistoric include Scallorn, Alba, Steiner and
Catahoula arrow points. Later arrow point types include Washita, Harrell and Fresno (Turner and Hester
1999).

4.1.5

Historic Period

Permanent Euro-American settlement in present-day Hunt County did not occur until the 1830s, though
some earlier Mexican-era land grants encompassed portions of the area. The region remained sparsely
settled through the Texas Republic and early Statehood periods. When Hunt County was formed in 1846,
it contained an estimated 350 residents. The population remained small through the antebellum period
despite county lands that were well suited to cotton agriculture. Instead, the county’s early settlers were
primarily independent yeoman farmers who did not engage in commercial cultivation. Specifically, the
region’s isolated nature and lack of viable transportation networks such as navigable waterways or
railroads ensured that though slavery existed, it did not manifest itself in the plantation economy seen in
other parts of Texas prior to the Civil War (Harper 2016).
After the turmoil and unrest of the Civil War and subsequent Reconstruction periods, railroad
construction in the county prompted demographic and agricultural development. By the mid-1870s,
railroad connections were available throughout the region, and the East Line and Red River Railroad
arrived in Greenville, the county seat, in 1880. By 1904, “seven rail lines crossed some part of the county,
and eleven railroad towns of varying sizes were providing farmers facilities for shipping their crops.” This
ready market access meant that the region developed an increasing dependence on cotton agriculture
during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries accompanied by a reliance on tenant and
sharecropper labor to operate the farms of absentee landowners (Harper 2016). At the same time, small
Study Area communities bypassed by the railroad, including Wieland and Van Sickle, were almost
abandoned during the early twentieth century as the population concentrated along railroad corridors.

Results of the Background Review

The advent of the railroad and success of the cotton industry between 1860 and 1900 caused the county’s
population to increase from approximately 6,600 to over 47,000. Similarly, cotton production during the
same period increased from 22 bales in 1860 to over 50,000 bales 40 years later. Most of this cotton was
produced by farmers who did not own their land. As early as 1880, 31 percent of county farmers were
tenants or sharecroppers. This number increased to more than 58 percent by 1900, and at the advent of the
Great Depression, over 70 percent of Hunt County farmers “tilled land they did not own” (Harper 2016).
Due to the large numbers of tenant laborers residing in the county, the region was hit particularly hard by
the Great Depression. By 1930, the value of county farms was approximately half of the 1920 value, and
the number of county farms decreased by almost 1,500 by 1940 as tenants and sharecroppers were forced
off the land (Harper 2016). World War II signaled the beginning of a perceptible shift in the county’s
economic character. In general, the post-World War II era in Hunt County and the Study Area was
characterized by agricultural diversification and a shift to owner occupation of farms. Industry also
became important during this period, “with clothing and aeronautics manufacturers leading the way”
(Harper 2016). Today many area residents commute to the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, though the
Study Area itself remains predominantly rural in character.

RESULTS OF THE BACKGROUND REVIEW

Based on review of TASA, only one previous cultural resource survey (#8400007220) has been
performed within the Study Area (Figure 5-1). The survey was conducted in 1987 for the Federal
Highway Administration. No additional information about this survey was available on the TASA, and
the survey does not intersect with the current APE.

Results of the Background Review

One OTHM and three historic-age cemeteries were identified within the Study Area (Figure 5-1). The
OTHM commemorates William Lane, the first Anglo-American settler in Hunt County and a Confederate
soldier. The OTHM is mis-plotted on the TASA and should be within Mt. Bethel Church Cemetery at
William Lane’s headstone. Mt. Bethel Church Cemetery has over 700 interments dating from the late
nineteenth century to the present. Memoryland Memorial Park has over 6,000 interments from the early
twentieth century to present. Boyle Cemetery contains seven marked graves of the Boyle family. The
earliest interment is from 1899 and the most recent is from 2013 (Armstrong 2004). No previously
recorded cultural resources were identified within the proposed APE during the background review.
The review of historic-age maps and aerial photographs identified six high historic probability areas
(HHPAs) (Figure 5-2). HHPAs are areas where historic-age buildings or structures are/were located. Four
buildings were identified on the 1962 USGS Greenville SW and Greenville SE 7.5-inch Topographic
Quadrangles and the remaining two were identified on the 1930 USDA Hunt County Soils Map (Foster et
al. 2006).

RESULTS OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

The following section outlines the results of the archeology survey of the approximately 5-mile (72-acre)
APE including six HHPAs identified during the background review (Appendix A: Figure A-1). Burns &
McDonnell archeologists performed the intensive survey between November 26 and 29, 2018. Burns &
McDonnell archeologists excavated 173 shovel tests within the APE (Appendix A: Figure A-1; Appendix
C). Two new archeological sites (sites 41HU92 and 41HU93) were recorded. Ground surface visibility
was generally less than 10 percent within the grass and mixed-woods pastureland and 80 percent or
greater within the recently plowed fields (Figure 6-1 through Figure 6-5). Disturbances within the APE
included urban development (pavement, mechanical modification of landforms, clearing, buried and
raised utilities) and agricultural modifications (terraced slopes, stock tank construction, cattle trampling).
Shovel tests were excavated along two transects approximately every 300 feet (100 m) within the APE
(Appendix A: Figure A-4). Shovel tests revealed very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clays extending to 60 cmbs.
Most soils were Blackland Prairie clays with few areas of potential alluvium. Two archeological sites
were observed during the survey. Additional shovel tests were excavated to delineate the boundaries of
sites 41HU92 and 41HU93 within the APE.

Results of the Archeological Survey

The APE crosses two alluvial soils both mapped by the NRCS (2018) and encountered by shovel testing.
The Kaufman series is a very deep, moderately well drained clayey alluvium derived from mudstone
located on floodplains of river valleys and dissected plains. The Kaufman series is located on the western
portion of the APE around Farber Creek. The Hopco series is a deep, poorly drained silty clay loam
formed in recent alluvium and found on floodplains (NRCS 2018). This soil is located on the eastern
portion of the APE around Mustang Branch. Both these documented Holocene-age soils have the
potential for deeply buried archaeological deposits. Given the Project designs, archeological trenching
prior to construction is not feasible as it would compromise the integrity of soil required to support
structure locations. Instead, Burns & McDonnell recommends archeological monitoring of the foundation
excavations at these locations.

6.1

Site 41HU92

Site 41HU92 is the remains of an early to mid-twentieth century farmstead (Figure 6-6 and Figure 6-7;
Figure 6-8 through Figure 6-11). The site measures approximately 55 feet (17 m) west-to-east by 320 feet
(98 m) north-to-south and is in two loci: the southern locus consists of a surficial scatter of primarily glass
and ceramic artifacts on an eroding slope vegetated with tall grass and juniper. The second locus consists
of ornamental plants (Figure 6-12) and the remnants of a brick chimney in a hackberry woods
immediately south of a plowed field. The roof of a collapsed/demolished barn was observed just outside
the APE to the west. The site is entirely surficial.

Twelve shovel tests were excavated to delineate the site, all of which were negative for cultural material.
Shovel tests revealed compact very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clays. Shovel tests were terminated at
35 cmbs in the compact Blackland Prairie clay. Glass artifacts observed on the surface in the southern
locus included a solarized amethyst glass bottle base with bubble inclusions; a cobalt glass jar base
embossed with a single triangle surrounded by the words “VICKS/VAPORUB”; approximately 15
additional cobalt glass shards; approximately 30 milk glass shards; 30 colorless glass shards; 5 aqua glass
shards; and 5 amber glass shards (Figure 6-13 through Figure 6-19). Ceramic artifacts included
approximately 50 whiteware sherds including 1 partial maker’s mark, 5 stoneware sherds, and 1 terra
cotta sherd (Figure 6-20 through Figure 6-24). Other artifacts included 1 piece of crushed aluminum, 1
piece of possible vulcanized rubber or black glass, and 1 piece of possible slag or lignite (Figure 6-25
through Figure 6-28). Solarized amethyst glass was mainly produced between 1890 and 1920 when the
manganese that gives it the amethyst hue was phased out due to World War I (SHA 2018). The Vick’s
VapoRub base dates to the mid-twentieth century (post-1930s to the 1970s when the company switched to
plastic bottles) (Whitten 2018). Milk glass jar lid liners were introduced ca. 1871, and milk glass was
commonly used in a wide variety of bottles and jars from the 1870s through the mid-twentieth century

(Lindsey 2018; Whitten 2015). The partial maker’s mark belongs to the Edwin M. Knowles China
Company and was manufactured sometime between 1930 and 1963 (Lehner 1988:237; DeBolt 1994:68–
70). The glass and ceramic artifacts suggest an early to mid-twentieth century domestic occupation of the
site.

The remnant mound of brick, feature H1, appears to be the ruins of a chimney with some stacked-in-place
(mortared) bricks measuring approximately 10 feet in diameter (Figure 6-29 and Figure 6-30). Two piles
of bricks are located around it; one approximately 30 feet southeast of the ruin, and one approximately 15
feet west of the ruin (Figure 6-31 through Figure 6-35). All bricks are in discrete piles (likely pushed)
with types including “PALMER,” “GROESBECK,” “CRUSH,” “GLOBE,” and “FERRIS” (see Figure
6-36 through Figure 6-40).

The Palmer Press Brick Company was established as a brick manufacturing plant in Palmer, Texas, in
1902. In 1929, the company was renamed Barron Brick Company (Minor 2018; WorthPoint Corporation
2018). This Barron Brick Company also produced the Groesbeck bricks out of Groesbeck, Texas
(Langston 2018). The Crush Brick Company was established in Crush, Texas, in 1910. By the 1940s, the
company and the town had changed their name to Thermo for the Thermo Fire Brick Company (Long
2018). Globe Press Brick Company filed as a Domestic For-Profit Corporation in Texas in November
1904. The company discontinued the manufacture of bricks in 1923 (Langston 2018; Sagewire Research
LLC 2018). The Ferris Brick Company was established in 1901 and was eventually purchased by
Reliance Clay Products, and then by Henderson Clay Products (Langston 2018); however, no date of
these purchases could be located. The bricks suggest the feature was constructed in the early twentieth
century.
Feature H2 represents the remnants of a collapsed/demolished barn located just outside the APE. It
consists of the barn’s roof and measures approximately 20 feet west-to-east by 15 feet north-to-south. It
features milled lumber with wire-cut nails (Figure 6-41). The 1962 USGS Greenville SW 7.5”
Topographic Quadrangle map depicts two buildings at the location (Appendix A: Figure A-5b) (Foster et
al. 2006). Historic-period aerial photographs from 1961 clearly show a house, an adjacent shed, as well as
a barn at the location of the ruins recorded at the site. The area is also part of a larger plowed field. By
1995, the buildings were no longer extant and the area was beginning to become wooded (NETR 2018).

6.1.1

Archival Research

Archival research indicates the property containing the site was owned by the Flesher family during the
early to mid-twentieth century and that they were likely associated with the creation of and occupation at
site 41HU92. The 135-acre tract containing site 41HU92 is part of the original 320-acre Luther D. Green
survey (Texas GLO Records; Hunt County Abstract 367). Green received the acreage as a homesteader in
the Charles Fenton Mercer Colony, but never settled there. Instead, the resident of Dallas County
transferred interest in the property to W.J.J. Breekeen in 1853, and Breekeen patented the property in
1860 (Texas GLO Records; Hunt County File No. 3476). No evidence exists that the latter ever occupied
the subject property.
A gap exists in the chain of title for the tract through the 1890s when E.B. and E.C. Hardie sold 87 acres
of the subject property to B.R. Womack. All the individuals were listed as residents of Hunt County, and
Womack paid $1,957 with a vendor’s lien for the property (Hunt County Deed Records), suggesting it
may have been improved at that time. Census records indicate Elias B. and Emily C. Hardie resided in the
town of Greenville with their children during this period where Elias worked as Baptist preacher. As a
result, any residents of the property during their tenure of ownership would have been tenants. B.R.
Womack was also a Baptist Preacher living in Greenville in 1900, although census records suggest a

relative and subsequent property owner, W.A. Womack, may have been renting the property during this
period.
W.A. Womack and wife Eva resided in an unincorporated portion of Hunt County in Justice Precinct 1 on
a rented farm in 1900. In that year, the household included William A. Womack (40), wife Eva (35), their
children Della (17), Edgar (14), Jesse (12), Andrew (9), Lela (6), Pearl (4), Mayble (1), and a
boarder/farm laborer Augustine A. Welch (24). Though no conveyance was found of record, the W.A.
and Eva Womack owned the 87-acre tract and another 47-acre tract (called 135 acres) in 1905 when they
conveyed the property to Henry Flesher, a resident of Collin County. The Womacks do not appear in the
1910 Hunt County census records and may have relocated after selling the property. Flesher paid $6,750
for the property with a vendor’s lien (Hunt County Deed Records; 137/559).
Census and deed records indicate the extended Flesher family occupied the property through at least the
mid-twentieth century and still own it at present. By 1910, the Flesher family had relocated to an
unincorporated part of Hunt County in Justice Precinct 1, likely the subject tract. In that year, the
household included Henry (60), his wife Louisa (53), their daughter Lillie (19), and Louisa’s 86-year-old
father, W.M. Elam. The family owned their farm along the Greenville and Terrell Road.
The family still lived in the same area in 1920, but the household had expanded to include Henry Flesher
(70), wife Louisa L. (63), their widowed daughter Lilly A. Surratt (24), granddaughter Hazel W. Surratt
(9), and their niece Ida A. Elgin (13). Henry is still identified as a property-owning farmer. The 1930
census indicates that several other members of the extended family had moved to the subject property,
though they are all listed as part of the same household. Henry Flesher (80) was still identified as the head
of a household including wife Louisa J. (73), their son William E. (54), daughter Lilli [sic.], A. Surratt
(39), granddaughter Hazel M. Surratt (17), sister-in-law Mary Smiley (77), and daughter Myrtie E.
Thomason (37) and her children Truman E. (18), Elwood F. (17), Aubry W. (15), and Madie M. (11).
Henry had no occupation that year, and his son William E. was running the farm. All of the adult children
are listed as renters, suggesting more than one dwelling may have occurred on the property by this time.
Cemetery inventory records indicate Henry Flesher died in 1930 (Armstrong 2002a). In 1940, his wife is
identified as owner of the subject property. The household included her son Will E. Flesher (64),
identified as a farmer; Louisa (83), listed as a property owner; and daughter Lillie Surratt (49). Louisa
died in 1949 (Armstrong 2002b), and the subject property entered probate the following year.
In January of 1950, the Flesher heirs, including Mrs. Lillie Surratt (widow) of Hunt County, W.E. Flesher
of Hunt County, Mrs. Ethel Thompson (widow) of Dallas County, G.W. and Artie Flesher of Collin

County, Lloyd and Ollie Sanstrom of Grayson County, Erwin Sanstrom of Grayson County, Lucile
Sanstrom of Tarrant County, and Selma and Jesse Hodge of Dallas County, conveyed the subject 135
acres containing Site 41HU92 to A.M. and Myrtle Flesher of Hunt County for $12,150 cash (Hunt County
Deed Records; 497/204). The couple retained the tract until 1970 when they conveyed the property to
their son Clifford Aldine Flesher and grandsons Frank Kirk Jones and James David Wall (Hunt County
Deed Records; 685/550). Wall owns the property at present.
Archival research supports the archeological evidence that Site 41HU92 is associated with an early to
mid-twentieth century occupation by the Womack and extended Flesher family. No evidence was found
to suggest that the occupants were significant to local historical development patterns or that the
associated site was associated with other important events, themes, or trends. As a result, it is not
recommended for NRHP inclusion under Criterion A or Criterion B.

6.1.2

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41HU92 is the remains of an early to mid-twentieth century farmstead with an associated surficial
artifact scatter. The site does not maintain integrity that would warrant NRHP listing under Criterion C
and lacks potential to provide significant information under NRHP Criterion D. Additionally, archival
research suggests the site was not associated with local or regionally significant individuals under NRHP
Criterion B or with broader patterns of historical development under NRHP Criterion A. Therefore, the
site is not recommended for NRHP inclusion, or for designation as a SAL within the current APE.
Portions of site 41HU92 outside the APE were not investigated and are therefore unevaluated for NRHP
and SAL eligibility.

6.2

Site 41HU93

Site 41HU93 is the remains of an early to mid-twentieth century farmstead. The site measures
approximately 315 feet (96 m) west-to-east by 85 feet (26 m) north-to-south and is located in a fallow
portion between a plowed corn field and two county roads (Hallmark Street to the west and Coyote
Crossing to the north) (Figure 6-42 and Figure 6-43). The site includes a surface scatter of mostly modern
trash, a well, destroyed chimney and brick scatter, and a standing barn. The site is situated on a plain
within a group of approximately 15 to 20-year-old hackberry trees and short grasses (Figure 6-44 and
Figure 6-45). Ornamental plants remain near the brick scatter (Figure 6-46).

Ten shovel tests were conducted to delineate the site, all of which were negative for cultural material.
Shovel tests revealed compact very black (10YR 2/1) clays to a depth of 40 cmbs. Shovel tests were
terminated due to the compact Blackland Prairie clay.
The brick well, feature H1, is open and still mostly intact (Figure 6-47 through Figure 6-50). The well is
bell shaped with the subsurface portion of the well much larger than the opening. The well appears to be
10 to 15 feet in diameter below surface and tapers to a 34-inch opening 18 inches above ground surface.
The remnant brick chimney, feature H2, consists of a small rectangular remnant, measuring
approximately 1.5-ft-wide by 1-ft-long (Figure 6-51 through Figure 6-53). Two brick scatters are located
immediately west and south of this remnant. All the bricks are marked with “ATLAS” (Figure 6-54). The
Atlas Press Brick Works was established in Ferris, Texas, and operated from 1895 to 1918 when it
merged with the Ferris Brick Company (Langston 2018).

Feature H3 is a standing barn which was once used to house livestock (Figure 6-55 through Figure 6-57).
The barn measures approximately 25-feet-wide and 20-feet-long with the pen opening to the south. The
barn appears to have been originally constructed of wood with a later addition of corrugated sheet metal
(Figure 6-59 and Figure 6-59). The three pens have low wooden toughs and a segregated room to the east
has a dirt floor and raised wooded platform leading to a back hallway (Figure 6-60). The north side of the
barn contains three equally sized rooms with wooden doors that open onto the raised wooden hallway
(Figure 6-61 and Figure 6-62). The barn was made of milled lumber with wire cut nails (Figure 6-63).
Both the well and the barn are in good condition; however, it appears the historically associated dwelling
was removed from the property in the late twentieth century.

Other surficial artifacts included several unidentifiable pieces of rolled metal, paint cans, amber glass beer
bottles (modern), modern agricultural equipment, large empty plastic jugs, and three pull-tab/ring-pull
beer cans (Figure 6-64 and Figure 6-65). The pull-tab/ring-pull style of beer cans was produced between
1965 and 1983 (Maxwell 1993). Other than the beer cans, no other diagnostic artifacts that could be
possibly associated with the structures were found. Much of the site contains modern garbage from both
the adjacent roads and agricultural activities.

The 1962 USGS Greenville SW 7.5-inch Topographic Quadrangle map depicts one building at the
location (Appendix A: Figure A-6b) (Foster et al. 2006). Historic-period aerial photographs from 1961
clearly show a house, an adjacent shed, and a barn at the location of the ruins recorded at the site. The site
is also part of a larger plowed field. By the 1995 aerial, the house and shed were no longer extant and
vegetation was beginning to take over the site (NETR 2018).

6.2.1

Archival Research

Archival research indicates the property containing site 41HU93 was associated with the Norton family
during the early to mid-twentieth century. The family may have briefly occupied the property, but
secondary sources suggest it may have been used for farm and stock raising by the family and could have
been occupied by tenants during the period.
The 121.296-acre tract containing the site is part of the original 229-acre James Lynch Survey patented by
Vincent S. Payne in 1859 (Texas General Land Office Records; Hunt County Abstract 617). Despite gaps
in the early history of the property, by the late nineteenth century, the tract containing the site was owned
by “landlords” G.P. Mitchell and Y.O. McAdams. Both men lived in Greenville and owned several
parcels throughout the county. In 1895 and 1896, the men conveyed two tracts containing the subject
property to F.H. Norton, a resident of Hunt County (Hunt County Deed Records; 87/256 and 398/181).

Garland Power & Light

The conveyances included 167 acres in the Robert Montgomery and James Lynch surveys for $2,271 with
a vendor’s lien and 2.18 acres in the Lynch survey for $50. Both transactions included vendor’s liens.
In 1900, Felix H. Norton and his family lived in an unincorporated portion of Justice Precinct #1 in Hunt
County. The household included Felix (45), wife Barbara (41), and their children William F. (21), Jesse
A. (20), Nat. B. (15), Roy (13), Edna (10), and Eugene (7). The oldest sons were identified as farm
laborers, and Felix is identified as a property-owning farmer. The family likely lived on the subject
property during his period.
By 1910, the family had relocated to West Cornelia Street in Greenville. Norton was identified as the
owner of a grocery store, and the household included Felix H. (56), Barbara A. (52), and their son E.
Harris (14). Cemetery inventory records indicate Felix Norton died of a sudden illness in 1913, and his
obituary indicates he had continued to engage in farming and stock raising after moving to the city
(Armstrong 2002c), likely on the subject property. No entry for Barbara was found in the 1920 Hunt
County census, but in 1930, she lived in her daughter Annie Renfro’s household in Greenville. The
household included Annie Renfro (48), her son Derwood (20), and Barbara Norton (71). They lived on
Division Street. Annie worked as a saleswoman in a department store, and her son worked as a salesman
at a Gulf filling station. No other census entries for Barbara Norton were found of record, and cemetery
inventory records indicate she died in 1952 and was buried in the East Mound Cemetery in Greenville
(Armstrong 2002d).
The extended family retained the subject parcel until 1966 when the heirs, including J.A. Norton of Hunt
County, Florence Smith (widow) of Hunt County, Johnnie Norton of Hunt County, Gertrude Norton Craft
of Hunt County, Edna Hayter of Hunt County, Willie Fletcher (widow) of Fresno County, California,
Annie Kate and Leonard Davis of Harris County, Virgil Norton of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma,
Elizabeth Ann and R.L. Gantt of Moore County, Oklahoma, Clorine and C.B. Williams of Potter County,
Vee Norton (widow) of Potter County, and Roy Norton of Dallas County, conveyed the subject property
to Ben E. Becker of Dallas County for $22,000 (Hunt County Deed Records; 610/164). The property
remains part of a larger ranching trust at present.
Archival research supports the archeological data that site 41HU93 was associated with an early- to midtwentieth century occupation by the Norton family or associated tenants. Though tenant farmers are an
underrepresented group in the archival record, the paucity of the artifacts and lack of features negates its
potential to provide information about these individuals. No indication exists that the Norton family were
particularly significant to local development patterns, and the site maintains no known associations with

other significant events, trends, or themes. It is not recommended for NRHP inclusion under Criterion A
or Criterion B.

6.2.2

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41HU93 is the remains of a mid-twentieth century farmstead with an associated surficial artifact
scatter. The site does not maintain integrity that would warrant NRHP listing under Criterion C and lacks
potential to provide significant information under NRHP Criterion D. Additionally, archival research
suggests the site was not associated with local or regionally significant individuals under NRHP Criterion
B or with broader patterns of historical development under NRHP Criterion A. Therefore, the site is not
recommended for NRHP inclusion, or for designation as a SAL.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Due to landowner restrictions, survey of three non-contiguous parcels was denied during the initial
archeological survey, thus the archeological survey was conducted over two mobilizations. The
background review and initial archeological survey was completed between November 26 and 29, 2018
and consisted of 4.98 miles (8.01 km), 72.4 acres of the total APE. During the initial survey two
archeological sites were recorded, sites 41HU92 and 41HU93. Both sites represent the remnants of early
to mid-twentieth century farmsteads. Based on the data recorded during the survey and archival research,
Burns & McDonnell recommends 41HU92 as not eligible for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation within
the APE and 41HU93 as not eligible for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation.
The subsequent survey consisted of remaining 0.72 miles (1.1 km), 10.5 acres of the APE and was
conducted on August 15, 2019. During the subsequent survey one archeological site was recorded,
41HU95. Site 41HU95 represents the remnants of an early-to-mid-twentieth century homestead. Based on
the data recorded during the survey and archival research, Burns & McDonnell recommends site 41HU95
as not eligible for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation.
Burns & McDonnell conducted archeological monitoring of structure construction in the areas around
Farber Creek and Mustang Branch which are associated with the Kaufman and Hopco soil series and
which contain the potential for deeply buried deposits. Archeological monitoring was conducted between
September 20, 2019 and November 11, 2019. Detailed results of the monitoring are provided in Appendix
E of this report. No cultural materials were observed during archeological monitoring.
No artifacts were collected during survey or monitoring. Project records and photograph will be curated at
TARL. No further consideration of impacts to historic properties under Section 106 of the NHPA or the
Antiquities Code of Texas is recommended in association with the Project.

Appendix D

INTRODUCTION

The following Addendum provides the results of an archeological survey competed on August 15, 2019
of three non-contiguous parcels for which access was previously denied on Garland Power & Light
(GP&L) Dent Road to Shelby 138-kilovolt (kV) Transmission Line (Project) in the city of Greenville,
Hunt County, Texas. GP&L contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns &
McDonnell) to perform a background review and archeological survey for the Project. The Project will be
constructed under Nationwide Permit 12, Utility Lines without requirement for a pre-construction
notification to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Additionally, the proposed Project is funded by GP&L,
a not-for-profit municipal utility owned by the City of Garland, a political subdivision of the State of
Texas. Therefore, compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) is required. The remainder of the
Project was surveyed in November 2018 and the Texas Historical Commission concurred with the results
and recommendations of these investigation on August 29, 2019. Additional information about the
Project, including a complete Project description, research design, environmental and cultural setting, and
result of the previous investigations can be found in the report chapters preceding this appendix.
The three non-contiguous parcels discussed in this addendum total 0.72 miles (1.1 kilometers [km]), 10.5
acres of the total 5.7 miles (9.2 kilometers [km])-long, 82.9-acre proposed 138-kV power lines within
GP&L’s proposed 120-foot (36.6-meters [m]) wide easement. The survey was conducted under
Antiquities Permit #8622. One new historic-age archeological site, 41HU95, was recorded during the
survey.

1.1

Project History and Personnel

Burns & McDonnell archeologists Dan Rodriguez and Shelly Wunderlich conducted an archeological
survey of the three parcels on August 15, 2019. Archival research of 41HU95 was conducted by Burns &
McDonnell Senior Historian Brandy Harris and Staff Cultural Resources Specialist Jessica Kepka
conducted the artifact analysis.

RESULTS

Survey was conducted along two parallel transects spaced approximately 100 feet (30 meters [m]) apart.
Shovel tests were excavated at approximately 300-foot (100-m) intervals. Burns & McDonnell
archeologists excavated 30 shovel tests within the APE ( Figure 2-1 through Figure 2-3; Attachment 1:
Table D-1). Shovel tests were excavated from 4 to 16 inches (10 to 40 centimeters) below surface in the
clayey soils. Clayey matrices were hand-sorted and visually inspected. All shovel tests were backfilled
immediately after inspection. Shovel test locations were recorded using Global Positioning System (GPS)
equipment.

The northernmost parcel was a mature sorghum/milo field that had been partially cleared within the
proposed ROW (Figure 2-5). Ground surface visibility was poor. Shovel tests revealed very compact,
dark gray silty clay/clay at the surface. No artifacts or cultural features were observed. The central parcel
was a recently harvested wheat field with less than 10 percent ground surface visibility (Figure 2-6).
Shovel tests revealed 30 to 40 cm grayish brown to very dark brown clay loam over compact clay. No
artifacts or cultural features were observed. The southernmost parcel was pasture with medium tall
grasses and a grove of trees. One new historic-age archeological site, 41HU95, was recorded in the woods
(Figure 2-7).

2.1

Site 41HU95

Site 41HU95 is the remnants of an early-to-mid-twentieth century homestead. Architectural features at the
site included a collapsed building, a collapsed brick chimney, collapsed concrete stairs, and an
unidentified concrete feature with hackberry tree growing through it (Figure 2-8 and Figure 2-9). The
collapsed building was a pile of lumber with machine-made nails and PVC pipe mixed with branches and
other debris (Figure 2-10). No evidence of a foundation or other substructure was observed. The pile may
have been pushed from another location and may not represent the original location of the building. The
collapsed 2-step concrete stairs may also be displaced from their original location (Figure 2-11). The
collapsed brick chimney appears to be in situ and includes a scatter of fallen bricks extending
approximately 8 m to the south (Figure 2-12). The unidentifiable concrete feature may be the remnants of
a second set of stairs (Figure 2-13). Other features included a large trash midden approximately 10 m in
diameter and a circular depression approximately 4 m in diameter (Figure 2-14 and Figure 2-15). A
sample of diagnostic artifacts from the midden were photographed. No artifacts were collected.

Artifacts

Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the midden include a cobalt pharmaceutical or hygienic jar, a milk
glass deodorant jar, a green Coca-Cola bottle base, an amber beer bottle, a Fanta soda bottle, a Max
Factor bottle, and a Veterans Administration (VA) plate. The cobalt jar has a circle “M” mark of the
Maryland Glass Corporation and stippling on the base (Figure 2-16). The mark in combination with
stippling indicates the jar was produced between 1940 and 1971 (Bottle Research Group 2019; Lindsey
2019). The milk glass deodorant jar contained a product of the Bristol-Myers Company, which produced
Ban and Mum deodorants (Figure 2-17). The company acquired Mum deodorant in 1931 and continued
adding various other anti-perspirant products, including Ban, through the 1970s (Bennett 2016). The
green Coca-Cola bottle base feature the famous “hobble skirt” design, patented in 1915, and the circle
“C” mark of the Chattanooga Glass Company (Figure 2-18 and Figure 2-19) (Market Street Media LLC
2016). The “C” mark was in use from 1927 to 1987 (Bottle Research Group 2019). The amber beer bottle
appears to be embossed “NO DEPOSIT, NO RETURN, NOT TO BE REFILLED,” which was a Federal
requirement on beer bottles 1934 to 1963 (Figure 2-20) (Thompson and Baker 2012). The green Fanta
bottle features applied color labeling (Figure 2-21) (ACL). ACL was invented in the 1920s but first
offered on milk and soda bottles beginning in 1933 with widespread acceptance occurring circa 1935 and
later (Lindsey 2019). The Max Factor bottle features a decorative tree design on the bottle and lists their
offices in Hollywood, London, and Paris (Figure 2-22). Max Factor was founded in Hollywood in 1908
and added their London agency in 1928 and Paris in 1937 (Bennett 2016). The Veterans Administration
(VA) plate sherd postdates 1930, the inception of the VA (Figure 2-23) (U.S. Department of Veteran
Affairs 2019). Artifacts suggest the site was likely occupied from the 1930s to the 1960s.

Map Research

Buildings first appear at the location of 41HU95 on the 1934 Hunt County Soils Map (USDA 1934). In
that year, a dwelling is depicted in the vicinity of the site. The dwelling is still visible on the 1962
Greenville Southwest Quadrangle (USGS 1962), and a 1961 aerial photograph depicts the dwelling and at
least two associated outbuildings on the property. The farm complex was gone by 1981 (NETR var.).

2.1.3

Archival Research

Archival research indicates the property containing 41HU95 was associated with the Harris family during
the late nineteenth and very early twentieth centuries. The family may have occupied the larger property
historically containing the site, though there is no archaeological evidence that the site itself dates from
their period of occupation. After 1912, the property was associated with the extended Bowman family.
The artifacts and architectural remnants at the site appear to be from the period in which the Bowmans
owned the property; however, sources indicate that the family never resided at this location. As a result,
41HU95 may be associated with occupation of the property by tenants during the Bowmans’ tenure of
ownership.
The 27.29-acre tract containing the site is part of the original 229-acre James Lynch Survey patented by
Vincent S. Payne in 1859 (Texas General Land Office Records; Hunt County Abstract 617). Despite gaps
in the early history of the property, in 1912, the tract containing the site was owned by the widow Mrs.
M.A. Harris. In that year, Harris conveyed the then 70-acre parcel, including 66.15 acres in the Lynch
Survey and 3.85 acres from the adjacent Samuel Ussery Survey, to L.L. Bowman for $1,617.40 (Hunt
County Deed Records; 187: 483).
Census records indicate the Harris family did not reside on the property until the latter part of the
nineteenth century. In 1880, William J. Harris (40) appears as the head of a household in a rural portion of
Precinct 4 in Collin County census records. Collin County is located approximately 20 miles west of Hunt
County, the location of the subject parcel. The record indicates he worked as a farmer, and his household
included wife Mary A. (37) and their children William G. (15), Nannie C. (11), Minnie L. (10), Alice M.
(8), Jasper A. (5), Walter J. (3), and Francis C. (6 months). No census records are available for 1890, but
in 1900, the family are recorded as residents of Justice Precinct 1 in Hunt County. They resided one
household from the Felix Norton family, who occupied a residence associated with nearby site 41HU93
during that time period (Rodriguez et al. 2019FA). In 1900, the household included William Harris (59),
Mary A. (57), their children Joseph E. (25), Francis E. (21), James H. (18), Annie M. (14), and Man (12),
as well as a 57-year-old boarder named John H. Meeks. The record identifies Harris, his oldest sons, and
Meeks as farmers. Harris owned his property, and the other men are identified as renters.

Appendix D

William Harris died in October of 1900 and was buried in the Bethel Cemetery in Greenville (Unknown
2006). In 1910, M.A. Harris, widow, appears as head of a household in Justice Precinct 1. The then-66year-old is described as a property-owning farmer, and the household included her two adult sons F.E.
(30) and Mann (22). Her son James H. and his family rented a neighboring farm. In 1912, M.A. Harris
conveyed the 70 acres containing 41HU95 to L.L. Bowman and his wife for $1,617.40 with a vendor’s
lien (Hunt County Deed Records; 187: 483). This conveyance correlates with Mary Harris’s
disappearance from the census records in 1920. She was buried next to her husband in the Bethel
Cemetery in 1926 (Unknown 2006).
Although they resided in Hunt County, L.L. Bowman and his family appear to have purchased the
property containing 41HU95 as an investment, and archival research suggests they never resided on the
land. In 1917, just five years after their purchase, Bowman and his wife conveyed the entire 70 acres to
the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company of Boston, Massachusetts, through a deed of trust
(Hunt County Deed Records; 104: 224). Within the deed, the couple avowed “that the herein described
property is not our homestead, nor claimed, used, occupied nor enjoyed by us as such and that we have
other property situated in Greenville, Hunt Co., Texas, which we occupy and claim only as our
homestead" (Hunt County Deed Records; 104: 224). Neither active tenants nor the general right to lease
the property are mentioned in the deed, but the approximate date of architectural remnants at 41HU95
nevertheless suggest that improvements were made during the twentieth century and the Bowmans’
tenure of ownership.
Lucius Linton Bowman was a relatively prominent figure within Greenville, the county seat of Hunt
County, in the early twentieth century. He served at the City Attorney from 1902 to 1908 and composed
the city charter in 1906. He next served as district attorney to the Eighth Judicial District, and in 1930, he
was elected judge (Texas A&M Special Collections Department n.d.). In 1920 Hunt County census
records, Bowman (47) is identified as a resident of Greenville with his wife Mary M. Bowman (46); their
children Lucius L. (20), Mary Rives (18), and Edith V. (13); and his mother-in-law Mattie A. Murff (76).
In 1930, Lucius L. (57) and Mary M. (56) Bowman lived only with their daughters Mary R. (28) and
Edith V. (23). Their son Lucius Bowman, Jr. (30), also a lawyer, was recorded at a separate Greenville
residence with his wife Lenna K. (28) and son Linton L. (1).
Judge Lucius L. Bowman died testate in 1933, and his wife Mary died testate in 1959. Both are buried in
East Mount Cemetery in Greenville (Unknown 2004). An affidavit of heirship produced by Lucius L.
Bowman, Jr., in 1963 asserts that the couple’s inheritance and state taxes were paid in full upon their

death and names three living heirs: Lucius Bowman, Jr., Mary Rives Bowman, and Edith (Bowman)
Wilbanks (Hunt County Public Records; 611: 275).
The property containing 41HU95 does not appear again in Hunt County Deed Records until 1973, at
which time it was in possession of Mary Rives Bowman, Edith (Bowman) Wilbanks, and Lenna Kate
Bowman, the widow of Lucius Bowman, Jr. On December 14, 1973, the Bowman sisters and their sisterin-law conveyed 28.046 acres (including 41HU95) of the formerly 70-acre parcel to A. Starke Taylor III
for $10.00 cash in hand plus a promissory note for $65,505.60. The total acreage included 0.752 acres
within the limits of an existing county road, and the deed specified that the public were to retain rights to
access this road. (Hunt County Deed Records; 740: 157).
Three days after purchasing the property from the Bowmans, A. Starke Taylor III conveyed the 28.046
acres to Don V. Ingram for $10 cash in hand, plus one promissory note for $7,500.00 bearing interest and
maturing in 1993 and another promissory note for $50,000 bearing interest and maturing in 1974 (Hunt
County Deed Records; 740: 173). The property remains in Ingram’s ownership as of mid-2019 and
maintains a calculated acreage of 27.29 acres (roughly 28.046 acres less the 0.752 acre within the
roadway).

2.1.4

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41HU95 is an early-to-mid-twentieth century homestead and associated trash midden. The site was
likely occupied by tenants of the Bowman family, who owned the property from 1912 to 1973. Due to the
ubiquitous nature of the artifacts, lack of integrity of architectural features, and lack of potential to gain
additional information about the former occupants, site 41HU95 does not appear have the potential to
provide additional information about regional history. Site 41HU95 is recommended not eligible for
NRHP inclusion or SAL designation.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The archeological survey three non-contiguous parcels for which access was previously denied on GP&L
Dent Road to Shelby 138- kV Transmission Line Project was completed on August 15, 2019. One new
archeological site, 41HU95, was recorded. Site 41HU95 is the remnants of an early-to-mid-twentieth
century homestead. Site 41HU95 does not appear have the potential to provide additional information
about regional history. It is not recommended eligible for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation. As a
result, no further consideration of impacts to historic resources under the Antiquities Code of Texas is
recommended in association with the surveyed portions of the proposed Project.
Burns & McDonnell also recommends archeological monitoring of pole construction in the areas around
Farber Creek and Mustang Branch which are associated with the Kaufman and Hopco soil series and
which contain the potential for deeply buried deposits. The results of these investigations will be
submitted to the THC as an appendix to this report. If significant cultural resources are encountered
during the monitoring or previously unidentified cultural resources are encountered during construction or
work would cease in the immediate area and GP&L would contact the THC to consult on further actions
that may be necessary to protect the cultural remains. CaCO3

INTRODUCTION

The following Addendum provides the results of archeological monitoring conducted between September
20, 2019 and November 11, 2019 of eight structure locations on Garland Power & Light’s (GP&L) Dent
Road to Shelby 138-kV (kV) Transmission Line (Project) in the city of Greenville, Hunt County, Texas
(Figure 1-1 through Figure 1-3). GP&L contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc.
(Burns & McDonnell) to perform a background review and archeological survey for the Project. Burns &
McDonnell recommended archeological monitoring of pole construction in the areas around Farber Creek
and Mustang Branch which contain the potential for deeply buried deposits. The Project was constructed
under Nationwide Permit 12, Utility Lines without requirement for pre-construction notification to the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Additionally, the proposed Project is funded by GP&L, a not-for-profit
municipal utility owned by the City of Garland, a political subdivision of the State of Texas. Therefore,
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) is required. The survey and monitoring were
conducted under Antiquities Permit #8622. The archeological survey of the Project was completed on
August 15, 2019 and the Texas Historical Commission concurred with the results and recommendations
of these investigations on October 4, 2019. Additional information regarding the Project, including a
complete Project description, research design, environmental and cultural setting, and the results of the
archeological survey can be found in the report chapters and appendices preceding this appendix.

RESEARCH DESIGN

Archeological Monitoring Methods

Prior to construction, Burns & McDonnell archeologists identified areas with the potential to contain
deeply buried cultural deposits. These areas are located adjacent to Faber Creek and Mustang Creek
which are associated with the Kaufman and Hopco soil series. Archeological monitoring was conducted
during the excavation of eight structure locations within the identified areas. Monopole structures were
installed using drilled pier foundations or direct embed method, depending on the structure location. New
structure foundation shafts were mechanically excavated to depths ranging from 20 feet (6.1 meters [m])
and 58 feet (17.7 m) below the surface and a diameter ranging from 6 feet (1.8 m) to 12 feet (3.7 m).
However, archeological monitoring was only conducted on the upper 15 feet (4.6 m) of soil, where
archeological deposits would be expected to occur. Depth and diameter of foundation shafts were
contingent on the height of the structure and structure location. Soil matrices from each new foundation
location were visually examined to identify cultural material impacted during excavation. Side walls of
each new foundation shaft were visually inspected, within safety limits, to document stratigraphic
profiles.
Stratigraphic profiles were divided into “zones”, when pedologic features could be differentiated. Due to
the depth of the foundation shafts, precise zone boundaries could not be determined. Zone boundaries
were limited to gross determinations based on the observation of excavated soil and visual inspection of
foundation shaft side walls. Digital photographs and notes were recorded during the excavation of each
new foundation shaft, and soil color was recorded using Munsell Soil Color Charts.

RESULTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION MONITORING

A Burns & McDonnell archeologist monitored excavation of eight structure locations (3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3,
4/4, 5/1, 5/2, and 5/3) between September 20, 2019 and November 11, 2019. (Figure 1-1 through Figure
1-3. Generally, drilled pier foundation structure locations were excavated using metal sleeve casings and
slurry to prevent wall collapse, making visual monitoring difficult. Mechanical auguring generally
revealed two zones within the stratigraphic profile. Zone 1 consisted of black (10YR 2/1) clay with
approximately 10 percent root inclusions, to a maximum depth of 10 feet (3 m) below the surface. Zone 2
extended from the termination of zone 1 and typically consisted yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay with
weathered calcium carbonate (CaCO3) extending to a maximum observation depth of 22 feet (6.7 m)
below the surface (Figure 3-1 through 3-17; Table 3-1). Calcium carbonate observed within zone 2
represents Stage II carbonate accumulation which occurs over the course of thousands of years (Abbott
2011) and is generally considered an indicator of pre-Holocene soils. No archeological material was
observed during construction monitoring of the Project.
