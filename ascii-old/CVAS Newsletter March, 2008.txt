Steven Schooler to Present
March Program

Butterfield Station at
Ft. Chadbourne to be Excavated

Steven will give a program on his
Master’s Thesis research which involves
lead isotope analysis of musket balls and
other lead artifacts from seventeenth and
eighteenth-century sites in Texas and Oklahoma. Using his techniques, Steven has differentiated French and Spanish sources of
lead at nine different colonial-era sites. By
testing over 100 artifacts from these sites,
Steven has been able to draw a number of
conclusions about trade patterns between
the Spanish, French and various Native
groups during the 1700s.
Steven is currently studying archaeology in the Anthropology Masters program
at Texas State University-San Marcos. Steven earned his bachelor’s degree in Anthropology from Texas Tech University in Lubbock in 1998, and, before entering graduate
school in 2004, worked for several years on
a wide variety of archaeological projects
throughout Texas and the Southwest, including Grand Staircase-Esclante National
Monument in southern Utah.

CVAS’s next project is scheduled for
the week of March 31- April 4 and April 7April 11. The CVAS and SMARTS will
conduct an excavation of the Butterfield
Stage Station at Fort Chadbourne. The Iraan
and Midland Archeological Society have
also been invited to participate.

A work day will be set up Saturday,
April 5 if sufficient people are interested.
This will prove to be a very rewarding and
productive excavation, as almost all
Butterfield Stations are on private lands,
and few, if any, of the stations have been
formally excavated by archeologists.

to schedule.

SWFAS Annual Meeting

Ron Ralph to Present April Program
Ron Ralph, retired archeologist from
the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife,
and former President of the Texas Archeological Society, will present April’s program on
Ft. Jefferson, a mid 1800s fort located 70
miles off of Key West, FL. Originally built
with 16 million bricks to protect the Gulf
of Mexico shipping lanes, the fort is more
famous for its use during the Civil War as a
dumping ground for criminals from Union
armies. It has been called America’s Devil’s
Island.

The annual meeting of the Southwest
Federation of Archeological Societies will be
in Midland on April 5th.
Doug Boyd, the guest speaker, will
present a program on Toyah Focus, the
theme for the meeting. A collection of Toyah
artifacts will be on display.
The meeting will be held at the Sibley
Nature Center, 1307 East Wadley, in Midland. The motel designated for the meeting is
the Plaza Inn, 4108 North Big Spring Street.
Ph 432-686-8733 for reservations.
Registration fee is $10.00. Contact

Saturday afternoon took the attendees
to the Red Rock Ranch. Here is one of the
most scenic & geological interesting areas
of Texas. This is one of the few sites in
North America where one can view naturally exposed Precambrian Sandstone dating
back from 542 million to 4.5 billion years.
One had to keep reminding themselves they
were not in Southern Utah.

CVAS Well Represented at Rock Art
Academy at Van Horn
CVAS members Brownell Roberts, Arnetta Cooper, Marcia Asel, and Ginger and
Claude Hudspeth represented CVAS at the
TAS Rock Art Academy in Van Horn over
the weekend of February 29-March 2nd.
After class room lectures by Melissa
Williams and Reeda Peel of Sul Ross University’s Center for Big Bend Studies, tours
of two well know rock art sites were made.
The first one was to a Lobo Valley petroglyph site located on private lands
(41CU09), 12 miles south of Van Horn. Here
petroglyphs have been pecked and abraded
into large boulders (above) which have fallen
from a rim rock of a small mesa of the Van
Horn Mountains.

Perhaps the most famous petroglyph
here is of the deer that has been pecked into
the ceiling of an overhang. Other petroglyphs are scattered over some 20 boulders
that stretch over three quarters of a mile at
the base of the Eagle Mountains. The ranch
has been used in several movies, including
Larry McMurtry’s “Dead Man’s Walk.”

Rattlesnake Shelter Pictograph Tour

Sign Up
Sign up sheets for tours will be in the interpretive center/office at Seminole Canyon
State Park. Meet Texas Tech representative at the Seminole Canyon Center at 8 AM for a morning tour, or 1 PM for an afternoon tour. Sign 2 liability release forms and make $25 donation
($5 for students) (cash or check payable to Texas Tech University).
Travel
Participants are responsible for their own transportation. Carpooling is encouraged
to reduce the number of vehicles involved as much as possible. Tours will depart at 8:30 AM
and 1:30 PM from the Seminole Canyon Center parking lot. If you are not with the guided
group, you will not be able to get in.
Drive to Langtry on Hwy. 90 (ca. 20 miles). From Langtry, there is a short drive west on
Hwy. 90. We will then enter a private ranch through a locked gate and travel about 3.5 miles on
a rough gravel road. Ranch road is slow and dusty, but 4-wheel is not required. However, your
vehicle needs to have high clearance. The group should be back at Seminole Canyon in about
3 hours.
Difficulty The hike to Rattlesnake Shelter is moderately strenuous. The round-trip walking distance is about 1 mile involving going into and coming out of the canyon on unimproved
trails. We will be in a remote location where response to serious injuries and medical emergencies will be difficult.
Clothing Sturdy hiking boots, long pants, and a hat are recommended.
Restrooms The closest public restrooms are at the Judge Roy Bean Center in Langtry.
Bring
A quart or two of drinking water, camera, walking stick, bug repellent, etc.
Don't Bring Firearms. Pets. Alcohol.

Friends and colleagues: Undersea exploration of shipwreck sites is rapidly growing
in frequency, popularity and sophistication
with improvements in technology and methodology. The potential value of this kind of research is illustrated by Anthropology Field
Notes 6: Shipwrecks - with Odyssey Marine
Exploration, the latest video feature on our
nonprofit streaming-media Web site, The Archaeology
Channel
(http://
www.archaeologychannel.org).
In this series of news-maker interviews,
host Faith Haney of Central Washington University (CWU) explores cultural anthropology
and archaeology. In this sixth episode, taped
in February 2008, Faith visits with shipwreck
exploration company Odyssey Marine Exploration, taking a tour of their conservation lab
and shipwreck exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, Florida. She examines three shipwreck sites, the SS Republic,
the China Blue, and the Dry Tortugas, learning
about the history and conservation of dozens
of artifacts.
This and other programs are available
on TAC for your use and enjoyment. We urge
you to support this public service by participating in our Membership (http://

and

as we reach out to the world community.

Eisenwine Ranch Survey
Huge Success
After a night of being entertained
by coyotes, javelinas, mule deer, and
scuba divers at Balmorhea State Park, 35
members explored the Eisenwine Ranch.
The original ranch house was torn down
due to a large rattlesnake den and appears
to have been built on top of a line of numerous rock middens and several hearths
that extends for several miles. The largest
midden measured 25 meters across. Mussel shell middens were discovered in
nearby Toyah Creek and scattered shells
were observed among the rock middens.
While no evidence was seen of natural
occurring chert, many different colors and
types of flakes were observed. Several
complete projectile points were found and
also two types of manos. In the general
area of the mano finds, a concentration of
three different colors of pottery was
found. Several historic trash dumps were
found, including the base of a kerosene
lantern and possible wagon parts. GPS
readings were taken at 17 locations. Of
special interest was three unknown pioneer graves, a gravel pit with fragments
pieces of a low-grade turquoise, and two
fake graves. Further exploration halted
with the arrival of a dust storm.
