ABSTRACT
On behalf of Lockwood, Andrews, and Newnam, Inc. (LAN), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Redbud Pump Station 794
PP Transmission Water Line (WA 1624) Right-of-Way (ROW) in Collin County, Texas. The
proposed water pipeline will be 54 inches in diameter and approximately 1.11 miles (1.79
kilometers) in length. The water pipeline will be constructed within a ROW varying between 40
feet (12.2 meters) and 90 feet (27.4 meters), with a permanent ROW of 40 feet (12.2 meters). The
cultural resources survey was conducted within a ROW 150 feet (45.7 meters) in width.
The investigation included an archaeological background literature and records review and an
intensive pedestrian survey augmented by shovel tests. As the undertaking will be funded by the
City of McKinney, Texas, cultural resources investigations were conducted to satisfy the
requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 8002.
The background literature review revealed that two previously recorded archaeological sites,
41COL181 and 41COL278, are located within one mile of the proposed project area. Additionally,
ten cultural resources surveys have taken place within one mile of the proposed project area, one
of which parallels the current survey area. Two historic markers are also present within one mile
of the proposed survey area. No National Register of Historic Places properties are located within
one mile of the proposed project area. No Texas Historic Landmarks are located within one mile
of the proposed project area. More information on these resources is presented in the main body
of the report. Neither the previously recorded archaeological nor the historic markers will be
impacted by the proposed project.
Investigations of the project area involved surface and subsurface investigations of two transects
along the proposed centerline with shovel tests excavated at 100-m intervals in areas where ground
surface visibility was less than 30 percent. The majority of the proposed project area was located
in agricultural fields with ground surface visibility ranging from 70 to 100 percent. As such, only
a small segment of the easternmost portion of the survey area required shovel testing.
During SWCA’s investigation a single isolated find was located. This isolated find consisted of a
single, plain whiteware sherd located on the surface in a plowed agricultural field with ground
surface visibility of 100 percent. Excavation of a shovel test and extensive examination of the
surrounding area failed to field any additional cultural material. Because of the lack of additional
cultural material, despite a subsurface test and extensive surface examination, this isolated find
was not considered an archaeological site and was not recorded as such. The whiteware sherd was
photographed but not collected.
Based on the results of the investigation, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed project would
result in NO EFFECT on historic properties. SWCA recommends that the proposed project be
allowed to proceed with no further cultural resources investigations. No artifacts were collected,
thus nothing will be curated except project paperwork and photographs, as per the requirements of
the Texas Antiquities Permit 8002.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Project Title. Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Redbud Pump Station PP
Transmission Water Line (WA 1624) Right-of-Way in Collin County, Texas
SWCA Project Number. 40247
Project Description. Lockwood, Andrews, and Newnam, Inc. (LAN) propose to construct a water
pipeline along Redbud Boulevard and in an agricultural field in central Collin County, Texas. The proposed
5,300-foot water pipeline will consist of new 54-inch-diameter pipeline and will connect the proposed
Redbud Pump Station with the existing water distribution system. This report summarizes investigations
conducted along a 1.11-mile-long (1.79 kilometer) corridor within a 150-foot-wide (45.7 meter) survey area
consisting of the final project alignment. SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted a
background literature and records review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing to
systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the significance of any cultural
resources located within this portion of the project area.
Location. The proposed project area begins at the proposed Redbud Pump Station 794 and extends
northeast along Redbud Boulevard before turning east and crossing agricultural fields and fallow land and
ending at North McDonald Street.
Number of Acres Surveyed. Approximately 20.8 acres (8.4 hectares)
Principal Investigator. J. Eric Gilliland
Purpose of Work. On behalf of LAN, SWCA completed cultural resources investigations to satisfy the
requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 8002.
Number of Sites. No archaeological sites were identified during the cultural resources survey. One
isolated find, a single plain whiteware sherd, was identified. Subsequent investigations failed to reveal any
associated material, and the isolated find was not recorded as an archaeological site.
Eligibility. No archaeological or architectural properties were discovered during the course of this cultural
resources survey. The single isolated find does not constitute an archaeological site, and is considered
ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Curation. No artifacts were collected, thus nothing will be curated except project paperwork and
photographs, as per the requirements of the Texas Antiquities Permit 8002.
Comments. Based on the results of the investigation, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed project
would result in NO EFFECT on historic properties. SWCA recommends no further investigations of the
investigated project area and that the project be allowed to proceed.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Lockwood, Andrews, and Newnam, Inc. (LAN), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Redbud Pump Station PP Transmission Water
Line (WA 1624) Right-of-Way (ROW) in Collin County, Texas. The proposed 1.11-mile (1.79 kilometer)
water pipeline will consist new 54-inch-diameter pipeline. The investigation included an archaeological
background literature and records review and an intensive pedestrian survey augmented by shovel tests
along the proposed centerline. As the undertaking will be funded by the City of McKinney, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, cultural resources investigations were conducted to satisfy the
requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 8002.
The investigations began with a background literature and records review of previously conducted cultural
resources surveys and recorded archaeological sites. The fieldwork consisted of an intensive pedestrian
survey augmented by shovel testing. The goal of the work was to locate all prehistoric and historic cultural
resources in the investigated project area, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries, as appropriate,
for any archaeological sites discovered, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any properties for
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
All investigations were conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the NHPA and the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) minimum archaeological survey standards. J. Eric Gilliland served as
Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist. Fieldwork was completed on April 25, 2017, by Eric
Gilliland and Miles Martin.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Within Collin County, LAN proposes to build a 1.11-mile-long water pipeline that will consist of new 54inch-diameter pipeline. The proposed project area begins at the proposed Redbud Pump Station and runs
northeast along Redbud Boulevard before turning east and travelling across agricultural fields to North
McDonald Street (Figure 1). The water pipeline will be constructed within a ROW varying between 40 feet
(12.2 meters) and 90 feet (27.4 meters), with a permanent ROW of 40 feet (12.2 meters). The cultural
resources survey was conducted within a ROW 150 feet (45.7 meters) in width. Impacts will consist of
clearing of vegetation, excavation of a trench, and installation of the pipe. The project alignment is depicted
on the McKinney West, Texas, and McKinney East, Texas, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangles.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is situated within the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion (U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency [EPA] Level IV Ecoregion) within the Texas Blackland Prairie ecoregion (Level III). The Texas
Blackland Prairie is characterized as smooth to slightly undulating plains distinguished from neighboring
regions by its fine clay soils and natural prairie vegetation. The high occurrence of vertisols, unlike typical
prairie environments found to the north, is a result of the underlying Cretaceous age chalk, marl, and shale
(Griffin et al. 2017). The Northern Blackland Prairie sub region of the Texas Blackland Prairie covers a
belt of Upper Cretaceous chalk, marl, and shales from Sherman, Texas, to San Antonio, Texas. Historically,
the region was shaped by prairie fires and bison grazing resulting in the large expanses of tall prairie grass
(Griffin et al. 2017). The calcareous rich soils produce rich cropland dominated by sorghum, wheat, cotton,
and corn. As a result of the rich soil and agricultural practices, most of the native Blackland Prairie
communities are gone (Griffin et al. 2017).

Geology
Due to the projects location within the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion, the geology of the area is
dominated by underlying chalk, marl, and shale. Two prominent formations produce the rich clay prairie
environment encountered within the project area, the Cretaceous age Austin Chalk and Ozan Formations.
The Austin Chalk formation consists of light-gray, massive chalk with scarce marine megafossils. The
middle portion of the Austin Chalk formation is characterized by thin-bedded marl with interbeds of chalk.
The Austin Chalk formation as a whole is approximately 600 feet thick (Barnes 1991). The Ozan Formation
is characterized by weak, calcareous, poorly bedded, clay. Silt, siltstone beds, and marine megafossils are
found in variable amounts throughout the formation. The Ozan Formation is approximately 425 feet thick
(Barnes 1991).

Soils
Soil survey data obtained from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS 2017) for Collin County
were used to compile a list of soils intersected by the project route. The majority of the proposed project
area is located on Houston black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, and Houston black clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes.
A small portion at the extreme eastern end of the proposed project area is located in Lewisville silty clay,
3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded. Information on these soils is presented below.
The project area is dominated by Houston black clay, which is characterized as deep, well drained, clay
residuum deriving from Cretaceous Age calcareous mudstone (NRCS 2017). It is typically found on level
plains and the side slope of upland ridges and plains. Soils range in color from very dark gray to brownish
gray and reach depths up to and below 203 cm below surface (cmbs).
A very small portion of eastern end of the survey area is located on Lewisville silty clay, 3 to 5 percent
slopes, eroded. This soil is characterized as a deep, well drained calcareous clayey alluvium derived from
mudstone parent material (NRCS 2017). This soil is found on stream terraces and ranges in color from light
brownish gray to olive brown, and reached depths of up to 240 cmbs (NRHS 2017).

CULTURAL CONTEXT
Within Texas, archaeological regions largely reflect topographical settings. This division is seen in Turner
and Hester’s (1999) model of the archaeological regions of Texas, in which Texas is divided into nine
archeological regions, all based on geographical change. Although the divisions of Turner and Hester’s
(1999) are generally accepted, Perttula (2004) further divides these regions, based on physiographic zones
and biotic communities, into 16 distinct archaeological regions. The project area is located in the northcentral Texas archaeological region, and within the Trinity River Basin (Perttula 2004; Turner and Hester
1999). The chronological framework of the north-central Texas region remains unrefined and lacking in
data. For the purpose of this report, chronological information presented is in accordance with the data
available (Ferring and Yates 1997, 1998).
The cultural history of the north Texas region is generally divided into four periods that include the
Paleoindian (11,500–8500 B.P.), the Archaic (8500–1200 B.P.), the Late Prehistoric (1200–250 B.P.), and
the Historic (250 B.P. – present). The historic period usually begins with the arrival of the Spanish at the
beginning of the seventeenth century. However, the northern area of Texas was explored rarely by the
Spanish and was generally solely inhabited by native groups until the 1830s. Thus, the period from 250 B.P.
to 150 B.P. is considered the Protohistoric period for the north-central Texas area (Hunt et al. 1989).

Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian Period was commonly characterized throughout Texas by nomadic big-game hunters who
heavily relied on megafauna of the Pleistocene (e.g., mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse) for
subsistence (sensu Willey 1966). However, a more accurate description of this stage is presented by
Bousman et al. (1990:22) “this period may have seen use by small, mobile bands of nonspecialized hunters
and gathers occasionally utilizing megafauna perhaps only as the opportunity arose.” Thus, according to
Bousman et al. (1990), Paleoindians used a wider variety of resources than previously thought. Evidence
of this broader resource subsistence is based on the works of Johnson (1977), Collins (1998:1505–1506),
and Collins and Brown (2000). Johnson (1977) reviewed reports on numerous Paleoindian sites that
indicated a range of small and medium fauna were harvested in addition to big game. Investigations at the
Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235), the Gault site (41BL323), and Lubbock Lake (41LU1) provide evidence
of small and medium faunal remains (i.e., turtle, rabbit, squirrel, snakes, gopher, and deer) associated with
megafaunal remains (i.e., bison and mammoth) (Collins 1998: 1505–1506). Clovis and Folsom points are
the primary diagnostic artifacts associated with this period (Turner and Hester 1999; Collins 1995).
The Paleoindian period of occupation in north-central Texas is known through the presence of diagnostic
lithic projectile points in surface collections or from limited excavations. Due to the paucity of large intact
Paleoindian sites and the fact that most artifacts are manufactured from non-local materials, researchers
characterize these Paleoindian groups as highly mobile. Very few sites in this area exhibit definitive
contextual integrity; however, some Plainview material associated with a radiocarbon date of 9,260 B.P.
was found at the Horn Shelter (Hunt et al. 1989; Peter et al. 1990). In addition, the Lewisville and Aubrey
sites in north-central Texas showed discrete Paleoindian components with the recovery of Clovis points
(Owens 2007). The Lewisville site contained 27 hearth features in association with a Clovis point and other
sparse lithics in a near-surface context (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958). The Aubrey Site contained a Clovis
component in association with cultural features and concentrations of lithics and animal bones near the Elm
Fork floodplain in Denton County (Ferring 2001).

Archaic Period
The Archaic period is further subdivided into Early (8,500–6,000 B.P.), Middle (6,000–3,500 B.P.), and Late
(3,500–1,200 B.P.) (Perttula 2004:9). The Archaic stage signifies a shift away from big-game hunting
subsistence strategies to a less mobile, more generalized subsistence strategy. This change in subsistence
strategies encompasses a greater exploitation of local environments with the utilization of plants and
animals located in the immediate vicinity. Generally, trends during the Archaic period suggest increasingly
complex settlement systems which correspond with decreased mobility, increased population size and
density, and the development of distinct territories (Prikryl 1990; Story 1985). Along with the change in
subsistence practices a change is also seen in lithic technology. Evidence of this is apparent in the
archaeological record where lanceolate-shaped points gave way to dart points that ware stemmed and
barbed and in the production of groundstone artifacts (Black 1989; Collins 2004).
The primary cultural marker of this time period in Texas is the burned rock midden (Collins 2004:119).
These piles of burned limestone, sandstone, and other lithic debris represent the remains of multiple ovens
that were used, reused, and discarded over time. Although Archaic peoples were still nomadic in nature,
subsistence activities became more seasonal, involving the utilization of food resources specific to certain
localities and seasons. During the Archaic period, the climate changed from wet and mild conditions seen
in the Paleoindian period, to warmer and drier conditions. Researchers believe that the changes in climate
influenced prehistoric subsistence strategies (Story 1985:38–39; Weir 1976).

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period is marked by the replacement of the atlatl with the bow and arrow as indicated
by the production of small arrow points (Hester 1981:122). With this technological advancement an
apparent increase in warfare is reported (Black 1989; Story 1985). However, the presence of dart points in
contexts from Cooper Lake sites dating to the Late Prehistoric indicate that the atlatl was still in use even
after the introduction of the bow and arrow (Fields 2004:361). During this stage other new technological
adaptations came about. Ceramics and agriculture became important in the lifeways of the Late Prehistoric
peoples. The first evidence of horticulture appeared and resulted in significant changes to ecological and
economic adaptations.
In north-central Texas, the Late Prehistoric dates from A.D. 700 to 1700, and is further subdivided into the
Late Prehistoric I (A.D. 700–1200) and Late Prehistoric II (A.D. 1200–1700).

Late Prehistoric I
The Late Prehistoric period is characterized by Scallorn, Catahoula, Steiner, Alba, and Bonham arrow
points, as well as sand- and grog-tempered ceramics appearing around A.D. 1000 (Prikryl 1990). There is
some evidence of influences from other regions in that some locally manufactured wares display designs
similar to those associated with east Texas Caddo ceramic types. Evidence for corn agriculture and the
building of structures has been found at sites at Mountain Creek Lake in Dallas County and at Hubert Moss
Lake near the Red River (Lorrain 1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988). Farther west, cultural
changes also were taking place, though the inhabitants of this area continued to practice an Archaic lifestyle
even after technological innovations such as the bow and arrow were accepted (Lynott 1981:106).

Late Prehistoric II
During the Late Prehistoric II in north-central Texas, influences from the Southern Plains became
pronounced and coincided with an apparent increase in bison herd size (Lynott 1981:106; Prikryl 1990:80).
Bison was important to subsistence, but presumably shrinking procurement territory sizes due to population

increases continued the trend toward horticulture and settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris
and Morris 1970). In terms of technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage was common (Prikryl 1990:80).
Items associated with this assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some of which fit the
description for the type Nocona Plain (shell tempered), and unstemmed triangular arrow points such as
Maud, Fresno, Harrell, and Washita, as well as Perdiz points. Interpreted tools specific to bison processing
include snub-nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edge-beveled Harahey knives. Bison scapula hoes, which are
common in Plains Indian sites, have been recovered from sites in the Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas
of Denton and Collin Counties (Barber 1969:118–119; Harris 1945).

Historic Context
The Historic period in Texas can be divided into two sub-periods: the Protohistoric and Historic. The
Protohistoric Period of north-central Texas is not well documented archaeologically, but a few pieces of
information from Spanish explorers have made their way into the record. At the time, Native American
groups inhabiting the area consisted predominately Caddo Indians (Minor 2017) or possibly Wichita groups
that had moved into the area in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Fields 2004:349). Due to
remoteness and aggressive attacks by local Native American tribes, little European-American settlement of
the area occurred until shortly before the Civil War. As settlers began moving into Collin County outbreaks
of violence occurred, ultimately pushing out the Caddo by the mid-1850s (Minor 2017). The lack of Native
American conflict, fertile soil, and promise of free land via land grants by the Peters colony slowly drew
settlers to the area.
Collin County was settled to two phases; early farmers from 1840 to 1860, and after 1870 with the arrival
of railroads (Minor 2016). Due to the lack of transportation to connect to the larger markets, early farms
remained small, relying on wheat and corn rather than cotton. With the introduction of the Houston and
Texas Central Railway in 1872, which connected McKinney to Houston, Texas, and also to markets to the
east, settlers were able to take advantage of the fertile Blackland Prairie soils and a 50-year period of growth
for the region began (Minor 2017). While agriculture remains an important part of the economy, the growth
of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area has resulted in a diverse and fruitful economy for the area.

METHODS
Background Review
SWCA conducted a background review to determine if the project area has been previously surveyed for
cultural resources or if any archaeological sites have been recorded within a 1-mile radius of the project
area. To conduct this review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the McKinney West, Texas, and McKinney
East, Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA) (THC 2017). These sources provided information on the nature and location of previously
conducted archaeological surveys, previously recorded cultural resources, locations of NRHP-listed
properties, sites designated as State Antiquities Landmarks, Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs),
Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys.

Archaeological Survey
Investigations of the project area involved surface and subsurface investigations of two transects
along the proposed project centerline with shovel tests excavated at 100-m intervals in areas with
ground surface visibility of less than 30 percent in accordance with THC standards.

Right-of-Way in Collin County, Texas

Shovel tests measured roughly 30 x 30 cm in size and were excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to
a depth of 1 m or to culturally sterile deposits, whichever came first. All excavated soil was
screened through ¼-inch (6-mm) mesh hardware cloth to retrieve any cultural materials that might
be present. The location of each shovel test was recorded using a Trimble GEO XT handheld
global positioning system (GPS) receiver. Data for each shovel test were recorded in field books.
Soils were described utilizing standard terminology and colors were identified with a Munsell Soil
Color Chart. Areas with previously recorded or newly discovered cultural resources would have
required additional shovel testing, per THC standards, to explore the nature and extent of the
cultural deposits. Photographs were also taken at each location and were recorded on appropriate
field forms.

RESULTS
Background Review Results
The background literature review revealed that 10 previous surveys have been conducted within one mile
of the proposed project area. One of these projects (Atlas Number 8500000843) paralleled a portion of the
current proposed project area, and another (Atlas Number 8500080008) is located across Redbud Boulevard
from the proposed project area. Table 1 summarizes the previous surveys that are within one mile of the
proposed project area. Two previously recorded archaeological sites and two historic markers are located
within one mile of the proposed project area.
Archaeological survey Atlas Number 8500000843 was a linear survey conducted for the City of Irving,
Texas, in 1999. This survey area parallels the current proposed project area. No additional information is
available regarding this survey.
Archaeological survey Atlas Number 8500080008 was conducted for the City of McKinney in 2016 by AR
Consultants for the proposed Redbud Pump Station. This project area is located across Redbud Boulevard
from the current proposed project area at the location of the Redbud Pump Station. This survey resulted in
the discovery and registration of archaeological site 41COL278, discussed below.
Neither of the two archaeological sites within one mile of the proposed project area is located within or
adjacent to the proposed project area. The first of these sites, 41COL181, is located approximately 0.65
mile south of the proposed project area. Site 41COL181 consists of the structure and associated
archaeological deposits of the former Wilmeth-McKinney home. The original home, which had been built
in 1846, was torn down in the 1940s and replaced by a smaller structure. Archaeological deposits are
associated with this property. The NRHP eligibility of this site is undetermined. Archaeological site
41COL181 will not be impacted by the proposed project.
Archaeological site 41COL278 is located approximately 185 m northwest of the proposed project area. This
archaeological sites consists of the destroyed remains of a farmstead. The site was recommended as not
eligible by the investigator. Archaeological site 41COL278 will not be impacted by the proposed project.
Two historical markers are located within one mile of the proposed project area. The first, Marker Number
6178, is the marker titled “McKinney” and is located approximately 1,420 m south of the proposed project
area. The other marker, number 6219, is titled “Wilmeth-McKinney Homestead” and is located
approximately 1,040 m south of the proposed project area. Neither of these markers will be impacted by
the proposed project.

Archaeological Survey Results
Field survey of the entire 1.11-mile proposed waterline was completed by SWCA archaeologists on April
25, 2017. Investigations of the project area involved surface and subsurface investigations of two transects
spaced approximately 5 m apart along the proposed centerline with shovel tests excavated at 100-m
intervals in areas where ground surface visibility was less than 30 percent, in accordance with THC
standards. Five shovel tests were excavated within the proposed project area (Figure 2).
The southern portion of the proposed project area along Redbud Boulevard was located within a recently
plowed but unplanted agricultural field (Figure 3). The ground surface visibility in this area was 100
percent. An isolated find (IF 1) consisting of a single plain whiteware sherd was discovered on the surface
in this portion of the project area (Figure 4). A shovel test immediately adjacent to this find revealed a soil
profile consisting of 10YR 3/1 clay from the surface to a depth of 20 cmbs, underlain by 10YR 3/2 clay.
No cultural materials were recovered from this shovel test, or from extensive examination of the surface
around the location where IF 1 was located.

The northern portion of the proposed project area paralleling Redbud Boulevard was discovered to be
heavily disturbed from ongoing construction (Figure 5). Ground surface visibility was approximately 100
percent in this area as well, and no cultural materials were located.

Figure 5. Construction disturbance, view to north.

The portion of the proposed project area where the ROW turns east was located immediately north of the
construction disturbance. This portion of the project area, from Redbud Boulevard to the treeline, consisted
of a fallow agricultural field with ground surface visibility of approximately 75 percent (Figure 6). No
shovel tests were excavated in this area. Past the first treeline (visible in the background in Figure 6) the
ROW was located in a corn field. The corn was approximately 1-foot high at the time of survey, and the
rows were oriented east to west, affording ground surface visibility of approximately 90 percent (Figure 7).
No shovel tests were excavated in this area.
The easternmost portion of the ROW consisted of fallow pasture and wooded areas. Ground surface
visibility in this area was approximately 10 percent. Four shovel tests were excavated in this area. The
westernmost three of these shovel tests revealed a soil profile of 10YR 2/1 clay to depths of between 11
and 22 cmbs, underlain by 10YR 3/1 clay, in one case mottled with 10YR5/2 clay. The easternmost shovel
test, excavated near North McDonald Road, revealed a soil profile of 10YR 4/1 silty clay to a depth of 14
cmbs, underlain by 10YR6/4 silty clay. No cultural materials were recovered from any of these shovel tests.
Archaeologists traversed the wooded area to look for any structural remains that may have been present
from a house in this location, but none were found.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of LAN, SWCA conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Redbud Pump
Station PP Transmission Water Line (WA 1624) ROW in Collin County, Texas. The investigation included
an archaeological background literature and records review and an intensive pedestrian survey augmented
by shovel testing. As the undertaking will be funded by the City of McKinney, a political subdivision of
the State of Texas, cultural resources investigations were conducted to satisfy the requirements of the
Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 8002.
The background literature review revealed that 10 previous cultural resources surveys had been completed
within one mile of the proposed project area, and that one of these surveys had paralleled a portion of the
proposed right-of-way. Additionally, two previously recorded archaeological sites and two historic markers
are located within one mile of the proposed project area.
Investigations of the project area involved surface and subsurface investigations of two transects paralleling
and on each side of the proposed centerline. Shovel test were excavated in the easternmost portion of the
proposed project area, as this was the only portion of the proposed right-of-way where ground surface
visibility did not exceed 30 percent. Five shovel tests were excavated, none containing cultural material
During SWCA’s investigation one isolated find, a single whiteware sherd, was located on the surface in a
plowed agricultural field. A shovel test and extensive walkover of the immediate area failed to yield any
additional cultural material, therefore the whiteware sherd was considered an isolated find and a site form
was not completed for the find.
Based on the results of the investigation, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed project would result in
NO EFFECT on historic properties within the investigated project area. SWCA recommends no further
investigations of the investigated project area and that the project be allowed to proceed. No artifacts were
collected, thus nothing will be curated except project paperwork and photographs, as per the requirements
of the Texas Antiquities Permit 8002.
