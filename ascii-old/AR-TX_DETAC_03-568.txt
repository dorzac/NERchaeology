ABSTRACT
In August 2015 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resource management survey for the City of Tyler, Texas of two
tracts totaling 39.4 hectares (97.5 acres) east of the Lake Tyler West for timber thinning
operations. Timber will be thinned east of Eastside Road in Tracts 15399 and 15893.
The pedestrian survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #7375 in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. Pre-field investigations found the
topographic maps showed two buildings in the project area. Further analysis revealed the
buildings were between 43 and 49 years old. The visual examination of the building
locations found leveled areas and debris consistent with commercial use. No building
foundations were observed. No artifacts were collected. Visual examination and shovel
testing of the remainder of the project area did not recover any cultural material. No
artifacts were curated. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no
effect” to State Archaeological Landmarks or National Register of Historic Places
eligible properties and SAL as defined by the Antiquities Code of Texas for the proposed
timber thinning.

INTRODUCTION
In August 2015, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey for the City of Tyler, Texas of two tracts along
Eastside Road near the Lake Tyler West (Figure 1). The survey was conducted upon
request of the City of Tyler for timber thinning operations in compliance with the Texas
Antiquities Code. The project was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
under Texas Antiquities Permit #7375. All terms of the permit were carried out pursuant
of the Texas Antiquities Code.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. Initial examination of the topographic maps
suggested there were two historic period buildings. Further topographic map analysis
revealed the buildings were constructed between 1965 and 1972. The pedestrian survey
found the area around both buildings was cut level with Eastside road. No structural
remains were found, but several debris piles of oil cans, plastic, and metal items were
noted. No artifacts were collected from the building locations and no artifacts were
found in shovel tests or during the surface inspection of the project area. No artifacts
were collected during the survey; therefore, no artifacts were curated.
The report was prepared following the short report format outlined by the Council
of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a). Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a
determination of “no effect” to cultural resources eligible to the National Register of
Historic Places or State Archaeological Landmarks for the proposed timber thinning
operations.
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed timber thinning includes removing select trees from the two tracts
totaling 39.4 hectares (ha) (97.5 acres (ac)) with heavy machinery. Tract 15399 is
roughly 25.3 ha. (62.6 ac) while Tract 15893 is roughly 14.1 ha. (34.9 ac). Both tracts
include upland ridges, backslopes, and narrow drainage floors.

Vegetation includes

mixed hard and soft wood trees with moderate to dense understory of various bushes,
shrubs, and vines. Ground cover is leaf litter and deadfall. Soils are Darco (DaC and
DaE) and Lilbert (LtC) series on the ridge summits and backslopes with Tenaha (TeE)

series in the drainage floors (NRCS 2015). All three soil series are described as loamy
fine sand with slopes between 1 and 20 percent. Upland soils are 60 to 117 cm (24 to 46
inches) deep over sandy clay loam while lowland soils are roughly 86 cm (34 inches)
deep over sandy clay loam. No buried soils are included in the description of the lowland
soils.

Property boundaries were marked with private property fence lines and the

Eastside Road right-of-way.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Smith County was part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The large area investigations in the area are
limited to those along Lake Fork Reservoir (e.g., Brusheth et al 1977) to the northwest
and Lake Palestine (e.g., Keith 1971) to the south. Large linear surveys were conducted
for new roads (e.g., Campbell et al. 2008). The smaller surveys were typically for road
improvements (e.g., Nelson and Perttula 2012). These investigations found, tested, and
conducted data recovery efforts on a variety of historic and prehistoric sites. Most of the
surveys mentioned above focused on low lands and areas adjacent to perennial streams
and well developed floodplains. The numerous small surveys in the area include both
upland and lowland settings. The investigations that documented archaeological sites
found that prehistoric and early historic sites were found adjacent to stream channels in
the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region.
Initially, D.A. Story and others (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) describe the prehistoric
cultures of the Gulf Coastal Plain from southwest Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. The
Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). This document includes several historic contexts, each of which deals with a
particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407)
describes the Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area
between the Red River in the north, the Trinity River in the west, and Angelina River in the
south.

The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200
B.C. - A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the
historic Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian
period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and
gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic
(7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200
B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing
utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens,
prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle,
and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of
northeast Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture
(A.D. 800-1600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).

Larger

aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial
areas.

Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds (Perttula

2004:379). A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level
as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also
established. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the
current cultural setting of the area and marks the expulsion of native populations and the
progression of the American immigrants as they established farms, towns, and counties.
The earliest American moved into the Neches Saline area in the late 1820’s. Smith County
was officially formed on 11 April 1846 with Tyler as the County Seat. Local farmers grew
cotton, fruit, and vegetables. Cash crops became more prevalent with the arrival of the
International-Great Northern Railroad in Whitehouse in the 1870’s. Surviving the Civil
War, the area remained rural until the East Texas oil boom. Industry, the growth of Tyler,
and the creation of Lake Tyler in the 1960’s all contributed to the growth and maintenance
of the area although, chicken, cattle, and siviculture still dominate the local economy
(Smith 2010).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities
Code following survey standards described by the Texas Historic Commission (2015)
and report guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). The purpose of these investigations
was to locate prehistoric and historic cultural resources within the project area, delineate
the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, and make a preliminary evaluation of each
site's integrity and potential for State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) designation and/or
National Register of Historic Properties (NRHP) eligibility. All fieldwork and reporting
comply with the ethics standards of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2015). The atlas contains a current
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys,
archaeological site location maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records
show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded
sites.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area relying on
shovel testing and visual examination to locate archaeological sites within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30
centimeters (cm) square in 10 cm (4 in) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35
in). Following to the THC guidelines, the pedestrian survey included a surface inspection
focused on areas with exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds) along with a
minimum of 49 shovel tests in the 39.5 ha (97.5 ac) area. Shovel test locations were
recorded with Ashtech GPS units with sub-meter post-processing accuracy. Notes were
made about soil color, texture, and shovel test depth.

RESULTS
The project area includes two tracts totaling 39.5 ha (97.5 ac) north and east of
Eastside Road. Tract 15399 is to the west of Reserve Boulevard and Tract 15893 is to the
east.

Private property fence lines describe the northern and eastern boundaries.

Topographically, the project area is on the shoulder of a wide upland ridge dissected by
two intermittent drainages which drain southwest into Lake Tyler West. Neither drainage
has a developed stream channel or floodplain. Vegetation across both tracts is dominated
by mixed hardwood and pine trees with a moderate to dense understory of various
bushes, shrubs, and vines. Ground cover is leaf litter and deadfall.
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2015) found one professional archaeological survey and six sites recorded by volunteers
within 1.6 kilometers (km) (1 mile (mi)) of the project area (Appendix B).

The

documented archaeological investigation was for timber thinning in Forest Stewardship
Area 1 roughly one mile northwest of the current project area (Galan 2013).

No

archaeological sites were recorded during the survey. The volunteers were working for
the UT Tyler education program.

The Camp Tyler Foundation Outdoor Education

Facility recruited volunteers from the Northeast Texas Archaeology Society to teach
students about the documentation of archaeological sites. These individuals recorded six
sites 41SM460-65 on the property west of Lake Tyler West. All six sites contained lithic
scatters found in shovel tests on prominent landforms overlooking the lake. Only sites
41SM460 and 41SM461 found Archaic dart points. Site 41SM460 also contained Caddo
ceramic sherds and historic period materials. NRHP eligibility was not determined for
any of the sites, but their preservation is consistent with the goals of the Camp’s mission.
Examination of the 1977 Bascom 7.5’ topographic map shows two purple squares
for buildings in Tract 15399 east of Eastside Road. The purple squares are building
locations based on aerial photographs in 1972 but not field checked. Examination of the
1966 Bascom 7.5’ Quad shows Eastside Road but nether building is visible on the
topographic map suggesting the buildings were constructed between the 1965 aerial
photograph for the 1966 map and 1972 aerial photograph for the 1977 map. Using this
information, the buildings are between 43 and 49 years old. Unfortunately, Google earth
aerial photographs of the project area begin in 1995 and do not show any development in

6

the area. Both building sites were visited during the field survey. Surface inspection of
the building areas found the areas were leveled to the same elevation as Eastside Road.
Cut banks were recorded with a GPS. The surface inspection found debris piles in both
areas (Figure 2). Debris included metal oil cans, glass bottles, tires, various plastic
fragments. No household items (whiteware, furniture, etc.) were observed. Shovel tests
focused on the areas outside the cut areas. While some metal and plastic debris was
found, no indications were found of a residence or business more than 50 years old. The
surface inspection of the remainder of the project area found drainage channels were
deeply incised with steep slopes but poorly defined stream channels. The widest drainage
floors were found in the eastern end of the project area. The surface was muddy near the
drainage channel. Slopes rose quickly to narrow ridge tops.
A total of 88 shovel tests were excavated across the project area with an emphasis
on elevated landforms overlooking the drainage channels (Figure 3 and Appendix A).
Steep slopes were not shovel tested but visually examined. Upland shovel test profiles
were homogenous across the project area. Soils were light brown loamy fine sand 50 to
120 cm (20 to 49 inches) deep over red sandy clay. Sandstone bedrock was found in the
base of shovel tests along the two narrow isolated ridges along the eastern edge of the
project area. The drainage in the eastern portion of the project area was a more dramatic
feature, but still lacked a defined stream channel. Soils in the drainage floor were dark
gray sandy loam with standing water along a poorly defined channel. Tests along the toe
slope found light brown colluvium with reddish brown mottles over dark gray deposits.
The knife edge boundary between the two deposits suggest the gray colored soil was the
surface and the overlying material was most likely deposited from upslope. Both the
redox features in the overlying strata and the gray color of the underlying strata are
indicative of frequently wet soils. No artifacts were found in the shovel tests and no
material was collected from the two building locations. No artifacts were curated.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Tyler, Texas will conduct timber thinning on two tracts of land
adjacent to Eastside Road near Lake Tyler West. DETAC performed a cultural resources
survey of the tracts in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code under Texas
Antiquities Permit #7375.

The project was reviewed by the Texas Historical

Commission.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. The 1972 topographic map illustrated two
buildings in the project area, but the 1965 topographic map did not show the buildings
suggesting the buildings were built between 1965 and 1972. By the 1995 areal image
there was no evidence of clearings or buildings. Mechanical leveling was found at both
locations and several debris piles including a wide range of metal and plastic items. All
of the items appeared to be from industrial use. No structural remains were observed.
No artifacts were collected from the building locations and no artifacts were found in
shovel tests or during the surface inspection of the project area. No artifacts were
collected during the survey; therefore, no artifacts were curated. All other shovel tests
across the project area were negative and no other surface features were observed.
Based on the shovel test results, the visual examination, and the topographic map
analysis, neither building site merits further investigation. There is little chance of
encountering any additional undiscovered cultural resources in the project area; however,
in the event that human remains and/or archaeological materials are discovered during
timber thinning, then the project activity will cease in the immediate area and DETAC
shall be notified of the discovery. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of
“no effect” to properties listed or eligible for the NRHP as defined by the National
Historic Preservation Act and State Archaeological Landmarks as defined by the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
