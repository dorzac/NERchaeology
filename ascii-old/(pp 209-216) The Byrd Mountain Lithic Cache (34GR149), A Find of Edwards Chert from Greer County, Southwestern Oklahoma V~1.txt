The Byrd Mountain Lithic Cache (34GR149),
A Find of Edwards Chert From Greer County,
Southwestern Oklahoma
Van Tries Button
ABSTRACT
An isolated cache of 21 Edwards chert lithic specimens, found by construction
workers at the toe of Byrd Mountain in southwestern Oklahoma, has a mix of
attributes that other scholars cautiously suggest are indicators of age. The Byrd
Mountain lithics were cached in a very distinctive place in regard to local
landmarks. I suggest that exchange of the ownership of caches of exotic lithics may
have played a role in prehistoric economies. Seeing cache ownership, not the
lithics themselves, as the medium exchanged may provide a better expl anation than
owners’ forgetfulness for the failure to retrieve such caches.

INTRODUCTION
The 21 lithic specimens reported here were discovered by Lugert-Altus
Irrigation District workers in August 1987 during repair of a major break in the Altus
Canal, part of the B ureau ofReclamation’s W. C. Austin Project ~igure 1). The find
was made with a backhoe while the bottom of the canal was being dug down to a
deposit of natural gravels below, probably an ancient steam channel. The excavation was needed for replacement of the washed out canal embankment with one on
a more solid footing.
THECACHE
The materials were reported to have been recovered at about 1 meter below the
precanal ground surface in a tight cluster, right in the path of a small unnamed
drainage in a reach of the canal that was built by compacting fill over the existing
ground as it skirts the toe of Byrd Mountain. The repair work apparently cut into a
zone that had not been disturbed by the original construction. When the new
embankment was in place, the coffer dam that had held back the water was removed,
and the site of the cache was again submerged, making further examination of its
context impossible. No other archeological artifacts have been seen in the area.
The recovered artifacts were found in a tight cluster, as if they had been placed
in a small hole. They consisted of 21 pieces of blue-gray and mottled tan and gray
Cretaceous chert from the Edwards formation of Central Texas, and, when they
were all taken out, they half filled a five-gallon container. Three are ovate bifaces
(Figure 2). Five of the flakes (Figures 3, 4, 5) are without cortex, and thirteen have

some cortex preserved. An exhaustive attempt at refitting the flakes has not been
made, but there are no obvious refits, although the range of material is visually
homogeneous, and all the material could have come from just a few blocks of chert.
The flakes have not been worked into any recognizable finished tools and show no
uambiguous evidence of use. Some edges have some retouch that looks like
trimming. The general ratio of width to length suggests a flake---not a blade--technology (Table 1).
The bifaces are fully worked by the removal of large multidirectional flakes.
They are not finished points, nor are they bifacial cores; they are preforms.

SETTING

The cache was found at the toe of the northern face of Byrd Mountain, an
isolated prominence that is the southwesternmost peak of the Wichita Mountains,
just south of the junction of the Elm Fork and the North Fork of the Red River. The
cache was among jumbled granite outcrops 10 meters above and 100 meters south
of the flat floodplain of the Elm Fork, either close to or in the bank of an intermittent
drainage that rather neatly halves the north face of the mountain, which rises
precipitously above.
DISCUSSION
Lithic caches of the Southern Plains have been exhaustively addressed by
Tunnell (1978), and Edwards caches, more particularly, by Wykoff (1984). Wykoff
(ibid.:Tables 1 and 2) discusses five Edwards caches in Oklahoma and five in New

Mexico that have been documented. There are probably more undocumented
Edwards caches (written communication, Robert Brooks, Norman, Oklahoma,
September 18, 1987). Edwards caches quite far from the sources from which they
were quarried are a regular, though certainly not a common, occurence.
Some of the attributes suggested (Tunnell 1978, Wykoff 1978) for distinguishing caches are (1) close to or distant from the quarry, (2) made up of bifaces or flakes,
or both, and (3) isolated or associated with camp or village sites. The Byrd Mountain
cache documents further the diversity of westem Oklahoma caches, for like the two
other isolated caches (Brush Creek and Patterson) known in the area, Byrd
Mountain is a mix of flakes and bifaces. But unlike those two sites, the Byrd
Mountain bifaces are ovate-acuminate (i. e., not ellipsoidal, but more triangular in
outline). The site of the Byrd Mountain cache suggests another attribute that may
be useful in evaluating isolated caches. This cache is in a very distinctive location,
and it would be easy to provide directions to it. Ease of relocation is, indeed, an
attribute that cannot be objectively defined, but even so, it is probably an important
one.
A speculative thought, offered to explain isolated caches, is that those who
deposited the caches may not have intended to retrieve them (Wykoff 1984:11,12).
They may have been making offerings like those made in the course of vision quests;
at the risk of being too speculative, the author suggests that some caches that were
buried where they could have been relocated easily may have been left in place on
purpose. Caches of exotic lithic artifacts are plausible components of primitive
exchange systems where the caches function like money; the ownership of the
caches is exchanged, but the caches themselves are never unearthed. Like kula
objects, Yap money, and gold in Fort Knox, the intrinsic value of the object (i. e.,
the worth of what it can do or make) is replaced by the greater value of what it has
in the past been traded for. A cache, to function this way, would need to be hidden
where it could be easily relocated. Once the cache has achieved a value greater than
its intrinsic worth, there would be a strong reason for not recovering it.
