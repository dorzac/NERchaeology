A Cultural Resources Survey of 42
Acres for the New Caney Athletic
Fields, Montgomery County, Texas

Prepared for Sovereign Bank, Dallas, Texas
and
ME Advisors, LC, Dallas, TX
by
David L. Nickels, Principal Investigator
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations Report #364

Abstract
ME Advisors, LC, of Dallas,Texas was the lead agency for developing two adjoining 21-acre
tracts in southeastern Montgomery County. The total 42 acres were to be utilized as athletic
fields, named ‘Vitality Fields’ and ‘Ability Fields’. Although the properties were privately
owned and funding for the project did not include public funding, the loans secured through
Sovereign Bank in Dallas to develop the properties were guaranteed by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. As such, the project was subject to project review under Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966.
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian survey of the surface area in
accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards on July 11 and 12, 2015. The pedestrian survey of the 42
acres was conducted in transects of 30-meter intervals. Three archaeologists meandered back
and forth between transect lines to ensure better coverage. The pedestrian survey was then
followed by the excavation of 25 shovel tests. No evidence of either historic or prehistoric
cultural material was observed either on or below the surface. As such, Tierras Antiguas
recommended that no further investigations are warranted, and that construction of the proposed
athletic fields should be allowed to proceed as planned.
However, if any cultural resources were to be encountered during construction, work should
immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds were examined and evaluated by Tierras
Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas State Historic
Preservation Officer.
No artifacts were collected or curated, and no potentially historic structures were adjacent or
visible from the Project Area.

Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I express my sincere appreciation to Ms. Kathryn Walker, Senior Vice
President for Small Business Lending at Sovereign Bank. Kathryn was extremely helpful and
patient in explaining the scope of this project, and she graciously shared previous knowledge of
the Project Area. In addition, we wish to acknowledge Mr. Bill Hartley, Principal at ME
Advisors, LC in Dallas.
Next, I very much relied upon staff archaeologists Belisario Silva and Emory Worrell,

Introduction
ME Advisors, LC, of
Dallas, Texas is the lead
agency for developing
two adjoining 21-acre
tracts in southeastern
Montgomery County
(Figures 1-4), and
occasionally hereinafter
referred to as the Project
Area (PA).
The total 42 acres are to
be utilized as athletic
fields, named ‘Vitality
Fields’ and ‘Ability
Fields’. Although the
properties are privately
owned and funding for
the project does not
include public funding,

guaranteed by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. As such, the project was subject to project review under Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Sovereign Bank of Dallas contracted with
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, LLC to conduct a cultural resources assessment
of the 42 acres.
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian survey of the surface area on
July 11 and 12, 2015, and 25 shovel tests were excavated. The survey and shovel testing were
conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the
Council of Texas Archeologists.

Project Setting
Geology
The local geology within the Project Area (Figure 5) is comprised of Lissie Formation clays,
silts, sands, and a very few siliceous pebbles and small gravels. Common within the Lissie
Formation are areas of locally calcareous deposits exhibiting calcium carbonates, along with iron
and iron-manganese oxides. These are most common in areas of weathering low fluvatile
deposits such as was observed during our survey of the Project Area. In addition, one could
expect to observe rounded shallow depressions and an occasional pimple mound on the surface
(Barnes 1992).
The Lissie Formation is very ancient, and was laid down during the Early Pleistocene Epoch,
roughly one million years ago, thus preceding the believed occupation by humans in North
America. Notably, no lithic materials that are suitable for either stone tool production or stone
hearth construction are typically found within the Lissie Formation.
According to Abbott (2001:157), the Lissie Formation on an upland landform with a Holocene
veneer such as exists across the 42-acre Project Area suggests the following potential for
archaeological sites to exist:
Paleoindian - Slight surface potential; no deeply buried potential
Early Archaic - Slight surface potential; no deeply buried potential
4

Middle Archaic - Slight surface potential; no deeply buried potential
Late Archaic - Slight surface potential; no deeply buried potential
Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric - Slight surface potential; no deeply buried potential

Figure 5. Geological map of the Project Area.
Soils
The soil type to be impacted within the Project Area (Figure 6) is Splendora fine sandy loam
(Sp), commonly found on nearly level, deep, but poorly drained areas in this portion of
southeastern Montgomery County (McClintock et al. 1972; Websoil Survey Online 2015).
Splendora soils are classified as hydric in nature. That is, they were “...formed under conditions
of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic
conditions” (Hydric Soils 2015).
Developed in loamy deposits, a typical soil pedon of Splendora fine sandy loam consists of the
following:
0-4 inches (0 -10 cm): Dark grayish-brown fine sandy loam; structureless, very friable, medium
acidic; common tree roots
4-10 inches (10- 25 cm): Grayish-brown fine sandy loam; medium acidic, structureless, common
faint light-gray and dark-brown mottles that are hard, very friable, and structureless; common
5

tree roots; few sub-rounded ironstone concretions
10-20 inches (25-51 cm): Mottled yellowish-brown and light brownish-gray loam with a
subangular blocky structure that is hard and friable; common tree roots; strongly cemented
ironstone concretions; very strongly acidic
20- 22 inches (51-56 cm): Light brownish-gray loam; common and distinct yellowish-brown
mottles; weak, subangular block structure; common strongly cemented ironstone concretions;
common tree roots; very strongly acidic
22-46 inches (56 -117 cm): Distinctly mottled light brownish-gray, yellowish-brown, and strongbrown sandy clay loam with a weak blocky structure that is hard and brittle; patchyclay films
are present on ped faces; strongly cemented ironstone concretions are common; very strongly
acidic
46 - 69 inches (117-175 cm): Prominently mottled light brownish-gray, yellowish-brown, and
red sandy clay loam with a weak and subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, and brittle;
patchy clay films on peds; strongly acidic
69 - 95 inches (175-241 cm): Prominently and coarsely mottled light-gray, brownish-yellow, and
yellowish-red sandy clay loam; weak and blocky structure; extremely hard and friable; strongly
acidic

Climate, Flora,
and Fauna
The physiographic
makeup
of
Montgomery
County is a
combination of
three distinct
physiographic
regions of Texas:
the East Texas
Timberlands, the
Texas Blackland
Prairie, and the
Texas Gulf Coastal
Plain (Figure 7).
More specifically,
the Project Area
lies within a
transitional zone
where
the
timberlands give
way to the coastal
plain. The annual
average rainfall is
about 47 inches
(119 centimeters),
with 270 growingseason days per
year (Long 1996).
With its flat to Figure 7. Physiographic regions of Texas (Maps 2015).
gently rolling
terrain, elevation across the county ranges from 79 feet in the southern part to 330 feet in the
northwestern part (McClintock et al. 1972). The climate is classified as subtropical humid, with
an average low temperature of 390F in Winter to an average high temperature of 950F in Summer
(Long 1996).
On the periphery of the Piney Woods, and typical of East Texas, thick stands of longleaf,
shortleaf, and loblolly pines are not uncommon in Montgomery County. In addition, maple,
sweet and black gum, oak, and magnolia trees can be seen in abundance. Grasses within the
county include Virginia wild rye, blackseed needle grass, and purple top. Because of its unique
ecological ecotone, an abundance of mammal wildlife is extant within the environs of
Montgomery County, including eastern gray and fox squirrels, bats, skunks, gophers, mice,
rabbits, armadillos, raccoons, white-tailed deer, opossum, bobcat, coyote, and red and grey
foxes. Reptilian species include alligators, frogs, toads, copperhead snakes, cottonmouth snakes,
7

coral snakes, and rattlesnakes. The county also harbors vestiges for a wide variety of birds such
as mockingbirds, cardinals, doves, quail, bluejays, and roadrunners, just to name few (Long
1996).

Cultural Context and Chronology
The Project Area is located in the Southeast Texas archeological region (Perttula 2004).
Humans have lived in the Southeast Texas area for at least 11,000 years. The currently accepted
framework of prehistoric culture history for the Southeast region is outlined by Ricklis (2004).
This region identifies populations ranging from the Paleoindian period (prior to 8000 B.P.
[Before Present]), to Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 8000-2,000 B.P.), to the Ceramic period
(2000-1300 B.P.), and to the Late Prehistoric period (1300-ca. 500 B..P). These cultural time
periods are based on changes archeologists perceive in the material record related to
environment, technology, subsistence practices, and/or population size of prehistoric cultures.
Paleoindian Period (ca. 11,000-8000 B.P.)
Paleoindian sites are rare and often consist of isolated finds of diagnostic artifacts such as those
that have washed up on McFaddin Beach (41JF50) over the years (Long 1977). Lanceolate
projectile points with ground, concave bases and longitudinal fluting typical of Paleoindian tool
technology recovered in this region suggest that early occupations were principally distributed
along the valleys of major stream basins (Perttula 2004) or along the Gulf Coast (Ricklis 2004).
However, beyond defining point types, archeologists know very little about Paleoindian lifeways
in Southeast Texas because no sites with intact components have ever been systematically
investigated (Ricklis 2004). Applying more complete data from other parts of Texas,
archeologists generally assume that Paleoindians in East Texas practiced a nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle, and that this lifestyle continued well into the Archaic period, despite changes
in climate and environment (Story 1990).
Archaic Period (ca. 8000-2000 B.P.)
Changes in technology accompanied climate and environmental changes during the Archaic
period (8000 - 2000 B.P.). Following the sequence for other parts of Texas, the Archaic Period
is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late divisions. Each of these subdivisions has
characteristic types of artifacts, especially projectile points, which suggest differences in
economy, technology, and possibly regional adaptations. A general outline of dart point
chronology during this period in Southeast Texas is available (Ricklis 2004), and many Archaic
sites represented by flaked stone dart points and other lithic tools have been found in the inland
region of southeast Texas, mostly near major streams. Neches River, Bell/Calf Creek and Trinity
points represent the Early Archaic; Bulverde, Yarborough, Travis and Palmillas represent the
Middle Archaic. However, the paucity of other evidence (i.e. faunal, botanical, etc.) allows for
little generalization regarding subsistence strategies other than the suggestion that these groups
were likely engaged in some form of hunting and gathering. In general, sites with intact Early
and Middle Archaic components are rare in Southeast Texas. On the coast, Archaic period sites
of Southeast Texas consist mostly of shell middens located along the shores of secondary bays,
8

or in and around river mouths and deltas (Ricklis 2004). The most complete Archaic sequence
of occupation in this region was recovered from the Eagle's Ridge site (41CH252) in Chambers
County. In this densely stratified shell midden, a large sample of features and artifacts
(comprising mostly of Rangia cuneata, but also oyster shells) from the earliest part of the period
to the latest were recovered.
The number of known Late Archaic period sites is much higher than any previous period and
this has led researchers to suggest significant population growth occurred during this time. Data
from Late Archaic sites in Southeast Texas also indicate that people were becoming more
sedentary. These data include the use of poor quality local lithic materials, which suggests that
there was reduced mobility and smaller, more localized territories. Cemeteries such as the Ernest
Witte Cemetery (41AU36) at the western edge of the Southeast Texas region, also become more
common. These cemeteries could be quite large and often contained grave goods. For example,
Group 2 of the Ernest Witte cemetery contained 145 individuals along with lithics, bone pins,
shell beads, and shell pendants (Ricklis 2004). Based on investigations at Late Archaic period
sites, archeologists posit that indigenous people retained a hunting-gathering subsistence
economy but also developed more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their
environment (Story 1990).
The Early Ceramic Period (ca. 2000- 1300 B.P.)
The Archaic period generally ends with the introduction of ceramics in prehistoric sites
(2000-1300 B.P.) During the Early Ceramic period, there is not much evidence of major
changes in lifeways. Early Ceramic period artifacts recovered overlying Archaic ones near river
drainages suggest consistent patterns in subsistence and settlement over time. The earliest
ceramics include thick walled, blocky paste ceramics with little to no temper other than natural
sand inclusions. These chunky pottery types ultimately gave way to the thinner-walled sandy
paste ceramics known as Goose Creek Plain (Aten 1983) that dominate prehistoric assemblages
of Southeast Texas until well into the Historic Period. Story (1990) coined the term Mossy
Grove Tradition/Culture to describe groups that occupied areas in Southeast Texas during the
Ceramic period. It is thought that most Mossy Grove groups were hunters and gatherers who
practiced a seasonal-round subsistence pattern with no permanent settlement.
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1300 – 500 B.P.)
The Late Prehistoric is usually defined by the introduction of the bow and arrow. Evidence from
the Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) suggests that the Late Prehistoric in Southeast Texas can be
divided into the Initial Late Prehistoric subperiod, represented by Scallorn arrowpoints, and the
Final Late Prehistoric period. This latter period correlates with the well-documented Toyah
phase common throughout Texas, represented by an abundance of bison bone and a lithic
assemblage geared towards processing the meat and hides of large game (Ricklis 2004). Unlike
the more sedentary Caddo Indians to the north, the Native Americans of Southeast Texas,
practiced a pattern of seasonal migration, fishing along the coast during the Spring and Summer
months and hunting deer, bison and bear inland during the Winter (Newcomb 2002).
Historic Period (ca. 500 B.P. - present)
Spanish and French explorers traveled through East and Southeast Texas beginning in the
9

sixteenth century. They encountered a number of Caddoan and Atakapan groups living along
the coast and in the piney woods to the north. It is from these reports that archeologists and
historians have learned much of what is known about prehistoric lifeways in Southeast Texas.
According to Newcomb (2002), the area was very sparsely occupied. Those who lived in the
area spoke one of the Atakapan languages. Unlike the Caddo region farther inland, this area was
not conducive to agriculture, due to its salt-saturated and marshy environment. The Atakapan
groups who lived in the coastal region of Southeast Texas typically retained a hunting and
gathering lifestyle well into the eighteenth century, moving seasonally from the coast (in
Summer) where they fished and gathered shellfish and oysters, to inland areas (in Winter) where
they hunted deer, bear, alligator, and occasionally bison. They traveled inland primarily by
dugout canoe along the wide, slow-moving creeks and bayous. They traded dried, smoked fish
to inland groups, and from the Caddos to the north received some ceramics in exchange
(Newcomb 2002).
In 1690, the Spanish began establishing a series of missions in East Texas, starting with San
Francisco de los Tejas (Weddle 2008) near Nacogdoches. In 1756, in response to intelligence
that the French were building trading outposts in the region, the Presidio San Augustín de
Ahumada was built near the mouth of the Trinity. Fifty families moved from Mexico to occupy
it (Newcomb 2002). The Mission Nuestra Señora de la Luz located at the former location of a
French trading post, was established in 1765 near the Trinity River delta. The Indians that were
sheltered by this Presidio and Mission were mainly inland Atakapans, such as Bidais and
Deadoses. They were initially friendly to the Spanish, but eventually aligned themselves with
the French, trading with them for arms. As these indigenous groups were increasingly exposed
to Europeans, trade items such as glass beads, metal points, buttons, and gun parts made their
way into the archeological record. Unfortunately, contact with the Europeans also brought new
diseases, which severely reduced the populations of indigenous villages. By the early nineteenth
century there were perhaps only 100 Bidais, while other Atakapan-speaking groups had
effectively ceased to exist or had become so few that they joined Caddo groups to the north for
survival (Newcomb 2002).
Though lightly populated during the historic period, the area was nonetheless well-known to
many East Texas Indians. Settlers of European descent did not begin to permanently inhabit the
region until the 1830s, and even then only sparsely. White settlers who came to the area
migrated primarily from the southern United States. These immigrants established small farms,
and if they had the means, most of them also owned or brought slaves to help work the farms.
Though East Texas was long-recognized as a valuable resource for its thick forests of loblolly
and longleaf pine, the ability to exploit the region's timber was limited without a means of
transporting it to mills and markets (House 1967).

Montgomery County History
As discussed above, the area that is now Montgomery County has been periodically occupied
by humans for a least the past 11,000 years. There are obviously no written records that can tell
us about them. However, the archaeological records define lifeways, and subsistence and
10

settlement patterns through the 1600s. It was in A.D. 1687 when French explorer René Robert
Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle traveled through the area and made journal entries of the land and
people. The first Native American tribes recorded were the Atakapan Indians, hunters and
gatherers who ranged seasonally south and eastward to the Gulf Coast. “In the early eighteenth
century one of these tribes, the Arkokisas (Orcoquisacs) had campsites along Peach creek and
on the banks of the San Jacinto River. The Bidai Indians, another Atakapan tribe, also ranged
across most of the future county...” “Most of these natives peoples eventually succumbed to
European diseases, were killed by other Indian tribes, intermarried, or migrated elsewhere; by
1850 virtually no trace of them remained” (Long 1996:804).
Fearing French encroachment into Texas, the Spanish attempted to establish settlement in east
Texas. In fact, within the political boundary that is now Montgomery County, the Spanish
established three short-lived missions along Spring Creek, but all three were abandoned by 1756.
Empresario Stephen F. Austin contracted with the Spanish government to bring settlers into the
area. In the early 1820s, 42 Austin Colony families then obtained land titles from the Mexican
government and settled in western Montgomery County. In the 1820s, a settler named Andrew
Montgomery established a trading post at the Loma del Toro Trace and the Lower Coushatta
Trace crossraods which eventually grew into the town of Montgomery. In 1837, Montgomery
County was established by the Republic of Texas Congress, with the town of Montgomery as
the county seat. The town of Montgomery was also on a stagecoach line that ran from Houston
to Huntsville. By 1850, the population of Montgomery County was nearly 2,400, and by 1860
it was nearly 5,500.
Although subsistence farming sustained the early settlers, by the 1850s immigrants from the
southern United States brought their slaves with them and large cotton plantations resulted. “By
1860 the county was producing more than 8,000 bales annually, most of which was hauled
overland by horse-drawn wagons and ox carts to Houston and Galveston” (Long 1996:805).
Montgomery County citizens strongly supported the Confederate cause during the Civil War,
with large numbers of volunteers serving in the Fourth Texas Regiment of Hood’s Texas
Brigade, as well as Terry’s Texas rangers of the Eighth Texas Cavalry. The families of
Montgomery County were devastated by the loss of nearly 75 percent of Confederate volunteers
either killed or wounded in the Civil War.
During the Civil War period, those citizens and their families who did not go off to war had to
endure significantly depressing economic conditions and food shortages. Following the end of
the war, whites no longer had the benefit of slave labor, but the freed slaves fared little better
economically, ending up as agricultural laborers for minimum wage, or as 1/3 share croppers
on lands they did not own.
It was the railroads that began the return of a viable economy in Montgomery County in the
1870s and 1880s. The construction of rails through the county spurned the beginnings of a
lumber boom. By 1882 there were 45 steam sawmills operating in the county. In addition,
tobacco became a major cash crop in the 1890s. However, multiple real life scenarios resulted
in the virtual demise of tobacco being raised as a cash crop in the early 1900s. To wit, it entailed
a considerable investment in labor and time involved in sweating (curing) the tobacco. In
11

addition, the new railroads took advantage and increased shipping costs to more than local
growers could afford. Finally, the United States lifted a tariff on imported Cuban tobacco, which
allowed importers to undercut the prices of locally grown tobacco. Thus, the era of profitable
tobacco growers in Montgomery County was short-lived.
Cotton and corn remained cash crops, but by 1910 many more farmers were raising fruits and
vegetables. Nevertheless, roughly 50-percent of those still farming in the county were tenant
farmers. Meanwhile, lumbering the timberlands in the county continued to bolster the economy.
As with most of the rest of the country, the effects of the Great Depression were hard-felt in
Montgomery County. Cotton production was also hard hit by falling prices, soil depletion, and
boll weevil infestation.
Fortunately, oil in great quantities was discovered southeast of Conroe in 1932, and the oil boom
was on. Commensurate with the oil boom, the population of Montgomery County increased to
over 23,000 in 1940. The advent of WWII necessitated a spike in oil production, and the
county’s economy flourished. Although oil production fell off somewhat following the war, oil
has to this day remained an stalwart for the county. Since WWII, truck farmers were very much
an input to the county’s economic diversity, but also lumbering has peaked as an alternating
major industry as forests are cut, replanted, matured, and re-cut (Long 1996). Today, the City
of Houston and its multiple suburbs with modern development are encroaching within
Montgomery County.

Archaeological Atlas Sites
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within Montgomery, the results simply provide the data that is available. In reality,
the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the types
of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. That said, the data that is
available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the surveys represent. The vast majority of
Montgomery County has never been subjected to formal cultural resource surveys, so it is
conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is very poorly understood.
Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least some aspect of what
the area looks like from an archaeological perspective.
As of July 15, 2015 there were 301 archaeological sites recorded within Montgomery County.
Evidence of ancient hearths, along with diagnostic projectile points and pottery indicate that 132
of these sites had been used as open campsites from as early as the Paleoindian period, and
through as late as the Late Prehistoric periods. One-hundred-forty-seven of the 301 sites have
been classified as lithic scatters, where an abundance of chipped stone with more than a few
temporal diagnostics indicate these sites were also being used from the Paleoindian through Late
Prehistoric periods. At three of the sites, the chert, quartzite, and other cobbles/gravels that were
exposed to the surface have been tested and used to manufacture stone tools over several
thousand years. Other prehistoric sites within Montgomery County include a large Bidai village
12

(41MQ1), presumably the last one in the county, and one site with a possible burial mound
(41MQ58).
Historically, a total of 28 components have been recorded. These include 1880s through 1950s
farmsteads, tenant farms, house sites, and trash dumps/scatters. Other sites of interest include
an abandoned cemetery with 16 known graves, a single burial in an above-ground brick crypt,
a stone-lined well, the 1800s Montgomery wooden jail with a metal cell block, and 1900s
railroad berms. Of particular interest is 41MQ38, site of the Kirbee Pottery Kiln from 1840
through 186, before the men went off to the Civil War (see also Malone et al. 1979). Another
site of note is 41MQ51, throught by Historian Herbert Bolton to possibly be the site of the
Springs Santa Rose de Alcázar (Bolton 1915).
No archaeological sites have been documented within one mile, but as shown in Figure 3, there
had been two archaeological surveys conducted within one mile of the proposed New Caney
Athletic Fields (the Project Area). The first was a linear survey conducted in 1989 for the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA 1989). Presumably the survey was conducted for a
proposed roadway, but for whatever reason, the road was not constructed. The second survey
was another linear survey conducted in 1991 for the Texas Department of Highways and Public
Transportation (TDHWPT 1991). Once again, that survey was presumably conducted for a
proposed roadway that was never constructed.

Historic Maps and Aerial Photographs
In Figure 8, the Project Area is laid over an 1957 topographic map of the vicinity (Maps 1957).
At that time, no structures are shown in the area. In Figure 9, the Project Area is shown on a
1958 aerial photograph; once again, no structures were mapped at that time (Maps 1958).
Finally, a 1959 USGS topographic map (Foster 2006) shows no structures within or adjacent to
the Project Area. None of the three show any indication that the 42-acre Project Area was
developed in the 1950s.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework
is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the
Southeast Texas region. The historic framework is structured around the settlement in the region
as documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests and government
representatives, through Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty, and into the Texas
Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic survey
methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
15

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Pre-field Preparation
Before the official survey began, the Principal Investigator reviewed previous archaeological
and historical reports of investigation, both in hard copy and online, that had been conducted in
the area in an effort to better understand the potential and types of cultural resources that could
potentially be encountered during the survey. In addition, soils and geological maps were
reviewed in order to evaluate the potential depths of archaeological deposits, and the types of
both historic and prehistoric features and associated artifacts that may be present.
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archaeological Sites indicated
that the 42-acre tract had not been subjected to a cultural resources survey, nor were there any
documented archaeological sites within it. However, there were known and documented
potentially significant prehistoric archaeological sites in the area, and it lies within an area that
is rich in 1700s thru 1900s history.
Based upon modern aerial photographs, it could be surmised that much of the area proposed for
development had not been disturbed by cultivation, but was likey logged in the historic past.
However, without an on-the-ground physical survey, the potential for intact and possibly
significant archaeological deposits could only be surmised.
The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the tract
was conducted in transects of 30-meter intervals. Three archaeologists meandered back and forth
between transect lines to ensure better coverage. Surface visibility ranged from 10 to 60 percent
across the area. In addition, all animal backdirt piles were examined.
Twenty-five shovel tests were placed in a systematic pattern across the Project Area (Figures
11 and 12). The results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, and are
described in Appendix A. Shovel tests were dug in 20-cm levels, and all sediments were
screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh (Figure 13).
Following our designed research plan, cultural material of a redundant nature, both prehistoric
and historic, observed either on the surface or within shovel tests would not be collected.
Instead, they were to be fully documented via sketches, field photographs, copious notes, and
a GPS location. Following that they would be returned to the surface if surface finds, or to the
top 10 cm of shovel tests. Exceptions were those artifacts which could be considered as
particularly significant to the interpretation of Texas history, such as diagnostics, as well as
prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These
were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal
Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist. If collected, with the permission of the property
16

owner, they were be curated at CAR-UTSA.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences within the project area were to
be documented as archaeological sites. In addition, any potentially historic buildings 45 years
or older that were located adjacent to the Project Area would be documented with photographs
and included in a Draft and Final report of investigations.
Reporting
If an archaeological site was discovered, the appropriate documents would be filed with the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin to update
the Texas Atlas Database. Even if no site was discovered, the area of survey would be recorded
and submitted as Shape Files for Atlas mapping.
Upon completion of the fieldwork, a Draft report of investigations produced in conformance
with the Secretary of Interior’s Guidelines for Archeological and Historic Preservation report
would be produced and submitted to the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and
other pertinent parties for review. Any comments from the SHPO and other parties would then
be addressed, and Final copies of the report would then be produced and distributed to the Texas
Historical Commission, as well as to the sponsor.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
A full pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 60% visibility was conducted, and an
estimated 500+ crawfish chimneys, as well as approximately three dozen mammal burrows and
backdirt piles were examined, followed by the excavation of 25 shovel tests (see Figures 11 and
12). Because of the generally flat terrain, no drainage cutbanks were available for inspection.
Although as shown for example in Figure 14, a mature forest growth predominated the tract, it
was apparent from sawn tree stumps and heavy machinery tracks that the timber had been
selectively harvested in the not too distant past. Otherwise, in addition to perimeter fencing the
only apparent human disturbance to the 42 acres consisted of a deer stand and blind, and an
overgrown two-track that had been built up and had shallow bar ditches along each side. That
two track is shown in Figure 3 as it cuts from the southwest to the northeast across the tract, but
is not shown on a 2013 topographic map (see Figure 12).
The entire area appeared to be susceptible to flooding and saturation during heavy rainfall (see
for example, Figures 14 and 15), and lower areas held standing water despite the lack of rainfall
for at least a week.

Archaeologists observed only one low isolated rise in the terrain that could be interpreted as a
pimple mound. A single shovel test placed in the center of the mound (Figure 16) yielded no
evidence of cultural material. Typically, yellow and grey very fine silty loam was encountered
in the upper 20-30 cm of the shovel tests, underlain with red, grey, and orange mottled loam to
50-60 cm, before more heavily mottled and crusty loam with occasional ironstone concretions
was found between 60-80 cm below the surface. As discussed above, these mottled, hydric soils
encountered are what should be expected in low lying terrain that is subjected to periodic
inundation.

facing south-southeast.
In sum, a total of 25 shovel tests were excavated and the results of shovel testing are at
Appendix A. No evidence of prehistoric or historic cultural material was found either on the
surface, in any of the numerous animal backdirt piles examines, or in any of the shovel tests.

22

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered between 10% and 60% visibility, along
with the examination of numerous animal backdirt piles and 25 shovel tests within the project
area was conducted, but no evidence of either prehistoric or historic occupation was found either
on or beneath the surface.
In sum, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be allowed to proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the
Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated, and no potentially historic structures are adjacent or
visible from the Project Area.
