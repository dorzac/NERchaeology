Abstract
Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC), Kyle, Texas, conducted a cultural resources
reconnaissance survey in preparation for the construction of a proposed power plant to be built south
of Sherman, Texas. The reconnaissance survey was conducted in accordance with the Texas
Antiquities Code and covered about 130 acres of the 210-acre tract inside which the plant will be
built
The findings were negative; no new archeological sites or historic buildings were found. One
mid-twentieth century barn was observed near the tributary of Choctaw Creek, outside the power
plant footprint and will not be affected by new construction. No prehistoric material was observed
and no High Probability Areas (HPAs) were found that warrant additional intensive survey. No
artifacts were collected and no archeological sites were recorded.
Based on reconnaissance survey results, APC concludes that no further survey work is needed and no
significant cultural resources will be impacted by development. APC recommends, therefore, that the new
construction proceed, as planned. Lastly, if any unexpected cultural resources are uncovered during
construction, work should stop and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified by telephone
at (512) 463-6096. Activity should cease at the location until the find is evaluated by an archeologist in
consultation with the THC.

1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

TITAN Engineering (TITAN), Austin, Texas, on behalf of Panda Energy (Panda), LLC, contracted
with Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC), Kyle, Texas, to conduct a cultural resources reconnaissance
survey of a part of the City of Sherman Progress Park in preparation for construction of a natural gas fired
power plant. The survey was conducted in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code and Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act.
The reconnaissance survey area was made up about 130 acres of a ca. 230-acre tract located between
two unnamed tributaries of Choctaw Creek south of Sherman in Grayson County in North Central Texas.
Choctaw Creek is the southern boundary of the proposed development tract, however; it was not inspected,
because no impacts are planned for the portion of the tract along the creek. The results were negative, no
evidence of archeological sites was found. The location where the known house and outbuildings were located
contained a modern barn associated with a mid- to late twentieth century artifact scatter. The findings show
that the proposed locations where development will take place are Low Probability Areas for the presence of
cultural resources.
APC concludes that due to no significant cultural resources will be impacted by the proposed activity.
In addition, no further survey of the plant locale and routes of the proposed electrical, water, and water waster
lines in needed. APC, therefore, recommends that construction of the proposed Panda Sherman Power Plant
and ancillary features in the City of Sherman Progress Park proceed without any additional work. Lastly, if
cultural resources are uncovered during construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. Activity should cease
at the location until the find is evaluated by an archeologist in consultation with the THC.

2.0 PANDA SHERMAN POWER LLC PLANT
INTRODUCTION
Panda proposes to construct a natural gas-fired power plant inside a ca. 230-acre tract in Progress
Park in Sherman, Texas. (Figure 1). A records search determined that no properties listed on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) fall inside or near the
proposed development. Historic quadrangle maps, highway maps, and aerial photographs were reviewed
during the desktop search. Maps and aerial images show one house and two outbuilding locations present in
the tract.
TITAN Engineering, on behalf of Panda Energy, contracted with APC to perform a reconnaissance
survey of the tract. The survey was conducted in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code and the Texas
State Archeological Survey Standards. The purpose of the reconnaissance survey was to determine if an
intensive survey is needed and to visit the known house site to identify any historic standing structures, to
evaluate its research value, and/or to determine its eligibility status. In addition, segments of tributary flood
plains were examined for prehistoric materials.
PROJECT AREA
Plowed fields and wooded tributaries make up the project area which is situated in an industrial park
south of Sherman in North Central Texas. Historic and current land use is agricultural. The tract has been
intensively plowed. A wastewater line has been installed. The terrain is level to low rolling hills and varies in
elevation from 750 feet above mean seal level ( ft amsl) in the north part of the tract, to 650 ft amsl in the south
part of the tract. A railroad tract passes though the southern part of the project area. The tract and survey
area are bounded on the north by Progress Road, on the south by Choctaw Creek, on the east by one of
Choctaw Creek tributaries, and on the west by an arbitrary property line (Figure 2).
Vegetation is predominately wheat fields and hackberry-lined fence lines streams. Visibility in the
Rows of wheat was high and exceed 60 per cent. Along the creek surface visibility varied from 40 to 100
percent. The flood plain and upland fields are mantled in clay soils 4 to 20 feet deep (Sims 2009). Flood plain
soils are Recent and Holocene in age. In the active flood plain along Choctaw Creek, they consist of frequently
flooded Elbon clay and silty soils up to 72 inches deep. Along the first terrace of the creek, Trinity Clays up
to 65 inches deep, occasionally flooded, are present. Flood plain rises on upland stream terraces of the creek
are covered in Lewisville silty clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes and 60 inches deep.
Upland soils are Quarternary and older in age. The 750 ft amsl ridge top where the plant foot print
is located is covered in Normangee Clay Loam, 1 to 4 per cent slopes, typically with 7 inches of clay loam over
7 to 65 inches of clay. Upland ridge slopes between the terraces and the flood plains contain Fairlies and
Houston Black Clays, 1 to 3 percent slopes and about 55 inches thick. Upland stream terraces are covered in
Wilson Silty clay loam, 80 inches deep, and 1 to 3 percent slopes. Cut banks along upland unnamed tributary
exposures show White-Wright-Eddy-Howe Complex silty clay loam soils, 5 to 12 per cent slope and 20 inches
deep, which line the unnamed upland tributaries of Choctaw Creek.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Panda Energy proposes to construct a natural gas-fired power plant inside a ca. 208-acre tract (Figure
3). The plant footprint, entry, detention ponds, and lay down yard are located will be built inside a 78-acre
fenced area at the north end of the tract off Progress Road. The footprint of the plant measures about 14.4
acres. Lay down yards and construction areas will be about 20 acres. In addition to the area where
construction will occur, there are open areas where no development is planned to act as buffers. South of the
plant and north of the rail road track are plowed fields measuring about 52 acres where no activity will occur.
South of the railroad is another planned open parcel about 71.6 acres. Electrical, water, and
wastewater lines will be installed for the facility (Figure 4). The depth of impact will exceed one meter (3.28
feet) where the facility will be built. Underground utilities and a wastewater line will be installed and could
be buried about 1.22 meters deep (4 feet). The fields are level and little cut and fill will be needed for the
construction of roads, parking lots, and foundations. The FEMA-defined flood zone will not be developed along
the tributaries and Choctaw Creek.

3.0 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY

Research Direction
The research purpose of the reconnaissance survey was to collect new data about the cultural history
and prehistory of the region and to identify any evidence of cultural resources present in the tract proposed for
development that warrant further investigation. The goals of the reconnaissance survey are two-fold. The first
is to evaluate a known house site to its ascertain age, condition, and eligibility status. The second is to examine
the flood plain of unnamed tributaries of Choctaw Creek for surficial prehistoric deposits in order to determine
if an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing is warranted.
Methods
APC obtained Antiquities Permit Number 5284 for the reconnaissance survey from the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) before starting work. During desktop study for the
project, APC reviewed records from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas databases. Site files and pertinent
archeological literature were reviewed. Maps and indices were checked and it was determined that no historic
properties listed on the NRHP, SALs, and/or recorded sites are located inside the project area
The reconnaissance survey was conducted by 2 archeologists and consisted of wind shield and
pedestrian survey in plowed fields and along wooded tributary flood plains. The locations where detention
ponds are planned were walked at 30 meter intervals. The open areas where no building will take place were
subjected to wind shield survey augmented by pedestrian inspection and on flood plain rises. Utility routes
inside the tract were visited and proposed creek crossings were inspected.
Approximately 4500 feet of creek banks (100 feet wide) were inspected via windshield and pedestrian
methods. While driving along the edges of the plowed fields paralleling the creeks, arbitrary stops were made
every 500 feet to perform pedestrian inspection of the flood plain, creek banks, and any nearby flood plain
rises. Lastly, the scope included the pedestrian inspection of a house site.
Systematic shovel testing and/or backhoe trenching were not conducted in the flood plain. Surface
visibility at the house site were 40 percent and in the plowed fields planted in wheat in the flood plain, visibility
ranged from 80 to 100 percent. All soils are clayey with limestone gravels and exhibited extreme shrink swell
cranks due to drought. No chert rocks were observed. Low Probability Areas (LPAs) were not examined. No
temporally or stylistically diagnostic artifacts were found or collected for laboratory analysis or curation.
Finally, after visiting the house site, historic maps were reviewed. Holdings at the Texas State Library
and Archives and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory were further reviewed to determine relative
construction dates for the house site. All findings were summarized in this short report of negative findings
following Council of Texas Archeologists guidelines.

4.0 RESULTS

The results of the reconnaissance survey were negative. No new archeological sites were found. One
mid-twentieth house site was observed with a standing barn. A review of historic maps revealed that the house
was not present in 1947 (Figure 5) and was built in 1958 (Figure 6). Household debris observed on the
surface in the field where the house once stood is sparse, mid- to late twentieth century in age, and fragmentary.
Absence of foundation evidence and subsurface features indicates the house may have been removed and/or
demolished. The locale qualifies as a 50 year old house site, but not as an archeological site, and is outside
the APE, and was not recorded.
Inspection of creek crossings inside the tract for the water line was also negative. No prehistoric
artifacts were observed in plowed fields, erosional features, and upland tributary cut banks observed. The
tributaries are seasonal and down cutting the stream terrace and are head waters of Choctaw Creek. The more
reliable water source is Choctaw Creek, outside the APE. Soils are clayey and consist of Quarternary deposits
on upland streams terraces, while Holocene sediments are present in the flood plain and Recent soils line the
frequently flooded creek.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
The Panda Sherman Power LLC plant reconnaissance survey showed that no significant resources
eligible for National Register of Historic Places or State Archeological Landmark listing are present that will
be affected by the proposed action. Results demonstrated that the historic house site is adjacent to the plant foot
pint and will not be affected. It is mid-to late nineteenth century in age, outside the APE, and does not merit
recordation as an archeological site.
Upland stream terraces with Quarternary deposits in plowed fields do not contain evidence of buried
archeological deposits. Locales in the flood plain will not be developed and Late Holocene deposits will not be
affected. Recently deposited deep sediments along the tributaries do not have the potential to contain deeply
buried prehistoric deposits.
The reconnaissance survey findings indicate that the plant locale and utility line routes are Low
Probability Area for cultural resources and that no intensive pedestrian or mechanical survey of the plant locale
or utility lines is needed. High Probability Areas area likely located along Choctaw Creek, however; they were
not inspected, because creek is outside the APE and no impact is planned in the floodplain.

RECOMMENDATIONS
APC recommends that the project proceed without additional intensive archeological survey work or
consultation. Lastly, APC also recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are exposed during
construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and the Texas Historical Commission should be
notified, by telephone at (512) 463-6096. The find should be evaluated by an archeologist in consultation with
the Texas Historical Commission before digging resumes at the location.
