ABSTRACT
Kilgore Economic Development Corporation (KEDC) is proposing to
construct 1.2 miles of roadway in Synergy Park northeast of Kilgore in
Gregg County, Texas. The project area includes finger ridges and level
uplands between two intermittent drainages. Prehistoric sites are known to
exist in similar natural settings in Gregg County. Despite the pedestrian
survey and the excavation of 17 shovel tests, no historic or prehistoric
sites were uncovered. This may be due to the location of the area in a zone
where reliable water sources were scarce. In addition, due to the
continuous agricultural activity that has been taking place in the area since
the middle of the 19th century, potential for historic sites existed. Such
sites, consisting of farmsteads and artifact scatters, were indeed found
nearby but none were found in the present study area. As a result, AR
Consultants, Inc. recommends no further cultural resource investigations
are warranted prior to the development of the Synergy Park Street.

INTRODUCTION
Kilgore Economic Development Corporation (KEDC) is proposing to construct 1.2 miles
of roadway in Synergy Park northeast of Kilgore in Gregg County, Texas (Figure 1). The
study area is approximately 4500 feet southeast of the Highway 259 and I-20 intersection.
The project will receive funding from the Economic Development Agency, so it must
meet National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements. The Texas Historical
Commission, in a letter dated August 5, 2009, recommended a pedestrian survey
supplemented with shovel testing of the 13.35-acres. KEDC contracted with Adams
Engineering to handle the environmental permitting, who in turn contracted with AR
Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey. The
purpose of this investigation was to assess the potential of encountering significant
historic or prehistoric archaeological sites if a decision is made to construct the project.
Previous investigations in the surrounding area have indicated that there is a moderate
potential for finding sites in this type of setting.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural environment and cultural history of the study area. This is followed by a
description of the research design and the methodology used to carry it out. The results of
the investigation follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents
recommendations that arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the
report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Gregg County is located in the forested region of East Texas. The terrain ranges from
gently sloping to hilly. Numerous tributaries drain into the Sabine River, which is the
major waterway through Gregg County and runs through the county from northwest to
southeast. The project area crosses two intermittent tributaries of Rabbit Creek, which
drains northeast into the Sabine River. Temperatures range from averages of 96° in July
to 38° in January. Rainfall averages approximately 47 inches annually (Perry 2009:1)
The project area is located within the Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest vegetative
community, which includes much of East Texas. The Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest in the
Piney Woods of northeast Texas (Diamond, Riskind, and Orzell 1987: Figure 1) is
characterized as an oak-hickory-pine forest. Major timber trees are pine, oak, hickory,
cedar elm, and sweet gum. Other hardwood associations are found in low, wet
bottomlands. Understory vegetation includes greenbriar, sumac, poison ivy, yaupon, wild
grape, crape myrtle, dogwood, and many other species. This is in the Austroriparian
biotic province (Blair 1950: Figure 1).
The underlying geology of the entire area is the Reklaw Formation, which is an Eocene
age formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1975). This formation is composed of clay
with some ironstone ledges and rubble. The Reklaw overlies the Carrizo Sand and the
undivided Wilcox Group. The closest Quaternary deposits are in the floodplain of Rabbit
Creek, which is approximately 775 meters west of the project area. The soils in the
project area belong to the Bowie-Cuthbert-Kirvin soil association, which are fine sandy
loam soils with loamy and clayey subsoils on uplands (Roberts 1983:General Soil Map).
The specific soils crossed by the proposed roadway are Cuthbert fine sandy loam, Kirvin
very fine sandy loam and Lilbert loamy fine sand (Roberts 1983:sheets 42 and 45). The
underlying sandy clay subsoils range from red to yellowish brown in color and are
encountered between 8 and 51 inches below the ground surface (Roberts 1983:16, 20 and
24).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Culture History
Gregg County is situated in the Pineywoods archaeological region of east Texas as
defined by Perttula (2004) and in the Gulf Coastal Plain region as defined by Story
(1990). The prehistoric era is divided into four major periods, Paleoindian (10,000 to
6,000 B.C.), Archaic (6,000 – 200 B.C.), Early Ceramic (200 B.C. – 800 A.D.) and Late
Prehistoric (800 – 1700 A.D.). These periods are further divided based on differences in
technological styles (Table 1).

Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period ranges from 10,000 to 6000 B.C. Distinctive lanceolate points are
the most recognized artifact from this period and these stone tools were typically
manufactured from high-quality non-local lithic materials (Perttula 2004:373).
Paleoindian peoples were thought to have been nomadic big game hunters, yet it is more
likely that they were generalized hunters and gatherers (Bryant and Shafer 1977:19-20).
Early Paleoindian archaeological sites containing Clovis and Folsom points are thinly and
widely spread throughout these vegetative regions of Northeast Texas (Story 1990:Table
44). The majority of these sites consist of isolated finds of single Clovis points and
recovered from the surface or in mixed content. Late Paleoindian archeological sites are
associated with unfluted lanceolates such as Dalton, Scottsbluff and San Patrice points.

San Patrice points have been recovered from sites concentrated near the Sabine River
Basin in east Texas (Story 1990:Table 47). All of these sites consist of one or more points
recovered from the surface or in mixed contexts.
Archaic
The transition from the Paleoindian into the Archaic is marked by a much drier
environment (Prikryl 1990:69), which allowed for the expansion of prairie habitats from
the west. This period also demonstrates an increased diversification of types of notched
projectile points such as Gary, Kent and Godley. Evidence from other Early Archaic sites
reveal highly mobile foraging groups concentrated in the uplands away from major
drainages and utilizing expedient lithic technology (Anderson 1996:157-160). The
archaeological record of the Middle Archaic reveals that occupational patterns were
concentrated in the major river basins of the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savannas, and
had limited use of the smaller tributaries and headwater areas (Thurmond 1990). Sites
from this period are typically open campsites with a variety of distinctive blade-notched
stone hunting tools, generalized cutting and scraping tools, groundstone tools and cores
(Perttula 2004). The occurrence of burned rock features increases, suggesting that an
increase in cooking and plant processing was a more important activity for their
subsistence. Late Archaic archaeological sites in the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna
are typically found along major streams near springs on upland ridges.
Early Ceramic
The Woodland period, also referred to as the Early Ceramic period, is marked by the
occurrence of plain and thick walled ceramic bowls, flowerpot-shaped jars, double-bitted
axe heads, smaller and thinner projectile points such as Gary points and corner-notched
arrow points (Thurmond 1990). Evidence from sites dating to the Woodland period
suggests the introduction of horticulture to the region, yet these people probably
maintained a relatively mobile hunting and gathering lifestyle (Perttula 2004:377). It was
the Woodland period when burials appear associated with semi-permanent occupation
areas. Burial mounds dating to the Woodland period have been documented in the
Angelina, Neches and Sabine River basins in deep east Texas. These burials are usually
found on blufftops and alluvial valley settings (Perttula 2004:377). The wide variety of
non-local raw materials and artifacts associated with these sites also suggests long
distance trade networks. Additionally, cultures and traditions from the Lower Mississippi
Valley (LMV) are recognized in the Sabine area by the presence of their ceramic types;
these cultures include Tchefuncte, Marksville, Coles Creek (Story 1990).
Late Prehistoric
Archaeological information from the Formative, Early and Middle Caddoan periods
greatly increases in this region during these periods (Perttula 2004). Evidence of the rich
cultural tradition from this period is found in ethnohistorical records and archaeological
sites contain beautifully decorated ceramics, earthen mounds, well-preserved villages and
hamlets. Caddoan sites are typically situated on alluvial terraces and rises, natural levees,

and upland edges along major and minor streams and spring fed branches. Permanent
settlements with residential structures, cemeteries and refuse middens comprise the
majority of archaeological evidence for occupation during this period. Extensive research
has been done on many of these sites, as well as excavations of burial mounds and
residential areas, which has led to a better understanding of these people. The artifact
assemblages from sites speak of the rich material culture within these regions. Cornernotched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points, siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators
and borers, expedient scrapping and cutting tools, ceramic pipes, earspools and figurines
have all been recovered from excavations in these regions. A wide variety of ceramics is
also associated with sites from these periods and includes, but is not limited to, engraved,
incised, punctuated, neck banded, brushed and stamped varieties. Caddoan settlements
from this period are widely distributed throughout the major river basins (Perttula 2004).
The Plaquemine culture or Coles Creek-Plaquemine tradition, an LMV culture that
developed out of the earlier Coles Creek, also shows its presence through material culture
in the lower Sabine River area (Story 1990; Jeter and Williams 1989).
Historic
Historic interactions between native populations in this region are marked by the arrival
of the Europeans in the sixteenth century (Freeman 1990). Spanish conquistadors were
the first to explore the area and interact with these native populations. Shortly after the
Spanish, the arrival of French explorers marked the seventeenth century by the
occurrence of the first colonies in the coastal region. Sites from Nacogdoches County,
Texas have reported late eighteenth century through early nineteenth century evidence of
log structures associated with European ceramics of that time (Freeman 1990:378-380).
Other sites from the early nineteenth century have yielded gun parts, gunflints and glass
trade beads (Gilmore 1986). Between 1821 and 1865, European immigration into the area
greatly increased and native populations were forced to relocate. Large land grants were
given to settlers to encourage settlement of the area, and archaeological sites are typically
farmsteads and plantations (Freeman 1990).
Planters from the South first settled what today is the City of Kilgore during the Civil
War, although it did not become a town until 1872. In the same year, the InternationalGreat Northern Railroad built a line between Longview and Palestine, which passed
through Kilgore. The town was named after Constantine Buckley Kilgore who sold the
174-acre town site to the railroad. The post office opened in 1873 and the city appeared
to be growing prosperous. However, the Great Depression and the decline in cotton
created hard times for the residents of Kilgore, and many people left. The oil boom in the
1930s provided a growth spurt for Kilgore. The oil boom began to decline in the mid1930s even though oil production continues in the town today. By the 1960s the
population and business stabilized and that trend continues today. Kilgore boasts of the
East Texas Oil Museum and the famed Kilgore Rangerettes who are from Kilgore
College.

A review of the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (TASA) shows that there are 12 sites
within a three-mile radius of the project area. Advocational archaeologists like Jack
Hughes recorded several of these sites in the mid 20th century (TASA 2009). Two
prehistoric sites (41GG3 and GG10) are approximately 1 mile to the northeast of the
project area. 41GG3 is a probably a historic Caddo site where 19 burials, whole pottery
pipes, trade beads, steel knives, projectile points and various other artifacts were
recovered in the floodplain of Rabbit Creek. The site has been developed now as a pipe
company and pump station. Other sites shown on Figure 2 that are not associated with a
survey consist of prehistoric campsites and historic farmsteads and trash dumps.
The closest archaeological survey near the project area was conducted in 2004 by ARC
around Elder Lake in Synergy Park (Todd and Trask 2004). The survey examined 4500
feet of trail around the lake edge and no prehistoric or historic cultural materials were
located within the route. However, a historic site was recorded outside the area-ofpotential effect. This was the remains of the Elder Family home (41GG100) and it was
determined not to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a
State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
Additionally, a survey was conducted in 2005 by Deep Texas Archeological Consultants
of a sewage treatment plant and discharge pipeline that crossed Bighead Creek, a
tributary of Rabbit Creek (Galan 2005). The survey evaluated 9.7 hectares for the facility
and 2750 meters of pipeline and discovered no cultural resources. Another linear study
was conducted along a proposed route for US 259 around Kilgore (SDHPT 1986) and
recorded no cultural resources near the project area, however on the southern terminus of
the route a historic log cabin was recorded in Rusk County.
To the east of the project area, the Texas Water Development Board conducted a linear
survey of proposed collection lines along two intermittent tributaries of Rabbit Creek
(Whitsett 1976). The survey did not locate any cultural materials. Later the Texas Water
Development Board conducted a large block study on the northeast side of Kilgore (Fox
and Jurgens 1981). This survey revisited one site (41GG2) and recorded three new sites
(41GG28, GG29 and GG30). Two of these sites are approximately 1 mile from the
project area above Rabbit Creek; both are undated prehistoric campsites consisting of
projectile points, lithic debris and potsherds. No further work was recommended for
41GG28. In 2004, a survey sponsored by Lexington Court Ltd. revisited site 41GG2 and
found that it had been destroyed by urban development (Moore 2004).
One additional block study was conducted approximately 3 miles north of the project
area that recorded one prehistoric site and one multi-component site. This block survey
was conducted on the banks of the Sabine River in 1996 for the Pinehill Landfill (Turpin
1996). 41GG41 is an open prehistoric campsite that consisted of secondary and tertiary
flakes, while 41GG42 is an open campsite with a historic dump. No further investigations
were recommended for either site.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The Synergy Park Street Improvements are located in an upland area that is dissected by
two intermittent drainages of Rabbit Creek. Despite modern logging and agricultural
practices that have occurred in the area, the project had potential for both prehistoric and
historic cultural resources. Two research questions below were developed to examine the
potential of the study area.
Previous investigations have shown that prehistoric sites are concentrated along Rabbit
Creek. While all of these are concentrated along the main branch of the creek, temporary
campsites could be found on its tributaries. Due to the small size of these drainages, such
sites are more likely to be temporary hunting camps and would consist of artifact or lithic
scatters, as is the case for sites from the surrounding the area.
Historic sites exist in the vicinity of the project area. These consist of a farmstead and
historic trash scatter. The setting in which these sites were found is essentially farm and
pasture lands. The small, rural nature of the communities and the fact that the area has
been used for agricultural and logging activities since the 19th century makes it unlikely
to find intact historic sites. If sites are found, they are likely to be standing or collapsed
structures or historic trash artifact scatter associated with farming activity found along
drainages.
Methodology
The field team walked two parallel transects spaced 15 meters apart and made notes
about the ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed areas where subsoil
was exposed. Photographs were taken along the route using a Canon PowerShot SD600
2.0 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel tests were excavated on an average of every 100
meters following the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) guidelines (2002). Shovel
tests were excavated to the sterile subsoil and averaged 30 cm in diameter (CTA 2002).
The compact clays from the shovel tests were manually broken and inspected visually in
order to determine if cultural materials were present. Sandy soils from the shovel tests
were screened through ¼” hardware cloth. Shovel test matrices were described on the
basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific
soil colors in each test. The shovel test locations were determined with a handheld
Garmin GPSmap76 receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into two sections with the description of the survey area along
the route followed by the survey results. Shovel tests will be described briefly within the
text and are detailed in Appendix 1. The conclusions end the chapter.
Survey Area
The terrain throughout the study area ranged from gently rolling to deep valleys around
the intermittent tributaries of Rabbit Creek at each end of the route. Vegetation was
typically of the Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest with numerous young and old pine trees,
oaks, greenbriar and poison ivy (Figure 3). The majority of the pine trees were very
young, suggesting that the trees had been harvested in the recent past. Ground visibility
ranged from 0 to 90 percent throughout the study area. On the southern end of the spur
from the main route, the area had been cleared and extensive land modifications had
occurred providing 100 percent ground visibility (Figure 4). At each of the mapped
tributaries, the terrain dropped 15 to 50 feet before reaching the level ground surrounding
the drainages. Water was flowing in the shallow channels, but was probably due to the
recent weeks of rainfall in the surrounding area. These drainages were approximately a
meter wide and 30 to 50 centimeter deep and are probably dry most of the year (Figure
5). Along the sides of the steep creek banks were large exposures of sandstone (Figure 6).

Survey Results
The team walked parallel transects from the southwestern end to the northeast then out
the small spur from the main route. A total of 17 shovel tests were excavated in areas
where ground visibility was less than 30 percent (Figure 6). Shovel tests were placed on
an average of every 100 meters. Approximately, 80 percent of the main route followed an
abandoned two-track road and shovel tests were placed on either side of this road in areas
of least disturbance (Figure 7). The route had been staked and flagged with pink flagging
tape. The A horizon was similar in the majority of the shovel tests and consisted of a dark
brown to pale brown very fine sandy loam. This horizon varied in depth from 7 to 70+
cm thick and was on top of yellowish red to red clay subsoil or sandstone. The subsoil or
bedrock was reached at depths between 15 and 50 cm below the surface. Several of the
shovel tests contained large amounts of sandstone gravels that ranged in diameter from
pea to baseball size. No historic or prehistoric cultural resources were recovered from any
of the shovel tests or noted on the surface.

Conclusions
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the project area contained significant
historic or prehistoric resources. In particular, prehistoric sites were expected on
elevations adjacent to the drainages. The absence of prehistoric sites may be due to the
location of the area, situated near the upper end of the watershed. Existing sites tend to
occur along larger streams. Because the study area has been used and inhabited by
farming communities, historic sites were also expected. Several have been recorded in the
vicinity; and range from farmsteads to trash dumps consisting of artifact scatters of glass
bottles, cans, nails, and like objects. However, no significant archaeological remains were
found during the pedestrian survey.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the negative results of the pedestrian survey, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that the Synergy Park Street be allowed to proceed. If cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately cease in that area and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified. Work
should not continue until discussions with the proper agency have been concluded.
