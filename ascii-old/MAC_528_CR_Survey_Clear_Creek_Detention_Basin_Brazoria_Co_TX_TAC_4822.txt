ABSTRACT
On February 2, and March 10, 2008, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resource survey investigation for a proposed detention basin along Clear Creek in the city of
Pearland, Brazoria County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations were
conducted for Freese and Nichols, Inc., for the City of Pearland, under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4822. An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface (shovel test and backhoe trench) examination. A total of 16
shovel tests and four backhoe trenches were excavated. The excavations revealed the presence of
truncated natural soils and significant layers of fill in the western half of the tract, while the
eastern half appeared to be undisturbed. No evidence of archeological or historic remains or
features was identified by either the shovel tests or the backhoe trenches. Consequently, no
further archeological investigations are recommended. In the event that archeological deposits or
features should be encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

kidney-shaped area located within a bend of
Clear Creek. The project is in preparation
for the construction of a 10 acre detention
basin.

On February 2, and March 10, 2008,
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation for a proposed detention basin
along Clear Creek in the City of Pearland,
Brazoria County, Texas. The objectives of
the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 07113) were conducted for Freese and Nichols,
Inc., for the City of Pearland, under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 4822.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the current project area was conducted,
and included both surface and subsurface
(shovel
test
and
backhoe
trench)
examination. A total of 16 shovel tests (STs
1-16) and four backhoe trenches (BHTs 1-4)
were excavated. The field investigations
were conducted by project archeologist
Randy Ferguson and field technicians
Mamadou Cisse, Tsolo Dishaea, and Nadine
Johnson.
David Driver served as the
projectâs principal investigator.

The project area is depicted on the

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Hydrology
The project area is located on Clear
Creek. The creek is a major area stream
which flows east into Galveston Bay. In the
areas near the current project, the natural
course of the creek appears to have included
extensive meanders, but a review of curated
USGS maps (1932, 1943, 1947, 1955, 1982)
indicates that significant portions of the
creek had been straightened and channelized
by as early as the 1940s.

Soils and Geology
Brazoria County is located within
the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Flora and Fauna
Brazoria County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. San Jacinto
County is situated within the pine-oak
subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the
dominant floral species of the pine-oak
forest subdivision as loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica). Hardwood forests are found
on lowlands within the Austroriparian and
are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra), and
other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as
well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss
(Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra).

The project area is located on the
inset on sheet 60 of the Soil Survey of
Brazoria County, Texas (Crenwelge et al.
1981). The single soil type present in the
project area is Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1
percent slopes (24). Lake Charles clay is
described as somewhat poorly (Crenwelge et
al. 1981:68). Lake Charles clay is classified
by Abbott (2001) as upland clayey ancient
(pre-Holocene) alluvium, and is considered
to represent an area of low probability for
containing deeply buried cultural materials.
Climate
The modern climate of the Brazoria
County study area consists of long, hot and
humid summers and warm winters
(Crenwelge et al. 1981:1-2).
Summer
temperatures average 81Â°F (27Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 55Â°F (13Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 52 inches
(132 cm).

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus

snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around

faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able

to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
Anglo-American settlement in the
Brazoria County area began in the early
1820s, with the arrival of eighty-nine
families of Austinâs Old Three Hundred
(Kleiner 1996). The earliest settlements
included Velasco (present day Surfside),
Bellâs Landing (East Columbia), Columbia,
and Brazoria. By the 1830s, lucrative cotton
farming made the areaâs plantation owners
some of the wealthiest citizens of the state.
County residents and settlements played
important roles in the Texas Revolution, and
by May of 1836, Velasco had become the
seat of the interim capital of the republic.
The county was established that same year,
with the town of Brazoria named its county
seat.
The present boundaries were
determined over the following two years
with the establishment of Fort Bend and
Galveston Counties.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

The countyâs economy continued to
revolve around cotton cultivation, resulting
in a heavy dependence on slaveholding. By
1860, 72 percent of the countyâs 7100 total
population consisted of black slaves.
Consequently, the end of the Civil War
brought widespread depression for the
countyâs economy, and resulted in
significant changes in both demography and
industry. While some plantations were
broken up into smaller farms and others

1996:710). By 1871, the introduction of
convict labor aided in the economic
recovery of the region. In addition, by the
late 1870s, the growing cattle industry
almost equaled that of agriculture

turned to pasture, some residents left the
county, moving to the Mexican state of Vera
Cruz. The primary crops became more
diversified, shifting to corn, grains, sweet
and Irish potatoes, fruits, wild grapes, as
well as cotton and sugar for export (Kleiner

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Archaeological Survey (McGuff and Cox
1973) in preparation for massive flood
control project that would enlarge and
rectify most of the streamcourse. The
project examined almost the entire length of
the creek, covering from just west of the
Fort Bend/Brazoria County line, all the way
to Galveston Bay. A total of 76 prehistoric
and 2 historic sites were identified. They
noted a bimodal distribution of sites
(McGuff and Cox 1973:2, Figure 1), with
concentrations located in the lower reaches
of the creek near Clear Lake (between miles
2-5), and in the upper reaches (between
miles 23-28). This latter group of sites was
located on terraces alongside an incise
meander, and consisted of 41 pimple mound
sites and four terrace sites (McGuff and Cox
1973:18-19). This area of concentration is
located near the current project area, its
westernmost site less than Â½ mile away.
They reported that no sites were located
west of this concentration, though they
attributed
this
lack
to
previous
channelization. A similar lack of occupation
for the upper portion of Clear Creek has
been reported by Howard et al. (1992).
They identified three types of sites (shell
middens, terrace sites, natural mound sites)
that corresponded to topographic and
environmental zones mapped along the
creek. Based on their geomorphological
assessment of the Clear Creek waterway,
there is an implication that the lack of sites
in the upper reaches is due more to the
relatively steep nature of the stream profile,
and the resultant increased surface erosion
(Howard et al. 1992:4).

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that while no previously recorded
archaeological sites are located within the
project area, a large number of archeological
sites (41BO 182, 41GV46, 41GV49,
41HR84, 41HR161, 41HR162, 41HR163,
41HR192, 41HR195) have been previously
recorded within Â½ kilometer of the tract.
The earliest work in the Clear Creek
area was conducted by avocational
archeologists during the 1950s (from
Howard et al. 1992). During the late 1960s,
a professional survey was conducted by the
Texas Archaeological Salvage Project
(Corbin and Hester 1968). The survey,
which was limited to the lower portion of
the stream, located 10 sites in Galveston
County. Beginning in the early 1970s, a
series of efforts by the Houston
Archeological Society examined a number
of locations in the region around Clear
Creek, and included both survey and
excavations at a number of sites (Aten et al.
1976; Chaffin-Lohse 1978; Hole 1974).

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
The fieldwork was conducted on
February 2 and March 10, 2008, and
consisted of a 100% pedestrian survey that
included systematic shovel testing, backhoe
trenching, and visual examination for
surface exposure of cultural materials
(Figure 2).

clayey fill layers mantling the western half
of the project area. The fill is most likely
the result of early creek channelization
and/or the construction of an older detention
basin located immediately west of the
current project. None of the shovel tests
produced cultural materials.

The project area is depicted on the
Friendswood, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1), and consists of a
kidney-shaped area located within a bend of
Clear Creek (Figure 2). The project is in
preparation for the construction of a 10 acre
detention basin. Vegetation in the project
area varies (Figures 3-5), with a natural,
moderate-density forest with underbrush in
the eastern half. In contrast, the western half
has been cleared of most trees and is
currently covered with wild grasses and
brush.

In order to search for the presence
of sites in deposits below the fill layers, four
backhoe trenches (BHT) were excavated
(Figures 7-12). The trenches were spaced
evenly across the project area, and each
measured around 5 m in length, and reached
between 1.2 and 2.0 m in depth. BHTs 1-3
were placed in the western half of the tract,
and documented stratigraphy similar to that
evidenced by the shovel tests, with the upper
layers composed of fills and disturbed zones
overlying what appeared to be deeper, intact
clayey subsoils.
In BHTs 1-3, the
uppermost natural sediment strata appeared
to have been truncated prior to the
introduction of the fill deposits. BHT 4,
placed in the eastern end of the tract,
documented an intact natural soil profile,
and a lack of introduced fills. No cultural
materials or features were revealed in any of
the backhoe trenches.

A total of 16 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 6;
Appendix 1). The location of each test was
recorded and plotted on the project map.
Although a few of the shovel tests reached
what appeared to be the natural subsoils, at
least nine of the tests (STs 4-6, 8-12, 14)
documented the presence of substantial

examination. A total of 16 shovel tests and
four backhoe trenches were excavated. The
excavations revealed the presence of
truncated natural soils and significant layers
of fill in the western half of the tract, while
the eastern half appeared to be undisturbed.
No evidence of archeological or historic
remains or features was identified by either
the shovel tests or the backhoe trenches.
Consequently, no further archeological
investigations are recommended. In the
event that archeological deposits or features
should be encountered during construction,
work should cease in the immediate vicinity
and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

On February 2, and March 10, 2008,
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation for a proposed detention basin
along Clear Creek in the City of Pearland,
Brazoria County, Texas. The objectives of
the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
