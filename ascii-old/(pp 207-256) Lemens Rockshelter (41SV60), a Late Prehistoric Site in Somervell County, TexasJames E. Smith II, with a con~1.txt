Lemens Rockshelter (41SV60),
A Late Prehistoric Site in
Somervell County, Texas

James E. Smith H

with a contribution by
Patrieia M. Landau and Gail A. Colby

ABSTRACT

Two Late Prehistoric burials, one with grave goods, were recovered from
a small rock shelter in Somervell County, Texas, by a Steward of the Office of
the State Archeologist. The grave goods consisted of bone and lithic tools,
polished pebbles, modified mussel shell, and a broken Scallorn projectile
point. Additional excavations in the shelter suggested that the primary use of
the shelter was as a hunting camp. A cache of flint cores and flakes that are
associated with a Toyah occupation was also recovered.

INTRODUCTION
In the fall of 1990, Mr. Don Lemens contacted the Office of the State
Archeologist (OSA) concerning a human burial with grave goods that he had
discovered in a rockshelter located on the property owned by his brother Mr. O.
Z. Lemens. Bob Mallouf, State Archeologist, contacted the author, who is part
of the Stewardship network of the OSA, to investigate the find.
During the initial site visit, it was learned the Mr. Lemens was excavating
the shelter in 6-inch levels, but had maintained no formal horizontal provenience. It was also understood that Mr. Lemens wanted the burial removed, but
intended to continue his excavations in the shelter. The importance of documenting a burial containing grave goods, as well as the potential loss of that information, led to the decision by OSA to excavate the burial and then for the author
to continue with the excavation of the shelter.

LOCATION
The Lemens Rockshelter (41SV60) is located about 15 km west of the town
of Glen Rose in Somervell County, Texas (Figure 1). The site is located in a
small overhang on the west side of a small header stream that drains into Brushy
Creek. The creek empties into the Bosque River, which in turn empties into the
Brazos River just north of Waco. The small stream valley is moderately covered with juniper and live oak trees, with various prairie grasses covering the
open areas.

GEOLOGY AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Somervell County is in the Western Cross Timbers (Dyksterhuis 1948;
Texas Almanac 1990). It is a high rolling and hilly area with limestone formations deeply cut by the Brazos and Paluxy rivers. Average rainfall is 32 inches
per year, and the average temperature ranges between 32 and 98 degrees F
(Texas Almanac 1990).
The geological setting for the Lemens site is different from the nearby
Brazos and Paluxy river valleys. In the northern part of Somervell County, the
prominent geologica! stratum is the Glen Rose formation. This is a part of the
Trinity Group (100 m.y. ago), assigned to the Comanche series of Cretaceous
age. The Trinity Group was deposited as the muddy bottoms of warm, shallow
coastal seas. These muds have solidified into marl and limestone that have been
eroded to form the topography of the valleys.
In the southwest corner of the county, where the Lemens site is located, the
Fredericksburg Limestone formation is preserved. Erosion has removed the upper Cretaceous, and much of the lower Cretaceous, but part of the Fredricksburg
formation remains overlying the Trinity Group. The preservation of the
Fredricksburg formation in the higher areas is due to the very hard limestone that
protects the underlying shales and marls from erosion (Sheldon 1979:115). This
gives rise to the topography of flat-topped hills where the site is located. The
Edwards Formation within the Frericksburg produces Edwards chert, the primary
lithic resource for the site. This is one of the northernmost occurences of the
Edwards chert (Sellards et al. 1932:339).

DESCRIPTION OF SITE
The site is located on the west side of a small gully that has eroded through
the limestone cap approximately 20 m from its head. The gully has also eroded a
small depression into the bedrock which holds water for a short period of time
after rainfall.
The gully at the shelter is approximately six m wide. The shelter is ten m
long (due north) and a maximum of four m wide in an east-west direction (see

The bedrock floor of the shelter slopes outward with an average deposit depth
of 85 cm along the drip line.

EXCAVATION
When controlled excavations were begun by the author, one skeleton, along
with four items associated with the burial, had already been exposed by Mr.
Lemens. Since the rockshelter opens to the east, the base line was established
with a north-south orientation (see Figure 1). An arbitrary N100/W100 point
was established in the southern end of the shelter. The grid was adjusted to completely include the first burial in a lxl m unit. The northeastern corner of all
units was used as the unit designation. A vertical datum of 100.00 m was established using a temporary datum driven in a large juniper tree adjacent to the
shelter. The surface of the shelter was established at 99.49 m in elevation. All
soil matrix in the units was screened through one-quarter inch hardware mesh.
Mr. Lemens had been excavating the shelterâs deposits in in 6-inch levels,
screening all the dirt through one-quarter inch screen, and saving all materials.
However, only the recognizable projectile points and stone tools had been separated by levels. Approximately 60 percent of the shelter had been excavated in
this manner prior to our removal of the burial. Since vertical control had previously only been approximate, the remainder of the excavations were done using
the metric system in 10 cm arbitrary levels (the initial excavation levels were
converted into metric measurements for purpose of discussion). No natural or
cultural zones were observed in the shelterâs deposits.
The top 20 cm of the shelter fill was essentially sterile, with only the occasional recovery of lithic debris. Temporally diagnostic artifacts (arrowpoints
and dart points) were found between 20-60 cm; level 7 was reached in only one
unit, but no temporally diagnostic material was recovered.

FEATURES
Two separate burials, one adult and one child (see Appendix A for osteological analyses), were discovered along with a large rock concentration and a
lithic cache (see Figure 1). The burials were 1 meter apart in the northern end
of the shelter. Both burials occur in deposits that are thought to date to the Late
Prehistoric Austin phase.
The large rock concentration was in the southern half of the shelter, with
the cache of cores and flakes just to the south. The age of the rock concentration is unknown, but the cache appears to be associated with a Toyah phase
occupation of the shelter. Although burned rock was present in the shelter, no
formal hearth areas were discovered.

Burial 1
Burial 1 was an adult male, 35-45 years old, uncovered by Don Lemens and
excavated by the author and the Steward Action Team. It was located in unit
N109/W100, with the top of the skull at 98.86 meters in elevation, about 63 cm
bs. The burial was in a flexed position with the head to the north and face to the
west (Figure 2), with the rest of the body lying between 98.53-98.67 m. It had
been placed on the bedrock of the shelter and covered with an extremely large
rock cairn. Although evidence for a burial pit and matting was searched for, none
was found.
The cairn had been entirely removed before the author became involved in
the excavations. However, the four largest rocks identified as part of the cairn
ranged in size from 70 x 90 cm to 20 x 45 cm. One of these had been in a vertical position east of the burial but its burial placement could not be determined.
In addition, an undetermined number of smaller rocks were removed from the
cairn.
Burial 1 was excavated as a feature with vertical measurements taken as
needed to describe the character of the feature, but with no arbitrary division of
the fill into levels. During the excavation of the burial, a cache of grave offerings
was discovered adjacent to the flexed right tibia (see Figure 2) at an elevation of
98.66-98.70 m. The cache included 11 stone, antler, and bone tools. In addition, a
broken Scallorn point was found lying flat 5 cm from the right tibia, and two
polished stone pebbles were found lying near but behind the spinal column. A
bone fishhook found prior to formal excavations may also have been part of the
grave offerings given its proximity to the burial.

ADULT BURIAL GRAVE GOODS
Lithic Tools
Bifacial Tools
Three bifaciat tools were recovered in association with Burial l; one was
directly on top of the right tibia while the other two were between the femur and
tibia of the right leg (see Figure 2). All appear to have been made from a gray
Edwards Chert material from the same source (Larry Banks, 1993 personal
communication).
Biface 1 (Figure 3a): Maximum thickness, 4.8 mm; Maximum width, 38.1
mm; Maximum length, 83.3 mm; Weight, 27.4 g.
Description: Well-chipped but with knots on both sides due to the poor
quality of the chert material. Several attempts were made to try to remove the
knots, but they were not successful. There is no indication of use along the biface
edges.

Figure 3. Bifacial Grave Goods: a, Biface l ; b, Biface 2; c, Biface 3.

Scallorn Point
A broken Scallorn point (Figure 4a) was found 5 cm from the tibia of the
right leg and â2 cm from the nearest tool associated with the graVe offerings (see
Figure 2). The projectile, missing the tip, was lying fiat on the bedrock at 98.69
m in elevation. Maximum length, unknown; Maximum width, 14.0 mm; Maximum thickness, 2.9 mm; Stem width, 6.3 ram; Basal width, 10.1 ram.

Polishedpebbles

Two highly polished pebbles (Figure 4d-e) were recovered from an area
approximately 8 cm behind the skeletonâs pelvic region at an elevation of 98,57
m. One pebble is triangular in shape while the other is roughly rectangular. Both
have polish over all pebble surfaces, except for the deepest irregularities, and
such a high degree of polish on such small stones suggests constant wear. The
pebbles may have been rattle stones (or possibly fetish stones) attached to a
pouch and worn at the waist. The pebbles weigh 2.5 g and 2.9 g.

Hammerstone

A purple quartzite cobble used as a hammerstone wag found on top of the
left leg (elevation of 98.68 m). Wear patterns on both ends occurred predominantly on one side of the hammerstone. To hold the tool and strike an object in
such a way as to produce this use pattern would require holding the tool in the
left hand (Figure 5b). Damage along one edge of the hammerstone appears to

be from abrading, due probably to dulling the striking edge before using it to
remove a flake. Maximum length, 77 ram; Maximum width, 50 mm; Weight,
194 g.

Bone/Antler
Antler Tines
Seven antler tines were recovered in the tool cache around the lower legs
of the adult burial. Although rodent gnawing has removed the tip from one of
the tines all are classified as tools. These specimens may have been held in a
pouch that was placed in the grave at the time of the burial since they were all
oriented with their beak to the east.
Awl: One antler awl has high use polish on the tip (Figure 6b). Curved
length, 176 mm; Maximum diameter, 17.6 mm; Weight, 23.1 g.
Punches: Two tines appear to have been used for punching activities. Both
tines have spalls removed from the proximal end that may have been a result of
blows from some type of "hammer." These ends have a flattened appearance .
(Figure 7b, c). Spalls have also been removed from the distal ends, possibly from
impact on the target object. Both distal ends contain smoothed, slightly polished
areas around the circumference of the artifact. The polishing extends 11 mm
from the tip on Punch 1 and 21 mm from the tip on Punch 2.
Punch 2 has a 2 mm wide quartzite or chert chip tightly imbedded in the
bone 25 mm from the distal end. No attempt has been made to remove it. The
proximal end of this tool is heavily battered and compacted.

Punch 2 (Figure 7c): Length, 61 mm, Maximum diameter, 19.2 mm;
Weight, 14.1 g.
Antler Flakers: Two definite and two probable antler flakers were among
the burial offerings. Two of the tines (Flaker 1 and 2) show wear at the tip
consistent with use as flaking tools. A third (Flaker 3) is very similar in size and
shape but had the tip removed by rodent gnawing. The fourth possible flaker tool
has wear on the distal end but it is not battered nor does it have spalls removed
from either end. Two cut marks are present between 20 and 30 mm from the
distal end, and have a "v" shaped profile that may be intentional.
One tine has a very straight edge along the proximal end where it had been
detached. This may be the result of a groove and snap method of detachment. No
such straight breaks are present on the other flakers.
Flaker 1 (Figure 7a): Curved length, 154 ram; Maximum diameter,
18.3 ram; Weight, 17.9 g.

21.5 ram; Weight, 26.9 g.

Bone Tools
Ulna Tools: Two deer ulna flakers and one unidentified left ulna tool were
also among the bone implements recovered from the Lemens site. The tips were
uniformly gnawed off, however some polish wear was evident along the edges of
the pieces. The unidentified ulna (Ulna 3) is rather thin to have been a flaking
tool, but its function is unknown.
Ulna 1 (Figure 8a): Thickness at tip, 3.9 mm; Weight, 9.5 g.
Ulna 2 (Figure 8b): Thickness at tip, 4.6mm; Weight, 11 g.
Ulna 3 (Figure 8c): Thickness at tip, 1.9 mm; Weight, 4 g.

Fishhook

One complete fishhook made from a deer phalange (see Figure 4c) was
found by Mr. Lemens directly behind the neck area of Burial 1. Whether this
was part of the grave offerings or part of the burial fill is unknown. Maximum
length, 39 mm; maximum width, 6 mm.

Freshwater Mussell Shell
One freshwater mussell shell was lying vertically inside the flexed left leg.
Its edge had been reduced, presumably through use, along the entire margin,
and may have been used as a hide scraper (see Figure 5a). Maximum length, 91
ram; Maximum width, 43 mm; Maximum thickness; 15 ram; Weight, 19.1 g.

Burial 2
Burial 2 is an infant approximately four years old. It was located in unit
N108/W100, 1 m to the south of Burial 1, between 98.65-98.72 m elevation,
about 75-84 cm bs. The burial appears to be a very careful reburial with possible grave offerings.
The remains were incomplete, consisting of portions of the skull, jaw, ribs,
and long bones. The bones were not placed in a bundle, but rather positioned to
approximate the correct skeletal orientation; that is, the fragmented skull was
placed to the west, the jaw fragment was in the middle, and the long bones, ribs,
pelvis, and other skeletal materials were placed together to the east (Figure 9).
From the appearance of the remains, the infant had died elsewhere, and
had been exposed to the elements until the bones were clean. The remaining
skeletal material was then collected and buried in the shelter as a secondary
interment. How most of the bones were lost is not known, although there was
no indication of rodent chewing on the bones.
The burial was carefully laid out on the bedrock. Six fist-sized rocks were
placed together to support two large flat rocks that overlay the skull and jaw (at
an elevation of 98.92 m) and prevented these being crushed. Various small rocks
that were part of the cairn were placed around the lower portion of the infant to
form a "cup" in which the lower bones were placed. No burial pit outline was
observed.
An unbroken and unmodified freshwater mussel shell was recovered lying
on the bedrock adjacent to the rock cairn. It may be associated with the child
burial. A broken Scallorn arrowpoint was recovered from the same area but was
not found in situ and thus cannot be directly associated with Burial 2.

Lithic Cache

A cache of cores and flakes was located in level 3 of units N 102W 101 and
N 101W 101 (see Figure 1). The cache consisted of nine cores and 44 flakes. The
cores had been deposited in a 30 cm diameter circle with the flakes placed in
two layers inside the circle. Each of the cores had one to three flakes removed,
but none of these were among the ones found in the cache. The cache flakes
appear to have been removed from a minimum of eight other cores that were
not recovered in the shelter excavations. The cores in the cache are river cobbles
of Edwards Chert.
A scraper beak had been formed on the end of one flake, and two others
exibited intentional retouch along one margin. The shallow depth of the cache
suggests an association with a Toyah phase zone found in the north end of the
shelter although no diagnostic artifacts were found near the cache. A complete
report on this feature is in preparation by the author.

Rock Concentration
In the south end of the shelter a very large limestone rock concentration
covered about six m2. The depth of the concentration varied according to the
distance to bedrock with the top exposed about 24 cm bs, and it became thicker
as the floor of the shelter sloped outward. The maximum depth of the feature
was 70 cm bs in unit N105N99. This unit was a!ong the drip line of the shelter
(see Figure 1), but was not excavated to bedrock due to lack of time; little cultural material was recovered.
Most of the feature volume was rock, along with one burned sandstone
metate fragment in Unit N 105W99 near two large upright rocks. The metate was
utilized on one face and measures 12 x 9 x 4 cm in size. A single human tooth
was recovered at the base of the second vertical slab.
The purpose or function of this rock concentration is unknown. It is not a
natural accumulation from rock fall or washing from the top of the shelter. There
is no evidence that it post-dates the aboriginal occupation of the shelter, and in
tact it appears to have been placed there during the Austin Phase. (Prehistoric
burials found in the Abilene area are sometimes found covered with enormous
rock cairns. The cairns were so large that the excavators were convinced that
they were not cultural. Further investigations were necessary to find the burials
under the cairns.)

ARTIFACTS
The chipped stone artifacts recovered from Lemens were made from a
source of Edwards chert that outcrops in the hills near the site and is also available in the form of river cobbles in Paluxy and Brazos river gravels. There is no

Smith -- Lemens Rockshelter

221

indication that the raw material was heat treated. The major artifacts recovered,
other than debitage, were projectile points and spall scrapers.

Arrowpoints
Perdiz

A total of nine identifiable Perdiz arrowpoints were recovered from the site
(Figure 10b, j, w-x). Seven of the Perdiz were found in level 3 while the others
came from levels 4 and 5 (Table 1). Many of the Perdiz arrowpoints show
breakage typical of point impacts (Cox and Smith 1991). Mean Length: 24.03
mm; range:18.7-27.9 mm. Mean width: 15.33 mm; range: 13.4-17.3 mm. Mean
thickness: 3.09 mm; range: 1.8-3.7 mm. Maximum stem width: 5.33 mm; range:
4.4-7.0 mm.

Scallorn

A total of 40 Scallorn arrowpoints were recovered from the site (Figure
10a, f-g, i, 1, o, u, z). Of these, 34 were from levels 4 and 5. Four Scallorn were
also apparently associated with the adult burial; one was in direct association
(see above) while three were in the grave fill immediately above the skeleton.
One specimen is made out of a well-worked gray quartzite, and the others were
from Edwards chert. Many show unintentional thermal fracturing. The majority
are broken in a manner consistent with impact damage. Mean Length: 26.12 mm;
range: 20.8-34.6 mm. Mean width: 14.13 mm; range: 10.5-20.3 mm. Mean
thickness: 3.40 mm; range: 2.5-4.1 mm. Neck width: 6.03 mm; range: 3.7-8.6
mm. Basal width: 8.37 mm; range: 615-11.4 mm.

Bonham
Three specimens were found in levels 2-4. All of the Bonham arrowpoints
have the slightly bulbar stem characteristic of the type (Figure 10m, n, y). Mean
length: 22.95 mm; range: 21.9-24.0 mm. Mean width: 12.93 mm; range: 11.714.0 mm. Mean thickness: 4.0 mm; range: 2.8-5.9 mm. Neck width: 5.13 mm;
range: 4.5-5.9 mm. Basal width: 5.47 mm; range: 4.4-6.4 mm.

Washita

Two Washita points were recovered in levels 3 and 4 (Figure 10e). One
appears to be of Edwards chert while the other is a tan chert. The latter specimen
is made on a flake with portions of the flake scar remaining on the piece. Mean
length: 21.8 mm; range: 19.4-24.2 mm. Mean width: 11.4 mm; range: 10.7-12.1

seven had triangular blades with convex edges and straight to convex bases. On
six of these seven, the side-notches were shallow. The seven had notches more
angled just above the corner of the piece; this may be a Scallorn variant. Mean
length: 23.43 mm; range: 20.0-25.0 mm. Mean width: 10.48 ram; range: 9.4-12.3
mm. Mean thickness: 3.38 mm; range: 2.7-3.8 mm. Neck width: 6.99 mm; range:
5.4-8.0 mm. Basal width: 9.79 mm; range: 5.4-t 1.9 mm.
The side-notched points came from levels 4-5 (see Table 1), the same levels
that produced the majority of the Scallorns, and may generally be associated with
the Austin phase occupation. The side-notched point resembling a Washita
arrowpoint came from level 5.

Cortter-notched

This point generally resembles the side-notched points described above
except that it has notches originating at the corners (Figure 10p). It is 20.9 mm in
length, 11 mm in width, 3.5 mm thick, 5.5 mm in neck width, and 10.0 mm in
basal width.

Hayes-like
The point is corner-notched with a bulbar to diamond shaped base and
straight sides (Figure 10q). The specimen was made from a brown chert that may
not be Edwards. It has been thermally altered, producing "pot lid" fractures on
both faces. A color difference noted on the proxima! third of the artifact may be a
result of differential heating. A fracture along the lateral edge of the blade may
be a result of impact. Length: 38.4 mm; Width: 5.0 mm; Thickness: 4.5 mm;
Neck width: 7.3 ram; Basal width: 3.8 mm.

Asymmetrical

One point has a triangular blade, deep corner notching, and a bulbous stem.
It is basically similar to the Perdiz type except for the bulbous stem. The body of
the artifact is noticably curved along its central axis of symmetry when lying flat
(Figure 10s). Length: 33.8 mm; Width: 5.1 mm; Thickness: 3.7 mm; Neck width:
4.2 mm; Basal width: 6.4 mm.

Miscellaneous
The first miscellaneous specimen has been deeply serrated. There are morphological resemblances to the Livermore type. Similar arrowpoint examples
have been identified in local collections from the Trinque (41ER27) and Rodeo
Hill sites.

Smith ~ Lemens Rockshelter

227

The second miscellaneous arrowpoint is badly burned, but its form is similar
to the previously discussed arrowpoint.

Broken
Seven distal arrowpoint fragments were found in the excavations, six of
which were from level four. Two midsection arrowpoint fragments were found in
level four, and of unknown provenience were two proximal sections.

Dart Points

Four dart points were recovered from the Lemens site: two of the Ellis type
and two Godley points. Three of the four dart points came from level 6, and the
other was found in level 4 (see Table 1).

Godley (Figure lOc.d)
Measurements: Thickness range: 5.5-6.1 mm; Length: both broken; Width
range: 19.0-19.3 mm; Neck Width range: 10.6-12.5 mm; Base Width range:
13.5-14.9 mm.

Ellis (Figure lOr, t)
Measurements: Thickness: 5.5-5.7 ram; Length: 28.5-37.0 mm; Width: 22.4
mm; Neck Width: 7.4-11.0 mm; Base Width: 14.5-16.4 mm.

Preforms
Eleven small and thinned bifacial preforms of Edwards chert were recovered (see Table 1 and Figure 1 ld-e). Three were ovate in outline, six were
triangular, and two were broken in manufacture and are unidentifiable as to form.
One ovate preform came from level 3; two ovate, two triangular, and one of
undetermined shape were recovered in level 4. The two preforms in level 5 were
of triangular and undetermined shapes. Thickness and width measurements (in
mm) are summarized below:

In addition to the bifacial preforms, two unifacial preforms were recovered
from unknown proveniences at the site. One had been roughly shaped to a form
resembling the Cliffton type. This may be an initial attempt to form a preform for
a Perdiz arrowpoint. The second unifacial preform has only the base formed by
flaking while the distal portion and mid-section of the specimen were not flaked.

perforator; h, ochre; i, quartz crystal.

Bifaces
A total of 24 bifacially flaked artifacts were present. These artifacts have
large, deep flake scars on both faces. They do not appear to represent finished
tools and are presumed to represent initial stages in lithic reduction. All of these
bifaces are of Edwards Chert.
Seven are proximal fragments, three are portions of midsections and ten
were represented only by distal fragments. Three of the complete bifaces came
from level 4 and the fourth from level 5.

Scrapers
Four scrapers were recovered in uncontrolled excavations in the north end
of the shelter. Relevant measurements for each of the specimens are: Scraper No.

Scraper No. 4: Flake length, 30 mm; Bit length, 13 mm.

Drills/Perforators
Four drills or perforators were recovered during the Lemens rockshelter
excavations (see Figure 1 If-g). One of the drills/perforators (from level 4), a tip
fragment, was well flaked to form the drill bit. The other two from that level were
unbroken flake drills that had minimal retouch/bifacial flaking to form the drill
bit; step flaking is evident along the bit margins on both drills. The drill from
level 3 was bifacially flaked to form an oval that came to a point at the drill tip.
The bit shows extensive step flaking along both lateral edges. All drills/perforators are made from Edwards Chert.

Burin
One burin was found from unknown provenience. The specimen had a
negative bulb of percussion along the thickest (4 mm) part of the flake, and
exhibited polish (visible under low power magnification) on one of the corners.

Retouched Flakes
Three flakes in the tool assemblage were intentionally retouched. Their
provenience is unknown. The retouched flakes are separated from the spall
scrapers by the length of the retouching along the flake edge. The specimens
were unifacially flaked with scars running 8 to 10 mm from the edge toward the
spine of the flake, and flaking was uniform along the worked edge.

Cores
Three exhausted cores were recovered with unknown provenience. Two
were from a local gray Edwards chert, and the third, a river cobble with red
cortex, was of a dark gray Edwards chert. All exhibit multidirectional flaking and
are extremely small, averaging 39 x 30 x 19 mm in size. Nine additional cores
were recovered from the lithic cache (see above).

Hammerstones
Two hammerstone fragments were recovered, both of unknown provenience. One, a 50 mm diameter spall, is from a quartzite cobble. It is heavily
battered and has been burned to a gray color. The second is also a spall; it is of a

230

Texas Archeological Society

chert material. It measures 38 x 30 x 13 mm and has extensive edge damage from
battering.

Ochre
One thin (3.2 mm) and small (30.1 x 6.9 ram) piece of smooth red ochre
was recovered from the rock shelter by Don Lemens. The ochre is flat on both
sides with one surface exhibiting what appears to be peck marks (see Figure
t lh). No evidence of rubbing was observed on either face.

Quartz Crystal
A flat, pie-shaped quartz crystal was recovered from unknown site provenience (see Figure 1 li). The fragment, with an 11 mm radius, resembles one
quadrant of a circle. It is flat on both sides and 8 mm thick.

Bone Artifacts
FishHook
One broken fish hook (see Figure 4c) was recovered from level 4 in the
shelter. The hook portion is identical to the one recovered by Mr. Lemens in
possible association with the adult burial. Most of the shank is missing from the
piece; it is 7 mm in maximum width.

Unidentified Bone Tool
A broken and 37.2 mm long bone tool was recovered from level 5. The
tool is smoothed and shows polish over its modified surface. The tip also has
some use damage. The thickness at the tip is 3.2 mm and the maximum thickness of the recovered portion is 4.2 ram. The bone is unidentifiable to element,
but a natural depression in the bone may indicate that the tool was formed from
a metapodial.

Ulna Flakers
Two deer ulna, one with the tip broken, were recovered from unknown
provenience in the shelter. The smaller shows use modification. The tip of the
larger ulna flaker is broken and consequently no modification is visible on the
piece.

Debitage
Three thousand six hundred eighty pieces of discarded chipping debris (here
termed debitage) were recovered from the site (Table 2). These represent the
various stages of tool manufacture and maintenance that occured at the site. The
following definitions were used in the analysis:
Flake

Having a bulb of percussion or force

Chip

Bulb of percussion or force missing

Primary

Cortex covering I00 percent of exterior

Secondary

Cortex covering less than 100 percent of exterior

Tertiary

No cortex remaining on flake.

Debitage classified as flakes were described using four parameters: size,
platform type, lipping flake, and thermal alteration:

Size:
Measurement was taken along the major axis of the spall
Very Small: Less than 1 cm
Small: Greater than or equal to 1 cm. and less than or equal to 2 cm
Medium: Greater than 2 cm and less than or equal to 4.5 cm
Large: Greater than 4.5 cm
PlaOCorm type:
Single -- Platform with a single facet
Dihedral -- Platform with two facets
Multihedral -- Platform with more than two facets
Ground -- Platform was ground, forming a rounded margin. Any of the
other platform types could also be ground.
Cortex -- Natural Platform completly covered with cortex
Crushed -- Remnants of the platform were present, but not enough to
further categorize.
Lipped Flake:
The presence or absence of a lip containing part of the striking platform
of a biface. This flake typically has a multiple faceted platform and
edge grinding to prepare the striking platform.
Debitage showing no bulb of percussion are classified as chips. The only
parameters recorded for this category is the sequence of removal from the parent
core (Table 3) and whether the material has been thermally altered.
All flakes and chips were examined under low power (14-20X) magnification for edge damage due to use. Debitage found to have edge damage was
classified as spall scrapers (following Jelks [ 1962]).

The thermal alteration category includes any form of heat alteration, whether
it is intentional or not. Only 39 (2.55 percent) of the chips and 105 (4.88 percent)
of the flakes may have been intentionally heat treated. Even the specimens that
were classified as heat treated may only have been unintentionally subjected to

Smith -- Lemens Rockshelter

233

heat, and thus this technology was not significantly utilized by the occupants of
the Lemens shelter.
The low percentage of primary flakes suggests that the raw material being
brought into the shelter had already had some preliminary reduction (See Table
3). That only three cores were recovered from the main excavation also support
this suggestion.

Lipped Flakes
A total of 88 or 4:09 percent of the total flakes were classified as lipped
flakes. Of these, 56, or 63.64 percent, of the lipped flakes were ground to some
degree. Table 4 shows the types of platform preparation relative to the total
number of lipped flakes.

Experiments have shown that lipped flakes are produced at significantly
higher rates by soft-hammer percussion than by hard-hammer percussion (Watson
1982:63-64). Therefore, the relative frequency of lipped flakes may be an indicator of the use of a soft hammer in the assemblage. With only 4.09 percent of the
flakes being lipped, it appears that the use of a soft hammer was not an important
aspect of the lithic technology.

Very few large or medium-sized flakes were noted in the debitage (Table 5).
This probably indicates that the chert source was not a nearby outcropping, or
that they possibly curated the larger flakes for later use.

An analysis of flake platform types indicates that single facet and cortex
types are most common (Table 6). In addition to the platforms that are ground to
obliterate the flake scars, other platform types exhibited grindingi 1.0 percent of
the single facet platforms, 13.7 percent of the double facet platforms, 24.6
percent of the multifacet platforms, and 63.6 percent of the lipped flakes. The
large percentage of single facet platform flakes suggests that a flake technology
was used by the shelter occupants to produce flakes for shaping into finished
flake tools.

Spall Scrapers
Of the 3680 pieces of recovered debitage, 448 (12.17 percent) were found to
exhibit use edge damage. With this category of tool representing the most
frequent type of tool, it was thought that there may be a relationship between the
main activity (or activities) that took place at the shelter and the utilized debitage.
This debitage was analyzed using the criteria established by Tringham et a!.

Smith--âLemenS Rockshelter

235

(1974) and Gallagher and Bearden (1976). As a more detailed study of this tool
type is beyond the scope of this paper, the general results of the replication and
functional Studies are only summarized herein.
A total of 443 pieces of debitage had edges that had been utilized in some
activity by the Lemens site occupants. The other five were boring tools (see
Tringham et al. 1974:189, 192). Each edge was analyzed as a separate tool
(Table 7).

Activities Observed in the Flake Tools
Scraping~laning
Model: Unifacial edge damage with a short, non-scalloped bit.
A total of 365 tool edges had unifacial damage. Of these, 287 (78.7 percent)
had bit lengths less than 16 mm. Tools with unifacial edges have the largest
percentage of step flaking (45.8 percent) and unscalloped edges (69.9 percent).
There is no dominant microflaking type although 40.8 percent of the tools had
some form of small, shallow flakes.
There were 185 tools with both model attributes. Of these scraping/planing
tools, 90 or 48.6 percent had single or multiple step flaking present.
Some tools had step flaking only on the bottom edge of the piece that would
have been in contact with the target medium. This was a noticeable contrast to

236

Texas Archeological Society

other scraping/planing tools. Although no systematic attempt was made to
differentiate these tools from the other scraping/planing tools, these differences
may represent contrasting activity types based on the position of the step flaking.

Sawing
Model: Bifacial edge damage with irregular, scalloped edges. Bit lengths are
longer, and flake scars are larger and deeper, than scraping/planing tools.
A total of 176 tool edges have bifacial edge damage. Of these, 112 (63.6
percent) have bit lengths over 15 mm. Step flaking is not common (28.4
percent), and the tools have scalloped (48.3 percent) or even (36.4 percent)
edges. Microflakes removed through sawing tend to be irregular with semicircular flaking. Forty nine tools from Lemens have all the characteristics of
the model.

Cutting
Model: Bifacial edge damage with smaller, more irregular flake scars than
sawing tools.
Twenty-six of the specimens may represent cutting tools. As the model
suggests, they have bifacially flaked edges, and have smaller and shallower
flakes; bit lengths are over 15 mm.

Whittling
Model: Unifacial edge damage with uneven micro-flaking and frequently scalloped edges.
Fifty-three edges (8.1 percent) have characteristics of whittling. Of these,
26 had random unifacial flaking while an additional 10 had larger, deeper flakes
removed from one surface.

Undefined Use
An activity not described by either Tringham et al. (1974) or Gallagher and
Bearden (1976) was tools with attrition perpendicular to the flake edge. Forty
specimens had this characteristic, as well as evenly flaked and small, shallow,
evenly distributed edges. Another 43 tools had either one or the other of these
edge attributes.
Five other small specimens (average major axis length of 15 mm) are
classified as mini-spall scrapers. Two of the small scrapers have perpendicular
flaking along the edge, two more are unifacially flaked, and the other has a

Smith ~ Lemens Rockshelter

237

bifacially flaked edge. These small scrapers may have been used on detail and
delicate tasks.

Tools Used on Soft Material
Flakes with nibbled edges (N=59) may represent tool work on softer materials (e.g., Tringham et al. 1974:189). Some 38 (64.4 percent) of these flakes have
unifacial edges. Forty-one (69.5 percent) had bit lengths under 15 mm and 53
(89.8 percent) had no step flaking. Almost 97 percent of the specimens had very
small patterned microflaking.

Wood-working tools
A total of 182 of the used tool edges had convex edges possibly used in
working wood. The concave edge is a by,product of tool use, in many cases,
rather than an edge chosen for a particular function.

Notching saws
Eleven specimens were identified as notching saws (e.g, Sollberger 1969).
These tools were not over 3 mm in thickness (along the utilized edge) and had a
scalloped working edge, All of these specimens had some bifacial flaking and
scalloped edges.

Notches
Sixty-four of the spall scrapers were classified as notches. They ranged from
3,29 mm in notch diameter, but they clustered at 4,7 mm with 36 (56.3 percent)
of the specimens in this range. Multiple step flaking was common in the notched
tools. The size of most of the notches is consistent with the diameters of
arrowshafts and may represent a tool used at the final stage in finishing the shafts.

FAUNAL REMAINS
No in-depth analysis of the faunal remains from Lemens has been completed. A total of 1203 bone fragments were recovered from both the controlled
and noncontrolled excavations. Of that total only 283 Or 23.5 percent of the bone
could be identified to vertebrate class. Animals present in {he shelter include deer
(N=167), turtle (N=12), small animals such as squiwel, rabbit, and racoon (N=60),
and an assortment (N=44) of turkey, as well as small and large birds (including a
heron). Two fragments are large and thick enough to be biSon, but absolute
species identification was not possible.

238

Texas Archeological Society

A total of 497 (41.3 percent) of the faunal assemblege was burned. During
the controlled excavations, one area (Unit N106W99, level 3) exhibited a
significantly higher amount of burned faunal material than other parts of the site.
Intra-site activity areas may have been isolated if all the units had been excavated
in a controlled manner, but under the circumstances it was impossible to identify
these activity areas.

SHELL
Land snail shells were present in large numbers throughout the shelter
deposits. Representative examples were collected but no absolute shell counts
were made. Rabdotus alternatus was the most frequent land snail. Polygyra
texasiana was also present, but not in large quantities, nor was it as widely
distributed as the Rabdotus.
Freshwater mussel shell was saved only from the controlled excavations.
Fifteen fragments were recovered, but as previously mentioned, the only two
complete halves were found in association with the burials.

DISCUSSION AND INTER-SITE COMPARISONS
Site Typology and Settlement Patterns
Site typology and settlement pattern studies for the Brazos River area of
Central Texas have been discussed by Skinner (1971; Gallagher and Bearden
1976:82-107), and Henry et al. (1980:512-520). Their characterization of site
types is pertinent to determining the place of the Lemens rockshelter in regional
settlement systems.
Skinner (1971:265) suggests that sites in the DeCordova Bend Reservoir
(now Lake Granbury) project fit a "central-based wanderer" model. In this model
there are three site types: a multi-seasonal base camp, special activity lithic
procurement/chipping stations, and temporary hunting/gathering sites used by
nuclear or extended families.
Skinnerâs (1971) chipping stations (such as the Pirate site) were located on
the limestone bluffs where chert was available. Gravers, notches, and utilized
flakes were the only common chipped stone tools (Table 8).
Seasonal hunting/gathering camps were situated along the intermittent tributaries of the Brazos River where game, plant foods, and freshwater mussels were
seasonally available. Chipped stone tools other than utilized flakes were found in
low percentages. Analysis of the lithic debris indicates that initially-flaked materials were brought to the site for further reduction (Skinner 1971:161). Skinner
(1971:265) also suggests that rockshelters in the Whitney Reservoir were utilized
as seasonal hunting/gathering camps.

Base camps such as Lowden were located on alluvial terraces of major
streams and rivers. Grinding tools and projectile points are thought to be common,
although the projectile point frequency is rather low f?om the Lowden site (see
Table 8).
For our purposes, some of the best comparative data within the Lake
Whitney reservoir comes from the Bear Creek Rockshelter (Lynott 1978). The
shelter is located on a tributary to the Brazos River, and Lynott suggests it was a
temporary habitation site for small groups. The primary activity in the shelter
was tool manufacturing as well as hunting and animal food processing (Lynott
1978:97).
Henry et al. (1980:516-519) indicate the "central-based wanderer" model
does not fit the types of sites found near Waco in the Hog Creek valley. They
propose a "dispersed mode circulating model." In their model, there are no base
camps used by large numbers of people during the yearly cycle. Rather, there
are primary unit camps that exploit the resources of the valley on a year-round
basis.
Rockshelters are proposed as the primary unit camps for small groups of
people in the Hog Creek area, including Five Goat Shelter, Stone Rockshelter,
Windy Shelter, and L. E. Robertson. Windy Shelter has a northern exposure,
and may not have been utilized during the winter months. The inference that
rockshelters were primary encampments is based on their tool diversity, which
are dominated by bifaces, utilized pieces, and projectile points (see Table 8).
Groundstone artifacts, an abundance of faunal remains, and burials also indicate that a variety of activities occurred in the shelters. The initial reduction of
lithic raw materials was not conducted at the Hog Creek rockshelters.
Open sites in the Hog Creek valley, such as the Dam site, are quite similar to
the rockshelters in tools, and are thus also suggested to be primary unit camps for
perhaps nuclear or extended families (Henry et al; 1980). Scrapers, denticulates,
notches, and utilized pieces are common at both kinds of sites, but bifaces and
projectile points are not as frequent. Analysis of the lithic debris seems to
indicate that initial stages of tool reduction were carried out more often in open
sites than in the rockshelters (Henry et al. 1980:507)~"
Gallagher and Bearden (1976:90-94) note problems of intersite comparisons using Skinnerâs (1971) model within an overall discussion of the difficulty
in Central Texas site typology assignments. They suggest that the central-based
wandering model is too rigid since it views the DeCordova Bend Reservoir
unrealistically as a self-contained unit. A more pervasive problem noted by
Galiagher and Bearden (1976) is that of site chronology. Whether sites were
actually contemporaneous, and part of a behaviorally meaningful settlement
system, was not attempted; rather, contemporaneity was simply assumed to be
the case.
Noting significant differences between Whitney Reservoir sites in tool
assemblages, Gallagher and Bearden (1976) also question the validity of lumping
sites into categories such as short-term or base camp sites. In their opinion, too

242

Texas Archeological Society

many variables are poorly controlled to adequately and fully evaluate the data for
settlement pattern studies. They conclude that:
[t]he definition of total site size, total area of the site excavated, density
of the various morphological artifact types, total faunal assemblages
and vertical distribution of the various types . . . need to be reported
before a morphology of sites can be produced.
Artifact Assemblages and Site Characterization
While recognizing the difficulty in identifying site types and settlement
patterns from rather limited sets of archeological data, some examination of lithic
tool assemblages for Central Texas sites by possible "site types" is warranted
since diachronic tool kit changes have been found to be site-specific in some
cases; activity variation within sites seems to have also played a more important
role in determining tool-kit variability than did environmental change through
time (e.g., Henry et al. 1980:507). Henry et al. (1980:507-509) also noted a
strong correlation between site tool-kit variation and the fauna present in some of
the Hog Creek shelters.
Based on Skinner (1971), Lynott (1978), and Henry et al. (1980), a base
camp would serve a large group of people, possibly on a year-round basis. Those
kinds of sites would show that a wide range of activities occurred there. A
circulating primary unit site would be a seasonal base camp for smaller, perhaps
extended, family groups. They should also evidence a wide range of activities,
but be distinguished from a more permanent encampment only by the presence/
absence of certain features, seasonal activities, or by the density of artifactual
remains. A temporary site, primarily used for hunting/gathering, or lithic procurement, would not have had a wide range of activities. In addition, the frequency in which some activities that would have occurred in both temporary and
permanent camps would be significantly different. For example, if working
arrowshafts was a major activity in a temporary site, the percentage of woodworking tools would be higher than in a base camp that had a wider assortment of
activities.
The Late Prehistoric tool assemblage data from the above-mentioned sites
were selected for comparison. Three predominantly Late Archaic sites were also
included because of their suggested use as either base camps or temporary use
sites: Aiken, Bluebonnet, and Indian Springs. In each of the site assemblages,
scrapers, bifaces, projectile points, edge-utilized flakes, and notches comprise
over 91 percent of the flaked tools (see Table 8), and are considered the major
tool groups. The remaining tools consist of burins, drills, perforators, gravers,
etc., and are grouped in the "other" category.
The most noticeable difference in these data is in the frequency of utilized
flakes compared to the remainder of the stone tool assemblage(s). Possible
temporary sites have high utilized flake frequencies (over 64 percent) (Figure

12). Aiken, an Archaic site, had the lowest percentage (53.98 percent). Base
camps and circulating primary unit sites generally had utilized flake frequencies
between 25-46 percent; Lowden was the exception with 65.8 percent of its tool
assemblage consisting of flakes (Figure 13 and 14). The Lemens rockshelter tool
data is similar to temporary use sites (see Table 8).
Another significant difference between the sites is in projectile point frequency. Projectile points are rather scarce in possible temporary sites, generally
representing less than 15 percent of the flaked tool assemblage; Bear Creek is an
exception with a projectile point frequency of 24.7 percent. Sites suggested to be
base camps had projectile point frequencies averaging about 31 percent, With
Lowden and Indian Springs having much lower percentages (see Table 8).
Circulating sites from Hog Creek fell between these two groups, with projectile
point frequencies of about 26 percent of the overall assemblage. Significantly,
Lemens had a projectile point frequency of 11.99 percent.
The third tool category that is notably different between these site groups is
the scraper. Temporary sites have scraper frequencies of 0.83 percent; Bear
Creek is the exception with 2.05 percent scrapers in its tool assemblage (see
Table 8). Sites suggested to be base camps, on the other hand, had scraper
frequencies ranging between 0.95-9.77 percent. Circulating primary unit sites
have frequencies ranging from 1.23 percent at Windy Shelter to 2.91 percent at

Smith ~ Lemens Rockshelter

245

Stone Shelter (see Figure 14). Scraping tools at Lemens accounted for only 0.6
percent of the tools.
The frequency of bifaces does not clearly correlate with the site type groupings, although circulating sites generally have a higher percentage of bifaces
(and biface thinning flakes) than either temporary or base camps. The frequency
of bifaces may not be an accurate indication of either the temporary or more
permanent nature of sites, but more closely reflects an expedient activity that
was important at specific sites. Only 3.7 percent of the tools at Lemens were
bifaces.
Table 9 depicts pottery frequencies, as well as the ratio of cores to debitage
and groundstone to chipped stone tools from rockshelter assemblages. The presence of pottery, and the higher numbers of grinding implements, is a nbticeable
difference between Late Prehistoric base camps and temporary sites. Of the
possible temporary use sites, only Bear Creek had pottery sherds. All five Of

the suggested rockshelter base camps had pottery sherds in some quantity. Possible base camps also have groundstone:lithic tool ratios of 1:82 or less. The
temporary sites, however, have very high groundstone:lithic tool ratios, while
the circulating primary unit sites have intermediate ratios ranging between 1:27
and 1:136. At Lemens, the groundstone:lithic tool ratio is 1:642 (see Table 9).

Use of Rockshelters
Several rockshelter sites have been excavated within 50 miles of Lemens
that contain Toyah and Austin phase cultural materials. Comparisons of the
recovered materials from these sites may also provide a better contextual understanding of the nature of the occupations at the Lemens rockshelter.
In the Lake Whitney area, Jelks (1953:189-207, 1962) reported on excavations at the Blum and Kyle rockshelters. Stephenson (1970) reported on the
Sheep, Pictograph, and Buzzard shelters at the same reservoir.
Pictograph Shelter had a living area of approximately 100 m2. Fourteen
hearths, 3 slab-lined cists, 2 burials, wall pictographs, corn cobs, and perishable
materials were documented in the excavations. In addition to lithic tools and
debris, pottery, grinding implements, and a large quantity of bone tools were
recovered. Due to the wide range of features and activities represented at the
site, I suggest that Pictograph Shelter was occupied as a semi-permanent base
camp.
Kyle had a living area of approximately 330 m2. Numerous features (17
hearths, 1 firepit, 2 mat/wood features, and 3 burials), perishable materials, and
11 painted pebbles were recovered in the excavations (Jelks 1962). The Blum
Rockshelter had a living area of approximately 150 m2. Jelks (1953) reported
numerous ash lenses, piles of fire-cracked limestone rocks, masses of charcoal,
and concentrations of snails and mussel shell; no formal hearths were identified. Sheep Shelter deposits had 3 hearths, 2 slab-lined cists, and 5 burials in
the 450 m2 living area. Buzzard Shelter, with a living area of approximately 275
m2, had four features: 3 hearths and 1 work area. The artifacts from each of these
four sites are similar to the asssemblage from Pictograph Shelter, and they are
also thought to represent semi-permanent base camps.
Other than burials, the Hog Creek shelter deposits contained no obvious
features other than burned areas with charcoal and ash (from Five Goat, Windy,
and L. E. Robertson shelters) (Henry et al. 1980). These shelters were also small
compared to those discussed from Lake Whitney, with areas of occupation
ranging from 32-225 m2 (mean = 133 m2, sd = 94 m2), with Windy Shelter the
largest occupied shelter.
The noticeable absence of pottery in the Lemens site assemblage (see Table
9) may be the result of either a short occupation during Toyah times, or perhaps
it is due to the lack of contact and trade with the ceramic-producing Caddoan
groups of East Texas. Also of interest is the presence of fishhooks or fishhook
blanks in several of these sites. Forrester (1985) reports the presence of a

Smith ~ Lemens Rockshelter

247

fishhook at the Horn Shelter. Other than Lemens, these sites are all on or near
the Brazos River.

Age of the Deposit
Prewitt (1985:Table 1) lists uncorrected radiocarbon dates for the Austin
and Toyah phases. The range of dates for the Toyah Phase falls between A.D.
1180 + 100 and A.D. 1560 + 130. For the Austin Phase--the major occupation
period for the Lemens site--the dates fall between A.D. 560 + 150 and A.D.
1000 +_ 50. Prewitt (1985:227) illustrates a southward progression in the dates of
both the Austin and Toyah phases with the Austin Phase shifting to the south as
the Toyah Phase encroaches in the north.
The last part of the Archaic period is the Driftwood phase. Prewitt (1981:82)
reports relevant dates of A.D. 570 _+ 100 to A.D. 610 + 60 from the Bear Creek
Shelter. These dates overlap the beginning dates for the Austin Phase of the Late
Prehistoric period. No diagnostic cultural material from this phase was found at
Lemens, although the Godley and Ellis points found in the shelter may represent
a Transitional Archaic period occupation that corresponds in time to the Driftwood Phase. These points are often found associated with Darl points, the
diagnostic points for the Driftwood Phase (Forrester 1964:Figure 6; Stephenson
1970:136).

Burial Treatment
Of the 20 burials found in the above rockshelter sites, seven or possibly
eight of them date to the Austin Phase. Two others dates to the Toyah Phase, and
the others may be both Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric in age. None of these
burials were covered by rock cairns.
At Kyle, one of the burials was a Toyah phase cremation wrapped in a mat
and possibly covered with a single limestone slab. One semi-flexed adult and one
flexed child burial were found in an Austin phase context. The adult was covered
with burned rock, but no mention was made of a rock covering on the child; no
grave goods were associated with any of the burials.
One infant burial at Little Buzzard Shelter had an associated bone awl, and a
child burial had Scallorn and Fresno points (Long 1961). Sheep Shelter had five
burials with six individuals. One semi-flexed adolescent burial probably dated to
the Toyah phase. The four remaining burials (flexed and semi-flexed) were from
an Austin phase context, and included one adult, two child, and one adult!
adolescent burials. They had no grave goods.
Two burials were recovered in a mixed Austin-Toyah phase stratum at
Pictograph Shelter. One flexed child was buried in the pit of a hearth and covered
with the surrounding matrix while the other burial was scattered; none had any
grave goods.

248

Texas Archeological Society

The Bear Creek Shelter (Lynott 1978) excavations reported one Late Archaic burial. It had no grave goods or associated stone covering.
One Austin phase burial was found at the Greenwade Shelter, also on Lake
Whitney. No stones were used for covering, but an atlatl hook may have been
associated with the burial (Stephenson 1970:263-264).
In the Hog Creek Valley, three burials, containing six individuals, were
interred in a similar manner to those at Lemens. All, however, date to the Late
Archaic period. The L. E. Robertson Shelter had a single adult burial covered
with limestone slabs, and a chert core was resting on the rib cage. Five Goat
Shelter had three burials, although only one was professionally excavated. It was
a secondary burial Of an adult that was covered with a cairn of limestone slabs.
Bones from at least four individuals were recovered in a multiple secondary
burial in the Stone Rockshelter. The bodies were placed against a natural shelf
and covered with pieces of limestone; no artifacts were found in association with
the burial.
Forrester (n.d.) also reports four burials from the Horn Shelter, one of
which was an 18 month old infant placed in a box-like crypt of rocks open at
the west end. The burial dates to the Toyah zone at the shelter and had a shell
animal effigy pendant as a burial offering. A Late Archaic adult burial in the
shelter was covered with two limestone slabs, and had no offerings. The third
and fourth burials were infants; the latter, a Late Archaic burial, had a bone awl
as a possible association ....
Immediately to the west of the Lemens Rockshelter, an infant burial at the
Trinque site had been covered with limestone slabs (Cloud and Smith 1993). No
artifacts were associated with the burial; however, its stratigraphic position
suggests that it dates from the end of the Late Archaic period to the beginning of
the Late Prehistoric period (Cloud and Smith 1993:316).
This summary suggests that covering burials with limestone cairns or slabs
is most common in Late Archaic to Toyah phase burials to the south of Lemens.
From the burials closest to Lemens in the Lake Whitney area, only those at the
Kyle site had any type of stone coverings and those were not described as
massive as the cairns from Lemens.
Turning to sites to the west, in the Abilene area, there are prehistoric
mortuary practices reported that are similar to the burial treatment at Lemens.
Little work has been done in the Abilene area since Cyrus Ray published his
findings during the 1930s and t940s in the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological
and Paleontological Society. Of the 65 burials or so reported to have been
excavated by Ray, 50 were placed in slab-lined, box-like structures. Ray
(1939:226) states that he had found stone slab cist mounds 175 miles east to west
and 60 miles south to north centering on Abilene.
Ray (1931:76) describes such stone graves as oval or circular structures
with an enclosure of vertically set flat stones with the center filled with flat rocks.
The burial rested under one of the flat rocks, forming a box-like, stone lined cist.
These stone cists were not simply rock cairns. Others excavated by Ray

Smith ~ Lemens Rockshelter

249

included eight burials covered by rocks, but the rocks did not include vertical
slabs forming a cist. Such burial treatment is similar to the adult burial at
Lemens. Other burials are reported in the Abilene area that had no associated
stones.
Little evidence was recorded about the time period of the burials that can
be used today. Cyrus Ray was more interested in the antiquity of the skeletons
than in the artifact assemblages associated with them. He believed changes in
morphological shape represented evidence for evolutionary change;
consequently, most of his articles on Abilene area burials simply described the
skeletons, with little space or illustrations devoted to detailed descriptions of
the artifacts or their context.
Ray (1933:Plate 8, 1936:Plate 1, and 1939:Plate 5) illustrates projectile
points found associated with three stone cist burials he identifies as part of a
"Sand Dune Culture." The illustrated points include Perdiz, Scallorn, Fresno, and
Garza types, as well as the Moran type. The Moran type, defined by R.E.
Forrester (1987:131-136), dates in part to the Austin Phase since it is found in
association with the Scallorn point in two burials. At least three other stone cist
burials are reported by Ray to have contained serrated points similar to the
Moran or Scallorn types. Ray (1929:12) also states that the "Sand Dune Culture"
is a pre-pottery complex. The occurrence of Scallorn arrowpoints in these burials
suggests then that they may have been contemporaneous with at least a part of
the Austin Phase.
It is worthwhile to examine the grave offerings associated with the burials
from this area. Of the nine burials reported by Ray to have had grave goods, only
two contained large quantities of such items. The majority of the burials contained isolated offerings of awls, beads, or more commonly, complete freshwater
mussel shells. Projectile points were sometimes associated with burials, but they
may not have been intended as offerings since the descriptions given by Ray
were not always clear on matters of context,
The first of the two major grave offerings reported by Ray (1933:14-17)
was found at the Hollis Roberts Mound Complex (Mound 1) on the Clear Fork of
the Brazos River in Jones County. The burial consisted of a woman and a child
that were found in a typical stone slab structure. With these two individuals was a
tool kit very similar to that recovered from the Lemens adult burial. It consisted
of 15 items, including five large mussel shells, three antler tine flakers, three deer
ulna flakers, one bone awl, one used quartzite stone, one crude side scraper, and
one thin unidentified chert projectile point.
A total of 19 burials were reported by Ray (1937:194) from the four rock
mounds on the Roberts property. Each was enclosed in a separate slab-lined cist.
At least three other burials from the site were reported to have had isolated grave
offerings.
The second major concentration of grave goods reported by Ray (1936:916) was found on the E.W. Douthit ranch in Mitchell County. The burial was a
child cremation. It was discovered under a rock cairn of tightly wedged large flat

250

Texas Archeological Society

rocks. Ray (1936:11) notes that the cremation was placed in a circular hole (three
feet in diameter) that had been cut one foot into the underlying bedrock. The
grave goods (Ray 1937:Plate 1) consisted of a large gray stone pendant, a small
shell pendant, one stone gorget, one stone ring, two half-moon shaped serrated
stones (lunate stones?), four oval stone pendants, several polished bird bone
beads, a great number of polished quartz pebbles (suggested to be rattlestones),
and three unidentified projectile points. The points were described as larger than
arrowpoints, and thus may have been Late Archaic forms.
Forrester (1951:132-143) describes a cemetery site in Shackelford County
that contained one burial marked by vertical flat slabs similar to those described
by Ray. This burial (Forrester 1951:138) contained five associated items: two
complete freshwater mussel shells, two deer ulna tools, and a snake skeleton
without the skull. In a second burial at that site, Forrester (1951:137-138 and
Figure 5) notes a grave offering of seven items bundled in a compact mass. In the
mass were one antler tine, three deer split radii, one unfinished awl, one polished
deer radius awl, and one deer ulna flaker. A broken Moran projectile point was
also found associated with the burial.
Hughes (1942:48) reports one flexed burial placed in a stone box-like structure at the Harrell site: The structure consisted of upright stones on three sides
with a layer of stones on the top. This burial was one of 32 individuals found in
the siteâs cemetery. Some of these burials had Scallorn points associated with
them in ways that would indicate they were the cause of death. Overall, very
few burial offerings were placed with the burials, and these include isolated
mussel shells, bone beads, chert tools, and a bone hairpin.

SUMMARY
The Lemens shelter was probably occuPied on a short-term basis as a campsite. The size of the shelter and the distance from a major water source would
support this suggestion. The large cairn in the southern part of the shelter would
have further reduced the usable interior space. No intact hearth areas were found
in the shelter that would indicate a more sustained use of the site. The large
shelter complex at the nearby Panther Cave (41SV105) may have been the base
camp location.
The number of projectile points and spall scrapers in the artifact assemblage suggests that the principal activity was the working of wood (utilizing
flakes and notches) for such items as bows and arrow shafts; rehafting of shafts
also likely occurred. Lithic procurement or bifacial tool production were minor
activities at Lemens. Taken together, all these activities in turn suggest that the
shelter may have been used mainly as a temporary hunting camp.
The primary occupation of the Lemens shelter occurred during the Austin
Phase-- sometime between ca. A.D. 600 and A.D. 1050. Material evidence from

Smith ~ Lemens Rockshelter

251

the site also indicates that it was utilized during the Toyah Phase; this phase
probably ended ca. A.D. 1400 A.D. in the area. Whether the shelter was utilized prior to the Austin Phase is uncertain.
While it is common to find burials covered with rock cairns throughout
the western part of Texas, the specific method of cairn burial at Lemens is not
common. Considerable manpower was required to bring the rocks to the shelter, while other burials in this area do not have massive rock coverings nor a
large amount of offerings. The care taken by constructing a cist to protect the
infant remains from being crushed is much the same as burial treatments found
to the west in the Abilene area. Grave offerings of a similar nature are also seen
in some of these same area burials. It is unknown whether the grave offerings
for the Lemens adult burial indicate that this individual was a person of stature.
Future investigations at sites such as Lemens should add to the Corpus of information known about the Austin Phase.

APPENDIX A
A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF SKELETAL MATERIAL
FROM LEMENS ROCKSHELTER,
SOMERVELL COUNTY, TEXAS

Patricia M. Landau and Gail A. Colby

The analyzed material from Lemens Rockshelter consisted of two individuals: an adult male 35-45 years of age, and a subadult 3-5 years of age but of
indeterminate sex. Although preservation of the recovered skeletal material is
relatively good, some of the bones are broken and fragmentary, and evidence of
rodent gnawing is noted, particularly on the long bones and the clavicles of the
adult.
Parts of each individual are represented by only a few elements (a complete inventory of identified elements is on file at the Department of Anthropology, Texas A&M University). For example, much of the subadult material was
not preserved; the vertebral column and most of the cranium is represented only
by fragments. The viscerocranium of the adult was very fragmentary and fragile; due to the substantial deterioration that occurred in this area prior to excavation, most of the facial region is represented only by fragmentary bone.

252

GENDER, AGE, AND STATURE ASSESSMENT
Adult male

The adult is determined to be male by the inverted triangular shape of the
pubic body and the contribution of the greater sciatic notch (Steele and Bramblett
1988). Using the McKern and Stewart (1957) and Suchey et al. (1988) methods,
the adult male individual was determined to be 35 to 45 years old at death. Since
none of the femora or tibiae are complete, the stature of the adult was determined
by using measurements of segments of the left femur to estimate the length of the
complete femur (Steele 1970). In turn, the estimated length of the complete
femur was used to estimate the adult stature of the individual (Steele and
Bramblett 1988, after Trotter 1970). The estimated stature of this individual is
160.3-172.49 cm.

Subadult
The age of the subadult was determined to be 3 to 5 years old from the state
of its dental development and eruption (Ubelaker 1978). It was not possible to
determine the gender or the stature of the subadult individual.

DISORDERS
Adult Male
Some elements of each hand of the adult are present, although neither hand
is completely represented by all skeletal elements. No obvious difference exists
between the minimum circumference of the diaphyses of the left and right
humerii, radii, and ulnae that might indicate the preferential use of one hand or
the other. However, the deltoid tuberosity of the right humerus is more marked
than that of the left; while this may indicate that the individual was right handed,
it certainly demonstrates that the right arm of the individual was probably not
impaired. There is no evidence of traumatic injury to the arms or hands. Additionally, carpals from both left and right hands were recovered, indicating that
this individual did not suffer premortem loss of either hand.
Arthritic lipping on the right side of the superior surface of the first sacral
body is marked, and the median sacral crest exhibits a slight curvature to the
fight. Marked arthritic growth in the lumbar region of the vertebral column is
consistent with normal degenerative changes.
The right iliac fossa exhibits hyperplastic bone growth that may be the
result of the evulsion of the iliacus muscle, which originates in this region.
Additional bone growth along the right pectineal line is also probably associated
with this injury.

Smith ~ Lemens Rockshelter

253

Indications of a periosteal infection are present on one intermediate phalange and the right clavicle of the individual.
Moderate wear is present on all of the mandibular molars. There is evidence
of moderate periodontal disease on the mandible; additionally, small fenestrae
are present in the alveoli for RML LI~, and LI2. There is no evidence of caries on
the mandibular dentition. The maxilla also exhibits evidence of periodontal
disease, and wear is slightly more pronounced. A carie and a fenestra are visible
in the alveolus of LM~. A large carie is present on the RM~ and the adjacent RM2;
a very large abscess can be observed in the vicinity of these teeth in the right
maxilla.

Subadult
No evidence of any disorders were present on the subadult.
