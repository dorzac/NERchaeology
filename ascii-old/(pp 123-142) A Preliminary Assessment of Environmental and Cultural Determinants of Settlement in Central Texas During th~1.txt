A Preliminary Assessment of Environmental
and Cultural Determinants of Settlement in
Central Texas During the Nineteenth Century
Shawn Bonath Carlson

ABSTRACT
An archeological survey was conducted for the Department of the Army
at Fort Hood in Central Texas during the winter of 1982-1983 by the Texas
Areheological Survey at The University of Texas at Austin. The results of the
survey were later analyzed by the Archeological Research Laboratory at
Texas A&M University. Of the nearly 200 sites recorded, 88 were historic.
This paper strives to identify possible trends in historic settlement through the
use of basic environmental data observed and recorded in the field. Combined
with historical documentation pertaining to the project area and chronological
data obtained from the recovered artifacts, suggestions are made concerning
preferred site locations and periods of settlement.

INTRODUCTION
Eighty-eight historic sites were recorded during a 35 km2 survey at the Fort
Hood Military Installation in Central Texas and are summarized here for the
purpose of identifying possible trends in historic settlement (Figure 1). Environmental and cultural determinants are examined and regular patterns of settlement
found in regard to zone of settlement, landform, vegetation, distance to water,
beginning date of settlement, length of settlement, ethnicity, and occupations.
Environmental data and historical documentation are particularly stressed at Fort
Hood because of impacts to the cultural remains by military activities that have
destroyed their contextual integrity. Initial impacts occurred at the time of acquisition in the 1940s when all domestic structures were razed or moved to nearby
Killeen. Since then, tracked and wheeled vehicles, bulldozing, artillery fire,
ordnance, and bivouac operations have caused daily impacts to the sites. In spite of
these weaknesses, the United States military installation at Fort Hood offers a
unique opportunity to examine historic site settlement in a contiguous area covering approximately 546 km2 (339 square miles).
The survey was conducted for the army during the winter of 1982-1983 by the
Texas Archeological Survey (TAS) at the University of Texas at Austin under
contract to Science Applications, Inc., of LaJolla, California. The results of the
survey were analyzed for the army during the summer of 1983 by the Archeological Research Laboratory (ARL) at Texas A&M University under contract to SCubed, also of LaJolla, California.

BACKGROUND

Fort Hood, one of the largest military installations in the world, is located in
Bell and Coryell counties in Central Texas. The sites discussed here are in Coryell
County in the northern part of the fort (Figure 1). Characterized by varying relief
within the Lampasas Cut Plains, Fort Hood lies adjacent to Texas’s major physiographic feature, the Balcones Escarpment (Arbingast et al. 1976:8,12,13). It also
lies near thej uncture of three physiographic regions: the Edwards Plateau, the Cross
Timbers, and the Blackland Prairies (Figure 2).
The cultural history of Coryell County does not begin until after the establishment of Fort Gates in 1849 (Scott 1965). As one of a series of forts established by
the War Department to protect the frontiersmen from marauding Indians, it was
located beyond the fringes of westernmost settlement in Texas. Within two years,

settlement had advanced to this permanent line of defense, and Fort Gates was
abandoned. During the early years of settlement, the problem of straying livestock
was complicated by the threat of Indian theft. The Assistant Marshall stated in the
population schedules of Coryell County in 1860 that"the dwellings in the southwest
portion of this county are unoccupied, the inhabitants were forced to abandon for
the purpose of self preservation from Indian depredations" (United States Bureau
of the Census 1860a).
Indian dissension continued for many years, and it was not until the 1880s that
settlement intensified and the development of Coryell County really began. Industrial manufacturing was never significant, and farrning and stock raising were the
critical industries. The interpretation of historic sites at Fort Hood presupposes
knowledge of these industries, which dominate the archeological record.

conducted.

A literature search for previously known historic sites in the Fort Hood vicinity
was conducted for a 13-county area extending from the Colorado River to the
Brazos River and slightly north and south of the project area (Figure 3). The counties
chosen encompass the Fort Hood area and lie within the Central Texas Prairies
(Richardson et al. 1981). The search was admittedly limited to current indices of
Texas archeology (Simons 1981, 1983), but it does acknowledge most of the major
historic sites that have been previously recorded for the area. With the exception of
recent studies at Fort Hood (D. Carlson et al. 1980; S. Carlson 1984; Dibble et al.
1984a, 1984b; Guderjan et al. 1980; Jackson 1982; Jackson et al. 1982a, 1982b;
Prewitt et al. 1983; Roemer et al. 1985; Skinner et al. 1981, 1984), no reports of
investigations could be found for eight of the thirteen counties (Bell, Bosque,
Bumet, Coryell, Falls, Hamilton, Lampasas, and Mills), including the counties that
encompass Fort Hood. For the remaining counties (Hill, McLennan, Milam, Travis,
and Williamson), most of the studies were outdated descriptive survey reports.

The high number of historic sites recorded at the Fort Hood Military Installation, which to date number more than 800, suggests the need for pattern recognition.
Though the project area discussed in this paper does not cover a contiguous area,
subsequent surveys have been completed recently for more than 200 contiguous
square kilometers and shouldprovide more reliable data (D. Carlson et al. 1986; S.
Carlson, Ensor, et al. 1987; S. Carlson, D. Carlson, et al. 1987). These Central Texas
sites represent a unique "time capsule." Most were settled during the latter part of
the nineteenth century (ca. 1880) and were purchased by the army beginning in
1942. It is likely that many of these sites represent continuous occupations. As a
group, they are similar to many other settlements throughout Texas during the
nineteenth century and may reflect adaptations peculiar to later settlers of the
western frontier.
RESEARCH DESIGN

The investigations at Fort Hood required only inventory and assessment of the
cultural resources, since the sites were not being threatened immediately. Research
objectives were developed using only the basic information necessary for inventory
and assessment and primarily included locational, documentary, and chronological
data. Those objectives focused upon the following six expectations:
(1) It was expected that fewer sites would be found per square kilometer in
either the uplands or flood plain areas than in the intermediate zone.
(2) The early settlers were expected to favor easily accessible drinking water
from streams, cisterns, or wells.
(3) It was expected that a relationship would be found between site complexity and site function.
(4) The distributions of sites by landform were expected to be an indicator of
site function.
(5) It was expected that the increased manufacturing and production of goods
during the late nineteenth century would be reflected by a higher deposition of
artifacts during that period.
(6) It was expected that the increased manufacturing and production of the late
nineteenth century would be reflected by increased size of activity areas.
The locational data were recorded in the field and ranged from grid coordinates
and site size to a variety of environmental data such as elevation, slope, landform,
vegetation, and distance to water. These data were coded for computer analysis and
provided a variety of answers regarding preferences of the early pioneers for
settlement of the project area.
The research questions also assumed the availability and use of a limited
number of primary documents, which included (1) title abstracts, (2) population,
agricultural, and industrial manuscript census schedules, and (3) General Land
Office records. These documents generally provided information on land ownership, length of land use, use of the land through time, population density, ethnicity,
etc. Although many other documents could have been consulted, these records
provided a wide variety of information that could be examined quickly and used in

128

the assessment of site significance.
Research questions addressing the chronological data were difficult to construct, due to the limited number of diagnostic cultural remains. Because of the
minimal collection policies established by the Fort Hood archeologist, many
historic artifacts have been recorded simply as being present or absent. Only a
representative sample of those believed to be diagnostic was collected. Usually this
included decorated ceramics, bottle lips and bases, the characteristic lavender glass,
and any items with trademarks or patent numbers. However, the frequently
occurring undecorated whitewares may be useful eventually as diagnostic markers
for the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century (Lebo and Marcaurelle
1983). Because the chronological data were so limited at Fort Hood, the date ranges
presented here represent the range of manufacture for the artifacts observed or
collected at each site and not the occupational range of the site. However, the range
of manufacture is currently our best estimate for when sites may have been occupied
and should overlap the range of occupation.
ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF SETTLEMENT

Three broad environmental zones have been identified by the Fort Hood archeologist: (1) the lowlands, which include bottomland associated with perennial and
intermittent streams, (2) the intermediate uplands, which encompass land higher
than the lowland zone but do not include the massive limestone found in parts of Fort
Hood, and (3) the uplands, which encompass only the areas where limestone is
exposed (Briuer 1983; Roemer et al. 1985:III-1, 2). The 88 historic sites were primarily in the lowland and intermediate uplands (Figure 4). More than half of these
occurred in the intermediate uplands and were defined as domestic dwellings, farm/
ranch complexes, and trash dumps. Slightly fewer sites of similar functions occurred in the lowlands. The fewest sites occurred in the uplands, and most were trash
dumps.
More than half of the sites were distributed between 244 and 251 meters (800
and 825 feet) above mean sea level (AMSL), with the range of elevations extending
from 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) AMSL. However, previous studies using
statistical methods have suggested that there are no preferred site locations for
historic sites at Fort Hood based on either elevation or environmental zone (Carlson
et al. 1983). The chronological distribution of the 88 historic sites by elevation,
however, appears to suggest some regularities (Figure 5). Using the range of
beginning dates of manufacture for artifacts recovered, a preliminary range of
occupation was established. Sites located between 244 and 274 meters (800 and 900
feet) AMSL tended to be both the earliest settled and the longest occupied. A
distribution based on the average range of beginning and ending dates of manufacture suggested other regularities as well. The lowland sites seemed to be somewhat
earlier and were also abandoned earlier. The remaining sites were probably
occupied until the time of purchase by the army beginning in 1942.
Similar analyses of the site distribution of landforms have suggested that
slopes, secondary terraces, and knolls were preferred site locations, with

to be the preferred locations for farm/ranch complexes characterized by multiple
structmes, while secondary terraces, knolls, and interfluvials were the most frequent choices for domestic dwellings (Figure 7). Trash dumps corresponded with

secondary terraces, slopes, and interfluvials but did not seem to be associated with
individual dwellings or farm/ranch complexes. On the whole, all historic sites in the
study area favored prominent locations.
The vegetation recorded at these sites had little diversity (Figure 8). Most sites
were in open grassland, and the remainder were in mixed forests. The nearest water
was generally available from on-site concrete-ringed wells and cisterns or nearby
streams. More than half were within 150 meters, though none was more than 330
meters distant (Figure 9). The distance to these water sources from the main site
areas generally increased after 1880. The availability of permanent water also
appeared to have no bearing on the choice of site location (Figure 10). All sites in

the study area were between 15 and 75 km from a major drainage, suggesting that
nearness to water was not a critical factor. The poor navigability of many Texas
rivers may also have detracted from settlement near permanent water (Puryear and
Winfield 1976:xvi). Overland routes to the Brazos River, about 80 to 113 km (50
to 75 miles) to the east, may have been used more frequently than the locally unreliable waterways (Puryear and Winfield 1976:4). Lastly, a chronological plot of the
site locations along each of the major drainages revealed that initial settlement
occurred in waves at periodic intervals (Figure 11), each successive wave filling in
the gaps remaining from the previous influxes. The resulting pattern is chronologically mixed, probably reflecting the partitioning of the original land grants through
time.
CULTURAL DETERMINANTS OF INITIAL SETTLEMENT

The cultural determinants for initial site setdement in the study area were
identified from documentary data concerning the original land grants, ethnicity of
the original settlers, and the local industries.
Nine types of land grants were issued in the study area (Table 1). Of the original
46 grantees, only 13 had been issued title to their land by 1860 (Texas General Land

Office 1941). These grants included first-, second-, and third-class headrights,
military bounties, and battle donations. Many of these were given for military
service, either during the 1836 fight for independence or on the frontier afterwards.
The first-, second-, and third-class grants issued in the study area before 1860
largely indicate settlement in Texas before 1840. The first-class grants were
intended to reward those who assisted during the war for independence. The second-

136

Texas Archeological Society

and third-class grants were issued to encourage settlement in Texas (Miller
1967:151,739).
Titles issued after 1860 in the project area were for preemption, school, and
Confederate scrip certificates. The greatest number of settlers in the project area
acquired their land by preemption; that is, they settled vacant lands in the public
domain and were given first choice at purchase of those lands (Miller 1972:35).
School certificates were issued for lands set aside by the Texas congress in
1840, the proceeds of which were invested in Texas or United States bonds (Miller
1972:110). Confederate scrip certificates were issued to permanently disabled
veterans or to widows (Miller 1972:52-53).
The variety oflandgrants available and the criteria for eligibility were designed
to encourage settlement on the Texas frontier. Many of the earliest settlers, before
statehood, were required to swear allegiance to Mexico and adherence to the
Catholic faith (Miller 1972:16, 22). Some came to escape the law and others to
continue the southern practice of slavery (Miller 1972:21). The influence of these
grants upon settlement was significant. In particular, they caused settlement to
occur earlier and faster, and they influenced large waves of Europeans to settle in
Texas. Finally, they attracted a certain breed of settler who was willing to accept the
conditions of settlement in order to obtain free or inexpensive land.
The original settlers in Coryell County, which encompasses part of Fort Hood,
were largely Texas born (33 percent), while the greatest migrations came from
Tennessee (16 percent), Arkansas (7 percent), Alabama (7 percent), Missouri (6
percent), Georgia (4.5 percent), and Mississippi (4.5 percent) (United States Bureau
of the Census 1860b). Similarly, the leading states of birth for the surrounding
counties in 1860 were Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee (Jordan 1970:413).
Recent studies by Jordan (1970:426) have successfully demonstrated the similarities of the hilly area, in which all of Fort Hood is included, to the Ozarks and
Appalachians. These similarities are attributed to transplantation of economy and
culture. In particular, they are similar in cultural landscape, educational levels, place
names, feuding, and the use of log structures. Economically, their underdevelopment, lack of urbanization and industrialization, and dependence on stock raising
are comparable. Jordan (1970:427) suggests that "the migration of these people to
the hills of central Texas was in part guided by their perception of the environment,
by their desire to find another milieu similar to that they had left behind."
Though Coryell County was largely a stock-producing county in 1860 (Scott
1965:47), not a single person gave his occupation as stock raiser in the 1860 United
States Census. Ironically, this was in contradiction to some of the earliest land-grant
policies that conveyed one labor (71.6 ha, 177.1 acres) of land to farmers and one
league (1720 ha,4251 acres) of farm land to ranchers (Miller 1972:17). That is, the
land policies favored those claiming to be stock raisers by granting them more
acreage than they did the farmers. Of the 596 people (male and female) over the age
of 15 who listed their occupations with the census taker in 1860, 235 were farmers
and 118 farm laborers (United States Bureau of the Census 1860b). These men
accounted for more than 59 percent of the working population. Though the third
most frequently listed occupation was herdsman (87), these were mostly young

Carlson ~ Environmental and Cultural Determinants

137

teenage boys and the sons of men who claimed to be farmers.
The county tax rolls also support stock raising as the primary industry in
Coryell County, particularly between 1860 and 1870, when the number of cattle
being raised was at its per-capita peak (Coryell County Tax Rolls 1855-1985).
During this early period, limited quantities of feed corn and wheat were the major
crops. By 1870, sheep were becoming an important commodity, replacing cattle in
importance and reaching their peak production in 1890. Hogs were also raised in
quantity, but never to the same extent as sheep and cattle. The Assistant Marshall
for Coryell County concluded the 1860 census schedule for industrial productions
by stating that the land was well adapted to stock raising due to the "mountainous"
and rocky terrain. The massive limestone was the only industrial product listed and
was used extensively in building throughout the country (United States Bureau of
the Census 1860c).
SUMMARY

The preceding discussion has summarized the historic sites data from the 19821983 survey of 35 km2 at the Fort Hood Military Installation in Central Texas. Based
primarily on the environmental data, the documentary evidence, and the archeological remains, a series of six research objectives were identified and tested for the 88
historic sites recorded. The expectations of this research are summarized here.
(1) It was expected that fewer sites would be found per square kilometer in
either the uplands or flood plain areas than in the intermediate zone, which was
believed to have the most favorable environment. Also, the most densely settled
zones were expected to be the earliest settled. However, the lowlands were found
to be the most densely settled environmental zone, probably due to the varying relief
at Fort Hood which ranges from 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) AMSL in the
project area. In addition, the lowlands were also found to be the earliest settled zone,
confirming the expectation that the earliest settled zone would also be the most
densely settled zone.
(2) The early settlers were expected to favor easily accessible drinking water
from streams, cisterns, and wells. Nearness to rivers for transport of marketable
goods would have been desirable and low flood-prone areas avoided. Also, sites
located adjacent to permanent streams and rivers were expected to be the earliest
settled. However, no sites were closer than 1500 meters to permanent water. The
nearest available water, which included cisterns and wells, was within 150 meters.
The negative results of this test suggest that the distance to permanent water had
little influence on the early settlers, who were more likely to depend on overland
travel and artificial sources of water. However, since the lowlands were the most
densely settled zone, it is likely that these sites were located above flood stage at the
interface of the lowlands with the intermediate uplands.
It was also expected that sites adjacent to water would reflect the choronology
of population movements upstream. Though the data were insufficient to support
this expectation, it appeared that higher ranked streams were settled first and that
settlement along each stream occurred at periodic intervals, with later settlement

138

resulting from the partitioning of the original land grants.
(3) It was anticipated that a relationship would be found between site complexity and site function. In particular, it was expected that farm/ranch complexes would
be larger in size, contain more structural remains, and have a wider variety of
artifacts. Not one of these assumptions held true when tested, a finding that may be
attributed to inaccurate site definitions or multiple site use. Similarly, it was
expected that domestic dwellings would contain more household items. Household
items were defined as personal, kitchen, and craft or activity items (as opposed to
hardware such as hand tools, wagon/carriage remains, and agricultural implements). This implication was supported by the archeological data when tested.
(4) The distributions of sites by landform were expected to be an indicator of
site function (Figure 11). Habitation sites were most frequently found on knolls,
secondapj terraces, slopes, and tertiary terraces, all above flood stage. Trash
disposal tended to correspond with the same natural features as the habitation areas,
but isolated incidents of trash disposal occurred on ridges, benches, and primary
terraces.
(5) It was expected that the increased manufacturing and production of goods
during the late nineteenth century would be reflected by a higher deposition of
artifacts during that period. This difference in depositional history could be used as
a distinguishing marker between early and late sites. Unfortunately, sites containing
both early and late components were not analyzed separately. However, they were
found to contain a wider variety of artifacts by virtue of their longer occupations.
(6) It was expected that the increased manufacturing and production of the late
nineteenth century would also be reflected by increased size of activity areas. The
production of new and unique materials might result in additional buildings per site
(garages, machine sheds, tool sheds, etc.). Large sites were found, instead, to result
from continuous occupation of early sites.
CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, it appears that most of the historic settlement in the northern part
of Fort Hood occurred in the lowland areas, probably at the interface with the
intermediate uplands. Because of the poor navigability of many Texas rivers and the
distance to navigable waterways, nearness to permanent water did not appear to be
a significant factor in settlement. However, the remnants of wells and cisterns
indicated that all sites had access to drinking water within 150 to 300 meters.
Prominent landforms, such as knolls and secondary terraces, were most frequently
settled as habitation sites, although isolated trash dumps occurred on benches and
ridges (Figure 7). Sites were located primarily in open grasslands and secondarily
in mixed forests. The vast quantities of land available in the public domain of Texas
and the variety of land grants issued for that land were probably the single most
important cultural factor in determining settlement in Texas.
Most of the original settlers of the project area had migrated from the Upper
South, bringing with them a variety of traits peculiar to the Ozarks and Appalachians
where they originated. In particular, stock raising was identified as the primary

industry in many of the public records examined. The predominance of historic site
locations in open grasslands further suggests that stock raising was the major
industry. It is well documented that grasslands were commonly burned by the early
settlers for pasture land, a practice that was originated by the Indians for grazing
bison (Jordan 1973:252).
The limited archeological remains did not distinguish activities peculiar to
stock raising from those peculiar to farming or other activities, but stone fences and
large tanks, apparently for stock use, were quite common. Many above-ground
features had been dismantled by the army, but were still recognizable as the
remnants of farmsteads and ranches. Ongoing investigations at Fort Hood will be
concerned primarily with determining rural land usage and the characteristics of
rural activities that can be identified from the archeologicai record.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I thank Frederick L. Briuer, Fort Hood Archeologist, for allowing information
from the Fort Hood Archeological Survey (FY82/83) to be used here. Appreciation
is also expressed to David L. Carlson, of Texas A&M University, who prepared the
computer graphics. Both Briuer and Carlson provided thoughtful and encouraging
comments for which I am grateful.
