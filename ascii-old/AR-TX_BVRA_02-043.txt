ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the proposed Stratford-Hickory Road Connection in
the city limits of Temple, Texas (Bell County) was performed by Brazos Valley Research
Associates in July 1996. The area examined is 700 feet long with a maximum
permanent easement of 200 feet. The total area is approximately 3.2 acres. William E.
Moore, SOPA was the Principal Investigator, and Michael R. Bradle performed the
duties of Project Archaeologist. This project was carried out under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 1716. The project area was investigated using the pedestrian survey
method. One previously unrecorded multi-component archaeological site (41BL1073)
was recorded. The historic component consists of a trash scatter on the steep north
slope of Canyon Creek, and the prehistoric component consists of a large area
(approximately 80 x 200 feet) containing burned rock, mussel shell, a possible quartzite
hammerstone, and flakes on the low terrace on the north side of Canyon Creek. The
prehistoric component has been vandalized as evidenced by 29 potholes. No
diagnostic artifacts were observed.
The historic component contains bottle and crockery fragments, metal cans, and
unidentified metal objects dating to the early 20th century mixed with modern trash. It is
believed that the historic artifacts were pushed over the edge of the bluff by a bulldozer,
possibly during construction of St. Francis Episcopal Church or an earlier structure. It is
not eligible for listing as a State Archeological Landmark. The prehistoric component,
although heavily disturbed, appears to contain small areas of intact deposits and is
considered eligible for listing as a State Archeological Landmark. It is recommended for
Phase II testing if avoidance of these intact areas is not possible. No artifacts were
collected from this site.

INTRODUCTION
An archaeological survey of the Stratford-Hickory Road Connection was
conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) within the city limits of
Temple, Texas in July 1996. The general location of the project area in Bell County is
depicted in Figure 1. William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator and the Project
Archaeologist was Michael R. Bradle. The City of Temple proposes to connect Stratford
and Hickory roads by constructing a new road segment that will cross Canyon Creek.
The proposed road is 700 feet long and 36 feet wide (Figure 2). The permanent
easement will vary from 150 feet in the cut areas to 200 feet where it will cross Canyon
Creek. The project area is depicted on the Belton 7.5' U.S.G.S topographic quadrangle
dated 1965 and photorevised in 1993 (Figure 3).
Because of the potential for significant archaeological sites within the project
area, a Phase I cultural resources survey was required by the Department of Antiquities
Protection, pursuant to the Texas Antiquities Code, as amended. In order to comply
with this requirement, the City of Temple contracted with BVRA to perform this service
under Texas Antiquities Permit 1716. The project number assigned by Brazos Valley
Research Associates is BVRA 96-06. The City of Temple refers to this project as the
Stratford - Hickory Road Connection, Bell County, City of Temple. There was no federal
involvement.
The research design was coordinated with the Department of Antiquities
Protection, Texas Historical Commission and the City of Temple and was designed to
intensively survey the project area in order to identify all prehistoric and historic
archeological and/or architectural properties that may be eligible for State Archeological
Landmark designation.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Bell County is located within the Balconian biotic province as defined by Blair
(1950:112-116) and includes the Gulf coastal plain from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern
Texas. The size and location of this province is described below by Blair (1950:112):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in most of the Edwards
Plateau as limited by Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1933): (Figs. 3 and
4), the Lampasas Cut Plain and Comanche Plateau of Raisz (1939 [cited
as 1946 in Blair]), and the Central Mineral or Llano Uplift region. That part
of the Edwards Plateau lying west of the Pecos, and often referred to as
the Stockton Plateau, is not included, but is referred instead to as the
Chihuahuan province.
Climate
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east to
west. Bell County is located in the eastern half of the province which has been
classified by Thornwaite (1948) as dry subhumid, mesothermal with average annual
potential evapotranspiration of between 39.27 and 44.88 inches. The annual rainfall for
Bell County is 34 inches, the January minimum temperature is 37 degrees Fahrenheit,
the July maximum temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and the growing season is
258 days (Kingston and Harris 1983).
Vegetation
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this
province is a scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oak (Quercus
texana), stunted live oak (Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the
Edwards Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Vegetational species characteristic
of the region include Plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (Quercus
texana), ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), cedar
elm (Ulmus crassifolia), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), pecan (Carya illinoinensis),
elm (Ulmus spp.), sumacs (Rhus spp.), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), agarita
(Berberis trifoliolata), Texas stillingia (Stillingia texana), yucca (Yucca spp.), Texas
prickly pear (Opuntia Lindheimeri), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and American beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana). Grasslands include seep mulhy (Muhlenbergia reverchnoii),
Canadian wildrye (Elymus canadensis), dichanthelium (Dichanthelium spp.), Texas
grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), and red grama (Bouteloua hirsuta). The project area is
now primarily overgrown with juniper and mixed oaks and grasses.

Hydrology
The project area is located within the Brazos River drainage basin, one of the
largest rivers in the state. The two streams within the project area are Pepper Creek
and Bird Creek, both tributaries to the Leon River, a tributary of the Little River.
Wildlife
The project area is located well within the Balconian Biotic Province that is
characteristically represented by a general mixture of fauna from nearby surrounding
provinces (Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include Whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), ninebanded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus),
racoon (Prycon lotor), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (Melagris
gallopavo), morning dove (Zenaida macroura), sicssor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus
forficatus), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), western coachwhip (Masticophis
flagellum testaceus), and the bullsnake (Pituophis melanoleucus sayi).

CULTURE SEQUENCE
Bell County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical region as
defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76), an area referred to as Central Texas by most
archaeologists, and rich in archaeological sites. Summaries relevant to the prehistory of
Bell County and vicinity have been prepared by various archaeologists, primarily as a
result of work at Fort Hood in Bell and Coryell counties, Texas (Guderjan et al. 1980;
Skinner et al. 1981, 1984; Thomas 1978; Roemer et al. 1985; Carlson et al. 1986),
Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site (Shafer 1963), and Stillhouse
Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964; Sorrow et al. 1967). Summaries of the region
have been published by Suhm (1960), Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Most
recently, two thorough articles concerning Central Texas were published in Volume 66
of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society. These works, entitled "Forty Years of
Archeology in Central Texas," by Michael B. Collins (1995) and "Implications of
Environmental Diversity in the Central Texas Archeological Region" by Linda Wootan
Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995), represent a major synthesis of the
vast amount of collected data for the region. The following discussion is taken primarily
from the works cited above.
Paleoindian Period
Although, according to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term
"Paleoindian," it is so widely accepted that it is used in this discussion. Paleoindian
typically refers to those cultures that were oriented toward big game hunting with food
collecting not a major pursuit. Eileen Johnson (1977:65-77) states that it has been
erroneously stereotyped as a migratory systematic big game procurement adaptation.
Collins (1995:381) argues that subsistence in Clovis times, for example, Pleoindians
exploited a diverse fauna base that not only included large herbivores such as
mammoth, bison, and horse but also included smaller animals such as water turtles,
land tortoises, alligator, mice, badger, and raccoon.
At Kincaid Rockshelter, a paved floor suggests that the inhabitants of this site
returned to the same site as part of a regular hunting and gathering strategy in contrast
with nomadic hunters who only pursued big game. It is, therefore, assumed that an
array of plants presumably also constituted part of Clovis subsistence (Collins 1990;
Collins et al. 1989).
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), this is one of the least understood time
periods in Central Texas prehistory primarily because few sites have been excavated.
As of 1985, for example, two Paleoindian sites had been reported for Bell County
(Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of this period often occurs in the form of surface
collected materials found over much of Central Texas.

7

At Fort Hood, this period is represented by distinctive projectile points found in
multicomponent surface sites and as isolated finds (Carlson et al. 1986:15). Generally,
it is believed that the Paleoindian period lasted from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000 B.C.
Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart point types Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina,
Plainview, and Angostura as defined by Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester
(1985).
These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and
may be more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan
1931). Some rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even
though they are located a considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of
a rockshelter in Central Texas immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to
contain Paleoindian occupation is the Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County
(Redder 1985).
Archaic Period
The Archaic represents a broad cultural time period that lasted from
approximately 8500 Before Present (B.P.) to 1250 B.P. in Central Texas. According to
Prewitt (1981:71), "The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas."
Prewitt (1981) has subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. LeRoy Johnson (1987)
has questioned the validity of the phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the
phases occurring before the Middle Archaic. These have been grouped into Early,
Middle, Late, and Terminal periods by Carlson et al. (1986:15). According to Prewitt
(1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a "strong orientation toward the
gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population was of low density."
This occurred during the Circleville, San Geronimo, and Jarrell phases (8500 B.P. 5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering had become very specialized as
evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock middens/mounds (Prewitt
1981:78-80). The Middle Archaic is seen by Prewitt to have taken place during the
Oakalla, Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000 B.P. - 2600 B.P.).
An overall decrease in burned rock middens took place in the Late Archaic. Bison were
important as a food resource, but did not dominate subsistence activities (Prewitt
1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases
(2600 B.P. - 1750 B.P.). The Terminal Archaic, according to the classification by
Carlson et al. (1986) includes the Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750 B.P. - 1250
B.P.). An increase in the importance of gathering and an apparent peak in site density
seem to have occurred during Prewitt's (1981:82) Driftwood phase. According to the
statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985) published by the Office of the State
Archeologist in 1985, the prehistoric site inventory for Bell County was heavily skewed
towards the Archaic. Of the 197 recorded sites, 2 were classified as Paleoindian, 10
Early Archaic, 37 Middle Archaic, 32 Late Archaic, 52 General Archaic, and 29 Late
Prehistoric. These statistics suggest that Bell County was occupied mainly during the
Archaic period which, according to Prewitt (1981:Figure 3), lasted from 8500 years B.P.
to 1250 B.P. This is supported by the statement by Collins (1995:383) that "two-thirds
of the prehistory of Central Texas is 'Archaic' in character."

8

Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been referred by some as the Neo-American Stage (Suhm et al.
1954), Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and Post-Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Technological changes are the primary distinguishing characteristics of this stage. The
Austin (1250 B.P. - 650 B.P.) and Toyah (650 B.P. - 200 B.P.) phases belong to this
stage of prehistory. During this time arrow points first appeared as well as ceramics
and possibly horticulture.
According to Collins (1995:385), there is now evidence that only the bow and
arrow appeared initially in Central Texas; pottery was added later, and agriculture
developed last and was of minor importance. Because Late Prehistoric groups
continued to practice hunting and gathering and a division or two sub-periods seem to
have taken place. These are referred to as early and late by Collins (1995:385) with the
break between the long-standing Archaic period and the Late Prehistoric period
occurring at circa 800 B.P. when Toyah replaced Austin as the prevailing archeological
manifestation.
The most obvious change that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period is the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, subsistence lifeways in the Late Prehistoric were probably little
different from those in the earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A
chronological model by Dillehay (1974) of bison presence and absence periods on the
southern plains suggests that bison were present during the Toyah phase but not during
the preceding Austin phase.
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the Historic period of Central Texas into three subperiods: early, middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and
European peoples and cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous
peoples had virtually disappeared. The early Historic sub-period in Central Texas
began in the late 17th century with the first documented arrival of Europeans. Bell
County is situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the
area in the 16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th Century they had broken ties
with the Comanche and Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apaches (Aten
1983:32). They have been described as typical southern Plains Indians who were
hunters and gatherers and who lived along the streams and rivers of Central Texas.
Remains of this group have not been found in an historic context.
During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous aboriginal groups including
the Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986). Trade
is known to have existed between the Jumanos and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches
and subsequently the Comanches entered the region from the Plains while following
key animal resources as they migrated into Texas.

9

Contact period occupations are often identified by the occurrence of glass beads,
gun parts, gunflints, metal projectile points, and European manufactured ceramics. The
archival search did not locate any Historic Indian sites in Bell County; however,
avocational archaeologist Bob Burleson (1995:6) reports finding a metal arrow point cut
from a barrel strap in fresh gravels placed on the road to his farm. In adjacent Coryell
County a blue glass bead was found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial
along the Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an
isolated find on Horse Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell
1952).
Historically, Bell County was first settled in 1834 and 1835 by colonists who
settled along Little River. The area was abandoned during the "Runaway Scrape" of
1836, reoccupied, and deserted again after the fall of Fort Parker in June 1836. The
early settlements were constantly harassed by hostile Indians and, although several
forts were established, by 1838 all settlers had left the county. On May 26, 1839, the
Indians suffered a decisive defeat at what is referred to as the "Bird's Creek Indian
Fight" about one and a half miles northwest of the present site of Temple, Texas.
However, settlement did not return to the Bell County area until after 1843. Bell County
was created on January 22, 1850 and was named for Peter H. Bell. Nolan Springs was
chosen as the county seat and named Nolanville, but on December 16, 1851 the name
was changed to Belton.
Early settlement was along the creeks and rivers, but by 1860 most of the land
had been taken. The last serious Indian raid occurred in 1859. With the Indian problem
apparently resolved, settlement increased and the county grew from 4799 in 1860, to
9771 in 1870, and to 20,518 in 1880. The number of farms in the county increased from
640 in 1869, to 2231 in 1871, and to 4249 in 1889. Bell County is chiefly an agricultural
region with cotton and corn the leading crops. The construction of Fort Hood led to a
population increase in the county from 44,863 in 1940 to 74,145 in 1950.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
According to Prehistoric Archeological Sites in Texas: A Statistical Overview
(Biesaart et al. 1985:111), there were 197 sites recorded at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in 1985 when this study was published by the Office of the
State Archeologist. At this time, Bell County was third in the North Central Texas
region, and the 197 sites represented 7.35% of the region and .97% of the state. The
archaeological significance of this area is further indicated by the fact that 61 of the 197
sites recorded in 1985 were registered as State Archeological Landmarks. This figure
represents 30.96% of all sites in Bell County.
Since 1985, however, the number of recorded sites has increased by 500.43%
from 197 to 1069 as of August 5, 1996. Although sites have been recorded by private
contract archaeology firms, avocational archaeologists, local archaeological societies,
and interested individuals, this increase in the number of sites in the county is mainly
due to large-scale federal projects such as Lake Belton, Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir,
and Fort Hood. *
The efforts of avocational archaeologists, particularly members of the Central
Texas Archaeological Society and Bell County Archeological Society, have made
notable contributions. These include articles in the form of bulletins, newsletters,
special reports, and unpublished manuscripts on file at TARL or with society members.
Bell County has been the subject of intensive investigations by members of the Central
Texas Archeological Society. As a result of the above-mentioned investigations, "Bell
County is one of the better known Central Texas counties and has provided significant
information toward the understanding of prehistoric chronologies in this part of Texas"
(Young 1987:9). In the site files at TARL are numerous pieces of correspondence from
landowners and artifact collectors documenting and describing sites and artifacts found
in Bell County. Also present, are copies of unpublished manuscripts, some of which do
not provide information concerning author and date of preparation.
Information regarding previous work in other parts of Bell County appear in the
various references cited above, especially the Fort Hood series. Only those activities in
the immediate vicinity of the project area are discussed below.
At the time of this survey there were no previously recorded archaeological sites
in the project area; however, at least 13 sites have been recorded to the west of the
project area along Bird Creek and Pepper Creek and in the broad floodplain between
Pepper Creek, Bird Creek, and the Leon River.
*A bibliography of Fort Hood reports appears as Appendix I.

11

The first of this group of sites (41BL122 - 41BL126) was recorded by Bob
Burleson. He assigned temporary numbers (PC1 - PC5) to the five sites; however, the
official TARL numbers do not follow this sequence (e.g., PC1 = 41BL124; PC2 =
41BL125; PC3 = 41BL126; PC4 = 41BL123; and PC5 = 41BL122). Mr. Burleson makes
no reference on the site form as to when and how often he visited the sites, but the site
form is dated 1966. The five sites were found on both sides of Pepper Creek, and are
between 2000 and 2500 meters west of the project area easement. The data for all five
sites are on a single page site form with an attached page of artifact descriptions and
sketch map. According to the site form, the sentence in the "Remarks" section suggests
that Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts were found at each site. All of the artifacts
are in his private collection. Although the site form does not mention the Archaic and
Late Prehistoric sites by number, the page of artifact descriptions makes it possible to
associate artifacts with two sites (41BL124 and 41BL125). According to Burleson, site
41BL125 contained an incised pottery sherd, a serrated flake, a possible boatstone, and
a Perdiz arrow point.
Based on observations by Mr. Burleson, the heaviest
concentrations of lithics and ceramics were at site 41BL125 (Carol Kehl, personal
communication, July 17, 1996).
Directly across the creek, at site 41BL124, Mr. Burleson collected a Scallorn
arrow point. These are the only artifacts that can be identified according to site from his
site form. In addition to these specimens, he found manos, hammerstones, a
perforated shell fragment classified by him as a sea shell pendant, an incised stone,
large and small knives, gravers, spokeshaves, end scrapers, scrapers, and dart points
which he typed as Castroville, Darl, Ensor, and Yarbrough.
Mr. Burleson discussed his work with the Principal Investigator and stated that
sites 41BL122 through 41BL126 are all Late Prehistoric. The two sites that contained
dart points, and are presumed by him to be Archaic, are 41BL124 and 41BL125. He
also showed the Principal Investigator the location of a prehistoric site that is out of the
project area. This site is still unrecorded. Some of the artifacts he has found during his
local investigations are still in his possession.
The Texas Department of Water Resources conducted an archeological
reconnaissance of a proposed wastewater collection and treatment improvement site in
1982 and 1984 (Fox and Whitsett 1984). This survey resulted in the identification and
recording of eight prehistoric sites (41BL259 - 41BL264 and 41BL278 - 41BL279).
According to Fox and Whitsett (1984:6), "some site-specific investigations have been
done in Bell County (Watt 1936; Shafer 1963), but as yet detailed archeological
investigations have not been conducted in the Temple-Belton area." Except for testing
at 41BL260, approximately 4000 meters southwest of the project area, by Wayne C.
Young (1987) of the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation,
Highway Design Division (now Texas Department of Transportation) in 1987, no
additional site-specific investigations were identified during the literature search for this
project.

12

In 1986 Carol Kehl investigated previously recorded sites along Pepper Creek.
Her effort resulted in a thesis and an M.S. degree in Environmental Studies at Baylor
University (Kehl 1987). Ms. Kehl visited sites 41BL122 - 41BL126 in 1986 with Bob
Burleson, the original recorder. She also obtained radiocarbon dates from three
samples from 41BL125 with funding from the Donors Fund provided by the Texas
Archeological Society. The samples, analyzed by the Radiocarbon Laboratory, The
University of Texas at Austin, were taken from charcoal stained soil (X-number 6440),
charcoal-stained soil from mussel shell hearth (X-number 6441), and charcoal stained
soil from a rock-lined hearth (X-number 6442). The dates are 3510 Â± 150 B.P. (6440),
3500Â±80 B.P. (6441), and 3740Â±160 B.P. (6442), respectively. Ms. Kehl also monitored
construction at 41BL180, a site on a tributary of Pepper Creek that was tested by the
Texas A&M University Anthropology Club in 1977. Site 41BL180 (the Childers site
[Childress site on the site form]) is described on the site form as an open campsite
containing Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components. The monitoring by Ms. Kehl
recovered additional artifacts, including a Brazos Fishtail point; thus, possibly extending
the date of this site to the Paleoindian period. At this time, not one of the site forms for
any of the previously recorded sites along Pepper Creek, including 41BL180, have been
updated. Documentation of her work in the form of her thesis, field notes, and some
artifacts remain in her possession.
Prior to this study, the most recent work in the county was conducted by BVRA.
A survey of a proposed sewer line along Fryer's Creek and both banks of the Leon
River (approximately 110 acres) were conducted by BVRA in June 1996 (Moore,
Bradle, and Nordt 1996a). No archaeological sites were found within the right-of-way,
although evidence of historic farmsteads was present in the area. One previously
unrecorded prehistoric site was found on a blufftop but not recorded.
In July 1996, BVRA examined a proposed sewer line 27,000 feet long
(approximately 21.7 acres) along Pepper Creek (Moore, Bradle, and Nordt 1996b).
Eight previously unrecorded archaeological sites were identified and recorded as
41BL1065 - 41BL1072. Sites 41BL1071 and 41BL1072 are out of the project area.
Sites 41BL1069 and 41BL1070 are buried in the broad active floodplain of Pepper
Creek, Bird Creek, and the Leon River. Cultural materials were found in separate
occupational levels from 50 cm to 220 cm below the modern ground surface. No
diagnostic artifacts were found at any of the eight sites.
Bell County contains numerous prehistoric and historic sites, many potentially
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archeological
Landmarks. However, certain sections of the county have not been adequately
investigated. There is reason to believe that a large number of unrecorded sites exist
along the major streams in eastern Bell County in the form of surface sites, possible
rock shelter sites, and buried sites. The reader is advised to consult the Fort Hood
series and other sources mentioned above for more specific investigations in other parts
of the county.

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, a background investigation was conducted. Site
records at TARL were checked for previously recorded sites in the project area and
vicinity, and site reports documenting work in the region were examined for information
concerning previous surveys and other work relevant to the project area. The project
was discussed with the City of Temple to ensure that the field crew was aware of the
exact route of the right-of-way.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished using the pedestrian survey method that
covered 100% of the project area. All exposed cutbanks and areas where surface
visibility was good were inspected for evidence of prehistoric and historic sites. No
backhoe trenching was considered necessary. The Project Archaeologist and the
Principal Investigator visited the project area with Leonard Henry, P.E. and George Dill,
Survey Crew Chief, both City of Temple employees, during the course of this survey.
During this visit, the Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist were advised of the
problems associated with connecting the two roads and the impact this project would
have on the area. George Dill was assigned the task of mapping the right-of-way. His
map not only includes the planned route of the connecting road, but it also depicts the
location of newly recorded site 41BL1073 and includes the areas disturbed by vandals
(Figure 4). Shovel testing was not conducted because of the large number (29) of
potholes (areas dug by relic collectors) left by vandals. Instead, the field crew
measured the depth of these disturbed areas and scraped the sides of certain potholes
with shovel and trowel to confirm the presence of cultural materials.
At the time of the field survey, the exact route of the road within the permanent
easement was not known as this project was still in the planning phase. The
boundaries of site 41BL1073 as in Figure 4 are determined by the top of the bluff to the
north where no cultural materials were observed, Canyon Creek to the south, the limits
of the project area to the east, and a fence to the west that separates the project area
from private property. No artifacts were collected by the survey crew, but the types of
artifacts, both prehistoric and historic, were noted.

14

The entire area was examined by the Principal Investigator and Project
Archeologist. In fact, the Project Archaeologist examined all 29 potholes and backdirt
for cultural materials in addition to walking over the rest of the site area. No shovel tests
were conducted on the bluff at the end of Hickory Road as this area has very shallow
soils and has been severely disturbed through construction of the church and parking
lot. The area has obviously been scraped and pushed. The historic component of
41BL1073 was confined mainly to the surface, although some artifacts appear to be
mixed in the topsoil that was pushed over the edge. The slope on the south bank of
Canyon Creek leading to Stratford Drive was also not shovel tested due to the absence
of soils and its steep vertical relief. The top of this slope where Hickory Road will
connect with Stratford Drive is also lacking in soils and was not shovel tested.
Local informants mentioned sites on the bluff above Canyon Creek in the vicinity
of Stratford Drive, but no evidence of prehistoric activity was observed on the surface. It
is assumed that any site in this area is on top of the bluff, possibly due south, away from
the project area. No attempt was made to locate any sites out of the project area.

16

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Background Research
A check of site records at TARL and a literature review revealed no
archaeological sites had been recorded in the current project area. In Bell County,
however, 1069 prehistoric and historic sites have been recorded prior to this project
(Carolyn Spock, personal communication, August 5, 1996). Large-scale federal
projects such as Belton Reservoir, Stillhouse Reservoir and Fort Hood have recorded
the vast majority of sites in the county (see Culture Sequence and Previous
Investigations above).
Field Survey
The field survey identified and recorded one previously unrecorded
archaeological site (41BL1073) on the north side of Canyon Creek containing both
prehistoric and historic components. The historic component consists of fragments of
bottle glass and crockery jars, metal cans, unidentified metal objects mixed with recent
trash concentrated on the slope of the bluff above the prehistoric component. Based on
the historic artifacts observed on the surface, this component dates primarily to the early
20th century. It is believed that the historic trash was pushed over the edge by a
bulldozer during construction of the church or an earlier building. What appears to be
topsoil mixed with the historic artifacts strongly suggests that this is the case. Some of
the artifacts could have been thrown over the edge by local residents. The presence of
historic trash on the steep slope of a bluff is not uncommon. Numerous similar trash
scatters occur in Central Texas, and many have been officially recorded at Fort Hood.
This component is separate from the prehistoric component, approximately 125 x 150
feet in size (Figure 4), and not considered significant in terms of research potential.
The prehistoric component is situated on a low terrace adjacent to Canyon
Creek. The site has been vandalized as evidenced by 29 potholes, with one dug to a
depth of 2.2 meters and a diameter of 3.5 meters (Appendix II). An intensive surface
inspection revealed the presence of burned rock, mussel shell, flakes, and a possible
quartzite hammerstone. This component covers the entire east-west limits of the
project, area as currently defined, and extends upslope at least to the 501 foot contour
interval. Current estimates of its size are 75 x 200 feet. Intact deposits are present
between the potholes and probably beneath some of the backdirt from the potholes.
Examination of the vandalized area revealed that potholes 1-6 and 29 were devoid of
cultural materials; therefore, since cultural materials were observed in pothole 7, it is
assumed that the prehistoric component does not extend beyond this area. Another
important observation is the lack of cultural materials in any pothole below 60
centimeters.

17

The presence of burned rock and mussel shell suggest a campsite, and the
flakes and possible hammerstone are indicative of the manufacture and/or refurbishing
of stone tools. Since this site is in close proximity to the creek bed in a narrow canyon it
seems reasonable to assume that there were periods when high water forced the
occupants to leave for higher ground. We noted a high density of colluvial and alluvial
gravels intermixed with cultural deposits. In recent years water from heavy rains has
reached the top of the canyon. The number of flakes observed on the surface was low
considering the size of the site and amount of disturbance.
Therefore, it is
hyphothesized that flakes and other small objects could move downstream away from
the site during periods of flooding. It is also possible that datable materials such as
pollen, bone, and charcoal could have been likewise adversely affected. Therefore, the
research potential of this site may have been comprised as a result of flooding. The
prehistoric component appears to have intact deposits. If these deposits have not been
affected by flooding as suggested above, this portion of 41BL1073 is considered
significant. As stated above, site 41BL1073 has been severely affected by relic
collectors. Appendix II presents the diameter and depth of each pothole as shown in
Figure 4.
The western limits of this site are not known as the area available for survey was
defined on the west by a fence denoting private property. Overall, it appears that a
significant portion of the site has been disturbed, and it is difficult to assess the amount
of intact deposits remaining. The area adjacent to the creek where the City of Temple
plans to place a culvert is in an area that will have little, if any, effect on the site proper.
The proposed culvert is a two-barrel box culvert that will be 4 feet high, 16 feet wide (8
feet on each side of the creek), and approximately 150 feet long. As depicted in Figure
4, based on the cluster of potholes, the main site area appears to be north and west of
the creek crossing, clearly away from the site of the proposed culvert.
Since no diagnostic artifacts were found the age of this site is not known. Based
on the presence of mussel shell, burned rock, and chert flakes, it is assumed this area
was used as a campsite, although possibly seasonally. Because this area floods
frequently much of the datable materials such as pollen and charcoal could have
washed away, and datable materials, other than projectile points, may be absent or
scarce.
The east and west site boundaries, as discussed above, are defined by
limitations imposed by the project area. It is likely that the prehistoric component
extends in both directions past the fence to the west and the easement to the east. The
historic component appears to be fairly restricted to the project area alignment.

18

RECOMMENDATIONS
The current survey of the Stratford - Hickory Road Connection in Bell County,
Texas performed for the City of Temple identified one archaeological site (41BL1073).
This site contains a prehistoric and historic component. The historic component is not
considered eligible for listing as a State Archeological Landmark. The prehistoric
component, however, contains intact deposits and is considered eligible for listing as a
State Archeological Landmark. It is recommended that the prehistoric component be
subjected to Phase II testing if avoidance of these intact deposits is not possible.
The City of Temple prefers to protect this site. Given this course of action, it is
recommended that "clean fill" be placed over the entire site area and buffer zone and
efforts be made to control destruction of the protected areas from erosion. Any
subsurface disturbance in the site area should be placed in disturbed areas if possible;
otherwise, it is recommended that test units be placed in these areas to collect data
regarding the site and mitigate the areas for construction.
Local informants state that cultural materials have been found on top of the bluff
opposite 41BL1073. The terrace, slope, and bluff top were examined for artifacts but no
evidence of a site was found. Since an exact location of this site was not provided it is
believed that, if it is in the immediate vicinity, it is most likely to the south and west on
private land. Should, however, the route of the Stratford-Hickory Road Connection be
significantly altered in either direction, it is recommended that this new alignment be
examined for cultural materials.
