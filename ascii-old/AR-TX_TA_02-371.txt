Abstract
Flatrock Enginering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources linear survey of the Knotts
Prairie Lateral right-of-way in Howard and Martin counties, Texas. The Area of Potential Effect
is 15 miles long x 80 feet wide, for a total of 145.5 acres. The entire right-of-way will cross
publicly owned properties, and the entire project is privately funded; thus no state Antiquities
Permit was required. In addition, there are no U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional areas.
A thorough pedestrian survey was conducted by four archaeologists on April 14 and 15, 2015. The
only evidence of cultural material observed was an historic trash scatter and a farmstead site dating
to the mid-1900s (41MT75 and 41MT76). Although interesting, these sites are not considered as
significant to the history of west Texas. Otherwise, shallow and eroded soils were exposed in
plowed agricultural fields along roughly 95 percent of the right-of-way. In addition, the small
drainages observed were shallow, broad, and ephemeral, with little or no evidence of terrace
building. In sum, we recommended that the Knotts Prairie Lateral be allowed to be constructed
as currently aligned, with no additional archaeological investigations.
However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any undiscovered cultural resources are
encountered during development along the lateral, such finds should be examined and evaluated
by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly three individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. Wade Ingle,
Senior Partner at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd., and Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr.
Brannon Norton, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. All were
extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall knowledge of the project
contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of work.
It was indeed a pleasure working with Contract Land Specialists Kala Carter and Scott Allen at
Navigator Energy Services, LLC from their office in Big Springs.
Another individual who was extremely helpful in the completion of this report is Joel Butler who
masterfully created the map overlays presented. In addition, I very much relied upon Crew Chief
David (Emory) Worrell, and archaeological Field Technicians Belisario Silva and Steven Schooler
with Tierras Antiguas. They are dedicated individuals, and as always, these three “hosses” worked
meticulously to ensure all aspects of this investigation were thoroughly documented in accordance
with Texas Historical Commission and Council of Texas Archeologists standards.

Introduction
Navigator Energy
Services, LLC of
Big Spring, Texas
is the lead agency
for the Knotts
Prairie Lateral that
is proposed for
construction
through privately
owned properties
in Howard and
Martin counties in
northwestern
Texas (Figures 17).

and cultural
assessments would be conducted in a professional compliance manner. At the request of Flatrock,
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) conducted a cultural resources survey of
the Project Area (PA) during the period April 14 and 15, 2015.
The project is privately funded, and will cross privately owned properties; thus no Texas
Antiquities permit was required, and there are no stream crossings under the jurisdiction of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).

Geology
As shown in Figure 6, the
Knotts Prairie Lateral will
cross over and through
two geological formations
(Barnes 1994; Judson and
Kaufman 1990):
The Blackwater Draw
Formation (Qbd) is
slightly younger than the
Ogallala Formation,
forming during the early
Pleistocene Epoch, and
early Quaternary Period.
Eolian in nature, it
consists of fine-grained
quartz, silty loams and
clay loams found on
upland areas in this area
of northwest Texas
(Holliday 1989).
Sand Sheet deposits (Qsu)
occur along the southernmost portion of the Knotts
Prairie Lateral (see Figure
6). These are also
windblown sands and silts
much like those of the
Blackwater Draw
Formation, and of an Figure 6. Geological map of the Project Area.
approximated same antiquity. Sand Sheet deposits are commonly found on dunes and dune ridges.

Soils
As shown in Figures 7-9, the Knotts Prairie Lateral will dissect 17 different soil types that are of
varying depths, resulting primarily from eolian processes. As such, these various soil
classifications otherwise imply the potential for the preservation of intact cultural resources to

Elevations, Rivers, and Streams
Elevations above mean sea level (amsl) range from 2,616 feet in northeastern Howard County to
3,000 feet in southwestern Martin County. In Howard County, the major drainages are the North
Concho River, as well as Morgan and Wild Horse creeks (Long 1996). In Martin County, a
tributary of the Colorado River drains the northern portion of the county, while Mustang Creek, a
tributary of the North Concho River drains the southern portion of the county.
Flora, Fauna, and Climate

within the Great Plains
region. However, the
Project Area lies just
below the High Plains
area, near the Caprock
escarpment. The High
Plains are highest in
their southern most
portion, on the Llano
Estacado Caprock,
with elevations
reaching over 3,200 ft
above mean sea level
(amsl). Running from
the northern portion of
the Texas Panhandle
southward into Central
Texas, the Caprock
escarpment forms an
abrupt boundary
between the flat Llano
Estacado and the
deeply incised and
rapidly eroding
Caprock Canyonlands
along its eastern edge. Figure 10. Physiographic Regions of Texas (2015).

Canyonlands become less rugged and incised as the southeasterly flowing rivers broaden their
valleys, and enter the Lower Plains region, encompassing generally rolling, low hills and ridges
(Boyd 1995; Parsons 1967; Carroll 1996). The topography of the Project Area is generally typified
by an undulating nearly level to rolling landscape with predominately rangelands on loamy and dry
soils. However, portions of the Project Area in Howard County lie at the eastern tip of the Permian
Basin, at the southeastern edge of the Llano Estacado Caprock, and near the western edge of the
Edwards Plateau.

includes the

The Permian red

several species of grama, and buffalo grass. These mesquite plains further exhibit areas of mesquite
mottes and a few other shrubs, interspersed by large areas of grasses, as well as forbs such as
broomweed and gaillardia. Interspersed are also shin-oak and sand sage.
However, the Kansan Province is drained by numerous rivers and intermittent lesser streams that
allow for larger trees such as oak, elms, hackberries, and maples to survive and thrive. Understory
cedars are also prominent in such environs. At least 59 mammal species have been catalogued
within the Kansan Province, as well as land turtles, 14 species of lizards, and 31 snake species.

The modern climate of the Project Area is classified as semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall
of roughly 16 to 20 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with
average daily maximum temperatures averaging about 960F in July, to around 290F degrees in
January. The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in frequent droughts
as well as sporadic periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of roughly 214-217
days (Hunt and Leffler 1996; Long 1996).

Cultural Context and Chronology
The Project Area presumes
cultural affinities both
indigenous to the western
edge of the north-central
Texas region as well as
intrusive influences from
the Southern Great Plains
(Figure 12). Several
scholars have offered
sound but differing
arguments for cultural
chronologies for the
Southern Great Plains
extending into northern
Texas. The cultural
chronology, defined by
complex (in lieu of the
terms phase, interval, or
period) of the North
American High Plains has
been synthesized by
Hofman et al. (1989), and
m o r e r e c e n t l y, t h e
Southern High Plains in Figure 12. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
Texas by Johnson and Black 1989).
Holliday (1995) and Boyd
(1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in
climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of
change in central and south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Johnson
and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate and
given as years before present (B.P.).

13

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited the landscape before 11,500 B.P, solid evidence does not
support their existence. Although human behavior is inferred on stone artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site (Fox et al. 1992:51-73), all are problematic. At Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of north-central Texas, radiocarbon dates initially believed to be from burned
charcoal in human campfires, and approximating an antiquity of 40,000 years were later disproved
as dates on natural coal (Stanford 1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic proof
of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on stable
landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell County,
Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and with artifacts
stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances of providing
conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins
and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains were
occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people who
made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented the
presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called “Goshen” may be present (Hofman et al. 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
A well-documented Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains is the McLean site in
Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites in the area
include the Scharbauer site in northwestern Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and the
Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan County (Tunnel 1977). A fourth site nearby containing
a Milnesand component is Lone Wolf Creek in northeastern Mitchell County (Wormington 1957).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in Bell
14

County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison (Bison
antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940), archaeological
evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either extinct or
otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and
other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required technological shifts
that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman etal.
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano Estacado
from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of megafauna and the
changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral change by the
Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic hunter-gatherer
adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was necessary.
In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas, such as deer, fish, and
plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock cooking
features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et
al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were small and highly mobile, an
inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed and that diagnostic types are
seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that
the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the inhabitants to broaden their diets to
pursue plants and animals which would produce the same amount of calories and protein with the
same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi)
argues that the Knotts Prairie Lateral area was used more frequently in the Early Archaic than in
the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of bison and other game animals on the
Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that population densities were low during this
period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few constraints on
their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse utilization of a wide range
of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents,
rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
15

ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285). Hurt
(1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains decreased,
and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely
scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut harvests
in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black 1989a).
Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment
led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely scattered
bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering
season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn
harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens are a result of this
endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt this conclusion (e.g.,
Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock middens are still a matter of
controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems
to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants
(Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of
accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community,
but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about 4500
B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites, at least in
the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as the
Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or fell
during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of burned
rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the Blue Hole
site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32 (Black et
al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens at Camp
Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County (Houk and
Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in diameter were still
very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have become less
16

specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base (Black 1989b:30).
Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains area, and we see an
increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the Late Archaic.
However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story (1985:44-45)
believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981), Hitzfelder Cave
(Givens 1968), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic populations in central
and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt (1980) further posits that
population in the Knotts Prairie Lateral area peaked during the Late Archaic with groups moving
into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found in the region were more
closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still "pre-ceramic" until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45-47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points.
The most common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011), both of which are short, triangular
points with side notches. The Frio point also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt (1980)
presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's (1974)
contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes, which also
lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including
the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery. Two complexes
following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from about
2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts into
rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977; Skinner
1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the
South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to Hurt
(1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is mirrored
17

in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due to the
increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited European
contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The cultural
context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence of outside
ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos and
Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed in
many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb
1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and
Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969;
Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on the
Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache adapted
to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the Spaniards
(Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another group of
nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas (Campbell
1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to warfare
fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among them
(Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages have been
lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and
Campbell 1992).

Site Types to be Expected Along the Knotts Prairie Lateral
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Howard and Martin counties are prehistoric open
campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period. Some of these
represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped for
one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of people
that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these same
campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these large
campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing multiple
hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from making them,
18

ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and
aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites
occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine environment that offered a
wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water
sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different food source that could be
exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave
hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the northern South Texas Plains,
and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along the
Knotts Prairie Lateral. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that
were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The
general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites
suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time (However,
small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more
knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings or
surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of
chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes removed,
called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality of stone
that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble
to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the cobble was
tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality,
coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away from these sites,
what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces
of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large
cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides,
reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make
finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not
found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where
raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use,
so they are discarded and left behind.

19

Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found on
any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops that
were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried today,
and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and lithic scatters in the
three-county area have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland
slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but differ
from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at times they
specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were not yet freed
from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types of sites are rare
in Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not present themselves, and 2)
throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up gravels from the surface than
to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone remains likely to be found at these
sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well as parent material detritus, and
flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected. Although a handful of prehistoric
quarry sites have been recorded in this area of Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much
like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the
larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective
as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable,
another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched
out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion
of the formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in this
area of Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites
in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams.
Historic Sites
Although Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th
century, and Spanish entradas began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no
record of any sort of permanent structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the
North area was generally not considered safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in
1865, and white settlers then began establishing smaller ranches and farmlands.
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of this
area of Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
20

most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.

Howard County History
Situated on the eastern edge of the Permian Basin, the southern edge of the Caprock, and the
western edge of the Edwards Plateau, Howard County was uniquely situated for nomadic
prehistoric Native Americans, early explorers, and later Spanish and Anglo-American settlers. Most
attractive in both prehistoric and historic times was the spring at Big Spring on Sulphur Draw, near
the modern-day city appropriately named Big Spring. Within a generally arid landscape, the
naturally flowing spring attracted coyotes, wolves, and herds of buffalo, antelope, and mustangs.
As such the spring also attracted humans for millennia. The earliest written historic accounts
indicate that both the Comanche and the Shawnee camped at the spring, and fought for the right
to do so (Hazelwood and Ordintz 1996).
Strategically located along the Overland Trail to California, when Captain Randolph Marcy
mapped the trail in 1849, he designated the Signal Mountain Peak area as a recommended campsite.
The Signal Mountains lie roughly nine miles southeast of Big Spring (Tyler 1996). Signal
Mountain, ten miles southeast of Big Spring, was a landmark used by early cattlemen. “In 1849
Capt. Randolph B. Marcy's expedition reached Big Spring on the return trip from Santa Fe and
marked it as a campsite on the Overland Trail to California. The spring was also a campsite on the
Santa Fe Trail from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to El Paso. Early ranchers, among them Adolph Miller
and C. C. Slaughter, reached the area in the late 1870s, and after the ranchers came four-section
plots with squatters' dugouts. In the late 1870s the community of Big Spring began near the spring
as a settlement of hide huts and saloons for buffalo hunters. In 1880 the Texas and Pacific built
through the area, following the line of Sulphur Draw several miles north of the spring. The
community moved to the tracks, and Big Spring became the site of railroad shops and a station.
When Howard County was organized in 1882, Big Spring became the county seat. That same year
a post office started operating in the community, and its first general store opened. By 1884 Big
Spring had an estimated population of 1,200, six saloons, four general stores, and a weekly
newspaper (the Pantagraph). Several private schools were operating in the community by 1890, and
the town had a public school by 1898" (Hazelwood and Ordintz 1996:537-538).
A series of droughts and other factors in the early 1900s forced the large ranches to either
significantly downsize or sell out altogether. However, a boon to the economy of Howard County
came in the 1920s in the form of an oil boom, and the population increased three-fold. The number
of farms also increased, and although the Great Depression forced many out of business, the oil and
gas business remained a mainstay, just as it is today (Long 1996).

Martin County History
Although evidence of Native American presence for several thousand years within what was to
become the modern political boundary of Martin County has been well documented
archaeologically, written documents are only extant beginning with the 1700s. It is clear that the
Comanches displaced the Apaches, and then dominated this area of west Texas by about 1750.
Then, in the 1870s, the United States Army forced the Comanches from the region, opening the
area for white settlers. By 1876, lands were set aside from the vast Bexar County for the
establishment of Martin County. During an interim period from 1876 through 1884, the
administration of Martin County was attached first to Mitchell County, and then to Howard County.
Finally, in 1884, there were enough citizens in present-day Martin County so that its own
government was established, and Stanton (previously named Mariensfield) became the county seat.
At that time, springs in this area of west Texas were still flowing; one of those well known to
Indians and the U.S. Army was at what today is known as Mustang Pond, the first water source that
emigrants encountered some two miles west of modern-day Big Spring.
In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Rail Line was built through the Big Spring area, and spurred an
expansion of population in Martin County. New settlers moved into the area and began cattle
ranching and sheep ranching endeavors, and farmed grain, cotton, vegetables, and orchards. To
supplement their subsistence, they hunted wild game such as antelope, deer, quail, a the few buffalo
that remained on the open prairie/grassland.
By 1890, the number of settlers in Martin County had increased from only 12 ten years before, to
262. By 1900, the population had increased to 332. By 1920, cotton became the major cash crop.
Much like the rest of the nation, the Great Depression of the 1930s affected this rural area of west
Texas. Nevertheless, Martin County’s economy rebounded during WWII. By the 1940s, there were
over 22,000 acres being farmed in Martin County.
Oil and gas production came relatively late to Martin County compared to the rest of the
surrounding Permian Basin region. Although a few wells were drilled in Martin County the 1920s,
the only significantly producing well did not come in until 1945. Then, in 1950, several deep oil
fields were discovered, and an oil boom was underway (Stoner and Dixon 1974; Hunt and Leffler
1996). Thanks to modern technology such as horizontal drilling and fracturing in the early part of
the 21st century, the citizens and ranchers of Martin County are once again experiencing a robust
economy.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within Howard County and Martin County, the results simply provide the data that
is available. In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed
based upon the types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. To wit,
22

a review of the Texas Atlas indicated that there were only three known archaeological sites within
one mile of the Project Area. That said, the data that is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good
as the surveys represent. The vast majority of Howard and Martin County has never been subjected
to formal cultural resource surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological
record is very poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished
provide at least some aspect of what the area looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Howard County
As of April 20, 2015 there were 122 archaeological sites recorded within Howard County. Evidence
of ancient hearths, along with diagnostic projectile points indicate that 61 of these sites had been
used as open campsites from as early as the Paleoindian period, and through as late as the Late
Prehistoric periods. Thirty-two of the 122 sites have been classified as lithic scatters, where an
abundance of chipped stone with more than a few temporal diagnostics also indicate these sites
were being used from the Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric periods. At 13 of the sites, the chert,
quartzite, and other cobbles/gravels that were exposed to the surface have been tested and used to
manufacture stone tools over several thousand years. Other prehistoric sites within Howard County
include two documented rock shelters, two areas where bison bones were eroding from cutbanks,
and two locales with mammoth bones, one of which had Paleoindian dart points in association.
Historically, a total of 12 components have been recorded. These include 1880s through 1950s
farmsteads, house sites, and trash dumps/scatters, and a Civilian Conservation Camp from the
1930s. The only documented State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) in Howard County is the
Patton-Hayden House in Big Spring (Atlas 2015).
Martin County
A total of 69 archaeological sites had been recorded in Martin County as of April 20, 2015. Fortyseven of those are prehistoric open campsites, and five are prehistoric lithic scatters. Notably, some
of the more significant campsites and lithic scatters are adjacent to playa lakes. At one Early
Archaic campsite an ancient well believed to date to that time period was documented. In addition,
pottery sherds such as Chupadero Black-on-White, Brushed brownware, El Paso polychrome, and
Ochoa indented have been found, indicating either long distance trade or adopted ceramic
technology and styles. The 23 historic components documented in Martin County consist of
numerous late 1800s and early 1900s trash dumps and scatters. However there are also late 1800s
and early 1900s farmsteads and house sites, WWI bombing range practice targets, and the site of
Carmelite Monastery/Sisters of Mercy Convent in Stanton.
Previously Documented Archaeological Sites and Surveys
The northern-most segment of the Navigator Midstream Knotts Prairie Lateral is shown in Figure
3. A review of the Texas Atlas indicates that there had been only one professional archaeological
survey conducted within one mile of this northern segment. It was conducted by Archaeological
Consultants, Inc. in 2011 for Wind Energy Transmission of Texas and the Public Utilities
Commission (PUC). The only site discovered within one mile of the proposed Knotts Prairie
Lateral was 41HW92. At that time, archaeologists described 41HW92 as a prehistoric lithic scatter
situated in a cultivated cotton field. As such, the probable Nolan dart point (Middle Archaic) and
seven flakes found on the surface were assessed as in disturbed contexts (Atlas 2015).

23

As shown in Figures 4 and 5 there are no documented archaeological surveys or sites within one
mile of these segments of the proposed Knotts Prairie Lateral. Although the terrain through these
segments is relatively unremarkable, and suggests a minimal potential for buried, intact, and thus
significant archaeological deposits, without an on-the-ground physical survey, this assessment can
only be surmised.

Background Review Summary
From this preliminary cultural resources background review, it was clear that the proposed
Navigator Energy Systems Knotts Prairie Lateral right-of-way in all probability, would encounter
previously undocumented archaeological sites. This is best manifested by the scant few
professional surveys that have been conducted in Howard and Martin counties. Some of the sites
that are likely to be encountered along the Knotts Prairie Lateral right-of-way may be heavily
disturbed and/or redundant site types, and as such have little to contribute to the prehistory of south
Texas. These sites should be considered as non-significant, and should not impede the pipeline’s
construction as planned. However, it is also clear from this review that there is a moderate to high
probability that archaeological sites of significance could lie in the planned right-of-way.
Although the number of sites in this area of Texas, and their potential significance can be modeled,
because of the scant few professional surveys that have been conducted in these areas to date, under
less stringent standards, such models are considered unreliable. Accordingly, without an on-theground archaeological survey, the ubiquity of archaeological sites and their scientific research
potential along the Navigator Knotts Prairie Lateral would remain an unknown.
In sum, it appeared that the pipeline is to be routed through areas that may be sensitive to
archaeological deposits. To be sure of our desktop assessment, Tierras Antiguas recommended that
a full pedestrian survey, with shovel testing in moderate and high probability areas, be conducted
along the Navigator Knotts Prairie Lateral right-of-way.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework
is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the regions.
The historic framework is structured around the 1800s and 1900s settlement in the area as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests, government representatives, and
early Anglo-American settlers, through the Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty periods,
and into the Texas Statehood period.

24

The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

In addition, all
cutbanks, and rodent and mammal backdirt piles along the right-of-way were thoroughly examined.
Approximately 14.7 miles (98 percent) of the 15-mile right-of-way courses through recently
cultivated fields where surface visibility was greater than 95 percent (see for example, Figure 13).
Otherwise, the remaining, roughly 0.3 miles of pipeline is to be constructed through pasturelands,
where surface visibility was estimated greater than 70 percent.

25

In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both
prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via
sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts,
particularly those artifacts which could be considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas
prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were
to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator
and/or the Project Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences
adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in this report of
investigations.
The two archaeological sites discovered were mapped using a pace-and-compass method, as well
as a GPS. Field notes were made about the sites and a sketch maps were drawn. Digital photographs
of the sites and selected artifacts were taken, as well as selected photographs representing the
surveyed right-of-way in general, and a photo log was maintained.

Results of the Investigations
Typically, fine sandy loam and clay loam soils with fragmented caliche were encountered in the
western and central portions of the ROW, while fine sands and fine sandy loams were present along
the eastern portion. Notably, generally absent were gravels suitable for fashioning stone tools. Two
historic sites (41MT75 and 41MT76), were documented during the survey; they are described
below. In addition, one potentially historic structure was observed along the periphery of the rightof-way.
41MT75
Description
This site is a ca. 1940 thru 1980s farmstead in a rural area of northeast Martin County, but at an
intersection of modern-day farm to Marker Road 1785 (CR4400) and CR 4701 (Figure 14). Along
the periphery of the proposed Knotts Prairie ROW, there are the concrete foundation remains of
a wood frame house, an apparent wooden garage with a concrete floor, two wood framed
outbuildings, and a steel windmill structure with an adjoining steel platform for a raised water tank
(see Figures 14-18). These areas encompass approximately 2.7 acres situated on a low knoll in an
otherwise generally flat and slightly sloping upland plain. Although the lands for miles around are
currently under cultivation, since the farmstead was abandoned perhaps 20-30 years ago, the
immediate area is gradually being overgrown with low mesquite tress, assorted cacti, and dense
herbaceous weeds and grasses.
Levels of Effort and Results
Archaeologists conducted a thorough examination of the site’s surface within the pipeline’s 80-foot
ROW and observed a handful of clear glass bottle sherds with no hue, and one whiteware sherd

26

with no decorations or makers marks, an enameled tinware pot, a handful of reddish orange bricks,
and two steel barrel hoops (see Figures 19 and 20) .
The red brick with orange tint shown in Figure 20 bears the “Ferris” maker’s. The Ferris Brick
Company was founded in Farris, Texas, in Ellis County, north of Waxahachie, and has been in
continuous operation since 1901. The presence of Ferris bricks found at a site in this region of
Texas is not surprising. The Ferris Brick Company received worldwide recognition, and distributed
bricks via wagons, and later via railways throughout Texas (Dunn 2015; Steinbomer 1980).

Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This site appears to have been a farmstead with several outbuildings and pens that was occupied
from perhaps the 1940s through the 1960s or 1970s. Only one structure appears on a 1966
topographic map; likely the house structure. Notably, we observed a paucity of artifacts within the
ROW. However, a trash scatter likely associated with this site was documented in a cultivated field
some 300 meters to the west (41MT76).
Although additional archival investigations beyond the scope of this Phase I survey would be
interesting, in its current condition, other than its historic value as a mid-20th century farmstead in
this locale of Martin County and west Texas, we access the site as possessing minimal research
potential. As such, we recommend no further archaeological investigations within the pipeline’s
ROW, and that the construction of the pipeline be allowed to proceed as planned. However, we
further recommend that before any additional impact to the site is proposed, archival investigations
should be conducted to ascertain a detailed history of the site.

41MT76
Description
41MT76 (Figures 21 and 22) is a dispersed
surface scatter of circa 1950s through
1970s historic glass and metal situated on
a gentle southwestern facing upland slope
that has been cultivated and artificially
terraced for farming in the historic past. As
such, there is no vegetation on the site, and
surface visibility was greater than 95
percent across the site’s surface. Surface
elevation at the site ranges from 2,8672,869 feet above mean sea level (amsl).
Soils on the site are mapped as Acuff loam
(AcA), commonly found on 0 to 1 percent
slopes in this area of Martin County.
Levels of Effort and Results
A thorough examination of the heavily
disturbed surface was conducted. The
sparsely scattered artifacts were dispersed
across an area of roughly 1,200 square
meters. Artifacts observed included bottle
and dinnerware glass sherds, along with Figure 21. 41MT76 site map.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey was conducted by four archaeologists on April 14 and 15, 2015. The
only evidence of cultural material observed was an historic trash scatter and a farmstead site dating
to the mid-1900s. Although interesting, these sites are not considered as significant to the history
of west Texas. Otherwise, shallow and eroded soils were exposed in plowed agricultural fields along
roughly 95 percent of the right-of-way. In addition, the small drainages observed were shallow,
broad, and ephemeral, with little or no evidence of terrace building. In sum, we recommend that the
Knotts Prairie Lateral be allowed to be constructed as currently aligned, with no additional
archaeological investigations.
However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any undiscovered cultural resources are
encountered during development along the lateral, such finds should be examined and evaluated by
Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant. No artifacts were collected and
curated during this project.
