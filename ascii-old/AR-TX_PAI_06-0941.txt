ABSTRACT
On July 31, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive
archeological survey of 8.1 acres to be developed for a new bicycle park under the 2017 Bond
Program adjacent to existing facilities at Pearsall Park in southwest San Antonio, Texas. The
survey was done under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 9018. The new bicycle park will include
a new entrance and roadway connecting to an existing park entrance, three parking lots with
various bicycle areas specific for children to improve their bike skills, a pavilion, a restroom
building, a new multi-use path, and a culvert/low-water crossing. No historic or prehistoric
sites were identified by this survey within the footprint of these proposed improvements, and
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., recommends that development should proceed without additional
archeological investigations.

CURATION
Since this archeological survey did not recover any artifacts, this project does not require
artifact curation. Project records and photographs currently housed at the offices of Prewitt
and Associates, Inc., will be transferred to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas at Austin for permanent curation.

INTRODUCTION
On July 31, 2019, two staff archeologists with Prewitt and Associates, Inc.,
conducted an intensive survey of 8.1 acres to be developed as a new bicycle park
under the City’s 2017 Bond Program adjacent to existing facilities at Pearsall Park
in southwest San Antonio, Texas (Figure 1). The survey was done under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 9018. The proposed improvements will include a new entrance
for vehicles and pedestrians off of Old Pearsall Road north of a SAWS water tank and
a road connecting the new entrance to an existing entrance south of the water tank
(Figure 2). Three parking lots will be added with various bicycle areas specific for
children to improve their bike skills. A pavilion and restroom building with associated
utilities (water, sewer, and electric) will be added north of the new entrance. Directly
behind the water tank, a new multi-use path will connect to the existing trail. The
connection to an existing parking lot in the main part of the park to the south will
require a culvert/low-water crossing on a drainage channel with grading on both
sides of the crossing. At most locations, disturbance will extend no more than 1 ft
below the surface, with deeper disturbance where the culvert/low-water crossing
will be. All work done during this survey complies with the requirements of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter
191, VTCS 6145-9) and the City of San Antonio’s Historic Preservation and Design
Section of the Unified Development Code (Article 6 35-360-634).
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Geologic Atlas of Texas maps the project area as Pleistocene fluviatile
terrace deposits associated with Leon Creek, which is at the eastern edge of the
park (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983). Leon Creek flows south to the Medina
River; both streams are part of the San Antonio River watershed. According to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Web Soil Survey, soils over most of the survey area
are Houston Black clay, with Heiden-Ferris complex soils, severely eroded, along the
south edge. The former are developed in clayey residuum weathered from calcareous
Cretaceous mudstone, and the latter are developed in residuum weathered from
calcareous Cretaceous shale and marl. Because of its proximity to Leon Creek, the
area could have been attractive to Native Americans as a camp location. The nature
of the soils indicates that any sites present would be shallowly buried, however.
Vegetation in the survey area mainly consists of mature hackberry trees with an
open understory of sparse grasses and forbs (Figure 3a). The southern edge of the
survey area along the existing park entrance and drainage channel supports a dense
cover of second-growth trees and thick grasses (Figure 3b).
RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
Prior to the field survey, a review of the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that there are two previously recorded sites and
five previous archeological investigations within 1 km of the project area at Pearsall
Park. The sites are 41BX598 and 41BX1933. Site 41BX598 is 0.6 km southeast of the
project area on the west side of Leon Creek. It was recorded in 1983 as a sparse lithic
scatter. Site 41BX1933 is 0.3 km northeast of the project area, west of Leon Creek

and just south of Military Drive. Recorded in 2012. It is the Rodriguez/Leal/Dwyer
Farmstead complex, which was designated a City of San Antonio Landmark in 2008.
Site 41BX1933 was documented during survey for the SAWS Western Watershed
Sewer Relief Project (Dowling 2013). Another previous investigation consisted of
survey of a segment of the Leon Creek Hike-and-Bike Trail from Old Pearsall Road
southward. The north end of this area was along the south edge of the current
project area; no sites were found there, and no evidence of previously recorded site
41BX598 was observed (Galindo 2010). The third previous investigation in the area
consisted of monitoring of improvements at a Kelly Air Force Base building south
of Military Drive on the east side of Leon Creek (Anderson and Sullivan 2018); no
archeological remains were found. The Atlas contains no information for the other
two previous investigations, one along Leon Creek to the southeast and the other
in a residential area to the west.
Historic aerial photographs and maps indicate that no historic improvements
were located in the project area. This review included 1903 and 1953 USGS maps,
1918 and 1927 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maps, and aerial photographs taken
in 1953, 1963, and 1973. Hence, the project area appears to have a low potential
for historic archeological sites.
Overall, the pre-survey file search suggested that the project area has a
moderate potential for Native American archeological sites and a low potential
for historic archeological sites. While any sites present would be on the surface
or shallowly buried, the absence of previous development on the tract, apart from
the existing water tank, would suggest that the area has not been substantially
disturbed.
METHODS OF FIELD INVESTIGATION
The archeological survey of the new development at the north end of Pearsall
Park consisted of 100 percent pedestrian coverage by two qualified archeologists. As
per the Texas Historical Commission’s minimum survey standards, the archeologists
walked the survey area on transects spaced no more than 30 m apart, examining
surface exposures for evidence of prehistoric and historic artifacts and features.
Shovel testing was employed where the ground surface was obscured by vegetation.
Shovel tests were 30 cm in diameter and excavated in levels not exceeding 20 cm
in thickness. All sediments removed during shovel testing were screened through
1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth or carefully sorted with a trowel when too difficult
to screen efficiently. A Shovel Test Record form was used to record brief sediment
descriptions and notes about artifact recovery for each shovel test. All shovel test
locations were recorded with a handheld GPS unit.
Fourteen shovel tests were excavated across the proposed bicycle park.
This is slightly lower than the minimum density specified in the Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas for projects of this size (2
tests per acre), but ground surface visibility over much of the area was better than
30 percent, obviating the need for shovel testing in this nondepositional high terrace
setting. Photographs were taken of survey conditions, and a photo log and daily

6

journal of project activities and observations were kept by a project archeologist.
All survey methods comply with applicable standards defined or referenced in 13
TAC 26.20 and Texas Historical Commission policy.
SURVEY RESULTS
The intensive archeological survey of the proposed bicycle park at the north end of
Pearsall Park encountered no prehistoric or historic sites. Although the area has
not been previously developed, it has seen impacts from construction of the SAWS
water tank on its west central edge, by drainage flowing off of Old Pearsall Road, and
by occasional flooding of Leon Creek to the east of the park boundary. The drainage
and flooding have caused soil erosion, as evidenced by many small channels and rills
that crisscross the area and have exposed abundant gravels (Figure 4a). This flow
of water appears to be mitigated to some degree by deep drainage channels at the
north and south ends of the project area; these channels cross onto park property
though culverts under Old Pearsall Road. Erosion and an open grassy understory
provided good surface visibility across most of the impact area. The shovel tests
excavated, ranging in depth from 10 to 32 cm below the surface, encountered hard
dark gray clay loam with siliceous gravels (Figure 4b). Some of this gravel may have
resulted from the construction of the SAWS water tank, as push-piles of gravels are
present east of the tank in the vicinity of Shovel Test EG4 (see Figure 2).
RECOMMENDATIONS
No prehistoric or historic archeological sites were discovered by an intensive
survey of the proposed new bicycle park within Pearsall Park. Hence, Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., recommends that no additional archeological investigation is
warranted before construction.
