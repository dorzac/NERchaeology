ABSTRACT

Between February and August 2009, archaeologists from Statistical Research, Inc. (SRI), conducted a
cultural resources survey of 5,000 acres in the Southern Maneuver Areas (Maneuver Areas 1A and 1B),
Fort Bliss Military Reservation, El Paso County, Texas. The project area is located within the Hueco Bolson,
in an area of mesquite-stabilized coppice dunes and interdunal areas that often have exposures of Holocene
soils partially concealed by recent blowsands. There are also several small fault-trough basins within the
project area.
SRI conducted the survey using the Fort Bliss Transect Recording Unit (TRU) survey and site-recording system to allow for all fieldwork. This system provided the data for implementing National Register of Historic Placesâ (NRHP-) evaluation procedures and the development of eligibility recommendations for each archaeological site in the project area. The TRU methodology required developing a custom program application for collecting digital data in each positive TRU. Two primary aspects comprised
this data-collection method: the provenience designation (PD) system and the Field Information Digital
Organizer (FIDO) system. A total of 89,920 TRUs were surveyed, and 4,555 contained artifacts or features. Sites were defined based on the TRU data, resulting in definition of 99 sites, 44 of which were previously recorded and 55 of which are newly defined. Of these 99 sites, 19 (FB 6273 [41EP1892], FB
6754 [41EP1852], FB 6773 [41EP1638], FB 6774 [41EP1867], FB 6776 [41EP1645], FB 6778 [41EP
1925], FB 6816 [41EP1953], FB 6829 [41EP1640], FB 6837 [41EP1887], FB 6839 [41EP1898], FB 6842
[41EP1934], FB 7721 [41EP1966], FB 7928 [41EP1593], FB 7938 [41EP1868], FB 7939 [41EP1856],
FB 7946 [41EP1886], FB 9711 [41EP2651], FB 9807 [41EP2743], and FB 19359 [41EP6247]) are recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP. Only one of these (FB 19359) is among the newly discovered
sites. The sites recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP are among the largest sites in the project area and typically have numerous features preserved in the buried Holocene soils in some interdunal areas.
The remaining 80 sites are recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

Introduction
A. C. MacWilliams and Kari M. Schmidt

This document presents the results of survey and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) evaluation
of sites within 5,000 acres located in Maneuver Areas (MAs) 1A and 1B in the Southern Maneuver Areas
at Fort Bliss (Figure 1). The project area is located within the Hueco Bolson, characterized by extensive
dunal sands and intact aeolian sand sheets, with numerous small, mesquite-stabilized coppice dunes, aeolian sand sheets, and interdunal areas that often have exposed Holocene soils containing cultural materials. Fieldwork for the project was conducted between February and August of 2009.
This report is submitted by Statistical Research, Inc. (SRI), to the Fort Bliss Directorate of Public Works,
Environmental Division, Conservation Branch (DPW-E), Fort Bliss, Texas, in response to Contract
No. W911SG-07-D-0012, Delivery Order No. 0011 (Fort Bliss Project No. 08-51), incorporating all
modifications to date. The contract was awarded to SRI on August 29, 2008. The project Plan of Work
(POW) for Delivery Order No. 0011 (Vierra et al. 2008) presents the plan for archaeological survey and
NRHP evaluation of 5,000 acres located in the Southern Maneuver Areas, Fort Bliss Military Reservation, El Paso County, Texas. SRIâs Accident Prevention Plan of 2008 applied to the work conducted as
part of this project.
As one of the nationâs foremost military training facilities, Fort Bliss is essential for developing and
maintaining the combat readiness of the United States Armed Forces. In conjunction with facilitating
the United States Armyâs (Armyâs) mission of readiness training, the Garrison Commander is responsible for
coordinating with the Fort Bliss Historic Preservation Officer (HPO) to ensure the proper management
of historic properties. Several different laws, regulations, and standards define the Armyâs responsibility
to identify and manage the diverse cultural resources on Fort Bliss. These laws and regulations include,
but are not limited to, the following:
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢

National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended
Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) of 1979, as amended
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990 and
Army Regulation 200-1, Environmental Protection and Enhancement

Cultural-resource-stewardship efforts at Fort Bliss are centered on two documents, the Programmatic Agreement (PA) and the Integrated Cultural Resource Management Plan (ICRMP). Together, these documents
define and provide the explicit context and procedures for the identification, management, and ultimate
disposition of historic properties at Fort Bliss. The explicit criteria and historic and environmental contexts
for determining if a prehistoric property on Fort Bliss is eligible for listing in the NRHP are presented in
the Significance Standards of Prehistoric Archeological Sites at Fort Bliss (Abbott et al. 1996) and the
Significance and Research Standards for Prehistoric Archeological Sites at Fort Bliss (Miller, Kenmotsu,
et al. 2009).
The current project had three primary goals: the accurate identification and characterization of all prehistoric and historical-period cultural manifestations present in the 5,000-acre survey area (including those
previously defined), the accurate documentation of the composition and spatial associations of these manifestations, and the provision of explicit (eligible or not eligible) NRHP recommendations to the Fort Bliss

Historic Preservation Office (HPO) for any identified archaeological sites. The survey and evaluation
program for determining NRHP eligibility that SRI presented in the POW and re-presents in this document
explicitly follows cultural resource management (CRM) Standard Operating Procedure No. 4 as outlined
in the PA (as amended March 2008) and draws heavily from the significance-standards documents (Abbott
et al. 1996; Miller, Kenmotsu, et al. 2009). In the POW, Vierra et al. (2008) defined a number of overarching
and interrelated tasks. In general, these tasks can be distilled into four processes: project initiation, documentation, analyses/synthesis, and recommendations. This document provides an explicit framework for
these four processes and presents the research goals, data, methods, and NRHP recommendations.
Survey was conducted using the Fort Bliss Transect Recording Unit (TRU) survey and site-recording
system to allow for the implementation of NRHP-evaluation procedures and the development of eligibility
recommendations for each archaeological site in the project area. Two primary aspects composed the datacollection methodology implemented by SRI: the provenience-designation (PD) system and the Field
Information Digital Organizer (FIDO) system. The survey area was composed of one large, contiguous
parcel (see Figure 1). A total of 89,920 TRUs were surveyed, and 4,555 contained artifacts or features.
As a result of the survey, 99 archaeological sites were identified and documented. Of this total, 55 sites
were newly recorded, and 44 were previously recorded and documented by preceding projects and updated
by the current project. Nineteen are recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP (FB 6273 [41EP1892],
FB 6754 [41EP1852], FB 6773 [41EP1638], FB 6774 [41EP1867], FB 6776 [41EP1645], FB 6778 [41EP
1925], FB 6816 [41EP1953], FB 6829 [41EP1640], FB 6837 [41EP1887], FB 6839 [41EP1898], FB 6842
[41EP1934], FB 7721 [41EP1966], FB 7928 [41EP1593], FB 7938 [41EP1868], FB 7939 [41EP1856],
FB 7946 [41EP1886], FB 9711 [41EP2651], FB 9807 [41EP2743], and FB 19359 [41EP6247]), all under
criterion d; the remaining 80 sites are recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP. All of the sites
date entirely or primarily to the prehistoric period.
This report is organized into 11 chapters and 7 appendixes. Chapters 1â6 provide background data,
the research design, and field methods. Chapter 7 presents the results of the survey, focusing in particular
on providing cultural resource descriptions and bases for recommendations. Chapter 8 details the results
of spatial analyses. Chapter 9 addresses the project research issues, and Chapters 10 and 11 provide eligibility
recommendations and concluding discussion. The appendixes provide locational data for sites, artifacts,
and features. Site-location maps are provided on 1:24,000-scale topographic maps in Appendix A. Appendix B provides Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates for each site. Features identified in
nonsite TRUs are listed in Appendix C, and nonsite artifacts are listed in Appendix D. Collected artifacts
are listed in Appendix E. TRU artifact and feature attributes are listed in Appendix F, and the full analyses
conducted on collected projectile points are presented in Appendix G.

Introduction
This chapter characterizes the modern environment of the 5,000-acre-survey project area, located in the
Southern Maneuver Areas of Fort Bliss, and summarizes the historical development of the natural environment in the vicinity of Fort Bliss. These discussions provide information on the overall structure of the
project area, paying particular attention to the physiography, geomorphology, hydrology, climate, and
plant and animal communities, all of which were contributing factors to settlement location in the area.
Although the focus of this chapter is on the immediate project area, more-detailed information for the
greater Fort Bliss area can be found in Abbott et al. (1996).

Bedrock Geology, Soils, and Physiography
The project area is located on the floor of the Hueco Bolson, which is contained within the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin and Range Province. The Mexican Highlands section is a transitional zone between the Sonoran Desert to the south and the Colorado Plateau to the north. The Basin and Range Province,
characterized as a series of narrow, subparallel, northâsouth- or northwestâsoutheast-trending mountain
ranges and intervening broad, interiorly drained basins, or bolsons (Church et al. 1996; Hawley and Kottlowski 1969; Kottlowski 1958), extends more or less in an arc from Trans-Pecos Texas, southern New
Mexico, and northern Chihuahua, westward into Arizona and southeastern California, and then northward
through western Nevada into southern Oregon and Idaho (Abbott et al. 1996).
Mountain ranges surrounding the Tularosa Basin and Hueco Bolson have compositions that are highly
variable. In general, the surrounding mountain ranges are composed of faulted beds of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian limestones, shales, and sandstones, which include intruded monzonites, rhyolites,
and other igneous materials. The Franklin, Organ, and Jarilla Mountains contain a higher degree of igneous
and metamorphic materials than the San Andres, Sacramento, and Hueco Mountains, which are primarily
composed of sedimentary materials (Church et al. 1996).
Rock formations that outcrop within the boundaries of the project area are Precambrian through Tertiary
in age (Figure 2). Precambrian formations are basement lithologies that consist of granite, gabbro, diabase,
rhyolite porphyry, and metasedimentary rocks exposed along the western face of the Sacramento Mountains.
Subsurface formations of Ordovician and Silurian rocks primarily consist of dolomites that outcrop in uplifted blocks in the Sacramento and Hueco Mountains. Pennsylvanian limestones, shales, and sandstones
outcrop extensively in the Sacramento and Hueco Mountains, in addition to isolated outcrops that exist in
the southern portion of McGregor Range (Broadhead 2003). Permian carbonates, shales, and sandstones
blanket the Otero platform and outcrop over large portions of this landform and in the Hueco and Sacramento Mountains. Tertiary-age outcroppings that consist of intrusive stocks, dikes, and sills are found in

(Broadhead 2003).

the Hueco, Jarilla, and Sacramento Mountains, and these igneous stocks form the cores of the Hueco and
Jarilla Mountains (Broadhead 2003).
The genesis of the Basin and Range landscape began with widespread deformation of Precambrian
and Paleozoic basement rocks associated with Rocky Mountain orogenic processes during the late Pennsylvanian or early Permian period (Noyes and Schmader 1988; Stewart 1978). Sustained periods of highangle extensional faulting continued throughout the Tertiary period. These episodes resulted in the distinctive fault-block structure of the Basin and Range Province, with additional local and regional deformation that continued well into the Quaternary (Morrison et al. 1981).
The Pedernal Uplift resulted in the creation of the Sacramento Mountains and Otero Mesa, and the San
Andres Uplift resulted in the formation of the San Andres and Organ Mountains (Hawley and Kottlowski
1969). As the Pedernal and San Andres fault blocks uplifted, fault blocks underlying Tularosa Basin and
Hueco Bolson subsided, resulting in down-dropped grabens (Figure 3). The newly formed graben basins
were subsequently infilled with accumulations of unconsolidated sediments from the slopes of the adjacent
mountains. These deposits reportedly attain a maximum thickness of 2,700 m in the deepest parts of the
Tularosa Basin and exceed 1,500 m in the Hueco Bolson (Healy et al. 1978; Mattick 1967; Strain 1966).
The Otero Platform is a broad, uplifted area that composes the majority of the McGregor Range. This
landform is bordered by the Tularosa Basin on the west, the Sacramento Mountains on the north, the Hueco
Mountains on the southwest, and the Salt Basin graben on the east. The southern extension of the Otero
Platform in Texas is referred to as the Diablo Platform (Broadhead 2003). The structural composition of
the Otero Platform consists of Laramide folds and northeast-vergent Laramide thrust faults that are superimposed over large-scale faulting that occurred during the Pennsylvanian through the early Permian era.
These large-scale faulting activities are characterized by horst and graben blocks bounded by high-angle
northânorthwestern-trending faults overlain by early to middle Permian strata (Broadhead 2003). The Permian
strata at the surface of the Otero Platform are echelon systems of northânorthwest-trending anticlines and
synclines (Black 1973, 1976). The formation of these folds resulted during the Laramide compression and
may also be attributed to post-Laramide movement (Black 1973, 1976). Permian exposures of the San
Andres Formation dominate the surface of the Otero Platform (Black 1973:1). This formation is absent
along the escarpment of Otero Mesa, but it becomes more prevalent toward the east end of the platform and
composes the entire surface of the Chert Plateau. Outcroppings of the Abo and Yeso Formations are exposed
along the Otero escarpment that runs through the eastern portion of McGregor Range (Church et al. 1996).
Sometime between 1 and 2 million years ago, the ancestral Rio Grande was diverted to the east from
the Rio Grande Rift into the southern portion of the Tularosa Basin and Hueco Bolson through Fillmore
Pass, located between the Franklin and Organ Mountains (Church 2000; Church et al. 1996). Exotic mixed
gravels of the Santa Fe Formation, including high-quality chert, quartzite, and obsidian, were fluvially deposited in the Tularosa Basin and Hueco Bolson during this period of channel displacement (Ruhe 1967). The
Santa Fe Formation presently outcrops in a fault scarp on the east side of Fillmore Pass (Carmichael 1986).
In the Tularosa Basin and Hueco Bolson, these gravels include the Fort Hancock and Camp Rice Formations (Church et al. 1996). A series of large and small saline lakes partially covered the Tularosa Basin
throughout the Tertiary and Quaternary periods. The Fort Hancock Formation is associated with low-energy
lacustrine-sediment deposition that included intervals of slow desiccation (Strain 1966). In contrast, the
Camp Rice Formation is associated with a high-energy fluvial depositional environment triggered by major
climatic changes responsible for the redeposition of local materials, such as obsidian and exotic cherts at
lower-latitude channel floodplains of the ancestral Rio Grande (Church 2000; Church et al. 1996). The
Camp Rice Formation is composed of six sharp-based sandstone units and a single siltstone unit, capped
by a layer of caliche that averages 2 m in thickness. The upper portion of the Camp Rice Formation is
referred to as the La Mesa geomorphic surface (Gile et al. 1981; Monger 1993). Sediments associated
with this surface consist of sands, gravels, and muds that are totally or partially cemented with Stage IV
and V carbonates (Monger 1993).
A number of stratigraphic units dating from the middle to late Pleistocene through the Holocene are
underlain by the La Mesa surface around the margins and on the floor of the Tularosa Basin. These upper

7

stratigraphic units are characterized by deposits associated with piedmont slopes, localized alluvial fans at
the mouths of intermittent lateral drainages, undulating dunes, and playas (Anschuetz et al. 1990:5).
Jornada I and II deposits are associated with middle and late Pleistocene fan-piedmont depositional
environments. These deposits grade toward the basin from the basin-floor margin and become reworked
or welded onto the La Mesa surface (Buck et al. 1999). The late Pleistocene Petts Tank stratigraphic unit
consists of fine-grained alluvial/lacustrine sediments associated with closed depressions on the basin floor.
Isaackâs Ranch sediments include alluvial-fan and aeolian lithofacies deposited during the late Pleistocene
(Machette 1985; Monger 1993). This unit is dominated by aeolian sand-sheet deposits and widely scattered
lag materials unconformably distributed over the La Mesa geomorphic surface. Late Pleistocene and
Holocene Lake Tank deposits also consist of fine-grained alluvial/lacustrine sediments associated with
closed basin-floor depressions (Monger 1993).
Major alluvial fans developed off the mountains around the onset of the Holocene, when a climatic shift
began a gradual reduction in grass cover and triggered the development of dune fields in the basin (Monger
and Buck 1997). Sustained periods of aridity resulted in numerous episodes of aeolian deposition and
deflationary activity that caused unconformably distributed sediment accretions, as well as exposures of
earlier Pleistocene and Holocene stratigraphic units. A number of these aeolian depositional episodes that
spanned the Holocene were followed by successive periods of landscape stability and soil formation. The
Holocene Organ stratigraphic unit is primarily associated with fan-piedmont depositional environments in
the Tularosa Basin, having a more limited association with aeolian dune deposits on the basin floor (Monger
1993; Ruhe 1964, 1967). This unit is subdivided into three distinct episodes of deposition (Organ I, II, and
III) that are evident in the stratigraphic record of the Organ aeolian lithofacies. These sediment deposits are
represented by sand-sheet deposits underlain by the Isaackâs Ranch and/or La Mesa surfaces. The episodes
of Organ aeolian deposition are 7,000â2,100 years B.P. (Organ I), 2,100â1,100 years B.P. (Organ II), and
1100â100 B.P. (Organ III) (Gile et al. 1981; Monger 1993).
Historical-period dunes and sand sheets within the last ca. 150 years overlie the Organ aeolian sediments. These sediment deposits consist of coppice dunes, sand sheets, and interdunal deflationary surfaces intermixed with numerous shallow depressions, or playas, that are widespread throughout the basin
floor. This depositional environment presently characterizes the landscape of the project area. These
historical-period sand-dune deposits consist of massive or planar-laminated fine sand that forms around
patches of vegetation, such as mesquite, fourwing saltbush, and yucca. Recent pedogenic activity is not
evident in these historical-period aeolian deposits. The rather dynamic aeolian environment in the basin
8

has resulted in the exposure of numerous Holocene stratigraphic units and associated prehistoric cultural
manifestations due to deflationary activity.
Although the Organ soil chronostratigraphic sequence was initially developed for alluvial-fan deposits
in the Tularosa Basin, it has since been expanded to correlate with aeolian facies and fans on the basin
floor (Monger 1993). Some researchers suggest that the physical correlation between the originally modeled
fan deposits and basin aeolian landforms has been problematic (Hall 1999, 2003). The Q1âQ4 model
was specifically developed for aeolian basin-floor depositional environments (Blair et al. 1990; Gile et al.
1981). Consequently, the structure of this model incorporates most of the archaeologically significant
Holocene deposits into a single stratigraphic unit consisting of the Q3 (ca. 7,000â100 years B.P.). The Q1
stratigraphic unit consists of a truncated petrocalcic K horizon that is temporally analogous to the La Mesa
calcrete (ca. 250,000â50,000 years B.P.) cemented with Stage IIIâIV carbonates. Unit Q2 is characterized
by buried Btk, Bk, or Btk-Bk horizons with Stage II carbonates, which is equivalent to the Isaackâs Ranch
unit (15,000â9,000 years B.P.). In the Tularosa Basin, the Q3 unit encompasses the Organ unit, which
consists of weakly developed soils that exhibit buried A-Bw-C or A-Bk-C profiles with Stage I carbonates
(Blair et al. 1990). Lastly, Q4 deposits apply to historical-period aeolian coppice dunes and sand sheets
deposited on the floor of the basin within the last ca. 150 years.
The modern landscape surrounding the project area is characterized by a number of principal landform units (Figure 4). The upland unit includes the steep, rocky terrain of the Sacramento, Hueco, and
Organ Mountains, with additional broken terrain located at the edge of the Otero Mesa escarpment. The
Otero Mesa unit consists of a gently sloping mesa surface bordered by rugged mountains. The steeper,
higher-elevation fans and erosional slopes of the Otero escarpment make up the proximal-medial alluvialfan unit. The lowest portions of the basin are included in the Basin-Floor Distal Alluvial Fan unit that consists of the level basin floor and gently sloping bajadas. Numerous small, playa-like depressions are scattered across the basin floor (Abbott et al. 1996). The playa depressions serve as important water-catchment
areas. Elevations of the mountain and basin landforms on Fort Bliss range from 3,900 feet (1,200 m) on
the basin floor to 8,829 feet (2,690 m) in the Organ Mountains.
The project area is located in the Basin-Floor Distal Alluvial Fan unit. The distribution of surface soils
within the immediate project area is characterized by a number of soil units, including Mcnew sandy loam,
the Elizario-Copia complex, the Foxtrot-Copia complex, Hueco loamy fine sand, the Mcnew-Copia-Foxtrot complex, the Mcnew-Copia complex, and the Wessly-Copia complex (Figure 5).
The Hueco loamy fine sand unit is characterized by a profile consisting of 12 cm of loamy fine sand
overlying 63 cm of fine sandy loam underlain by a petrocalcic K horizon approximately 10 cm in thickness. Stratigraphically underlying the K horizon is roughly 140 cm of loam. Hueco loamy fine sands are
generally distributed on alluvial flats with 1â3 percent slopes. The parent material of this soil unit consists
of aeolian sands underlain by alluvium.
Copia soils are typically characterized by a profile consisting of approximately 200 cm of loamy fine
sand distributed on coppice dunes and hillslopes with 2â5 percent slopes. The parent material of this soil
is composed of aeolian sands. Soils associated with the Mcnew sandy loam unit are characterized by a profile consisting of 7.5 cm of sandy loam underlain by roughly 105 cm of sandy clay loam. This soil unit is
generally distributed on alluvial flats with 2â5 percent slopes. The parent material of Mcnew soils consists
of aeolian sands underlain by alluvium.
Soils within the Foxtrot unit are characterized by a typical profile consisting of 2.5 cm of sand underlain by 200 cm of sandy clay loam distributed on alluvial flats with 2â5 percent slopes. The parent material of Foxtrot soils is composed of aeolian sands underlain by alluvium. Wessly soils are typically characterized by a profile consisting of roughly 203 cm of sandy clay loam distributed on alluvial flats with
1â3 percent slopes. The parent material of this soil consists of alluvium. Elizario soils are typically characterized by a profile consisting of 5 cm of sand overlying 45 cm of sandy clay loam underlain by approximately 76 cm of silt loam. This soil unit is generally distributed within depressions or on alluvial flats with
2â5 percent slopes. The parent material of Elizario soils consists of aeolian sands underlain by alluvium.
All of the soil units within the project area are generally distributed at elevations ranging between 1,188
and 1,280 m.

Paleoenvironmental Conditions
Environmental conditions undoubtedly affected the prehistoric peoples who encountered them. Martin
and Plog (1973) discuss the limitations of techniques and data used to understand prehistoric environmental
variables and stress the importance of using geomorphological, palynological, paleontological, and dendrochronological data (when possible) for reconstructing paleoecological conditions. A comprehensive
database exists for geomorphological, palynological, and paleontological data in the desert borderland
region (Betancourt et al. 1990; Davis and Anderson 1987; Elias 1987; Holmgren 2005; Holmgren et al.
2003; Van Devender and Toolin 1983; Van Devender et al. 1984), but dendrochronological data are
more limited, although Grissino-Mayer et al. (1997) have compiled a regional reconstruction for precipitation in southern and central New Mexico. Using these databases, informed statements can be made
about how, and to what extent, the environment of the desert borderland region has been altered and when
and how the modern grassland and desertscrub communities were established.
The semidesert grassland community has been the dominant biome in the desert borderland region for
thousands of years (see Van Devender 1995 for an extended discussion). Grassland formation in the region
has a long and complex history, the last 12,000 years of which are significant to this project. Though the
grasslands developed over millions of years, the onset and subsequent retreat of late Pleistocene glaciers
form a point of departure for discussing these conditions. Research on geomorphological, palynological,
and dendrochronological data in the southern United States has helped researchers understand how
environmental conditions have changed through time in the arid region.
Although the project area was distant from the massive glaciers that covered much of the northern portion
of the continent at the end of the Pleistocene, it did not escape their effects completely. Most significant
for this area was the expansion of woodland biomes into what are now desertscrub communities (Van
Devender 1995). This expansion, however, did not affect the most resilient of the desert grasses that had
been present for millions of years. Palynological samples from the late Pleistocene are dominated by woodland
species including piÃ±on (Pinus edulis and Pinus remota), juniper (Juniperus sp.), and shrub oak (Quercus
pungens) (Van Devender et al. 1990). The samples also show the presence of various grasses, including
grama (Bouteloua sp.) and dropseed (Sporobolus sp.), and of fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) and
prickly pear (Opuntia sp.). Along with these plant species, several vertebrate species were present, including a
large number of rodents. These data suggest that grasslands have been present in the desert borderland
region since before the Pleistocene but that the biotic communities found in the area today were established
after the last glacial maximum.
Of course, the Pleistocene epoch had several implications for the grasslands of the desert borderlands.
After the retreat of the glaciers, warmer and drier conditions prevailed. Woodland species retreated to
higher elevations, and grassland species increased in abundance at all elevations. In the northern Chihuahuan
Desert (including west Texas and south-central New Mexico), the vegetation shifted from piÃ±on-juniperoak woodland about 11,000 years ago to desert grassland by 8,500 years ago (Van Devender 1990). The
grasslands spread across the landscape, and it was during the Altithermal period (Antevs 1955) from 8,500 to
4,000 years ago that grasslands actually achieved their greatest development (Van Devender 1995). Thus,
the pollen and macrofossil records (Martin 1963; Van Devender 1995) indicate that the desert grasslands
were most widespread during the middle Holocene and have remained much as they are today for only
the last 3,500â4,000 years. Environmental fluctuations certainly have occurred in the desert borderland
region (and by extension, the project area), but these seem to be events that may have been short-lived
and areally concentrated.
An example of these fluctuations is evident in the faunal assemblage from Howellâs Ridge Cave in
southern Grant County, New Mexico (Van Devender and Worthington 1977). Howellâs Ridge Cave
contained a 12,000-year-old stratified paleontological vertebrate fauna that was deposited primarily by
raptors. The cave produced a large sample (n = 2,567) of bones and provided an opportunity to investigate
how the immediate habitat, and those nearby, changed through time. In addition to the well-documented
Pleistocene extinctions, this assemblage documents three fluctuations within the last 4,000 years (Van
Devender and Worthington 1977). Although the same desert grassland species have dominated the biome
12

throughout the Holocene, the paleontological deposit indicates the surrounding playa lake contained perennial
water from 12,000 to 4,000 years ago, and again from 3,000 to 1,000 years ago (Van Devender 1995; Van
Devender and Worthington 1977). These changes, although not monumental biotic changes, likely produced
fluctuations in the relative abundances of the biota in the area surrounding the cave and in the region
in general.
The decline of grassland vertebrate species in Howellâs Ridge Cave 4,000 years ago reflects the first
increase of shrubs in the Holocene desert grassland community. The increase of shrubby species between
4,000 and 3,000 years ago reflects a shift to more-xeric habitats with more exposed soil between shrubs.
A similar increase in shrubby species occurred again at approximately 1,000 years ago, when significant
population movements were occurring across the desert borderland region. The paleontological fauna
examined at Howellâs Ridge Cave in southwestern New Mexico suggests that on at least two occasions,
shifts to more-xeric, shrub-dominated conditions in the borderland region, as evidenced by an increase in
grassland vertebrate taxa, coincided with significant cultural and social changes.
Research shows that the desert grassland was well watered and well developed by 4,000 years ago, producing more-mesic conditions for about 1,000 years (Holmgren 2005; Holmgren et al. 2003). During this
1,000-year period, desert species (both flora and fauna) decreased as grassland species increased. Beginning
around 3,000 years ago, more-xeric conditions were established across the borderland region, and desert
species began to increase and once again dominated the grassland biome. This trend continued virtually
uninterrupted, with the exception of a short period just prior to 1,000 years ago, when precipitation increased
briefly and playas in the desert borderlands consistently held water. Since that time, drier conditions have
dominated the U.S. Southwest and northern Mexico. The well-documented shrub increase in desert grasslands in the last 150â200 years (Bahre 1991, 1995) may have been a natural response to drought conditions,
similar to those seen from 4,000 to 3,000 years ago and between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, those differing
only by the unprecedented Euro-American ranching and agricultural activities. At Howellâs Ridge Cave
in southwestern New Mexico, increases in the number of desert species at 3,900, 2,500, and 1,000 years
B.P. suggest more-open habitats with an increased number of shrubs and succulents (Van Devender 1995).
The increases seem to be natural occurrences documented in the paleontological and palynological records
with the historical-period expansion of shrubs intensified by grazing. As such, the conditions found in the
desert borderland region today resemble those found prehistorically, but they seem to have been exacerbated
by modern ranching activities (Hastings and Turner 1965; Turner et al. 2003).
The palynological and paleontological data are supported by extensive regional precipitation data
presented by Grissino-Mayer et al. (1997). They have developed a detailed, high-resolution, millenniallength reconstruction of precipitation for the southern New Mexico/Rio Grande Basin area, with particular
reference to Fort Bliss, White Sands Missile Range, and Holloman Air Force Base. Grissino-Mayer et al.
(1997) targeted specific sites from several locations in the Sacramento, Magdalena, San Mateo, and Organ
Mountains, and they primarily sampled ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii), southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis), and Colorado piÃ±on (Pinus edulis). They also
used previously collected tree-ring material excavated from archeological sites of varying age located
throughout the target area.
The reconstruction developed by Grissino-Mayer et al. (1997) revealed that the most-severe longterm drought during the last 1,373 years in southern and central New Mexico occurred between A.D. 940
and 1040, with the most-severe drought conditions occurring between A.D. 995 and 1005 (Table 1). The
long-term drought that occurred between A.D. 940 and 1040 was followed by the wettest long-term period
in the region, which occurred between A.D. 1040 and 1210. The wettest portion of this time span occurred
between A.D. 1065 and 1105 (Table 2). The first two decades of the 1100s represented the wettest shortterm period (less than 25 years) in the entire reconstruction (see Table 2). Rainfall was very reliable and
did not vary greatly from year to year (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:57). Between A.D. 1125 and 1140, a
short-term, but very severe, drought occurred that interrupted this period of favorable rainfall (GrissinoMayer et al. 1997:52). After this 16-year drought, rainfall returned to above-average conditions, which
lasted until around A.D. 1210.

Magnitude measures the average precipitation per year for the specified period. These values can be
compared to the average of 9.34 inches total precipitation per year between A.D. 622 and 1994.

Following this lengthy wet period, a second major long-term drought period occurred between A.D. 1210
and 1305, a century that culminated in the worst decades-long drought during the last 1,373 years (based
on both magnitude and duration), between A.D. 1270 and 1295. This drought is known in the Four Corners
region as the âGreat Droughtâ and is believed to have been a primary factor in the abandonment of major
Ancestral Pueblo sites (e.g., Chaco Canyon) (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:4). The findings of GrissinoMayer et al. (1997)revealed that this drought was also prominent in the southern portions of the Southwest
and could have impacted the cultural patterns of the Mogollon culture.
An important feature of this precipitation reconstruction is the changing variability of year-to-year precipitation over time. The period between A.D. 900 and 1300 was marked by unusual swings between extremely
wet periods and very dry periods in the Southwest, each often lasting well over 100 years. This pattern
changed beginning around A.D. 1300, when such wide, long-term swings diminished in their frequency
and magnitude.

Climate
The modern climate of the Fort Bliss area varies from semiarid in the highest areas of the post (e.g., in the
Sacramento and Organ Mountains) to arid in the Tularosa Basin and Hueco Bolson. The project area lies
in the Chihuahuan Desert (Figure 6) and experiences a single, unimodal, monsoonal rainfall pattern that
annually averages 320 mm (12.60 inches) (Brown 1994). The Chihuahuan Desert consists primarily of
the Chihuahuan semidesert grassland and desertscrub biotic communities, with hot summers, cool winters,
and low humidity; extreme temperatures and inconsistent precipitation are common. The project area is
in the Chihuahuan desertscrub biome and is adjacent to both the Plains grassland and semidesert grassland
biotic communities (Shreve 1942). The fluctuations between summer and winter temperatures are large in
the Chihuahuan Desert, where snowfall is common in winter months into southern Chihuahua and northern
Durango (Brown 1994).
Although the Chihuahuan Desert region extends farther south than other North American deserts, extensive portions lie above 1,219 m (4,000 feet) in elevation. The lowest portions of the Chihuahuan Desert
region are about 305 m (1,000 feet) in elevation along the Rio Grande, and the highest portions, in Mexico,
approach 3,048 m (10,000 feet) in elevation. Areas in west Texas and southern New Mexico average about
1,069 m (3,500 feet) in elevation.
Temperature typically exhibits large diurnal and annual variability. Near El Paso, which is at the
southern end of the military installation, the mean high temperature, in July, is 94ÂºF (34ÂºC), and the mean
low temperature, in January, is 32ÂºF (0ÂºC). At Alamogordo, New Mexico, which is on the northern end of
the post, the mean high temperature, in July, is 95ÂºF (35ÂºC), and the mean low temperature, in January, is
27ÂºF (-3ÂºC). Both of these locations have at least 1 day above 105ÂºF (41ÂºC) in the summer and below 10ÂºF
(-12ÂºC) in the winter, and the typical diurnal variation is approximately 26â29ÂºF (14â16ÂºC) during the
winter and 24â30ÂºF (13â17ÂºC) in the summer. Winters in the Chihuahuan Desert are cool, especially in the
northern reaches, where nighttime temperatures drop below freezing on average over 100 times per year
(Brown 1994). In the summer, daytime high temperatures have reached a reported 122ÂºF (50Â°C), and the dry
early-summer months of May and June are typically the hottest part of the year in the Chihuahuan Desert

15

Figure 6. Map of the Chihuahuan Desert.

(Brown 1994). Relative humidity in the area is quite low, averaging from 10 to 14 percent during the
winter and spring and from 22 to 24 percent in the fall months (Ruffner and Blair 1987).
The Chihuahuan Desert is dry because it is surrounded by Mexicoâs two great mountain ranges, the
Sierra Madre Oriental and Occidental. As warm, moist air rises to move across these mountains, it cools
rapidly and produces rainfall. The result is that most of the moisture has been removed from these air
masses before they ever reach the basins of the Chihuahuan Desert. Although the other North American
deserts each have a summer and winter rainy season (because of their location farther to the west), rain
typically comes to the Chihuahuan Desert only from July to October. As much as 90 percent of the annual
rainfall takes place during this period, typically in the form of afternoon thunderstorms that originate over
the Gulf of Mexico. Most of this precipitation falls so rapidly that it cannot effectively infiltrate, and brief,
high-energy runoff is common in the project area.
Average annual precipitation in the El Paso area is less than 8 inches (195 mm), and it rises to 10 inches
(254 mm) around Alamogordo, New Mexico. Measurable snowfall occurs in the basin occasionally but
rarely exceeds 2 inches or lasts more than 24 hours on the ground. In the higher mountains, annual precipitation increases to between 12 and 18 inches, and more of this falls as snow during the winter (Brown
1994). A review of regional tree-ring data from approximately A.D. 620 shows that prolonged droughts
have occurred in the region at or around A.D. 700, A.D. 1000, A.D. 1270, and A.D. 1580 (Grissino-Mayer
et al. 1997:53). Minor droughts have also been identified at A.D. 1450, A.D. 1640, A.D. 1730, A.D. 1880,
and in the early 1970s (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997).
Winds from the north, west, and south are common in the project area, but the strongest winds originate
almost entirely from the southwest and west and are most common during the spring. Relatively strong winds
often come with cold fronts or frontal storm lines that move across the mountains.

Flora within the Survey Area
Cursory field observations of local vegetation structure were made over the course of the survey fieldwork.
The most common taxa in the project area are listed in Table 3. The project area is situated within the Hueco
Bolson, in an area characterized by extensive dunal sands and intact aeolian sand sheets with numerous
small, mesquite-stabilized coppice dunes surrounding interdunal deflation areas and catchment basins. The
study area is located in the Chihuahuan Desert, which supports approximately 3,500 plant species. Estimates
of endemism reach up to 1,000 endemic species (29 percent) and at least 16 endemic plant genera (Olson and
Dinerstein 1998; Toledo 1988). Recent classifications regard vegetation communities in and around the
study area as Chihuahuan desertscrub (Brown 1994; Dick-Peddie 1993; Muldavin et al. 2000).
Vegetation zones in the project area closely correspond to underlying geology, aspect/exposure, soil
composition/depth, and proximity to seasonally banked moisture, but it is difficult to delineate individual
belts/zones/communities in a truly definitive sense. Anthropogenic activity has deeply influenced the prevailing vegetation, and at the practical level, it is almost impossible to distinguish whether an area is
dominated by semipristine or disclimax communities (Brown 1982). Regardless, the biotic communities on Fort Bliss have been broken down into more-fine-grained vegetation zones, defined primarily based
on the presence and/or prominence of particular plant taxa (Figure 7). Only a few of these zones are
present within the project survey area (Basin Desert Lowland Shrub, Basin Desert Shrubland [coppice dunes],
Mesa Grassland, and Sandy Plains Desert Grassland), and all of the archaeological sites are found in the
Basin Desert Shrubland (coppice dunes) zone. This zone is characterized by the formation of mesquitestabilized coppice dunes.

Fauna
As with the floral species, the Chihuahuan desertscrub biotic community supports a diverse array of animal
species (Table 4) (Brown 1994). Many of these species have adapted to scarce and unpredictable precipitation, fluctuating temperatures, variable wind velocities, and a general lack of protective cover.
The Chihuahuan desertscrub community supports more mammals than most other major ecosystems
in the region (with the exception of the semidesert grassland community) (Parmenter and Van Devender
1995:198). Some of the well-represented mammal species are the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus); desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii); spotted ground squirrel (Spermophilus spilosoma);
hispid pocket mouse (Chaetodipus [Perognathus] hispidus); Ordâs, Banner-tailed, and Merriamâs kangaroo
rats (Dipodomys ordii, D. spectabilis, and D. merriami); white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus); cotton
rats (Sigmodon hispidus and S. fulviventer); southern plains and white-throated woodrats (Neotoma micropus
and N. albigula); ringtail (Bassariscus astutus); badger (Taxidea taxus); coyote (Canis latrans); mountain
lion (Felis concolor); javelina (Pecari [Dicotyles] tajacu); mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus); and pronghorn
(Antilocapra americana) (Anderson 1972; Parmenter and Van Devender 1995).
Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) and deer (Odocoileus sp.) are both extant within a fairly close range
of the project area, and bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are extant in the Big Hatchet, Little Hatchet,
Peloncillo, and Alamo Hueco Mountains, along the ChihuahuaâNew Mexico border. The bighorn-sheep
populations in these areas were reintroduced into the boot heel of New Mexico some 20 years ago (John R.
Roney, personal communication 2002), but these mountains are presumably part of the original range for
this species. Historically, large predators have struggled for survival in the North American deserts. The
mountain lion (Felis concolor) has been relatively successful, and gray wolves (Canis lupus) and black
bears (Ursus americanus) still remain in portions of southern New Mexico, west Texas, and northern
Mexico (MacDonald 1995).

The northern Chihuahuan Desert region, of which the project area is a part, has a rich bat and avian
fauna (Parmenter and Van Devender 1995). Most of the bats are small and insectivorous, and notable
representatives include the pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus), the western pipistrelle (Pipistrellus hesperus),
and the Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis). The variety of birds is also great in the project area
(Parmenter and Van Devender 1995), and a list of the most-prominent species includes Swainsonâs Hawk
(Buteo swainsoni), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), American kestrel (Falco sparverius), mourning dove
20

(Zenaida macroura), Gambelâs quail (Callipepla [Lophortyx] gambelii), roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), common poorwill (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii), ladder-backed woodpecker (Picoides scalaris),
western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis), ash-throated flycatcher (Myiarchus cinerascens), white-necked raven
(Corvus albicollis), and cactus wren (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus).
A number of endemic reptiles and amphibians also inhabit the region (Parmenter and Van Devender
1995), including the western yellow box turtle (Terrapene ornata luteola), desert grassland hog-nosed snake
(Heterodon nasicus kennerlyi), western hook-nosed snake (Gyalopion canum [Ficimia cana]), desert grassland whiptail (Cnemidophorus uniparens), southwestern earless lizard (Cophosaurus texanus scitulus
[Holbrookia texana scitula]), and western green toad (Bufo debilis insidior), to name some of the mostcommon representatives.
Modern ranching practices have significantly impacted the landscape of the borderland region. In the
last 150 years, the number of nonnative animals has increased, and native animals either have been extirpated
or have decreased dramatically in numbers (e.g., wolf and pronghorn). Although the last 100â150 years
have seen dramatic shrub invasion and other changes in the composition of the desertscrub biotic community,
the essential environmental conditions found in the region today remain similar to those that prehistoric
inhabitants would have experienced (Parmenter and Van Devender 1995).

CHAPTER 3

Geologic and Geomorphic Background
Jason Windingstad

Introduction
This chapter summarizes the geoarchaeological investigations carried out on August 11 and 12, 2009, in
the 5,000-acre survey-area block in MAs 1A and 1B (Figure 8). The primary objective of this research
was to identify and describe late Quaternary landforms, sedimentary deposits, and soils within the project
boundaries and to asses the geomorphic context and integrity of the cultural deposits identified during the
course of the archaeological survey.

Background
The project area is located in the fault-bound Hueco Bolson (bolsÃ³n is Spanish for handbag or purse) of
west Texas, between the Franklin Mountains on the west and the Hueco Mountains on the east. The Hueco
Bolson represents the easternmost extension of the Rio Grande Rift and is situated in the northeastern
extent of the Chihuahuan Desert in the Mexican Highlands portion of the Basin and Range physiographic
province. The Basin and Range Province makes a broad arch that extends from Trans-Pecos Texas and
southern New Mexico, westward through southern Arizona and southeastern California and northward
into Nevada, western Utah, southern Oregon and Idaho (Fenneman 1931; Thornbury 1965). The province
is characterized by parallel, northwestâsoutheast-trending, block-faulted mountain ranges separated
by basins created by high-angle extensional faulting (Hawley and Kottlowski 1969). Initial formation of
the province began during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, when Precambrian and Paleozoic
basement rocks experienced widespread deformation related to the Laramide Orogeny (formation of the
Rocky Mountains, approximately 80 million years ago [mya]) (Damon et al. 1984). Major extensional
faulting in the province began around 30â35 mya in the early Neogene and continued locally until a second
major phase began, approximately 17 mya in the Miocene. The last major episode of deformation (continental
crust was stretched, resulting in widespread normal faulting) is responsible for the classic Basin and Range
structure of high-angle block faulting that characterizes the province today (Damon et al. 1984; Eaton 1982).
The Mexican Highlands section of the province is characterized by broad, internally drained basins and
discontinuous mountain ranges that range in elevation from 1,740 to 2,747 m above mean sea level (amsl)
(5,709â9,012 feet) (Gile et al. 1981). The most-prominent landscape feature in this subprovince is the southern
extension of the northâsouth-trending Rio Grande Rift zone. The rift formed as an eastâwest extension
created by the Colorado Plateau pulling away from the High Plains, resulting in crustal thinning and
deformation that began in the southern part of the rift, approximately 36 mya (Keller and Cather 1994).
Expansion of the rift peaked around 10â16 mya but is still tectonically active. The Hueco Bolson is located
in the southern Rio Grande Rift, where it merges with the southern Basin and Range Province in TransPecos Texas.
The Hueco Bolson is a fault-bound half-graben infilled with Cenozoic lacustrine and alluvial sediments
that attain a maximum depth of 2,750 m (9,000 feet) near the west side of the basin (near the footwall of
23

the Franklin mountains) (Cliett and Hawley 1995). The Hueco Bolson fill is generally considered part of the
Santa Fe Group below recent (late Pleistocene to modern) alluvium. The Middle Santa Fe Group consists
of the silts, clays, and evaporites of the Fort Hancock formation, and the Upper Santa Fe Group is composed
of Pleistocene Rio Grande alluvium (Camp Rice Formation). The deposition of these basin-fill sediments
is related to regional tectonics along the Rio Grande Rift and glacial-climatic cycles.
Approximately 5 mya, in the late Tertiary, the bolson was internally drained and contained extensive
shallow playa lakes. By 2 mya, however, the ancestral Rio Grande cut into the Hueco Bolson between the
Franklin and Organ Mountains at Fillmore Pass, forming a system of interconnected playas. It was at this
time that the evaporite-rich Fort Hancock formation of the Middle Santa Fe Group was deposited across
the western side of the bolson (Langford 2001). Sometime in the late Pliocene (1.8 mya) and continuing
until the mid Pleistocene (approximately 0.67 mya), the ancestral Rio Grande cut through to the lower
drainage basin and discharged into the Gulf of Mexico, replacing the system of interconnected playa lakes
with through-flowing braided channels along the western edge of the basin. This network of braided channels
deposited the sand and gravel of the westward-thickening Camp Rice Formation of the upper Santa Fe
Group. Alluvial deposition continued until regional uplift caused the river to change course (approximately
0.67 mya) and flow through the narrows near El Paso rather than Fillmore pass (Druhan 2006; Langford
2001). Since this time, the Hueco Bolson has been internally drained.
Since the Hueco Bolson became internally drained in the mid Pleistocene, landscape evolution has been
dominated by climatic fluctuations, local tectonic activity, and anthropogenic processes (Buck 1996). The
upper-Pleistocene through Holocene sequence in the basin, and in the project area specifically, consists of
an aeolian sand-sheet environment imprinted over local neotectonic landscape features that include northâ
northwest-trending fault scarps and troughs (Blair et al. 1990; Machette et al. 1998). The stratigraphic
sequence in the basin contains buried and locally exhumed soils that record cyclic alterations between
unstable conditions in which erosion and sedimentation took place and stable conditions that favored soil
development. This cycle has resulted in the formation of three distinct buried soils with differing soil morphological characteristics. These soils have been dated and identified by Blair et al. (1990) as the Q4â
Q1 stratigraphic units. The Q1 unit (50k to 250k B.P.) is characterized by Btk or Bkm soil horizons with
Stage IIIâIV carbonate morphology. This soil represents the constructional top of the Camp Rice Formation (Upper Santa Fe Group) or the La Mesa geomorphic surface (Gile et al. 1981; Monger 1993). The Q1
unit has also been tentatively correlated to the Jornada II morphostratigraphic unit of the Desert Project
(Gile et al. 1981). The Q2 stratigraphic unit (9400â15,000 B.P.) is identified by Btk or Bk soil horizons
with Stage I+âII carbonate morphology and often a 5YR hue. Blair et al. (1990) assigned a tentative
age of 9400â15,000 B.P. to this unit and correlated it to the Isaackâs Ranch (>7000 B.P.) morphostratigraphic
unit of the Desert Project (Gile et al. 1981). The youngest buried soil in the basin has developed in Q3
(100â7300 B.P.) sediments. This soil is characterized by Bw or Bk horizons with Stage I carbonate
morphology. Blair et al. (1990) correlates this deposit to the Organ (100â7000 B.P.) morphostratigraphic
unit of the Desert Project (Gile et al. 1981). Monger (1993) further divides Organ deposits based on carbonate
morphology and radiocarbon dating of secondary carbonates into the Organ I (2100â7000 B.P.), II (1100â
2100 B.P.), and III (100â1100 B.P.) units. Additionally, Lukowski et al. (2003) subdivide the Q3 unit of
Blair et al. (1990), based on soil morphology and radiocarbon dating, into the Q3a (2400â7300 B.P.) and
the Q3b (100â2400 B.P.) units. Finally, the Q4 (0â100 B.P.) stratigraphic unit is characterized by recently
deposited sediments that lack recognizable soil development. The above stratigraphic units apply to all late
Pleistocene to modern sedimentary facies within the bolson (i.e., the Q3 unit can apply to aeolian, playa,
or alluvial deposits) and are considered time-stratigraphic or geochronologic units separated by bounding
surfaces (cf North American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature [NACOSN] 1983). Although soil
horizons are used to assign a relative age to these deposits, they are not related to geologic deposition.
It should be mentioned that some controversy exists surrounding the usage of Desert Project morphostratigraphic units outside of the Jornada del Muerto Basin and the Mesilla Bolson. As Hall (1999, 2003)
points out, there are a number of conceptual geological problems recognized in the usage of the Gile et al.
(1981) and Monger (1993) models in basin-floor settings (see Miller et al. 2009:Chapter 6 for a complete

25

review). Therefore, the stratigraphic units of Blair et al. (1990) and the slight modification of these units
by Lukowski et al. (2003) are referenced in this report.

Field Methods
A total of 36 auger probes in 8 transects were made across the project area (see Figure 8). Transects were
placed in areas of high site density and/or in areas of geomorphic interest within the survey block. A 5-cmdiameter-by-12-cm-long bucket auger with a 1.7-m-long extension was used during the field examinations.
The auger probes were excavated in 10-cm intervals and extended from the ground surface to a maximum
depth of 1.9 m below surface (mbs). In many instances a petrocalcic (caliche) horizon resulted in auger refusal
before attaining maximum depth. Auger locations in the report are identified according to unit PD number.
Auger probes were described using standard descriptions (Soil Survey Staff 1993; Schoeneberger
et al. 2002). Field descriptions included the following: depth below surface; horizon designation; moist and
dry Munsell color; texture; gravel content; structure; ped coatings; consistence; and secondary carbonate
accumulation. Additional notes were taken concerning the surrounding landscape, including landform type,
surface features, slope gradient, and signs of recent disturbance. Pedogenic features, such as secondary
carbonate accumulation, rubification (reddening), and clay films, along with stratigraphic relationships,
were used to estimate the relative age of the deposits (Birkeland 1999; Blair et al. 1990; Gile et al. 1981).
Intact bedding features, clast characteristics (shape, size, and orientation), and particle size were used to
make interpretations regarding depositional environments and sedimentary facies (bodies of sediment
formed in response to a particular sedimentary environment) (Boggs 1987:307).

Results
The project area consists of two broad landform types, the fault complex and the coppice-duneâdeflation
landform (see Figure 8). The majority of the project area is covered with coppice dunes and aeolian sandsheet deposits, with deflationary areas or blowouts separating individual dunes. These aeolian features are
a result of historical-period modification of the landscape (overgrazing) and are composed of Q4 sands.
Q3b (100â2400 B.P.) soils with an intact A horizon are present within some dunes. A system of highangle, normal faults that show considerable amounts of slip in the Quaternary bound the Franklin Mountains
on the west side of the Hueco Bolson. This broad anastomosing fault zone consists of numerous aeoliansand-covered scarps and northânorthwest-trending fault troughs in MAs 1A and 1B (linear, densely vegetated
areas in Figure 8). This fault system extends from 15 km northeast of White Sands, New Mexico, through
the Hueco Bolson, to the area east of Tornillo, Texas (Collins et al. 1996). Within the project area, fault
o
scarps with an average strike of 354 and a height of 2â7 m are covered in thick deposits of Q3 (100â
7300 B.P.) aeolian sand. A series of alluvial drainages and small playas subparallel to the fault scarp
have developed in the downthrown fault blocks. These depressions contain a more-complete record
of Holocene deposition.

Transect T-1
Northâsouth-trending Transect T-1 was located in the northeast corner of the project area and traverses an
area of high site density associated with a northwest-trending fault trough (see Figure 8). A total of five auger
26

probes were excavated across the transect, with an average depth to refusal of 1.27 mbs. Deflation areas
(blowouts) were connected by shallow alluvial channels that drain to the north into the fault trough.
Auger Probe A1 (PD 30502) was located on the edge of a coppice dune south of a northwestâsoutheasttrending fault trough in Transect T-1. The probe was taken to a depth of 1.4 mbs and contained a C-Bk12Bk2-3Bkmb soil-horizon sequence. The C horizon from 0 to 0.2 mbs consisted of a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6
fine sand without pedogenic structure (single grained) and with loose consistence. Underlying the C horizon, a
strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 loamy very fine sand with weak medium subangular blocky structure and early
Stage I carbonate filaments extended to a depth of 0.9 mbs. Below the Bk1 horizon, a light brown 7.5YR 6/4
loamy fine sand 2Bk2 horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure, very friable consistence,
and Stage I carbonate filaments extended from 0.9 mbs to the top of a petrocalcic horizon (3Bkmb-caliche),
at 1.4 mbs. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A1 consist of aeolian loamy fineâvery fine sand from 0 to
1.4 mbs. The level of soil development observed in the Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons is consistent with the Q3
(100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990), and the overlying C horizon represents historicalperiod (<100 B.P.) aeolian deposition.
Auger Probe A2 (PD 30504) was located to the north of Probe A1, on the edge of a coppice dune on
the northwest-trending scarp of the fault trough. The probe was taken to a depth of 1.5 mbs and contained
a C-Bk1-2Bk2b-3Bkmb soil-horizon sequence. The C horizon from 0 to 0.25 mbs consisted of a strong
brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand without pedogenic structure (single grained) and with loose consistence. Underlying the C horizon, a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 loamy very fine sand Bk1 horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure and early Stage I carbonate filaments extended to a depth of 0.95 mbs. Below the
Bk1 horizon, a light brown 7.5YR 6/4 loamy fine sand 2Bk2 horizon with weak medium subangular blocky
structure, very friable consistence, and Stage I carbonate filaments extended from 0.95 mbs to the top of a
petrocalcic horizon (3Bkmb-caliche), at 1.5 mbs. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A2 consist of aeolian
loamy fineâvery fine sand from 0 to 1.5 mbs. The level of soil development observed in the Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons is consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990), and the overlying
C horizon represents historical-period (<100 B.P.) aeolian deposition.
Auger Probe A3 (PD 30506) was located north of Probe A2, on the lower fault scarp. The probe was
taken to a depth of 1.7 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic horizon resulted in auger refusal. The upper 0.1 m
of the probe consisted of a brown 7.5YR 4/4 fine sandy loam C horizon with laminated bedding features
and no visible carbonates. Below the C horizon, a dark brown 7.5YR 3/4 (strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 dry)
loamy very fine sand A horizon with no visible carbonates extended from 0.1 to 0.2 mbs. From 0.2 to
1 mbs, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 (strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 dry) loamy very fineâfine sand Bk1 horizon
with weak medium subangular blocky structure, very friable consistence, and early Stage I carbonate
filaments was described. Underlying the Bk1 horizon, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 (reddish yellow 7.5YR 6/6)
loamy very fineâfine sand 2Bk2b horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure, friable consistence, and Stage I carbonate filaments extended to a depth of 1.5 mbs. At the base of the probe, a brown
7.5YR 5/4 (light brown 7.5YR 6/4 dry) fine sandy loam 3Bkb horizon with moderate medium subangular
blocky structure, friable consistence, and Stage II carbonate nodules extended to refusal, at 1.7 mbs. The
lithostratigraphic units in Probe A3 consisted of aeolian loamy very fineâfine sand from 0 to 1.5 mbs and
aeolian or alluvial fine sandy loam from 1.5 to 1.7 mbs. The level of soil development observed in the
loamy fine sand Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons is consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of
Blair et al. (1990), and the Stage II carbonate morphology in the 3Bkb horizon is consistent with the Q2
(9400â15,000 B.P.) stratigraphic unit. The overlying C horizon represents historical-period (<100 B.P.)
alluvial deposition within the fault trough (Q4 of Blair et al. 1990).
Auger Probe A4 (PD 30508) was located near the lowest part of the fault trough in Transect T-1. The
probe was taken to a depth of 0.9 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic (caliche) horizon resulted in auger refusal.
The upper 0.15 m of the probe consisted of a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand C horizon with laminated
bedding features and loose consistence. Underlying the C horizon, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 (strong brown
7.5YR 5/6 dry) loamy fine sand Bk horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure, very friable
consistence, and early Stage I carbonate filaments extended to 0.8 mbs. At the base of the probe, a 2Bkmb
petrocalcic horizon with Stage IV carbonates was encountered. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A4
27

consist of aeolian loamy fineâvery fine sand from 0 to 0.8 mbs. The level of soil development observed in
the Bk horizon is consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990), and the
overlying C horizon represents historical-period (<100 B.P.) aeolian deposition.
Auger Probe A5 (PD 30510) was located on the north end of the transect, outside the fault trough. The
probe extended to a depth of 0.85 mbs and revealed a C-Bk-2Bkmb soil-horizon sequence. The upper 0.1 m
of the probe consisted of a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand C horizon with laminated bedding features and
loose consistence. Underlying the C horizon, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 (strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 dry)
loamy fine sand Bk horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure, very friable consistence, and
early Stage I carbonate filaments extended to 0.8 mbs. At the base of the probe, a 2Bkmb petrocalcic horizon
with Stage IV carbonates was encountered. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A5 consist of aeolian
loamy fineâvery fine sand from 0 to 0.8 mbs. The level of soil development observed in the Bk horizon is
consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990), and the overlying C horizon
represents historical-period (<100 B.P.) aeolian deposition.

Transect T-2
Transect T-2 was located in the north-central portion of the project area and was oriented northeastâsouthwest (see Figure 8). A total of 5 auger probes were excavated across the transect, with an average depth of
1.54 mbs. The transect bisected an area of high site density associated with a northwest-trending fault
trough. Deflation areas (blowouts) along the fault scarp were connected by shallow alluvial channels that
drain to the north into the fault trough.
Auger Probe A6 (PD 30512) was located on the upper fault scarp, south of the fault trough in Transect T-2. The probe was taken to a maximum depth of 1.8 mbs, revealing a C-Bk1-2Bk2b soil-horizon
sequence. The C horizon from 0 to 0.15 mbs consisted of a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand without
pedogenic structure (single grained) and with loose consistence. Underlying the C horizon, a strong brown
7.5YR 5/6 loamy very fine sand Bk1 horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure and early Stage I
carbonate filaments extended to a depth of 0.9 mbs. Below the Bk1 horizon, a light brown 7.5YR 6/4 loamy
fine sand 2Bk2 horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure, very friable consistence, and Stage I

areas (blowouts) were connected by shallow alluvial channels and a surficial gravel-lag deposit composed
of caliche nodules/fragments.
Probe A27 (PD 30554) was located on a northwest-trending fault scarp near the eastern edge of the
project area. The probe was excavated to a depth of 1.3 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic horizon resulted
in auger refusal. The upper part of the probe, from 0 to 0.1 mbs, contained a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine
sand C horizon with laminated bedding features and loose consistence. Underlying the C horizon, a dark
brown 7.5YR 3/4 (brown 7.5YR 4/4 dry) loamy fine sand A horizon with weak medium subangular blocky
structure extended to a depth of 0.2 mbs. Beneath the A horizon, a brown to strong brown 7.5YR 4/4â4/6
fine sandy loam 2Bk1b horizon with moderate medium subangular blocky structure and early Stage I
carbonate filaments extended to 0.9 mbs. At the base of the probe, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 (strong brown
7.5YR 5/6 dry) fine sandy clay loam 2Bk2b horizon with moderate medium subangular blocky structure
and Stage I carbonate filaments extended to refusal. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A27 consisted of
fine sandy loam to sandy clay loam alluvium from 0.2 to 1.3 mbs (2Bk horizons) and aeolian loamy fine
sand from 0 to 0.2 mbs (C-A horizons). The level of soil development in the alluvial deposits from 0.2 to
1.3 mbs is consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990). Soil development in the aeolian sediments from 0.1 to 0.2 mbs (A horizon) are also consistent with this stratigraphic
unit. The most-recent aeolian sand (C horizon) that composes the present-day sand sheet is historical
period in age (Q4) (Blair et al. 1990).
Auger Probe A28 (PD 30556) was located to the southwest of Probe A27, in a sand sheet adjacent to
a coppice dune. The probe was taken to a depth of 1.8 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic horizon resulted
in auger refusal. The upper part of the probe, from 0 to 0.1 mbs, contained a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine
sand C horizon with laminated bedding features and loose consistence. Beneath the C horizon, a brown to
strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 (strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 dry) loamy fine sand Bk1 horizon with moderate medium
subangular blocky structure and early Stage I carbonate filaments extended to 0.9 mbs. Underlying the
Bk1 horizon, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 (strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 dry) fine sandy loam 2Bk2b horizon
with moderate medium subangular blocky structure and Stage I carbonate filaments extended to 1.5 mbs.
At the base of the probe, a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sandy loam 2Bk2b horizon with moderate medium
subangular blocky structure and Stage I+ carbonates extended to refusal. The lithostratigraphic units in
Probe A28 consisted of fine sandy loam alluvium from 0.9 to 1.8 mbs (2Bk horizons) and aeolian loamy
fine sand from 0 to 0.9 mbs (C-Bk1 horizons). The level of soil development in the alluvial deposits is
consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990). The lower 2Bk2 horizon
with Stage I+ carbonates may correlate to the Q2 (9400â15,000 B.P.) unit, however. Soil development in
the aeolian sediments from 0.1 to 0.90 (Bk1 horizon) are consistent with the Q3 stratigraphic unit, and
the most-recent aeolian sand (C horizon) that composes the present-day sand sheet is historical period in
age (Q4) (Blair et al. 1990).
Auger Probe A29 (PD 30558) was located southwest of Probe A27, on the edge of a coppice dune.
The probe was taken to a depth of 1.5 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic horizon resulted in auger refusal.
The C horizon from 0 to 0.15 mbs consisted of a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand without pedogenic
structure (single grained) and with loose consistence. Underlying the C horizon, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6
fine sandy loam Bw horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure and no visible carbonates
extended to a depth of 0.8 mbs. Below the Bw horizon, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 fine sandy loam
2Bkb horizon with moderate medium subangular blocky structure and Stage I carbonate filaments extended
34

to 1.5 mbs. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A29 consisted of fine sandy loam alluvium from 0.15 to
1.5 mbs and aeolian loamy fine sand from 0 to 0.15 mbs. The level of soil development observed in the
alluvium is consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990), and the overlying
C horizon represents historical-period (<100 B.P.) aeolian deposition.
Auger Probe A30 (PD 30560) was located southwest of Probe A29, on the northeast side of a coppice
dune. The probe was taken to a depth of 0.77 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic horizon resulted in auger
refusal. The C horizon from 0 to 0.1 mbs consisted of a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand without pedogenic
structure (single grained) and with loose consistence. Underlying the C horizon, a brown to strong brown
7.5YR 4/6â4/4 fine sandy loam Bw horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure and no visible
carbonates extended to a depth of 0.5 mbs. Below the Bw horizon, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 fine sandy
loam 2Bkb horizon with moderate medium subangular blocky structure and Stage I carbonate filaments
extended to 1.5 mbs. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A30 consisted of fine sandy loam alluvium
from 0.1 to 0.77 mbs and aeolian loamy fine sand from 0 to 0.1 mbs. The level of soil development observed
in the alluvium is consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990), and the
overlying C horizon represents historical-period (<100 B.P.) aeolian deposition.
Auger Probe A31 (PD 30562) was located southwest of Probe A30, on the edge of a low coppice dune.
The probe was taken to a depth of 0.5 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic horizon resulted in auger refusal.
The upper 0.1 m of the probe consisted of a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand C horizon with laminated
bedding features and loose consistence. Below this horizon, a brown 7.5YR 5/4â4/4 loamy fine sand to
fine sandy loam Bk horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure, common reworked carbonate
nodules, and early Stage I carbonate filaments extended to refusal. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A31
consisted of aeolian loamy fine sand from 0 to 0.5 mbs. Soil development in the aeolian deposit is consistent
with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990). The aeolian sand from 0 to 0.1 mbs is
considered to be historical period in age (Q4) (Blair et al. 1990).
Auger Probe A32 (PD 30564) was located southwest of Probe A31, on the northeast side of a low coppice
dune. The probe was taken to a depth of 0.65 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic horizon resulted in auger
refusal. The upper 0.1 m of the probe consisted of a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand C horizon with
laminated bedding features and loose consistence. Below this horizon, a brown 7.5YR 5/4â4/4 loamy fine
sand to fine sandy loam Bk horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure, common reworked
carbonate nodules, and early Stage I carbonate filaments extended to refusal. The lithostratigraphic units
in Probe A32 consisted of aeolian loamy fine sand from 0 to 0.65 mbs. Soil development in the aeolian
deposit is consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990). The aeolian
sand from 0 to 0.1 mbs is considered to be historical period in age (Q4) (Blair et al. 1990).

Transect T-8
Northâsouth-trending Transect T-8 was located in the southwest portion of the project area, in a region
dominated by coppice dunes, sand sheets, and deflation areas (see Figure 8). A total of four auger probes
were excavated across the transect, with an average maximum depth of 1.1 mbs. Deflation areas (blowouts)
were connected by shallow alluvial channels and a surficial gravel-lag deposit composed of caliche
nodules/fragments. The area of Probe A33 contained a particularly dense gravel-lag deposit.
Auger Probe A33 (PD 30566) was located adjacent to a coppice dune on the northern end of Transect T-8,
near the western boundary of the survey area. The probe was taken to a depth of 0.58 mbs, at which point
a petrocalcic horizon resulted in auger refusal. The upper 0.15 m of the probe consisted of a strong brown
7.5YR 5/6 fine sand C horizon with laminated bedding features and loose consistence. Below this horizon, a
brown 7.5YR 5/4â4/4 loamy fine sand to fine sandy loam Bk horizon with weak medium subangular blocky
structure and early Stage I carbonate filaments extended to refusal. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A33
consisted of aeolian loamy fine sand from 0 to 0.58 mbs. Soil development in the aeolian deposit is consistent
with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990). The aeolian sand from 0 to 0.1 mbs is
considered to be historical period in age (Q4) (Blair et al. 1990).
35

Auger Probe A34 (PD 30568) was located on the edge of a low coppice dune south of Probe A33.
The probe was taken to a depth of 0.72 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic horizon resulted in auger refusal.
The upper 0.1 m of the probe consisted of a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand C horizon with laminated
bedding features and loose consistence. Below this horizon, a brown 7.5YR 5/4â4/4 loamy fine sand to
fine sandy loam Bk horizon with weak medium subangular blocky structure and early Stage I carbonate
filaments extended to refusal. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A33 consisted of aeolian loamy fine
sand from 0 to 0.72 mbs. Soil development in the aeolian deposit is consistent with the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.)
stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990). The aeolian sand from 0 to 0.1 mbs is considered to be historical
period in age (Q4) (Blair et al. 1990).
Auger Probe A35 (PD 30570) was located on a sand sheet south of Probe A34. The probe was taken
to a depth of 1.2 mbs, at which point a petrocalcic horizon resulted in auger refusal. The upper part of the
probe, from 0 to 0.1 mbs, contained a strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 fine sand C horizon with laminated bedding
features and loose consistence. Underlying the C horizon, a brown to dark brown 7.5YR 4/4â34 (strong
brown 7.5YR 5/6 dry) loamy fine sand A horizon, with weak medium subangular blocky structure extended
to a depth of 0.2 mbs. Below the A horizon a brown 7.5YR 5/4â4/4 (brown 7.5YR 5/4 dry) loamy fine
sand Bk horizon with moderate medium subangular blocky structure and early Stage I carbonate filaments
extended to refusal. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A14 consisted of aeolian loamy fine sand from 0
to 1.2 mbs. The level of soil development observed in these aeolian sands is consistent with the Q3 (100â
7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990). The overlying C horizon (sand sheet) represents historicalperiod (<100 B.P.) aeolian deposition (Q4 unit of Blair et al. 1990).
Auger Probe A36 (PD 30572) was located on the edge of a coppice dune south of Probe A35. The
probe was excavated to the maximum depth of 1.9 mbs and revealed a C-Bk1-2Bk2b-3Bk3b-4Bkmb soilhorizon sequence. The upper 0.15 m of the probe consisted of a brown 7.5YR 4/4 fine sandy loam C horizon
with laminated bedding features and no visible carbonates. From 0.15 to 0.6 mbs, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6
(strong brown 7.5YR 5/6 dry) loamy very fineâfine sand Bk1 horizon with weak medium subangular blocky
structure, very friable consistence, and early Stage I carbonate filaments was described. Underlying the
Bk1 horizon, a strong brown 7.5YR 4/6 (reddish yellow 7.5YR 6/6) fine sandy loam 2Bk2b horizon with
moderate medium subangular blocky structure, friable consistence, and Stage I carbonate filaments extended
to a depth of 1.4 mbs. At the base of the probe, a yellowish red 5YR 4/6 sandy clay loam 3Bk3b horizon
with moderate medium subangular blocky structure, friable consistence, and Stage I+ carbonate nodules
extended to 1.9 mbs. The lithostratigraphic units in Probe A36 consisted of aeolian loamy very fineâfine
sand from 0 to 0.6 mbs and alluvial fine sandy loam to sandy clay loam from 1.4 to 1.9 mbs. The level of
soil development observed in the alluvial sandy clay loam at the base of the probe (3Bk3b horizon) is
consistent with the Q2 (9400â15,000 B.P.) stratigraphic unit of Blair et al. (1990). The soil development
in the alluvium from 0.6 to 1.4 mbs and the aeolian loamy fine sand from 0.15 to 0.6 mbs likely correlate
to the Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) stratigraphic unit. The overlying C horizon (coppice-dune sands) represents
historical-period (<100 B.P.) aeolian deposition (Q4 unit of Blair et al. 1990).

Discussion
Geomorphic reconnaissance of the project area revealed two general landform types that consisted of linear
fault-trough complexes and coppice-dune/sand-sheet deflation areas not associated with faults. Auger-probe
testing across these landforms revealed late Quaternary sediments deposited in aeolian, alluvial, and lacustrine
depositional environments. Site-preservation potential was evaluated partially on the presence or absence
of intact soil horizons. Stratigraphic units (i.e., Q3, Q2, etc.) that contained an intact sequence of master
horizons (i.e., A-Bk) have a greater potential to contain intact cultural deposits. An intact A horizon in the
stratigraphic sequence signifies the presence of a former stable surface in which more-extensive cultural
occupation may have taken place. Therefore, profiles with A horizons are considered to have a moderate
36

to high preservation potential (Table 5). On the other hand, those containing a single truncated, diagnostic,
subsurface horizon overlying a culturally sterile deposit (caliche) are considered to have a low or moderately
low preservation potential.

Coppice Dunes/Sand Sheets
Auger probes in areas away from fault scarps and troughs generally revealed truncated Q3 (100â7300 B.P.)
aeolian and alluvial sediments overlying a petrocalcic soil horizon (Q1 stratigraphic unit). Only three probes
were found to contain an intact A horizon below a Q4 sand sheet or coppice dune, and many (particularly
across Transect T-7) revealed a single truncated horizon underlying Q4 sands and overlying a petrocalcic
horizon (see Table 5). Soil morphology indicates many of the truncated Bk or Bw horizons in dune areas are
Q3 in age (100â7300 B.P.). In some instances an increase in secondary carbonates within underlying
2Bkb horizons suggests they correlate to the Q3a (2400â7300 B.P.) unit of Lukowski et al. (2003). Although
most A horizons have been eroded, some site potential still exists in the truncated Bk or Bw soil horizons.
The presence of a surficial gravel lag composed of Stage IIâIII nodules/fragments in deflational areas indicates the stratigraphic context has generally been lost. Additionally, intrabasinal faults have created a
low gradient, even in areas not adjacent to fault troughs. This has resulted in a complex network of shallow
channels connecting deflational areas that have the potential to displace exposed artifacts laterally.

Fault-Trough Complex
Auger probes in fault troughs and along fault scarps generally revealed a more-complete stratigraphic record
compared to areas outside the fault complex. This includes intact A horizons developed in Q3 (100â
7300 B.P.) sediments (n = 10) and Bk horizons with Stage II carbonate morphology suggestive of a Q2
(9400â15,000 B.P.) deposit (n = 5) (see Table 5). Clay-rich lacustrine/playa deposits were also encountered in
several of the fault troughs. Tentatively, these may correlate to the Petts Tank (middleâlate Pleistocene)
or Lake Tank (late Pleistoceneâearly Holocene) unit of Gile et al. (1981). Typically, fault troughs appear
to be infilled with Q2âQ3 alluvium, deposited as drainages developed along the fault complex. These
deposits appear to be thickest along the western edge of the trough, adjacent to the fault scarp (see Figure 8).
The scarps themselves are covered with relatively thick deposits of Q3 aeolian sand, making it difficult to
locate the actual fault. Typically, intact A horizons were not encountered below sand sheets and coppice
dunes in the upper areas of the scarp. These upthrown blocks may have been good locations for sites, as
they provide a good vantage point, and the adjacent fault trough may have provided water during some
parts of the year (Buck 1996:222). However, the higher gradients associated with the scarp face result
in increased erosion (as evidenced by a general lack of intact A horizons) and decrease site preservation.
Deflational areas along the scarp were connected by a complex network of alluvial channels that also have
the potential to distribute exposed artifacts downslope.

Conclusions
Generally, site preservation in the coppice-dune/sand-sheet deflation areas is low to moderately low. Few
intact A horizons were encountered below Q4 aeolian sands, and many areas consisted of a single truncated
Bw or Bk soil horizon bound by culturally sterile units (Q4 and Q1 units). However, fault troughs represent
areas where much of the late Quaternary stratigraphy is relatively intact. Intact A horizons and thick
stratigraphic sequences containing Q2âQ3 lacustrine and/or alluvial sediments were encountered along
the western boarder of several fault troughs. Evidence of the prehistoric use of these fault troughs has a
moderately high probability of being preserved in these areas.

Archaeological Background for Fort Bliss
Bradley J. Vierra and Kari M. Schmidt

Introduction
For much of the twentieth century, archaeological research in west Texas has lagged behind that of many
other regions in the Southwest. In large part, this is because of the regionâs remoteness, the prevalence of
many nonarchitectural hunter-gatherer sites, and a belief held by many that this region was peripheral to
developments in better-known and more archaeologically visible cultural areas (i.e., the Mimbres, the Rio
Grande pueblos, and Casas Grandes). Despite these complications, recent work is proving the region to be
rich in resources that offer important and accessible data for several lines of archaeological inquiry. Some
of these areas of inquiry include the nature of hunter-gatherer mobility and land use in a semiarid environment characterized by spatially and temporally variable biotic resources (Roth 1996; Sobolik 2008; Vierra
2005), the ecological and social aspects underlying a high degree of settlement mobility among forager
and farming groups in the region (LeBlanc 2008; MacWilliams et al. 2008; McBrinn 2005), causal factors
leading to the adoption of maize agriculture in the desert borderland region (Doolittle and Mabry 2006; Hard
et al. 2006; Hard et al. 2008; Mabry and Doolittle 2008), landscape use (Camilli and Ebert 1992; Mauldin
1995, 1996; OâLeary 1987), and how artifact and site distributions are conditioned by geomorphological
factors in active aeolian environments (Mauldin et al. 1998; Schutt 1992).
Archaeological research has been conducted in the vicinity of Fort Bliss since the 1920s, when the
Cosgroves (1947) first conducted excavations in the Hueco Mountains. Lehmerâs (1948) groundbreaking
work on the Jornada Mogollon during the 1940s included sites in the area that contributed toward the
development of a regional cultural-historical sequence (e.g., La Cueva, Los Tules, and the Bradfield site)
(Figure 9). This sequence consisted of Hueco, Mesilla, DoÃ±a Ana, and El Paso phases. Figure 10 presents
a basic chronology of the Jornada Mogollon region adopted from Whalen (1978) and shows other important
regional archaeological schematics. The revised Jornada Mogollon sequence includes the addition of the
Paleoindian period and the division of the Hueco phase into four separate Archaic phases (see Beckett and
MacNeish 1994); however, the latter can also be divided into Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods.
More recently, Miller (2005) has also separated the Mesilla and DoÃ±a Ana phases into earlier and later
periods. Lastly, Mesilla, DoÃ±a Ana, and El Paso phases can also be denoted as Early, Middle, and Late
Formative periods.

Paleoindian Period Research
The Paleoindian period (approximately 10,000â6000 B.C.) has historically been divided into three sequential traditions marked by functional and stylistic differences in tool kits that are generally thought to reflect
changing hunting and settlement adaptations: the Clovis complex, the Folsom complex, and the Plano/Cody
complex (Holliday 1997). Carmichaelâs (1986) survey was the first project to identify substantial numbers
of Paleoindian sites, and most of these represent Folsom and Late Paleoindian (Plano) occupations.
Although there is no conclusive evidence of a Clovis occupation at Fort Bliss, a Clovis campsiteâthe

Mockingbird Gap siteâis situated at the northern end of the San Andres Mountains (Weber and Agogino
1968), the Rhodes Canyon site is located along the eastern side of the San Andres Mountains (Beckett
1983), and a single Clovis point has been reported from McGregor Range (Krone 1976). Fresnal Shelter,
which is located in the Sacramento Mountains, produced two dates from its deepest deposits; these extend
into the latter part of the Paleoindian period (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Although dates ranging from
ca. 11,000 to 30,000 B.P. have been reported from Pendejo Cave, the context and association of these
samples with specific cultural deposits are unclear (MacNeish and Libby 2003).
In contrast to the preceding Clovis period, numerous Folsom period points and occupation sites have
been recorded during archaeological surveys in the larger Fort Bliss region (Amick 1994; Amick and
Lukowski 2006; Beckes 1977; Beckett 1983; Carmichael 1986; Stuart 1997; Vierra et al. 1999; Whalen
1978). Amickâs (1994) study of New Mexico Folsom included sites from the Tularosa Basin, and he
43

suggested that the ancient environment was characterized by a patchy distribution of grasslands and playas,
with small herds of bison moving among these foraging areas. He concluded, therefore, that Folsom groups
were residentially mobile; they followed the movements of these herds and hunted bison and other fauna
during their annual rounds. Projectile points were primarily made of local materials, indicating group movement was regionally restricted; however, the presence of small amounts of Edwards chert in the Tularosa
Basin indicates at least some minimal contact with central or south Texas (see Hofman et al. 1990). A multicomponent Folsom/Archaic site has been excavated in the Fillmore Pass area (Stiger 1988). Carmichaelâs
survey did find that Paleoindian sites were distributed across the basin, including the piedmont at Fillmore
Pass. These groups could have moved through this passageway as they hunted bison in the Rio Grande
Valley and Hueco Bolson settings. More recently, Folsom sites have been reported at Fort Bliss (Stuart
1997:54â56), and excavations have been conducted at FB 1613, situated along the western foothills of the
northern Franklin Mountains; however, this excavation has yet to be fully reported.
Isolated Late Paleoindian points have been observed in the Tularosa Basin, but few sites have been
identified (Amick and Lukowski 2006; Carmichael 1986; OâHara 1988). A single site has been excavated
that yielded over 100 retouched tools, consisting mostly of scrapers with some bifaces and projectile points
(Elyea 1988). Late Paleoindian components have been found across a wide range of topographic zones, including mountains and alluvial fans, but most finds seem to be located in the basin landforms near major
playas or along the margins of the Rio Grande Valley, a pattern that Carmichael (1986) observed in the
Tularosa Basin. In general, the Late Paleoindian period is associated with a general shift from the moist
climatic regime that characterized Folsom times to the seasonal-monsoonal climatic regime that characterizes the modern U.S. Southwest. The persistent drying trend continued, with a resultant demise of largegame mammals, expansion of plant communities adapted to drier conditions, and constriction of perennial
water sources. Therefore, Late Paleoindian groups probably began to focus even more on playa and
ephemeral-stream settings than did their Folsom predecessors, and a large-scale change in subsistence
strategies occurred, requiring diversification. These changes in settlement and technology mark the onset
of the Archaic period at around 6000 B.C.

Archaic Period Research
The Archaic period (6000 B.C.âca. A.D. 250) is characterized by broad-spectrum hunter-gatherers whose
seasonal mobility was conditioned primarily by the abundance and distribution of plant resources (Beckett and
MacNeish 1994; MacNeish 1993; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Vierra 2005). The period encompasses more
than 6,000 years, and several broad adaptive trends and important changes in subsistence and technology
took place during this time. Because of the large span of time the Archaic period covers, it has been
conventionally divided into the Early (6000â4000 B.C.), Middle (4000â1200 B.C.), and Late (1200 B.C.â
A.D. 250) subdivisions, which are defined primarily on the basis of projectile-point typologies but also
correspond broadly to paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions (Huckell 1996; Mallouf 1981;
Mauldin 1995). In comparison to the Paleoindian period, there was an increase in the range of exploited
plant materials and in the technological choices used to process these foods, which indicates a greater
diversification of subsistence practices. Over the course of the Archaic period, it appears that increasing
population levels and diversified subsistence economies led to an intensification of land use and to the exploitation of a continually increasing range of environmental zones. It has been suggested that these processes may have contributed to the adoption of agriculture between ca. 1500 and 1000 B.C. (Vierra 2005).
The Early Archaic period is one of the more poorly documented intervals of time in the Fort Bliss area.
Intensive surveys conducted throughout Fort Bliss and the surrounding areas of El Paso County and New
Mexico have recorded several surface finds of projectile points, but only rarely have features of settlements
been identified (Amick and Lukowski 2006; Carmichael 1986; Lukowski and Stuart 1996). This period
may be associated with the middle Holocene dry period and the movement of Early Archaic groups into
44

adjacent regions (Vierra et al. forthcoming). The presence of Jay and Bajada point types could reflect
limited excursions into these desert areas from the uplands to the north.
Apparently, Middle Archaic groups intensified the use of the borderland deserts following the middle
Holocene dry period. This is supported by the increasing numbers of sites in the region (Amick and Lukowski
2006; Anderson 1993; Carmichael 1986; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; OâLaughlin 1980). Isolated San Joseâ
style, contracting-stem (e.g., Langtry) and large, side-notched points appear to reflect movement between
the Tularosa Basin and upland areas to the north and desert regions to the west, south, and east (Carpenter
et al. 2005; Miller and Shackley 1998). Subsistence, settlement, and technological adaptations established
in the Early Archaic period were changing, with a greater emphasis on smaller-game and plant resources.
This foraging strategy may have also involved the increasing use of upland resources, including piÃ±on
nuts (Vierra 2007).
Andersonâs (1993) study of Archaic site distribution identified a general increase in the number and
sizes of sites from Early through Late Archaic times. Although most of these sites are located in the central
basin, there is a notable absence of Early and Middle Archaic sites from alluvial fans. Anderson has suggested that this pattern can be explained by the initial use of maize agriculture in these alluvial settings
during Late Archaic times; maize was present in the region by ca. 1200 B.C. at Tornillo Rockshelter, Fresnal
Cave, and Cerro JuanaqueÃ±a (Hard and Roney 2005; Tagg 1996; Upham et al. 1987). It is unclear whether the
earlier sites are actually missing or simply buried under the alluvium. Anderson also observed a shift from
the use of informal milling stones to more-formal metates with mortars and pestles over time. This is interpreted as reflecting the increasing use of maize and mesquite during the Late Archaic; however, a study
by Hard et al. (1996) indicated a very low reliance on domesticated foods by Jornada Archaic groups.
2
This interpretation is based on the small surface area of the manos (75.7 cm ), the absence of maize in
flotation samples (0 present), and a lower stable-carbon-isotope value (â16.5 â°).
Anderson (1993) has presented a model for Archaic transhumance patterns based on the availability
of various plant species and macrobotanical data obtained from rockshelters excavated in the nearby foothills
and mountains. She has argued that local Archaic groups moved to the lower basin during the late spring,
summer, and early fall to exploit grasses, mesquite, and rabbits. Alluvial fans were used increasingly for
agriculture during the Late Archaic period. Summer and fall occupations are also evident at rockshelters
in the nearby mountains, where piÃ±on, oak, and deer were exploited and maize was cultivated (Bohrer
2007; MacNeish 1993). Winter sites could have been located in riverine locations where riparian resources
would have been used to supplement winter stores. Overall, Anderson suggested a long-term pattern of
decreasing residential mobility, increasing complexity in the use of environmental zones, and increasing
reliance on maize during the Late Archaic period.

Mesilla Phase Research
The Mesilla phase (Early Formative; A.D. 250â1000) is generally considered to be a continuation of the Archaic period, characterized by a generalized foraging strategy supplemented with maize agriculture (Hard
1986; Whalen 1994a, 1994b) but encompassing several important transitions in settlement adaptations (e.g.,
architectural form, settlement structure, and decreasing mobility). Carmichaelâs (1986) survey identified a dispersed pattern similar to that observed for the Archaic period, with an increase in sites located in alluvial-fan
settings. Some of these sites have middens (containing rabbit bone) and reflect increased occupational intensity. Several Mesilla phase sites have been excavated on Fort Bliss, including Turquoise Ridge (Whalen
1994a, 1994b), Castner Heights (Hard 1983), Conejo (Hard 1988), and others. Whalen (1994a, 1994b) identified both small and large huts at Turquoise Ridge. The smaller structures identified at Turquoise Ridge
were similar to those at Castner Heights and Conejo and the Archaic period structures excavated at the Keystone Dam site (Whalen 1994b), whereas the larger ones represented at the Turquoise Ridge site were more
sophisticated, in that they were larger in size (4 m in diameter), deeper (30 cm), and had more interior and
45

exterior features, including hearths, postholes, storage pits, and trash middens (Whalen 1994a). In addition,
there was a single large pit structure that might have been used for communal activities during the latter
part of the phase. Whalen has suggested that the smaller sites may represent short-term encampments
used seasonally for foraging on the basin floor. In contrast, sites like those at Turquoise Ridge or Los
Tules may have been winter habitations situated on dune ridges along the periphery of the basin or in
riverine settings, respectively. This is similar to the model proposed by Hard (1986), which posits that
smaller structures in the basin were occupied from summer to fall and that larger structures were used in
the alluvial fans and riverine settings during the winter and spring. However, he has suggested that the
Conejo site represents the latter site type and the Huesito site, the former (for a similar argument, see
Carmichael 1986).
Whalenâs (1980, 1981, 1986) preliminary study of ephemeral campsites in the Hueco Bolson revealed
that many could be radiocarbon dated to the Archaic or Mesilla phase but not the El Paso phase. Therefore,
Archaic and Mesilla phase camps may be numerous in the basin; only a few of these appear to represent
El Paso limited-activity sites. Mauldinâs (1994, 1996) âsmall siteâ study used both radiocarbon and obsidianhydration dating to temporally assign these sites. The results of the radiocarbon dating portion of his study
were similar to Whalenâs; that is, most of the sites dated to the Late Archaic period and Mesilla phase,
and practically none dated to the El Paso phase. In contrast, the obsidian-hydration dates indicated a
continued use of the basin from the Archaic period and Mesilla phase to the El Paso phase.
2
Hard et al.âs (1996) study identified a small increase in the surface area of manos (111.5 cm ) and the
ubiquity of maize in flotation samples (3 percent) between the Late Archaic period and the Mesilla phase.
A higher stable-carbon-isotope value of â9.5 â° was considered to be the result of the additional dietary
importance of succulents (e.g., agave), in addition to maize. The presence of pestles on Mesilla phase
sites across the basin reflects the continued use of mesquite (Carmichael 1986). Miller and Kenmotsu
(2004) also noted the prevalence of mesquite in Mesilla phase flotation samples.
Although ceramics made their appearance during this period (between ca. A.D. 200 and A.D. 400), it
appears that dart points (e.g., San Pedro) were still being used coincident with the bow and arrow
ca. A.D. 900â1000 (Kelly 1984:113; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). This is much later than observed in the
Middle Rio Grande area, where ceramics and the bow and arrow first appeared around A.D. 400 (Vierra
and Ford 2007), but is similar to the pattern described in southern Arizona (VanPool 2006). The El Paso
Brown tradition remained remarkably stable during the entire Mesilla phase, which is the equivalent of
the pit-house period seen in other regions (e.g., southwestern New Mexico [De Atley 1980], the Mimbres
Mogollon [Lekson 1990], and the Casas Grandes region [Dean and Ravesloot 1993]). Miller and Burtâs
(2007) study of Mesilla phase pottery indicates a relatively homogenous technology geared toward a
residentially mobile community, including mostly neckless jars (i.e., tecomates), thinner walls, and finetempered vessels.

DoÃ±a Ana Phase Research
The DoÃ±a Ana phase (Middle Formative; A.D. 1000â1275/1300) represents the transitional pit-house-topueblo period in the Jornada Mogollon region (Whalen 1981). As exemplified in the northern and Middle
Rio Grande Valley, this transitional period can represent a time of economic diversity, characterized by groups
practicing a mix of foraging and agriculture in response to the changing natural and cultural landscape
(Vierra and Bremer 2007). Carmichael (1986) was the only researcher to systematically record possible
DoÃ±a Ana phase sites during his survey, and he found that these sites were clustered in the lower alluvial
fans west of Coe Lake and at the base of the Jarilla Mountains. DoÃ±a Ana phase sites were generally larger
(2.0 ha) than the earlier Mesilla (0.6 ha) or later El Paso (1.0 ha) phase sites and more frequently contained
middens (51 percent versus 4 percent and 18 percent, respectively). Rabbit bone was also observed in these
middens, and the presence of pestles denotes the continued use of mesquite. Carmichael has
46

suggested that this pattern represents a marked increase in occupational intensity when compared to both
the Mesilla and El Paso phases; however, Hard et al.âs (1994) ceramic study indicates a gradual change in jar
size and frequency that reflects a continuum and peak in agricultural production during the El Paso phase
and not the DoÃ±a Ana. Hard et al.âs (1994) data also reflect an increase in maize ubiquity and mano sur2
2
face area between the DoÃ±a Ana (29 percent; 131.4 cm ) and El Paso (54 percent; 158.9 cm ) phases. This
compares with Miller and Kenmotsuâs (2004) study that identified the prevalence of cacti in DoÃ±a Ana
phase flotation samples versus maize in the El Paso phase samples. This pattern correlates with the marked
increased in DoÃ±a Ana phase rock-lined roasting features (i.e., burned-rock middens) in alluvial-fan and
upland areas where agave and other similar plants are located (Miller 2005). This strategy appears to
represent an attempt to intensify the exploitation of less-productive resources like cacti (see Dering 2005).
In addition, the few excavated DoÃ±a Ana sites at Fort Bliss and nearby Hueco Tanks contain rectangular
pit structures and not pueblos (Kegley 1982; Miller 1989; Scarborough 1989a, 1989b), although Beckes
et al. (1977:73) did note âsigns of above-ground adobe structuresâ at some DoÃ±a Ana sites on McGregor
Range. Miller (2005) reported a marked increase in the presence of rectangular to subrectangular pit
structures and the initial presence of isolated rooms and contiguous pueblo rooms by ca. A.D. 1000 at the
beginning of the DoÃ±a Ana phase, with a marked increase in the latter two architectural features by
A.D. 1200. All of this appears to indicate a general pattern of increasing residential stability and resource
intensification during the DoÃ±a Ana phase.
A recurring problem in Jornada Mogollon archaeology is the discrimination of DoÃ±a Ana phase sites
from sites representing multiple Mesilla and El Paso phase occupations. The DoÃ±a Ana phase is considered
transitional, and prevalent ceramics for the phase consist of El Paso Brown, El Paso Bichrome, and El
Paso Polychrome. Intrusive wares common on DoÃ±a Ana phase sites include Mimbres Black-on-white,
San Francisco Red, Alma Plain, and Mimbres Corrugated (all from sites in the Mogollon region of southwestern New Mexico); Chupadero Black-on-white and Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta from areas to the
north and east of the project area in central and south-central New Mexico; and St. Johns Polychrome from
east-central Arizona or west-central New Mexico. Hard et al. (1994) have addressed this problem by studying
a series of excavated Mesilla, DoÃ±a Ana, and El Paso phase sites. Their analysis of these respective ceramic
assemblages indicates that DoÃ±a Ana sites should contain 20â50 percent El Paso Brown, 10â25 percent
El Paso Bichrome, and 50â70 percent El Paso Polychrome, numbers that contrast with both the Mesilla
and El Paso phase site samples. In addition, DoÃ±a Ana ceramic assemblages are characterized by an early
variety of El Paso Polychrome rim sherds. These assemblages should be dominated by a rim-sherd index
(RSI) of slightly greater than 1 (i.e., direct). This contrasts with an RSI value of approximately 1.4 for the
late variety of the polychrome commonly found on El Paso phase sites. In addition, jar size seems to have
increased from the Mesilla phase (mean = 18.4 cm) to the DoÃ±a Ana (mean = 20.2 cm) and El Paso
(mean = 27.6 cm) phases, which provides another possible avenue for discriminating site occupation and
presumably reflects an increasing dependence on stored foods. Nonetheless, as argued by Miller (2005),
changes in subsistence, thermal-feature function, and architecture may provide a more accurate reflection
of socioeconomic change during this period.

El Paso Phase Research
The El Paso phase (Late Formative; A.D. 1275/1300â1450) represents the culmination of a long-term trend
of increasing dependence on maize agriculture. This process played out throughout New Mexico but occurred
later in the Jornada Mogollon area and never achieved the degree of site size or complexity exhibited in
the northern Rio Grande Valley. Nonetheless, we cannot assume a unilinear scheme of cultural evolution
in the region but rather must consider that a variety of hunting, gathering, and agricultural strategies were
used to cope with a changing natural and cultural environment.

47

Millerâs (2005) architectural study indicates a pattern of increasing site stability during the El Paso
phase. This includes the presence of numerous isolated surface rooms, contiguous pueblo rooms, and a
marked increase in storage and trash-filled pits. However, these contiguous room blocks consist solely of
a single row of rooms and not multiple rows as reported in the northern Rio Grande Valley (Vierra and
Schmidt 2006). Nonetheless, coupled with these changes was a shift toward the increasing use of playa
margins and river-valley terraces that presumably reflects the increasing importance of high-water-table
farming. Studies of the botanical and ground stone evidence by Hard et al. (1996) and Miller and Kenmotsu
(2004) reveal an increasing reliance on maize agriculture during the El Paso phase, and higher stablecarbon-isotope values (ca. â8.0 â°) indicate this, as well. Indeed, maize surpasses other plant remains in
these Late Formative period flotation samples.
Various studies reveal changes in settlement distribution that appear to coincide with an increasing
dependence on maize cultivation during the El Paso phase. For example, Whalenâs (1977, 1978, 1981)
surveys identified a clustering of El Paso phase sites along the periphery of the basin. In contrast, Carmichael
(1986) observed clusters both on the lower alluvial fan near Coe Lake and around large playas northeast
of the lake. He stated that Whalenâs El Paso site âcore areaâ is actually located near playa depressions
(Carmichael 1986:230). These large playas can hold water from July to February. Beckes et al. (1977:73,
75) also observed a shift in settlement patterns, with most DoÃ±a Ana phase sites situated in âlarge draws
and canyonsâ of the Hueco Mountains and the El Paso sites in the âlower desert basin.â In addition, three
El Paso phase reservoirs have been identified. Two of these features are located at the distal ends of
alluvial fans adjacent to the Hueco Mountains. One of these is associated with Meyer Pithouse Village (Bentley 1993; Scarborough 1988) and was identified by a large surface depression situated about
400 m from the pueblo. Excavations revealed that the reservoir had been dug into an underlying layer of
3
caliche, with overall dimensions of 24 m by 13 m by 1.8 m in depth and a maximum capacity of 182 m .
A second reservoir, the Hueco Mountain Reservoir, has been identified 11.7 km southwest of Hot Well
Village (Leach et al. 1993). This feature was identified by a surface artifact scatter and a circular distribution
of caliche fragments. Excavations determined that the reservoir measured 10 m by 8 m by 2.3 m in depth,
3
with a maximum capacity of 125 m , and also had been dug into the underlying layer of caliche. The third
reservoir is located on an alluvial fan on the eastern slopes of the Organ Mountains. The reservoir at FB
9122 was associated with a surface artifact scatter and a berm that was investigated during backhoe
investigations (MacWilliams et al. 2009). Excavations revealed dark, organic-rich muds and laminated
fine sands that appeared in stark contrast to the more-coarse-grained alluvial-fan sediments adjacent to
the feature. The reservoir at FB 9122 measured 13 m by 10 m by 1.7 m in depth and had an estimated
3
volume of 70 m .
Whalen (1978:44) did observe a possible shift in the timing of the occupation of these El Paso phase
sites and has suggested that sites located along the eastern side of the basin may have been occupied
earlier than those on the western side of the basin. This is based on the fact that the eastern villages
appear to contain relatively more Chupadero Black-on-white and Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta. In
contrast, the western villages contain relatively less Chupadero Black-on-white, no Three Rivers Red-onterracotta, and more Casas Grandes and southern Arizona wares. Skelton et al. (1981) and Carmichael
(1986) also reported higher percentages of Casas Grandes wares than Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta in
their western-basin surveys. A factor analysis conducted by Carmichael (1986:74) on the extensive ceramic-type data generated by the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) survey of Maneuver Areas 3â8
provides preliminary support for the notion that earlier El Paso phase sites can be distinguished on the
basis of their ceramic assemblages. Carmichaelâs analysis determined that three factors accounted for
most of the variability in his ceramic data set. Factor 2 represented a mixture of Mesilla and DoÃ±a Ana
phase ceramic types dominated by El Paso Brown and Mimbres Black-on-white, and Factors 1 and 3
were each dominated by El Paso phase types. Factor 1 included El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Blackon-white, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, and Playas Red Incised, and Factor 3 included El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-white, Casas Grandes wares, and Los Lunas Black-on-white. Carmichael
suggested that Factor 1 represented a mixture of early El Paso phase types, whereas Factor 3 represented
types characteristic of the later El Paso phase. Despite these suggestive data, however, whether Whalenâs
48

east-to-west pattern actually represents a shift in population or the western sites were simply occupied
longer remains undetermined.

Post-Pueblo (A.D. 1450â1535) and Historical-Period
(A.D. 1535âPresent) Research
Very little evidence exists for the occupation of sites at the end of the El Paso phase. Between A.D. 1450
and 1500, pueblo farming communities in the Jornada Mogollon region appear to have been abandoned.
Burned rooms with in situ floor assemblages have been observed at Hot Well, Escondida, and Embree
Pueblos (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004), and there is some evidence for large-scale burning of structures at
Embree Pueblo (Bentley n.d.). The Casas Grandes region was also abandoned around A.D. 1450. Carmichael (1986) has suggested that the local farming communities in these areas shifted to a hunting-andgathering lifestyle similar to that practiced by indigenous groups (see Naylor 1969 for discussion of the
Suma). Beckett and Corbett (1992:41) have argued that the historic Manso people are descendants of the
El Paso phase populations. Radiocarbon dates reflect the continued occupation of the area (Miller 2001),
and recent archaeological excavations near Santa Teresa indicate the presence of Apache groups by the
fifteenth or sixteenth centuries (Moore et al. 1996). By the seventeenth century, it appears that the local
Manso either merged with other Pueblo people residing at the missions in the lower valley or with Apache
people residing in the region (Seymour 2002:335).
Several themes exist for the post-pueblo and early historical period in the area, including the study of
the complex relationships among the indigenous populations (Manso, Suma, and Apache), resettled puebloan
groups from New Mexico (e.g., Piro and Tiwa), and European colonists and how rapidly changing economic
and social arrangements among these groups are reflected in aspects of material culture and the structure
of communities. In their work in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Peterson and Brown (1994) suggested that
the Native American communities assimilated to some degree into the colonial Spanish culture, and Vierra
et al. (1997) provided data to show that the local Hispanic society, at least in the San Elizario area, kept
its links with Mexico even after the inclusion of the territory in the United States.
Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca headed the first Spanish expedition to cross the Rio Grande in 1535,
and the Coronado, Chamuscado-Rodriguez, and Espejo expeditions passed through the El Paso area in
1541, 1581, and 1582, respectively (Seymour 2002:20â30). In 1597, Juan de OÃ±ate led soldiers and
colonists from Mexico to a colony in northern New Mexico near present-day San Juan Pueblo. OÃ±ateâs
expedition followed the Rio Grande along the route that became known as the Camino Real, and El Paso
became an important community along this route. Disease and drought severely affected the El Paso
area during the latter part of the 1600s, and Apache raiding impacted Spanish expansion within the area.
The presidio at San Elizario was constructed in 1789 to protect merchant traffic along the Camino Real.
Surviving Manso and Suma people had mostly assimilated into the Spanish population by the end of the
eighteenth century (Beckett 1994; Griffen 1979); by 1802, it is estimated that there were approximately
35,000 people living in or near the community of El Paso (Timmons 1990).
Mexico achieved independence from Spain in 1821, and the Spanish trade policy was reversed. Spain
had prohibited trade between Mexico and foreign countries, and within a few years of Mexican independence,
traders from the United States entered the El Paso area. As a result, American citizens began to conduct an
increasing amount of business in this area (Metz 1988; Timmons 1990). This short-lived flurry of trade
was strained when the Texas Revolution, the Texas invasion of New Mexico in 1841, and the annexation
of Texas increased tensions between Mexico and the United States, and tensions culminated in a declaration of war against Mexico in 1846. On Christmas Day, 1846, a United States Army contingent fought
with Mexican troops at Brazito, which is 28 miles upriver from El Paso. Victorious, the Americans
entered El Paso, and U.S. military activity began its development in the El Paso region. The Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in 1848 and delineated a new international boundary that ran along the
49

Rio Grande, from its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico to El Paso and then due west to the Pacific Ocean. The
establishment of routes between El Paso and settlements and military posts to the east and west was a
primary concern of the federal government, and after the Civil War, railroads became the primary means
for opening areas of the western part of the United States for commerce and development. The railroad
reached El Paso in 1881.
The military became an important part of El Pasoâs economy beginning just after the Mexican Revolution. Fort Bliss began as a military post in 1849 when units of the Third Infantry were first garrisoned
in El Paso. The original post was abandoned in 1851 and was opened in a new location in 1854. At that
time, the fort was a key link in the chain of forts between Santa Fe and San Antonio that were intended to
protect the western frontier against Indian campaigns. This location was maintained on and off during the
Civil War until 1868, when a new location farther from the floods of the Rio Grande was selected (Abbott
et al. 1996). The new post was abandoned in 1877, but the lawlessness promoted by the absence of military
troops again necessitated the need for cavalry, and the fourth location for the fort was established in 1879.
The newly granted railroad right-of-way through this post location forced the fifth and final relocation of
the post in 1893 (Abbott et al. 1996).
During the Spanish-American War in 1898, several regiments were active at Fort Bliss, and beginning in
the early 1900s, both the fort and El Paso began to grow in size and importance. During World War I, the
fort served a key role in training units bound for the European Theater. In 1919, Biggs Army Airfield was
established. After World War I, housing construction for troops changed the appearance of the post, and
areas around Fort Bliss expanded because of associated residential development. By the end of World
War II, Fort Bliss had begun its new incarnation with the establishment of the Armyâs first guided-missile
unit in late 1945 (Abbott et al. 1996:3). During the Cold War, Fort Bliss was one of the Armyâs premier
centers for air defense training, a focus that has continued through current Army missions.

Ranching and Homesteading Activities in the Fort Bliss Area (1870sâ1940s)
Until the middle of the nineteenth century, livestock were primarily confined to settlements along the Rio
Grande because many other areas (e.g., the Tularosa Basin) were still subject to Apache attacks (Wilson
et al. 1989) and had relatively little water. Once Apache raids subsided, ranching and homesteading
expanded into the Tularosa Basin, the Sacramento Mountains, and the western slope of the Organ Mountains (Faunce 1997). In the late 1880s, there was a boom in the cattle industry, and many families from
other parts of Texas, Mexico, and the United States relocated to the Tularosa Basin to begin ranching
activities. Several factors favored the rapid development of the cattle industry at this time: (1) the invention of deep-well drill equipment gave ranchers access to water, (2) the newly opened railroad provided
access from remote areas to the markets, (3) the invention of barbed wire in 1873 allowed the fencing of
vast areas, and (4) new capital from both foreign and domestic sources was available to finance the ranching
activities (Faunce 1997). Although the ranching operations in the basin seemed to be undertaken primarily by
wealthy Texas families, homesteading activities, in general, were carried out by families of more meager
incomes who focused on subsistence farming.
Regardless of the type of activity undertaken, water was a persistent problem for the ranchers and
homesteaders in the Tularosa Basin (Faunce 1997). Unpredictable precipitation was particularly problematic, because many of the ranching and farming activities depended on runoff. When water did flow, the
rights to water became a source of controversy among the occupants of the basin, which led to many problems.
Both large ranching operations (e.g., Oliver Leeâs ranch) and smaller, individually owned ranches were located
in the area, and overgrazing of the Tularosa Basin had damaged resources by the early 1900s (Faunce 1997).

Research Design
Bradley J. Vierra

Introduction
The historic-preservation process at Fort Bliss is guided by the research emphases and overall historic context presented in the Significance and Research Standards for Prehistoric Archeological Sites at Fort Bliss
(Miller, Kenmotsu, et al. 2009). These standards provide a two-tiered approach for evaluating eligibility
for listing in the NRHP. The first tier involves determining whether the site contains geomorphic and
spatial integrity and the potential for chronometric dating. Of course, each site has intrinsic qualities that
include its geomorphic context (site integrity), chronology (temporal framework), and paleoenvironmental
context. If the site meets these requirements, then the second tier identifies the data potential to address
specific research domains and historic contexts.
The current research design was written using the previous significance standards written by Abbott
et al. (1996) in Significance Standards for Prehistoric Archeological Sites at Fort Bliss. In that document,
Abbott and his coauthors examined current archaeological knowledge about the Fort Bliss region and laid
out seven specific research domains for further archaeological work in the area. These research domains
are intended both to focus archaeological research on specific periods and types of historic properties and
to serve as a basis for generating detailed research questions for a specific project. These research domains
also influence the decision-making process regarding which sites are eligible for listing in the NRHP:
important or significant sites will be those with the potential to contribute to archaeological knowledge of
a particular domain or domains. The seven research domains laid out by Abbott et al. (1996) are chronometrics, geomorphic processes, paleoenvironment, settlement history and land use, subsistence and seasonality, technology, and cultural interaction and exchange. This contrasts with the five research domains defined
by Miller, Kenmotsu, et al. (2009), which consist of subsistence and subsistence economy, technology, site
formation and site structure, settlement patterns and land use, and social-ritual, political, and economic
organization. In this case, chronometrics and geomorphic processes are topics used to evaluate whether
the site meets the first level of eligibility requirements. Paleoenvironment relates to the overall context of
the site(s) and therefore does not directly contribute to its eligibility. Information derived from the research
domains can be used to develop project-specific research designs for evaluating specific archaeological
sites for their research potential, significance, and potential eligibility for listing in the NRHP.
Past research at Fort Bliss has shown that Archaic foragers primarily focused their activities in the central basin, with a possible shift in land use to include maize cultivation on the surrounding upland fans during
the Late Archaic period. Archaic groups would also have continued their annual rounds into surrounding
upland areas during the fall in order to collect piÃ±on nuts and hunt deer (Anderson 1993; Bohrer 2007;
Mauldin 1996). Mesilla phase (Early Formative period) settlement may have continued this pattern of lowland warm-season occupations and upland cool-season occupations (Hard 1987, 1993). Riverine settings,
however, may have also included winter occupations. There appears to have been an important change in
land-use strategies during the DoÃ±a Ana phase (Middle Formative period), with an increase in the use of
upland areas, apparently associated with a peak in the presence of rock-lined features and cacti in flotation
samples. This increase is followed by a potential decrease in the use of the upland fans, with the return to
an emphasis on lowland-basin settlements during the El Paso phase (Late Formative period). The long-term
subsistence pattern appears to reflect a changing emphasis, from mesquite exploitation during the Late ArchaicâEarly Formative period to cacti and succulents during the Middle Formative period to maize during
51

the Late Formative period (Miller 2005; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Nonetheless, these populations were
presumably responding to subtle changes in climate and resource structure by integrating various mixes of
foraging and maize cultivation into their economies. These decisions would have had a significant effect on
past land-use strategies and their archaeological correlates.
Ranching, homesteading, and the railroad had profound influences on the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century occupation of the basin (Faunce 1997). Therefore, this historic archaeological record could
be used to help clarify land use, subsistence patterns, railroad and local market activities, and the consumption of manufactured goods.

Our Approach
Understanding the relationship between foraging and cultivation is a significant research issue in southwestern archaeology and is especially critical to understanding how desert populations like the Jornada
Mogollon coped with their changing environment. SRIâs approach involves several different avenues of
inquiry aimed at evaluating differing aspects of foraging, cultivation, residential mobility, residential stability, and technology and how these correspond with changes in climate and resource structure. For example, increasing diet breadth may be associated with decreasing rainfall and the use of lower-ranked resources like maize and cacti (see Dello-Russo 1999; Dering 2005; Hard and Roney 2005). Residential
stability is reflected in an increase in site-occupation span, which is often associated with a dependence
on stored foods (e.g., maize), and can also be reflected in a shift from residential to logistical mobility
(Binford 1980). Foragers tend to be more mobile and create ephemeral campsites, whereas cultivators are
often tethered to cultivated lands and stored-food caches, occupying residential sites for longer periods.
Small, ephemeral campsites are dispersed across the Hueco Bolson, many of which date to the Archaic or
Early Formative periods (see Mauldin 1996; Miller 2005; Whalen 1986). On the other hand, large palimpsests covering more than 70 ha have also been identified there. These larger sites reflect multiple occupations and contain numerous artifacts, features, and ceramics dating to the Formative period. Mauldin (1996)
suggested that the sites may reflect a shift from residential to logistical use of the local landscape. The
presence of natural catch basins or depressions appears to have been an important factor in the selection of
these site locations (see Leckman et al. 2008; OâLaughlin 1987:46; OâLeary et al. 1997:231). Smaller
groups may have moved out into a wider foraging range during periods of increased effective moisture in
order to take advantage of small resource patches around seasonal playas, and larger groups may have focused on more reliable water sources (e.g., Coe Lake or the Rio Grande Valley) during periods of decreased
effective moisture. The results are complicated patterns of varying site intensity and reuse over time. Information on feature function and site organization will be critical to unraveling the details of specific site histories. Also, the degree of residential-site stabilityâas expressed by the differential presence of isolated
hearths, pit structures, jacal/adobe rooms, activity areas, refuse areas, and processing and/or storage featuresâneeds to be understood (Hitchcock 1987; Kroll and Price 1991; Rafferty 1985; Rocek and BarYosef 1998). In addition to degrees of residential mobility, changes in lithic and ceramic technology are
expected to correspond to varying mixtures of foraging and cultivation (Vierra 2005).

Eligibility Contexts
Chronometrics and Geomorphology
At a basic level, the research potential of archaeological materials encountered during the survey process is derived from two factors: their temporal placement and their geomorphological integrity. It is therefore critical that evaluations (1) examine whether a particular site has the potential to be accurately dated, (2) obtain
at least a basic idea of the siteâs specific geomorphological associations, and (3) determine whether cultural
deposits at the site retain structural integrity.
Indicators of a siteâs potential for absolute or relative dating include the presence or absence of charcoal,
organic stains, and other materials that could potentially be subjected to accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)
radiocarbon dating, as well as the presence or absence of temporally diagnostic projectile points, ceramic
types, or other artifacts that could provide a relative date. Assessments of site geomorphology should begin
with a characterization of the specific geomorphic contexts within which surface cultural material is encountered.
Once the overall geomorphic context of a site has been identified, the integrity of site deposits should
be evaluated. The probable presence or absence of subsurface cultural deposits should be evaluated, indicators of whether site structure is intact or compromised should be noted, and major sources of natural or
human-caused disturbance should be noted and evaluated. Prior geomorphological work at Fort Bliss provides
a rich context for interpreting the sedimentary sequences and the aeolian and alluvial processes at work
within the present project area (Abbott et al. 1996; Johnson 1997; Monger 1993). This research issue
addresses the chronometrics and geomorphology research domains.

Eligibility Questions
1. To what extent can chronological determinations (absolute or relative) be made for each site?
2. Are intrasite chronological variation and patterning present, and if so, what are the implications?
3. How do the chronological determinations of the project sites compare to those of other relevant sites
in the area?
4. What is the geomorphic context of the cultural deposits and surrounding sediments for the sites?
5. Are the cultural deposits in a primary or a secondary context, and what are the implications of these
associations?

Data Requirements
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢

The presence of material suitable for AMS radiocarbon dating (charcoal, organic stains, pedogenic
carbonates, soil/sediments, shell, or bone)
Temporally diagnostic artifacts (including artifact attributes that facilitate seriations)
Description and identification of local soil horizons and geomorphic units
Identification of the relationships among artifacts, features, surface versus subsurface cultural material, and geomorphic context
Comparable data sets from previous work

Land Use and Landscape in the Southern Maneuver Areas
The project is located in the Southern Maneuver Areas of Fort Bliss. The majority of the sites in the project area are small, nondiagnostic or aceramic lithic scatters that cannot be attributed to any specific time
53

period. They are dispersed across the basin in the same fashion as Archaic and Mesilla phase sites, measure
less than 0.25 ha in size, lack diagnostic artifacts, and contain one or two hearths (Mauldin 1994:189).
Whalenâs (1980, 1981, 1986) preliminary study of these sites revealed that many could be radiocarbon
dated to the Archaic period or the Mesilla phase of the Formative period but not to the El Paso phase.
Therefore, Archaic and Mesilla phase camps may be numerous in the basin, and only a few of the sites
appear to represent El Paso phase limited-activity sites. Studies of âsmall sitesâ by Mauldin (1994, 1996)
and Mauldin et al. (1998) used both radiocarbon and obsidian-hydration dating to temporally assign these
sites. The results of the radiocarbon-dating portion of these studies were similar to Whalenâsâthat is, most
of the sites dated to the Late Archaic period and Mesilla phase, and practically none dated to the El Paso
phase. Organizational changes apparently occurred with respect to the way the prehistoric inhabitants of
the area used the basin. For example, the presence of hearths at small sites during the Archaic period and
Mesilla phase indicates the dispersed residential use of the basin. In contrast, the absence of hearths, along
with the presence of datable obsidian artifacts, indicates that El Paso phase populations may have been
using the basin in a logistical fashion, with task groups exploiting wild resources and returning to their
nearby villages. This research issue addresses the land-use and subsistence research domains.

Research Questions
1. How do potential activities associated with a site relate to subsistence resources or raw materials
possibly available in the vicinity?
2. What sorts of subsistence or resource-procurement activities are indicated by the cultural materials
present at the sites? In particular, is there evidence of agricultural activities?
3. What do documented cultural materials indicate about the duration and intensity of activity at the sites?
4. Are different activities, or differences in the durations and intensities of activities, indicated by differing site locations relative to local drainage catchments or playa margins?
5. Are sites preferentially situated in some locations relative to local drainage catchments and playa
margins?
6. How do the small and large sites identified in these catchments fit into broader regional patterns of
settlement and land use?
7. Are there differing scales of feature and artifact clustering, and if so, what implications do these
have with respect to understanding past land use?
8. Is there any evidence for the historical-period use of the project area, and if so, how do these data
inform us about ranching and/or homestead land use?

Technology, Mobility, and Social Boundaries
How people positioned themselves across the landscape was directly linked with the distribution of rainfall and with plant and animal populations. Changes in resource structure required changes in settlement
organization and, possibly, subsistence strategies. The basic subsistence needs of prehistoric populations
required not only technology (facilities and tools) but also labor. The survival of a forager depended on
being in the right place at the right time and having the appropriate technology. Therefore, mobility was
critical to gathering information on the distribution of subsistence resources. In contrast, agricultural societies relied on exchange networks to provide backup strategies in case of local resource shortfalls. These
networks often involved the exchange of various goods among group members located in different communities. Over time, the occupants of the Hueco Bolson developed various economic strategies to survive
the changing natural and cultural environment, including a mix of foraging and cultivation.
Mobility has often been linked with technology. For example, some researchers consider that mobility
limits the size and number of tools that a group can efficiently carry (Carr 1994; Ebert 1979). Others argue
that bifaces are portable tools that can also act as multipurpose tools for mobile groups, whereas simple flake
technologies are expedient and sufficient for sedentary groups (Parry and Kelly 1987). In addition, studies
have identified differences in stone-tool technology when comparing various Archaic campsites with habitation sites: the former emphasize biface production and maintenance, and the latter, a mix of core reduction and tool production and maintenance. Agricultural campsites tend to resemble Archaic habitations, and
agricultural villages emphasize core reduction (Roth 1998; Vierra 2003, 2005). Ceramic technology has
also been linked with mobility and the importance of multifunctional tecomates versus more-specialized
vessels for cooking, storage, and consumption activities at residentially stable communities (Heckman et al.
2008; Miller and Burt 2007; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Recent research has identified important changes in regional forager and agricultural social networks.
These changes partly reflect changing foraging strategies from Paleoindian through Archaic times. Folsom
groups presumably moved great distances while hunting bison, a tactic that would have been especially
successful in areas adjacent to seasonal playas (Amick 1994). Early Archaic groups witnessed a shift to
warmer and drier conditions during the middle Holocene and presumably moved out of the southern deserts
to more-favorable climes. Middle Archaic groups resumed the seasonal use of the area in response to increasing climatic amelioration, as revealed by evidence of movement from the north, south, and east (Miller
2002; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). McBrinnâs (2005) recent study of Late Archaic projectile points identified regional social networks that linked the Mogollon cave sites with rockshelters in the nearby Sacramento Mountains.
Long-term changes in regional social networks continued through the Early, Middle, and Late Formative periods. Late Archaic ties to the west appear to have continued during the Early Formative period,
evidenced by Mimbres Black-on-white ceramics present on some Mesilla phase sites. As Miller (2005) has
pointed out, the Middle Formative period is set within a regional backdrop of the Pueblo IâII and is transitional to Classic periods to the north and west, respectively, whereas the Late Formative period is set
within the Classic and Medio periods to the north and south, respectively. Therefore, it appears that the
Jornada Mogollon forager-cultivators were primarily observers, whereas other regional groups had more
significant influence on the region in terms of long-term cultural change. This research issue addresses the
technology and cultural interaction research domains.

Research Questions
1. What is the nature of the assemblage variability represented among the project sites, and what is the
implication of these data for understanding changes in mobility and technology?
2. What materials, forms, and types of lithic and ceramic artifacts are present, and what are their
implications for understanding changes in technology, mobility, and social interaction?
3. What raw-material types are represented by the lithic artifacts present on sites identified by the
project, and what is the geographic range of these materials?

Project Methods
A. C. MacWilliams

As specified in the POW (Vierra et al. 2008:1), the three goals of this survey project were identifying and
characterizing cultural resources within the 5,000-acre project area, documenting the composition and spatial
associations of these cultural resources, and providing explicit NRHP recommendations to the Texas State
Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for all identified archaeological sites. Methods used to achieve these
goals are described in this chapter.

Determination of Significance and NRHP Eligibility
The revised Fort Bliss site significance standards (Miller, Church, et al. 2009:14.1) present a two-tiered
approach for assessing site significance. These standards provide a rigorous framework that is implementable in the field and through the rest of the evaluation process for any site. The two-tiered approach stipulates first evaluating the chronological potential and the geomorphic context of a site. The underlying premise is that a site normally cannot provide interpretable data without chronological constraint and without
contextual integrity. Paleoenvironmental data potential may come into consideration at this level of analysis in uncommon circumstances. Sites lacking chronological dating potential or geomorphic integrity offer no basis for NRHP eligibility. Sites that meet these prerequisites can be evaluated in the framework of
historic contexts, which are the second tier of the site evaluation process. The historic contexts are broad
constructs that frame chronological placement, geographic extent, and those research domains pertinent to
an overarching research issue (theme). The research domains are discussed in Chapter 5 of this report.
In instances where the first two criteria are favorably met, Tier 2 criteria are considered. These criteria
fall into five research domains: subsistence, technology, site structure and formation, settlement pattern
and land use, and social organization. When assessing site integrity, it is necessary to determine which
aspects of the site may provide relevant information for addressing a specific research domain. Additionally,
minimum assemblage thresholds for a recommendation of eligible (for listing in the NRHP) are also
established by Miller, Church, et al. (2009:14.8). Minimum assemblage thresholds for a recommendation
of NRHP eligibility exist (Miller, Church, et al. 2009:14.8â14.12) and generally call for samples of at least
30 artifacts of a class. The underlying premise is that sufficient quantities of artifacts must be present and
associated with a datable context before site information can be used to adequately address any Tier 2
research context.
The eligibility recommendations that are provided in this report include explicit recognition that significance determinations are not revealed through rigorous investigative methods. Significance is assigned
(Bruier and Mathers 1996; Leone and Potter 1992). Although seemingly self-evident, making the process
and implemented criteria of significance determinations explicit not only allows the determinations themselves to be critically evaluated but also opens the criteria and process of making determinations to critical
review and reevaluation in light of new information.

57

NRHP-Eligibility Thresholds
The material and information collected from a site must be placed within an unambiguous chronological
context and include demonstrable evidence that remaining cultural materials at the site are in a geomorphological context that has integrity. If these two conditions were met and the site in question demonstrably
contained data that could contribute to the investigation of one or more of the research domains presented
in Chapter 7, then SRI recommended the site eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d of
Title 3,6 Section 60.4, of the Code of Federal Regulations, with a full narrative of justification and
specific supporting documentation.
Conversely, SRI made an NRHP recommendation of not eligible if a site lacked chronological context
and/or geomorphic integrity and/or had inadequate potential to provide information relating to the research
domains included in the project POW (Vierra et al. 2008).

Site-Definition Standards
The Fort Bliss programmatic agreement (2007:4.4.1.2.3.2) provides general criteria for site definition.
These are:
â¢

The physical remains of past human activity that are at least 50 years old, and one of the following.

â¢

Ten or more artifacts of any class or type within an area 15 m in diameter, except when all pieces
appear to originate from a single source (e.g., one ceramic pot drop, one broken glass bottle, one
deteriorated piece of sheet metal, etc.). The exception is discrete, single knapping episodes, which
are treated as sites. FCR and burned caliche are not considered artifact types for purposes of this
criterion but may fall under the category of âundatable feature.â

â¢

One or more datable archaeological features with or without associated artifacts.

â¢

Two or more undatable archaeological features.

â¢

A single undatable feature with any associated artifacts. Ten pieces of FCR and/or burned caliche
2
in 1 m is the minimum criteria for FCR and/or burned caliche to be assigned feature status without
associated feature fill.

â¢

In general, 30 m will be the maximum distance between manifestations, beyond which the materials
should be treated as spatially unrelated.

Field personnel are allowed to exercise discretion in implementing these criteria, provided that there is
adequate justification for such action. The need for exercising discretion is most likely to arise when sites
from underrepresented time periods are encountered. As explained by Miller, Church, et al. (2009:14.12)
these include sites from the Paleoindian, Early Archaic, and Protohistoric periods. Rare finds such as these
may, in some circumstances, be considered sites without conforming to the Fort Bliss thresholds listed above.
However, as Miller, Church, et al. (2009:14.12) specify, rarity is not a consideration in eligibility evaluation.
The capacity of a site to provide information about history or prehistory provides the basis for evaluation.

Survey Methods
The 5,000-acre project area was completely covered during survey. Field personnel walked parallel lines
2
at 15-m intervals, ensuring coverage of each TRU, which are 15-m cells. The TRUs are defined by a grid
covering the entire project area. The origin for the project TRU grid is WGS84 E0371000 N3527000. For
58

the most part, walking was done in eastâwest lines. Coverage generally progressed from south to north within
the project area, although some shifts were made to accommodate activities at the Fort Bliss Gun and Rod
Club, as a large part of the project area is within their firing-range buffer. Schedules were coordinated to
avoid being in the firing-range buffer while the firing range was in use.
Two survey crews were always directed by crew chiefs and often also by assistant principal investigators.
Each crew member had a Trimble Juno Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver that also served as a
data-recording device. Devices contained a data-recording application designed specifically for use on Fort
Bliss. This application included a project TRU grid, previously recorded site polygons, and data-recording
screens. Additionally, at least one mapping-grade Trimble GPS receiver was with each crew. This instrument
was used to precisely record feature locations, collected artifact locations, and, during site recording, to
record subsurface-testing, photograph, and datum points.

Site-Recording Methods
Following completion of survey coverage, sites were defined using the survey data and in accordance with
the Fort Bliss site-definition criteria. Each site included at least one site-positive TRU. Site recording
included emplacing site-datum rebars with caps, taking site photographs, trowel testing all prehistoric
features, and completing site-recording forms.

The Provenience Designation Recording System
All recording was implemented using a PD system developed by SRI for comprehensive data recording and
management. Particularly with larger projects, systematically recording all of the many activities that occur
during fieldwork is complex. To efficiently deal with this challenge, SRI has developed an all-inclusive
recording system. The PD recording system synthesizes practically all aspects of field recording into one
series of numbers for the entire project; each number is given the PD prefix. PD numbers were assigned
to positive TRUs, features, subsurface tests, photographic points, site-datum locations, and collected artifacts. The PD system does not provide a consecutive series of numbers, as each recording instrument was
preassigned a block of 1,000 numbers to prevent duplication of used numbers. None of the blocks of
1,000 numbers were completely used.
An application that implements the PD recording system and is designed specifically for use on Fort
Bliss archaeological projects was included in all of the GPS receivers, which also served as digital datarecording devices. The application allows contextual, feature, and artifact data to be recorded at the TRU
level or point-plotted with the Trimble XH or XT, in the cases of features, collected artifacts, photo points,
and site datums. Contextual information includes recording site intactness, setting, and visibility. Artifact
information includes artifact classes, quantities, and types; material types; and comments. All of these data
are electronic and downloaded into a master database, the SRI relational database (SRID). Within this
database, the PD numbers provide unique identifiers for all data entries. Spatial data are downloaded for
processing in geographic information systems (GIS) applications.

Identifying Previously Recorded Sites
The project area includes 255 previously recorded archaeological sites that are completely or partially
within the project area. Information that was provided by Fort Bliss DPW-E to assist with relocating sites
included GIS data, Fort Bliss site records, and excerpts from previous reports that were provided as part
59

of site packets. This information proved valuable for both identifying and recording previously recorded
sites. When available, previous project reports also were referred to for additional information.
Typically, reported locations of previously known sites proved to be reliable, with less than 25 m of
tolerance. In many instances, previously recorded sites were relocated but recorded as positive TRUs rather than as sites, as they do not meet current Fort Bliss site-definition criteria. These former sites, listed in
Chapter 10, were evaluated and recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
A total of 124 previously recorded sites do not meet current Fort Bliss site definition criteria, because
of a paucity or lack of material. Based on previous records these were invariably small sites. A total of
131 previously recorded sites were relocated, including 87 that are now merged into other sites. Site mergers were determined in accordance with current site definition criteria. When previously recorded sites
were merged into larger sites, the lower Fort Bliss number was retained for the redefined site. Thirty-eight
previously recorded sites have been tested; 2 sites have been partially mitigated (FB 6273 [41EP1892]
and FB 6816 [41EP1953]) and 1 has been fully mitigated (FB 6831 [41EP1647]). The tested sites were
completely recorded during this survey. The portions of previous mitigated sites that remain as open excavations or recognizable previous excavations were not recorded.

Site Recording
Site recording was the final phase of project fieldwork. Each site, as defined by applying the Fort Bliss site
criteria to the survey data, was fully recorded. This included establishing a site datum comprised of a rebar
with a labeled metal cap, taking site-overview photographs, taking selective feature photographs, completing
paper site-recording forms, and, in almost all instances, trowel testing prehistoric features to determine whether they could be radiocarbon dated. Additionally, screened shovel tests were excavated at
times to better determine the spatial extent of sites. All excavations were completely backfilled. In the
many instances where site buffers overlapped, the intervening areas were resurveyed to verify the survey
data before finalizing site boundaries. Photographs of sites, features, and artifacts were taken as warranted.
Black-and-white images were taken, in both print and digital formats.

Isolated Occurrences
Isolated occurrences included positive TRUs that contained fewer than 10 artifacts, one feature that could
not be dated, or scattered FCR that did not constitute a feature. These occurrences were fully recorded, with
features point-provenienced.

Feature Recording
Features were defined following Fort Bliss feature-definition thresholds, which, in the case of FCR and
2
burned caliche, include the stipulation that there be at least 10 pieces within 1 m . Features were recorded
with the aforementioned SRI field-recording application. Length, width, and depth were recorded for features,
with length defined as the longest visible axis of the feature and width defined as the longest measurement
at a right angle to length. A distinction was made between FCR concentrations, defined as typically smaller
2
than 4 m and having less than ca. 200 pieces of FCR, and FCR middens, which usually were larger than
2
4 m , with more than ca. 200 pieces of FCR. All prehistoric features were trowel tested to determine integrity and the presence of subsurface cultural deposits.
60

Artifact Recording and Collection Strategies
Artifacts and descriptive information to provide a field analysis were also recorded in the recording application during systematic survey, to determine site contents and boundaries. Obtained information included
type and vessel form, in the case of ceramics, and reduction characteristics, modifications, and rock type,
in the case of flaked stone. Ground stone was recorded by category and rock type.
Artifacts were collected if obtained from an excavation (which happened in one instance), such as a
feature shovel test or trowel test, or if they could provide culturally or temporally diagnostic information
beyond that obtainable in the field. Collected artifacts were point-provenienced. With few exceptions,
collected artifacts are projectile points or fragments thereof. All other artifacts were analyzed in the field
using the SRI application for field recording.

Geomorphology Assessment
Investigating geomorphology was an integral part of this project that substantially contributed to overall
interpretations about site preservation, site location, and past human activity on the landscape. A geomorphologist participated in defining geomorphic settings of sites and associating them with previously
defined geomorphic units. Extensive hand augering was done and reported in detail (Chapter 3).

Postfield Analyses
All field and postfield analytical observations for samples and artifacts were entered into SRID. The projectile
points that were collected were fully analyzed, with attributes and metrics recorded in detail (Appendix G).
The few other artifacts recovered from this project were also fully analyzed. All collected artifacts, field
records, and photographs will be submitted to Fort Bliss upon completion of this project.

Introduction
As a result of this project, 99 sites are defined within the project area; 55 of these were newly discovered
and 44 were updates of previously recorded sites. Table 6 denotes the types of materials that were identified at each site in the project area. All tables associated with the sites described in this chapter are in
Microsoft Excel format and can be found on the CD-ROM included with this submission. Feature data,
including dimensions, contents, and depth can also be found on the CD.
Of the 99 sites present, 19 are recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP (Table 7), all under
Criterion d. The majority of the sites in the project area are prehistoric campsites, but a handful of prehistoric habitation sites and artifact scatters were also identified (see Table 7). Trowel testing was conducted
in the majority of the features to verify the presence or absence of subsurface deposits. The eligibility
determinations for these sites are based on three principal attributes, including the ability to contribute important information relevant to history or prehistory, the probability to yield chronometric dates, and contextual integrity. All of these sites satisfy the data requirements necessary to address the research domains
presented in Chapter 5. Eighty sites recorded in the project area are recommended not eligible for listing
in the NRHP, because they lack the characteristics listed above and thus include a minimal probability to
yield any additional significant information to address research questions.

Sites
The remainder of this chapter consists of descriptions of the sites documented during the survey. The cultural
resource findings are organized in this chapter by Fort Bliss site number (lowest to highest). Figures 11,
12, and 13 show the general location of the sites visited during the course of this project; they are organized
into northern, central, and southern portions of the project area, respectively.

FB 6273 (41EP1892)
Site Setting
FB 6273 is better known as Pueblo Sin Casas. It is situated in coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts in
the Hueco Bolson. Dunes are mature with thick, stabilizing vegetation and maximum heights exceeding
2 m. There are some interdunal areas with sand sheets, but most areas within the site are deflated down to
a Q3 surface. The interdunal areas with this exposed soil contain the cultural materials observed at FB 6273.
Some interdunal areas are eroded down to a caliche-rich alluvium that possibly is pre-Holocene. Vegetation

includes mesquite, fourwing saltbush, broom snakeweed, and members of the Asteracea family. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. The site is moderately disturbed by sheetwash
erosion, aeolian deflation and redeposition, and vehicle traffic. An estimated 51â75 percent of the site
remains intact.

Site Description
The site has a substantial history of investigation. FB 6273 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976
(Whalen 1978). As then defined, it contained at least nine fire-cracked-rock (FCR) features; El Paso Brown,
Bichrome, and Polychrome ceramics; Gila Polychrome; and âChihuahuanâ wares. It also contained flaked
stone debitage and tools and ground stone. Whalen (1978:116) described this site as a small El Paso phase
village with high excavation potential.
During 1979, Pueblo Sin Casas was excavated as part of a UTEP field school (Foster 1993), with the
expectation that El Paso phase rooms would be present. He reported 31 features from the site that were described as FCR concentrations, hearths or stains, and a sheet midden. The oldest of a variety of projectile
points dated from the Middle Archaic period (Foster 1993:32). Foster (1993:66) concluded that the site
was a deflated collection of occupations spanning millennia. No radiocarbon dates were obtained from
this project, which involved only a modest portion of FB 6273 as it is currently defined and did not include
an NRHP site evaluation.
The current survey extends the boundaries of FB 6273 through continuous artifacts and features that
now include previously recorded sites FB 7948, FB 7951, FB 8095, FB 8096, FB 11461, and FB 11469.
The first four of these sites were originally recorded by Whalen (1978) and the latter two by Lukowski
(1990a). FB 7948 contained three FCR features with an artifact scatter of flaked and ground stone (Whalen
1978:165). Whalen did not assign the site to a specific period or phase.
FB 7951 (41EP1891) was initially recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). The site contained
three FCR features, flaked stone tools and debitage, and ground stone. Undated FB 8095 was reported to
contain flaked stone, ground stone, and one hearth or roasting pit (Whalen 1978:168). Nearby FB 8096
was reported to have two thermal features and ground stone artifacts (Whalen 1978:168). Two sites now
included within FB 6273 were defined from Whalenâs (1978) survey data by Lukowski (1990a). The first
of these, FB 11461, included one FCR feature, El Paso brownware ceramics, and a metate. FB 11469
contained two FCR features and ground stone artifacts (Lukowski 1990a).
As currently recognized, FB 6273 includes 25 features and an associated artifact scatter covering an
2
area of 97,664 m in 153 positive TRUs (Figure 14). The features include 14 FCR/burned-caliche concentrations and 11 ash stains. Features and artifacts are dispersed across the site, although several clusters
of features exist. All the FCR/burned-caliche concentrations have suffered either a moderate or high degree
of disturbance, and the stains range from highly to minimally disturbed. Trowel testing established that
many of these features have deposits of approximately 5 cm in depth that potentially could provide radiocarbon samples. This includes the stains and four of the FCR/burned-caliche features. A substantial quantity of FCR is also scattered across the site.

Artifacts
The flaked stone tools observed at FB 6273 include retouched flakes, a uniface, and two projectile points.
Projectile points include a stemmed Late Archaic point and a contracting-stemmed later Middle Archaic
Langtry point (see Appendix G). The latter are widespread (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:225; Turner and
Hester 1999:143â144). Although not common on Fort Bliss, they have been found there previously (e.g.,
Carmichael 1986:303).As is typical of Hueco Bolson sites where Rio Grande gravels are exposed, flaked
stone tools are made from a variety of materials including limestone and chert. Ground stone items were
manufactured from basalt, granite, limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and unidentified igneous materials and
included manos, metates, and unidentifiable fragments. Recorded ceramic types included El Paso brownware, El Paso Polychrome, El Paso Bichrome, and unpainted plain ware.

Site Summary
FB 6273 is a multicomponent site composed of 25 features and a dense artifact scatter that includes a diverse
assortment of lithic and ceramic materials. The site is situated among large coppice dunes, with cultural
materials visible in interdunal blowouts. Nearly two-thirds of the features contain intact, potentially datable deposits. As originally suggested by Foster (1993) when referring to a much smaller incarnation of
FB 6273, this site is composed of numerous components, the earliest of which date from the Middle Archaic period. Although there has been disturbance to the site from many causes, including partial excavation, substantial portions of FB 6273 remain well preserved. The complexity of the assemblage attests to
the value of this location for exploitation over an extended period of time.
The site exhibits good integrity, with some relatively intact and datable features in conjunction with a
substantial assemblage with temporally and culturally diagnostic artifacts. These data could be used to address
various Archaic and Formative period research themes, including land use, site-formation processes, site
structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6273 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP,
under criterion d.

FB 6754 (41EP1852)
Site Setting
FB 6754 is located among 2-m-high coppice dunes. Extensive interdunal areas contain an exposed sandy
loam soil with lag gravels and, in some areas, exposed caliche. Vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, sand sage, and soaptree yucca. Surface visibility is estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. Sources
of disturbance include aeolian and alluvial erosion, bioturbation, military traffic, recent construction, and
modern debris. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 6754 was originally recorded in 1976 by UTEP (Whalen 1978:92). He described the site as a 1.5-ha
Mesilla phase village with no more than shallow deposits. The five features included three FCR concentrations and two stains. A light ceramic scatter was described with only El Paso brownware. Unspecified
quantities of flaked and ground stone were also found. A single undescribed projectile point was collected.
Based on the current survey data, six other previously recorded sites proved to be continuous with
FB 6754 and therefore all portions of one site, as specified by Fort Bliss site-definition criteria. The additional previously recorded sites are FB 7702, FB 7703, FB 7697, FB 12082, FB 12083, and FB 16727.
Three of these sites were recorded by Whalen (1978), and two others were subsequently defined from the
same survey data. FB 7697 contained a single FCR feature with flaked stone (Whalen 1978:160). FB 7702
was reported to contain two FCR features and flaked stone (Whalen 1978:160). Nearby FB 7703 included
two FCR features, flaked stone, and ground stone (Whalen 1978:160). None of these three aceramic sites
could be assigned a period or phase designation. Lukowski (1990a) defined FB 12082 as including two
FCR features, two stains, and a small flaked stone scatter, all recorded by Whalen during 1976. FB 12083
was composed of one stain with no associated artifacts. Lastly, FB 16727 (41EP5309) was recorded in
1996 by TRC. It was described as a sparse scatter of flaked stone, ground stone, ceramics, and scattered
FCR. No features were reported.
The much-expanded FB 6754 includes numerous features and associated artifacts scattered over an
2
area of 202,389 m and 245 positive TRUs (Figure 15). The site is irregularly shaped, with a linear band
of positive TRUs running eastâwest across the northern portion of the site. There is also a concentration
of materials located in the southeastern portion of the site that, when combined with the linear band, form
a loosely shaped arc. The 30 FCR/burned-caliche concentrations and ash stains range from high to low
73

degrees of impact. Trowel testing showed that nearly three-quarters of the features (n = 21) contain datable
organic stains and charcoal. These are features that have deposits up to 10 cm deep. This includes two of
the FCR/burned-caliche concentrations. Features are dispersed across the site. Scattered FCR was recorded
across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A moderate-density artifact scatter concentrated in several areas exists at FB 6754. Flaked stone artifacts were
composed of a variety of materials and included debitage, cores, a cobble uniface, tested cobbles, retouched
tools, various ground stone implements, and hammerstones. The three collected tools include a stemmed,
resharpened Late Archaic dart point; a stemmed Middle Archaic dart point; and a temporally nondiagnostic
drill (see Appendix G). The only recorded ceramic type was El Paso brownware. Historical-period artifacts
include a scatter of glass, metal cans, and an oil bottle.

Site Summary
FB 6754 is a multicomponent site composed of 30 features and an artifact scatter that contains several concentrations. Twenty-one features contain materials potentially suitable for absolute dating. These potentially
datable features are widely distributed across the site. Diagnostic projectile points provide evidence for
Middle and Late Archaic components, and El Paso brownware ceramics indicate a Formative period
component. Artifact counts are robust and include a variety of materials and artifact types.
The site exhibits good dating potential, evidence of intact deposits, and a substantial, diverse assemblage.
These data could be used to address various Archaic and Early Formative research themes, including land
use, site-formation processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6754 is therefore recommended
eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6773 (41EP1638)
Site Setting
FB 6773 is located on a slightly elevated area in coppice-dune terrain in the Hueco Bolson. The site overlooks a small fault-trough basin toward the north-northeast. Coppice dunes cover approximately 25 percent
of the site area. The interdunal areas contain some active sand sheets and exposed areas with lag caliche
nodules and gravels. Vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, sand sage, narrowleaf yucca, and
scarce forbs and grasses. Interdunal areas are almost devoid of vegetation. Disturbances include both
aeolian and fluvial erosion, bioturbation, and two maintained dirt roads. Modern debris is also present.
The site is 51â75 percent intact, with many features that remain well preserved.

Site Description
Eleven previously recorded sites were merged into one site during the course of the survey. The lowest
number, FB 6773 (41EP1638), was retained for the enlarged site. FB 6773 was initially recorded by Whalen
(1978:97), who described it as a Mesilla phase site with five stains (referred to as hearths) and a light
artifact scatter that included flaked stone, ground stone, and El Paso brownware.
The site was extensively tested during 2006 (Renn et al. 2008), via augering and backhoe excavation.
Renn et al. (2008) identified 15 features with over 600 artifacts and over 500 pieces of FCR. Based on
projectile points, ceramics, and radiocarbon dates, they concluded that the location of FB 6773 was initially
75

used during the Paleoindian period but repeatedly used into the historical period. Renn et al. (2008:56)
recommended the site eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.
Several of the previously recorded sites now merged into FB 6773 were initially reported by Whalen
(1978). Whalen (1978:113) described FB 6828 (41EP5929) as an El Paso phase site with no features and
a light artifact scatter. Ceramics included El Paso Polychrome, âMexican Polychrome,â and âCorrugated
ware.â Some ground stone and flaked stone items were found, including one dart point. FB 6828 was later
evaluated by Sale (2007); investigators found four stains, three artifact concentrations, and a more-diffuse
scatter of artifacts. They also found Casas Grandes polychrome that they suggest may be Villa Ahumada
Polychrome, El Paso Polychrome, and El Paso brownware. Notably, numerous sherds were found in
a shovel test into a Q3 soil. The site was recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.
FB 7905 (41EP1630) was also found by Whalen (1978:164). He reported the site to have two features
and flaked and ground stone items. He did not assign an affiliation to the site. The site was later evaluated
by Sale (2007), who reported four features and a small artifact concentration, primarily composed of flaked
stone. Based on ceramics, principal occupation was ascribed to the Late Formative period (Sale 2007:5â11).
The site was recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.
FB 7906 was originally recorded by Whalen (1978) during an inventory survey of portions of the western Hueco Bolson. It was reported to contain one thermal feature and a very light scatter of lithics and
brown ware. GMI visited the originally plotted location and found six FCR/burned caliche fragments in a
50-m-diameter area (Sale 2007:A-10). Because this site no longer meets current Fort Bliss site definition
criteria, Sale (2007:A-10) recommended it not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Whalen (1978:164) described FB 7912 (41EP1632) as containing two hearths and a very light artifact
scatter composed of a few sherds and some ground stone. He did not assign an affiliation to this site. Sale
(2007:A-11) evaluated this site and found three pieces of FCR within a 50-m radius of the reported site
location. The site was recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP, and it was suggested that it should be
reclassified as an isolated occurrence.
FB 7913 (41EP1637) had two hearths and a light scatter of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics
(Whalen 1978:165). An affiliation was not assigned for this site. The site was evaluated approximately
two decades later and proved to have three stains and a moderate number of artifacts (Sale 2007). The site
was dated to the Late Formative period, based on ceramics, and recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP,
under criterion d.
FB 9783 was originally recorded during a survey conducted for construction of Loop 375 (OâLaughlin 1987). The site was reported to contain a single stain feature, 25 brown ware sherds, and 10 lithic artifacts. The feature covered a 1-m-diameter area; 4 FCR fragments were noted. GMI revisited the plotted
location as part of Project 06-55 and found 13 brown ware sherds, 2 El Paso Polychrome sherds, and 1
fragment of FCR in a 30-m-diameter area (Sale 2007:A-13). The feature was not relocated. Because the
remaining assemblage does not meet current Fort Bliss site definition criteria, the site was recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
FB 9806 was originally recorded in 1986 during a survey associated with construction of Loop 375
(OâLaughlin 1987). It contained two charcoal stains, two FCR/burned-caliche concentrations, and a lowdensity scatter of flaked stone, ground stone, and FCR. No NRHP eligibility determination was made, but
additional work was recommended for the site. GMI revisited the site and found an extremely low-density
lithic scatter with two stain features. The lithic assemblage contained 15 items, and no ground stone artifacts, ceramics, or other temporally diagnostic artifacts were identified. The site was determined to be of
an unknown prehistoric temporal affiliation, but the overall technological signature reflects a Late Archaic or Early Formative period affiliation. For this reason, the site was recommended eligible for listing
in the NRHP under Criterion d (Sale 2007:5-24).
FB 11427 was originally recorded as an isolate by Whalen (1978). The location was later visited during a Fort Bliss in-house survey east of Loop 375 (Lukowski 1990b), but the feature was not found. GMI
revisited the site during Project 06-55 and found no cultural materials (Sale 2007:A-35). One feature was
identified approximately 50 m south of the plotted location that may have been the original feature identified by Whalen (1978), but it lacks associated artifacts and/or datable deposits. Because the originally
76

plotted location includes no cultural materials and therefore does not meet current Fort Bliss site-definition criteria, Sale (2007) recommended it not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
FB 11435 was originally recorded as an isolate in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It was reevaluated by Fort
Bliss staff (Lukowski 1990b), who identified a stain feature, two ground stone fragments, and a shell
bead. No eligibility determination was made. GMI revisited the site as part of Project 06-55 (Sale 2007)
and found one FCR feature with charcoal staining and three pieces of flaked stone. Although the feature
may have included datable deposits, the lack of a substantial associated assemblage precluded addressing
pertinent research questions, and the site was therefore recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP
(Sale 2007:5-37).
One of the sites now merged into FB 6773 was recorded during a Fort Bliss survey for a tank trail in
1990 (Lukowski 1990b). FB 12153 was originally reported to include only a small quantity of flaked stone,
ground stone, and burned caliche. No features were located. The site was revisited during an evaluation
project (Sale 2007) that located a single piece of flaked stone and determined that the location did not
meet Fort Bliss site-eligibility criteria.
2
As redefined through site mergers and new survey data, FB 6773 covers an area of 244,678 m and includes 298 positive TRUs (Figure 16). This site contains 45 features, a total that includes 35 stains in various
states of preservation, 8 FCR/burned-caliche concentrations, and 2 large stains that are possibly structures. The 2 possible structures are separated by a distance of approximately 560 m. Features are extensively
distributed across the site, although there are more in the southern portion of the site, and there are several
groups of 2â3 features in close proximity to each other. As determined by trowel testing, 37 of the features, including the possible structures, contain charcoal flecking or charred organic material. Scattered
FCR was also observed across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
FB 6773 contains a high-density artifact scatter spread over a large area. Ceramic types observed during
this survey include all of the El Paso series, including one El Paso Polychrome sherd with texturing,
Chupadero Black-on-white, Mimbres Black-on-white, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, and Seco Corrugated.
Ceramics span the length of the Formative period.
Flaked stone items include abundant angular debris, cores, a cobble biface, cobble unifaces, tested
cobbles, retouched tools including five collected projectile points, and an assortment of ground stone and
hammerstones. Projectile points include four Late Archaic stemmed points and a Late Archaic contractingstemmed Lerma point (see Appendix G). As with other classes of artifacts, ground stone is widely distributed
across the site. All diagnostic flaked stone artifacts indicate a Late Archaic period component for the site.
A small number of historical-period artifacts were recorded. Items include several unidentified suncolored amethyst (SCA) glass shards and a bottle with a makerâs mark used by the Thatcher Manufacturing Company from the early 1900s through the 1940s (Toulouse 1971:496).

Site Summary
FB 6773 represents the accumulation of multiple occupations distributed over a very large area. The site
exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity and is situated on top of an elevated location with a clear
view of the surrounding terrain. Two large stains may be structures, and the substantial, diverse assemblage is indicative of residential occupation(s). Forty-five features were identified, including stains and
FCR/burned-rock concentrations. Nearly 85 percent of the features contain potentially datable materials.
Although many of the features are situated in the southern portion of the site, there are groups of 2â3 features present in several areas. The abundance and nature of the features suggest that FB 6773 was used as
a residential site and temporary campsite. The artifact assemblage contains a diverse array of flaked stone,

ground stone, and ceramic items. Artifacts, the oldest of which may date to the Paleoindian (Renn et al.
2008) or Early Archaic period (Sale 2007), provide evidence of a long and complex occupational history
on this landform. In summary, the site exhibits geomorphic integrity, can be absolutely and relatively
dated, contains a diverse assemblage, and may reflect both residential and seasonal use of the area. Data
from this site could be used to address various Archaic and Formative research themes, including land
use, site-formation processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology. Therefore, FB 6773 is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6774 (41EP1867)
Site Setting
This site is located along a low ridge in coppice-dune terrain in the Hueco Bolson. The site occupies a
large area along this ridge. Dunes in the area are up to 3 m high, with heavily eroded interdunal areas
between the dunes. Interdunal surfaces include thin sand sheets, an exposed Q3 sandy loam, and exposed
caliche. Vegetation is composed of mesquite, broom snakeweed, sand sage, and soaptree yucca. Overall
surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A moderate degree of modern erosion
and deflation has impacted the site. Sources of disturbance include alluvial erosion, aeolian deflation and
redeposition, bioturbation, military debris, construction, and heavy vehicle traffic. An estimated 26â
51 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
The boundaries of FB 6774 were significantly expanded by the current survey, with the site now incorporating previously recorded sites FB 6775, FB 6814, FB 6835, FB 7706, FB 7707, FB 7713, FB 7714,
FB 7715, FB 7716, FB 7940, FB 7941, FB 7942, FB 7943, FB 7944, FB 8076, FB 11451, FB 11459,
FB 11460, FB 11465, and FB 12078. FB 6774 was originally recorded in 1976 (Whalen 1978:97â98), as
were most of the 15 sites now merged into FB 6774. He characterized the site as a small Mesilla village
1
that was almost /2 ha in size. The site contained 5 FCR features, 1 small stain, and an artifact assemblage
with El Paso brownware, flaked stone, and ground stone. FB 6775 (41EP1879) contained at least 22 features
and an associated concentration of flaked stone, ground stone, and a light scatter of El Paso brownware
sherds. The site was described as a Mesilla phase village with high excavation potential. Whalen (1978:109)
reported FB 6814 (41EP1362) to be an El Paso phase camp with a light scatter of ceramics including El Paso
Polychrome, flaked stone, and ground stone items. He (1978:115) described nearby FB 6835 (41EP1882)
as an El Paso phase village that contained 4 FCR features and 7 small stains. Modest quantities of El Paso
Polychrome ceramics, flaked stone tools and debitage, and ground stone were present. FB 7707 (41EP1861)
contained 1 FCR feature and flaked and ground stone items (Whalen 1978:160). This aceramic site could
not be relatively dated. Whalen (1978:160) reported that FB 7713 (41EP1859) contained 1 FCR feature,
El Paso brownware ceramics, flaked stone, and ground stone, all in small quantities. Whalen (1978:160)
reported FB 7714 (41EP1863) to include 1 FCR feature and an artifact assemblage of flaked stone and
ground stone. FB 7715 (41EP1864) was described as a small site of unknown age and affiliation that contained
1 FCR feature with deposits, no ceramics, and some flaked stone (Whalen 1978:160). FB 7716 (41EP1878)
was reported by Whalen (1978:160) to contain a scatter of El Paso brownware, flaked stone, and ground
stone. The site was revisited by UTEP in 1997 (Lukowski 1997:C-11). The site contained only small quantities of FCR, burned caliche, and flaked stone. Whalen (1978:165) described FB 7940 (41EP1865) as a
scatter of flaked stone and ground stone of unknown age and affiliation. Nearby, undated FB 7941 (41EP1866)
had 1 FCR feature and an assemblage of flaked stone and ground stone (Whalen 1978:165). Whalen
(1978:160) described FB 7942 (41EP1881) as having 1 FCR feature and a scatter of flaked stone and ground

79

stone. FB 7943 (41EP1876) also was originally recorded by UTEP in 1977 (Whalen 1978:165). It contained
1 FCR feature and a scatter of El Paso brownware ceramics and flaked stone. FB 7944 (41EP1880) had
2 FCR features, flaked stone, and ground stone items (Whalen 1978:165). The site was revisited during a
1997 UTEP project. Lukowski (1997:C-14) reported 1 stain and a small number of flaked stone artifacts.
He (1997:G-10) recommended the site not eligible for listing in the NRHP. FB 8076 (41EP1877) was
another small, flaked and ground stone scatter recorded by Whalen (1978:168).
Several sites that were amalgamated into FB 6774 were defined by Lukowski (1990a) based on Whalenâs
1976 survey data. These include FB 11451, which consists of one FCR feature. FB 11459 was listed as
having one FCR feature, a scatter of El Paso brownware, and flaked stone artifacts (Lukowski 1990a).
FB 11460 contained one FCR feature and flaked stone items (Lukowski 1997). FB 11465 included only
one FCR feature with no associated artifacts (Lukowski 1997). Lastly, FB 12078 contained one FCR
feature (Lukowski 1990a).
As redefined to comply with Fort Bliss site-definition criteria, FB 6774 now includes 111 thermal features
2
and an artifact scatter covering an area of 376,021 m and including 451 positive TRUs (Figure 17). The
features include 18 FCR/burned-caliche concentrations and 93 stains defined by dark fill. The preservation of features varies, ranging from low to high degrees of modern impact. The majority of these features
(n = 99), including 6 FCR/burned-caliche concentrations, contain intact deposits that are up to 10 cm deep,
as established by trowel testing. Radiocarbon-dating potential for the site is excellent. These features are
spread out over a large area, and many small clusters of features are discernable (Figure 18). It is highly
probable that the site is an accretion of cultural activity over a long period of time. Scattered FCR was
also observed across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
The artifact assemblage from FB 6774 includes close to 1,000 artifacts that are unevenly distributed over a
large area. More than 500 pieces of flaked stone were found and include relatively large quantities of basalt,
chert, obsidian, and rhyolite. The flaked stone assemblage is dominated by flakes and flake fragments,
although cores and tools were also found. No projectile points were located at FB 6774 during this survey.
Much of the ground stone is fragmentary and limestone or sandstone. Limestone is the most abundant
variety of FCR at FB 6774. Almost all of the ceramics are El Paso brownware, although some El Paso
Polychrome and Chupadero Black-on-white sherds were seen. These types indicate that, minimally, the
site was occupied during the later part of the Formative period, if not during the entire Formative period.
Recorded historical-period artifacts include white-bodied earthenware sherds, glass shards, various metal
artifacts, and ammunition boxes.

Site Summary
FB 6774 is an extensive, multicomponent site with over 100 features, a substantial artifact scatter, and a
sparse historical-period artifact scatter. The site has been substantially disturbed, although the presence of
numerous ash stains and burned-rock features attest to the partial integrity of the area. There are many small
clusters of features that could reflect discrete activity areas or separate occupations. A total of 99 features
remain sufficiently intact to contain ash/charcoal. The Q3 sand that is discontinuously present can be expected to contain preserved cultural deposits. Approximately 1,000 artifacts were recorded, including a
range of lithics and ceramics. Lastly, a few historical-period artifacts were also identified. The site exhibits
good geomorphic integrity, can be absolutely and relatively dated, contains a diverse assemblage, and
could contain Formative period habitation structures and spatially distinct feature clusters. These data
could be used to address various EarlyâLate Formative research themes, including land use, site-formation
processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology. The site is therefore recommended eligible for
listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6776 (41EP1645)
Site Setting
1

FB 6776 is located in coppice-dune terrain in the Hueco Bolson and was originally recorded as less than /2 ha
in size (Whalen 1978:98). The site is located on a slight rise that slopes toward the northeast. Dunes are
up to 3 m high and cover approximately one-quarter of the site area. Interdunal areas include aeolian sands
with carbonate nodules and pebbles. Vegetation, which is almost confined to the stabilized dunes, includes
mesquite, broom snakeweed, fourwing saltbush, and some forbs and grasses. The site is considered to be
76â99 percent intact, although there is some disturbance from aeolian and water erosion. A regularly used,
unpaved road passes by the west edge of the site, and there is a small amount of modern trash scattered
across the site. Ground visibility is largely unimpeded.

Site Description
This site was initially recorded by Whalen (1978:98) as a Mesilla phase village that included six features
and artifacts near a playa. Deposits were estimated to be less than 10 cm deep. This site subsequently was
evaluated by Lukowski (1997:C-7), who reported three features, plain ware sherds, modest amounts of
flaked and ground stone, and almost 150 pieces of FCR. Lukowski (1997:93) recommended the site not
eligible for listing in the NRHP.
FB 7953, which is now merged into FB 6776, was also first recorded by Whalen (1978:165) and
subsequently evaluated by Lukowski (1997). Whalen (1978:165) reported the site as an artifact scatter composed of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics but without features. Lukowski (1997:C-14) subsequently

82

identified two features, one sherd, and small quantities of flaked and ground stone. He recommended the
site not eligible for listing in the NRHP (Lukowski 1997:93).
2
The expanded site includes numerous features and an artifact scatter covering an area of 49,210 m in
66 positive TRUs (Figure 19). Features are distributed over much of the site, although most are loosely
concentrated in the central area. The features include 23 stains and an FCR/burned-caliche concentration.
Whereas the stains all contain intact datable deposits, the FCR feature did not. The features are disturbed
to varying degrees, with 8 remaining well preserved. Trowel testing demonstrated that the features have
deposits up to 10 cm deep.

Artifacts
FB 6776 contains a moderately dense artifact scatter with lithics and ceramics. Flaked stone includes debitage, cores, retouched tools, and one hammerstone, most of which are manufactured from chert. The modest
quantity of ceramics includes El Paso Polychrome and El Paso brownware sherds. The few ground stone
artifacts are made from a variety of material types. Some FCR that was not associated with features was
recorded and is distributed across the site.

Site Summary
FB 6776 is composed of an artifact scatter and 24 features. Although the site is situated within an interdunal
setting, it appears to exhibit good geomorphic integrity. The features consist of 23 stains and 1 burned-rock
cluster that are distributed across the site. The FCR feature is the only feature at the site that does not contain potentially datable deposits. At least 1 of the stains contained visible pieces of large charcoal. There
is a substantial and diverse assemblage of lithic and ceramic artifacts, including El Paso Polychrome sherds.
These data could be used to address Late Formative research themes, including land use, the logistic exploitation of basin settings, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6776 is therefore recommended
eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6778 (41EP1925)
Site Setting
FB 6778 is situated among coppice dunes that sit along a low ridge running southwestânortheast. Surface
sediments are characterized by shallow aeolian deposits of fine sand that overlay a fine sandy loam soil
visible in deflated interdunal blowouts. Also visible in interdunal blowouts are carbonate nodules and lag
gravels. The local vegetation community is dominated by mesquite, with broom snakeweed and fourwing
saltbush also present. Surface visibility is estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. A low degree of modern
erosion and deflation has impacted the site. Sources of disturbance include aeolian erosion, water erosion,
and military surface debris. An estimated 76â99 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 6778 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). The site was reported to have four FCR
features, El Paso Brown and brownware ceramics, flaked stone, and ground stone. The current survey expanded the boundaries of FB 6778, which now includes previously recorded sites FB 7967, FB 11476,
and FB 11480. FB 7967 was initially recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It contained six FCR
features, El Paso brownware ceramics, flaked stone tools and debitage, and ground stone. FB 11476 was
83

Figure 19. Site map of FB 6776.

84

recorded by Directorate of Environment (DOE) personnel in 1994 and consisted of a scatter of flaked and
ground stone (Lukowski 1997). FB 11480 was originally recorded on the same DOE survey in 1994 and
reportedly contained one FCR feature and ground stone.
Presently, FB 6778 consists of 13 thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area
2
of 59,122 m and including 79 positive TRUs (Figure 20). The thermal features include 5 FCR/burnedcaliche concentrations and 8 ash stains. These features range from high to low in disturbance. As determined by trowel testing, 9 of the features are reported to contain datable deposits that are up to 10 cm deep;
the site possesses good chronometric potential. Scattered FCR is also present across much of the site surface. Features occur in two apparent clusters, one at the northeast corner of the site and the other at the
southwest corner. These areas are separated by approximately 100 m, though scattered FCR and artifacts are
located between the feature clusters. The two clusters probably represent discrete activity areas or separate
occupations of the site.

Artifacts
A high-density artifact scatter containing lithics and ceramics was recorded at FB 6778. Lithic artifacts
are composed of a variety of materials and include debitage, cores, tested cobbles, retouched tools, and
ground stone. Retouched tools include bifaces, unifaces, scrapers, a retouched flake, and a projectile
point. The projectile point is a stemmed Late Archaic point (see Appendix G). Recorded ceramics included
El Paso brownware and an El Paso Brown rim. El Paso Brown ceramics suggest an EarlyâMiddle Formative period component.

Site Summary
FB 6778 is a multicomponent site composed of 13 features and a dense and diverse artifact scatter. Indeed,
artifact diversity is impressive with a number of formal tools identified. Although the site is situated among
coppice dunes and eroded interdunal blowouts, it does retain a high degree of integrity. The features consist
of ash stains and burned-rock clusters, with at least nine of these being sufficiently intact to contain datable materials. Two clusters of features are present in the northeastern and southwestern sections of the
site and may represent discrete activity areas or separate occupations. These data could be used to address
EarlyâMiddle Formative research themes, including land use, site structure, subsistence, and technology.
FB 6778 is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6816 (41EP1953)
Site Setting
FB 6816 is situated amid coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts. Dunes are capped by mesquite, and
interdunal blowouts have surface sediments consisting of loose blowsand and lag gravels overlying Q3
compact sandy loam. The Q3 rests on top of caliche mixed with silty sand. A shovel test excavated into
the edge of a dune revealed the Q3 buried soil with charcoal mixed into this stratigraphy. Vegetation is
dominated by mesquite, with lesser numbers of broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. A moderate degree of aeolian deflation and alluvial
erosion has impacted the site, and military surface debris is present. An estimated 26â50 percent of
the site remains intact.

85

Figure 20. Site map of FB 6778.

86

Site Description
FB 6816 has been expanded through the recording of continuous artifacts and features to encompass
previously recorded sites FB 7734 (41EP1952), FB 7736 (41EP1951), FB 7737 (41EP1949), FB 7738
(41EP1950), FB 7739 (41EP1948), and FB 7740.
FB 7734 was initially recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It was reported to contain a very
light scatter of flaked stone and one FCR feature. The site was revisited by UTEP in 1997, at which point
it was described as containing a scatter of FCR, flaked stone, and ground stone (Lukowski n.d.). Recorders
noted that the FCR concentration originally recorded as a feature in 1976 had been destroyed by military
activity.
FB 7736 was initially recorded on the same 1976 UTEP survey. It was reported to contain one FCR
feature and an artifact scatter consisting of flaked stone and ground stone (Whalen 1978). The site was
revisited by UTEP in 1997, at which point it was described as containing six thermal features and a scatter
of FCR, flaked stone, and cores (Lukowski n.d.).
FB 7737 was initially recorded by UTEP in 1976. It contained two FCR features and a very light artifact
scatter composed of El Paso brownware ceramics, flaked stone, and ground stone (Whalen 1978).
FB 7738 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976, when it was described as consisting of one FCR
feature and a scatter of flaked stone and ground stone (Whalen 1978). The site was revisited by UTEP in
1997, when recorders noted a scatter of ground stone, burned caliche, flaked stone, hammerstone spall, and
no features (Lukowski n.d.).
FB 7739 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976. It contained five FCR features and a very light artifact scatter of El Paso brownware, flaked stone, and ground stone (Whalen 1978).
FB 7740 was initially recorded by UTEP in 1976. It contained one FCR feature and a scatter of flaked
stone and ground stone (Whalen 1978). The site was revisited by UTEP in 1997, when it was described as
three thermal features and a scatter of ground stone and FCR/burned caliche (Lukowski n.d.).
Currently, FB 6816 consists of 14 thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area
2
of 78,224 m in 109 positive TRUs (Figure 21). The features include one dozen dark stains up to ca. 10 cm
deep and 2 FCR/burned-caliche concentrations. All of these features contain deposits, and 4 had charcoal
flecks observable during trowel tests. Additionally, a shovel test (14668) excavated into Q3 deposits on the
edge of a dune revealed macrobotanical charcoal in the compact sandy loam soil underlying recent blowsands. The site possesses excellent chronometric potential. The site is spread over a large area, with a
cluster of features and artifacts in the north half of the site and a diffuse scatter of artifacts and features in
the southern half. The clusters may represent discrete activity areas or separate occupations.

Artifacts
A high-density artifact scatter was recorded at FB 6816, composed of lithic and ceramic artifacts. Lithic artifacts are composed of a variety of materials and include debitage, cores, a cobble biface, a tested cobble,
retouched tools, and ground stone. Retouched tools consisted of bifaces, projectile points, retouched flakes,
and a scraper. One projectile point is a serrated Late Archaic point with a stemmed, concave base. The
other is a Middle Archaic, contracting-stemmed Langtry point (see Appendix G). Recorded ceramic types
include El Paso brownware, Chupadero Black-on-white, and an unidentified plain ware. The projectile
points indicate both Middle and Late Archaic period components. The presence of Chupadero Black-onwhite suggests a MiddleâLate Formative period component for the site. A 1936 U.S. penny was also
found at this site.

Site Summary
FB 6816 is a multicomponent site consisting of 14 thermal features and a high-density artifact scatter. Although the site is situated among coppice dunes and deflated interdunal blowouts, it appears to exhibit a
fair degree of geomorphic integrity. Notably, charcoal deposits were exposed in a shovel test below surface sands, underscoring the good potential for cultural deposits at FB 6816. The site possesses excellent
chronometric potential, with all of the features containing intact datable deposits. There is a cluster of features situated in the northern area, with a diffuse scatter present in the southern section. These clusters may
represent discrete activity areas or separate occupations. The artifact assemblage is diverse, with a large
number of items distributed across the site. Lithic artifacts are composed of various materials and include
formal tools and diagnostic artifacts from both the Middle and Late Archaic period. Diagnostic ceramics
were also identified, dating from the MiddleâLate Formative period. These data could be used to address
MiddleâLate Archaic and MiddleâLate Formative research themes, including land use, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6816 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6823 (41EP1622)
Site Setting
FB 6823 is situated in a coppice-dune field less than 100 m northwest of Loop 375. Dunes cover approximately 35 percent of this site. Surface sediments are loose sand, with lag gravels present in interdunal
blowouts. The dunes cap a sandy loam soil. Vegetation includes mesquite, sand sage, and broom snakeweed and is located almost exclusively atop dunes. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and
75 percent. A moderate degree of modern erosion and deflation has impacted the site. Sources of disturbance
include aeolian and water erosion, bioturbation, and military traffic. A large road runs northâsouth on the
eastern edge of the site, and a smaller road intersects with this road on the southern boundary. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 6823 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 as part of the Loop 375 project (OâLaughlin et al.
1988). It contained a low-density scatter of flaked stone and ceramics. Lone Mountain Archaeological
Services (LMAS) archaeologists returned to the site in 2001 and documented one thermal feature, along
with a sparse, site-wide scatter of burned caliche, flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics (Church and
Stowe 2006:I-145). The ceramics included El Paso Polychrome. The site was recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP (Church and Stowe 2006:I-148). The current survey extended the boundaries of
FB 6823, which now includes several other previously recorded sites, including FB 7903 and FB 9805.
Currently, FB 6823 consists of two thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area
2
of 16,049 m in 19 positive TRUs (Figure 22). The features are a highly disturbed FCR/burned-caliche
concentration without deposits and a moderately impacted stain with 5 cm of dark fill that contains ash
and charcoal, as determined by trowel testing. FCR is scattered across the site.

Artifacts
A high-density artifact scatter composed of flaked stone, one piece of ground stone, and ceramics was
recorded at FB 6823. More than two dozen pieces of flaked stone were recorded, much of which is chert.
A granite mano fragment was the only ground stone item observed. Recorded ceramic types include El Paso

decorated, El Paso brownware, Chupadero Black-on-white, Lincoln Black-on-red, El Paso Polychrome,
and Seco Corrugated. These ceramic types indicate a Late Formative period component for the site. There
are also several dozen pieces of FCR scattered across the surface of the site.

Site Summary
FB 6823 is a Late Formative period temporary campsite consisting of a disturbed burned-rock feature, an
intact ash stain, and an associated artifact scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity and is situated
in a coppice-dune field, with artifacts and features visible in eroded interdunal blowouts. Only one of the
two features is intact and has the potential to yield datable materials. Numerous lithic and ceramic artifacts
were observed, most of which consist of debitage with some sherds that date to the Late Formative period.
Overall, the site contains only limited dating potential, a small assemblage, and poor integrity. Therefore,
FB 6823 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 6824 (41EP1623)
FB 6824 was originally recorded during Whalenâs (1977) survey project in Maneuver Areas 1 and 2; he
documented a small campsite with a light artifact scatter and no thermal features. The site was visited
again by UTEP in 1990, as part of the Loop 375 project (OâLaughlin 1987). At that time, it consisted of
one thermal feature and a sparse artifact scatter. Polychromes were identified, which suggested an El Paso
phase occupation.
LMAS returned to the site in 2001 and described one thermal feature and a scatter of almost 700 flaked
stone, ground stone, and ceramic artifacts, including El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-white, and
possible Chihuahuan wares (Church and Stowe 2006). Disturbances to the site at that time included alluvial
and aeolian erosion, vehicle traffic, and the construction of Loop 375. Only 25 percent of the site remained
intact during the LMAS visit. Ten trowel tests were placed in and around the lone feature, but no subsurface cultural materials were identified. Despite the fact that no subsurface materials were encountered, the
density and diversity of the artifact assemblage and the potential for buried deposits, based on the presence of deep aeolian sediments, led LMAS to recommend the site eligible for listing in the NRHP, under
criterion d (Church and Stowe 2006:I-148).
In 2008, data-recovery efforts were undertaken by TRC at FB 6824 (Project 07-45). Forty-three backhoe
trenches were excavated across the site (Condon et al. 2009). Thirty-six features were identified and included
FCR concentrations, stains, a rectangular pit house, a collared hearth, a midden, 2 surface rooms, and
2 trash pits. Six excavation units, ranging from 2 by 2 m to 8 by 13 m, were excavated around the features. Over 9,000 artifacts, most of which were diagnostic ceramics, were recovered during the data-recovery process. The site was assigned a primary El Paso phase component based on radiocarbon ages
spanning cal. A.D. 1280â1420 (Condon et al. 2009:191). Diagnostic ceramics (El Paso Brown, Alma Plain,
Jornada Brown, and Mimbres Black-on-white) suggest an Early Formative period component (A.D. 200â
1100) is also present.
SRI revisited FB 6824 during the survey and recorded a total of 14 positive TRUs, all completely or
partially within the previous site boundary (Figure 23). One highly disturbed ash stain was identified,
along with over 200 ceramic and flaked stone artifacts. El Paso brownware, El Paso Brown, El Paso
Decorated, and Lincoln Black-on-red ceramics were identified. Fifteen pieces of debitage and 1 retouched
piece of chert composed the lithic assemblage. FB 6824 has been mitigated through data recovery.

FB 6829 (41EP1640)
Site Setting
FB 6829 is located in the southwestern portion of the project area, within 500 m of Loop 375. The site is on
a slight rise in coppice-dune terrain, with interdunal sand sheets that contain some lag gravels. Approximately
40 percent of the site area is composed of coppice dunes that are up to 3 m high. The land generally dips
toward the northeast. Vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, fourwing saltbush, Torrey yucca,
and sundry forbs and grasses. The site has been subjected to aeolian and water erosion that had led to
some deflation, and there is also minor disturbance from military activities. The site is estimated to be between
51 and 75 percent intact, and ground visibility is generally unhindered.

Site Description
This site includes two previously recorded sites, which are FB 6829 (41EP1640) and FB 6830 (41EP1641).
Original areas for these two previously recorded sites compose approximately 40 percent of the area of
FB 6829. Both sites were first recorded by Whalen (1978) and subsequently by LMAS in 2006 (Project 0276). Whalen (1978:113) described FB 6829 as an El Paso phase site that contained up to five hearths, a
light scatter of ceramics that included some El Paso polychrome, and assorted stone artifacts. FB 6830
was similarly described, although with the addition of âMexican Polychromeâ (Whalen 1978:113â114).
Both sites were reported to have low excavation potential.
FB 6829 was revisited in 2007 by LMAS (Renn et al. 2008). They expanded the site to include seven
2
features over an area of almost 17,000 m . Mesquite from one feature was radiocarbon dated to cal. A.D. 1310â
1345 (Renn et al. 2008:52). LMAS concurred with the original assignment of this site to the El Paso phase
and recommend it eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Results of the current survey indicate an appreciably larger site, with the inclusion of FB 6830 and
added area caused by numerous positive TRUs outside the original site boundaries. Currently, the site
2
contains eight thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of 77,233 m in 114 positive TRUs (Figure 24). The features consist of six stains and two FCR concentrations. Six of the features
have intact charcoal-stained deposits and therefore some potential for radiocarbon dating. Feature fill is up
to 10 cm deep, based on trowel-testing results. The features are widely distributed across the site, including isolated pieces of FCR.

Artifacts
A high-density artifact scatter was recorded at FB 6829, consisting of lithic and ceramic artifacts. Flaked
stone from FB 6829 includes debitage, cores, and retouched tools, including retouched flakes, a uniface,
and a biface made of a variety of materials. One hammerstone was also recorded. Ground stone includes
mano fragments and indeterminate fragments. Identified ceramic types include El Paso Polychrome,
Chupadero Black-on-white, and Mimbres Black-on-white. Two .30-carbine casings dating from 1943
were also observed.

Site Summary
FB 6829 consists of eight features and numerous lithic and ceramic artifacts. The site is situated on a slight
rise within a coppice-dune setting. Most of the site exhibits good contextual integrity, including six wellpreserved features that have the potential to yield datable materials. A single mesquite-charcoal sample has
already provided a calibrated date of A.D. 1310â1345 (Renn et al. 2008:52). This date corresponds with the

presence of El Paso Polychrome, although Mimbres Black-on-white sherds at the site presumably reflect
an earlier occupation. The assemblage contains a diverse suite of lithic and ceramic artifacts that probably reflect the remains of multiple EarlyâLate Formative period campsites. These data could be used to
address EarlyâLate Formative research themes, including land use, logistic use of the basin, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6829 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP,
under criterion d.

FB 6831 (41EP1647)
FB 6831 was mitigated by LMAS in 2002 (Church et al. 2007). The site was originally identified by Whalen
(1978) and subsequently revisited by Lukowski and Stuart (1996). It was situated within an interdunal
blowout and consisted of 3 FCR concentrations, 2 stains, and an associated lithic and ceramic scatter. The
site was attributed to the Early Formative period based on the presence of approximately 30 El Paso brownware sherds and a single El Paso Brown sherd. A total of 27 features were excavated during the LMAS datarecovery program. These consisted of 12 FCR concentrations, 12 stains, a bell-shaped pit, and 2 structures.
The structures consist of simple basin-shaped features that were 2â3 m in diameter and filled with charcoalstained soil. Three radiocarbon dates were obtained from a thermal feature, the bell-shaped pit, and a structure
and yielded calibrated intercepts of A.D. 530, 580, and 770, respectively. The site is a palimpsest that
includes both residential and logistical Early Formative site occupations.
SRI revisited the site during the survey and recorded a total of 24 positive TRUs (Figure 25). Nonetheless, FB 6831 has been mitigated and therefore requires no further evaluation.

FB 6832 (41EP1672)
Site Setting
FB 6832 is situated among 1â2-m-high coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts (Figure 26). Surface
sediments are characterized by loose blowsands. Exposed lag and caliche gravels are visible in deflated
interdunal blowouts, along with the Q3 compact soil. Vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed,
sand sage, soaptree yucca, and Mormon tea. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent.
A moderate degree of modern erosion and deflation has impacted the site. Sources of disturbance include
aeolian deflation, alluvial erosion, bioturbation, military debris, and vehicle traffic. An estimated 26â
50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
The current survey finds that FB 6832 consists of a single thermal feature and an associated artifact scatter
2
covering an area of 58,942 m in 32 positive TRUs (Figure 27). The thermal feature is a highly disturbed ash
stain that contained charcoal to a depth of 5 cm. A low-density scatter of FCR and artifacts is distributed across the surface of the site. The site presumably is the result of multiple ephemeral occupations
in conjunction with the effects of the natural erosion processes.

Artifacts
A moderately dense artifact scatter consisting of lithic and ceramic artifacts was recorded. Lithic artifacts
were composed of a variety of materials and included debitage, a chert core, a granite hammerstone, and
various ground stone items. Identified ceramic types include El Paso brownware, El Paso decorated, El Paso

Figure 26. Overview photograph of FB 6832.

Polychrome, El Paso Brown, and Seco Corrugated. El Paso Polychrome and Seco Corrugated suggest a
Late Formative period component for the site.

Site Summary
FB 6832 consists of a single ash stain with associated artifacts. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity
and is situated among coppice dunes, with cultural materials exposed in deflated interdunal blowouts. Artifacts are distributed evenly across the site. A single ash stain is highly disturbed and has little potential to
yield datable materials. Although lithic artifact counts are low, there is a variety of Late Formative ceramic
types represented. FB 6832 is substantially disturbed and contains little data potential for addressing any research domains. It is therefore recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 6836 (41EP1894)
Site Setting
FB 6836 is situated amid coppice dunes and interdunal areas. Surface sediments include loose blowsands
underlain by the Q3 soil that is exposed in blowouts. Carbonate nodules and lag gravels are visible in the
eroded interdunal areas. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with lesser numbers of broom snakeweed,
fourwing saltbush, sand sage, and various forbs/grasses. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51
and 75 percent. A moderate degree of aeolian and alluvial erosion has impacted the site. An estimated 51â
75 percent of the site remains intact.

97

Figure 27. Site map of FB 6832.

98

Site Description
FB 6836 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It consisted of four FCR features,
El Paso Polychrome ceramics, flaked stone, and ground stone. Presently, the site consists only of a low2
density scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts covering an area of 11,207 m in 18 positive TRUs (Figure 28).
No features were recorded, although scattered FCR is present in several areas of the site. The previously
recorded thermal features have likely been scattered as a result of deflation and erosion processes.

Artifacts
A low-density scatter of lithics and ceramics was observed at the site. Lithics included debitage, a core, a
retouched flake, a hammerstone, and several pieces of ground stone. Identified ceramic types included
El Paso Polychrome and El Paso brownware. The presence of El Paso Polychrome ceramics indicates a
Late Formative period occupation of the site.

Site Summary
FB 6836 is a Late Formative period campsite that consists of a low-density scatter of lithics, ceramics, and
scattered FCR. The site exhibits integrity and is situated amid coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts. No
datable deposits were observed. The low-density artifact scatter does contain a variety of lithic artifacts.
Diagnostic artifacts include El Paso Polychrome ceramics. Despite the variety of artifact types and the
presence of diagnostic ceramics, there is no chronometric potential for the site. Therefore, FB 6836 is
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 6837 (41EP1887)
Site Setting
FB 6837 is situated amid interdunal areas of low coppice dunes capped by mesquite. A northwestâsoutheasttrending road runs 200 m west of the site. Surface sediments in interdunal areas are composed of lag pebbles
mixed with loose/slightly compact sand. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite and broom snakeweed, with
smaller amounts of sand sage. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. Interdunal
areas have been moderately impacted by aeolian deflation and alluvial runoff, so that artifacts have been
scattered. Military debris is also present. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 6837 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It contained one stain and an artifact scatter, including flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics. Presently, the site consists of a thermal feature with
2
an associated lithic and ceramic scatter covering an area of 13,831 m in 21 positive TRUs (Figure 29). The
thermal feature is an ash stain that has been minimally impacted by erosion and deflation, retains integrity, and contains potentially datable deposits of charcoal and ashy sediment, as verified by trowel testing. Buried deposits are likely to be present beneath coppice dunes at this site. A very low-density scatter of
FCR was observed across the site. Surface artifacts were dispersed as a result of deflation and erosion.

Figure 29. Site map of FB 6837.

Artifacts
The site includes a high-density artifact scatter that is composed of almost 400 ceramic artifacts, with
several lithic items. Lithic artifacts consist of debitage, retouched tools, and ground stone. The ceramic
artifacts consist of El Paso Polychrome, El Paso Bichrome, and El Paso brownware. The presence of
El Paso Polychrome suggests a Late Formative period occupation. A historical-period metal pipe was also
recorded.

Site Summary
FB 6837 is a Late Formative period campsite that contains one thermal feature and a high-density ceramic
and lithic scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity and is situated within a coppice dune field in
interdunal blowouts. The single feature is an ash stain that has been minimally disturbed. Feature fill potentially could provide radiocarbon samples. The presence of datable deposits and an unusually substantial
ceramic scatter suggest that data from this site could be used to address MiddleâLate Formative period
research themes, including logistical use of the basin, task-site structure, subsistence, and ceramic technology. FB 6837 is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6839 (41EP1898)
Site Setting
FB 6839 is located in the Hueco Bolson, in a slightly elevated area overlooking a large playa to the north. The
northwest third of the site is in coppice-dune terrain, with dunes that are up to 2 m high. Interdunal areas
have extensive sand sheets covering a Q3 soil. Dunes also cap this soil and compose about 20 percent of
the site area. Artifacts and features are more abundant where this soil is exposed. The central area of the
site is predominantly sand sheets, with lower, smaller dunes. Several interdunal areas in the site are closed;
pond water resulting in clay-rich sediment diminishes archaeological visibility in the central area of the
site. The south part of (expanded) FB 6839 is also coppice-dune terrain, with dunes that are up to 1.5 m
high. Over most of the site, the surface dips slightly to the north.
Vegetation is largely confined to the stabilized dunes and includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, fourwing
saltbush, sand sage, forbs, grasses, and desert holly. Disturbance to FB 6839 includes sheetwash and wind
erosion plus some off-road driving. There is a small amount of modern debris scattered over the site, which
is 51 to 75 percent intact.

Site Description
Consequential to 2009 survey results, FB 6839 was merged with six other previously recorded sites, all of
which have higher Fort Bliss site numbers. FB 6839 was first recorded by UTEP in 1976. It consisted of a
single thermal feature, a lithic concentration, and a dispersed scatter of flaked stone, ground stone, and
ceramics (Church and Stowe 2006:I-154). Whalen (1978:116) revisited the site and also identified two
features and an associated artifact scatter. He identified the presence of El Paso Polychrome ceramics and
a single Chupadero Black-on-white sherd. UTEP returned to the site in 1997 and recorded a single thermal
feature with surface artifact scatter (Lukowski n.d.).
This site was included in an extensive 2001 site-evaluation project (Church and Stowe 2006:I-154).
LMAS reported a stain and an FCR feature with an assemblage of over 300 artifacts, most of which were
sherds. Artifacts included small quantities of El Paso Brown rim sherds, El Paso Polychrome sherds, and

102

Seco Corrugated sherds, leading to the conclusion that the site included Mesilla and El Paso phase occupations. Based on trowel-testing results, LMAS suggested that buried deposits are present at FB 6839 and
recommended the site eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d (Church and Stowe 2006:I-154).
FB 6840 was located by Whalen (1978:116â117). He described the site as an El Paso phase site with
four âhearths,â and a light artifact scatter that included El Paso Polychrome, flaked stone, and ground stone.
FB 6862 was also recorded by Whalen (1978:122â123). This El Paso phase site is described as including
one feature and a light artifact scatter with flaked stone, ground stone, and some El Paso Polychrome.
FB 7955 is another site originally recorded by Whalen (1978:165). He described the site as a small
camp of undetermined affiliation with three hearths, flaked stone artifacts, and FCR. The site was reportedly
revisited by a UTEP project in 1997 (Lukowski n.d.). In 2001, Church and Stowe (2006:I-282) located five
features, four of which had charcoal, along with a diffuse artifact scatter. The site was extensively trowel
tested, leading to the observation that subsurface deposits are present. Artifacts reported from this site include a
âGypsum-style projectile pointâ (Church and Stowe 2006:I-282) and El Paso Polychrome sherds. Based
on these results, the site was recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.
Whalen (1978:165) reported FB 7956 to be a small site of undetermined affiliation that included one
feature, flaked stone, and ground stone. The site was revisited in 2001 by Church and Stowe (2006:I-284)
and found to have been heavily disturbed by tanks and other vehicles. Testing did not identify buried
deposits, and they concluded that it no longer met Fort Bliss site-definition criteria.
FB 11467 was defined as a site by Lukowski (1990a), based on survey data acquired by Whalen in
the 1970s. This site was composed of one feature, El Paso Polychrome, and flaked stone. FB 11479 was
another site that was defined based on Whalenâs (1978) survey results (Lukowski 1990a). This site included
only flaked stone and El Paso brownware.
These sites were merged in accordance with Fort Bliss site-definition criteria, with FB 6839 retained
as the lowest site number. Based on previous results, the site minimally has Archaic period and EarlyâLate
Formative period components, datable features, and cultural deposits. The enlarged FB 6839 covers
2
155,284 m in 216 positive TRUs (Figure 30). The 16 identified features include ash stains and FCR/burnedcaliche concentrations ranging from low to high degrees of disturbance. The features are widely distributed
across the site in interdunal areas and at the bases of dunes where the Q3 soil is preserved. One of the
FCR features (Feature 12051) is shown in Figure 31. Based on trowel-testing results, there are 11 features that retain deposits, all in the range of 5 cm deep. Previous assessments that this site has buried
cultural deposits remain valid. FCR that is not associated with features is also widely distributed across
the surface of the site.

Artifacts
Artifacts are widely scattered, although there are also two concentrations of El Paso brownware located in
the southern half of the site. Neither concentration is associated with a feature. Other identified sherds included
Mimbres Black-on-white, Chupadero Black-on-white, Playas Red, Playas Red Textured, El Paso Bichrome,
and El Paso Polychrome. Together they reflect EarlyâLate Formative occupations.
Lithic artifacts consist of debitage, cores, a cobble biface, cobble unifaces, tested cobbles, retouched
tools, hammerstones, and a variety of ground stone. Unlike the ceramics, there are no distinct concentrations,
and the flaked stone is widely dispersed across the site at low densities. The most notable of the flaked
stone artifacts is a worked quartz crystal.
Over two dozen pieces of ground stone are scattered across the site, including two slab-metate fragments, mano fragments, and many indeterminate fragments. The ground stone items were manufactured
from a variety of material types. Two hammerstones were also recorded. In addition, a single historicalperiod barrel was identified.

Site Summary
FB 6839 is a multicomponent site with numerous thermal features and an extensive artifact scatter. It
exhibits integrity and is situated in a coppice-dune setting within interdunal blowouts. The results of this
survey are consistent with previous projects in recognizing an extended period of occupation; however,
no additional Archaic period artifacts were found. This location appears to have been repeatedly occupied
during the Formative period. The slightly higher elevation and overview of a nearby playa to the northnorthwest may have made this an attractive camping location.
The 16 features and almost 1,000 artifacts attest to substantial use of the slight rise upon which FB 6839
is located. Almost 70 percent of the features have the potential to yield datable materials. In addition, the
site assemblage is substantial and contains a diverse array of lithic and ceramic artifacts. This assemblage
can be used to address a variety of research domains. As a result, we concur with the previous recommendation that FB 6839 is eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, under criterion d. The New Mexico SHPO concurred with this recommendation in 2006.

FB 6842 (41EP1934)
Site Setting
FB 6842 is situated amid interdunal blowouts and low coppice dunes capped by mesquite. An unnamed
military road runs northwestâsoutheast approximately 100 m southwest of the site. The site occupies a
low rise running northwestâsoutheast that overlooks a playa to the northeast. Surface sediments are loose
blowsands, except in deflated interdunal blowouts where carbonate nodules and lag gravels are mixed with
slightly compact sand. Vegetation consists of mesquite, broom snakeweed, and sand sage. Surface visibility
105

was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. A high level of modern erosion and deflation has impacted
the site in interdunal blowouts. Military surface debris is also present. An estimated 1â25 percent of the
site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 6842 was originally recorded in 1976 by UTEP, at which point it was reported to be a scatter of El Paso
Polychrome ceramics, flaked stone tools and debitage, and ground stone (Whalen 1978). The site was
revisited by UTEP in 1997, when it was described as a scatter of ground stone, flaked stone tools and
debitage, and El Paso Polychrome ceramics (Lukowski n.d.). The current survey expanded the boundaries
of FB 6842 through the recording of artifacts and features; so, it now includes previously recorded sites
FB 7961, FB 7962, FB 7963, FB 7964, FB 7965, and FB 11472.
FB 7961 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1977 (Whalen 1978). It was reported to have two FCR features, flaked stone, and ground stone. The site was revisited by UTEP in 1997, when it consisted of two
thermal features and a scatter of flaked stone and ground stone (Lukowski n.d.).
FB 7962 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1977 (Whalen 1978). It reportedly had one FCR feature
with flaked stone. The site was revisited by UTEP in 1997, at which point it contained three stains and a
scatter of ground stone, flaked stone, and FCR (Lukowski n.d.).
FB 7963 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1977 (Whalen 1978). It contained one FCR feature,
along with ground stone and flaked stone. The site was revisited by UTEP in 1997, when it reportedly
contained several stains, ceramics, ground stone, and a core (Lukowski n.d.).
FB 7964 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1977 (Whalen 1978). It was reported to contain two
thermal features and a scatter of flaked stone. The site was revisited by UTEP in 1997, when it was
described as having one FCR feature, a stain, and a scatter of ground stone, flaked stone, and FCR
(Lukowski n.d.).
FB 7965 was initially recorded in 1977 by UTEP (Whalen 1978). It contained one FCR feature, flaked
stone debitage, and ground stone. The site was revisited by UTEP in 1997 (Lukowski n.d.). At this time it
was described as two stains, an FCR feature, and a scatter of artifacts, including a hammerstone, ground
stone, and flaked stone.
FB 11472 was originally recorded by DOE personnel in 1994 (Lukowski 1997). It reportedly contained
a single FCR feature with no associated artifacts.
Currently, FB 6842 consists of 10 thermal features with artifact concentrations covering an area
2
of 60,549 m in 86 positive TRUs (Figure 32). The site is long and narrow, occupying a low rise that overlooks
a possible playa to the northeast. Clusters of features and artifacts are present across the site and may
reflect specific activity areas or separate occupations. Thermal features include 3 FCR/burned-caliche
concentrations, none of which have deposits, and 7 dark, ashy stains with no associated FCR, including Feature 1890, which is shown in Figure 33. The FCR/burned-caliche concentrations were all highly disturbed and without deposits. The ash stains range from high to low levels of disturbance. Trowel testing indicated that the stains have dark, ashy fill, generally in the range of 5 cm deep.

Artifacts
A moderately dense artifact scatter made up of lithics and ceramics was recorded. Lithic artifacts were composed of a variety of material types and consist of debitage, cores, a uniface, a hammerstone, and various
ground stone items. Identified ceramic types consist of El Paso brownware, El Paso Polychrome, and El Paso
Brown. El Paso Polychrome indicates a Late Formative component, and El Paso Brown ceramics are more
indicative of an EarlyâMiddle Formative period component. A single historical-period metal nail was
also recorded.

Site Summary
FB 6842 is a multicomponent site consisting of thermal features and artifact concentrations. The site is situated along a low rise overlooking a playa. Although overall geomorphic integrity at FB 6842 is poor,
there are locations within the site that are well preserved, with potential for cultural deposits. This rise is
capped by coppice dunes with eroded interdunal blowouts. Some of the features have been completely deflated, but there are seven intact stains that contain datable material. The El Paso Brown and El Paso
Polychrome ceramics suggests the presence of both EarlyâMiddle Formative and Late Formative period occupations. Concentrations and clusters of features are discernable, reflecting discrete activity
areas or separate occupations. The presence of potentially datable deposits in most of the features may be
able to clarify this situation. Artifact counts are not particularly high, but a diversity of artifact types and
materials exists. The site assemblage could possibly provide data for addressing EarlyâLate Formative research issues at a limited level, including land use, logistic use of the basin, site-formation processes, site
structure, subsistence, and technology. However, because of poor preservation, FB 6842 is recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 6881 (41EP1643)
Site Setting
FB 6881 is situated among coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts. Surface sediments consist of aeolian
sands with lag gravels present. Vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, sand sage, and soaptree
yucca. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A high degree of modern erosion
and deflation has impacted the site. Sources of disturbance include aeolian erosion, water erosion, bioturbation,
and military debris. An estimated 1â25 percent of the site remains intact.

FB 6881 was originally recorded in 1977 by UTEP (Whalen 1978). It contained a scatter of ceramics,
including El Paso Polychrome and Chihuahuan wares, as well as flaked stone and ground stone. No features
were recorded. The current survey has expanded the site boundaries of FB 6881 through continuous artifacts
so that this site now encompasses several previously recorded sites, including FB 6882, FB 14578, and
FB 14580.
FB 6882 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It was reported to have one stain,
a ceramic artifact concentration with El Paso Polychrome, and flaked stone.
FB 14578 (41EP4990) was recorded and evaluated by the DOE in 1994 (Lukowski 1997). The site
2
was described as a prehistoric camp covering 10,833 m and containing ceramics, flaked stone, hammerstones,
ground stone, a burned-rock feature, and a small ash-stain feature. The site was given an El Paso phase
temporal affiliation based on El Paso Polychrome ceramics. The site was revisited for testing in 2000 by
TRC (Baugh et al. 2003). Shovel tests and test units were placed, and flotation/C14 samples were collected.
Charcoal extracted from a flotation sample yielded a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1236â1301 at one sigma
(Beta-145992) (Baugh et al. 2003:B-155), indicating an El Paso phase date for the feature from which it
was extracted. This revisit confirmed earlier observations of artifact types and discovered some intact
subsurface deposits.
FB 14580 was originally defined by DOE personnel in 1994 (Lukowski 1997). It contained a small
scatter of ceramics, flaked stone, and FCR.
Presently, FB 6881 consists of a highly dense artifact scatter of ceramic and lithic artifacts covering
2
an area of 78,575 m in 93 positive TRUs (Figure 34). No features were observed at this site during the
current survey. The artifact scatter is extensive and dense, but only a light scatter of FCR was observed.
The potential for buried deposits underneath nearby coppice dunes exists in some areas, as is indicated
by shovel tests conducted by TRC in the FB 14578 area.

Artifacts
A high-density artifact scatter composed of lithics and ceramics was recorded. Lithic counts were relatively
low but were composed of a variety of material and artifact types. These consist of debitage, cores, a biface,
a scraper, and ground stone. Ceramic artifacts were more numerous and are represented by a diversity of
types, including El Paso brownware, El Paso decorated, Chupadero Black-on-white, Lincoln Black-onred, Three-Rivers Red-on-terracotta, El Paso Polychrome, El Paso Brown, and Mimbres Black-on-white.
These ceramic types span the length of the Formative period, but most are suggestive of a Late Formative
occupation. Exceptions are El Paso Brown and Mimbres Black-on-white, which date to the EarlyâMiddle
Formative period. Additionally, a soldered hole-in-top can and a metal horseshoe were recorded, reflecting
a limited early twentieth-century historical-period occupation.

Site Summary
FB 6881 is a multicomponent site consisting of a highly dense ceramic scatter with a smaller amount of lithic
artifacts. No features were observed. The site is situated among coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts.
Geomorphic integrity is poor at FB 6881. Artifacts were numerous and included a variety of types dating
to EarlyâLate Formative times. Although the lithic assemblage is relatively small, it also contains a variety of materials and types. Overall, the artifact assemblage does contain the potential to address research
domains; however, the absence of datable features precludes the possibility of placing these artifacts within
a temporal context. Therefore, FB 6881 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 6885 (41EP1669)
FB 6885 is an extensive lithic and ceramic scatter that encompasses 27 separate sites originally recorded
by Whalen (1978). These sites include FB 6789, FB 6833, FB 6885, FB 6886, FB 6887, FB 6888, FB 6889,
FB 6890, FB 6891, FB 6892, FB 6893, FB 6898, FB 7924, FB 7925, FB 7926, FB 7927, FB 8049, FB 8050,
FB 8051, FB 8052, FB 8053, FB 8092, FB 10344, FB 11442, FB 11443, FB 11444, and FB 11504. Together
2
they cover approximately 805,175 m and include approximately 30 FCR concentrations, 30 stains, 2 middens,
1500 lithic artifacts, and 5,000 ceramic artifacts. The assemblage includes diagnostic artifacts that indicate
Paleoindian, Archaic, and Formative period occupations. Lukowski and Stuart (1996:H-48) recommended
this site eligible for listing in the NRHP.
SRI identified 26 positive TRUs that extend the boundary of FB 6885 slightly into the project area (Figure 35). Cultural materials in these TRUs include two FCR/burned caliche features, several El Paso brownware sherds, one Chupadero Black-on-white sherd, small quantities of flaked stone, and dispersed FCR. In addition, 6 positive TRUs that connect FB 14584 with this larger site were also recorded; FB 14584 was
originally recorded by Lukowski and Stuart (1996). We therefore recommend that the boundary of FB 6885
be extended to include these TRUs and FB 14584. The result would be to increase the overall area of
2
FB 6885 to 810,797 m . FB 14584 has a previous recommendation of not eligible for listing in the NRHP
and is not affected by current results. FB 6885 was previously recommended eligible for listing in the
NRHP, and while the site remains eligible, the portion added during the current project does not contribute to the eligibility recommendation.

FB 7685 (41EP1600)
Site Setting
FB 7685 is situated in coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts (Figure 36). Surface sediments were characterized by loose blowsand. Vegetation includes mesquite, soaptree yucca, sand sage, and broom snakeweed.
Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. The site has been heavily impacted by
aeolian erosion, water erosion, bioturbation, and military activities. An estimated 1â25 percent of the site
remains intact.

Site Description and Artifacts
FB 7685 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It was reported to contain two FCR
features with no associated artifacts. Presently, the site consists of a single thermal feature with one
2
retouched flake and some scattered FCR, all an associated artifact scatter covering 3,286 m in four positive TRUs (Figure 37). The thermal feature is a moderately disturbed FCR/burned-caliche concentration
that contains ash deposits with charcoal flecking in 5 cm of fill. Scattered FCR was present to the northeast and southeast of the feature. A single retouched flake was the only artifact recorded in the vicinity of
the feature.

Site Summary
FB 7685 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. The site, which exhibits a low
degree of integrity, is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout area. The FCR/caliche
concentration does contain some charcoal flecking and may be a datable feature. In addition, a single retouched flake was observed in the area of the feature, which precludes addressing any research domains.
As a result, FB 7685 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7721 (41EP1966)
Site Setting
FB 7721 is located in the northeast portion of the project area, within the coppice-dune terrain of the Hueco
Bolson. This extensive site, which results from the combining of 11 previously recorded sites, is situated
on the southern flank of a slight rise that possibly is an upthrust block (see Chapter 3). There are shallow
north-northwest-trending troughs on both the east and west sides of FB 7721. Approximately 30 percent
of the site area is covered by stabilized dunes that are up to 2 m high. Interdunal areas, which compose
most of the site, typically are covered with a thin layer of recent (Q4) sands. Exposed interdunal areas
have lag deposits derived from the Isaackâs Ranch Formation. The site surface generally dips to the south.
In descending order of abundance, vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, fourwing saltbush,
forbs, and grasses. There is little vegetation in the interdunal areas. Disturbance to FB 7721 includes aeolian
and fluvial erosion (including minor channel cutting), two maintained dirt roads, and a lesser amount of
off-road tracks. The site is considered to be 79â99 percent intact.

Site Description
FB 7721 was originally recorded as a small site of only 0.04 ha by Whalen (1978:160). However, with a series
of site mergers necessitated by new survey data and modern Fort Bliss site-definition criteria, FB 7721
now incorporates 11 previously recorded sites. Whalen (1978:160) described the site as including a light
aceramic artifact scatter and two hearths. The site was revisited by Lukowski (1997:C-11), who reported
the site to include one El Paso brownware sherd, a dozen pieces each of flaked and ground stone, and some
scattered FCR. The site was recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP (Lukowski 1997:G-8).

114

Whalen (1978:160) reported that FB 7722 (41EP1965) included two hearths and a very light scatter
of undecorated pottery. He did not assign an affiliation to this site. Lukowski (1997:C-11, F-27) subsequently
reported FB 7722 to include two partly deflated stains, one plain sherd, five metate fragments, and a few
pieces of flaked and ground stone. This site was recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
When recorded by Whalen (1978:160), FB 7723 (41EP1963) included one hearth and at least one piece
of ground stone. The site was revisited in 1997, at which time five stains, two of which included FCR, were
recorded, along with small amounts of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics (Lukowski 1997:C-11).
The site was later evaluated by Church and Stowe (2006), who identified two features and also located
subsurface ash and staining. The reported assemblage included over 100 artifacts, with a few El Paso decorated
sherds. Church and Stowe concluded that FB 7723 was eligible for listing in the NRHP (2006:I-247).
Whalen (1978:160) recorded FB 7724 (41EP1961) to include several hearths, ground stone, and plain
ceramics. This site was subsequently evaluated by Lukowski (1997:C-11), who reported 1 stain, 14 El Paso
brownware sherds, 2 Mimbres Black-on-white sherds, and several pieces of both flaked and ground stone.
A small amount of FCR was also seen. The site was recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP
(Lukowski 1997:G-8).
Whalen (1978:160) reported that FB 7725 (41EP1962) lacked features but included flaked stone and
unidentified brown ware sherds. The site was revisited by Lukowski (1997:C-11), who reported 2 pieces
of flaked stone and over 200 pieces of FCR. Based on these characteristics, FB 7725 was recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP (Lukowski 1997:G-8).
Another of the many small sites recorded by Whalen (1978:160) in the area was FB 7726 (41EP1964).
This site included one FCR feature, flaked stone, and ground stone. Lukowski (1997:C-11, F-27) recorded
one FCR feature and two stains at this site, all of which were at least partially deflated. Additionally, he
reported small quantities of flaked stone, ground stone, and plain ceramics. This site also was recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP (Lukowski 1997:G-8).
Whalen (1978:160) described FB 7727 (41EP1958) as a small site of unknown affiliation having only
flaked and ground stone. Lukowski (1997:C-11) expanded the site by locating four features; two sherds,
one of which was âEl Paso decoratedâ; small counts of ground stone and flaked stone; and FCR. Three of
the features were reported to have charcoal flecks (Lukowski 1997:F-27). The site was recommended not
eligible for listing in the NRHP (1997:G-8). FB 7727 was included in a subsequent evaluation project
(Church and Stowe 2006). Church and Stowe (2006:I-247) did not locate features or subsurface deposits,
in spite of extensive trowel testing. The site did not meet Fort Bliss site-definition criteria and consequently
was recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Whalen (1978:161) reported FB 7729 (41EP1959) as a small artifact scatter composed of flaked stone
and ceramics. The site was revisited by Lukowski (1997:C-12), who reported a single FCR feature and a
few artifacts, including El Paso brownware. The feature was described as lacking a stain and as being partially
deflated (Lukowski 1997:F-27). The site was recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP (Lukowski
1997:G-8).
As with the other sites merged into FB 7721, Whalen (1978:161) first recorded FB 7730 (41EP1960).
He reported two features and two flaked stone scatters. Lukowski (1997:C-12) described this site as having
three FCR features and three stains, with an artifact scatter that included over 30 pieces of undifferentiated
brown ware. All of the features were described as partly deflated. Lukowski (1997:G-8) concluded that
the site was âpotentially eligible,â precipitating subsequent evaluation by Church and Stowe (2006), who
found two stains, a concentration of over 100 sherds, and several hundred scattered artifacts. Ceramics
included El Paso Brown and El Paso decorated, although the overwhelming majority of the observed sherds
were El Paso brownware (Church and Stowe 2006:I-249). The site was extensively trowel tested, providing
evidence for buried deposits. The site was ascribed to both the Mesilla and El Paso phases and recommended
eligible for listing in the NRHP (Church and Stowe 2006:I-249).
Whalen (1978:161) recorded two FCR features, flaked stone, and a single piece of ground stone at
FB 7732 (41EP1955). Lukowski (1997) revisited this site and expanded it to include six features with a
small amount of flaked stone. He (1997:G-8) recommended the site not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

115

FB 7733 (41EP1954) was initially reported to have two FCR features and a small amount of flaked
stone (Whalen 1978:161). Lukowski (1997:C-12) recorded five features at this site, with a single plain sherd
and seven pieces of flaked stone. One piece of ground stone was also located. The site was recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP (Lukowski 1997:G-8).
FB 11507 was previously recorded during an in-house site rectification project (90-05). No report was
generated for this work.
2
The merged site covers an area of 157,437 m in 182 positive TRUs (Figure 38). The features at this
site include 12 FCR concentrations and 51 stains. Extensive trowel testing demonstrated that the stains have
fill depths of up to ca. 10 cm, often contain charcoal, and invariably contain ash. Six of the FCR/burned-caliche concentrations have deposits, which are up to 10 cm deep in 2 of the features. Features are distributed over the entire site, although there are two areas of greater feature density in the southern part of the
site. Many of the features remain well-preserved, with no more than low levels of disturbance.

Artifacts
Artifacts are also broadly distributed over the site. Recorded ceramic types include El Paso brownware,
El Paso Polychrome, and El Paso Brown and are dominated by El Paso brownware sherds. One sherd concentration was found within the original boundaries of FB 7721 and presumably is the same El Paso brownware concentration first reported by Church and Stowe (2006:I-249). Recorded lithic artifacts include debitage,
cores, tested cobbles, retouched tools, hammerstones, and a variety of ground stone. These artifacts are composed of a variety of materials. No diagnostic artifacts were recorded. The site also contains a dispersed
scatter of historical-period artifacts, including various types of cans and a government luggage tag.

Site Summary
FB 7721 is situated on a slight rise within a coppice-dune setting. The site reflects multiple occupations,
with over 60 features and several hundred artifacts distributed over a sizeable area. The site is well preserved,
which is attested to by the numerous intact features that contain datable materials. Although the features
are distributed across the site, there are two main clusters in the southern end of the site. These clusters
could in part reflect discrete activity areas and/or multiple occupation episodes. A variety of lithic and
ceramic artifacts are present, with ceramic types suggesting the recurrent use of the site throughout the
Formative period. These data could be used to address EarlyâLate Formative research themes, including
land use, the logistical use of the basin, site-formation processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology.
FB 7721 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 7908 (41EP1841)
Site Setting
FB 7908 is situated among medium-sized coppice dunes capped by mesquite. Interdunal areas contain
exposed caliche at the surface, as well as slightly compact sand and lag gravels in some areas. Vegetation
is dominated by mesquite, with broom snakeweed and soaptree yucca also present. Surface visibility was
estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. The site has been highly deflated and eroded by aeolian and
alluvial processes, with military surface debris present. An estimated 1â25 percent of the site remains intact.

116

Figure 38. Site map of FB 7721.

117

Site Description
FB 7908 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It contained one FCR/stain feature, a
core, and ground stone. Currently, the site consists of a thermal feature and an associated artifact scatter
2
covering an area of 15,560 m in 17 positive TRUs (Figure 39). The ash stain is moderately disturbed, but
does contain some charcoal flecks to a depth of 5 cm. In addition, a dispersed scatter of FCR is distributed
across the site.

Artifacts
A low-density scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts was recorded. Lithic artifacts are composed of a
variety of materials, and include debitage, cores, and ground stone. Recorded ceramic types included
El Paso Polychrome and Seco Corrugated, which indicate a Late Formative period occupation.

Site Summary
FB 7908 is a Late Formative period campsite consisting of a thermal feature and low-density artifact scatter.
The site exhibits a low degree of integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout.
The single ash stain is moderately disturbed and has a low potential for yielding datable materials. In addition,
artifact counts are insufficient to provide information relative to addressing any research domains. Therefore, FB 7908 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7909 (41EP1598)
Site Setting
FB 7909 is located approximately 500 m from a northâsouth-trending dirt road. The site is dispersed
throughout interdunal blowouts between coppice dunes. Surface sediments consist of loose blowsand.
Vegetation included is mesquite, fourwing saltbush, broom snakeweed, Torrey yucca, sand sage, and various
forbs and grasses. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A moderate degree of
aeolian and alluvial erosion has impacted the site. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7909 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978) and contained a hearth and ground
stone implements. The current site boundary has expanded the site to now include the previously recorded
FB 7910. FB 7910 was recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978) and contained a hearth, a scraper, and
ground stone. Presently, FB 7909 consists of a low-density scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts, with no
2
associated features, covering an area of 13,767 m in 19 positive TRUs (Figure 40). A very light scatter of
burned caliche and basalt FCR was observed across the site. Erosion and deflation has likely reduced
the previously recorded features to highly dispersed scatters of FCR.

Artifacts
The surface artifact assemblage is composed of lithic and ceramic artifacts. Lithic artifacts consist of debitage, cores, retouched tools, ground stone, and a hammerstone. Two projectile points were collected and
118

119

Figure 40. Site map of FB 7909.

120

identified as a Late Archaic stemmed point and a Middle Archaic stemmed, concave-base point typologically
similar to the San Jose type (see Appendix G). The presence of El Paso Polychrome ceramics indicates a
Late Formative period occupation, and the projectile points provide evidence for Late and Middle Archaic
components.

Site Summary
FB 7909 is a multicomponent site composed of a low-density lithic and ceramic artifact scatter, with no
associated features. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity and is situated in a coppice-dune setting
within an interdunal blowout. The lack of thermal features precludes the possibility of retrieving datable
materials. The assemblage contains a variety of artifacts, including MiddleâLate Archaic projectile points
and El Paso Polychrome sherds. Although this assemblage does have the potential to address research
questions, it represents a mixed palimpsest that lacks datable botanical remains. Therefore, FB 7909
is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7914 (41EP1645)
Site Setting
FB 7914 is located on a slight rise in the coppice-dune terrain of the Hueco Bolson. The site is approximately 0.8 km east of Loop 375. The site surface dips slightly toward the east. This small site is located in
a blowout between several coppice dunes. The interdunal surface is loose aeolian sand with some lag
gravels. Vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, sand sage, saltbush, and soaptree yucca and is
largely confined to stabilized dunes around the site. The site has been heavily disturbed by aeolian erosion, sheetwash erosion, and bioturbation. There is also a lesser degree of disturbance from off-road traffic. The site is less than 25 percent intact, and ground visibility is good.

Site Description
2

FB 7914 covers an area of 2,955 m , including much of the original FB 7914 polygon (Figure 41). The
site was originally recorded by Whalen (1978:165). In tabular format, he describes the site as being of undetermined affiliation and having two hearths.
The site was relocated a short distance northeast of its previous location. This site, as currently recognized, includes one moderately dispersed roasting pit composed of FCR and associated ashy deposits with
abundant charcoal flecks.

Artifacts
Artifacts from FB 7914 include 1 basalt cobble biface and over 40 pieces of FCR within four positive
TRUs. Most of this FCR is associated with the feature. No ceramics were located at this site.

Site Summary
FB 7914 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation on a slight rise in the coppice-dune terrain. The site has poor geomorphic integrity. The FCR feature does contain ash deposits with charcoal that
could provide radiocarbon dates. However, only a single flaked artifact was recorded at the site. Because
121

122

Figure 42. Overview photograph of FB 7916.

the single feature and single piece of flaked stone are inadequate for effectively addressing any research
domains, FB 7914 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7916 (41EP1842)
Site Setting
FB 7916 is situated among 1â3-m-high coppice dunes and associated interdunal areas (Figure 42). Surface
sediments consist of fine aeolian sands, with carbonate nodules and lag gravels visible in deflated interdunal
areas. The local vegetation community is dominated by mesquite but also includes broom snakeweed and
fourwing saltbush. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A low degree of
aeolian and alluvial erosion has impacted the site, but vehicle tracks have cut through the sand and severely
impacted portions of the site. An estimated 51â75 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7916 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It contained one stain feature and a
scatter of artifacts consisting of El Paso brownware and ground stone. The current survey has extended
the boundaries of FB 7916 to include the previously recorded site FB 11439, which was recorded by DOE
personnel in 1994. It was reported to contain flaked stone and ground stone (Lukowski 1997).
2
Currently, FB 7916 consists of an artifact scatter covering an area of 5,650 m in nine positive TRUs
(Figure 43). The site lacks features with datable deposits; therefore, absolute chronometric potential

123

Figure 43. Site map of FB 7916.

124

does not exist. FCR is scattered throughout the site, suggesting that deflation and erosion have disarticulated
features that might have been present at one time.

Artifacts
A moderately dense artifact scatter composed of lithic and ceramic artifacts was recorded at FB 7916.
Lithic artifacts included debitage, ground stone, and hammerstones. El Paso brownware ceramics were
identified and indicate a broad Formative period temporal affiliation for the site.

Site Summary
FB 7916 is a Formative period site consisting of a moderately dense lithic and ceramic artifact scatter. The
site is located among coppice dunes, with cultural materials visible in eroded interdunal blowouts. No features were observed; there is no potential for absolute chronometric dating. Diagnostic artifacts include
El Paso brownware ceramics. Although lithic artifact counts are low, overall artifact counts could provide
information relative to addressing research domains, but absolute dating of the site is not possible.
Therefore, FB 7916 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7918 (41EP1595)
Site Setting
FB 7918 is situated amid coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts. Surface sediments are primarily fine aeolian
sand with lag gravels and carbonate nodules. Vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, and sand
sage. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A high degree of aeolian erosion,
water erosion, bioturbation, and military vehicle traffic were identified. An estimated 1â25 percent of the
site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7918 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). The site contained an FCR feature, a
stain feature with FCR, and ground stone. FB 7919 (41EP1596) is another previously recorded site located
within the current boundaries of FB 7918. FB 7919 was previously recorded by the same UTEP survey
and included an FCR feature and an artifact scatter consisting of ceramics, flaked stone, and ground stone
(Whalen 1978).
Presently, FB 7918 consists of thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of
2
25,145 m in 30 positive TRUs (Figure 44). Features at the site include two highly disturbed FCR/burnedcaliche concentrations without deposits and an ash stain with shallow deposits of about 5 cm. There are
two artifact concentrations separated by approximately 30 m, with sparse artifacts between these areas.
One thermal feature is located in the middle of one of these concentrations, and the other two are close
together in the other concentration. This suggests the possibility of two discrete activity areas within
the site. Scattered FCR is present throughout the site.

125

126
Figure 44. Site map of FB 7918.

Artifacts
A moderately dense artifact scatter composed primarily of lithics, but also including ceramics, was recorded
at the site. Lithic artifacts consisted of flaked stone debitage, as well as a core and a variety of ground stone
implements. The debitage is made up of a variety of materials. Ceramics were composed of a small amount
of El Paso brownware, which indicates a broad temporal affiliation in the Formative period. None of the
lithic artifacts are temporally diagnostic.

Site Summary
FB 7918 is a small Formative period camp that includes three thermal features and a moderately dense artifact scatter. The site exhibits poor geomorphic integrity and is situated in an active coppice-dune field
with cultural materials visible in eroded interdunal blowouts. A single intact ash stain could yield datable material, but there are no further indications of cultural deposits. The presence of El Paso brownware
sherds indicates a Formative period occupation, but there are no artifacts at this site that could be used to
expand or refine chronological information. The surface artifact assemblage does exhibit a diverse array
of material and artifact types. Although one feature at this site could be radiocarbon-dated, FB 7918 has
little potential to provide data for addressing research questions. FB 7918 is therefore recommended not
eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7920 (41EP1594)
Site Setting
FB 7920 is situated among 1â2-m-tall coppice dunes. Aeolian sands mixed with carbonate nodules and
pebble lag gravels make up the surface sediments at the site. The local vegetation community is dominated
by mesquite, with broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush also present. Surface visibility was estimated
to be between 76 and 99 percent. Aeolian erosion, water erosion, and bioturbation have moderately impacted
the site. Vehicle tracks have severely impacted features on the site. An estimated 76â99 percent of the site
remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7920 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976. It consisted of three thermal features and ground
stone (Whalen 1978). LMAS reevaluated and tested the site in 2002 and documented two features and a
scatter of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics (Church and Stowe 2006:I-280). El Paso brownware
ceramics provided a Formative period temporal affiliation. The site was recommended eligible for listing
in the NRHP, under criterion d (Church and Stowe 2006:I-282).
Currently, FB 7920 consists of two thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area
2
of 1,663 m in two positive TRUs (Figure 45). Thermal features include a highly disturbed FCR/burnedcaliche concentration with 5 cm of deposits and a highly disturbed ash stain with shallow deposits that
are situated in the same interdunal blowout. The site has low potential for yielding datable materials. A
light scatter of FCR was also documented across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter consisting of lithics and ceramics was recorded at FB 7920. Lithics were
composed of debitage and a hammerstone. Ceramics included El Paso brownware, which suggests a broad
Formative Period temporal affiliation.

Site Summary
FB 7920 is a very small Formative period camp consisting of two thermal features and a low-density artifact
scatter. The site is situated among low coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts. The two features at this site
have shallow fill that may be able to provide radiocarbon samples. However, artifact counts are very low, with
little diversity in types. Based on these factors, the site is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7928 (41EP1593)
Site Setting
This site is located in the coppice-dune fields of the Hueco Bolson. The site surface dips slightly toward
the west. Coppice dunes in this area are up to 2 m high and compose approximately 20 percent of the site
area. Interdunal areas, which compose most of the site, are heavily deflated and contain recent sands with
some gravels and caliche nodules. Interdunal areas that are not so severely eroded retain a truncated Q3
soil. The setting is desert scrubland, with mesquite, fourwing saltbush, broom snakeweed, and some forbs
and grasses. There is very little vegetation in the interdunal areas, resulting in good ground visibility. The
site has been subjected to sheetwash and aeolian erosion and has suffered minor disturbance from offroad driving. A small amount of modern debris is scattered around the site, which is estimated to be at
least 76 percent intact.

Site Description
FB 7928 was originally recorded by Whalen (1978:165). He reported a small camp of undetermined affiliation, with three features, one piece of flaked stone, two pieces of ground stone, and two pieces of adobe.
Nearby FB 11448, with which FB 7928 is now merged, was also recorded by Whalen (1978), though not
then designated as a site. This location was defined as a site during a nonfield project (Lukowski 1990a).
This site was composed of one feature with no associated artifacts.
These sites were merged during the current survey, after identifying a continuous distribution of arti2
facts between the reported locations of these sites. As redefined, FB 7928 covers an area of 19,124 m in
27 positive TRUs (Figure 46). Features include a highly disturbed stain, a well-preserved stain, and a
third large stain that is possibly a small structure. Trowel testing proved that the latter two features have
deposits that are at least 10 cm deep. Scattered FCR was also recorded across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter composed of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics was recorded at FB 7928.
Flaked stone includes debitage, a tested cobble, retouched tools, and a hammerstone. An obsidian projectilepoint fragment was recorded but not collected. A mano and undetermined ground stone fragment were
also located at this site. Recorded ceramics include El Paso brownware, which suggests a Formative period
component for the site.
129

130
Figure 46. Site map of FB 7928.

Site Summary
FB 7928 consists of three features and less than 40 artifacts. Although the site is situated within an interdunal area and does exhibit some erosion, overall geomorphic integrity is good, with extensive Q3 deposits evident. A large stain that measures 300 by 300 cm might represent a structure or trash deposit.
At least two of the features have good potential for providing radiocarbon samples. El Paso brownware
sherds suggest a Formative period component. These data could be used to address Formative period research themes, including land use, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 7928 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 7932 (41EP1875)
Site Setting
FB 7932 is situated among 1â2-m-high coppice dunes and associated interdunal blowouts. The landform
slopes very gently west-southwest toward a playa. Approximately half the site is covered by fine aeolian
sands, and the remainder is made up of carbonate nodules mixed with pebble lag gravels that have been
exposed at the surface of eroded interdunal areas. The local vegetation community is dominated by mesquite,
with broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush also present. Surface visibility was estimated to be between
76 and 99 percent. A minimal amount of aeolian and alluvial erosion and light vehicle tracks and military
debris were noted. An estimated 51â75 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 7932 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). The site covered a 200-m area and
included single pieces of FCR and ground stone. In 1994, DOE personnel recorded the site as a prehistoric
cultural scatter (Lukowski 1997). Lithic debitage and tools, ground stone, and scattered FCR were noted.
TRC Mariah revisited the site for testing in 2000 (Baugh et al. 2003). At this time, the site included 20â
30 pieces of flaked stone, a core, and a hammerstone, distributed evenly across the site. Several geomorphological tests were also conducted. The current survey has expanded the boundaries of FB 7932 through
continuous artifacts, so that it now encompasses previously recorded sites FB 7933 and FB 7934. FB 7934
was previously recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). The site was characterized as having three
FCR features and ground stone. Whalen (1978:165) reported FB 7933 to include several hearths and a
single piece of flaked stone.
Presently, FB 7932 consists of three thermal features and a low-density artifact scatter covering an
2
area of 47,594 m with 43 positive TRUs (Figure 47). The features include two moderately disturbed
FCR/burned-caliche concentrations with no deposits and a highly disturbed stain with less than 5 cm of
fill. Additionally, FCR is scattered across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter composed entirely of lithics was observed. Lithic artifacts consist of a variety
of materials and types, including debitage, cores, retouched tools, hammerstones, and several pieces of
ground stone. A single Late Archaic stemmed projectile point was collected (see Appendix G).

131

132
Figure 47. Site map of FB 7932.

Site Summary
FB 7932 is a Late Archaic campsite that consists of several thermal features and an associated low-density
lithic scatter. The site has good geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes in an interdunal
blowout. The FCR concentrations and the ash stain are disturbed, and only one feature has any potential to be
radiocarbon dated. The small lithic assemblage does include a variety of flaked and ground stone artifacts,
with a single Late Archaic projectile point. However, it is dispersed over a large area and does not contain
sufficient information to address any research domains. Therefore, FB 7932 is recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7938 (41EP1868)
Site Setting
This site is situated among 1.5â3-m-high coppice dunes in the Hueco Bolson. Surface sediments in interdunal
areas are a slightly compact fine sandy loam with carbonate nodules and lag gravels exposed at the surface.
Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with smaller numbers of broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush.
Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. Moderate amounts of aeolian and alluvial
erosion and light vehicle traffic and military debris have impacted the site. An estimated 76â99 percent of
the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7938 was initially recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). The site was reported to contain one
FCR feature and a scatter of flaked stone and ground stone. Presently, FB 7938 consists of seven thermal
2
features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of 17,112 m in 22 positive TRUs (Figure 48).
The features are all ash stains; six have a moderate degree of disturbance, and four are minimally disturbed.
All features contain ash and charcoal in their deposits, as proved by trowel testing. Scattered FCR was
recorded across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter consisting entirely of lithic artifacts was recorded at FB 7938. The lithic
artifacts are composed of a variety of materials and include debitage, cores, retouched tools, and ground
stone. No diagnostic artifacts were recorded.

Site Summary
FB 7938 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of thermal features and a low-density
artifact scatter. Although the site is situated among coppice dunes and eroded interdunal blowouts, it has
good geomorphic integrity. All of the stains contain fill with datable materials. There is strong potential
for developing a radiocarbon chronology at this site. There is a light scatter of lithic artifacts that exhibit a
diversity of artifact types. These data could be used to address research themes, including land use, lowdensity/low-intensity occupations, subsistence, and technology. FB 7938 is therefore recommended eligible
for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 7939 (41EP1856)
Site Setting
FB 7939 is situated among dunes in interdunal blowouts. These blowouts have been highly eroded, exposing a
Q3 soil. Surface sediments in the blowouts also include carbonate nodules and lag gravels. Fine to moderately
coarse aeolian sands make up the dunes. Vegetation consists of mesquite and sand sage. Surface visibility
was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. Moderate amounts of aeolian and alluvial erosion and
military surface debris were noted. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7939 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). The site reportedly contained one
FCR feature and a scatter of flaked and ground stone. The current survey has expanded the boundaries of
FB 7939 to include another previously recorded site, FB 11450, originally defined by Lukowski (1997). It
contained one FCR feature and no associated artifacts.
Currently, FB 7939 consists of nine thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area
2
of 40,305 m in 50 positive TRUs (Figure 49). The features are all stains; two have been minimally
impacted by modern disturbances, four have been moderately impacted, and three have been severely
impacted. All of the features contain material suitable for absolute dating. The features have depths of up
to approximately 5 cm. Features contain ash and, in at least one instance, charcoal. Features are distributed
across the site, although two clusters are evident. One of these clusters is in the western portion of the site,
and the other is located slightly northeast of the center of the site. These clusters may represent discrete
activity areas, or they may indicate separate occupations of the area. Scattered FCR was also recorded
across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A moderately dense artifact scatter was recorded at FB 7939 and was composed almost entirely of lithics.
Lithic artifacts were composed of a variety of materials and included debitage, cores, a cobble biface,
retouched tools, and ground stone. The only recorded ceramic was a single Playas Red Textured sherd,
which suggests a Late Formative component for the site. No diagnostic lithic artifacts were observed.

Site Summary
FB 7939 is a Late Formative period camp consisting of numerous thermal features and an associated
moderate-density artifact scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity and is situated among dunes,
with artifacts and features exposed in interdunal blowouts. At least one of the features has charcoal, as
shown by trowel testing. Therefore, the site has excellent chronometric potential. Artifact counts are
significant, and there is a diversity of artifact types represented. These data could be used to address Late
Formative research themes, including land use, logistical use of the basin, site structure, subsistence, and
technology. FB 7939 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 7946 (41EP1886)
Site Setting
FB 7946 is situated in coppice dunes and associated interdunal blowouts (Figure 50). Dunes cap Q3
horizons. Interdunal blowouts contain fine sand and lag gravels. Deflation has exposed a slightly compact
Q3 sandy loam soil beneath the loose blowsands. The local vegetation includes mesquite, sand sage, narrowleaf yucca, and broom snakeweed. Surface visibility is between 76 and 99 percent. The site has been
moderately impacted by aeolian deflation, alluvial erosion, bioturbation, military construction debris, and
off-road vehicle traffic. No more than 25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7946 was originally recorded by Whalen (1978:165) in 1976. He described a single thermal feature
with a scatter of flaked stone artifacts, ground stone, and one El Paso brownware sherd. FB 7946 cur2
rently includes eight features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of 47,261 m with 98 positive TRUs (Figure 51). The rerecorded site is much larger, now incorporating the previously recorded
FB 7947 and FB 11463. FB 7947 was also recorded by Whalen (1978:165). This small site included at
least one hearth with small quantities of flaked and ground stone. Whalen characterized FB 7947 as having low research potential. FB 11463 was defined as a site by Lukowski (1990a) based on Whalenâs survey data. Lukowski reported FB 11463 to have small quantities of flaked and ground stone, but no features or ceramics. Features include three FCR/burned-caliche concentrations and five stains composed of
feature fill. None of these heavily disturbed concentrations possess intact datable deposits. Two of the ash
stains have low levels of disturbance, and three are moderately disturbed. Based on trowel testing, at
137

138
Figure 51. Site map of FB 7946.

least three of the stains contain charcoal flecking. Notably, one of these features also contains calcined
small-mammal bone. Features are widely dispersed across the site. Scattered FCR was also recorded
across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A moderately dense artifact scatter including both lithics and ceramics was recorded at FB 7946. Although overall artifact counts are high, artifacts are dispersed over a large area. Flaked stone artifacts
include one core, a cobble biface, several retouched tools, a hammerstone, abundant debitage, and several
pieces of ground stone, including mano and metate fragments. No temporally or culturally diagnostic stone
tools were recorded. Ceramic types include El Paso Polychrome and El Paso brownware. El Paso Polychrome
ceramics indicate a Late Formative period component for the site.

Site Summary
FB 7946 is, at least in part, a Late Formative site composed of thermal features and a moderately dense
scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts. The site is situated among coppice dunes and eroded interdunal
blowouts. Geomorphic integrity of the site is variable and generally low. However, there are features with
charcoal that probably can provide radiocarbon dates. One feature contains calcined bone and potentially
is a source of unique subsistence data, at least within the scope of this project. The wide distribution of
features probably reflects multiple occupations by different groups over time.
The lithic assemblage includes a variety of flaked and ground stone artifacts that could be used to address research domains of technology and subsistence. The ceramic assemblage is not large but also could
provide data about chronology, technology, and possibly subsistence. There is also potential for obtaining
subsistence data from faunal remains. Therefore, FB 7946 is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7949 (41EP2502)
Site Setting
FB 7949 is situated in wide interdunal blowouts between low coppice dunes. Surface sediments in blowouts
are loose sands mixed with lag pebbles overlying a compacted sandy loam soil visible in eroded areas.
Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, which caps the coppice dunes, with lesser amounts of broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. The site
has been heavily impacted by aeolian and alluvial erosion and military surface debris. An estimated 1â
25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7949 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It contained flaked stone, ground stone,
several cores, and ceramics. The current survey found that the distribution of artifacts connected this
previously recorded site with another previously recorded site, FB 7950. FB 7950 was originally recorded
by UTEP in 1977 (Whalen 1978). It contained one hearth feature and a very light artifact scatter consisting
of flaked stone and ground stone.
2
Currently, FB 7949 consists of thermal features and an artifact scatter covering an area of 26,172 m
in 33 positive TRUs (Figure 52). The features are FCR/burned-caliche concentrations; one is highly
disturbed, and the other is moderately disturbed. Neither of these features contained deposits, and there is
139

140
Figure 52. Site map of FB 7949.

no basis for obtaining absolute dates from this site. Additional scattered FCR was recorded across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A moderately dense artifact scatter was recorded at FB 7949, consisting of lithics and ceramics. Lithic
artifacts include debitage, cores, a tested cobble, scrapers, and ground stone. The only recorded ceramic
type was El Paso brownware. The presence of El Paso brownware suggests a Formative period component
for the site. No diagnostic lithic artifacts were recorded.

Site Summary
FB 7949 is a Formative period campsite consisting of two thermal features and an associated moderatedensity artifact scatter. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity and is situated within wide
interdunal blowouts between coppice dunes. The two features at this site cannot be dated.The site, therefore, does not possess chronometric potential. Conversely, the lithic assemblage does contain a diversity
of flaked and ground stone artifacts that are sufficient to address research domains concerned with technology but cannot be placed within a dated context. FB 7949 is recommended not eligible for listing in
the NRHP.

FB 7957 (41EP1926)
Site Setting
FB 7957 is situated among low coppice dunes with aeolian sand sheets in eroded interdunal areas. Surface
sediments consisted of fine sand, which overlay a compact sandy loam soil across most of the site. Sheetwash
erosion has deflated the features and dispersed artifacts. The local vegetation community is dominated by
mesquite, with lesser amounts of broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush. Surface visibility was estimated
to be between 76 and 99 percent. Moderate amounts of aeolian and alluvial erosion were noted. An estimated
26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7957 was initially recorded in 1976 (Whalen 1978). It contained flaked stone and ground stone items.
The site was revisited by UTEP in 1997 (Lukowski 1997). Lukowski described several clusters of FCR
and one stain, as well as a small scatter of flaked and ground stone.
2
Presently, the site consists of two thermal features and an artifact scatter covering an area of 9,444 m in
12 positive TRUs (Figure 53). The features are a highly disturbed stain and a moderately disturbed stain,
both of which proved to have shallow, dark fill when trowel tested. The features are separated by approximately 60 m, indicating the possibility that they represent discrete activity areas. In addition, a sparse scatter of FCR is present across the site.

Artifacts
The low-density artifact scatter consists of debitage, cores, a uniface, and several pieces of ground stone.
Ceramics were not observed, nor were any diagnostic artifacts.
141

Figure 53. Site map of FB 7957.

142

Site Summary
FB 7957 is a small prehistoric camp of unknown temporal affiliation. It consists of two ash stains and a very
low-density lithic-artifact scatter. The site exhibits low integrity and is located in a coppice-dune field, with
cultural materials visible in eroded interdunal blowouts. The two stains are disturbed and did not have
visible charcoal in their fill. This site has limited potential for providing radiocarbon dates. Although the
lithic assemblage does contain a variety of artifacts, there are too few to address any research domains.
Therefore, FB 7957 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7960 (41EP1940)
Site Setting
FB 7960 is situated among low, 1â2-m-high coppice dunes that gently slope northeast toward a playa.
Surface sediments consist of shallow deposits of fine aeolian sand. In eroded interdunal areas in portions
of the site, a slightly compact sandy loam soil is exposed. The local vegetation community is dominated
by mesquite, with broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush also present. Surface visibility was estimated
to be between 76 and 99 percent. Moderate amounts of aeolian erosion, water erosion, and military surface
debris were noted. An estimated 51â75 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 7960 was originally recorded in 1977 by UTEP (Whalen 1978). At that time, it was reported to contain a
very light scatter of El Paso brownware ceramics, flaked stone, and ground stone. UTEP revisited the site
and reported a scatter of El Paso brownware sherds and a small amount of flaked stone (Lukowski 1997).
2
Presently, the site contains a thermal feature and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of 3,260 m
in four positive TRUs (Figure 54). The feature is a moderately disturbed stain containing 5 cm of deposits
with charcoal flecking. In addition, a sparse scatter of FCR is distributed across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts was recorded at FB 7960. Lithic artifacts were composed of several pieces of debitage. Recorded ceramic types included El Paso brownware and El Paso
Brown. The presence of El Paso Brown ceramics suggests an EarlyâMiddle Formative period component
for the site.

Site Summary
FB 7960 is a very small EarlyâMiddle Formative period campsite consisting of a single stain and a lowdensity artifact scatter. The site is relatively intact and is situated among low coppice dunes sloping gently
toward a playa. The single feature contains intact deposits that could provide absolute dates for the site;
however, the few pieces of debitage and ceramic artifacts do not contain sufficient information to address any
research domains. Therefore, FB 7960 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 8058 (41EP1639)
Site Setting
FB 8058 is situated on a small sand sheet between coppice dunes. Surface sediments are slightly compacted
sand. The sand sheet contains some depth; so, buried deposits are possible but unknown. Vegetation is
dominated by mesquite, with smaller numbers of broom snakeweed and sand sage (Figure 55). Surface
visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. Moderate amounts of aeolian and alluvial erosion
were noted. The site has also been impacted by military tank traffic. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site
remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 8058 consists of two thermal features and an artifact scatter covering an area of 4,391 m (Figure 56).
The features are both highly disturbed stains. Trowel testing revealed charcoal flecking in one of the features. These features are located in the same interdunal blowout, with a light scatter of artifacts present to
the northwest. A small amount of FCR was observed on the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter was recorded at FB 8058. Lithic artifacts included debitage and a core.
El Paso brownware ceramics were also identified. The presence of El Paso brownware suggests a Formative period component at the site.
145

Figure 56. Site map of FB 8058.

146

Site Summary
FB 8058 is a small Formative period campsite consisting of thermal features and a low-density artifact scatter.
The site exhibits moderate geomorphic integrity and is situated on a small sand sheet between coppice
dunes. Potentially, both ash features contain materials suitable for providing absolute dates; however, the
small lithic and ceramic artifact assemblage lacks sufficient potential for addressing any research domains.
Therefore, FB 8058 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 8083 (41EP1928)
Site Setting
FB 8083 is located on slightly elevated land and overlooks a large playa that is located less than 2 km to
the north. This site is long and narrow, extending northwestâsoutheast. It is situated amid low coppice
dunes and interdunal blowouts in an area that gently slopes down toward a fault trough less than 100 m
northeast of the site. Dunes cover approximately one-quarter of the site area. Interdunal blowouts are
partially covered with recent blowsands. Remnants of a sandy Q3 loam are visible around the peripheries
of dunes. Lag gravels on older surfaces are present elsewhere in interdunal areas of the site. Vegetation is
dominated by mesquite, with lesser amounts of broom snakeweed and sand sage. Surface visibility was
estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. Moderate amounts of aeolian and alluvial erosion and military
surface debris were noted. Geomorphic integrity is poor, with less than 25 percent of the site still intact.

Site Description
FB 8083 was originally recorded by Whalen (1978:168). At that time, it reportedly contained two hearths,
flaked stone, ground stone, and some brown ware (Whalen 1978). Lukowski (1997:C-15) revisited the site
years later and recorded two features, a couple dozen pieces of flaked stone, and seven pieces of ground
stone. FCR was recorded in greater abundance. Lukowski (1997:G-11) recommended the site not eligible
for listing in the NRHP.
LMAS reevaluated FB 8083 in 2001 and identified two thermal features, a sparse lithic scatter, debitage,
flaked stone tools, ground stone, and a single El Paso brownware sherd (Church and Stowe 2006). The
site was assigned a Paleoindian period temporal affiliation based on the presence of a Midland-style projectile point (Church and Stowe 2006:Iâ316). In contrast to the previous recommendation, Church and Stowe
(2006) recommended the site eligible for listing in the NRHP.
2
Currently, FB 8083 includes three features with an associated artifact scatter in an area of 47,264 m
in 64 positive TRUs (Figure 57). Features include two FCR/burned-caliche concentrations and a stain
separated by approximately 100 m. The FCR/burned-caliche concentrations are both severely deflated and
lack deposits. The stain has been moderately disturbed; however, the fill contains ash and charcoal flecks
to a depth of 10 cm.

Artifacts
A moderately dense lithic-artifact scatter was recorded at the site. Flaked stone artifacts were composed
of a variety of material types with chert the most-frequently identified. The assemblage includes debitage,
cores, a cobble uniface, and hammerstones. A Midland-style projectile point was previously collected
from this site by Church and Stowe (2006). They also recorded a single El Paso brownware sherd. The
only diagnostic artifacts recorded during the current survey came from a small scatter of historical-period

glass from at least two objects. Cobalt-blue glass dates from ca. 1890 to the present, and aqua glass dates
a visit to the site sometime between ca. 1800 and the 1920s (Horn 2005:1).

Site Summary
Incorporating evidence from past projects, FB 8083 is a multicomponent site with thermal features and a
moderately dense artifact scatter. It exhibits poor geomorphic integrity, situated among coppice dunes and
interdunal blowouts. A single Paleoindian Midland point was collected during previous work at the site.
A single El Paso brownware sherd and several pieces of broken glass are present. The two burned-rock
concentrations lack deposits. The stain has ashy deposits with charcoal and is the only datable feature at the
site. The assemblage primarily contains debitage and has limited potential for addressing research domains.
Therefore, FB 8083 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 9711 (41EP2651)
Site Setting
FB 9711 is located in a coppice-dune setting a short distance east of Loop 375. The site surface dips slightly
toward the west. Dunes that are up to 2 m high cover approximately one-quarter of the site area. Interdunal
blowouts are partially covered by recent aeolian sands. A Q3 soil is well preserved around the margins of
stabilized dunes and presumably below the dunes. This soil is also present in at least some interdunal
areas. Vegetation is confined to the stabilized dunes and includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, fourwing
saltbush, a small amount of yucca, and grasses. Surface visibility is close to 75 percent. The site is considerably disturbed, primarily from aeolian deflation. There is a lesser amount of disturbance from sheetwash erosion, off-road vehicle traffic, and modern traffic. A two-track road encroaches on the west edge
of the site. Geomorphic integrity is fair, with 26â50 percent of the site having intact deposits.

Site Description
This site was first recorded by OâLaughlin (1987) and was described as having one hearth and a lowdensity artifact scatter that included flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics. The ceramics reportedly
included El Paso Polychrome and El Paso brownware. FB 9711 was not among a group of sites that
OâLaughlin (1987) recommended for additional investigations. This site was subsequently evaluated by
Sale (2007). He reported three features, all of which contained flecks of charcoal. Two of these features
were approximately 10 cm in diameter (Sale 2007:5â17). A 1-by-1-m unit excavated along the margin of
a dune produced 81 sherds from the top 10 cm. Sale (2007:5â17) speculated that the site may contain
structural remains and recommended it eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d. The New Mexico
SHPO concurred with this recommendation.
This site was rerecorded during the current survey and the site boundaries redefined, enlarging the
2
site to an area of 5,783 m in 12 positive TRUs (Figure 58). The larger stain was relocated, but the two
smaller stains were not relocated. This moderately disturbed stain contains ash deposits and charcoal to
a depth of 5 cm. Artifacts proved to be most abundant north and west of the relocated feature.

Artifacts
This site has a few pieces of flaked stone, none of which were tools. Chert is the most-often-used material.
Ceramics were more abundant; over 100 El Paso brownware sherds were identified, as were over one dozen
El Paso Polychrome sherds. No ground stone was seen at this site, but a small quantity of FCR was noted.

Site Summary
FB 9711 is a previously recorded site that was recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP (Sale 2007).
This recommendation was concurred with by the New Mexico SHPO. The recommendation was based on
the presence of a possible structure(s). The site is situated among interdunal blowouts that are surrounded
by large coppice dunes and was evaluated as having lowâfair integrity. A single large stain was relocated,
but the two smaller stains were not. The large stain contains charcoal and ash. The ceramics from this site
are sufficient to investigate ceramic technology and also provide a means for relative dating of FB 9711.
FB 9711 is interpreted to be a Late Formative period campsite. This site was previously recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d; SRI concurs with this recommendation.

FB 9804 (41EP2740)
Site Setting
FB 9804 is located in coppice-dune terrain in the Hueco Bolson, only 140 m east of Loop 375. Dunes are
up to 2 m high in this area. Most interdunal areas are covered with a veneer of recent aeolian sands with
lag Rio Grande gravels from the Camp Rice formation. Many or all of the dunes are capping an earlier
soil that is eroded from interdunal areas. The site surface dips gently toward the south. Vegetation includes
mesquite, saltbush, sand sage, and broom snakeweed and occurs almost exclusively on the dunes, which
cover approximately 40 percent of the site area. The site is disturbed by both sheetwash and aeolian erosion.
There is also disturbance from off-road vehicle traffic through the interdunal areas and some recent trash.
Between 26 and 50 percent of the site is considered intact. Several features are beside a regularly used
tank road and subjected to ongoing degradation. This site has good ground visibility.

Site Description
As a consequence of this survey, FB 9804 was merged with another previously recorded site, FB 12150,
2
and the boundaries considerably redefined, with a revised site area of 14,754 m in 17 positive TRUs (Figure 59). FB 9804 was originally recorded by OâLaughlin (1987). He characterized the site as an open
camp with Archaic and Formative period components. In field records for this site, OâLaughlin reports
two features and a modest number of artifacts, several of which were collected. The site was subsequently
revisited during the survey of a military trail (Project 90â17), and the original site area was slightly expanded
(Lukowski 1990a). GMI visited and reevaluated FB 9804 (Sale 2007). Sale (2007:5â19) noted an extremely
low-density lithic and ceramic scatter and two stain features. Because the artifacts were not in proximity
to the features and the artifact density fell well short of site criteria, the site was recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP (Sale 2007:5â21).
FB 12150 was originally recorded in 1990 during a Fort Bliss survey of a proposed tank trail (Lukowski
1990a). The site was reported to contain a low-density artifact scatter with a single FCR feature. Artifacts
included five pieces of flaked stone and seven El Paso brownware sherds. No NRHP-eligibility determination
was made. GMI visited and reevaluated FB 12150 (Sale 2007). Sale (2007:5â41) found one deflated FCR

151

feature and an extremely low-density scatter of artifacts (two pieces of flaked stone and six El Paso brownware ceramics). Because the feature lacked datable deposits and the assemblage was extremely limited, the
site did not meet site-definition criteria and was recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP
(Sale 2007:5â43).
The merged and much-enlarged site is a low-density artifact scatter with eight features (see Figure 59).
Five of the features are clustered in an interdunal area on the southwest edge of the site. All eight features
are stains. Trowel testing established that most of the stains are shallow, although at least two contain charcoal. A scatter of nonfeature FCR was recorded across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter was recorded at FB 9804. Recorded ceramics include El Paso brownware sherds
that were found together in the north part of the site. Lithic artifacts included debitage, retouched flakes,
and a hammerstone.

Site Summary
FB 9804 consists of a Formative period campsite with eight thermal features and a dispersed artifact scatter.
It is situated within an interdunal blowout surrounded by dunes exhibiting fair geomorphic integrity. At
least two of the eight ash stains contain some charcoal. However, there are only a few flaked stone and
ceramic artifacts, including some brown ware sherds. The association of the artifacts with the features is
uncertain, given the dispersed nature of the assemblage and extent of disturbance to the site. Therefore,
FB 9804 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 9807 (41EP2743)
Site Setting
FB 9807 is situated in coppice-dune terrain that dips to the north-northeast at 1â2Â°. Coppice dunes are up
to 2 m high. Interdunal areas have been deflated, exposing a Q3 soil in most areas. There is lag Rio Grande
gravel on this surface and also localized Q4 sand sheets. Vegetation is almost exclusively on the dunes and
consists of mesquite, sand sage, soaptree yucca, broom snakeweed, and fourwing saltbush (Figure 60).
Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. The primary source of disturbance to
the site is sheet erosion. Other sources of erosion are aeolian deflation/reburial and off-road driving. An
estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 9807 was originally recorded in 1986 during a survey associated with construction of Loop 375
(OâLaughlin 1987). It contained six thermal features and an El Paso phase refuse midden located along
the northern boundary of the site, along with a low-density scatter of lithics, ground stone, and FCR. The
thermal features included three charcoal stains and three FCR/burned-caliche features. Based on the ceramic
assemblage, the site was assigned an El Paso phase temporal affiliation. Though no NRHP eligibility determination was made, OâLaughlin recommended that additional work be undertaken at the site (1987).
GMI visited the site during Project 06â55 (Sale 2007). They found an extremely low-density lithic and ce2
ramic scatter and 18 thermal features within an almost 14,000-m area. The refuse midden originally identified
by OâLaughlin (1987) was not relocated, though a relatively high ceramic density was observed in the
153

Figure 60. Overview photograph of FB 9807.

northern portion of the site area (Sale 2007:5â27). The features included FCR concentrations with stains
and what appeared to be a plugged intramural hearth exposed in the roadbed (Sale 2007:5â27). Many of
the stains contained datable deposits. Based on the ceramic assemblage, both Mesilla and El Paso phase
components were identified. Sale (2007:5â27) recommended the site eligible for listing in the NRHP,
under criterion d.
Presently, FB 9807 consists of five thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an
2
area of 10,271 m in 12 positive TRUs (Figure 61). The five features are ash stains ranging from minimally to
highly disturbed, with three containing charcoal, as determined by trowel testing. Four of the features are
clustered within an approximately 30-m radius, with the remaining feature situated farther to the north.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter consisting of lithics and ceramics was recorded. Lithic artifacts included
debitage, a core, retouched tools, and an assortment of ground stone. A nondiagnostic serrated projectilepoint-blade fragment was collected (see Appendix G). Recorded ceramic types included El Paso brownware, El Paso Brown, El Paso Polychrome, and Cloverdale Corrugated. The presence of El Paso Polychrome
suggests a Late Formative period temporal affiliation. El Paso Brown is usually assigned to the Early
or Middle Formative period, though it is possible to have undecorated El Paso ware in the Late Formative. A single soldered hole-in-top can was also recorded. These types of cans were in use from the 1820s
to the 1920s (Horn 2005:4).

Site Summary
FB 9807 is a Late Formative period campsite that potentially contains EarlyâMiddle Formative period
components. The site is composed of five ash stain features and an associated low-density artifact scatter.
It exhibits fair geomorphic integrity, and three features contain ash and charcoal flecking. There is a lowdensity artifact scatter that contains a variety of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramic artifacts. Data
from this site could be used to address Late Formative research themes, including land use, logistical
use of the basin, subsistence, and technology. Sale (2007:5â27) recommended FB 9807 eligible for
listing in the NRHP, under criterion d, and SRI concurs with this recommendation.

FB 11474 (41EP6242)
Site Setting
FB 11474 is situated among low coppice dunes running along a southwestânortheast-trending ridge. This
ridge gently slopes down at 3Â° toward a small playa to the southeast. A larger playa is located northeast of
the site. Surface sediments are characterized by a fine sandy loam with discontinuous sand-sheet deposits.
The local vegetation community is dominated by mesquite, with broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush
also present. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. Moderate amounts of aeolian
and alluvial erosion and military surface debris have affected the site. An estimated 51â75 percent of
the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 11474 was initially recorded by UTEP in 1997 (Lukowski 1997). They reported the site to include
an FCR feature, a stain, and a scatter of artifacts consisting of flaked stone, ground stone, and FCR. The current survey has expanded the boundaries of FB 11474, which now includes the previously recorded FB 11475.
FB 11475 was originally recorded by UTEP in 1997 (Lukowski 1997). It contained one FCR feature and
an artifact scatter that included ground stone, FCR, and flaked stone.
Presently, FB 11474 consists of thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of
2
21,162 m in 30 positive TRUs (Figure 62). The features are composed of two ash stains, one that is moderately disturbed and the other highly disturbed. Trowel testing indicates that both of these features contain
charcoal flecking in shallow, ashy fill. The features are located approximately 45 m from each other, with
an extensive scatter of artifacts and FCR surrounding the features. A moderately dense scatter of FCR is
present across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A moderately dense scatter of artifacts was recorded, though the artifacts were dominated by lithics, with
a small number of ceramics. Lithic artifacts were composed of a variety of materials and included debitage,
a cobble biface, retouched tools, and ground stone. Recorded ceramic types include El Paso decorated and
El Paso brownware, which suggest a Formative period temporal affiliation.

Site Summary
FB 11474 is a Formative period campsite that consists of two thermal features and an associated artifact
scatter. The site exhibits good geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes that cap a ridge
156

Figure 62. Site map of FB 11474.

157

overlooking a playa to the southeast. The two ash stains contain charcoal flecking and are potential sources
of absolute dates. The artifact assemblage is primarily composed of flaked and ground stone items, with a
few ceramics. In spite of the favorable dating potential, this site cannot provide data adequate for addressing
research themes. Therefore, FB 11474 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 11488 (41EP6243)
Site Setting
FB 11488 is situated in coppice-dune terrain. Surface sediments are loose blowsands. Interdunal areas
have been eroded, exposing a paleosol and caliche. Vegetation includes mesquite, sand sage, and broom
snakeweed. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. Moderate amounts of
aeolian and alluvial erosion, bioturbation, and military traffic and debris were noted. An estimated 1â
25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 11488 consists of one thermal feature and no associated artifacts and covers an area of 1,138 m in one
positive TRU (Figure 63). The feature is an ash stain with a low degree of modern impact. A trowel test
revealed large charcoal pieces in the shallow fill. No FCR or artifacts were observed in the vicinity of the
feature.

Site Summary
FB 11488 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. It exhibits low integrity and is situated
among coppice dunes in an interdunal blowout. The site consists of a single ash stain that contains charcoal
that could provide absolute dates; however, no associated artifacts were observed. Therefore, FB 11488 is
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 12079 (41EP6244)
Site Setting
FB 12079 is situated among coppice dunes and eroded interdunal blowouts. Surface sediments consist of
fine to coarse blowsands. Surface sediments in interdunal areas are heavily eroded, exposing carbonate
nodules, lag gravels, and the Q3 compact sandy loam soil. Alluvial action is pronounced, creating incipient
arroyo-like cuts. The local vegetation community includes mesquite, sand sage, fourwing saltbush, broom
snakeweed, soaptree yucca, and bunchgrass. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent.
High degrees of aeolian and alluvial erosion and military surface debris were noted. An estimated 1â25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
Currently, FB 12079 consists of thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of
2
19,711 m in 22 positive TRUs (Figure 64). Thermal features include two FCR/burned-caliche concentrations and five ash stains. Degree of disturbance for the features ranges from high to low, and six of the
158

159

Figure 64. Site map of FB 12079.

160

seven features contain intact, datable deposits, as determined by trowel testing. Four of the features are
tightly clustered in the north, with the other features dispersed across the site. Interdunal blowouts are
highly eroded; so, although there are numerous features exposed, the amount of the site that is intact is
probably not high compared to other sites in the area. Scattered FCR is present across the surface of the
site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter consisting of lithics and a single ceramic sherd was recorded. Lithics were
composed of debitage, a uniface, and ground stone items. The lone recorded ceramic was identified as
Mimbres Black-on-white, indicative of an EarlyâMiddle Formative period component for the site. Ammunition dated from 1918 was also recorded, providing evidence for a historical-period component.

Site Summary
FB 12079 is an EarlyâMiddle Formative period campsite with seven thermal features and a low-density
artifact scatter. The site exhibits low geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes and interdunal
blowouts. The features consist of FCR concentrations and stains, with six of the seven containing datable
fill. A single Mimbres Black-on-white sherd provides evidence for an EarlyâMiddle Formative period
occupation. Artifact counts are very low, lack diversity, and offer no potential to address any research domains. Therefore, FB 12079 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 12084 (41EP6245)
Site Setting
FB 12084 is situated among 1â3-m-high coppice dunes and eroded interdunal areas (Figure 65). Surface
sediments are characterized by loose blowsands, with a compact soil and heavy carbonate gravels exposed
in deflated interdunal areas. Vegetation consists of mesquite, broom snakeweed, sand sage, and soaptree
yucca. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. Impacts include heavy aeolian
deflation and alluvial erosion, with bioturbation and military debris and traffic also present. An estimated
1â25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 12084 was initially recorded by DOE personnel in 1994 (Lukowski 1997). It was reported to contain
one stain and ground stone.
Currently, the site consists of one thermal feature and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of
2
9,867 m in 14 positive TRUs (Figure 66). The thermal feature is a moderately disturbed FCR/burnedcaliche concentration with no deposits. The site contains a moderately dense scatter of FCR.

Artifacts
A low-density scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts was recorded. Lithic artifacts included debitage, cores,
and a retouched flake. Recorded ceramics included a small amount of El Paso brownware, which indicates a
broad Formative period component for the site.
161

Figure 65. Overview photograph of FB 12084.

Site Summary
FB 12084 is a Formative period campsite consisting of a single thermal feature and a sparse scatter of lithic
and ceramic artifacts. The site exhibits low integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within interdunal
blowouts. The single FCR feature is moderately disturbed and does not contain datable materials. In
addition, the site assemblage contains few flaked stone and nondiagnostic ceramic artifacts. Therefore,
FB 12084 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 14593 (41EP5005)
Site Setting
FB 14593 is situated amid widely spaced coppice dunes and highly eroded interdunal blowouts. Surface
sediments consist of loose sand mixed with lag gravels. These surface sediments are overlying a compacted
sandy loam soil that is visible in certain areas because of heavy erosion. Surface visibility was estimated
to be between 51 and 75 percent. High degrees of aeolian and alluvial erosion and military debris were
noted. Previous testing activities have also impacted the site. An estimated 1â25 percent of the site remains
intact.

Site Description
FB 14593 was originally recorded in 1994 (Lukowski 1997). The site was recorded as a prehistoric cultural
2
scatter distributed over 4,722 m . Cultural materials included two thermally burned-rock features, scattered
162

Figure 66. Site map of FB 12084.

163

burned rock, ground stone, flaked stone, and a hammerstone. The site was recommended eligible for
listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.
FB 14593 was revisited and tested in 2000 by TRC (Baugh et al. 2003) and was described as a small
prehistoric campsite with ceramic and lithic artifacts. Field observations verified the presence of two FCR
features. All features were probed with a trowel, and a 50-by-50-cm unit was placed in one feature. Flotation
samples were collected, but recovered materials were insufficient for radiocarbon analysis. Again, the site
was recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP.
2
Currently, the site consists of five thermal features and an artifact scatter covering an area of 9,360 m
with13 positive TRUs (Figure 67). The features consist of two FCR/burned-caliche concentrations and
three ash stains. The FCR/burned-caliche concentrations have both been moderately impacted by modern
disturbances but have deposits to a maximum depth of 10 cm. Charcoal was seen in one of the features
during trowel testing. Of the three ash stains, one has been minimally impacted by modern disturbances,
one has been moderately impacted, and one has been severely impacted. These features have deposits
ranging in depth from 5 to more than 10 cm. Four of the features lie in the portion of the site that has undergone previous testing. Scattered FCR was recorded on the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter consisting of lithic and ceramic artifacts was recorded at FB 14593. Lithic
artifacts include debitage, a core, a tested cobble, ground stone, and a projectile point. A Late Archaic
stemmed point was collected from the site (see Appendix G). Several El Paso brownware sherds were recorded and suggest the site dates broadly to the Formative period. The total artifact count is less than 30.

Site Summary
FB 14593 is a multicomponent site consisting of five thermal features and a low-density artifact scatter.
The site exhibits low geomorphic integrity. It is situated amid widely spaced coppice dunes within interdunal blowouts. A portion of the site has been tested by a previous investigation and recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP. Although the site does contain features with datable materials, there are
only a few artifacts that represent an Archaic and Formative period palimpsest. This assemblage has a
limited potential to address any research domains. Therefore, FB 14593 is recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19358 (41EP6246)
Site Setting
FB 19358 is situated among 1â2-m-high coppice dunes with heavily eroded interdunal areas. Interdunal
areas are eroded down to a paleosol, with carbonate nodules and pebble lag present on the surface. Dunal
surface sediments are loose sand. Vegetation consists of mesquite, broom snakeweed, and sand sage. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. Interdunal areas have been heavily eroded
through aeolian and alluvial processes, with bioturbation and military traffic also sources of disturbance. An
estimated 1â25 percent of the site remains intact.

164

Site Description and Artifacts
2

FB 19358 consists of a single thermal feature and an artifact scatter covering an area of 1,138 m in one
positive TRU (Figure 68). The feature is a highly disturbed ash stain with a single lithic artifact located
nearby. This feature contains potentially datable fill that trowel testing proved to be at least 5 cm deep. No
FCR was observed in the vicinity of the feature. One chert flake was recorded in the vicinity of the feature.

Site Summary
FB 19358 is a very small prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation. It exhibits a low degree of
integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within heavily eroded interdunal blowouts. A highly disturbed, ashy stain was identified, with a single chert flake. The site possibly could be radiocarbon dated but,
without an interpretable assemblage, cannot be used to address any research themes.Therefore, FB 19358 is
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19359 (41EP6247)
Site Setting
FB 19359 is situated among coppice dunes that slope down toward a playa less than 100 m to the east of the
site. Dunes are made up of loose sand. Surface sediments in interdunal areas consist of lag gravels and slightly
compact silty sand. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with lesser amounts of snakeweed, sand sage,
and soaptree yucca. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. Moderate amounts
of aeolian and alluvial erosion were present; military surface debris was also noted. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 19359 consists of thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of 23,562 m in
32 positive TRUs (Figure 69). Features include an FCR/burned-caliche concentration with 10 cm of deposits, and five ash stains, ranging from low to high levels of modern impact. All recorded features contained potentially datable fill with ash and, in at least two instances, charcoal. Several of the features are
fairly large, raising the possibility that they are possibly pit-house remnants. Features are clustered on the
eastern slopes of the site, overlooking a playa to the east. Scattered FCR is present across the surface of
the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter consisting of lithics and ceramics was recorded at FB 19359. Lithic artifacts are
composed of a variety of materials and include debitage, cores, a cobble biface, a tabular knife, a hammerstone, and an assortment of ground stone items. Several El Paso brownware sherds were recorded and
suggest a broad Formative period temporal designation. A womanâs bracelet engraved âJUAREZ OLD
MEXICO 1941 VIRGINIA LEGETâ and a single Canada Dry Root Beer can were also recorded. Flattopped soft drink cans became common after 1953 (Rock 1987:60).

Figure 70. Overview photograph of FB 19360.

Site Summary
FB 19359 is a Formative period site consisting of six thermal features and an associated low-density artifact
scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity and is situated among coppice dunes that slope down toward
a playa less than 100 m to the east. The single FCR concentration and the five ash stains contain datable
deposits with the potential for absolute dating. In addition, several of the stains are quite large and could
possibly be pit houses. The artifact assemblage is limited in size but does contain a variety of lithic types,
though with nondiagnostic ceramics. Data from this site could be used to address Formative period research
themes, including land use, site structure, the seasonal residential use of the basin, subsistence, and technology.
Therefore, FB 19359 is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 19360 (41EP6248)
Site Setting
FB 19360 is situated in low coppice dunes capped by mesquite. Lag gravels and slightly compact sand
make up the surface sediments in interdunal areas. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with lesser
amounts of broom snakeweed, soaptree yucca, and sand sage (Figure 70). Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. A moderate degree of modern erosion and deflation has impacted
the site. Sources of disturbance include aeolian and water erosion and military surface debris. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

169

Site Description
FB 19360 consists of a single thermal feature and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of ap2
proximately 4,500 m in six positive TRUs (Figure 71). The feature is an ash stain that is highly disturbed and retains only shallow deposits of less than 5 cm. A very light scatter of FCR is present across
the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter composed of lithics and ceramics was recorded at FB 19360. Lithic artifacts
were composed of debitage, a core, and a metate fragment. Recorded ceramic types include El Paso brownware and El Paso Brown. The presence of El Paso Brown ceramics indicates an EarlyâMiddle Formative
period component for the site.

Site Summary
FB 19360 is an EarlyâMiddle Formative period campsite consisting of a single thermal feature and an associated low-density artifact scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity and is situated among low coppice
dunes within interdunal blowouts. The ash stain is highly disturbed and has little potential to yield datable
materials. The site assemblage contains few lithics and ceramics and has a low potential to address research
domains. Therefore, FB 19360 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19361 (41EP6249)
Site Setting
FB 19361 is situated in a road cut through a coppice dune. Sediments are slightly compact sand. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with lesser amounts of sand sage, broom snakeweed, and grasses. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. The site has been highly impacted by the
road cut through the dune that contains the feature. Part of the feature remains buried 30 cm below the
surface of the dune. Additionally, aeolian erosion has impacted the exposed portion of the feature. An
estimated 1â25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 19361 consists of a thermal feature and no associated artifacts and covers an area of approximately
2
1,140 m in one positive TRU (Figure 72). The feature is a highly disturbed ash stain containing some
charcoal flecking and organic staining in deposits that are close to 10 cm deep. Otherwise, no FCR was
observed.

Site Summary
FB 19361 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single thermal feature with
no associated artifacts. The site exhibits a low degree of integrity, being situated in a road cut through a
coppice dune. The feature is partially intact but is highly disturbed and exposed by the road cut. There is
170

171

Figure 72. Site map of FB 19361.

172

some charcoal flecking present. No artifacts were observed on the site. Therefore, FB 19361 is recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19362 (41EP6250)
Site Setting
FB 19362 is situated in the middle of a military road that runs through a flat sand sheet. The site is in sand
that has been highly impacted by traffic. Vegetation along the side of the road consists of mesquite, sand
sage, forbs/grasses, broom snakeweed, and soaptree yucca. Surface visibility was estimated at between 51
and 75 percent. The primary disturbance is the road, which has greatly impacted the single feature and
probably removed all other cultural materials. Additionally, aeolian and alluvial erosion have impacted
the exposed feature. An estimated 1â25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 19362 consists of a thermal feature without associated artifacts and covers an area of approximately
2
1,140 m in one positive TRU (Figure 73). The feature is a highly disturbed stain with shallow fill containing charcoal flecking and organic staining. No FCR or artifacts were observed within the vicinity of
this feature.

Site Summary
FB 19362 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single thermal feature with
no associated artifacts. The site exhibits low integrity and is situated in the middle of a military road running
through a flat sand sheet. The ash stain is highly disturbed but could be radiocarbon dated. However, no artifacts were observed in the area of the feature. FB 19362 is therefore recommended not eligible for listing in
the NRHP.

FB 19366 is situated among coppice dunes. Cultural materials are located within interdunal blowouts.
Dunes up to 2.5 m high are present in the site area; dunes cover approximately 25 percent of the site. Interdunal areas are discontinuously covered by thin, active sand sheets. There are also extensive exposed
Q3 horizons in interdunal areas and some locations that have eroded down to older caliche-rich deposits.
Vegetation consists of mesquite, broom snakeweed, soaptree yucca, and fourwing saltbush. Interdunal
areas have almost no vegetation. Overall surface visibility is between 51 and 75 percent. The site is deflated, primarily as a result of aeolian erosion, although some sheetwashing and bioturbation are other
evident sources of site disturbance. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 19366 is composed of three features and several artifacts within an area of 5,977 m . This site includes
five positive TRUs (Figure 77). The features are an ashy stain with low impact and two dark stains subjected to moderate erosional impact, having been truncated by aeolian erosion. Trowel testing demonstrated
that all three features contain charcoal flecks in deposits that are approximately 5 cm deep. The latter two
stains are adjacent to each other in the east side of the site.

Artifacts
Artifacts at this site include a rhyolite scraper and a chert core. Four pieces of FCR, all of which are
Thunderbird metamorphosed rhyolite, were found in the vicinity of the two easternmost features.

Site Summary
FB 19366 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation with three outdoor features, two flaked
stone artifacts, and a small quantity of ground stone. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity. The
features are partially intact and contain dark, ashy sediment with charcoal that could provide material

FB 19367 is situated in coppice-dune terrain a short distance east of Loop 375. The stain composing this
site is located in an interdunal area flanked by dunes that are approximately 1.5 m high and stabilized with
thick vegetation. There is no interdunal plant cover other than isolated broom snakeweed. The dunes cap
Holocene sandy soils that are extensively eroded in interdunal areas, although the feature at this site is
present within a Q3 soil. Much of the area around this feature has a thin cover of recent blowsands. A few
nearby areas have eroded down to pre-Holocene, caliche-rich deposits. Vegetation at FB 19367 is limited
to mesquite, broom snakeweed, soaptree yucca, and fourwing saltbush. Surface visibility exceeds
90 percent across interdunal areas. Disturbance to this site comes primarily from aeolian deflation. Secondary sources of disturbance are sheetwash erosion and some scattered modern trash. The site is considered to be 51â75 percent intact.

Site Description
A single feature was located at FB 19367. This outdoor feature is a shallow stain defined by dark, ashy
fill that contains charcoal flecks. A weakly defined oxidation zone remains around the perimeter of the
feature fill. The feature is exposed in a deflated location, and it clearly has been deflated down so that
only the lower portion remains. There are no artifacts associated with this feature. Including a buffer, this
2
site has an area of 1,140 m with one positive TRU (Figure 78).

Site Summary
FB 19367 is a single outdoor feature that cannot be associated with any other cultural materials. The age
of this feature is unknown. Although fill could be radiocarbon dated, this site cannot provide data to

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter was composed of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramic artifacts. The flaked
stone includes cores, a retouched flake, and debitage. One basalt ground stone fragment was also found.
Recorded ceramic types include a single El Paso Polychrome sherd and El Paso brownware sherds. These
ceramic types indicate a Late Formative period occupation at the site.

Site Summary
FB 19381 consists of two features and a small assemblage of artifacts. Overall, the site exhibits low geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. The two features
are ash stains with good integrity and could yield materials sufficient for radiocarbon dating. On the other
hand, the associated assemblage is small, including a few lithic and ceramic artifacts. The presence of a
single El Paso Polychrome sherd suggests a Late Formative occupation. Nonetheless, the assemblage has
little potential for addressing research domains, especially given the poor context of these artifacts. Therefore, FB 19381 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19382 (41EP6269)
Site Setting
FB 19382 is situated among 2â3-m-high coppice dunes. Interdunal areas have exposed carbonate nodules
and rounded pebble lag gravels at the surface, in areas not obscured by recent blowsands. The dunes cap a
partially preserved Q3 sandy loam. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with broom snakeweed and
fourwing saltbush also present. Surface visibility was estimated to be 76â99 percent. A low degree of
modern erosion and deflation has impacted the site. Sources of disturbance include aeolian erosion, water
erosion, bioturbation, and military debris. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact, and overall
geomorphic integrity is fair.

Site Description
FB 19382 includes a thermal feature and a single artifact. The feature is located on the south edge of a
2
dune in the exposed Q3 soil. The site covers approximately 1,140 m in one positive TRU (Figure 95).
The feature is an ashy stain with shallow, intact deposits. No FCR was observed.

Artifacts
A single piece of andesite angular debris was the only artifact recorded in the vicinity of the feature.

Site Summary
FB 19382 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single feature and
artifact. The site exhibits fair geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes in an interdunal
blowout. The ash stain contains organic staining that potentially could yield charcoal for radiocarbon dating; however, there is only an isolated piece of debitage associated with the feature. Therefore, FB 19382
is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19383 (41EP6295)
Site Setting
FB 19383 is composed of one feature and one piece of flaked stone and is located beside a low coppice
dune. The site setting is coppice-dune terrain, with dunes around the site up to 2.5 m high. Interdunal
areas in and adjacent to the site expose discontinuous Q3 horizons partially obscured by recent blowsands. More-severely deflated areas have scattered caliche nodules intermixed with sands. The feature is
located within a truncated Q3 soil. Vegetation at this site is almost exclusively on dunes and includes
mesquite, fourwing saltbush, and broom snakeweed. Surface visibility in interdunal areas is better than
75 percent. Sources of disturbance to this site include extensive aeolian erosion and minor effects of
military activities. The site is considered to be 51â75 percent intact.

Site Description
FB 19383 is composed of one feature with a nearby piece of flaked stone. This site has one positive TRU
2
and a site area of 1,140 m (Figure 96). The feature is a shallow stain of dark, slightly ashy fill that remains
from an outdoor feature. A trowel test established that the fill includes charcoal flecks.

Artifacts
The one artifact at this site is a chert flake produced by bipolar reduction. The mottled-brown chert has a
waxy luster characteristic of heat-treated rock.

Site Summary
FB 19383 is a small site of unknown age that has one small outdoor feature and one spatially associated
flake. Site geomorphic integrity is fair, and the feature fill evidently could be radiocarbon dated. However,
this site lacks adequate materials for addressing research themes. Consequently, FB 19383 is recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19384 (41EP6270)
Site Setting
FB 19384 is situated among 2â3-m-high coppice dunes. Large portions of the more-extensive interdunal
areas are covered by recent blowsands, although a fine sandy Q3 loam is extensive in areas. This soil is
best preserved closer to stabilized dunes. In more deflated areas, lag gravels with caliche nodules are
present. Plant cover is dominated by mesquite, with smaller areas of broom snakeweed and fourwing
saltbush. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. The site possesses a low degree
of modern erosion and deflation. Impacts to the site include aeolian and water erosion. An estimated 76â
99 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 19384 consists of one feature and an artifact scatter covering an area of approximately 12,650 m across
18 positive TRUs (Figure 97). The feature is a minimally disturbed, ashy stain that contains some charcoal
and ash in 10 cm of fill. The feature is eroding out of the Q3 soil along the northern face of a coppice dune
(Figure 98). Scattered FCR was also visible across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter includes debitage, cores, retouched tools, and a hammerstone. The flaked
stone is made on a variety of rock types. Retouched tools consist of bifaces, a retouched flake, a uniface,
and a collected projectile point. The projectile point is a Late Archaic stemmed point (see Appendix G).
The one piece of ground stone is an indeterminate granite fragment. The scatter also contains several El Paso
brownware sherds.

Site Summary
FB 19384 is a multicomponent campsite with one feature and an associated artifact scatter. The site exhibits
good geomorphic integrity and is situated in a coppice-dune setting within an interdunal blowout. The stain
is intact and could provide materials for radiocarbon dating. Although the artifact assemblage is small, it
does contain a variety of lithic artifact types, including a Late Archaic projectile point. In addition, several
brown ware sherds were also identified. Nonetheless, the potential for these few artifacts to yield information for addressing research domains is limited, and the mixture of Archaic and Formative occupations.
Therefore, FB 19384 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19385 (41EP6296)
Site Setting
FB 19385 is a small site in coppice-dune terrain. The site is located approximately 0.5 km north of a small
playa depression. The site surface dips toward the southwest. Dunes within the site are up to 2.5 m high. The
dunes cover Q3 horizons that are also extensive in interdunal areas of this site. Recent blowsands partially
cover the interdunal areas. In the lower centers of interdunal areas, some caliche nodules and pebble derived
from RÃ­o Grande gravels are present. Vegetation on this site is restricted to mesquite, fourwing saltbush, and
broom snakeweed. Surface visibility is in excess of 75 percent. Aeolian deflation is the primary source of
site disturbance, with lesser effects from bioturbation and military activity. The site is considered to be between 26 and 50 percent intact.

Site Description
2

This site has three positive TRUs and a total site area of 11,700 m (Figure 99). The one feature at
FB 19385 is a small, shallow deposit of fill. This dark stain includes some ash and charcoal flecks. Evidently, only the basal portion of this feature remains.

210

Figure 98. Photograph of Feature 12057 at FB 19384.

Artifacts
The site includes one flake core and one piece of FCR, both of which are located to the northeast of the
feature.

Site Summary
FB 19385 is a small site of unknown age that includes one feature and two stone artifacts. The site has
poor geomorphic integrity. Fill from the one feature at this site could be radiocarbon dated, but this would
not provide results that could be effectively used to address research domains. As this site cannot provide
data adequate for addressing research domains, it is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19386 (41EP6271)
Site Setting
FB 19386 is situated amidst 2-m-high coppice dunes and interdunal areas. Interdunal areas expose a sandy
Q3 loam and caliche gravels. Vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, and sand sage. Surface
visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A moderate degree of modern erosion and
deflation has affected FB 19386. Sources of disturbance include aeolian erosion, sheetwashing, incipient
arroyo formation, bioturbation, recent debris, and a dirt road. Less than 25 percent of the site remains intact.

212

Site Description
2

This site is composed of a single feature and no associated artifacts. It covers approximately 1,140 m in a
single positive TRU (Figure 100). The feature is a moderately disturbed ash stain containing charcoal
flecking. No FCR was observed in the vicinity of the feature.

Site Summary
FB 19386 is composed of a single feature of unknown age and affiliation. The site exhibits a low degree of
integrity and is situated in a coppice-dune setting within an interdunal blowout. The stain is moderately disturbed but does contain charcoal. However, no artifacts were identified in the vicinity of the feature. Therefore, FB 19386 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19387 (41EP6297)
Site Setting
FB 19387 includes remnants from a campfire and four cans, all located in coppice-dune terrain. Dunes
around the site are up to 2 m high. Interdunal areas include extensive recent (Q4) sand sheets on older Q3
horizons. The feature is located in the bottom of slightly stabilized Q4 sands. Vegetation at FB 19387
includes mesquite, fourwing saltbush, narrowleaf yucca, and broom snakeweed. Surface visibility is better that 75 percent. Disturbance to this site includes sheet erosion and modern activity. The site is located
a short distance south of a regularly used dirt road; there are both modern vehicle tracks and scattered
debris, particularly vehicle parts, in the area. This site is considered to be less than 25 percent intact.

Site Description
This site is composed of one deposit of ashy feature fill with charcoal, located in the bottom of Q4 sands,
2
and some associated cans. Materials are confined to a single TRU, resulting in a buffered site area of 1,140 m
(Figure 101). The feature is inferred to be too young for radiocarbon dating. The feature and cans are not
demonstrably military debris and are inferred to be more than 50 years old.

Artifacts
The associated cans are severely corroded from extended exposure but could all be identified as sanitary
cans. The largest of these is a coffee can, and the smallest are meat cans.

Site Summary
FB 19387 is small site that includes one feature and four associated cans. The site probably dates from the
first half of the twentieth century. Site integrity is poor, and there is realistically no additional information
to be obtained from this site. FB 19387 cannot provide data for addressing research domains and is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19388 (41EP6272)
Site Setting
FB 19388 is located in a coppice-dune setting within a large interdunal blowout. The site surface dips toward
the west. Vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, sand sage, and soaptree yucca. The site has
been heavily impacted by aeolian and water erosion, bioturbation, and a minor amount of military traffic
and is less than 25 percent intact. Ground visibility is generally unobstructed.

Site Description
2

The site is composed of an artifact scatter within an approximately 6,800-m area in 10 positive TRUs
(Figure 102). The scatter is confined to deflated interdunal areas; artifacts are not in original contexts. A
very light scatter of FCR was observed across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
The site contains a moderately dense artifact scatter dominated by ceramics. Recorded types include
El Paso Brown, El Paso Polychrome, and El Paso brownware. The El Paso Polychrome sherd was not
found in association with any other sherds. In addition, a single chert biface flake is the only identified
flaked stone artifact.

Site Summary
FB 19388 consists of a Formative period artifact scatter. The site exhibits a low degree of integrity and is
situated in a coppice-dune setting within an interdunal blowout. The majority of the assemblage is composed
of ceramics, including El Paso Brown and brownware sherds; however, a single El Paso Polychrome sherd
attests to a Late Formative occupation. Overall, the site lacks integrity and potential for chronometric dating
and has few artifacts that could provide data necessary for addressing research domains. Therefore, FB 19388
is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19389 (41EP6273)
Site Setting
FB 19389 is situated among low coppice dunes, with extensive interdunal blowouts partially covered by
recent aeolian sands. Lag gravels were also observed lying on top of an older surface. Vegetation includes
mesquite, broom snakeweed, soaptree yucca, and sand sage, in order of decreasing abundance. Surface
visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. The site area has been heavily impacted by aeolian
and alluvial erosion. Military surface debris is also present. A regularly used military road traverses the
west side of the site. Less than 25 percent of FB 19389 remains intact.

Site Description and Artifacts
FB 19389 is composed of a single thermal feature and one associated artifact and covers an area of ap2
proximately 2300 m in two positive TRUs (Figure 103). The thermal feature is a minimally disturbed,

219

ashy stain with charcoal flecks. No FCR was observed in the area of the feature. One rhyolite flake was
identified approximately 20 m southeast of the feature.

Site Summary
FB 19389 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. The site exhibits a low degree
of integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. A single intact stain was
recorded and has charcoal suitable for chronometric dating; however, a single flake was the only artifact
observed in the area. This site cannot produce data for effectively addressing research issues. Therefore,
FB 19389 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19390 (41EP6274)
Site Setting
FB 19390 is situated in a coppice-dune setting (Figure 104). Interdunal blowouts are extensively covered
by recent aeolian sands. Extensive deflation has exposed lag gravels in some interdunal areas. Vegetation
includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, and soaptree yucca. Surface visibility was estimated to be between
76 and 99 percent. The site has been highly impacted by aeolian and alluvial processes, with other disturbance
sources including bioturbation and military surface debris. A utility road runs along the east side of FB 19390.
Less than 25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 19390 includes a thermal feature and associated artifact scatter covering an area of approximately
2
13,500 m in 21 positive TRUs (Figure 105). The feature is a highly disturbed FCR/burned-caliche concentration without deposits. It contains approximately a dozen FCR fragments and is located on the western edge of the site. In contrast, the surface artifact scatter primarily extends toward the northeast and
southeast. Erosion has severely scattered the artifacts and FCR at the site.

Artifacts
A moderately dense artifact scatter composed of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics was recorded.
Flaked stone artifacts were composed of a variety of materials and several artifact types, including debitage,
cores, and retouched tools, with one tabular knife. Ground stone items consist of a metate fragment and
indeterminate ground stone fragments. El Paso brownware sherds were recorded, indicating a Formative
period temporal affiliation.

Site Summary
FB 19390 is a Formative period site composed of a single feature and an associated artifact scatter including
lithics and ceramics. The site has low geomorphic integrity and is situated within an interdunal blowout. The
single FCR/burned-caliche feature does not have intact deposits or the potential to yield datable materials.
A moderately dense artifact scatter is present, containing a diverse assemblage of flaked stone and ground
stone, with some El Paso brownware. Although this assemblage might provide sufficient data to address

220

research questions, it cannot be placed within an absolute temporal context. Therefore, FB 19390 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19391 (41EP6275)
Site Setting
FB 19391 is situated in coppice dunes and interdunal terrain approximately 300 m west of a military dirt
road. The site is on the west-facing slope of a slight rise approximately 500 m north of a small playa basin.
Interdunal surface sediments are loose sand mixed with lag-gravel inclusions. Vegetation is dominated by
mesquite, with lesser amounts of fourwing saltbush, snakeweed, sand sage, and bunchgrass. Surface visibility
was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. The site has been appreciably impacted by aeolian and
water erosion, and only an estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 19391 consists of a light scatter of artifacts in five positive TRUs that cover an area of approximately
2
4,150 m (Figure 106). The artifacts rest on deflated surfaces between dunes and are out of context. No
features were observed at the site; however, there is a modest quantity of dispersed FCR present.

221

222

Figure 106. Site map of FB 19391.

223

Artifacts
The artifact assemblage includes a light-density scatter with one chert flake and ceramics. El Paso brownware and El Paso Polychrome were identified. El Paso Polychrome ceramics indicate a Late Formative
period temporal affiliation.

Site Summary
FB 19391 is a small Late Formative period campsite consisting of a light scatter of artifacts. The site
exhibits fair geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. No
features were observed, and no datable deposits were evident. In addition, the few identified artifacts do
not have the potential to yield sufficient information to address research domains. Therefore, FB 19391 is
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19392 (41EP6276)
Site Setting
FB 19392 is situated along the south and east sides of two coppice dunes. This location is on the west flank
of a slight rise in elevation, with aspect toward the west. The dunes exceed 2 m in height. The small artifact
scatter is in an interdunal area that includes lag gravels and caliche fragments on a deflated, carbonatehardened surface. In descending abundance, vegetation includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, fourwing
saltbush, and Torrey yucca, with a few forbs and grasses. Disturbance has been caused primarily by aeolian
erosion, although sheetwashing and off-road traffic have also affected the site, which is estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent intact.

Site Description
FB 19392 contains a low-density scatter of artifacts within a blowout encircled by several dunes. The site
2
covers an area of approximately 1,660 m in two positive TRUs (Figure 107). No features or scattered FCR
were observed. The site does not contain any materials suitable for absolute dating.

Artifacts
The assemblage at FB 19392 includes one obsidian flake and a scatter of ceramics. The sherds are El Paso
brownware and are from at least two vessels.

Site Summary
FB 19392 is a small Formative period campsite that consists of a low-density artifact scatter. The site
exhibits a high degree of integrity and is situated in a coppice-dune setting within an interdunal blowout.
Given the lack of features and subsurface deposits, there is no way to precisely date this site. In addition,
the few artifacts do not have the potential to yield sufficient information for addressing research domains.
Therefore, FB 19392 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19393 (41EP6277)
Site Setting
FB 19393 is situated amid low, incipient coppice dunes. Interdunal areas are a highly eroded compact
sandy Q3 loam. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with broom snakeweed, soaptree yucca, sand sage,
and fourwing saltbush also present. Only the broom snakeweed grows off the dunes at this site. Surface
visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. The site has been highly impacted by aeolian deflation and alluvial erosion. Less than 25 percent remains intact.

Site Description
2

This site covers an area of approximately 2,800 m in three positive TRUs (Figure 108). This site has three
isolated features located between dunes, within approximately 40 m of each other. The features are ashy
stains, ranging from moderate to high levels of modern disturbance. All the stains have approximately
5 cm of fill, and two of the stains contain charcoal flecking. No FCR fragments or artifacts were observed
in the vicinity of the features.

Site Summary
FB 19393 is a small campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. The site exhibits a low degree of integrity
and is situated in a coppice-dune setting within an interdunal blowout. Three relatively intact stains were
recorded, with two of the features containing charcoal flecks; however, no artifacts were observed in association with the features. Although the features do have the potential to be radiocarbon dated, the lack of
artifacts restricts the data potential of the site. Therefore, FB 19393 is recommended not eligible for listing
in the NRHP.

FB 19394 (41EP6278)
Site Setting
FB 19394 is situated in a coppice-dune setting, with stabilized dunes that are up to 2 m in height. Interdunal
blowouts are heavily eroded. Interdunal surface sediments are loose blowsands, with a Q3 soil and caliche
gravels visible in some deflated areas of blowouts (Figure 109). In descending order of abundance, vegetation
includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, and sand sage. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76
and 99 percent. The site has been moderately impacted by aeolian deflation, alluvial erosion, bioturbation,
off-road military traffic, and debris. Less than 25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 19394 consists of one isolated feature and no associated artifacts and covers an area of approximately
2
1,140 m in one positive TRU (Figure 7.110). The feature is a highly disturbed ash stain that does retain
charcoal flecking in deposits that are less than 5 cm deep. No FCR was observed in the vicinity of the
feature.

226

Figure 108. Site map of FB 19393.

227

Figure 109. Overview photograph of FB 19394.

Site Summary
FB 19394 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. The site exhibits poor geomorphic
integrity and is situated in a coppice-dune setting within interdunal blowouts. The single feature is a
highly disturbed ash stain that does have some charcoal. No artifacts are present, which restricts the data
potential of the site. Therefore, FB 19394 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19395 (41EP6298)
Site Setting
FB 19395 is located in the lower Hueco Bolson, in an area with several nearby fault-trough playas. The
site surface dips slightly to the south. Dunes cover approximately 15 percent of the site area and are up to
2 m high. There are Q3 deposits around the peripheries of dunes. The central portions of interdunal areas
are more severely deflated and typically have recent blowsands intermixed with caliche nodules on moreoxidized, pre-Holocene sediments. The two features and sherds at this site are associated with Q3 deposits. Vegetation at this site includes mesquite, fourwing saltbush, narrowleaf yucca, and broom snakeweed.
Interdunal areas have no vegetation other than isolated broom snakeweed. Surface visibility is better than
75 percent. Disturbance to FB 19395 comes from aeolian deflation, sheetwash erosion between dunes,
and off-road driving. Portions of the site are severely deflated, and the site is considered to be 26â50 percent intact.

228

Figure 110. Site map of FB 19394.

229

Site Description
2

FB 19395 includes five positive TRUs and a buffered site area of 8,065 m (Figure 111). There are two
features, a small concentration of El Paso brownware sherds from a single vessel, and one piece of angular debris. The features are small stains of dark fill about 5 cm deep, left from outdoor burning. Fill in both
features includes some ash and charcoal flecking.

Artifacts
The four artifacts found at this site are two El Paso brownware sherds, one other plain ware sherd, and
one piece of flaked stone.

Site Summary
FB 19395 includes two small stains in the north part of the site and a modest quantity of nearby artifacts.
The plain sherds are in the same stratigraphic context as the two features, and contemporaneity is possible,
although unproved. Fill from both features contains charcoal; these features have the potential to be radiocarbon dated. In spite of this potential, the site cannot provide adequate data for effectively addressing research domains without charcoal fragments large enough to investigate research domains related to subsistence
and with no additional cultural materials other than a dispersed smattering of artifacts. FB 19395 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19396 (41EP6299)
Site Setting
FB 19396 is a small site located in a coppice setting. The site is on a slope that dips lightly to the west
toward a small playa about 700 m west of FB 19369. Dunes cover approximately 20 percent of the site
area and are up to 2 m high. The dunes cover Q3 horizons that also extend into interdunal areas. Recent
blowsands partially obscure these deposits. Central portions of interdunal areas are more severely deflated,
and there is incipient channelization draining toward the south-southwest. The plant cover at this site includes mesquite, fourwing saltbush, narrowleaf yucca, and broom snakeweed. Overall surface visibility at
this site exceeds 75 percent. Portions of this site are severely deflated from aeolian activity. Lesser sources
of site disturbance include water erosion and a small quantity of scattered military debris. Between 26 and
50 percent of FB 19396 is intact.

Site Description
2

This site covers a buffered area of 7,102 m and includes five positive TRUs (Figure 112). The site includes two features, two fragments of ground stone, and two pieces of flaked stone. The features are stains
that are gradually eroding away with surrounding deposits. The northern feature of the two has dark fill
with ash and some charcoal flakes in at least 5 cm of fill. The perimeter of the feature is slightly oxidized.
The other feature is almost entirely eroded and less than 5 cm deep. Remaining fill is slightly ashy, but no
charcoal was observed.

232

Artifacts
Two pieces of flaked chert were found in this site. There are also several pieces of FCR.

Site Summary
FB 19396 is an undated site composed of two small features and a few artifacts. Fill from one of the
features may be possible to radiocarbon date. The site retains no more than fair geomorphic integrity.
With only two small, somewhat eroded features and a total of four artifacts, this site cannot produce
adequate data for investigating research domains. As a result, FB 19396 is recommended not eligible for
listing in the NRHP.

FB 19397 (41EP6279)
Site Setting
FB 19397 is situated amid coppice dunes capped by mesquite and interdunal blowouts. Surface sediments
are loose blowsand with lag gravels in interdunal areas. In some blowouts, portions of a sandy loam Q3
soil are visible. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with lesser amounts of snakeweed and fourwing saltbush. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. Moderately extensive aeolian and
water erosion has impacted the site; military surface debris is also present. An estimated 26â50 percent of
the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 19397 consists of two features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of 6,113 m in
six positive TRUs (Figure 113). The features are both stains located between dunes. One of these is
highly disturbed, and the other is minimally disturbed. The latter feature contains charcoal flecking
and has deposits of at least 5 cm in depth. A very low-density scatter of FCR is present across the surface of the site, although no FCR is associated directly with the features.

Artifacts
A very low-density scatter of lithic artifacts was recorded. Flaked stone artifacts include debitage and a
core. No ceramics or ground stone artifacts were observed.

Site Summary
FB 19397 is a small campsite of unknown age and affiliation. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity
and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. One ash stain is relatively intact and
has charcoal; however, there are too few artifacts to address research domains. Therefore, FB 19397 is
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19398 is situated among coppice dunes, with three features located within eroded interdunal blowouts.
Interdunal areas include a Q3 soil and more-deeply eroded areas with carbonate nodules and lag gravels.
Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with lesser amounts of saltbush, broom snakeweed, sand sage, forbs,
and grasses. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A moderate degree of erosion
and deflation has impacted this site. Sources of disturbance include aeolian and water erosion and military
surface debris. Between 51 and 75 percent of this site remains intact.

Site Description and Artifacts
2

This site includes three features and a single artifact and covers an area of approximately 3,500 m in four
positive TRUs (Figure 114). These features are concentrated in a tight cluster in an interdunal area east of
several dunes. The features are stains subjected to moderate or high levels of impact. Trowel testing revealed that they have deposits up to about 5 cm deep; only one feature had visible charcoal. Several pieces
of FCR were also observed, and a single chert biface flake was recorded in the area around the features.

Site Summary
FB 19398 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation that consists of several features and a
single artifact. The site exhibits a high degree of geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice
dunes within an interdunal blowout. The three features are eroded stains. A single biface was the only
artifact observed in the vicinity of the features. This site has limited potential to provide chronometric
or artifact data for addressing research questions and is therefore recommended not eligible for listing in
the NRHP.

FB 19399 (41EP6281)
Site Setting
FB 19399 is located in a coppice-dune setting, with most of the interdunal areas covered by recent aeolian
sands mixed with lag gravels. A Q3 soil is discontiguously preserved. Mesquite is the most abundant plant,
with broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush present in lesser amounts. Vegetation is primarily confined
to stabilized dunes. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. A high degree of modern
erosion and deflation has impacted the site. Disturbance sources include aeolian deflation and alluvial erosion.
At most, 25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 19399 has a single thermal feature located in an interdunal area. No associated artifacts were identified.
2
The site covers an area of approximately 1,140 m in one positive TRU (Figure 115). The feature is a
poorly preserved stain that does contain charcoal in about 5 cm of fill. No FCR was associated with the
feature.

Site Summary
FB 19399 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation that consists of a single feature. The
site exhibits a low degree of integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout.
The feature is a poorly preserved stain with some charcoal and some potential for yielding datable materials. In addition, no artifacts were observed in the area of the feature. Therefore, FB 19399 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19400 (41EP6300)
Site Setting
FB 19400 is situated among coppice dunes east of a playa. The site surface dips slightly to the west toward
this playa. The one feature at FB 19400 is located between coppice dunes that are up to 1.5 m high. The
dunes rest on Q3 deposits and also extend out into interdunal areas. The interdunal areas are heavily deflated, exposing much older sediments that are only discontinuously covered with recent blowsands. The
one feature at this site is intrusive into Q3 deposits. Vegetation includes mesquite, fourwing saltbush, and
broom snakeweed. Interdunal areas are almost devoid of vegetation. Surface visibility exceeds 75 percent.
Sources of disturbance to the site are aeolian deflation, sheetwashing, a smattering of military debris, and
minor bioturbation. The site is between 26 and 50 percent intact.

Site Description
2

FB 19400 is composed of a single small feature in one positive TRU. The buffered site area is 1,140 m
(Figure 116). The feature is a small stain of fill left from an outdoor feature; there are no nearby artifacts.
The dark fill contains some ash and charcoal flecking in 5 cm of fill. The feature edges are indistinct,
suggesting some bioturbation. This feature can be radiocarbon dated.

Site Summary
This site includes one feature with deposits that possibly could be radiocarbon dated. Without associated
cultural materials a date alone could not be used to address research domains. There are no other archaeological materials with which this feature can be associated, and the site cannot provide data for addressing
research themes. Therefore, FB 19400 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19403 (41EP6282)
Site Setting
FB 19403 is situated among 1.5-m-high coppice dunes. In many places, interdunal areas retain a Q3 soil.
Less-extensive interdunal areas have lag gravels. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush also present. As is the case throughout much of the area, vegetation is largely
confined to stabilized dunes. Surface visibility was estimated to be 51 and 75 percent. A moderate degree
of modern erosion and deflation has impacted the site. Sources of disturbance include aeolian and water
erosion and military surface debris. An estimated 51â75 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 19403 is a low-density artifact scatter covering an area of approximately 2,200 m in three positive
TRUs (Figure 117). Artifacts are scattered on the deflated surface between the dunes. No features or
FCR were observed.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter containing flaked stone and ceramics was recorded. Most of the flaked stone
artifacts are made of chert. Pieces of debitage and a core were identified. El Paso brownware ceramics were
also recorded. The presence of El Paso brownware indicates a broad Formative period temporal affiliation
for the site.

Site Summary
FB 19403 is a small Formative period campsite that contains a low-density flaked stone and ceramic scatter.
The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity and is situated among coppice dunes in an interdunal blowout.
Although no features were observed at the site, a dispersed scatter of flaked stone and ceramic artifacts
were recorded. Nonetheless, these artifacts cannot be placed in a temporal context and do not contain the
potential for yielding data for addressing research domains. Therefore, FB 19403 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19404 (41EP6283)
Site Setting
FB 19404 is situated among low coppice dunes at the eastern margin of a small playa. Within interdunal
areas, a Q3 fine sandy loam is preserved, although it is obscured in places by recent aeolian sands. Vegetation
is dominated by mesquite, with lesser amounts of broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush. Surface visibility
was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A high degree of erosion and deflation has impacted the
site. Disturbance sources include wind and water erosion and off-road vehicle traffic. A pipeline road along
the western site boundary has severely impacted the site. In spite of this disturbance, 51â75 percent of the
site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 19404 includes thermal features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of approximately
2
11,500 m in 16 positive TRUs (Figure 118). Features are distributed in two pairs, located approximately
40 m apart. Features include three FCR/burned-caliche concentrations and an ash stain. All of the features
are highly disturbed; however, trowel tests revealed charcoal in two of the features with deposits at least
5 cm deep. Two of the FCR/burned-caliche concentrations contain 30 pieces of associated FCR. The third
feature contains 35 pieces of FCR. Figure 119 shows Feature 6234, which is one of the FCR concentrations. Isolated pieces of FCR were also identified across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics was recorded at FB 19404. The
flaked stone items included a core, tested cobbles, and debitage. Ground stone artifacts included manos
and undetermined fragments. A single El Paso brownware sherd was recorded and broadly dates the site to
the Formative period.

Site Summary
FB 19404 is a Formative period campsite that consists of several features and an associated low-density
artifact scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice
dunes within an interdunal blowout. At least two of the four features at this site contain charcoal in their
fill; one feature lacks deposits. The site assemblage contains a few artifacts and also has a low potential for
addressing research domains. Therefore, FB 19404 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19406 (41EP6284)
Site Setting
FB 19406 is situated among coppice dunes that do not exceed 2 m in height. Interdunal areas are partially
covered with recent aeolian sands. Areas of slightly compacted fine sandy Q3 loam and more heavily eroded
areas with carbonate nodules and rounded-pebble lag gravels also exist. Mesquite dominates, although
broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush are also present. Surface visibility was estimated to be between
243

76 and 99 percent. A low degree of modern erosion and deflation has impacted the site, with wind and
water erosion the disturbance sources. An estimated 51â75 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 19406 is a low-density artifact scatter within an area of approximately 3,200 m in 4 positive TRUs
(Figure 120). The scatter is preserved in a small blowout between several dunes. No features were
observed at the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter was recorded at FB 19406. Artifacts consist of a hammerstone and a small
concentration of El Paso brownware, El Paso Bichrome, and El Paso Polychrome ceramics. The presence
of these types of ceramics indicates a MiddleâLate Formative period occupation.

Site Summary
FB 19406 is a Late Formative period campsite composed of a low-density artifact scatter. The site exhibits a
fair degree of integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. No features were
observed, and absolute dating is not possible. The small size of the artifact assemblage restricts the data
potential for addressing research domains. Therefore, FB 19406 is recommended not eligible for listing
in the NRHP.

FB 19407 (41EP6285)
Site Setting
FB 19407 is situated among low coppice dunes near the margin of a small playa. Interdunal areas are heavily
deflated, especially nearer to the playa margin. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with broom snakeweed
and fourwing saltbush also present. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A
moderate degree of erosion and deflation has impacted the site. Sources of disturbance include sheetwash
erosion and aeolian deflation. An estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 19407 is composed of a thermal feature with no associated artifacts. The feature is located on the
northeast edge of a dune where a Q3 soil is partially preserved. The site covers an area of approximately
2
1,140 m in one positive TRU (Figure 121). The feature is a highly disturbed ash stain with charcoal
flecking in 5 cm of dark fill. No FCR was observed on the site.

Site Summary
FB 19407 is a small campsite of unknown temporal affiliation with a single feature. The site exhibits a
fair degree of integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. A single highly

disturbed stain with potential to yield datable materials was recorded. However, no artifacts were observed
in the vicinity of the feature. Therefore, FB 19407 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19408 (41EP6286)
Site Setting
FB 19408 is situated among low coppice dunes near the margin of a small playa. More-extensive interdunal
areas are partially covered by recent aeolian sands, although there are also areas where a Q3 soil is preserved.
Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with lesser amounts of broom snakeweed, fourwing saltbush, and
grasses. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A low degree of modern erosion
and deflation has impacted the site. Sources of disturbance include aeolian erosion, water erosion, and light
vehicle tracks. An estimated 51â75 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description and Artifacts
2

FB 19408 includes one feature and one artifact within an area of approximately 1,140 m in one positive
TRU (Figure 122). The feature is a highly disturbed ash stain that contains charcoal flecking and organic
staining in deposits of less than 5 cm. It is visible along the southeast edge of a small dune. No FCR was
observed in the vicinity of the feature, but a single obsidian flake was observed. Obsidian nodules from
Rio Grande gravels are locally abundant.

Site Summary
FB 19408 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single feature
and one flake. The stain is highly disturbed but has potential for yielding datable materials. The single
flake cannot provide information relative to addressing research domains. Therefore, FB 19408 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19409 (41EP6287)
Site Setting
FB 19409 is situated among low coppice dunes with interdunal sand sheets. Interdunal areas are extensively
covered by recent sands. Vegetation consists of mesquite, fourwing saltbush, Torrey yucca, sand sage, and
grasses. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A moderate degree of aeolian
deflation and redeposition has impacted the site, along with some sheetwashing. An estimated 51â75 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 19409 includes features and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of approximately 5,100 m
in seven positive TRUs (Figure 123). The features include two FCR/burned-caliche concentrations that
are approximately 40 m apart. One is highly disturbed and lacks deposits. The other feature is moderately
disturbed, with a trowel test revealing charcoal and ashy sediment up to 3 cm below the surface. This
latter feature includes 25 fragments of associated FCR. Isolated FCR are also distributed across the site.

Artifacts
A very low-density scatter of flaked stone was recorded, consisting of debitage, a core, and a uniface. No
diagnostic artifacts or ceramics were observed.

Site Summary
FB 19409 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of two thermal features
and a low-density artifact scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of integrity and is situated among coppice
dunes within an interdunal blowout. The FCR/burned-caliche concentrations are moderately to highly disturbed and have a low potential to yield datable materials. Too few artifacts are present to address research
domains. Therefore, FB 19409 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19410 (41EP6288)
Site Setting
FB 19410 is situated among low coppice dunes up to 1.5 m high. Interdunal areas are deflated, exposing a
slightly compact fine sandy Q3 loam and, in more severely deflated areas, carbonate nodules and roundedpebble lag gravels resting on older deposits. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with broom snakeweed
and fourwing saltbush also present. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent. A
low degree of aeolian erosion and deflation was observed. Sheetwash is a secondary source of site erosion.
Between 26 and 50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

This site has one small feature and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of approximately 1,140 m
in one positive TRU (Figure 124). The feature measures 50 by 50 cm and is a moderately disturbed ash
stain. A trowel test into feature deposits revealed charcoal flecking within the 5-cm-deep ash stain (Figure 125). No FCR was observed in the vicinity of the feature.

Artifacts
FB 19410 contains a very low-density artifact scatter, composed of lithics and ceramics. Recorded ceramics
include El Paso brownware and El Paso Polychrome. The single flaked stone artifact is an undetermined
limestone flake. The presence of El Paso Polychrome ceramics reflects a Late Formative period component
for the site.

Site Summary
FB 19410 is a small Late Formative period campsite with one roasting feature and an associated lowdensity artifact scatter. Feature deposits contain charcoal, although obtaining a date from this feature is
impractical, as there are so few associated artifacts. This site lacks the data potential for addressing research
themes. Accordingly, FB 19410 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19411 (41EP6289)
Site Setting
FB 19411 is situated in a coppice-dune setting, with dunes up to 2 m high. Interdunal areas have recent
sands in some areas. Elsewhere, the interdunal surface is a compact fine sandy Q3 loam or a lag deposit of
carbonate nodules and rounded gravels. Onsite vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with lesser amounts
of broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush, and is almost exclusively located on the dunes. Surface visibility
was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. A low degree of modern erosion and deflation has impacted
the site. Sources of disturbance include aeolian and water erosion. An estimated 51â75 percent of the site
remains intact.

Site Description
2

This site is a low-density artifact scatter covering an area of approximately 3,250 m in four positive TRUs
(Figure 126). No features or potentially datable materials were observed. Artifacts were found in three
adjacent interdunal areas. The artifacts are dispersed across the site.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics was recorded. Lithic artifacts
are composed of a variety of materials; the most abundant flaked stone artifacts are chert flakes. The two
pieces of ground stone are a mano fragment and an indeterminate fragment. Ceramic types consist of El Paso

253

Figure 127. Overview of FB 19412.

brownware and El Paso Polychrome. The presence of El Paso Polychrome indicates a Late Formative period
date for the site.

Site Summary
FB 19411 is a small Late Formative period campsite composed of a low-density artifact scatter. No features
or datable materials were observed; so, there is no potential for absolute dating of this site. The assemblage
contains only a few lithic and ceramic artifacts and cannot contribute to addressing research domains.
Therefore, FB 19411 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19412 (41EP6290)
Site Setting
FB 19412 is situated in mature coppice dunes that are up to 3 m high (Figure 127). Interdunal areas are
deflated, exposing carbonate nodules and rounded-pebble lag gravels. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite,
with broom snakeweed and fourwing saltbush also present. Surface visibility is estimated to be between
76 and 99 percent. Moderate degrees of modern erosion and deflation have impacted the site. Sources of
disturbance include aeolian deflation and reburial and sheetwashing. An estimated 76â99 percent of the
site remains intact.

254

Site Description
FB 19412 includes a thermal feature and a small scatter of artifacts covering an area of approximately
2
1,140 m in one positive TRU (Figure 128). The feature is an FCR/caliche concentration that is moderately
disturbed but does contain pieces of charcoal, charcoal flecking, and staining in shallow deposits (Figure 129). Several dozen pieces of FCR are present across the site surface and probably originated from the
feature.

Artifacts
Two sandstone ground stone fragments were identified. No temporally or culturally diagnostic artifacts
were present.

Site Summary
FB 19412 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation, consisting of one feature, scattered
FCR, and two pieces of ground stone. The moderately disturbed FCR/caliche concentration retains deposits
with charcoal and staining; however, the two pieces of associated ground stone would provide little data
for addressing research domains. Therefore, FB 19412 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19413 (41EP6291)
Site Setting
FB 19413 is situated among coppice dunes that are up to 2 m high and in eroded interdunal areas. Interdunal
areas have a Q3 soil and caliche exposed where recent surface sands do not conceal them. Vegetation
includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, sand sage, and soaptree yucca. Surface visibility is estimated to be
between 76 and 99 percent. Sources of modern disturbance include aeolian erosion, water erosion, bioturbation, and military traffic and debris. An estimated 1â25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

FB 19413 has three thermal features and a scatter of FCR and covers an area of approximately 2,000 m in
two positive TRUs (Figure 130). The features are clustered together within the same interdunal blowout. The
stains exhibit moderate to high degrees of disturbance, with all containing charcoal flecking. Depths of fill
in these features are around 5 cm. A very light scatter of FCR was recorded southeast of the features, but
no artifacts were observed in the vicinity of the features.

Site Summary
FB 19413 is small prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of three thermal features and a
light scatter of FCR. The site exhibits low geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within
an interdunal blowout. The three stains are moderately to highly disturbed but do contain some charcoal.
However, no artifacts were observed in the area of the features. This site cannot provide suitable data for
addressing research themes.

FB 19414 (41EP6292)
Site Setting
FB 19414 is visible in interdunal areas between coppice dunes. Interdunal surface sediments are loose or
semicompact sand mixed with lag pebbles derived from Rio Grande gravels. Vegetation includes mesquite,
broom snakeweed, and fourwing saltbush. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 51 and 75 percent.
The site has been highly impacted by aeolian deflation and sheetwash erosion, with lesser amounts of disturbance from bioturbation and military surface debris. No more than 25 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
FB 19414 includes two shallow stains and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of approximately
2
9,500 m in 10 positive TRUs (Figure 131). The features are small highly disturbed stains that are located
approximately 15 m apart. These features have only shallow deposits and lack charcoal. The artifact scatter extends to the southeast of the features.

Artifacts
A low-density artifact scatter of ceramic and lithic artifacts is present on the surface of the site. Lithic artifacts included debitage, several cores, a retouched flake, and undetermined ground stone. A single El Paso
brownware sherd was identified. The Formative period sherd is the only temporally diagnostic artifact
from the site.
257

Figure 130. Site map of FB 19413.

258

Figure 131. Site map of FB 19414.

Site Summary
FB 19414 is a Formative period campsite with two thermal features and an associated artifact scatter. The
site exhibits poor geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout.
The two ash stains are relatively small and highly disturbed, with little potential for yielding datable materials. The artifact assemblage is too small to provide data for addressing research questions. Therefore,
FB 19414 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19415 (41EP6293)
Site Setting
FB 19415 is situated among low coppice dunes and interdunal areas. Surface sediments in interdunal areas
consist of shallow aeolian fine sands, which cover a slightly compact sandy loam soil, and lag gravels that
are exposed in deflated areas. Vegetation is dominated by mesquite, with broom snakeweed and fourwing
saltbush also present. Surface visibility was estimated to be between 76 and 99 percent. Moderate amounts
of aeolian and alluvial erosion, as well as vehicular traffic and military surface debris, were noted. An
estimated 26â50 percent of the site remains intact.

Site Description
2

The site consists of one thermal feature and an associated artifact scatter covering an area of 9,288 m in
eight positive TRUs (Figure 132). The thermal feature is a highly disturbed FCR/burned-caliche

concentration (Figure 133). A trowel test failed to find any datable deposits within this feature. A light
scatter of FCR was present across the surface of the site.

Artifacts
A low-density scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts was documented. The lithic artifacts consisted of
debitage, a retouched flake, and assorted ground stone items. Identified ceramic types included El Paso
Polychrome and El Paso brownware. The presence of El Paso Polychrome ceramics suggests a Late
Formative period occupation.

Site Summary
FB 19415 is a Late Formative period campsite that consists of a single thermal feature and associated lithic
and ceramic artifact scatter. The site exhibits fair integrity and is situated among low coppice dunes within
interdunal blowouts. The single FCR concentration has been highly disturbed by erosion and contains no
datable deposits. In addition, the artifact assemblage contains few items and has low diversity and little
potential for addressing research domains. Therefore, FB 19415 is recommended not eligible for listing in
the NRHP.

261

Isolates
Isolated features and artifacts were identified throughout the project area. A total of 21 isolated features
were recorded across the survey area (see Appendix C), all FCR/burned-caliche concentrations. None of
the FCR features contained ash or datable deposits, and all varied between intact to highly disturbed. The
stains all contained ash and/or datable deposits and also varied from minimally to highly disturbed.
Isolated lithic artifacts recorded throughout the project area consisted of 620 pieces of flaked stone debitage, 78 retouched tools, 76 cores, 242 ground stone items, 16 hammerstones, 1 manuport, and 2,829 pieces
of FCR (see Appendix C). The flaked stone materials were dominated by chert, limestone, and granite.
Fewer ceramics (n = 432) were found. Identified types include El Paso brownware (n = 356), El Paso
Polychrome (n = 53), El Paso Bichrome (n = 1), El Paso Brown (n = 4), El Paso decorated (n = 6), Three
Rivers Red-on-terracotta (n = 2), Playas Red Incised (n = 1), and Chupadero Black-on-white (n = 6). One
textured ware and 2 plain wares were also identified. A detailed list of TRUs that includes isolated artifacts is presented in Appendix D.
Thirty-two artifacts were collected (Appendix E). Collected artifacts consist of 28 projectile points or
projectile-point fragments, 1 quartz crystal, 1 chert microflake, 1 drill, and 1 obsidian nodule. Metric and nonmetric attributes for all the collected points are presented in Appendix G (Tables G.1 and G.2, respectively).

CHAPTER 8

Spatial Patterning
Phillip O. Leckman

Introduction
As discussed in detail in Chapter 3 of this report, the project area is dominated by two primary landforms;
a broad aeolian coppice-dune landscape, characterized by small coppice dunes and sand sheets separated
by blowouts, and a series of large, northânorthwest-trending fault troughs that divide the coppice-dune
landscape into several large, west- and southwest-sloping dune ridges. Although the troughs themselves
represent a fairly small portion of the project areaâdefined depressions associated with the fault troughs
represent only 16.73 acres of the total project acreageâthey appear to exert a major influence on the distribution of sites, features, and artifacts across the region. As seen in Figure 134, documented cultural resources in the project area cluster around these fault troughs, many of which contain playa sediments or
other evidence that they may have seasonally held water. In this chapter, I employ several methods of spatial analysis to characterize the relationship between archaeological materials and fault troughs and to explore the implications of that relationship for understanding prehistoric activity in the Hueco Bolson.
The importance of fault-trough depressions and other playa zones as resources for the regionâs prehistoric residents has long been recognized by archaeologists (see Carmichael and Gerald 1986; Church and
Stowe 2006; Harlan 2002; Leckman et al. 2008; Russell and Arford 2008; Whalen 1977, 1978). In his early
surveys of the Hueco Bolson, Whalen (1977, 1978) quantified associationâdefined as âlocation within
300 m of the playa rimâ (Whalen 1977:17)âfor both Formative period sites and sites of undetermined
date. Within the eastern Hueco Bolson (Whalen 1977:17â19), only Mesilla phase sites occurring below
4,075 m of elevation were statistically associated with playas. However, more sites than expected were
associated with playas within the El Paso phase sample. The projectâs criteria for âassociationâ may have
been too restrictive.
Whalenâs western Hueco Bolson survey (1978), which initially identified many sites revisited by the
present project, included a more detailed expansion of the eastern Hueco Bolson analysis (Whalen 1978:33,
228â229). Although âassociationâ was quantified in the same terms as it was for the previous survey, correlations were examined for a range of distances, beginning with sites within playas and then grouping
sites into 300-m distance intervals from the playa rim. This study documented a significant negative association between sites and areas within playas for both Mesilla and El Paso phase contexts and found a significant positive correlation between Mesilla phase sites and areas located 300â600 m from playa rims. No
other significant positive correlations were noted, but Mesilla phase sites were also somewhat overrepresented within 600â900 m from playa rims, and El Paso sites were overrepresented in the 300â600-m distance zone.
More recently, Church and Stowe (2006) conducted a similar but spatially broader analysis for 287 previously recorded sites scattered across Maneuver Areas 1 and 2, including several sites reinvestigated
by the present project. This analysis was conceptually similar to Whalenâs, at a general level, but considered the locations of sites within 1,000-, 2,000-, and 3,000-m buffers around large swale playas identified
throughout the project area. (The fault-trough playas dominating the present project area were not considered in this analysis). Church and Stowe found higher than average proportions of sites from most time
periods relative to a random sample within the first buffer, somewhat higher proportions of multicomponent

Mesilla/El Paso phase sites within the second buffer, and higher than expected proportions of Archaic
sites within the most distant buffer, at 2,000â3,000 m from swale playas.
The present study examines many of the same themes considered by these earlier investigations but
employs a somewhat different set of methodologies. First, although the distribution of documented sites
relative to playas and other landforms is examined, the primary focus of the analyses that follow is the
distribution of artifact classes and features as manifested in the TRU data collected during the course of
the project. Unlike sites, which must frequently be reduced to a centroid point or another abstract representation in order to be considered in distance tests, density measures, or other spatial analyses, TRU data
preserve the actual spatial locations of cultural materials at a high level of spatial precision. A focus on
TRU data also enables considerably larger sample sizes and, most importantly, allows all archaeological
observations to be considered spatially, rather than excluding nonsite data.
In addition to considering the association between prehistoric cultural materials and playas, the present study also incorporates several independent measures of spatial patterning within the data set, including density mapping and a number of statistical measures of clustering. By putting the relationship between
archaeology and playas in context, in terms of spatial and temporal patterns within the data set as a whole,
the results that follow can hopefully provide additional insights into the importance of playa areas in shaping the land-use practices of the areaâs prehistoric inhabitants.

General Patterns
Viewed at the level of the project area, the general relationship between archaeological manifestations and
fault-trough playas is fairly clear (Figure 135). Sites, features, and positive TRUs are scarce within the interiors of these depressions, here defined by tracing the boundaries of depressions illustrated on 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps. However, archaeological materials hug the crests
of the fault scarps, particularly along the large dune ridge that runs northwestâsoutheast through the center of the project area. Many of the largest sites documented during the survey lie along this ridge, with
associated cultural materials trailing down the ridgeâs relatively gentle, western slope. At the base of the
dune ridge, a second group of smaller sites clusters around the eastern margin of the project areaâs largest
and deepest fault trough. Beyond the central ridge, smaller but equally dense clusters of TRUs and features
occur on smaller, lower ridges at the northeastern and southwestern edges of the project area.
The survey parcel is fairly compact, and this, combined with the number and sizes of local fault troughs,
means that most of the project area is in reasonably close proximity to a playa. If the 1-km concentric buffers employed by Church and Stowe are applied to the present project area, for instance, more than 90 percent of the area surveyed falls within the first catchment. Only small zones at the far northeast and southeast edges of the project area are located more than 1 km from a fault-trough depression.

Goodness-of-Fit
In order to evaluate the relationship between documented cultural materials and fault troughs, I expanded
on the tests of association employed by Whalen by adapting the goodness-of-fit methodology recently
used to examine spatial patterning on several large surveys conducted on the northern McGregor Range
(see Harlan and Ennes 1999; Kludt 2007, 2008; Leckman, Doleman, et al. 2009; Leckman, Vierra, and
Murrell 2009a, 2009b). As articulated by Kludt (2007, 2008), his analysis essentially had two parts. First,
he performed a contingency-table analysis for his artifact-data categories as a whole, to evaluate the null
265

Figure 135. Topography of the project area, with
fault troughs and major classes of cultural material.

266

hypothesis that no association existed between the archaeological assemblage and the distribution of geomorphic mapping units within the project area (Kludt 2008:178). Second, he performed a goodness-of-fit
test for each individual artifact category, comparing the observed proportion of artifacts within particular
geomorphic units against expected proportions, based on the ratio of those units within the project area, and
quantifying the deviation from expected values for each category. Chi-square statistics were calculated for
each category in order to evaluate the null hypothesis that the distribution of artifacts by geomorphic unit
would be proportional to the distribution of units within the project area (Kludt 2008:178). It is worthwhile,
however, to note the large number of cases considered here when interpreting these results, because chisquare values are highly sensitive to large n values (Harlan and Ennes 1999:70).
The present analysis follows Kludtâs methods, but rather than considering geomorphic units, it examines the distribution of artifacts relative to the arbitrary 300-m distance catchments employed by Whalen
(Whalen 1978:228â229). Five distance catchments are considered: areas within the fault-trough basins,
areas located within 300 m of a playa rim, areas within 300â600 m of a rim, areas within 600â900 m, and
areas located more than 900 m from a playa rim. Compared to Kludtâs analysis, the present study also expands the artifact categories considered and evaluates the distribution of all TRUs containing prehistoric
artifacts, as well as individual artifact classes. This allows the distribution of locations where archaeology
is present to be considered independently from examinations of the magnitude or distribution of particular
artifact classes. Before considering TRU-level goodness-of-fit results, however, we begin with an examination of the relationship between site frequency, area, and location relative to playas for the 99 sites identified or revisited during the present survey.
As Table 252 illustrates, sites are generally somewhat overrepresented close to fault troughs and somewhat underrepresented at further distances. For the most part, however, the deviation from expected patterns is fairly slight, on the order of 5 percent or less. However, there are two exceptions to this pattern.
Sites located within 300â600 m of a playa margin are dramatically overrepresented by more than 10 percent, and far fewer sites than expected are located within the fault troughs themselves. Sites in the 300â
600-m zone are also much larger on average than sites elsewhere, and sites located within playas have the
second-smallest mean area overall. Interestingly, sites occur at distances of more than 600 m from playa
zones at almost precisely the frequency expected, based on site area (Figure 136). Sites located at these
greater distances, however, are somewhat disparate in terms of their average areas. Sites in the most distant zone, much smaller on average than sites in the 300â600-m zone, are also fairly large relative to other
zones, with the second-largest average area among the zones. The smallest sites are located in the 600â
900-m zone, which also contains approximately the number of sites expected.
Statistics for all positive TRUs are presented in Table 253. Once again, the 300â600-m zone contains
the most archaeology and exhibits the greatest positive deviation from expected results. Unlike the data
for sites, however, TRUs are also somewhat overrepresented in the 0â300-m and the 600â900-m zones.
Beyond this distance, TRUs are slightly underrepresented. Like the site distribution, the greatest negative
deviation from expected results occurs within the playas themselves, where TRUs are greatly underrepresented. Although the relative frequency of artifacts within each TRU is not considered here, TRU locations appear to share the same bias toward the 300â600-m zone that is present within the site data.

Prehistoric Artifacts
If specific artifact and feature types and frequencies are considered, very different patterns and biases
emerge, and clear distributional differences are seen among different artifact categories. Taken as a whole,
contingency-table results indicate that both lithics (Table 254) and ceramics (Table 255) vary significantly
with distance from the fault troughs; the relationship between artifact frequency and the distance categories is significantly patterned across all data classes, except those, like Chupadero Black-on-white, with
very small sample sizes for the project area. Considered as a single class (Table 256), ceramics are fairly

uncommon, occurring in only about one-fifth of the positive TRU cells documented during the survey. As
a whole, ceramics are moderately overrepresented at distances between 300 and 900 m from fault troughs.
However, unlike TRU locations, ceramics are somewhat underrepresented at nearer distances to fault
troughs. Interestingly, ceramics are also significantly overrepresented at distances beyond 900 m from
fault troughs. Indeed, this distance zone contains more ceramics than any other but the 600â900-m zone,
even though the zone beyond 900 m represents the smallest portion of the survey area. Although total ceramic counts are higher than expected in the 300â900-m range, their abundance at greater distances belies
the overall tendency among both sites and TRUs to occur in close proximity to fault troughs.
The ceramic assemblage documented during the project is overwhelmingly dominated by locally produced wares, with El Paso brownware and decorated types representing nearly 97 percent of the total; so,
it is not surprising that the distribution of the local-wares pattern is almost identical to the overall distribution (Table 257). However, the tiny assemblage of nonlocal wares (n = 76) also exhibits the same pattern
(Table 258), with some degree of overrepresentation at distances greater than 300 m from fault troughs
and the most-pronounced overrepresentation at distances greater than 900 m. Indeed, nonlocal wares occur at almost double the expected frequency at the latter distance.
If individual wares are examined, brown (both El Paso Brown and undifferentiated brown) wares represent almost 85 percent of the total assemblage and thus also share the pattern already presented (Table 259).
The sizeable El Paso Polychrome assemblage, however, has a somewhat different distribution (Table 260).
El Paso Polychrome sherds are also overrepresented at greater distances from playas and less common in
proximity to them. Indeed, El Paso Polychromes are underrepresented within 300 m of playas to a much
greater degree than any other ceramic grouping considered, and unlike brown wares, total local or nonlocal wares, or the assemblage as a whole, they are also underrepresented at distances between 300 and
600 m from playas. However, unlike other categories examined, El Paso Polychrome sherds are dramatically overrepresented in the 600â900-m zone and only moderately overrepresented at greater distances;
sherds located between 600 and 900 m of a playa represent more than 44 percent of the total El Paso
Polychrome assemblage, a far-greater proportion of the total than for other wares or groupings. Given El
Paso Polychromeâs significance as a diagnostic Late Formative ware, the wareâs slightly different distribution is intriguing. As a whole, ceramic distributions appear to suggest that Formative period activities
in the project area that involved the heavy use of ceramics, such as habitation, agriculture, or plant processing, were focused in areas at least 300 m from playa margins, and especially at distances beyond 900 m.
However, the El Paso Polychrome pattern may suggest that Late Formative habitation was more constrained than in earlier periods and particularly focused in areas between 600 and 900 m from playa margins. This possibility will be examined in more detail in the section that follows.
First, however, I examine the distribution of several classes of lithic artifacts. Compared to the fairly
homogenous pattern exhibited by the ceramic wares discussed above, the lithic categories considered are
more diverse, exhibiting distributional patterns that differ strongly from other lithic categories and from
the pattern exhibited by the ceramic wares considered. Lithic debitage (Table 261) is overrepresented in
all locations, except within the playas themselves, where it is dramatically underrepresented. However,
the degree of overrepresentation is relatively moderate at all distances but the 600â900-m zone, which
contains more than 45 percent of the total assemblage. Lithic tools (Table 262) are similarly overrepresented in the 600â900-m zone, which represents nearly 55 percent of the total, but are also moderately underrepresented at both greater distances and at distances within 300 m of a playa margin. By contrast, lithic
cores (Table 263) are strongly overrepresented in the immediate playa-margin zone (0â300 m) and occur
at descending frequencies at larger distance intervals, with moderate overrepresentation at 300â600 m, essentially the expected frequency of artifacts at 600â900 m, and underrepresentation beyond that distance.
Ground stone (Table 264) is also apparently more common nearer to playas, with moderate overrepresentation at all distances between 0 and 900 m from playa margins and underrepresentation beyond that.
Although there are considerable differences between individual lithic-artifact categories, lithics as a
whole exhibit a very different distributional pattern from that of ceramics, generally occurring much
nearer to the playas. All lithic classes but debitage are underrepresented at distances beyond 900 m, a
sharp contrast to ceramic distributions. Some overlap exists, however; like El Paso Polychrome, cores and

tools are most common between 600 and 900 m from playas. Except for several uncommon ceramic wares
with very small sample sizes, all classes of both lithic and ceramic artifacts are also overrepresented
between 300 and 600 m from playa margins.

Prehistoric Features
Some 541 prehistoric features were documented by the present survey, nearly 75 percent of which were
surface cultural stains. Almost all other documented prehistoric features were FCR concentrations. Feature locations appear to correlate strongly with the immediate margins of fault-trough playas (Table 265);
they are strongly overrepresented in both the 0â300-m and 300â600-m distance zones. Together, these
two zones account for nearly 70 percent of documented prehistoric features and represent less than 50 percent of the project area. The 404 documented surface stains (Table 266) are even more closely associated
with playa margins, with overrepresentation in the 0â300-m zone of more than 14 percent. Stains are overrepresented both in this zone and at distances of 300â600 m, with nearly 73 percent of all documented
stains located within 600 m of a playa. By contrast, the 133 recorded FCR concentrations (Table 267)
tended to be located somewhat further from playas, with overrepresentation present in the 600â900-m
zone, as well as the two nearer zones. However, the degree of overrepresentation is only pronounced in the
300â600-m zone, which contains approximately one-third of the total documented concentrations.
As a whole, then, prehistoric features are more strongly associated with playas than the artifact categories considered above. For both stains and FCR concentrations, more than half of the documented feature assemblage is located within 600 m of a playa. In this sense, feature distributions appear to resemble
the distributions of lithic cores and ground stone, which also predominate in these two zones. Feature distributions are fairly homogenous, however, with the same general pattern present for both stains and FCR
concentrations.

Estimated Density
Although the goodness-of-fit results identified and discussed in the preceding section allow site, artifact,
and feature distributions relative to fault-trough playas to be addressed at the level of the project area as a
whole, these patterns can be explored and examined in more detail by mapping the distributions across
the landscape of the artifact categories explored above. Several methods exist for modeling and illustrating the intensity and range of point distributions like the TRU data set, including trend-surface methods,
such as inverse distance weighting (Conolly and Lake 2006:94â96; Kludt 2008:183; OâSullivan and Unwin 2003:227â232), and more-complex interpolation methods, such as kriging (Conolly and Lake 2006:97â
100; OâSullivan and Unwin 2003:265â280). In this chapter, however, we employ a somewhat simpler
method, kernel-density estimation (KDE). This nonparametric technique places a two-dimensional probability distance function, or âkernel,â around each data point (Conolly and Lake 2006:175â177). The shape
and radius of the kernel can be manipulated in order to create a smooth, readily interpretable approximation of the dataâs distribution. Although not as statistically robust as some of the other methods, the kernel
method is well suited for the kind of general pattern analysis desired here. For the present analysis, a 250m kernel was employed around each point, and artifact densities were estimated in terms of artifact counts
per square kilometer. Estimated density values were symbolized using a five-class natural-breaks classification designed to place class boundaries at actual peaks or valleys present within the data. For all artifact
and feature categories, areas with estimated densities of zero for cultural materials in that category were
omitted from the classification and appear as blank space on the maps that follow.
If density is estimated for all documented prehistoric artifacts (Figure 137), the results closely mirror
the subjective observations about the distribution of cultural materials made above. High-density areas run

along the project areaâs dune ridges, particularly along the scarp of the large central ridge, with smaller
but seemingly more-clustered high-density areas along the smaller eastern and western ridges. Artifact
densities on the central ridgeâs western slope are, for the most part, much lower, and the small sites along
the playa margin at the base of this slope are comparatively low, as well. A low-density scatter of artifacts
is present across virtually the entire project area, but sizeable areas with an estimated density of zero are
present within several of the fault-trough playas and at the extreme southern and northern edges of the survey
parcel. Interestingly, these latter areas partially correspond to zones at the greatest distances from a playa.

Ceramics
The estimated distribution of ceramic artifacts (Figure 138) displays a very different pattern. Although ceramics are present in at least minimal densities across most of the project area, their distribution across the
central dune ridge is extremely light, with higher densities limited to a handful of spatially restricted areas
representing single sites or portions of sites. Isolated high-density locations on the central ridge include
FB 6273, FB 6837, FB 7916, and FB 19388, as well as portions of FB 6774 and 6839. Interestingly, FB 6774
is the only one of these sites located along the scarp of the ridge, and four of the six sites (FB 6837, FB 6839,
FB 7916, and FB 19388) are located near the ridgeâs base. Areas of high ceramic density are also spatially
restricted on the small northeastern ridge, where they are limited to a pair of isolated areas within FB 7721.
By contrast, the southwestern ridge is characterized by numerous fairly extensive areas of high ceramic
density that together form a high-density cluster encapsulating most of the sites in this vicinity. Interestingly, ceramics are also present in comparatively high densities at FB 6832, the only large site documented within a fault-trough playa.
The density data also provide support for the temporal pattern suggested by goodness-of-fit results,
indicating a possibly more restricted distribution for Late Formative El Paso Polychrome compared to
early El Paso brownware. If estimated densities are compared for temporally early wares (El Paso brownware and Mimbres Black-on-white) and later wares (El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-white,
Chihuahuan wares, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, and Lincoln Black-on-red), the distribution of the earlier wares (Figure 139) is unsurprisingly a close match for the estimated density patterns displayed by the
ceramic assemblage as a whole. By contrast, high-density areas for late wares (Figure 140) are noticeably
more restricted. Late ceramics are absent from several of the sites mentioned above, especially at the
southern edge of the project area, although high-density areas are still limited to sites within this group.
Again, the southwestern ridge represents the largest contiguous cluster of high-density areas. Compared
to either the distribution of early ceramics or the ceramic assemblage as a whole, late wares are also absent from a sizeable portion of the project area, with large swaths of the survey parcel reporting densities
of zero.

Lithics
Lithic artifacts, by contrast (Figure 141), have a much wider distribution of high-density areas than any of
the ceramic categories considered, with at least low densities present across nearly the entire project area,
including most of the area of the fault-trough playas. Higher densities are essentially present wherever
there are sites, although data along the central dune ridge indicate the presence of three high-density clusters, each of which consists of multiple large sites. Lithic densities are also high on the small northeastern
ridge but are comparatively lower on the southwestern ridge, although moderately high artifact densities
are estimated for FB 6773. In sum, then, lithics are much more ubiquitous than ceramics, occurring in
high densities across a much wider portion of the project area. Maximum estimated densities are also
higher for lithics than for ceramics, especially on the central ridge, where areas of high ceramic density
occur only sporadically.

Figure 142 illustrates the estimated density of lithic artifacts occurring in cells containing no ceramics.
This distribution should not be interpreted in a strictly temporal sense; the absence of ceramics from a
particular cell or area may result from formational or behavioral processes as well as temporal ones. Further, none of the lithic-artifact classes present in sufficient quantities for density to be estimated have direct temporal relevance. However, when considered in the aggregate, areas with high estimated density in
this figure presumably represent locations that were repeatedly utilized for particular suites of activities.
Where these high-density, lithics-only areas do not correspond with concentrations of ceramic artifacts,
the activities represented were likely ones in which the use of ceramic vessels played little or no significant role. These might have been associated with hunting or other forms of resource procurement and presumably include traces of activities that occurred over the entire prehistory of the region, including earlier
periods as well as the Formative period.
In most respects, the distribution of these lithics-only cells is similar to the distribution of all lithic
cells. Densities are highest along and just below the scarp of the central ridge, forming a more or less continuous band of high-density areas along this feature. A high-density area is also present on the northeastern ridge, running through FB 6816 and, to a lesser degree, in FB 7721. Elsewhere, areas of moderately
high density are present on the southwestern ridge, particularly at FB 6773, and within the sites at the
base of the central ridge. In contrast to the sporadic distribution of ceramic artifacts, lithics-only cells appear to occur across nearly all of the project area, with only small zero-density areas present. Like the estimated density of all lithic artifacts, the lithics-only distribution includes numerous high-density areas
where ceramic artifacts are absent or appear in only low densities, especially during Late Formative times.
As suggested above, these areas, which include large swathes of the central ridge, probably represent zones
of repeated activity in which ceramics played only a minor role. Although moderately high lithics-only
densities are also present on the southwestern ridge, as mentioned above, these have a different spatial
distribution than high ceramic densities, with peak densities in the area focused on the southern two-thirds
of FB 6773.

Features
Like lithic artifacts, areas with high prehistoric-feature densities occur most extensively along the central
ridge, with smaller high-density areas present on the northeastern and southwestern ridges (Figure 143).
However, feature densities on the northeastern ridge (mostly within FB 7721) are as high or higher than
the highest-density areas on the central ridge. Together with high-density areas located in the northern and
eastern portions of FB 6774 and a smaller zone of high feature density within FB 6776, the northeastern
ridge zone is part of a group of high-density zones concentrated around a gap between two fault-trough
playas at the northeastern corner of the project area. Although gaps exist between individual areas with
high feature densities, the group as a whole forms a fairly tight cluster; five of the seven areas with the
highest estimated feature density are found here, within a 1-km radius of each other. Of the two remaining
areas with the highest density, one, at FB 6273, is also located on the central ridge, in close proximity to
the large high-density cluster, and the other is located on the southwestern ridge, in the southern part of
FB 6773.
As mentioned above, nearly three-quarters of the prehistoric features identified during the project were
cultural stains; so, it is unsurprising that estimated stain density (Figure 144) closely mirrors the overall feature pattern. There are several interesting differences between the two distributions, however. Once again,
areas with the highest estimated density are concentrated within an approximately 1-km radius around the gap
between the two northeastern fault troughs. Fewer highest-density zones exist beyond this area, however;
the high-density pocket present at FB 6273 for all features is absent for stains, and although the southwestern high-density area at FB 6773 is still present, it is somewhat smaller in size. Stains therefore appear to be
even more concentrated in the northeastern high-density zone than are the feature assemblage as a whole.

288

The differences in estimated density between all features and cultural stains suggest that FCR concentrations must have a somewhat different distribution, and indeed, this appears to be the case (Figure 145).
Although the highest-density class for these features includes two areas within the northeastern feature
cluster (in the southern third of FB 7721 and the northwestern portion of FB 6774), the largest high-density areas are located elsewhere along the central ridge, within FB 6273 and FB 6754. Although the
northeastern cluster continues to exhibit high feature densities, then, FCR features are not as uniquely
concentrated here as cultural stains were. Interestingly, although there is a zone of moderately high feature density within FB 6773, no areas on the southwestern ridge fall within the highest density class.

Patterns of Clustering
The two previous analyses have examined various aspects of the distributions of lithics, ceramics, and
prehistoric features and identified a distinct distributional pattern for each class. The different distributional patterns displayed by these three general classes of material culture can be assessed quantitatively
through a number of statistical methods for identifying patterns of spatial clustering and describing their
intensity. Two methods of point-pattern analysis were employed here: the nearest-neighbor statistic (R)
and the multiscalar clustering statistic known as Ripleyâs K. The R statistic is a commonly used, if somewhat problematic, basic statistic for identifying and quantifying the presence of clustering within a data
set, calculated by dividing the mean of the observed distance between each point and its nearest neighbor
by the estimated mean distance between points if the point distribution were random (Conolly and Lake
2006:165). The resulting ratio indicates a spatially dispersed pattern if it is greater than 1.00 and a clustered pattern if it is less than 1.00. A z value can then be calculated to assess the significance of this pattern. Generally, z scores above 1.96 indicate statistically significant patterns of dispersion, whereas scores
below â1.96 indicate significant clustering. R statistics for the material-culture classes considered above
are presented in Table 268. At the data-set level, each class exhibits statistically significant clustering.
Taken as a whole, late ceramics and FCR concentrations are less clustered than other data sets, perhaps
because of the number of isolated instances present within each class. In general, though, the R statistic is
not particularly informative here, other than to provide quantitative support for the perceived clusters
identified through density analysis.
Whereas the R statistic characterizes clustering at the level of the entire data set being considered, the
second statistical method employed here, Ripleyâs K statistic, provides a multiscalar delineation of clustering patterns. Designed to identify patterns of clustering or dispersion at different spatial scales, Ripleyâs K calculates the expected average number of neighbors for an arbitrary point within the point pattern
at successively larger regular intervals of a particular radius. In the primary analysis of structure clustering
in the central site area, for instance, 100 intervals were considered, beginning at the arbitrary point and increasing in 20-m increments. Because this distance interval is fairly small, there may well be clustering patterns that extend beyond the analysisâs maximum reach of 2 km. However, using a smaller interval also
means that confidence intervals for significance can be generated using multiple Monte Carlo simulations
of a random point pattern with the same number of values as the data set (Connolly and Lake 2006:166).
In the present analysis, 999 iterations were used to generate these confidence envelopes. Finally, these expected values of K are compared against observed values, to identify both the intensity of the clusters present in the data set and the distances at which these clusters exist. K functions for a particular data set can
then be illustrated using Ripleyâs L, a common transformation of K that plots spatially random patterns
(L = 0) as a horizontal line. Values above this line indicate clustering at a particular distance, whereas values below the line indicate dispersion.
Ripleyâs K results for the same material classes reveal several interesting patterns that align well with
the subjective observations made earlier on the basis of density patterns. Ceramic artifacts (Figure 146)
only exhibit statistically significant clustering to a distance of about 500 m but continue to display some

degree of clustering out to distances of approximately 1.8 km. Ceramic clustering displays two general
peaks, at about 400 m and again at about 900 m. These patterns likely reflect the distributions observed
during the density analysis; ceramics are highly clustered at relatively short distances, and some level of
clustering is present among multiple small, high-intensity clusters, but the small size of these clusters
means that significance drops off swiftly, even when some clustering remains. Importantly, the maximum
distance at which clustering is present for ceramics, 1.8 km, is approximately the maximum dimension of
the zone of relatively high ceramic densities present on the southwestern ridge. The data for early (Figure 147) and late (Figure 148) ceramic wares display very similar clustering patterns, but significant
clustering ends at closer distances in both cases, at about 220 m. This pattern is interesting; despite the
greater ubiquity and broader distribution of late wares, their locations relative to each other are very similar
to ceramics from earlier periods. In general, all ceramics groupings examined exhibit clustering to some
degree at all distances, from 0 m to a maximum of about 1.8 km.
Lithic artifacts (Figure 149), by contrast, exhibit a very different pattern. Lithics exhibit a lower degree of clustering than ceramics do, with a maximum Ripleyâs K value of only about 120 at a distance of
140 m. Clustering within the lithics assemblage is also only present at fairly close distances, out to about
880 m. The clustering displayed by lithic artifacts in cells that do not also contain ceramics (Figure 150)
is very similar. These results are consistent with the observations made based on the density maps, which
suggest that lithics are, in general, less clustered than ceramics but occur in some spatial association with
each other across a wide area. Both the less-intensive degree of clustering and the rapid drop-off from
clustering into dispersion mirror these results; unlike ceramics, which primarily occur in a large group of
high-intensity clusters on the southwestern ridge, smaller groups of high-density lithic clusters are widely
dispersed along the projectâs dune ridges. However, the clustering present is significant at all distances
where any clustering is present, probably reflecting the presence of loose, relatively low-intensity but spatially extensive clusters within the widely distributed lithic data set. The results also likely reflect the
greater number of lithic artifacts present and perhaps also the broader spatial distribution of lithics within
the project area.
Finally, results for prehistoric features (Figure 151) display characteristics of both ceramics and lithics; clustering is present out to a considerable distance, like the ceramics data set, but like the lithics data,
this clustering is both highly significant and of only moderate overall intensity, peaking at a value of less
than 300. Again, these results probably reflect the broad spatial distribution of features and, as for ceramics, indicate the existence of some degree of clustering joining multiple smaller clusters. Unlike ceramics,
however, this broader-scale clustering achieves statistical significance. In this regard, it is important to observe that the maximum distance at which clustering occurs in the feature data set, about 1.8 km, coincides with the approximate diameter of the northeastern high-density feature cluster discussed in the preceding section.

Discussion
With the addition of the clustering data, we can now describe the distributions of the three material-culture classes considered in some detail. Prehistoric ceramics appear to be tightly clustered on the southwestern ridge, with only small, isolated high-density areas present elsewhere. Areas with high ceramic
densities are also located at somewhat greater distances from the adjacent fault-trough playas than other
material classes. Within this pattern, Late Formative ceramic wares, such as El Paso Polychrome, have an
even more restricted spatial distribution but are typically located somewhat nearer to playas than the assemblages as a whole. The small size and high intensity of these high-density ceramic areas mean that they
only exhibit statistically significant clustering at very small distances. However, the concentration of so

much of the ceramic assemblage on the small southwestern ridge means that the ceramic assemblage displays some degree of clustering out to a distance of 1.8 km. The spatially restricted distribution of ceramics suggests that Formative period activities in which ceramics were employed were likewise spatially restricted. In this regard, it may be significant that the fault-trough playa adjacent to the ridge where most
ceramics occur is apparently the deepest in the project area (see Figure 135). As such, it would be an attractive resource for both farming and habitation. Later Formative wares are more spatially restricted than
earlier wares, suggesting the continued intensification of this pattern over time.
Compared to ceramics, lithic artifacts have a much broader and more diffuse spatial distribution, with
areas of high density located across the project area, but especially along the scarp of the large central
ridge. Many high-density lithic areas do not appear to contain ceramic artifacts in significant frequencies.
In general, lithic artifacts are located in closer proximity to playas than ceramics are, although there is considerable overlap between the two artifact classes at moderate distances from playas. High-density lithic
clusters do not appear to display the intensity of clustering present within the ceramic data, and clustering
disappears altogether at a distance of less than half that at which ceramic clustering disappears, but the degree of clustering present is statistically significant for this entire range. The less-intensive but more-significant clustering displayed by lithics relative to ceramics suggests that the primary prehistoric use of
much of the project area was likewise less spatially restricted and wider ranging, probably indicating the
repeated logistical use of the areas around playas. Activities associated with this repeated use do not appear to have involved ceramics in any quantity and thus may include traces of Archaic period or earlier
land use. However, these areas were almost certainly utilized for similar purposes in Formative times, as
well. The association between high lithic densities and the scarp of the central ridge may be significant
for interpreting these activities, as the vantage point the scarp provided across the adjacent playas and
nearby smaller ridges would likely have made this area a desirable location for hunting camps and other
activities associated with game procurement.

295

Finally, prehistoric features are located across the project area but are especially clustered within a 2km-diameter area at the northeastern corner of the project area. Both FCR concentrations and stains are
concentrated in this area, although high-density areas for the concentrations are distributed somewhat
more diffusely. Features are located in closer proximity to fault-trough playas than the artifact classes
consideredâthe high-density cluster just mentioned is located on the immediate margins of a pair of
playasâbut again, the zones in which they are overrepresented overlap with the other material classes.
Like ceramics, features display clustering across a broad distance, out as far as 1.8 km. However, this
clustering is statistically significant across this entire range. The wide range of this clustering probably
corresponds directly to the group of high-density areas discussed above, which, as mentioned, has similar
maximum dimensions. Given the predominance of stains among reported features, it is possible that the
high-density area may be, at least in part, the result of more-pronounced erosional processes. However,
the dramatically higher occurrence of features in this area must be assumed to have behavioral significance, as well. This area was clearly the focus of a great deal of activity and, probably, resource processing. Given the lack of correspondence with ceramic distributions, it might be a good location in which to
look for evidence of Archaic period occupations.

Research Questions
Bradley J. Vierra, Phillip O. Leckman, and Jason Windingstad

Introduction
The survey project is situated in the Hueco Bolson, in an area characterized by mesquite-covered coppice
dunes with interdunal blowouts. A total of 99 sites were recorded, including occupations dating from the
Paleoindian to the Late Formative period. Many of the sites consist of isolated FCR features with a few
artifacts; however, large palimpsests appear to reflect the intense reuse of certain locales. Otherwise, the
archaeological record represents varying degrees of artifact and feature densities with respect to specific
topographic settings and therefore provides a wealth of information to address the research questions, as
presented in Chapter 5.
The current significance standards require that a site contain attributes that include integrity, chronological-dating potential, and associated artifacts (Miller, Kenmotsu, et al. 2009). However, the data potential of a site to address the various research domains and contexts is also important for evaluating the siteâs
eligibility for listing in the NRHP. The following research questions address the research domains as originally defined in the previous significance standards (Abbott et al. 1996) and the original POW (Vierra
et al. 2008).

Chronometrics and Geomorphology
At a basic level, the research potential of archaeological materials encountered during the survey process
is derived from two factors: their temporal placement and their geomorphological integrity. It is therefore
critical that evaluations (1) examine whether a particular site has the potential to be accurately dated, (2) obtain at least a basic idea of the siteâs specific geomorphological associations, and (3) determine whether
cultural deposits at the site retain structural integrity.
Indicators of a siteâs potential for absolute or relative dating include the presence or absence of charcoal, organic stains, or other materials that could potentially be subjected to AMS radiocarbon dating, as
well as the presence or absence of temporally diagnostic projectile points, ceramic types, or other artifacts
that could provide a relative date. Assessments of site geomorphology should begin with the characterization of the specific geomorphic contexts within which surface cultural material is encountered.
Once the overall geomorphic context of a site has been identified, the integrity of site deposits should
be evaluated. The probable presence or absence of subsurface cultural deposits should be evaluated, indicators of whether site structure is intact or compromised should be noted, and major sources of natural or
human-caused disturbance should be noted and evaluated. Prior geomorphological work at Fort Bliss provides a rich context for interpreting the sedimentary sequences and the aeolian and alluvial processes at
work within the present project area (Abbott et al. 1996; Johnson 1997; Monger 1993). This research issue addresses the chronometrics and geomorphology research domains.

297

Research Questions
1. To what extent can chronological determinations be made for each site?
2. Are intrasite chronological variation and patterning present, and if so, what are the implications?
3. How do the chronological determinations of the project sites compare to those of other relevant sites
in the area?
4. What is the geomorphic context of the cultural deposits and surrounding sediments for the sites?
5. Are the cultural deposits in a primary or a secondary context, and what are the implications of these
associations?
Ninety-nine sites were recorded during the SRI survey, with only relative dates obtained from most of
these sites. The full prehistoric sequence from the Paleoindian through the Late Formative period was
identified during the survey. In addition, limited evidence for the historical-period use of the area was
also documented. Paleoindian period use of the area was identified at FB 8083, where a Midland point was
collected (Church and Stowe 2006). Evidence for the Archaic period use increases, with eight EarlyâLate
Archaic period site components identified: Early Archaic period (n = 1), Middle Archaic period (n = 3),
and Late Archaic period (n = 4). In contrast, 67 sites contained Formative period components. The intensity
in land use appears to increase through time, as reflected in the surface ceramic assemblages: undetermined
Formative (n = 35), EarlyâMiddle Formative (n = 9), and Late Formative (n = 23) period sites. Lastly,
40 sites were simply identified as undetermined prehistoric.
Mauldinâs (1996; see Mauldin et al. 1998) review of radiocarbon dates in the Hueco Bolson also identified a relatively long-term increase in the use of the basin, from the Archaic through the Early Formative
period until after 1350 B.P., when the number of dated thermal features markedly declined. On the other
hand, obsidian-hydration dates indicate the limited use of the area by later Formative period groups.
Mauldin suggested that this represents a shift from residential to logistical use of the basin. As previously
noted, the SRI and Lone Mountain survey data indicate a relative increase in the use of these areas from
the Late Archaic through the Late Formative period. As Miller and Kenmotsu (2004) pointed out, there is
a marked decline in the presence of residential structures within the basin by about A.D. 1000 that presumably reflects a shift from residentially to logistically focused land use.
Several previous testing and excavation projects that yielded radiocarbon dates have been conducted
in the vicinity of the project. All but one of these dates can be attributed to Late Archaic and Early Formative period occupations. Only a single date represented a Late Formative period occupation (Church and
Stowe 2006; Church et al. 2007; Condon et al. 2007; Renn et al. 2008). In contrast, surface indications appear to reflect a predominance of Late Formative period and undetermined Formative period sites. The
latter sites and the larger palimpsests may include these earlier Formative period occupations.
On the other hand, excavations were conducted at seven sites situated at the western end of Training
Area 1B (Kenmotsu et al. 2008). Prior to excavation, six sites were described as potentially representing
Late Formative period logistical sites, with the remaining one containing Late Formative period surface
rooms. After the fieldwork was completed, it was determined that three of these were small campsites,
each containing several thermal features dating from the Late Archaic to the Late Formative period; a
single Late Formative period site contained a midden and/or structure. In contrast, three sites contained
evidence of numerous buried features and structures (e.g., pit rooms and a six-room pueblo). Excavations
were halted once the complexity of these sites was determined; nonetheless, the preliminary evidence indicates EarlyâLate Formative period occupations. Obviously, the surface-artifact and feature distributions
only provided limited evidence of the actual complexity and temporal sequence represented at these sites,
which were situated in dune settings.
The spatial analyses discussed in Chapter 8 of this report provide some support for the notion that
large palimpsest sites include Formative period as well as earlier components, as indicated by the surface
distribution of ceramic artifacts. However, the distribution of Formative period artifacts within the palimpsest sites was generally spatially limited compared to the distribution of lithics, with most areas with high
298

ceramic density concentrated on a single ridge at the southwestern edge of the project area. Ceramic distributions on the large central ridge, where the largest palimpsest sites were found, were generally somewhat isolated and spatially restricted, forming small areas with indications of heavy ceramic use within
much larger distributions of high-density lithics. High-density areas on the large central ridge included
evidence for Late as well as Early Formative period use, although the distribution of Late Formative period ceramic wares appeared to be even more spatially restricted than the distribution of early wares.
As the small number of sites with attested Archaic period or earlier components indicates, zones with
high lithic densities likely represent traces of Formative period as well as earlier activities, and ceramics
appear in low densities at many of them. The limited distribution of high-density ceramic zones, however,
indicates that Formative period activities in which ceramics played a significant role occurred in a spatially
restricted set of locations, relative to the more-widespread evidence for lithic use.
Geomorphic reconnaissance in the current survey area revealed two major landform types, the coppice-dune deflationary area and the linear fault-scarpâtrough landform. Fault-trough fill appears to consist
dominantly of Q2 (9400â15,000 B.P.) through Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) playa and/or alluvial sedimentary facies deposits. Sites located near fault scarps are associated with Q3 (100â7300 B.P.) alluvial sediments
overlain by Q4 (<100 B.P.) aeolian sands. Q3âQ4 aeolian and alluvial sediments dominate in the coppicedune deflationary areas away from fault complexes.
A more complete stratigraphic record has been preserved in most of the fault troughs across the survey area. Although local disturbance has undoubtedly occurred through pedogenic processes (biomantle
mixing), stratigraphic integrity is still considered to be high, and these areas have a greater potential to
contain intact cultural materials. Most of the Q3 alluvial and/or aeolian sediments preserved below coppice dunes adjacent to fault scarps appear to have been truncated (as indicated by a lack of buried A horizons in Q3 sediments), resulting in a loss of some stratigraphic integrity in these areas. Additionally, local
gradients related to basin-floor deformation have resulted in channelized overland flow connecting blowouts. This has undoubtedly redistributed artifacts laterally in some areas. Within the coppice-dune deflationary areas away from faults, stratigraphic integrity in blowouts is considered to be lost. Intact Q3 alluvial and aeolian sediments were encountered below sand sheets and coppice dunes, away from the
fault complexes; however, surface horizons were typically truncated, indicating erosion prior to burial.
Overall, the areas with the highest potential to contain intact cultural deposits (areas with the highest stratigraphic integrity) were located in fault troughs. Increased slope gradients along fault scarps resulted in
an increase in erosion and a loss of some stratigraphic integrity.

Land Use and Landscape in the Southern Maneuver Areas
The project is located in the Southern Maneuver Areas of Fort Bliss. The majority of the sites in the project area are small, nondiagnostic or aceramic lithic scatters that cannot be attributed to any specific time
period. They are dispersed across the basin in the same fashion as Archaic period and Mesilla phase sites,
measure less than 0.25 ha in size, lack diagnostic artifacts, and contain one or two hearths (Mauldin
1994:189). Whalenâs (1980, 1981, 1986) preliminary study of these sites revealed that many could be radiocarbon dated to the Archaic period or the Mesilla phase of the Formative period but not to the El Paso
phase. Therefore, Archaic period and Mesilla phase camps may be numerous in the basin, and only a few
of the sites appear to represent El Paso phase limited-activity sites. Studies of âsmall sitesâ by Mauldin
(1994, 1996) and Mauldin et al. (1998) used both radiocarbon and obsidian-hydration dating to temporally
assign these sites. The results of the radiocarbon-dating portion of these studies were similar to Whalenâsâ
that is, most of the sites dated to the Late Archaic period and Mesilla phase, and practically none dated to
the El Paso phase. Organizational changes apparently occurred with respect to the way the prehistoric inhabitants of the area used the basin. For example, the presence of hearths at small sites during the Archaic
period and Mesilla phase indicates the dispersed residential use of the basin. In contrast, the absence of
299

hearths, along with the presence of datable obsidian artifacts, indicates that El Paso phase populations may
have been using the basin in a logistical fashion, with task groups exploiting wild resources and returning
to their nearby villages. This research issue addresses the land use and subsistence research domains.

Research Questions
1. How do potential activities associated with a site relate to subsistence resources or raw materials possibly available in the vicinity?
2. What sorts of subsistence or resource-procurement activities are indicated by the cultural materials
present at the sites? In particular, is there evidence of agricultural activities?
3. What do documented cultural materials indicate about the duration and intensity of activity at the sites?
4. Are different activities, or differences in the durations and intensities of activities, indicated by differing site locations relative to local drainage catchments or playa margins?
5. Are sites preferentially situated in some locations relative to local drainage catchments and playa
margins?
6. How do the small and large sites identified in these catchments fit into broader regional patterns of
settlement and land use?
7. Are there differing scales of feature and artifact clustering, and if so, what implications do these in
terms of understanding past land use?
8. Is there any evidence for the historical-period use of the project area, and if so, how do these data
inform us about ranching and/or homestead land use?
As previously noted, small, ephemeral campsites are commonly dispersed across the basin, and many date
to the Archaic or Early Formative period (see Mauldin 1996; Miller 2005; Whalen 1986). On the other hand,
larger palimpsests have also been identified, often situated on ridges adjacent to depressions or playas (see
Leckman et al. 2008; OâLeary et al. 1997:231). Carmichael (1986:152) has noted that these smaller depressions may have been the foci for gathering activities, whereas larger playas could have been used for
high-water-table farming. The latter strategy was probably used by Late Formative period groups (also
see Whalen 1981). Church and Stoweâs (2006) study of dunal depressions did isolate some general patterns for their set of evaluation sites. Using catchment increments of 1,000 m, they found greater than expected Late Formative period and undetermined prehistoric sites within the first buffer, relatively more
EarlyâLate Formative period sites in the second buffer, and somewhat more than expected Archaic period
sites in the third buffer. This generally supports Carmichaelâs perspective of generalized foraging occurring through time, but with a greater emphasis on dunal depressions during the Late Formative period. As
Church and Stowe (2006:78) pointed out, Harlanâs (2002) study also noted the importance of these areas
for long-term foraging but suggested that Late Formative period site locations were actually selected to
provide access to several playas or depressions.
The conclusions drawn by Church and Stowe (2006) are not entirely relevant to the present study, because their analysis considered a group of specific sites selected for evaluation and testing across a broad
swath of the basin, rather than a survey data set drawn from a single area. Nonetheless, many of the general patterns they observed are also present within the current data set. As the analysis conducted in Chapter 8 demonstrates, lithic-artifact classes tend to be located closer to fault-trough playas than ceramics, but
both lithics and ceramics are overrepresented at distances between 300 and 900 m from playa margins,
roughly corresponding to the first buffer employed by Church and Stowe. This includes both Early and Late
Formative period wares, although Late Formative period El Paso Polychrome is typically found at somewhat longer distances from playas. Both early and late ceramic wares are dramatically overrepresented at
distances beyond 900 m from playas, however, broadly corresponding to Church and Stoweâs results for

300

the second 1,000-m buffer. Observations made at greater distances from playas are not relevant here, as
the entire project area falls within 2,000 m of a playa.
The spatial distribution of documented cultural materials within the project area appears to indicate
the importance of playa margins as activity zones throughout prehistoric times, with a particularly close
association indicated for features and areas of high lithic density. The near absence of ceramics in high
densities from these zones may indicate that their use precedes the Formative period. However, it is also
probably an indication that the activities conducted along playa margins simply did not involve the use of
ceramics in great quantities. Many high-density lithic zones, for instance, are located on or near the scarp
of the highest dune ridge, a location that affords excellent visibility across the surrounding playas and
would likely have served as a useful lookout for hunting and game procurement. Conversely, this relatively elevated area might not have been a zone conducive to agriculture.
High-density ceramic areas are typically located at greater distances from playas, but the activities
these zones represent were nonetheless probably linked to playa use. Importantly, high-density ceramic
zones are concentrated on a relatively low dune ridge at the southwest edge of the project area, adjacent to
the deepest playa in the vicinity. This location would presumably have been useful for agriculture and plantresource procurement.
As discussed in Chapter 8, an examination of clustering patterns present in the project area demonstrates that significant patterns of spatial association are present within the lithic, ceramic, and feature assemblages. All three material classes display statistically significant clustering at short distances, representing individual high-density clusters that are grouped into broader, looser patterns of association. In
the case of ceramics and features, these broader, multicluster groupings appear to be fairly tightly clustered, whereas individual high-density lithic areas are more loosely associated.
Isolated historical-period artifacts were observed at only three site locations. Several pieces of purple
glass were identified at FB 6773; a makerâs mark used by Thatcher Manufacturing Company indicates
that they date to the early 1910s through the 1920s. White-bodied earthenware sherds, glass shards, various metal artifacts, and ammunition boxes were also identified at FB 6774. Lastly, a scatter of glass,
metal cans, and an oil bottle were recorded at FB 6754.

Technology, Mobility, and Social Boundaries
How people positioned themselves across the landscape was directly linked with the distribution of rainfall and of plant and animal populations. Changes in resource structure required changes in settlement organization and, possibly, subsistence strategies. The basic subsistence needs of prehistoric populations required not only technology (facilities and tools) but also labor. The survival of a forager depended on being
in the right place at the right time and having the appropriate technology. Therefore, mobility was critical
to gathering information on the distribution of subsistence resources. In contrast, agricultural societies relied on exchange networks to provide backup strategies in case of local resource shortfalls. These networks often involved the exchange of various goods among group members located in different communities. Over time, the occupants of the Hueco Bolson developed various economic strategies to survive the
changing natural and cultural environment, including a mix of foraging and cultivation.
Mobility has often been linked with technology. For example, some researchers consider that mobility
limits the size and number of tools that a group can efficiently carry (Carr 1994; Ebert 1979). Others argue that bifaces are portable tools that can also act as multipurpose tools for mobile groups, whereas
simple flake technologies are expedient and sufficient for sedentary groups (Parry and Kelly 1987). In addition, studies have identified differences in stone-tool technology when comparing various Archaic period
campsites with habitation sites: the former emphasize biface production and maintenance, and the latter, a
mix of core reduction and tool production and maintenance. Agricultural campsites tend to resemble Archaic period habitations, and agricultural villages emphasize core reduction (Roth 1998; Vierra 2003, 2005).
301

Ceramic technology has also been linked with mobility and the importance of multifunctional tecomates
versus more-specialized vessels for cooking, storage, and consumption activities at residentially stable
communities (Heckman et al. 2008; Miller and Burt 2007; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Recent research has identified important changes in regional forager and agricultural social networks.
These changes partly reflect changing foraging strategies from the Paleoindian through the Archaic period.
Folsom groups presumably moved great distances while hunting bison, a tactic that would have been especially successful in areas adjacent to seasonal playas (Amick 1994). Early Archaic period groups witnessed a shift to warmer and drier conditions during the Middle Holocene period and presumably moved
out of the southern deserts to more-favorable climes. Middle Archaic period groups resumed the seasonal
use of the area in response to increasing climatic amelioration, as revealed by evidence of movement from
the north, south, and east (Miller 2002; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). McBrinnâs (2005) recent study of Late
Archaic period projectile points identified regional social networks that linked the Mogollon cave sites with
rockshelters in the nearby Sacramento Mountains.
Long-term changes in regional social networks continued through the Early, Middle, and Late Formative periods. Late Archaic period ties to the west appear to have continued during the Early Formative period, as evidenced by Mimbres Black-on-white ceramics present at some Mesilla phase sites. As Miller
(2005) has pointed out, the Middle Formative period is set within a regional backdrop of the Pueblo IâII
and is transitional to Classic periods to the north and west, respectively, whereas the Late Formative period is set within the Classic and Medio periods to the north and south, respectively. Therefore, it appears
that the Jornada Mogollon forager-cultivators were primarily observers, whereas other regional groups had
more-significant influence on the region in terms of long-term cultural change. This research issue addresses the technology and cultural interaction research domains.

Research Questions
1. What is the nature of the assemblage variability represented among the project sites, and what is the
implication of these data for understanding changes in mobility and technology?
2. What materials, forms, and types of lithic and ceramic artifacts are present, and what are their implications for understanding changes in technology, mobility, and social interaction?
3. What raw-material types are represented by the lithic artifacts present on sites identified by the project, and what is the geographic range of these materials?
4. What is the geographic range of the ceramic artifacts represented at the project sites?
A total of 1,033 lithic artifacts were recorded during the survey (Table 269). The majority of these were
flaked stone artifacts, with only 258 ground stone items recorded. Thirty-eight percent of flaked stone artifacts were made of chert, and 25 percent were made of basalt, with lesser amounts of other materials.
The retouched tools and cores exhibited a similar range of variability and included retouched flakes, unifaces, bifaces, and projectile points. In addition, two tested cobbles made of chert were also identified.
Chert was presumably obtained from local sources, including surface lag gravels and nearby formations
in the Franklin Mountains. A variety of materials were selected for ground artifacts, mostly consisting of
quartzite, granite, sandstone, and basalt, with fewer of other material types. These lithic materials can also
be obtained from local sources. Although there was a range of ground stone artifacts recorded, the majority
of these were undetermined pieces of ground stone, with mano and metate fragments. Otherwise, onehanded manos were the most-prevalent artifacts identified to a specific type. The ground stone fragments
were probably discarded when exhausted; however, some of the useable manos and metates were presumably cached in anticipation of future use (i.e., site furniture). The presence of a single two-handed mano
probably reflects the recycling of this item from a nearby habitation site. Leckman et al. (2008) also identified trough-metate fragments that were reused at logistical-site locations (Leckman et al. 2008). Nonetheless, there appears to be little evidence of Formative period recycling in the ground stone assemblages.

Otherwise, the variability exhibited by the lithic artifacts would appear to reflect generalized foraging activities.
FCR (n = 2,829) was the most prevalent artifact recorded during the survey project, representing isolated concentrations or dispersed scatters. The majority of these items were composed of limestone, basalt,
granite, caliche, and quartzite, with fewer of other material types. All of these are locally available and
were presumably selected based on their abundance. On the other hand, igneous materials would retain
heat for a longer period of time and could have been reused. Although quartzite does not retain heat as
well as igneous rocks, it could have also been reused if necessary. Lastly, limestone and caliche do not
retain heat and would rapidly deteriorate with use (Lintz 1989; Pierce 1984). Although local resource
abundance may have been an important criterion for selecting raw materials, the specific function of the
thermal feature and the projected use life of the feature could have also been important factors. Lastly, the
effect of raw-material scarcity could have been offset by integrating ground stone artifacts into these features. This would have been especially important if these artifacts were made of material types that were
not readily available. As previously noted, many of the ground stone artifacts were made of quartzite,
granite, and basalt, with the majority of these items being burned. It would therefore appear that ground
stone artifacts made of materials conducive to retaining heat were often selected for reuse.
A total of 432 ceramic artifacts were recorded during the survey (Table 270). Not surprisingly, the majority of these were classified as El Paso brownware, with some El Paso Polychrome and other types.
Chupadero Black-on-white, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, and Playas Red Incised were the only potentially nonlocal types identified; however, there is evidence that Chupadero Black-on-white was produced
in the northern Tularosa Basin, as is the case for Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, and there is a local variety of Playas Red Incised. Therefore, all of the ceramic types could have been produced within the basin
by the site occupants or may have been obtained through exchange with other local groups.
Projectile points provide some limited evidence for the Paleoindian and Archaic period occupation of
the project area. As previously noted, this contrasts with the numerous Archaic period radiocarbon dates
obtained from the basin. The Paleoindian period point was identified by a previous project and consists of
a Midland point fragment. The majority of the projectile points identified during the SRI survey were Late
Archaic period points (n = 19), with fewer Middle Archaic period points (see Appendix G). No Early Archaic period points were observed, and no arrow points were observed. The six Middle Archaic period
points were equally divided between San Joseâlike and Langtry-like types. It has been suggested that
Early Archaic period groups moved out of the Borderlands during the Middle Holocene dry period, followed by the return of Middle Archaic period groups during climatic amelioration. In addition, San Joseâ
style projectile points might reflect northern-based groups, versus Langtry-style pointsâ reflecting southern-based groups (Carpenter et al. 2005; Mabry et al. 2008; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). All three Langtry-style points exhibited snap breaks about halfway down the blades, with only one of the blades exhibiting serration. None showed signs of having been resharpened. All three San Joseâstyle points exhibited
some variability with respect to their blades. One blade was serrated and showed no signs of resharpening,
a second point was heavily resharpened, and the third point had a broken tip and a beveled blade. All
three blades appeared to exhibit different tactics of extending tool-use life that was not evident in the
Langtry-style points. Nonetheless, Miller and Kenmotsu (2004) noted the importance of beveling and resharpening among Middle Archaic period points. A more detailed technological study of these two point
types is certainly required. Most of the Late Archaic period points are stemmed or corner notched, with
little evidence of resharpening. Again, this represents a different technology from that reflected in the
Middle Archaic period.
In summary, studies of Middle Archaic period points indicate a tactic geared toward extending tooluse life and greater mobility, with a few types used to hunt a variety of game; Late Archaic period points
appear to reflect a shorter use life, decreased mobility, and the use of multiple point types for specific
hunting tactics (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Vierra et al. 1999; Vierra forthcoming). Therefore, the common
pattern of finding numerous Late Archaic period points and fewer Middle Archaic period points may not
reflect increased levels of occupational intensity but, rather, shorter tool-use life.

National Register of Historic Places and
Management Recommendations
A. C. MacWilliams

NRHP Evaluation
This project was initiated under the 1996 Fort Bliss significance standards (Abbot et al. 1996). Project
completion coincides with the implementation of revised standards (Miller, Kenmotsu, et al. 2009). The
revised Fort Bliss Significance Standards implements a two-tiered approach toward the evaluation of site
eligibility (Miller, Kenmotsu, et al. 2009) that is largely adhered to in evaluating sites for this project. The
first evaluation tier requires both spatial and stratigraphic integrity of archaeological materials, in addition
to chronometric dating potential. This evaluation standard is used to establish the temporal context and integrity of cultural deposits necessary for a site to empirically address research questions. If the site first
satisfies both of these criteria, it is then evaluated in terms of satisfying specific data requirements related to one or more historic contexts. Although a site may contain datable features, the absence of related material remains prohibits the establishment of an interpretable association.
The second tier incorporates into the eligibility threshold the research significance of a site relating to
various themes, such as subsistence, technology, site formation, settlement patterns, and social organization within specific geomorphic settings and chronological frameworks. However, in conformance with
the project POW (Vierra et al. 2008), the sites are approached with research themes that have their roots
in the original significance standards. Methodological implementation of either cohort of research themes
is much the same. This involves a critical appraisal of the association or relationship among archaeological
manifestations, aspects of assemblage content, and corroborative chronometric data. At this level, the evaluation requires a consideration of the potential of the site to address specific historic contexts and yield
data relevant to these research domains. These data requirements are based on explicit quantitative and
statistical qualities of artifact assemblages and mandate that sufficient quantities of artifacts or relevant material classes must be correlated within a datable context in order to yield information that can be applied
toward the study of one or more historic contexts. This revised eligibility-evaluation procedure was formulated to promote the consideration of research potential for each site within a broader and more-comprehensive analytical and theoretical framework, in which the interrelationship of data and research domains are explicitly examined (Miller, Church, et al. 2009).

Recommendations
In sum, 55 sites were newly recorded, and 44 sites that meet current site definition criteria were relocated
and updated in the survey area over the course of the archaeological survey. Of the 99 sites, 19 are recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, all under Criterion d (Table 271). The remaining 80 sites are
recommended not eligible because of their lack of integrity, significance, and/or research potential. A total of 87 previously recorded sites having TARL trinomial numbers do not meet current site criteria and
therefore are recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP (see Table 271); 37 previously recorded
sites without TARL trinomial numbers also do not meet current Fort Bliss site definition criteria.

All sites recommended eligible fall under Criterion d.
Does not meet site criteria.

FB 6273 (41EP1892)
FB 6273 is a multicomponent campsite composed of 24 features and a dense artifact scatter that includes
a diverse assortment of lithic and ceramic materials. The site is situated among large coppice dunes, with
cultural materials visible in interdunal blowouts. Nearly two-thirds of the features contain intact datable
deposits. As originally suggested by Foster (1993) when referring to a much smaller incarnation of FB 6273,
this site is composed of numerous components, the earliest of which date from the Middle Archaic period.
Although there has been disturbance to the site from many causes, including partial excavation, substan313

tial portions of FB 6273 remain well preserved. The complexity of the assemblage attests to the value of
this location over an extended period of time.
The site exhibits good integrity, with some relatively intact and datable features, in conjunction with a
substantial assemblage including temporally and culturally diagnostic artifacts. These data could be used
to address various Archaic and Formative period research issues, including land use, site-formation processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6273 is therefore recommended eligible for listing
in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6754 (41EP1852)
FB 6754 is a multicomponent site composed of 30 features and an artifact scatter that contains several
concentrations. Twenty-one features contain materials suitable for absolute dating within the context of
extensive, intact site deposits. These features are widely distributed across the site and might provide
distinct age estimates for these areas and associated artifact concentrations. Diagnostic projectile points
provide evidence for Middle and Late Archaic components, and El Paso brownware ceramics indicate a
Formative period component. Artifact counts are robust and include a variety of materials and artifact
types.
The site exhibits good dating potential, evidence of intact deposits, and a substantial, diverse assemblage. These data could be used to address various Archaic and Early Formative research issues, including
land use, site-formation processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6754 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6773 (41EP1638)
FB 6773 represents the accumulation of multiple occupations distributed over a very large area. The site
exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity and is situated on top of an elevated location with a clear
view of the surrounding terrain. Two large stains may be structures, and the substantial, diverse assemblage is indicative of a residential occupation(s). Forty-five features were identified, including stains and
FCR/burned-rock concentrations. Nearly 85 percent of the features contain datable materials. Although
many of the features are situated in the southern portion of the site, there are groups of 2â3 features present in several areas. The abundance and nature of the features suggest that FB 6773 was used as a residential site and temporary campsite. The artifact assemblage contains a diverse array of flaked stone, ground
stone, and ceramic items. Artifacts, the oldest of which may date to the Paleoindian (Renn et al. 2008) or
Early Archaic period (Sale 2007), provide evidence of a long and complex occupational history on this
landform. In summary, the site exhibits geomorphic integrity, can be absolutely and relatively dated, contains a diverse assemblage, and may reflect both residential and seasonal use of the area. Data from this
site could be used to address various Archaic and Formative research themes, including land use, site-formation processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology. Therefore, FB 6773 is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6774 (41EP1867)
FB 6774 is an extensive, multicomponent site with over 100 features, a substantial artifact scatter, and a
sparse historical-period artifact scatter. The site has been heavily disturbed, although the presence of numerous ash stains and burned-rock features attest to the partial integrity of the area. There are many
small clusters of features that could reflect discrete activity areas or separate occupations. The majority of
the features (n = 92) remain intact and contain ash/charcoal. The Q3 sand that is discontinuously present
can be expected to contain preserved cultural deposits. Approximately 1,000 artifacts are estimated, in314

cluding a range of lithic and ceramic items. Lastly, a few historical-period artifacts were also identified.
The site exhibits good geomorphic integrity, can be absolutely and relatively dated, contains a diverse
assemblage, and could contain Formative period habitation structures and spatially distinct feature clusters. These data could be used to address various EarlyâLate Formative research themes, including land
use, site-formation processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology. The site is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6776 (41EP1645)
FB 6776 is composed of an artifact scatter and 24 features. Although the site is situated within an interdunal setting, it appears to exhibit good geomorphic integrity. The features consist of 23 stains and 1 burnedrock cluster, distributed across the site, with many centrally located. The FCR feature is the only feature
at the site that does not contain ash and charcoal flecks. At least 1 of the stains contained large pieces of
large charcoal. There is a substantial and diverse assemblage of lithic and ceramic artifacts, including
El Paso Polychrome sherds. Data from this site could be used to address Late Formative research themes,
including land use, the logistic exploitation of basin settings, site structure, subsistence, and technology.
FB 6776 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6778 (41EP1925)
FB 6778 is a multicomponent site composed of 13 thermal features and a dense and diverse artifact scatter.
Artifact diversity is impressive, with numerous formal tools identified. Although the site is situated
among coppice dunes and eroded interdunal blowouts, it exhibits a high degree of geomorphic integrity.
The features consist of ashy stains and burned-rock clusters, with at least 9 of these intact and containing
datable materials. Two clusters of features are present in the northeastern and southwestern sections of
the site and may represent discrete activity areas or separate occupations. Data from FB 6778 could be
used to address EarlyâMiddle Formative research issues, including land use, site structure, subsistence,
and technology. FB 6778 is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6816 (41EP1953)
FB 6816 is a multicomponent site with 14 thermal features and a high-density artifact scatter. There is a
cluster of features situated in the northern area, with features more dispersed in the southern portion of
FB 6816. The artifact assemblage is diverse, with a large number of items distributed across the site.
Lithic artifacts are composed of a variety of materials and include a number of formal tools and temporally diagnostic artifacts from both the Middle and Late Archaic periods. Additionally, diagnostic ceramics dating from the MiddleâLate Formative period were identified. Although the site is situated among
coppice dunes and deflated interdunal blowouts, it exhibits fair geomorphic integrity. Notably, charcoal
deposits were found in a shovel test into Q3 deposits at this site. The site has excellent chronometric
potential, with all of the recorded features containing intact deposits. Data from this multicomponent
campsite could be used to address MiddleâLate Archaic and MiddleâLate Formative research issues,
including land use, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6816 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

315

FB 6823 (41EP1622)
FB 6823 is a Late Formative period campsite with a disturbed burned-rock feature, an intact ash stain, and
an associated artifact scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity and is situated in a coppice-dune field, with artifacts and features visible in eroded interdunal blowouts. Only one of the two features is intact and retains potential to contain datable materials. A moderate quantity of flaked stone artifacts is present. Sherds of several types place this site in the Late Formative period. Although this site can
be relatively dated, and potentially radiocarbon dated, the limited scope of the assemblage and the presence of only two features limits the siteâs capacity for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 6823 is
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 6824 (41EP1623)
FB 6824 was originally recorded during Whalenâs (1977) survey project in Maneuver Areas 1 and 2; he
documented a small campsite with a light artifact scatter and no thermal features. The site was visited
again by UTEP in 1990, as part of the Loop 375 project (OâLaughlin 1987). At that time, it consisted of one
thermal feature and a sparse artifact scatter. Polychromes were identified, which suggested an El Paso
phase occupation.
LMAS returned to the site in 2001 and described one thermal feature and a scatter of almost 700 flaked
stone, ground stone, and ceramic artifacts, including El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-white, and
possible Chihuahuan wares (Church and Stowe 2006). Disturbances to the site at that time included alluvial
and aeolian erosion, vehicle traffic, and the construction of Loop 375. Only 25 percent of the site remained
intact during the LMAS visit. Ten 10-cm-deep trowel tests were placed in and around the lone feature, but
no subsurface cultural materials were identified. Despite the fact that no subsurface materials were encountered, the density and diversity of the artifact assemblage and the potential for buried deposits, based on
the presence of deep aeolian sediments, led LMAS to recommend the site eligible for listing in the NRHP,
under criterion d (Church and Stowe 2006:I-148).
In 2008, data-recovery efforts were undertaken by TRC at FB 6824 (Project 07-45). Forty-three backhoe
trenches were excavated across the site (Condon et al. 2009). Thirty-six features were identified and included
FCR concentrations, stains, a rectangular pit house, a collared hearth, a midden, 2 surface rooms, and 2 trash
pits. Six variably sized units, ranging from 2 by 2 m to 8 by 13 m, were excavated around the features. Over
9,000 artifacts, most of which were diagnostic ceramics, were recovered during the data-recovery process.
The site was assigned a primary El Paso phase component based on an AMS range of A.D. 1280â1420
(Condon et al. 2009:191), but diagnostic ceramics (El Paso Brown, Alma Plain, Jornada Brown, and Mimbres
Black-on-white) suggest an Early Formative period component (A.D. 200â1100), as well.
SRI revisited FB 6824 during the survey and recorded a total of 14 positive TRUs within the previous
site boundary. One highly disturbed ash stain was identified, along with over 200 ceramic and flaked stone
artifacts. El Paso brownware, El Paso Brown, El Paso Decorated, and Lincoln Black-on-red ceramics were
identified. Fifteen pieces of debitage and 1 retouched piece of chert composed the lithic assemblage.
FB 6824 has been mitigated through data recovery.

FB 6829 (41EP1640)
FB 6829 consists of eight features and numerous lithic and ceramic artifacts. The site exhibits generally
good geomorphic integrity, including six intact features that have the potential to yield datable materials.
A single mesquite-charcoal sample previously reported a calibrated date of A.D. 1310â1345 (Renn et al.
2008:52). This age estimate is consistent with the presence of El Paso Polychrome; Mimbres Black-onwhite sherds presumably indicate an earlier occupation. The assemblage contains a diverse suite of lithic
and ceramic artifacts that probably reflect the remains of multiple EarlyâLate Formative period campsites.
316

Data could be obtained from this site that would address EarlyâLate Formative research themes, including
land use, logistic use of the basin, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6829 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6831 (41EP1647)
FB 6831 was mitigated by LMAS in 2002 (Church et al. 2007). The site was originally identified by Whalen
(1978) and subsequently revisited by Lukowski and Stuart (1996). It was situated within an interdunal
blowout and consisted of 3 FCR concentrations, 2 stains, and an associated lithic and ceramic scatter. The
site was attributed to the Early Formative period based on the presence of approximately 30 El Paso brownware sherds and a single El Paso Brown sherd. A total of 27 features were excavated during the LMAS datarecovery program. These consisted of 12 FCR concentrations, 12 stains, a bell-shaped pit, and 2 structures.
The structures consist of simple basin-shaped features that were 2â3 m in diameter and filled with charcoalstained soil. Three radiocarbon dates were obtained from a thermal feature, the bell-shaped pit, and a structure and yielded calibrated intercepts of A.D. 530, 580, and 770, respectively.
SRI revisited FB 6831 during the survey and recorded a total of 24 positive TRUs within the previous
2
site boundary, which encompasses an area of 41,690 m (see Figure 25). These TRUs include a modest
quantity of ceramics, with one El Paso Polychrome sherd, some flaked stone, one piece of ground stone,
and scattered FCR. No additional features were recorded. As FB 6831 has been mitigated (Church et al.
2007), the site requires no further evaluation.

FB 6832 (41EP1672)
FB 6832 includes a single ashy stain with spatially associated artifacts. The site exhibits limited geomorphic integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes, with cultural materials exposed in deflated interdunal
blowouts. A single ashy stain is highly disturbed and offers little potential to yield datable materials.
Lithic artifact counts are low, although several Late Formative ceramic types were located. This site is
interpreted to be a repeatedly used camp and task location. In light of the small scope of the site, the limited geomorphic integrity, and the uncertainties about dating, FB 6832 is recommended not eligible for
listing in the NRHP.

FB 6836 (41EP1894)
FB 6836 is a Late Formative period campsite that consists of a low-density scatter of lithics, ceramics, and
dispersed FCR. The site is situated amid coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts; it retains no more than
fair geomorphic integrity. No datable deposits were observed. El Paso Polychrome ceramics do indicate
Late Formative period occupation of the site. Because of its questionable geomorphic integrity (as demonstrated by the disappearance of features since the 1976 UTEP survey), its lack of prospects for absolute
dating, and its limited assemblage, FB 6836 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 6837 (41EP1887)
FB 6837 is a Late Formative period campsite that contains one thermal feature and a high-density ceramic and lithic scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity The feature is a minimally disturbed ashy stain and contains charcoal flecks that have the potential for radiocarbon dating.
The presence of datable deposits and the dense, diverse artifact scatter demonstrate that data from this
site could be used to address MiddleâLate Formative period research themes, including land use, logistical
317

use of the Hueco Bolson, site structure, subsistence, and technology. For these reasons, FB 6837 is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 6839 (41EP1898)
FB 6839 is a multicomponent site with numerous thermal features and an extensive artifact scatter and is
situated in a coppice-dune setting. The site has geomorphic integrity, as indicated by the condition of features and the extent of preserved Q3 horizons. The results of this survey are consistent with previous
projects in recognizing an extended period of occupation in this location, which appears to have been
repeatedly occupied during the Formative period. The slightly higher elevation and overview of a nearby
playa to the north-northwest may have made this an attractive camping location.
The 16 features and almost 1,000 artifacts attest to substantial use of the slight rise upon which FB 6839
is located. Almost 70 percent of the features have the potential to yield datable materials. In addition, the
substantial site assemblage contains a diverse array of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramic artifacts.
This assemblage can be used to address a variety of research issues, particularly pertaining to subsistence
and technology. As a result, we concur with the previous recommendation of Church and Stowe (2006:1â
154) that FB 6839 is eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d. The New Mexico SHPO concurred
with the original recommendation in 2006.

FB 6842 (41EP1934)
FB 6842 is a multicomponent site consisting of thermal features and artifact concentrations. The site is situated along a low rise overlooking a playa. Although overall geomorphic integrity at FB 6842 is poor,
there are well-preserved locations within the site having potential for cultural deposits. Some of the features have been completely deflated, but there are seven intact stains that contain datable material. The
El Paso Brown and El Paso Polychrome ceramics suggests the presence of both EarlyâMiddle Formative and Late Formative period occupations. Concentrations and clusters of features are discernable,
reflecting discrete activity areas or separate occupations. The presence of potentially datable deposits in
most of the features may be able to clarify this situation. Artifact counts are not particularly high, but a diversity of artifact types and materials exists. Data from FB 6842 could be used to address EarlyâLate Formative research themes, including land use, logistic use of the basin, site-formation processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology. FB 6842 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP,
under Criterion d.

FB 6881 (41EP1643)
FB 6881 is a multicomponent site consisting of a highly dense ceramic scatter with a smaller quantity of
lithic artifacts. No features were observed at this site. The site retains minimal geomorphic integrity.
Numerous artifacts included a variety of ceramic types dating from the EarlyâLate Formative periods. Although the lithic assemblage includes only a couple dozen pieces of flaked stone and less ground stone,
there are a variety of materials and types. The substantial ceramic assemblage offers the potential to address research issues related to ceramic production and technology. However, poor geomorphic context
and the absence of datable features preclude placing these artifacts within an absolute temporal context.
Therefore, FB 6881 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

318

FB 6885 (41EP1669)
FB 6885 is an extensive lithic and ceramic scatter that encompasses 27 separate sites originally recorded
by Whalen (1978). These sites include FB 6789, FB 6833, FB 6885, FB 6886, FB 6887, FB 6888, FB 6889,
FB 6890, FB 6891, FB 6892, FB 6893, FB 6898, FB 7924, FB 7925, FB 7926, FB 7927, FB 8049, FB 8050,
FB 8051, FB 8052, FB 8053, FB 8092, FB 10344, FB 114442, FB 11443, FB 11444, and FB 11504. To2
gether they cover approximately 805,175 m and include approximately 30 FCR concentrations, 30 stains,
2 middens, 1500 lithic artifacts, and 5,000 ceramic artifacts. The assemblage includes diagnostic artifacts
that indicate Paleoindian, Archaic, and Formative period occupations.
FB 6885 has a previous recommendation for NRHP eligibility under criterion d (Lukowski and Stuart
1996:H-48) that is based on observations made outside the current project area. The portion of this site
that is within the 5,000-acre project area does not contribute to this eligibility, as there are only modest
quantities of artifacts spread over a sizeable area and just one feature offers any potential for radiocarbon
dating.

FB 7685 (41EP1600)
FB 7685 is a small, single feature, a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. Although the FCR/caliche concentration does contain some
charcoal flecking, it is moderately disturbed. The site assemblage has merely one retouched flake and
dispersed FCR, and this rules out addressing any research issues. As a result, FB 7685 is recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7721 (41EP1966)
FB 7721 is situated on a slight rise within a coppice-dune setting. The site includes multiple occupations,
with over 60 features and several hundred artifacts distributed over a sizeable area. The site is well preserved, as attested to by the numerous intact features containing datable deposits. Although features are
distributed across FB 7721, there are two main clusters in the southern end of the site. These clusters
could reflect discrete activity areas or multiple occupation episodes. A variety of lithic and ceramic artifacts are present, with ceramic types suggesting recurrent use of the site throughout the Formative period. Data from the site could be used to address EarlyâLate Formative research issues, including land
use, the logistical use of the basin, site-formation processes, site structure, subsistence, and technology.
FB 7721 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 7908 (41EP1841)
FB 7908 is a Late Formative period campsite consisting of a thermal feature and a low-density artifact
scatter. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. The single ashy stain is moderately disturbed and has a low potential for yielding datable materials. In addition, artifact counts are insufficient to
provide information suitable for addressing any research issues. Therefore, FB 7908 is recommended not
eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7909 (41EP1598)
FB 7909 is a multicomponent site composed of a low-density lithic- and ceramic-artifact scatter, with no
associated features. The site exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity. The lack of thermal features
319

prevents retrieving datable materials. The assemblage contains a variety of artifacts, including Middleâ
Late Archaic projectile points and El Paso Polychrome sherds. Although this assemblage does have the
potential to address research issues, it reflects multiple, unrelated occupations and cannot be associated
with absolute dates. Therefore, FB 7909 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7914 (41EP1645)
FB 7914 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation situated on a slight rise in a coppicedune setting. The site retains poor geomorphic integrity. The FCR concentration, which is the one feature
at this site, does contain ashy deposits that could yield datable materials; however, only a single lithic artifact was recorded in the vicinity of the feature. Because the assemblage lacks the potential to address research issues, FB 7914 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7916 (41EP1842)
FB 7916 is a Formative period campsite or activity area with a moderately dense lithic- and ceramic-artifact scatter. The site is located among coppice dunes, with cultural materials visible in interdunal blowouts.
No features were observed, effectively ruling out obtaining absolute dates from the site. El Paso brownware ceramics do place FB 7916 in the Formative period. Artifact counts are relatively low, and this featureless site cannot provide absolute dates. As FB 7916 cannot provide adequate data for investigating
research issues, it is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7918 (41EP1595)
FB 7918 is a small Formative period camp that includes three thermal features and a moderately dense
artifact scatter. The site has poor geomorphic integrity. A single intact, ashy stain potentially could provide datable materials from preserved fill. The few El Paso brownware sherds observed indicate a Formative period affiliation for this campsite. The spatial arrangement of features and artifacts offers the possibility that discrete activity areas or separate occupations are included within this relatively small site.
However, the small scale of the site, the poor geomorphic integrity, and the prospect of only one datable
feature make it improbable that data from the site could be used to adequately address research issues.
FB 7918 is therefore recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7920 (41EP1594)
FB 7920 is a small Formative period camp with two thermal features and a low-density artifact scatter.
Although much of the site appears to be intact, neither feature has the potential to provide datable materials. Artifact counts are very low, with little diversity in types. This site cannot provide data for addressing research issues and is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 7928 (41EP1593)
FB 7928 has three thermal features and several dozen artifacts. Although the site is situated within an interdunal area, overall geomorphic integrity is good. The large stain may indicate a structure. The smaller,
well-preserved stain could potentially yield datable materials. El Paso brownware sherds suggest a Formative period component, although the structure might date from the Mesilla phase. These data could be used
320

to address Formative period research issues, including land use, site structure, subsistence, and technology.
FB 7928 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 7932 (41EP1875)
FB 7932 is interpreted to be a Late Archaic campsite with thermal features and an associated low-density
lithic scatter. The site exhibits good geomorphic integrity, although the FCR concentration and the ashy
stain are disturbed and do not contain datable materials. The small lithic assemblage includes a variety of
flaked and ground stone artifacts, with a single Late Archaic projectile point. However, the flaked stone is
dispersed over a large area, potentially lack contemporaneity, and does not contain sufficient information
potential to address research issues. For these reasons, FB 7932 is recommended not eligible for listing in
the NRHP.

FB 7938 (41EP1868)
FB 7938 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of thermal features and a lowdensity artifact scatter. The site does appear to have generally good geomorphic integrity. All of the stain
features contain datable materials, offering good potential for obtaining radiocarbon dates from this site.
There is a light, diverse scatter of lithic artifacts. This site could provide data usable for addressing several research issues, including land use, low-density and low-intensity occupations in the Hueco Bolson,
subsistence, and technology. FB 7938 is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, under
criterion d.

FB 7939 (41EP1856)
FB 7939 is a Late Formative period camp consisting of numerous thermal features and an associated
moderate-density artifact scatter. The site exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity. It is situated
among dunes, with artifacts and features exposed in interdunal blowouts. All nine of the intact features
contain deposits potentially suitable for obtaining absolute dates. Therefore, the site has excellent chronometric potential. It is also possible that charcoal from at least some of these features may provide
macrobotanical samples suitable for investigating subsistence and resource selection. The flaked stone
assemblage could provide data about technology. FB 7939 is therefore recommended eligible for listing
in the NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 7946 (41EP1886)
FB 7946 is, at least in part, a Late Formative site composed of thermal features and a moderately dense
scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts. Geomorphic integrity of the site is variable and generally low.
However, there are features with charcoal that can probably provide radiocarbon dates. One feature contains calcined bone and potentially is a source of unique subsistence data. The wide distribution of features probably reflects multiple occupations by different groups over time.
The lithic assemblage includes a variety of flaked and ground stone artifacts that could be used to address research domains of technology and subsistence. The ceramic assemblage is not large but also could
provide data about chronology, technology, and possibly subsistence. There is also potential for obtaining
subsistence data from faunal remains. Therefore, FB 7946 is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP
under Criterion d.
321

FB 7949 (41EP2502)
FB 7949 is a Formative period campsite consisting of two thermal features and an associated moderatedensity artifact scatter. The lithic assemblage does contain a diversity of flaked and ground stone artifacts
that are sufficient to address research issues concerned with technology but cannot be placed within a
dated context. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity and is situated within wide interdunal blowouts between coppice dunes. Although remnants of thermal features are present, no datable
deposits were evident. Because of these limitations, FB 7949 is recommended not eligible for listing in
the NRHP.

FB 7957 (41EP1926)
FB 7957 is a small prehistoric camp of unknown temporal affiliation located in a coppice-dune field, with
cultural materials visible in interdunal blowouts. The site has poor geomorphic integrity. There are two
ashy stains with a low-density lithic-artifact scatter; these stains are disturbed and offer low potential to
yield datable materials. Although the lithic assemblage does contain a variety of artifacts, there are too
few to adequately address any research issues. Therefore, FB 7957 is recommended not eligible for listing
in the NRHP.

FB 7960 (41EP1940)
FB 7960 is a very small EarlyâMiddle Formative period campsite consisting of a single ashy stain and a
low-density artifact scatter. The site is relatively intact and is situated among low coppice dunes sloping
gently toward a playa. The single feature contains deposits that potentially could provide absolute dates
for the site; however, the few pieces of debitage and ceramics do not contain sufficient information to address any research issues. Therefore, FB 7960 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 8058 (41EP1639)
FB 8058 is a small Formative period campsite consisting of thermal features and a low-density artifact
scatter. This site is situated in an interdunal area. The site exhibits a moderate degree of geomorphic
integrity. Both ashy features contain materials with potential for providing absolute dates; however, the
small lithic- and ceramic-artifact assemblage is insufficient for addressing any research issues. Therefore,
FB 8058 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 8083 (41EP1928)
Largely relying on evidence from past projects, FB 8083 is interpreted to be a multicomponent site that
includes thermal features with a moderately dense artifact scatter. The site is situated among coppice
dunes and interdunal blowouts and exhibits poor geomorphic integrity. FB 8083 is interpreted to be a
campsite and activity area with at least three occupations, during the Paleoindian period, the Formative
period, and approximately 1 century ago. The flaked stone assemblage possibly could provide informative
data about technology and resource selection. However, of the three recorded features at this site, only the
stain offers good potential for radiocarbon dating. Therefore, FB 8083 is recommended not eligible for
listing in the NRHP.

322

FB 9711 (41EP2651)
FB 9711 is a previously recorded site that was recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP, largely
based on the possible presence of a structure or structures (Sale 2007:5â17). This recommendation was
concurred with by the New Mexico SHPO. The site is situated among interdunal blowouts surrounded by
large coppice dunes and was evaluated as having lowâfair geomorphic integrity. A single large stain was
relocated, but the two smaller stains were not. The large stain contains charcoal and ash and is only moderately disturbed. FB 9711 is interpreted to be a Late Formative period campsite and potential habitation site that contains ceramics and a few pieces of debitage. This site was previously recommended
eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d (Sale 2007:5â17), and SRI concurs with this recommendation.

FB 9804 (41EP2740)
FB 9804 consists of a Formative period campsite with eight thermal features and a dispersed artifact
scatter. The site is exposed within interdunal blowouts and retains a fair degree of geomorphic integrity.
At least one of the eight ashy stains contains some charcoal that could provide datable materials; however, there are only a few flaked stone and ceramic artifacts, including some brown ware sherds. The association of the artifacts with the features is uncertain, given the dispersed nature of the assemblage and
the extent of disturbance to the site. Therefore, FB 9804 is recommended not eligible for listing in the
NRHP.

FB 9807 (41EP2743)
FB 9807 is a Late Formative period campsite that may contain EarlyâMiddle Formative period components. The site is composed of five ashy stain features and an associated low-density artifact scatter. It exhibits fair geomorphic integrity, and datable materials are present in three features that contain fill with
ashy sediment and charcoal flecking. There is a low-density artifact scatter with a variety of flaked stone,
ground stone, and ceramic artifacts. Data from this site could be used to address Late Formative period
research themes, including land use, logistical use of the basin, subsistence, and technology. Sale (2007:527) recommended FB 9807 eligible for listing in the NRHP, under criterion d, and SRI concurs with this
recommendation.

FB 11474 (41EP6242)
FB 11474 is a Formative period campsite that consists of two thermal features with an associated artifact
scatter. The site exhibits good geomorphic integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes on a ridge overlooking a playa to the southeast. Although the two ashy stains contain charcoal flecking, both are disturbed.
The artifact assemblage is primarily composed of flaked stone, with one piece of ground stone and several
ceramics. A variety of lithic materials are present. Features at this site have potential for radiocarbon
dating; however, the site assemblage is limited, and there are few features. This site cannot provide
substantial data for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 11474 is recommended not eligible for
listing in the NRHP.

323

FB 11488 (41EP6243)
FB 11488 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. The site setting is heavily disturbed, although the one feature at this site is relatively well preserved. The site is situated in an interdunal blowout
among coppice dunes. The site consists of a single ashy stain containing charcoal that could provide absolute dates. There are no associated artifacts, and this site cannot provide data for addressing research issues. For this reason, FB 11488 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 12079 (41EP6244)
FB 12079 is an undated site with seven outdoor hearths or roasting pits and a spatially associated artifact scatter. Preservation of these features is variable. Overall site geomorphic integrity is poor, with extensive areas deeply eroded, although there are also areas of preserved Q3 soil. Fill from several of the
features have the potential to provide radiocarbon dates. The only temporally diagnostic artifact from this
site, a Mimbres Black-on-white sherd, suggests an EarlyâMiddle Formative period component to this
campsite. Total artifact counts are very low, have little diversity, and are distributed over a sizeable area. For
these reasons, data from FB 12079 could not be used to effectively address research issues. Therefore,
FB 12079 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 12084 (41EP6245)
FB 12084 is a Formative period campsite with a single thermal feature and a sparse scatter of lithic and
ceramic artifacts. The site exhibits low geomorphic integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes and interdunal blowouts. The single FCR feature is moderately disturbed and does not contain datable materials. The small site assemblage contains modest quantities of flaked stone and undecorated ceramics.
This site cannot provide data that is adequate for investigating research issues. For these reasons,
FB 12084 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 14593 (41EP5005)
FB 14593 is a multicomponent site with five thermal features and a low-density artifact scatter. Several
of the features may have deposits that can provide radiocarbon samples, but overall, this heavily disturbed
site has poor geomorphic integrity. A portion of the site was previously tested and recommended eligible
for listing in the NRHP (Baugh et al. 2003). Although the site does contain features with datable materials, there are few spatially associated artifacts, and these are evidently of various ages. This assemblage
offers a limited potential for addressing research issues. For these reasons, FB 14593 is now recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19358 (41EP6246)
FB 19358 is a very small prehistoric site of undetermined temporal affiliation. The site is recognizable in
heavily deflated interdunal areas. It exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. A single highly disturbed stain with ashy fill was identified, with a single chert flake. This site has no appreciable potential
for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19358 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

324

FB 19359 (41EP6247)
FB 19359 is a Formative period site with six thermal features and an associated low-density artifact scatter.
It is situated among coppice dunes that slope down toward a playa located less than 100 m to the east.
Overall, the site exhibits fair geomorphic integrity because of some severely eroded interdunal areas;
yet there are some well preserved features. The single FCR concentration and the five ashy stains contain datable materials with potential for absolute dating, and perhaps for providing macrobotanical samples.
In addition, several of the stains are relatively large and may even be middens or pit structures. The site
assemblage is not large, tallying approximately two dozen artifacts, but does contain a variety of lithic
types spatially associated with undecorated El Paso ceramics. Data from this site could be used to address Formative period research themes, including land use, site structure, seasonal residential use of the
basin, subsistence, and technology. Therefore, FB 19359 is recommended eligible for listing in the
NRHP, under criterion d.

FB 19360 (41EP6248)
FB 19360 is an EarlyâMiddle Formative period campsite consisting of a single thermal feature and a spatially associated low-density artifact scatter. The site, which is situated among low coppice dunes within
interdunal blowouts, exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity. The ashy stain is highly disturbed and
has minimal potential to yield datable materials. The site assemblage contains only a few lithics and ceramics. FB 19360 is too small and too poorly preserved to provide data sufficient for addressing research
issues and is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19361 (41EP6249)
FB 19361 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal and cultural affiliation consisting only of a
single thermal feature. The site has poor geomorphic integrity and is in a location subjected to highly active erosion along the road cut. Although there is some charcoal flecking present in the feature fill, it has
little potential for containing datable materials. Additionally, no artifacts were observed on the site. Therefore, FB 19361 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19362 (41EP6250)
FB 19362 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal and cultural affiliation consisting of a single thermal
feature with no associated artifacts. The rapidly degrading site has low geomorphic integrity, being situated in the middle of a regularly used road. The ashy stain is highly disturbed and has little potential for
retaining datable materials. No artifacts were observed in the area of the feature. This site has no potential
to provide data for investigating research issues. FB 19362 is recommended not eligible for listing in the
NRHP.

FB 19363 (41EP6251)
FB 19363 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation. It consists of a lone thermal feature with no
associated artifacts. The site is situated along the edge of a coppice dune and has a low degree of geomorphic integrity. There is a large interdunal blowout located immediately to the west, and no features or artifacts were observed in this open area. The ashy stain is highly disturbed, with low potential for yielding
datable materials. For these reasons, FB 19363 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
325

FB 19364 (41EP6252)
FB 19364 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single ashy stain. The site
exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes in an interdunal blowout. The ashy stain is highly disturbed and has little potential for yielding datable materials. In addition,
no artifacts were observed in the vicinity of this feature. FB 19364 cannot produce suitable data for investigating research issues and is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19365 (41EP6253)
FB 19365 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single thermal feature and a
flake core. The site exhibits fair geomorphic integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes within an
interdunal blowout. The ashy stain is moderately disturbed, with a limited probability of containing
datable materials. Only a single artifact was recorded near the feature. Therefore, FB 19365 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19366 (41EP6254)
FB 19366 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a thermal feature and a
scraper. The site is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. Geomorphic integrity is
fair. The ashy stain is relatively intact and contains charcoal in ashy fill that could provide material suitable for absolute dating. One artifact was the only item recorded in the area of the feature. FB 9366 cannot provide adequate data for addressing research issues and is recommended not eligible for listing in the
NRHP.

FB 19367 (41EP6294)
FB 19367 is a single outdoor feature that cannot be associated with any other cultural materials. The age
of this feature is unknown. Although fill could be radiocarbon dated, this site cannot provide data to meaningfully address research issues. For this reason, FB 19367 is recommended not eligible for listing in the
NRHP.

FB 19368 (41EP6255)
FB 19368 is a very small Formative period campsite consisting of a thermal feature and a single ceramic
sherd. The site is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout and has fair geomorphic
integrity. The ashy stain is relatively intact and contains material suitable for absolute dating; however,
one brown ware sherd was the only artifact recorded near the feature. This site cannot provide data sufficient for addressing research issues. Consequently, FB 19368 is recommended not eligible for listing
in the NRHP.

FB 19369 (41EP6256)
FB 19369 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. It consists of a single thermal
feature and two flakes. The site exhibits fair geomorphic integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes interspersed by thin sand sheets. The ashy stain is moderately disturbed and has potential for yielding
326

sufficient material for dating. However, only two artifacts were recorded in the area of the feature. This
site cannot provide adequate data for investigating research issues. Therefore, FB 19369 is recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19370 (41EP6257)
FB 19370 is a prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single thermal feature situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. The site has poor geomorphic integrity. The ashy
stain is relatively intact and does contain charcoal flecks that could provide a radiocarbon sample. However, no artifacts were observed in proximity to the feature. This site lacks sufficient cultural materials for
addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19370 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19371 (41EP6258)
FB 19371 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown age and affiliation with a single feature and a flaked stone
artifact. It is situated in a coppice-dune field within extensive interdunal blowouts. The site exhibits fair
geomorphic integrity. The ashy stain is highly disturbed, although there are charcoal flecks in the fill and
it may be a datable feature. A single hammerstone was the only prehistoric artifact recorded near the feature. In addition, a few pieces of SCA glass were identified. FB 19371 cannot provide sufficient data to
address research issues and therefore is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19372 (41EP6259)
FB 19372 is a very small campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. The site, which is situated in a coppice-dune setting and is visible in interdunal areas, has fair geomorphic integrity. A single ashy stain
was identified and evidently could provide radiocarbon samples. However, there are no associated artifacts, rendering this site inadequate to provide data for research issues. Therefore, FB 19372 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19373 (41EP6260)
FB 19373 is a small site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single thermal feature and several
scattered flaked stone artifacts. The site exhibits fair geomorphic integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes
and interdunal blowouts. The ashy stain could provide charcoal sufficient for radiocarbon dating; however,
the associated assemblage consists solely of a few pieces of debitage, offering minimal potential for addressing any research issues. Therefore, FB 19373 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19374 (41EP6261)
FB 19374 consists of a single feature without associated artifacts. It is situated among coppice dunes within
a deflated interdunal blowout. The site has fair geomorphic integrity. The single ashy stain does have the
potential to yield material sufficient for radiocarbon dating; however, there are no associated cultural materials. As FB 19374 cannot provide data adequate for addressing research issues, the site is recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

327

FB 19375 (41EP6262)
FB 19375 includes a thermal feature and a few associated artifacts visible in an interdunal blowout. The
site exhibits good geomorphic integrity. The FCR concentration has the potential to yield sufficient material for radiocarbon dating; however, there are only three artifacts associated with the feature. This small
campsite could provide very little data for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19375 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19376 (41EP6263)
FB 19376 is composed of a single feature of unknown temporal affiliation. The site is situated among
coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout and exhibits good geomorphic integrity. The ashy stain has
the potential to yield datable materials, but no artifacts were observed in the vicinity of the feature. With
only a single feature present and no artifacts, this site cannot provide sufficient data to adequately address
any research issues. For these reasons, FB 19376 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19377 (41EP6264)
FB 19377 is a small site of unknown temporal affiliation situated on a slightly elevated position on a coppice dune. It exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. The site has simply one severely disturbed,
ashy stain exposed in the road. No artifacts were observed in the area of the feature. The feature evidently
could provide a radiocarbon sample, but this site cannot provide suitable data for investigating research
issues. Therefore, FB 19377 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19378 (41EP6265)
FB 19378 consists of a single feature of unknown temporal affiliation. The site exhibits low geomorphic
integrity; it is situated in a coppice-dune setting on a slight rise overlooking a playa. There is a moderately
disturbed, ashy stain with fill containing some ash and charcoal flecking. It is not certain that the feature could provide sufficient material for radiocarbon dating. No artifacts were observed in the vicinity of
the feature. This site cannot provide data suitable for addressing research issues; therefore, FB 19378 is
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19379 (41EP6266)
FB 19379 consists of a single feature of unknown temporal affiliation. The site, which is situated among
coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout, exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. The feature
is a highly disturbed, ashy stain with uncertain potential for yielding sufficient final carbon for radiocarbon dating. In addition, no artifacts were observed in the vicinity of the feature. This site lacks sufficient cultural materials for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19379 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19380 (41EP6267)
FB 19380 consists of a single feature and a low-density FCR scatter of unknown temporal affiliation. The
site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal
328

blowout. The ashy stain is moderately disturbed and contains uncertain potential for yielding materials for
radiocarbon dating. No artifacts were observed in the vicinity of the feature. As FB 19380 cannot provide
data to effectively address research issues, it is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19381 (41EP6268)
FB 19381 consists of two features with a small assemblage of artifacts. The site exhibits a low degree of
geomorphic integrity, being within an interdunal blowout among coppice dunes. However, the two features are ashy stains with fill that could yield materials for radiocarbon dating. The site assemblage is
small, including only a few lithic and ceramic artifacts. The presence of a single El Paso Polychrome
sherd suggests a Late Formative occupation. Overall, the assemblage has little potential for addressing
research issues, especially given the poor context of these artifacts. Therefore, FB 19381 is recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19382 (41EP6269)
FB 19382 is a small campsite of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single feature and artifact.
The site exhibits fair geomorphic integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes in an interdunal blowout.
The ashy stain contains fill that could yield materials suitable for radiocarbon dating. However, there is
only an isolated piece of debitage associated with the feature, and this site cannot provide data for
addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19382 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19383 (41EP6295)
FB 19383 is a small site of unknown age that has one small outdoor feature and one spatially associated
flake. Site integrity is fair, and the feature fill evidently could be radiocarbon dated. However, this site
lacks adequate materials for addressing research issues. Consequently, FB 19383 is recommended not
eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19384 (41EP6270)
FB 19384 is a multicomponent campsite with one feature and an associated artifact scatter. The site exhibits a high degree of geomorphic integrity. It is situated in a coppice-dune setting within an interdunal
blowout. The ashy stain is intact and could provide materials for radiocarbon dating. Although the artifact
assemblage is small, it does contain a variety of lithic artifact types, including a Late Archaic projectile point.
In addition, several brown ware sherds were identified. Nonetheless, the potential for these artifacts to
yield information for addressing research issues is limited, because of the paucity of items and the mixture of Archaic and Formative occupations. Therefore, FB 19384 is recommended not eligible for listing
in the NRHP.

FB 19385 (41EP6296)
FB 19385 is a small site of unknown age that includes one feature and two stone artifacts. The site has
poor geomorphic integrity. Fill from the feature at this site could be radiocarbon dated, but this would not
provide results that could be effectively used to address research issues. As this site cannot provide data
adequate for addressing research issues, it is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
329

FB 19386 (41EP6271)
FB 19386 is a small prehistoric campsite composed of a single feature of unknown age and affiliation.
The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. It is situated in a coppice-dune setting within an
interdunal blowout. The ashy stain is moderately disturbed but may contain sufficient charcoal for radiocarbon dating. No artifacts were identified near the feature. Therefore, FB 19386 cannot provide sufficient
data for addressing research issues and is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19387 (41EP6297)
FB 19387 is small site that includes one feature and four associated cans. The site probably dates from the
first half of the twentieth century. Site integrity is poor, and there is realistically no additional information
to be obtained from this site. FB 19387 cannot provide data for addressing research issues and is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19388 (41EP6272)
FB 19388 consists of a multicomponent Formative period artifact scatter. The site exhibits a low degree
of geomorphic integrity, being situated in a coppice-dune setting within several interdunal blowouts. The
majority of the assemblage is composed of ceramics, including El Paso Brown and brownware sherds. A
single El Paso Polychrome sherd attests to a Late Formative presence. In total, there are few artifacts that
could provide data necessary for addressing research issues. The site lacks contextual integrity, and
there is no potential for chronometric dating. Therefore, FB 19388 is recommended not eligible for
listing in the NRHP.

FB 19389 (41EP6273)
FB 19389 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. The site exhibits a low degree
of geometric integrity. It is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. An intact, ashy
stain was recorded and has the potential to yield materials suitable for radiocarbon dating. However, a
single flake about 20 m from the feature was the only artifact observed. As FB 19389 cannot provide adequate data for addressing research issues, the site is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19390 (41EP6274)
FB 19390 is a Formative period site composed of a single feature and an associated artifact scatter that
contains lithics and ceramics. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity, being situated
within several interdunal blowouts. The single FCR/burned-caliche feature lacks intact deposits and the
potential to yield datable materials. A moderately dense artifact scatter is present, containing a diverse
assemblage of flaked stone and ground stone, with some El Paso brownware. Although this assemblage
might provide sufficient data to address research questions, it cannot be placed within an absolute
temporal context. Therefore, FB 19390 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

330

FB 19391 (41EP6275)
FB 19391 is a small Late Formative period campsite consisting of a light scatter of artifacts. The site
exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity. Artifacts are visible within interdunal blowouts between
coppice dunes. No features were observed, and no datable deposits were evident. The few identified
artifacts do not have the potential to yield sufficient information for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19391 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19392 (41EP6276)
FB 19392 is a low-density Formative period artifact scatter. The site exhibits a high degree of geomorphic
integrity, although it is situated in a coppice-dune setting within interdunal blowouts. This site cannot be
absolutely dated, because of the absence of features. The few artifacts that were located cannot yield sufficient information for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19392 is recommended not eligible for
listing in the NRHP.

FB 19393 (41EP6277)
FB 19393 is a small campsite of unknown temporal affiliation. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity and is situated in a coppice-dune setting within interdunal blowouts. Three ashy stains were
recorded. The features are in varying states of preservation, but two of them have observable charcoal
flecking. No artifacts were observed in association with the features. Although the features do have the
potential to yield datable materials, the lack of artifacts restricts the data potential of the site. Therefore,
FB 19393 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19394 (41EP6278)
FB 19394 is a prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation situated in a coppice-dune setting
with extensive interdunal blowouts. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. The single
feature is a highly disturbed, ashy stain that may be datable. No artifacts are present; in sum, this site
lacks the data potential to address research issues. For these reasons, FB 19394 is recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19395 (41EP6298)
FB 19395 includes two small stains in the north part of the site and a modest quantity of nearby artifacts.
The plain sherds are in the same stratigraphic context as the two features, and contemporaneity is possible,
although unproved. Fill from both features contains charcoal; these features have the potential to be radiocarbon dated. In spite of this potential, the site cannot provide adequate data for effectively addressing research issues without charcoal fragments large enough to investigate research issues related to subsistence
and with no additional cultural materials, other than a dispersed smattering of artifacts. FB 19395 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

331

FB 19396 (41EP6299)
FB 19396 is an undated site composed of two small features and a few artifacts. Fill from one of the
features may be possible to radiocarbon date. The site retains no more than fair geomorphic integrity.
With only two small, somewhat eroded features and a total of four artifacts, this site cannot produce
adequate data for investigating research issues. As a result, FB 19396 is recommended not eligible for
listing in the NRHP.

FB 19397 (41EP6279)
FB 19397 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown age and affiliation. The site exhibits a fair degree of
geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within an interdunal blowout. One of the two
features at this site, an ashy stain, is relatively intact and has the potential to yield datable materials. However, there are too few artifacts to address research issues. Therefore, FB 19397 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19398 (41EP6280)
FB 19398 is a campsite of unknown temporal affiliation that consists of several features and a single artifact. The site exhibits a high degree of geomorphic integrity. The features are preserved in an interdunal
blowout in coppice-dune terrain. The one artifact, a biface, is in an adjacent interdunal area. The three
features are poorly preserved, ashy stains. FB 19398 has limited potential to provide data for addressing
research issues and is therefore recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19399 (41EP6281)
FB 19399 is an undated prehistoric campsite that consists of a single feature within an interdunal blowout
among coppice dunes. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. The one feature at this site
is a poorly preserved, ashy stain. Although there is some charcoal flecking in the fill, this feature may be
too disturbed to provide a radiocarbon sample. No artifacts were observed in the area of the feature. This
site cannot provide sufficient data for pursuing research issues. Therefore, FB 19399 is recommended not
eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19400 (41EP6300)
FB 19400 includes one feature with deposits that possibly could be radiocarbon dated. Without associated
cultural materials, a date alone could not be used to address research issues. There are no other archaeological materials with which this feature can be associated. Therefore, FB 19400 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19403 (41EP6282)
FB 19403 is a small, low-density Formative period artifact scatter that contains flaked stone and ceramics.
This site, which is situated among coppice dunes in an interdunal blowout, exhibits fair geomorphic integrity. Although no features were observed at the site, a dispersed scatter of flaked stone and ceramic artifacts
332

was recorded. These artifacts cannot be placed in a temporal context and cannot provide appreciable data for
addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19403 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19404 (41EP6283)
FB 19404 is a Formative period campsite that consists of several features and an associated low-density
artifact scatter. The site exhibits fair geomorphic integrity. Cultural materials are exposed in interdunal
blowouts in coppice-dune terrain. The three highly disturbed FCR concentrations and single ashy stain
contain uncertain potential for yielding adequate samples for radiocarbon dating, because of heavy disturbance. The small artifact assemblage cannot provide robust data for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19404 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19406 (41EP6284)
FB 19406 is a Late Formative period campsite composed of a low-density artifact scatter visible in
interdunal blowouts among coppice dunes. The site exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity. No
features were observed, and absolute dating is not possible. The small size of the artifact assemblage
restricts the data potential for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19406 is recommended not
eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19407 (41EP6285)
FB 19407 is a small campsite of unknown temporal affiliation with a single feature exposed in an interdunal blowout. The site exhibits a fair degree of geomorphic integrity. One highly disturbed, ashy stain
with uncertain potential to provide a radiocarbon sample was recorded. Charcoal flecks were present, but
the feature is badly disturbed. For these reasons, FB 19407 is recommended not eligible for listing in the
NRHP.

FB 19408 (41EP6286)
FB 19408 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of a single feature
and one flake. This site is located near the margin of a small playa in an interdunal exposure. The ashy
stain may contain sufficient charcoal for radiocarbon dating but is highly disturbed. The single flake cannot provide information for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19408 is recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19409 (41EP6287)
FB 19409 is a small prehistoric campsite of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of two thermal features and a low-density artifact scatter. The site has fair geomorphic integrity and is situated among coppice dunes within interdunal blowouts. One FCR/burned-caliche concentration is highly disturbed. The
second feature, which is moderately disturbed, could provide charcoal for radiocarbon dating. Too few
artifacts are present to provide effective samples for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19409 is
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

333

FB 19410 (41EP6288)
FB 19410 is a small Late Formative period campsite with one roasting feature and an associated low-density artifact scatter. Feature deposits contain charcoal, although obtaining a date from this feature is impractical, as there are so few associated artifacts. FB 19410 cannot provide sufficient data for addressing
research questions and is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19411 (41EP6289)
FB 19411 is a small Late Formative period logistical site composed of a low-density artifact scatter. This
site is visible in interdunal exposures. No features or datable materials were observed, and there is no potential for absolute dating of this site. The assemblage contains only a few lithic and ceramic artifacts;
these cannot contribute be used to effectively address any research issues. Therefore, FB 19411 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19412 (41EP6290)
FB 19412 is a campsite of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of one feature, scattered FCR, and two
pieces of ground stone. The moderately disturbed FCR/caliche concentration retains deposits with charcoal and ash. However, this feature and the two pieces of associated ground stone would provide little data
for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19412 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19413 (41EP6291)
FB 19413 is small prehistoric site of unknown temporal affiliation consisting of three thermal features
and a light scatter of FCR exposed within interdunal blowouts. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. The three ashy stains are moderately to highly disturbed but do contain some bits of charcoal. It may be possible to obtain radiocarbon dates for the features at this site, but no artifacts were observed in the area of the features. As FB 19413 cannot provide sufficient data for addressing research
issues, the site is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19414 (41EP6292)
FB 19414 is a Formative period campsite with two thermal features and an associated artifact scatter.
These features and artifacts are visible in interdunal exposures where Q3 horizons are partially preserved. The site exhibits a low degree of geomorphic integrity. The two ashy stains are small and highly
disturbed, with little potential for yielding datable materials. The artifact assemblage is too small to provide data for effectively addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19414 is recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP.

FB 19415 (41EP6293)
FB 19415 is a Late Formative period campsite that consists of a thermal feature with an associated lithicand ceramic-artifact scatter. The site is situated among low coppice dunes within interdunal blowouts and
exhibits fair geomorphic integrity. The single FCR concentration has been highly disturbed by erosion and
contains no datable deposits. In addition, the artifact assemblage contains few items and has low diversity
334

and little potential for addressing research issues. Therefore, FB 19415 is recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP.

CHAPTER 11

Conclusions
A. C. MacWilliams

There are 99 archaeological sites in the project area. Of these, 44 are sites that were previously recorded.
Of these 99 sites, 19 are recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP and the remaining 80 are recommended not eligible.

Large Sites and Small Sites
2

The 99 sites vary in scale more than they vary in structure. Sites range from about 1,100 to over 800,000 m
in area (with buffers included); yet the structural characteristics of the largest and smallest sites are much
alike. Typically, sites have carbon-stained fill or FCR/burned-caliche concentrations with modest quantities of flaked stone, ground stone, and ceramics. On existing evidence, no more than a handful of these
sites may include structures.
2
Larger sites (arbitrarily defined as exceeding 10,000 m ) are indicative of more-extensively used areas,
so much as more-intensively used areas. Three factors may explain the preferred locations inferred from
the distributions of features and artifacts. The first is topography and landforms. The net topographic relief in the project area is approximately 15 m. The highest areas are linear rises that parallel and overlook
drainages and small playas located in the downthrown fault blocks. Archaeological remains are more extensive on the higher areas, as discussed in Chapter 8. The fault troughs (explained in Chapter 3) form
playas that become seasonal magnets as they fill with rain and are intermittently the sole sources of water
in the basin floor. During wet intervals, these locations may have been exploited from camps located
above wet ground.
The second reason for not interpreting larger sites simply as aggregations of smaller sites is heterogeneous resource availability. Vegetation, and therefore resource-availability, disparities exist today at the
scale of topographic settings in the basin and potentially existed throughout the Holocene period. It has
proven difficult to fully determine what resources were processed in roasting pits and outdoor hearths in
this region (Toll and McBride 2005). However, succulents and members of the lily family are likely to
have been among the important resources. The land has been heavily disturbed for more than one century,
and small-scale, modern vegetation patterns are of limited value for relating plant-resource availability to
settlement resulting in the accretionary formation of larger sites. In fact, examining the distribution of features and knowing their contents might be the most-informative means of assessing past plant distributions.
Lastly, there potentially is a preservation bias that complements these other reasons. The larger sites,
which reflect more-extensive use of preferred settings, may also be located in areas where Q3 deposits
(ca. 100â7300 B.P.) are best preserved. These are the deposits that contain Archaic and Formative period
features and that may contain some more-recent, post-Contact features related to the Mansos or other groups.

337

Settlement in the Hueco Bolson
Prehistoric settlement in the Hueco Bolson has been the subject of several valuable discussions (see Carmichael 1986; Mauldin et al. 1998; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Whalen 1978). The consensus model of
settlement is that the lower basin of the Hueco Bolson, which excludes the flanking alluvial fans, was exploited by small, highly mobile groups during the Archaic period, with a Formative period trend toward
increasing logistical use of the basin and toward overall reduced use of the basin away from major playas
during the El Paso phase.
An obvious implication of this settlement trend for the interpretation of larger sites in the Hueco Bolson is that components of differing ages may indicate similar activities that occurred within dissimilar
overall settlement, subsistence, and mobility strategies. The important, yet finite, resource base of the
Hueco Bolson makes it likely that primary activities in the project area, irrespective of age, were plant
gathering and processing, hunting, and acquiring mineral resourcesâand certainly stone flaking and perhaps pottery production. Viable resources through much of the Holocene period likely included grass
seeds, succulents, members of the lily family, a variety of game, and a rich variety of rock types, including chert, quartzite, rhyolite, and obsidian. These lithologies are in gravels deposited by the Rio Grande
before the early Pleistocene channel shifted west of the Franklin Mountains. Over 300 pieces of worked
obsidian were recorded during this project, giving some indication of the value of these gravels for providing workable stone.
Sites or components ascribed to the Archaic period during this project were recognized as such by the
presence of varieties of dart points known to date from that interval. Archaic period points were identified
at nine sites and at almost one dozen isolated finds. Archaic period occupations have also been recognized
during previous projects involving several of these sites (Foster 1993; Renn et al. 2008; Sale 2007). These
Archaic period sites or site components are the residue of mobile people that mapped onto resources in what
probably was a fluid settlement system with elements of both foraging and gathering adaptations. Condon
et al. (2008:39) characterized Archaic period basin settlement as highly mobile, with residential-oriented
foraging groups that exploited the resources during the spring, summer, and fall. Hunter-gatherers probably stayed out of the basin during cold, dry winters, when few resources and little to no water would have
been available (Carmichael 1986). Mauldin (2007:51) described the basin as an environment entirely dependent on precipitation, which is unpredictable and also patchy. The low-density, extensive Archaic period presence indicated by this project is consistent with these interpretations of Archaic period settlement,
particularly in the context of Whalenâs (1994b) assessment that people would have survived in small, dispersed groups in the basin.
The Late Archaic and Formative periods drifted toward increasing sedentism and culminated in an agriculturalist adaptation that lasted several centuries and ended approximately A.D. 1450. Largely because
of agriculture, use of the interior basin may have been increasingly logistical by the Middle to Late Formative period, although Whalen (1994b) reasoned that there were not substantial differences between the
Late Archaic period and the ensuing Mesilla phase. In fact, it was before A.D. 650 that interior-basin âthermal featuresâ were most abundant (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:246). Within the scope of this project, Formative period nonhabitation sites may have been locations where the same resources were exploited in
much the same manner as they have been for many centuries, but by logistical task groups rather than
highly mobile family units. Maximum use of the interior of the basin coincided with the Early and Middle
Formative periods. Miller and Kenmotsu (2004:247) recognized that there are fewer postâA.D. 1000 structures and hearths in the central basin, and especially so after A.D. 1275. The reason given for this settlement shift is increasing logistical use of the basin. This shift coincided with increased agriculturalism at
the bases of alluvial fans flanking the lower Hueco Bolson (Condon et al. 2007:229; Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:45). There is extensive Formative period archaeology involving at least 43 of the 99 sites that were
recorded.
There are several El Paso phase pueblos located within the basin, a short distance to the west of the
5,000-acre survey area (see Dering et al, 2001; Lowry 2005; Whalen 1978). These pueblos may be the
338

complementary residences for El Paso phase logistical locations evidenced by hundreds of El Paso Polychrome sherds throughout the current project area. The relative abundance of nearby El Paso phase habitation sites notwithstanding, this part of the basin seems like an improbable locale for intensive subsistence farming, other than around larger fault-trough playas.
It is appropriate to consider in broad, collective terms what data the sites recommended eligible for
listing in the NRHP could provide to advance the prevailing models of southern Jornada Mogollon settlement patterns, resource use, and mobility. Chapters 7 and 10 identify how individual sites may inform
research issues. With additional chronological data, and particularly radiocarbon dates, recognition of settlement patterns could be refined and perhaps more-precisely related to topographic settings of sites. There
is potential to link settlement and landscape useâat a finer scale of resolution, one involving specific topographic settings, such as the low ridges and fault-trough basinsâwith expanded chronological data. As
discussed above, hearths and roasting pits were most abundant before A.D. 650 in the Hueco Bolson. Yet
there was an extensive El Paso phase presence throughout the 5,000-acre area, as indicated by El Paso
Polychrome, although the ceramics are not uniformly distributed across the landscape (as discussed in
Chapter 8). Several sites that have been recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP have El Paso phase
ceramics. Whether or not these sites also have El Paso phase features is presently unknown. These larger
sites are concatenations of many occupation events, and proximity of artifacts and features does not ensure temporal association, particularly in an actively eroding landscape. However, attempting to better understand this issue could contribute to an improved understanding of basin adaptation during the El Paso
phase. Many of the features located during this project have charcoal and not only the potential to provide
absolute dates but also data about plant use, via macrobotanical analyses. Recognized changes in how this
area of the basin was used around the beginning of the El Paso phase may be proven to coincide with
changes in wild-plant exploitation, if in fact some El Paso phase features are identified at sites recommended
eligible for listing in the NRHP.
