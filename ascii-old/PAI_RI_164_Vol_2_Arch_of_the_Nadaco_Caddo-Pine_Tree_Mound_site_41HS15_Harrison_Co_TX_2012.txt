Appendix A: Human Remains
INTRODUCTION

Titus phase sites with human remains include
Tuck Carpenter, Alex Justiss, and the H. R.
Taylor Farm. Although the analyzed samples
are small and poorly preserved, Burnett (1990,
1999) suggests two biocultural factors that
contrast Titus phase remains with other Caddo
data. She notes a low rate of infection, which
contrasts with Wilsonâs (1998) findings for the
Caddo region as a whole. Of the 13 adults and
1 subadult in Burnettâs (1990, 1999) synthesis
of the Cypress and upper Sabine drainages,
none exhibited infection. In her synthesis of
the middle Sabine drainage, she lists infection
in 1 of the 6 adults and 1 of the 3 subadults.
The other hypothesis Burnett (1990, 1999) puts
forth is that the Caddo of the Sabine basin did
not depend on maize agriculture and that maize
carbohydrate consumption was low. She bases
this on a low frequency of dental caries and a
lack of porotic hyperostosis. As discussed below,
the human remains from 41HS15 can be used
to test only the latter hypothesis.
Presented in the following pages is a
biological assessment of the human remains
from the Pine Tree Mound site. This includes
an inventory of the remains, discrete traits on
bones and teeth, measurements on bones and
teeth, taphonomic impacts, and paleopathology.

This appendix provides an analysis of
human remains excavated in 2006 and early
2007 from the Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15)
in Harrison County, Texas, by Prewitt and
Associates, Inc. The Pine Tree Mound site is
affiliated with the Caddo culture, and, based
on archeological context, the analyzed human
remains are from the Late Caddo period. Health,
or adaptive success, is the result of complex
interweaving of culture, diet, environment, and
genetics. This study reports on the adaptive
success of the Caddo from the Pine Tree Mound
site in relation to other Caddo archeological
populations.
The Pine Tree Mound site lies within the
middle Sabine River drainage in the Caddo
culture region in Texas. The middle Sabine
drainage basin contains populations from the
larger of two identified archeological Caddo
genetic groups (Lee 1999) and lies mostly in the
Pine Forest biotic zone. The two small cemeteries
and isolated burials excavated in Areas 2 and
8 at 41HS15 represent a settlement that is
comparable in age, as well as other respects,
to the Caddo Titus phase, which is centered
on the Cypress Creek basin to the north and
northwest but laps over into parts of the
Sabine drainage. To date, the majority of Titus
phase burials come from relatively egalitarian
cemeteries, with few sites exhibiting status
differentiation among burials. The inhabitants
of the middle Sabine drainage basin have been
characterized as being a relatively classless
segment of the Caddo culture who did not
consume maize in large quantities, had a low
rate of infection and pathogen load, and were
genetically homogenous. Given the presence
of a large civic-ceremonial center at the Pine
Tree Mound site and the quantity and quality
of grave goods found, it is important to compare
the demography and adaptive success of those
buried in Areas 2 and 8 with individuals from
other Late Caddo sites to discern how status
affected health in a Caddo community.
The Sabine River basin and the Titus
phase in particular are poorly documented
bioarcheologically. This is due in large part
to the poor preservation of skeletal remains
in the region. None of the sites with human
remains are particularly well known, with the
possible exception of the Tuck Carpenter site.

INVENTORY
Establishing an inventory of the individuals
recovered is a prerequisite to an osteological
analysis. The inventory serves as a description
of remains present and is useful in assessments
of preservation, mortuary practices, postmortem
disturbances, excavation conditions, and
techniques. It also describes the limits on the
scope of analyses of human remains.
In general, preservation of the human
remains was poor, with 11 of 27 graves containing
bone and 3 others with only enamel (1 of
these, consisting of fragmented tooth enamel
from Feature 2.2080, was too deteriorated for
meaningful analysis). Determining the actual
number of burials at the site is somewhat
problematic due to poor preservation, including
a complete lack of bones in many cases. Of the
14 graves reported on here, 1 contained the
remains of two individuals, while the others
were all single interments. The double burial
was found in Area 8 and designated Feature
8.1085. Evidence suggests that a similar
695

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
double interment in Area 2 was present but not
preserved.
Although there were 16 graves in Area 2,
only 5 individuals were preserved at all. In Area
8, 9 of the 11 graves contained the remains of
10 individuals. Rose and Burnett (1999) found
an average of 8.7 individuals per occupational
unit for sites in the eastern portion of the Gulf
Coastal Plain. These sites were predominately
Caddo. Rose and Burnett (1999) divided the
study into river basins; with the Sabine having a
mean of 5.7 individuals per mortuary component
within a site. If we assume a minimum burial
population of 29 from Areas 2 and 8, there was
a significantly higher site population average
than the mean figures for the eastern portion
of the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Sabine River
basin. Given that the population at the Pine
Tree Mound site consisted of sedentary intensive
maize horticulturalists, their population would
be expected to be larger than those of their
predecessor hunter-gatherers and the period
postdating occupation of 41HS15, which Rose
and Burnett (1999) termed âDisintegration
and Reintegration of Historic Indian Groups.â
Estimating the size of a living population from
inventory data can be a perplexing problem due
to the myriad of factors that influence the size
of a burial population, excavation strategy and
preservation being just two of these.

descriptions of preservation so that, although
purely descriptive, at least there is some
minimal understanding of the state of surface
destruction of bone acknowledged in a report
(Wilson and Steele 1996, 1997). Others have
chosen to omit individual descriptions (Burnett
1990, 1999).
The analysis presented here attempts to
provide a more-objective assessment of the state
of preservation. Table A.1 provides a summary
of the elements recovered from the Pine Tree
Mound site and degree of completeness. The
table shows that the majority of skeletal
elements were incomplete and that in all burials
some bones were not preserved at all. What the
table does not show is that 13 graves (of 27) were
completely without bone remains. Additionally,
there were numerous bones identified in the
field based on anatomical position that were
too fragmentary to confirm in the laboratory
during the data collection phase of this project.
The skeletal preservation observed is typical
for interments in soil where thicker cortical
bone is more often preserved than thinner and
cancellous bones. In the cranium, facial bones
were less common and more fragmentary than
cranial vault bones, and in the postcranium,
long bones were more common and recovered
in larger fragments than bones of the chest,
back, pelvis, hands, and feet. None of the lower
vertebrae, sternums, parts of the pelvis, patellas,
and phalanges were recovered.
Table A.2 provides information on the
completeness of each analyzed skeleton
(defined as an individual represented by
skeletal remains). Preservation was assessed
by representation (presence/absence) out of
the total number of possible elements, and
estimates of completeness for each of the bones
were scored in accordance with Buikstra and
Ubelacker (1994). Both of these values indicate
that human remains are poorly preserved with
skeletal element representation only as high
as 30 percent and completeness only as high as
17 percent. Looking at the site mean of 3 percent
complete, preservation is worse at the Pine Tree
Mound site than at sites in the Cooper Lake
region, which ranged from 10 to 45 percent
(Wilson and Steele 1997).
The completeness of the long bones of the
arm and leg also was examined (Table A.3).
These bones are the thickest and generally
best-preserved postcranial material. The site

TAPHONOMY
Taphonomic analyses of human skeletal
remains recovered from sites have rarely been
addressed in a systematic fashion, if addressed
at all. The issues most commonly raised when
evaluating the taphonomic processes affecting
human remains deal with documenting the
extent of postmortem loss and degradation of
skeletal remains; understanding the processes of
destruction and dispersal of bone; and assessing
the role of humans as agents in causing the
modification, destruction, and dispersal of
human skeletal remains at archeological sites.
Documenting taphonomic processes, like the
inventory, indicates what kinds of information
a skeletal series can provide.
Poor preservation is generally acknowledged
and inferred throughout the southern Caddo
archeological region in Texas but seldom
described analytically. Some summary volumes
have attempted to include prior researchersâ

Notes: Skeletal representation is based on the presence of up to 87 skeletal elements inventoried. Elements were
recorded as to the presence of up to 156 observations based on side, portion of element, and landmarks present.
Representation is scored as presence or absence. For example, Feature 8.1092 has 25 skeletal elements
represented out of a possible 156 inventoried, for a skeletal representation of 16%. Skeletal completeness is
based on observed preservation recorded on a scale of 0â3 following procedures outlined in Buikstra and
Ubelaker (1994): 1 = minimally 67% complete; 2 = minimally 33% complete; and 1 = minimally 1% complete.
For example, in Feature 8.1092 there are five scores of 2 and nine scores of 3, for a raw total of 174
([5x33]+[9x1]); to calculate minimum completeness, the raw total is divided by the score for a hypothetically
complete skeleton (156x0.67). Both representation and completeness scores exclude dental remains.

condition of the bones, along with their low
organic content, can be attributed to acidic soil.
In addition, the soil is relatively fine-grained,
which leads to a slow percolation rate so that
repeated wetting and slow drying further

means confirm that preservation even for the
best-preserved bones in the human body is poor
at the Pine Tree Mound site.
As in much of the southern Caddo
archeological region, the dry and brittle

process in the region.

from the population. Values presented in
Burnettâs (1990, 1999) summary studies are 35
years in the Sabine River drainage, 34 years in
the Trinity River basin, 37 years in the Neches
basin, 31.8 years in the Cypress Creek and
upper Sabine basins, 30.8 years in the Sulphur
River drainage, and 35.3 years in the Red River
drainage. Wilson (1997) reports average ages at
death for adults of 35.8 and 38.3 years at the
mound sites of Sanders and Mitchell. The data
from Cooper Lake (Wilson and Steele 1997)
suggest that social status is not a factor in the
high mean age at death seen in the Pine Tree
Mound population, since the adult mean age
at death for Cooper Lake is calculated to have
been 44.6 years.
Where demographic data have been
provided, males appear to have outlived females
throughout the Texas Caddo region. Based
upon the individuals for whom sex could be
determined, males had a significantly higher
average age at death at 42.7 years than females
at 33.2 years. If the subadult female is removed,
the adult female average age at death is closer
to the male average at 38.6 years. A significant
difference between male and female average
age of death was also found in the Cooper Lake
population, with males averaging 46.6 years
compared to 38.4 for females (Wilson and Steele
1997). This is the same pattern recorded for
the Sanders (38.5 and 35.6 years) and Mitchell
(38.3 and 35.6 years) populations (Wilson 1997).
The higher age at death for males is common
historically and is assumed to be a reflection of
higher mortality of adolescent and young adult
females due to complications of pregnancy and
childbirth.
The adult sex ratio exclusive of individuals
for whom sex could not be determined is four
females to five males. Throughout the southern
Caddo region in Texas, there is a nearly even sex
ratio (Table A.5). Rose (1984) suggests that a sex
ratio of more males than females is the norm
for Caddo sites, but data presented in Table A.5
contradict this hypothesis.

DEMOGRAPHY
Sex and age of the individuals from the Pine
Tree Mound site were determined using a variety
of techniques. Aging techniques included an
examination of dental formation stage (Moorees
et al. 1963a, 1963b); dental eruption (Ubelaker
1978); dental wear compared to Texas Red River
Caddo (Wilson 1997); external, incisive, and
internal cranial vault suture closure (Buikstra
and Ubelaker 1994; Meindl and Lovejoy 1985);
epiphyseal fusion (Baker et al. 2005); and size
and features of immature remains (Baker et al.
2005). Sex was determined using one or more of
the following techniques: cranial observations
(Krogman 1962; Steele and Bramblett 1988),
femoral midshaft circumference (Black 1978),
and dental discriminant function formulas (Ditch
and Rose 1972). Table A.4 provides a summary of
age and sex data for the Pine Tree Mound human
remains. The average age at death for the site is
29.6. This is nearly the same as for sites in the
Cooper Lake region at 29.1 years (Wilson and
Steele 1997), and it is similar to the Mitchell site
but higher than the Hatchel site, both on the Red
River (Lee 1997:163). The Pine Tree Mound site is
close to the mean for the summary data from the
middle Sabine basin at 28.3 years as presented
by Burnett (1990, 1999). When compared to
Burnettâs (1990, 1999) other summary data, the
Pine Tree Mound average age at death is similar
to those for the Little River drainage (29.7) and
the Neches River (29.0), while it is higher than
those for the Red River drainage (20.4), Sulphur
River drainage (26.6), and Cypress Creek and
upper Sabine basins (22.0) and lower than the
value for the Wylie focus of the East Fork of
the Trinity River (32.9). It is interesting to note
that the Pine Tree Mound population fits into
a general south-to-southwest progression of
increasing age at death through the Caddo region
in Texas, which may be the result of differential
burial practices or preservation of subadults or
a real increase in longevity.
The average age at death for adults at the
Pine Tree Mound site is high at 41.1 years. This
is higher than all other comparable data and
suggests a relative absence of young adults

in the few measurements that could be taken. It
was not possible to estimate stature for any of
the individuals, and postcranial measurements
could be obtained only from one individual,
Feature 2.186, a female. It was therefore not
possible to assess sexual dimorphism within
the site population. Doran (1975) found Caddo
stature in the mid-range of what is considered
normal for human sexual dimorphism by Stini
(1985). Wilson and Steele (1997) found that
individuals from Cooper Lake were consistent
with Doranâs findings on Caddo stature and
were near the upper limit of the normal range
for robusticity. This suggests that sexual
dimorphism among the Caddo was reflected

more in terms of robusticity (thickness of bones,
muscle attachment sites, etc.) than stature.
Unfortunately the Pine Tree Mound data
cannot provide additional information to test
this hypothesis. Looking at the circumference
at nutrient foramen of the tibia, there is a clear
division in size between females and males in
the Cooper Lake population (Wilson and Steele
1997). The female from Feature 2.186 at Pine
Tree Mound falls well within the measurements
of females from Cooper Lake. In terms of cranial
measurements, it was possible to get some
measurements on two females and two males,
and a difference in size is suggested by the few
measurements taken (see Table A.8).

POPULATION AFFINITIES

fits this pattern, but too little data could be
collected to permit a valid statistical analysis.
Nonmetric traits were recorded using the
Texas A&M University scoring system (Steele
et al. 1993), while dental traits were scored
using the abbreviated Arizona State University
(ASU) system recommended by Buikstra and
Ubelacker (1994). Dental traits were scored
using ASU reference plaques. Nonmetric cranial
and postcranial traits are presented in Table
A.9 and dental traits are given in Table A.10.
Skeletal traits could only be observed on five
individuals, while dental traits were observed
on nine individuals.
In comparing the visible traits to those
reported by Lee (1999) for her Middle Caddo
period, 4 of the 22 traits may differ from the
southern Caddo Texas pattern. The majority
therefore indicate concurrence with Leeâs (1999)
findings that the population in this region
was homogenous. Lambdoid ossicles were
absent in the two individuals from the Pine

Population affinity for the Caddo is an
important topic given their geographic location
between Plains and Mississippian populations
and Texas hunter-gatherer populations. The
Caddo spoke a Plains language but were
culturally similar to Mississippian populations.
To date, the most thorough study is that by Lee
(1999) showing that the Caddo were a genetically
homogenous group with admixture concentrated
in the Red River valley between a.d. 1200 and
1600 and limited both before and after this time
period. The Pine Tree Mound site dates to the
time period of greatest population admixture but
is outside the geographic region of heterogeneity.
Lee (1999) found that populations within the
drainages of the Angelina, Neches, and Neosho
Rivers and Cypress Creek were closely related
with a possible closer link to the upper Red
River than lower Red River populations. The
population from the Pine Tree Mound generally

The mental foramen was present in the one

Texas and relatively rare in all other Caddo
populations included in Leeâs (1999) study.

57 percent of the individuals for whom the trait
could be scored (Lee 1999).
Dental data were less comparable. Only
10 of the traits scored for in this study were
considered significant by Lee (1999). Again,
the majority of trait scores fit with Leeâs (1999)
data and indicate that the Pine Tree Mound
population was congruous with the Caddo
living in Texas south and west of the Red
River during her Middle Caddo period. Two
traits do not follow her pattern, but the small
number of observations makes their import
dubious. Double shoveling was absent in the
two individuals who could be scored for central
incisors, but Lee (1999) finds this trait common
in all Caddo regions but the Ouachita, where it
was present in only 15 percent of the population.

Similarly, the protostylid on the mandibular
first molars is absent in the Pine Tree Mound
population but ubiquitous in all but the Ouachita
population, where it occurred in 39 percent of
the population (Lee 1999). While the sample
size is far too small to be conclusive, the genetic
traits indicate that there was either population
admixture with Caddo from the Ouachita River
region or that the differences in the Pine Tree
Mound population compared to other Caddo
regions reflect genetic drift described by Lee
(1999) from some of the large mound centers.
Leeâs (1999) hypothesis that biological distance
among the Caddo was more affected by social
status than geography appears to be upheld at
the Pine Tree Mound site, where grave goods
indicate relatively high status for some burials.

DIET

rate of which is influenced by the amount of
unprocessed vegetal materials and grit in the
diet. Grit is introduced into the diet through
associations of dietary items and sand and the use
of stone grinding implements. The Caddo used
both stone and wooden grinding implements.
Dental wear can also result in the introduction
of infectious agents and result in abscessing and
eventual tooth loss. In a comparison of Caddo
and Texas coastal hunter-gatherers, Colby (1997)
found that wear more often leads to dental
abscessing than cariogenesis.
Dental wear was assessed using the Smith
(1984) technique for the anterior teeth and the
Scott (1979) technique for the posterior teeth.
Table A.11, which presents the dental wear scores
for all individuals from the Pine Tree Mound site
along with average scores for each individual,
shows that dental wear correlates well with age.
Comparisons with other populations are difficult
due to the use of nonstandardized techniques in
early Caddo bioarcheological studies. For this
reason, in Burnettâs (1990, 1999) synthesis, she
describes dental wear as slight, moderate, and
severe. Dental wear was considerably less at
the Pine Tree Mound site than at the Cooper
Lake sites examined by Wilson and Steele
(1997), which is unexpected considering the
nearly equivalent average age at death for the
populations and the higher mean adult age
at death in the Pine Tree Mound population.
Dental attrition scores are comparable to those
from the Sanders and Mitchell sites (Wilson
1997), even though the adult average age at
death was higher for the Pine Tree population.
Sanders is an earlier Caddo site, while the
Mitchell site likely overlaps in time with the
Pine Tree Mound site. Colby (1997) reports
similar wear scores for 41RR16 with molars
averaging a score of 17 and premolars, canines,
and incisors averaging a score of 4. Another
Late Caddo site, the McLelland site from the
lower Red River, was analyzed using the Scott
(1979) technique (TinÃ© and Tieszen 1994). Like
Roitsch, Sanders, and Mitchell, the McLelland
population is comparable to the Pine Tree
population. This suggests a comparable amount
of grit or unprocessed vegetable fiber in the diets
at these four sites. Interestingly, these sites
represent both the Pine Forest and Post Oak
vegetation zones and one farmstead and three
mound sites. They include one Middle and three
Late Caddo sites. This suggests something other

Dietary choices are a reflection of cultural
norms and what the natural environment
will allow. A maize-intensive diet is one of the
hallmarks of the Caddo archeological culture and
is used to separate them from hunter-gatherer
neighbors and predecessors. To determine what
a population ate, most bioarcheologists focus on
dental remains and stable isotope analysis on
bone. This study uses dental remains to examine
foods consumed and processing strategies by
examining the presence of cariogenesis, dental
attrition, and abscessing. Reliance on maize
provides a sticky carbohydrate-rich dietary
source favorable to cariogenic microbial attack.
Cariogenesis can, in turn, provide the entry point
for infectious organisms to the rest of the body.
One of the important hypotheses the data
from the Pine Tree Mound burial population
can test is Burnettâs (1990, 1999) idea that the
Caddo of the middle Sabine and Pine Forest
did not depend on maize agriculture and that
maize carbohydrate consumption was low. She
based this assertion in part on the low frequency
of dental caries in her sample from the region
(Burnett 1990, 1999). The Pine Tree Mound
population does not support Burnettâs (1990,
1999) hypothesis.
Throughout the Americas, increased
reliance on maize resulted in increased dental
caries. Although Lee (1999) has called into
question a direct genetic link between Fourche
Maline populations and the Caddo, these
populations who preceded the Caddo and
had a much greater reliance on hunting and
gathering had fewer dental caries (Burnett
1999; Powell 1985; Rose 1984) than later Caddo
populations. Stable isotope results generally
agree with the interpretation of these results
when regional tempering is included (Gill-King
1999; Perttula 2008; TinÃ© and Tieszen 1994;
Wilson and Cargill 1993).
Other than diet and processing, dental
disorders are age cumulative. For this reason,
it is important to remember average ages at
death in comparative samples. Since the adult
average age at death for the Pine Tree Mound
site is higher than all comparable population
sets, dental disorders in the adult population
may be higher than in comparable populations.
Dental attrition is not necessarily a disorder
but the natural result of occlusal abrasion, the

Appendix A: Human Remains
than vegetation zone or location may be more
important in processing techniques in contrast
to what Burnett (1990, 1999) hypothesized.
Two Late Caddo populations with small
sample sizes contrast with the wear scores
seen in the Pine Tree Mound population.
The population from Cedar Grove, a Late to
Historic Caddo farmstead, differs ambiguously
(Rose 1984). Maxillary first molars are similar
in mean wear scores, but maxillary second
molars and mandibular first and second molars
are more heavily worn at Cedar Grove while
third molars are less heavily worn than in
the Pine Tree Mound population. Mean age at
death is not presented by Rose (1984), but the
differences among molars in wear patterning
suggest that something other than age is
influencing the data sets. Mean molar wear
scores are somewhat higher from the Late
Caddo Hardman site in the middle Ouachita
region (Burnett 1993).
Age is one of two basic components to
consider in examining caries frequency. Even
though average age at death for the middle
Sabine is comparable to the Pine Tree Mound
population, the occurrence of caries was found

to be low by Burnett (1990, 1999) in her regional
summary. Caries should be age progressive, but
this is not always the case with archeological
populations (Hillson 1979). It is not the case in the
Pine Tree population, nor is it true for the Cooper
Lake population (Wilson and Steele 1997) or the
Sanders and Mitchell populations (Wilson 1997).
The second factor is diet. A sticky
carbohydrate-rich diet high in sucrose should
produce a relatively high rate of caries. Bacterial
Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus
mutans in the mouth convert sucrose (in
maize) into an acid that destroys enamel and
underlying dentin. A range of 8 to 25 percent
carious teeth has been used to identify maize
agricultural populations (Cohen and Armelagos
1984; Powell 1985; Turner 1979). The Pine Tree
Mound population actually lies just above this
rate with 29 percent of the teeth having caries
(Table A.12). Table A.13 shows that this is
highest of the Caddo sites for which comparable
data are available, being most similar to the Late
Caddo Mitchell site on the Red River (Wilson
1997). As indicated by dental wear and caries,
the Pine Tree Mound population consumed
substantial amounts of maize.

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
Others have used what is called the caries
rate to discriminate populations that ate maize
from those that did not. Rose and Marks (1985)
use a caries of rate of 2.0 to differentiate between
high- and low-carbohydrate diets. Burnett (1990,
1999) gives a caries rate of 2.0 for the Late Caddo
from her summary data, a very low rate of 0.5 for
the Pine Forest region, and an even lower rate of

0.2 for the Middle Sabine River basin in which
the Pine Tree Mound site lies. With a caries
rate of 7.78, the Pine Tree Mound population
is higher than her three summary data sets in
which the Pine Tree Mound population falls.
Table A.13 shows that the Pine Tree Mound has
a high caries rate but not as high as the three
sites at Lake Naconiche in Nacogdoches County

(Wilson 2008) or Cedar Grove on the Red River
(Rose 1984). The Pine Tree Mound population
has a caries rate most similar to the Late Caddo
Copeland Ridge-Hedges population (Rose 1984)
from the Middle Ouachita River basin and the
Roitsch site population (Colby 1997), a Late
Caddo site in the Post-Oak Belt on the Red
River. Other Late Caddo sites with high caries
rates include Hardman Groups 2 and 3 (Burnett
1993) and McLelland (TinÃ© and Tieszen 1994).
All sites with low caries rates are from the Early
and Middle Caddo time periods.
A third factor to consider is the number
of individuals in a population with caries. All
the adults from the Pine Tree Mound site had
at least one dental caries. This frequency of
affected individuals is very high and consistent
with the only other Late Caddo mound site from
which this type of data was available. It is most
similar to the Mitchell site (Wilson 1997) where
91 percent of the adults had at least one dental
caries. The caries data indicate that time may
be more important in caries frequency than site
type and biotic zone.
Dental abscess frequency is an indication
of oral health. Colby (1997) hypothesizes that
caries were causal in abscess formation, so the
two should covary. Among the Caddo, they do
not, however, and a clear pattern has yet to be
established. Dental abscesses were not found in
the Pine Tree Mound site population, but this
may be a reflection of the few alveolar margins
and maxilla that were preserved. Colby (1997)
found significantly more abscesses in the Roitsch
population than in a group of coastal huntergatherers. From her findings, she suggests that
caries are more likely causal than dental attrition
in abscess formation. At Roitsch, Colby (1997)
found 38 percent of the population examined
affected by dental abscesses. Wilson found
31 percent of the Sanders population but only
9 percent of the Mitchell population affected,
but more of the Mitchell population experienced
dental caries. Wilson and Steele (1997) found
60 percent of the Cooper Lake population had
abscesses. Burnett (1990, 1999) found abscesses
rare throughout the Caddo region of Texas.

compared to other Caddo populations. Although
Burnettâs (1990, 1999) sample from the region
was small, consisting of eight individuals who
provided data on infection, she found much
lower rates of infection in the middle Sabine
and other regions south of the Red River
(which provided similarly small sample sizes).
Childhood stress can be the result of infection,
nutritional inadequacy, or physical abuse.
Burnett (1990, 1999) had no data on childhood
stress for most of these regions. Still, she felt
that the Caddo in this region were well adapted
to their environment.
Evidence of childhood stress in the Pine
Tree Mound population suggests that it was
better adapted to the cultural and natural
environment than other Caddo populations.
Enamel hypoplasia records a disruption in the
formation of enamel on teeth. It may be the
best record of fetal, infant, and early childhood
stress recorded in the human skeleton. Various
stressful events can produce enamel defects
during the time in which the enamel is being
formed, including infectious disease and
malnutrition. Genetic factors and trauma may
also influence enamel development. The nine
individuals from Pine Tree Mound site with
dental remains have a rate (22.2 percent) of
enamel hypoplasia that is low compared to other
Caddo samples for which data are available. It
is much lower than the rate seen in the Red
River basin (60.2 percent) (Burnett 1990, 1999).
Burnett reports a 64.2 percent rate for the Late
Caddo overall. The Pine Tree population has a
lower incidence than Wilson and Steele (1997)
found in the Cooper Lake region (36 percent).
Infectious disease also may be influenced
by genetic factors, nutritional status, population
density of agent and host, behavior, and
environment. Most infectious agents that affect
the skeleton are chronic and debilitating, since a
certain amount of time is required in the life of
the individual for the agent to affect bone. Bone
responds to an infection in a limited number
of ways, causing further challenges to specific
diagnoses for paleopathologists. Often only
through observing the pattern of bone response
throughout a skeleton can a specific diagnosis be
made; thus, preservation has a strong influence
on whether infectious disease rates can be
accurately determined.
Burnettâs (1990, 1999) data from the region
are limited, but she concludes that infection rates

PALEOPATHOLOGY
One of the goals of this study was to test
Burnettâs (1990) assertions that the Sabine
River Caddo had little infectious disease
719

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
in the middle Sabine were low, hypothesizing
that infection rates were related to the amount
of occupational debris. In a study of treponemal
infections throughout archeological populations
in Texas, Wilson (1998) found that population
density rather than longevity affected the
rate of infectious disease. Based on Burnettâs
(1990, 1999) hypothesis about location, the Pine
Tree Mound population would be expected to
have a low rate of infection, yet based on site
size and settlement density, infection rates
would be expected to be high. Unfortunately,
the poor preservation of the skeletal remains
recovered from the Pine Tree Mound site makes
statements about rates of infection tenuous. The
poor preservation results in under-reporting
of frequencies calculated on a per individual
basis. Only one individual from the Pine Tree
Mound site has evidence of possible infection.
Thus, the rate of infection would be calculated
at 6.7 percent, with no subadult infection and
12.5 percent of the adult population having
evidence of infection. Burnett (1990, 1999) found
16.7 percent of the adults and 33.3 percent of the
subadults from the middle Sabine had evidence
of infection. For the Late Caddo of the Red River
basin, the adult infection rate was 22.2 percent
and the subadult rate was 31 percent (Burnett
1990, 1999). While the difference between the
Pine Tree Mound population and the Late
Caddo sample from the Red River is small, the
frequency of infection in the Pine Tree Mound
population is problematic and cannot be used
to adequately test Burnettâs (1990, 1999)
hypotheses.
Lee (1997) examined two populations from
the Late Caddo mound and village complex at
the Hatchel and Mitchell sites on the Red River.
She found that 31.2 percent of the individuals
from Hatchel and 51.6 percent from Mitchell had
evidence of infection. These rates are higher than
those reported for McLelland (TinÃ© and Tieszen
1994) (25.0 percent) and Cedar Grove (Rose
1984) (22.2 percent), two Late Caddo farmsteads
farther down the Red River. This supports
Wilsonâs (1998) findings that settlement density
is directly related to infection rates.
The evidence of infectious disease was
found in Feature 2.167 and consisted of a healed
suprinion depression. This is recorded as focal
bone loss on the occipital above the superior
nuchal line, which can be described as a shallow
depression that was difficult to discern due to

the degree of healing that had occurred. There
was extremely highly vascularized bone at the
margins of the depression; the margins were
no longer sharply defined. The depression itself
measured approximately 26 mm in height and
20 mm in the median plane. This author has
seen numerous suprinion depressions among
the Caddo, and they are the result of a localized
infection whose source is unknown and may
be related to the practice of cranial modeling
producing a localized sore.
Porotic hyperostosis has been used as an
indicator of nutritional stress in the form of
iron-deficient anemia (El-Najjar et al. 1976)
and as an indicator of parasite load (Kent
1986). Porotic hyperostosis is found rarely in
scurvy, which has not been documented for the
Caddo. Observations of porotic hyperostosis are
complicated by diagnosis. When diploÃ« are not
expanded, porosity may be the result of healed
porotic hyperostosis or periosteal reaction to
an insect infestation of the scalp or fungal or
bacterial infection of the scalp. It is also possible
that a combination of anemia, scalp inflamation,
or scalp infection may have occurred in a given
population or individual. Caution must therefore
be used in attributing what has been termed
porotic hyperostosis to anemia. Lee (1997) is
the only researcher to adequately describe this
phenomenon for a given Caddo population. Lee
(1997) found 89 percent of the Hatchel and
56 percent of the Mitchell population had porotic
hyperostosis and/or cranial porosity. Porotic
hyperostosis and/or cranial porosity is absent in
the Pine Tree Mound population. Burnett (1990,
1999) found porotic hyperostosis to be most
common in the Blackland Prairie and did not
find it in the Pine Forest. Porotic hyperostosis
occurred in a high incidence among the Cooper
Lake population (18.5 percent) (Wilson and
Steele 1997).
Traumatic injury was not observed in
the Pine Tree Mound site population. While
traumatic injury is relatively rare among
the Caddo, the results at Pine Tree may be
influenced by the state of preservation and small
sample size. Wilson and Steele (1997) report a
very high incidence of trauma in the Cooper
Lake population at 9.2 percent.
Degenerative joint disease is an indicator
of biomechanical stress in a population.
Degenerative joint disease, or arthritis, here
refers to degenerative changes in the synovial
720

Appendix A: Human Remains
joints and vertebral column. Degenerative joint
disease is typically the result of stresses from
repeated motions through time, but can also
result from a single episode injury. As the fluidfilled joint capsule breaks down, bone responds
by expansion of the surface area with marginal
lipping, erosion of the joint surface, and finally
eburnation (hardening and polishing), from
direct bone-to-bone contact.
Observations of degenerative joint disease
are dependent on the preservation of joint
surfaces. Due to the cancellous bone that
underlies joint surfaces, they are less often
preserved than cortical bone diaphyses. One
individual in the Pine Tree sample (11.1 percent
of the adults), Body 2 in Feature 8.1085, has
evidence of degenerative joint disease. This took
the form of osteophytosis and surface porosity
of the centrum, superior and inferior articular
facets of preserved cervical vertebrae. Loveland
(1994) and Wilson (1994) report this to be a
common location for arthritis among Red River
Caddo.
The low rate of degenerative joint disease
is undoubtedly a result of the poor preservation
and lack of joint surfaces in the Pine Tree Mound
population. Yet, a lower rate of degenerative
joint disease is reported by Burnett (1990,
1999) for the Late Caddo period as a whole
(8.6 percent) and for the Pine Forest in general
(2.1 percent) than seen in the Pine Tree Mound
population. Wilson and Steele (1997) report
a rate of 38.9 percent in the Cooper Lake
population. Where preservation is better, rates
of degenerative joint disease are higher. For
example, Loveland (1994) found osteophytosis
in 57.7 percent of the males and 46.4 percent of
the females from the Kaufman-Williams sample
she analyzed. Likewise, Wilson (1994) found
78 percent of the Sanders population had some
form of degenerative joint disease. At other sites
along the Red River with good preservation,
Lee (1997) found arthritis in 67 percent of the
population from the Hatchel site and 65 percent
from the Mitchell site. Another site with a high
frequency of arthritis is the McLelland site,
where 75 percent of the population was affected
(TinÃ© and Tieszen 1994). The question remains
whether the differences represent a difference
in preservation or a difference in geographic
region or time.
An interesting observation was made on
three of the individuals from the Pine Tree

Mound site pertaining to physiological stress: an
extreme gracility of diaphyses and an absence
of muscle markings at muscle attachment sites.
This was observed on Features 2.167, 2.186,
and 8.1100. All three are female and were
expected to have muscle definition typical of
similarly aged Caddo females from other sites.
The lack of muscle definition suggests a lack of
physical exercise sufficient to affect the bone
and is uncommon compared to other Caddo
females from relatively high-status burials
(Wilson 1994). It suggests a stratification of
physiological stress coincident with differences
in social status.
The question thus remains, were levels of
infection and other indicators of physiological
stress lower in populations south of the Red
River? The Pine Tree Mound skeletal series
cannot adequately address the issue of infection
due to its poor preservation, but it does change
the question. Perhaps instead of asking if the
infection rate is lower, the question should be
whether preservation is worse south of the Red
River, and if so, how this limits the information
available for study. At the Pine Tree Mound
site, preservation has clearly influenced the
ability to address issues of physiological stress.
The frequency of enamel hypoplasia in the
population may be the only representative
factor in an examination of physiological stress,
since enamel preserves better than bone. The
relatively low occurrence within the Pine Tree
Mound population suggests that there was
less childhood stress in this part of the Sabine
basin than in other parts of the Caddo region;
however, the best comparative data come from
a population from farmsteads and hamlets on
the margin of the region (Cooper Lake) rather
than villages associated with mounds.
CULTURAL MODIFICATION
Cultural modification of the body is an
effective form of group identification in human
societies and can be useful to archeologists
in reconstructing ethnic and group identity.
Cranial modeling is one of the most common
forms of body adornment that preserves in
hard tissue and is available to archeologists for
study of cultural norms of beautification. Cranial
modeling was practiced by the Caddo and
documented both archeologically (Derrick and
Wilson 1997) and ethnohistorically (Swanton
721

1942). Since cranial modeling occurs early in
life when an infantâs cranial bones are relatively
ductile, cranial modeling reflects the group
identification to which the parents or another
authority figure wish their child to be perceived
as belonging.
Table A.14 documents the frequency and
types of cranial modeling in the Pine Tree
Mound population. Three styles of cranial
modeling as well as the lack of modeling
occurred. Both annular and tabular styles were
observed, indicating that both hard and soft
devices were used to produce the desired results.
Annular modeling involves the tight circular
wrapping of the infant head with soft materials
like animal skin or cloth, or the application
of removable pads or cords (Rogers 1975). It
results in a distinctive conically shaped head
often with a coronal saddle occurring posterior
to the bregma. Tabular forms of modeling are
produced by immobilizing the infant head
between boards and is differentiated from
unintentional flattening of the back of the head
cause by a cradleboard. Tabular styles among the
Caddo result in a flattened frontal and occipital
with expansion of the parietals (Derrick and
Wilson 1997). Four styles of cranial modeling as
well as unintentional lambdoid flattening have
been documented among the Caddo (Derrick
and Wilson 1997). The most common style was
tabular fronto-vertico-occipital (Derrick and
Wilson 1997), and this was the style observed
in Feature 2.167. Both tabular forms in the
Pine Tree Mound population were in females,
as was the single unmodeled cranium, while

the individual with annular parallelo-frontooccipital modeling was male. Derrick and Wilson
(1997) found no difference in style based on sex
of the individual. The results from the Pine
Tree Mound population confirm what Derrick
and Wilson (1997) found based on context: that
mound centers had all styles and no modeling
represented while annular styles were rare in
other contexts.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Skeletal or dental remains representing
15 individuals were recovered from 14 graves
at the Pine Tree Mound site. Five of these
were recovered from Area 2, and 10 were from
Area 8. These were examined together as a
site population rather than separately due to
a shared temporal context and small sample
size. All but 1 grave consisted single interments.
Some had numerous offerings and indicated
relatively high social status.
The state of preservation was generally
poor. Nearly half of the estimated 29 individuals
excavated contained no skeletal or dental remains.
The site mean for skeletal completeness is only
3 percent, with the most-complete individual
having just 30 percent of its elements represented.
The skeletal preservation is not unlike that at other
southern Caddo sites. Poor bone preservation in
the region can be attributed to acidic soils leaching
organics during periods of repeated wetting and
slow drying. Because of the poor preservation, many
metric, nonmetric, and pathological observations
could not be made adequately.
722

Appendix A: Human Remains
The poor preservation made it difficult
to address issues of body size and sexual
dimorphism. More cranial measurements were
possible than postcranial. Sexual dimorphism
is suggested in these measurements, but these
are not used to examine sexual dimorphism due
to the large overlap exhibited cross culturally.
Postcranial measurements were taken on the
tibia from Feature 2.186. These fall within the
range given by Doran (1975) and Wilson and
Steele (1997).
Although hampered by poor preservation,
the issue of the genetic relationships of the Pine
Tree Mound population to nearby populations
could be addressed in a fashion. Skeletal traits
could be observed on only five individuals, while
dental traits were observed on nine individuals.
Leeâs (1999) hypothesis that biological distance
among the Caddo was more affected by social
status than geography appears to be supported
by the Pine Tree Mound site data, where
grave goods indicate relatively high status for
some burials. Most of the cranial and dental
traits reinforce Leeâs (1999) findings that the
population in this region was homogenous
compared to those in the Red River valley,
but the few differences suggest that greater
population admixture or some genetic drift
may have occurred in the Pine Tree Mound site
population, as occurred at large mound sites
throughout the region. When coupled with
Derrick and Wilsonâs (1997) study of cranial
modeling, greater population admixture at
large mound sites seems a more favorable
hypothesis for the Pine Tree Mound site and
likely throughout the Caddo region.
This study disproves Burnettâs (1990, 1999)
hypothesis that populations south of the Red
River were not reliant on maize agriculture. The
Pine Tree Mound further adds to a pattern of
higher frequencies of caries in the Late Caddo
period, implying that time may be more important
in dietary influence than geography, type of site,
or social status. Dental caries in the Pine Tree
Mound population, as indicated by the percent
of individuals affected, percent of carious teeth,
and caries rate, show that the Pine Tree Mound
population consumed substantial amounts of
maize. Stable isotope studies would do much to
evaluate this interpretation, as starchy seeds
and fruits can also elevate caries rates. Wear
scores from the Pine Tree Mound site support
a hypothesis that food processing techniques

among the Caddo changed during the Woodland/
Early Caddo period and then remained constant
into the Historic period, further supporting the
idea that maize was most likely the dietary staple
that affected caries frequencies.
This study cannot adequately test Burnettâs
(1990, 1999) hypothesis that peoples inhabiting
drainages to the south of the Red River had a
greater adaptive efficiency in the form of lower
infection rates and lack of porotic hyperostosis.
Paleopathological study of the Pine Tree
Mound population was heavily influenced by
poor preservation. This raises the question of
preservation in the region as a factor in shaping
Burnettâs (1990, 1999) hypothesis. Enamel
hypoplasia and porotic hyperostosis are the only
indicators of adaptive efficiency that are not
influenced by poor preservation to the degree
of infection, degenerative joint disease, and
trauma. These suggest that the Pine Tree Mound
population may have been relatively healthy.
The low occurrence of enamel hypoplasia and
lack of porotic hyperostosis within the Pine
Tree Mound population suggests that there was
better health in Caddo populations of the middle
Sabine or Pine Forest than in other Caddo
regions, but certainly more data are needed to
evaluate this.

INTRODUCTION

3 inches, but they overlie clay and silty clay
loams. Both soils would have been suitable for
small prehistoric agricultural plots, as would
soils upstream from the site along Potters and
Starkey Creeks. The upstream soils are Iuka fine
sandy loams, frequently flooded but moderately
well drained, consisting of sandy loam to 80
inches. Despite the slightly wider floodplains,
soils downstream from the site are too wet for
prehistoric cultivation. They consist of SardisMathiston complex soils, frequently flooded and
somewhat poorly drained, underlain by silty clay
loam (Soil Survey Staff 2008).
Mean annual precipitation in Harrison
County was 46.4 inches during the period
1951â1980, with a record of 70.2 inches in
1979 (Natural Fibers Information Center
1987:225). Rainfall is distributed evenly
throughout the year (Diggs et al. 2006:79). On
average, the county has 55 days in which the
temperature dips to or below 32Â°F (Natural
Fibers Information Center 1987:225). For
ancient maize agriculture in the southeast, the
greatest risk to crops was usually spring flooding
rather than frosts or insufficient rain (Scarry
1986). East Texas rivers flood frequently and
quickly, and their floodplains can be wet. As
noted above, agricultural fields associated with
Pine Tree Mound were probably not located on
river floodplains but rather on tributary streams
or second terraces or in upland areas. Even in
upland areas, the sandy soils would have been
easy to till with digging sticks.

Pine Tree Mound is a large Late Caddo
site with at least three mounds, multiple
village areas, and multiple cemeteries located
southwest of modern Marshall, Texas, between
Potters Creek and Starkey Creek. The site is
situated on a portion of a high upland ridge
crest. Springs on the site feed to both creeks.
The main channel of the Sabine River, to which
both creeks run, lies approximately 10 km south
of the site. The ancient road system known as
the Hasinai Trace, later Trammelâs Trace, runs
within a kilometer of Pine Tree Mound site
(Fields 2008:4; Vernon 2009).
Radiocarbon dates indicate site use
primarily between a.d. 1400 and the mid 1600s
with some occupation in the 1300s and perhaps
the 1700s. Pine Tree Mound was therefore
occupied at the time the de Soto/Moscoso
expedition traveled through the area, probably
using the Hasinai Trace. Circumstantial
evidence associates Pine Tree Mound with the
Nondacao location mentioned by Biedma and the
Gentleman of Elvas (Fields 2008). The expedition
party met the chief of this area, who provided
gifts of fish and a guideâlater tortured and
thrown to the dogsâfor their continued travel
southwest, but the expedition did not visit the
village (Clayton et al. 1994:145, 244). The land
of Nondacao is described as âa very populous
regionâ with âan abundance of maizeâ (Clayton
et al. 1994:145). Whether Pine Tree Mound can
be conclusively identified as Nondacao or not,
expedition accounts describe Caddo ancestors
living at villages analogous toâif not identical
withâPine Tree Mound.
Pine Tree Mound has been known as an
archeological site since the 1960s and subject
to professional investigations since 1996. This
report documents macrobotanical remains
from excavations that took place in 2004 and
2006â2007.

Historic Accounts
Accounts of European explorers and early
settlers give some indication of the vegetation of
east Texas prior to the introduction of large-scale
logging in the late 1800s (Diggs et al. 2006:84).
Fray Isidro FÃ©lix de Espinosa, who lived at La
PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n from 1715 to 1721, when it
was located in east Texas, commented generally
on the economic possibilities of the land:

ECOLOGICAL SETTING

The entire country is filled with various
kinds of trees, such as oaks, pines,
cottonwoods, live-oaks, large nutsâ
which yield the thick shelled nutsâand
another kind of tree which yields small
thin shelled nuts. The Indians use all
of these as food. In addition to the nut

Soils in the site area are primarily Bernaldo
fine sandy loams and Eastwood very fine sandy
loams (Soil Survey Staff 2008). Bernaldo fine
sandy loams are composed of 3 inches of welldrained sandy loams overlying loam soils.
Eastwood soils are also considered well drained
and also consist of sandy loam to a depth of
729

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
bearing trees, there other fruit trees,
like the medlar [probably hawthorn],
the plum and the large wild cherry.
Among them there is found a white
grape that looks like a muscatel. It only
needs cultivation to make it as good as
the domestic variety.

Louisiana, and Crockett, Texas: âThis region
may generally be regarded as of rather thin
soil; yet much of it fertile character, producing
Indian corn and most vegetables reasonably
well, and cotton very finely. This latter should
be regarded as the great staple of those regions.
The timber is mostly post-oak, black-jack, black
hickory and in some places short-leaf pitchpine. We also find sweet gum, chinquopin, and
many other growths, with great abundance of
sassafras [east] of the waters of the Trinity river.
As yet, we find no prairies on this route, except
as an occasional insignificant, timberless gladeâ
(Gregg 1941:207).

There are great quantities of red
and white mulberries and large
blackberries which are very sweet,
a great abundance of pomegranates
like those in China, and a quantity
of chestnuts [chinkapins], although
the fruit they yield is small, about
like the white-oak acorns [Hatcher
1927a:152â153].

Modern Studies
Modern ecologists divide the Pineywoods
into two general zones, one dominated by longleaf
pine (Pinus palustris) and one by shortleaf pine
(P. echinata) and hardwoods (Braun 1950; Diggs
et al. 2006). Longleaf pine forests in Texas form
a rough half-circle centered on the easternmost
point in Texas (northern Newton County) and
reach into southern Nacogdoches and San
Augustine Counties (Diggs et al. 2006; Gow
1905:43). The remainder of the Texas Pineywoods
is dominated by shortleaf pines and deciduous
hardwoods. Pine forests in the United States
are maintained by fire, and fire suppression
contributes to greater representation of hardwood
species (Abrahamson and Hartnett 1990; Frost
1993). American longleaf pine forests, in the outer
coastal plain, are associated with large tracts of
land that lack natural firebreaks and probably
experienced fire every two or three years (Frost
1993:21). Areas of shortleaf pine and hardwoods
are those where natural barriers result in lower,
but still significant, fire frequency (Frost 1993:21).
The immediate area of the Pine Tree Mound
site would have been a shortleaf pine community
for most of the Holocene. In shortleaf pine
forests, pine trees share dominance with oaks
and hickories. Common woody plants of these
communities are shown in Table B.1. These
communities are uncommon today, the shortleaf
pines having been largely replaced by loblolly
pines (Diggs et al. 2006:88â89).
Loblolly pine communities were present in
presettlement times but were usually confined to
steep ravines and tributary streams where fires
were less common. A list of species common in
these communities is given in Table B.2.

The crossing of the Sabine River was usually
noted by eighteenth- and early-nineteenthcentury diarists, as it marked their departure
from the United States. Most crossed downstream
of Harrison County as they traveled from
Natchitoches to Nacogdoches and San Antonio,
but their comments are worth recording.
Amos Parker crossed the river in 1834 or
1835, noting its lack of agricultural potential:
âThe Sabine has two or three miles of good bottom
land on each side, heavily timbered; but it is too
much subject to inundation to be cultivated. After
we passed the river bottom, we came to gentle
swells of red clayey soil, covered with oak, hickory
&c. called oak openings. Sometimes we passed a
small prairieâ ( Parker 1835:118).
Josiah Gregg must have passed very near
Pine Tree Mound during his travels in 1842:
âTraveled on what is termed Trammellâs Trace,
between 35 and 40 miles to the Sabine River.â¦
Its valleys here are marshy and low, and show
signs of overflow to the height in many places
to ten or twelve feetâFrom what I can learn
there are very few if any parts of the bottoms
of this river which can ever be cultivated. This
country passed over today is a good deal of
the character of that of yesterdayâmost of
pine woodsâintermixt with occasional oaks,
dogwood, chinkapins, etc.â (Gregg 1941:117).
According to Greggâs entry for the previous
day, the oaks he encountered were post oak and
blackjack oak. His âetc.â would have included
black hickory and shortleaf pine. In July 1846,
Gregg made general observations about east
Texas, specifically the land between Greenwood,

The Sabine River floodplain below the site
would have offered a slightly different ecosystem
than the uplands or creeks. Rivers in east Texas
are meandering and flow slowly. Because of the
abundant rainfall, they tend to overflow their
banks, producing broad floodplains with alluvial
sand, silt, and clay deposits (Diggs et al. 2006:78).
Floodplain forests in the Pineywoods are places
where fire-sensitive species can survive; the
conditions also necessitate flood-tolerant species.
731

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
On larger, wetter floodplains such as the Sabine
River, dominant trees are mostly oaks, including
willow oak (Quercus phellos), laurel oak (Q.
laurifolia), and overcup oak (Q. lyrata). In
swamps and backwaters, baldcypress (Taxodium
distichum), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), and
water elm (Planera aquatica) are important
(Diggs et al. 2006:90).
Although Gregg minimized the importance
of forest openings, many small prairies were
present in the Pineywoods. Often noted are the
âRedlandsâ around Nacogdoches, but prairies
were also found elsewhere (Diggs et al. 2006:82).
Fray Francisco Hiladgo noted in 1710 that âThe
whole country, as far as it has been examined,
is wooded. It contains many small open spaces,
and stretches of sand and marshes where the
Indians liveâ (Hatcher 1927b:55).

than during the last century or so (Diggs et al.
2006:81; Gow 1905). Certainly, early explorers
in east Texas and other parts of the Eastern
Woodlands noted the open, parklike nature
of many woodlands (Diggs et al. 2006:80â81;
Hutchinson et al. 2003). Todd Hutchinson
and colleagues, like many earlier researchers,
attribute much of the forestsâ openness to the
use of fire by Native Americans (e.g., Cronon
1983:49â51 and sources cited therein; Delcourt
and Delcourt 1997, 1998).
METHODS
Flotation samples from Pine Tree Mound
site were processed at Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., in a Flote-Tech flotation machine with
bottom mesh openings of 1.0 mm. Although
bottom mesh openings of 0.6 mm are optimal for
the recovery of small seeds, the sandy soils are
unlikely to have passed through this mesh size
(Bush 2001:91â92, and Table 3.10; Hunter and
Gassner 1998). The presence of uncarbonized
carpetweed seeds (Mollugo verticillata) in 150
of the 167 flotation samples demonstrates that
the system was sufficient for the recovery of
many small seeds. Carpetweed seeds have an
average diameter of about 0.7 mm. Not all
carbonized plant material rose to the top of the
flotation tank to be included in the original light
fractions, however. Flotation heavy fractions
were inspected for charcoal, which was removed
by hand and added to the light fractions prior
to sorting.
Flotation samples were sorted according
to standard procedures at the Macrobotanical
Analysis laboratory in Manchaca, Texas
(Pearsall 2000). Each flotation sample was
weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200x0.01-g
electronic balance before being size sorted
through a stack of graduated geologic mesh.
Materials that did not pass through the No. 10
mesh (2 mm) were completely sorted, and all
carbonized botanical remains were counted,
weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized
botanical material greater than 2 mm (usually
rootlets) was weighed, recorded, and labeled as
âcontamination.â Materials that fell through the
2-mm mesh (âresidueâ) were examined under a
stereoscopic microscope at 7â45x magnification
for carbonized botanical remains. Identifiable
material other than wood, corn, nutshells, and
pine cone fragments were removed from residue

Vegetation Reconstructions
The Texas Pineywoods were largely
destroyed in a 50-year period prior to 1935 (Diggs
et al. 2006:86). Nonetheless, modern equivalents
exist for prehistoric plant communities despite
changes in the abundance and structure
of the communities (Diggs et al. 2006:86).
Pollen studies indicate that use of the modern
vegetation zones described above is appropriate
for understanding the plants and attendant
animal resources available to Caddo people
during the first and second millennia. Weakly
Bog, situated in what is now the Post Oak
Savannah vegetation region to the southwest of
Harrison County, provides some of the best data
for vegetation reconstruction in the eastern half
of Texas during the last 3,000 years (Bousman
1998). Pollen profiles from this bog indicate oak
and later oak-hickory woodlands, suggesting
that modern plant communities generally
provide good analogs for historical Texas plant
communities during the last 3,000 years. A
recent study by Bruce Albert (2007) in southwest
Upshur County provides supporting data for
the period of occupation at Pine Tree Mound.
Some fluctuations in rainfall and temperature
have occurred (Bousman 1998:204), but even
decades-long fluctuations in rainfall patterns
seem to be part of the natural background of
late Holocene climate patterns (Stahle and
Cleaveland 1992). In addition, more-frequent
fires would have made the understory in the
ancient forest uplands much less prominent
732

Appendix B: Macrobotanical Analysis
Point Samples

and counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled.
All ceramics and faunal material greater than
2 mm and smaller material that appeared
identifiable were counted, weighed, labeled, and
returned to Prewitt and Associates for analysis.
Partially carbonized wood and bark and the
single semicarbonized acorn fragment recovered
from the site were treated in the same manner
as fully carbonized material, although they are
interpreted as modern. Other uncarbonized
macrobotanical remains were recorded on a
presence/absence basis on laboratory forms.
Plant samples that were not derived
from flotation were not usually sieved in
the laboratory. Rather, any chunks of soil
were removed by hand. When loose soil was
encountered, samples were placed on a No. 10
mesh (2 mm), and the soil that fell through the
mesh was scanned for plant material before
being discarded. Plant material recovered from
nonflotation samples (usually wood charcoal,
nutshells, or pine cones) was identified, counted,
weighed, and labeled in the same manner as
material from flotation samples.
Wood charcoal identification was attempted
for 20 randomly selected specimens from each
sample. Wood charcoal fragments were snapped
to reveal a transverse section and examined
under a stereoscopic microscope at 28â180x
magnification. When necessary, tangential or
radial sections were examined for ray seriation,
presence of spiral thickenings, types and
sizes of intervessel pitting, and other minute
characteristics that can only be seen at the
higher magnifications of this range.
Botanical materials were identified to the
lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison
to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis
comparative collection and through the use of
standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979;
Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; InsideWood 2004;
Martin and Barkley 1961; Panshin and de Zeeuw
1980). Plant nomenclature follows that of the
PLANTS Database (USDA, NCRS 2008).

Point samples from Pine Tree Mound
consist of flora recovered from contexts that
were not flotation processed. They are primarily
samples of charcoal concentrations taken
for radiocarbon dating or charcoal recovered
during routine screening of excavated matrix.
A total of 55 samples were analyzed, of which
49 are interpreted as archeological (including
uncarbonized Juglans nigra wood from shaft
grave Feature 136, which was preserved because
it was below the water table and stayed wet). The
remaining 6 samples, from Features 2.068, 8.024,
and 8.026, contained primarily semicarbonized
and uncarbonized material and are believed
to represent modern plants (see discussion of
uncarbonized and semicarbonized remains in
the Flotation Samples section, below).
The point samples contain plant remains
comparable to the larger flotation-recovered
plants, i.e., wood, nutshell, pine cone, and corn
(Table B.5). The composition of the wood charcoal
assemblage from point samples is more limited
but compares well to that from flotation samples,
with both dominated by oak. The point samples
are notable for containing five of the seven intact
corn cob fragments recovered from Pine Tree
Mound. They are discussed below with the corn
recovered by flotation. Only one notable plant
type is more common in the point samples than
in the flotation samples. Bulb scale fragments
were recovered from Features 2.1689B and
8.065-4. Epidermal cell structure is not visible
in these scale fragments, so the particular
plant they represent is unknown. Wild garlic
(Allium spp.) and camas (Camassia scilloides)
are likely, although other bulbs such as rainlily
(Cooperia spp.) are possible. Both meadow garlic
(Allium canadense) and Drummondâs onion (A.
drummondii) are common on well-drained soils
in east Texas. Ethnographically, wild onions were
widely used in North America for food, especially
as a relish or flavoring (Gilmore 1991:19;
Moerman 1998:56â59). They also have medicinal
uses (Densmore 1974:286; Moerman 1998:56â59).

RESULTS

Flotation Samples

This analysis consisted of examination of
55 point samples from 48 proveniences and 167
flotation samples from 155 proveniences (Tables
B.3 and B.4). The results are presented, sample
by sample, in Attachments B.1âB.4 (on compact
disc only).

Most of the 167 flotation samples come
from the residential areas of the site, and nearly
half of all samples were taken from postholes.
Because the posthole samples were necessarily

small, they represent only about one-quarter
of the 688 liters of soil flotation processed. Pits
are by far the best represented feature types
by soil volume. Distributions of the samples by
location and feature type are shown in Tables
B.6 and B.7.

North America, uncarbonized plant material at
open-air sites can be assumed to be of modern
origin unless compelling evidence suggests
otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek
1987:231). Pine Tree Mound has offered no such
evidence (other than shaft grave Feature 136),
and only carbonized plant remains are believed
to be ancient.

Uncarbonized Plant Remains

Semicarbonized Plant
Remains

Most uncarbonized remains in the flotation
samples appear in the form of rootlets, wood tissue,
grass blades, and leaves and are included with
the âcontaminationâ in Table B.4. Uncarbonized
seeds were recovered from every sample, and
the taxa found are listed in Table B.8. With two
exceptions, the seeds consist of weedy annuals
likely to be present on disturbed sites undergoing
archeological investigations. The exceptions, pine
and a possible hackberry fragment, are common
trees in east Texas. Uncarbonized seeds are a
common occurrence at most archeological sites,
but they usually represent seeds of modern
plants that have made their way into the soil
either through their own dispersal mechanisms
or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or
argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51â52; Miksicek
1987:231â232). In all except the driest areas of

Fifteen flotation samples included
semicarbonized material. The material consists
mostly of oak and pine wood and bark, along
with a single piece of acorn nutshell, sumac
wood, and indeterminable wood (see Table B.5).
Oaks and most pines are not decay-resistant
woods, and even the most durable of them,
longleaf pine, is classified as only âmoderately
resistantâ (Hoadley 1990:Table 6.1; Panshin and
deZeeuw 1980:Table 10-1). Hence, it is likely
that the semicarbonized materials are modern
in origin. The presence of semicarbonized
plant remains does not indicate that all
carbonized remains in the same feature are also
modern, though. Elsewhere in the Sabine Mine

locality, at 41HS231, radiocarbon assays from
features containing semicarbonized material
produced Middle and Late Caddo dates (Bush
2008a:170). The archeological features selected
for macrobotanical analysis from Pine Tree
Mound generally exhibited integrity in the field,
but in shallow sandy sites such as this, finding
intrusive modern remains in archeological
contexts is not surprising. While carbonized
material of the same taxa as semicarbonized

material may not be ancient, other carbonized
material in those features probably is.
Carbonized Plant Remains

flotation samples by area is provided in Table

Mound appears to represent primary deposition
of wood charcoal: the burned wall posts from
Overlook house (Features 2.219, 2.220, 2.230,
and 2.231). The only wood charcoal identified
from these four postholes is red oak group.
Although burned houses sometimes yield a
wealth of carbonized plant remains (e.g., Hally

Wood Charcoal
Structural Wood
At least one set of features at Pine Tree
745

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
1981), the Overlook house appears to have
been cleaned and abandoned before it burned.
Overlook house in general contains fewer types
of plant remains than other houses. Other
postholes with only one kind of wood, perhaps
indicating primary deposition, are two wall
postholes in Middle house (Feature 2.538 with
red oak and Feature 2.552 with white oak), two
wall postholes in Pluto C house (Features 2.1441
and 2.1443 with white oak), and three wall
postholes in Hummingbird A house (Feature
8.287 with red oak and Features 8.290 and 8.771
with white oak).

and Prins 1992). Self-pruning trees may be
overrepresented archeologically, and species
intended for other uses may be underrepresented
archeologically (Asch and Asch 1986; Dufraisse
2008). In addition, ethnohistorical sources
indicate that Native Americans were well aware
of the burning properties of different woods
and exploited them accordingly (e.g., Gilmore
1933:139; Zigmond 1981:57). Nonetheless,
the broad assumption of firewood indifference
is followed here except when archeological
evidence indicates that a particular wood was
selected for fuel use, as is the case in Feature
2.002, the smudge pit containing large densities
of red oak wood.
At Pine Tree Mound, identification was
attempted for 2,665 pieces of wood charcoal from
flotation, of which 2,473 were identifiable to
botanical family, genus, or species. Seventy-one
percent of identifiable wood charcoal is oak; 61
percent of oak could be identified as white oak,
and 37 percent is red oak. After oak, hickory and
pine are the next most common woods.
Trees exploited at Pine Tree Mound
suggest the shortleaf pine forest described
above as the likely plant community in the
immediate vicinity of the site (see Table B.1).
Oaks and hickories are common, and sweetgum
is also present. Pine itself is underrepresented,
probably because it makes a poor fuel wood.
Several trees not typically associated with
shortleaf pine communities are also represented
at Pine Tree Mound. These include riparian
species such as willow, sycamore, and blackgum,
as well as beech, elm, maple, and holly that are
more typical of loblolly-hardwood communities.
Sumac,1 which makes up nearly 6 percent
of the wood at Pine Tree Mound, is not a typical
plant in any of the communities described above.
Although George Diggs and colleagues note
it as a common shrub in arenic mixed upland
forests of the Pineywoods, other constituents
of these forests, such as sassafras, blackgum,

Fuel Wood
With the exception of the postholes described
above and probably smudge pits, wood charcoal
from Pine Tree Mound was recovered from
secondary or tertiary contexts such as middens,
pits, or postholes that filled with general site
debris when the posts decayed or were moved
to another location. In general, pits described
as smudge pits did not contain different
types of remains than other pits or midden
samples, but the contexts of these features
suggest they are primary deposits. One smudge
pit is particularly noteworthy for the sheer
density of macrobotanical remains. Densities
of macrobotanical remains in other Pine Tree
Mound features are distributed continuously
from 0.01 to 7.46 g/liter, but Feature 2.002 is an
extreme outlier at 134.65 g/liter. Feature 2.002 is
on the extreme western edge of Area 2. Its plant
remains consist almost entirely of red oak wood.
Wood charcoal recovered from most contexts
at Pine Tree Mound is assumed to represent fuel
wood. Archeological theories known variously
as the âfirewood indifference hypothesisâ or the
âPrincipal of Least Effortâ predict that firewood
should reflect in a relatively straightforward
manner the local environment at the time of
occupation (Asch and Asch 1986; Shackelton

A note on sumac identification: Sumac, poison sumac, poison oak, and poison ivy are close relatives.
Despite the name, poison sumac is not part of the sumac (Rhus) genus; it is currently classified in Toxicodendron
with poison oak and poison ivy. The seeds of Rhus, which were also recovered at Pine Tree Mound, are readily
distinguishable from Toxicodendron seeds. Rhus wood, however, cannot be reliably separated from Toxicodendron.
The sumac wood at Pine Tree Mound has been assigned to Rhus because of the presence of sumac fruits
elsewhere on the site, because Rhus plants are typically larger and woodier than Toxicodendron plants, and
because deliberate burning of Toxicodendron wood is unlikely since it produces fumes that typically cause
allergic reaction in humans.

and blackberry, are absent or rare at Pine
Tree Mound (Diggs et al. 2006:93). Sumac is
usually found in forest openings and margins
and is often spread by birds, who are fond of
the fruits (Simpson 1999:305). Sumac can form
large colonies by suckering. The above two
characteristic lead to sumac often colonizing
old agricultural fields. At Pine Tree Mound, the
abundance of sumac likely reflects the presence
of old agricultural fields in the area as well as
active fields.

recovery further complicate matters (Goette
et al. 1994). One researcher has prudently
posted a disclaimer that âMeasurements of
cob diameter [etc.] . . . have no particular
interpretive significanceâ (Puseman 2006).
Nonetheless, there is an interpretive tradition
in Texas that associates archeological corn
cobs with known corn types. Eileen Goldborer
(2002:85) sums it thus: âCorn recovered from
a number of well-investigated prehistoric
archeological sites in East Texas give a general
impression of representing a small variety of
Eastern Complex corn.â
The seven intact corn cob fragments from
Pine Tree Mound will not provide appreciable
resolution to a vague and impressionistic
situation, but they do provide additional data
points. Measurements of corn from Pine Tree
Mound are provided for comparison with corn
from other sites and to document what appear
to be two types of corn rather than to assign
the archeological corn to living or historically
known corn types.
Frances King (1994) recommends row
number, rachis segment length, cupule length,
and cupule width as the most informative
measurements for archeological corn studies.
These and qualitative data are given in Table
B.12, taken according to Robert Birdâs (1994)
instructions. As Table B.13 shows, cupule
measurements of cob fragments from Pine
Tree Mound are consistent with measurements
taken of Caddo corn from sites in Texas such
as Stallings, Timber Hill, and Oak Hill (Bush
2008b; Dering 2004; Goldborer 2002).
The average cupule width of the seven
intact cob fragments from Pine Tree Mound is
5.26 mm. Several examples of wider cupules
were noted during sorting, however. Examples of
ranks with wide cupules and ones with narrow
cupules are shown in Figure B.1. Despite the
lack of intact cob fragments representing widecupule corn, it is the authorâs impression that
two varieties (i.e., cupule widths) of corn are
present in the Pine Tree Mound assemblage.
Although he recognizes the logic
as somewhat circular, Bruce Benz (1994)
recommends that archeobotanists make an
educated guess about which corn types would
have been present at a site and then compare
archeological corn with those varieties. The two
types of cupules illustrated fall on either side of
Bird and Dobbsâs (1986:94) criterion of cupule

Agricultural Products
Corn
Corn is the most common agricultural
product recovered from Pine Tree Mound. A
total of 48.60 g of corn remains were recovered
from flotation samples, and an additional
3.06 g were recovered from point samples.
Most corn is in the form of loose cupules, but
7 intact cob fragments and 1 partial fragment
were recovered (2 from flotation, 6 from point
samples) as well as 134 kernel fragments, all
from flotation. Corn was recovered from 55.1
percent of flotation samples.
The overall ubiquity of 55.1 percent at Pine
Tree Mound fits well within the large range of
reported ubiquity from other Middle and Late
Caddo sites in northeast Texas and northwest
Louisiana (Table B.10). The value for Pine Tree
Mound is somewhat misleading, however, since
the flotation samples include many relatively
small samples from postholes. Corn ubiquities
by feature type are given in Table B.11. The
coefficient of correlation between average sample
size and corn ubiquity (columns 3 and 4) is 0.63,
indicating that larger samples are correlated
with the presence of corn. If Pine Tree Mound is
typical, corn ubiquity is not a particularly good
proxy for corn consumption. Although extremes
of ubiquity (0 or 100 percent) are meaningful,
intermediate ubiquities reflect more about
archeological sampling procedures (and possibly
ancient harvesting and processing techniques)
than the prominence of corn in the local diet.
Attempts to correlate morphological
variation in carbonized corn cobs and kernels
with particular varieties of corn have been
largely inconclusive (Benz 1994; King 1994).
Variation in maize processing techniques and
the processes of preservation, deposition, and

width 8.5 mm as the dividing line between
small and large varieties of Eastern Eight Row,
which is the type expected at Pine Tree Mound
according to Goldborer (2002:85). What, if any,
historically known corn varieties these represent
remains to be determined, however.
The seven intact cob fragments from Pine
Tree Mound consist of three 8-rowed specimens,
two 10-rowed specimens, and two 12-rowed
specimens (Figure B.2). The Pine Tree Mound
corn cannot be distinguished based on the
row number distribution from assemblages at
other northeast Texas Caddo sites such as the
multicomponent Oak Hill Village and George C.
Davis sites, although the small sample size makes
detailed comparison suspect (Table B.14). All

ShaâchahdÃ­nnih site were only 10-row cobs
(although one cob also contained an 8-row
section), suggesting that variability in northeast
Texas corn may have decreased over time, though
again the small sample sizes at both sites make
it hard to say. Farther afield, the Pine Tree
Mound corn is similar in row composition to
assemblages from the Mississippian Moundville
and Angel sites (Scarry 1986; Wagner 1991). It
is distinctly different from samples from Fort
Ancient sites, where 8-row corn makes up 69 to
94 of the assemblages (Wagner 1987:Table 6.3).
Fort Ancient and other northeastern corns are
believed to be the ancestors of historic Northern
Flint corn (Wagner 1987:178â182).
Discussion above has focused on intact cob
fragments. An additional 8,018 loose cupules

and glumes were recovered from flotation, as
were 134 kernel fragments. Kernel-to-cupule
ratios are consistently low for the residential
areas of the siteâ0.01 in Area 2N, 0.02 in
Area 2S and Area 3, and less than 0.01 in Area
8âcompared to the core area at 0.12. These
corn distribution data are considerably more
robust, both theoretically and empirically, than
the corn measurements discussed above. Paul
Welch and Margaret Scarry (1995) point out
that differences in the distribution of kernels
and cupules has significance for ancient social
practice, as it indicates a difference between
corn consumption and corn processing. In the
Moundville settlement system, there is an
inverse correlation between plant processing
waste and high-status sites or locations (Welch
and Scarry 1995:406). A similar pattern can be
seen within the Pine Tree Mound site, where the
kernel to cupule ratio, though less than one, is
between 6 and 12 times higher in the core area
than in all other areas.

at around a.d. 1270 (Hart and Scarry 1999).
Beans are relatively rare at Texas archeological
sites, partly because they appear so late in
time but also because they were not routinely
exposed to fire. Beans dry naturally on the plant
and have no need for parching before storage,
they are usually cooked by boiling, and their
waste products (pods) quickly burn to ash. Fray
Francisco CasaÃ±as de Jesus Maria noted âfive or
six kinds of beansâall of them goodâ in his 1691
report (Hatcher 1927c:211).
Squash
One squash rind fragment was recovered
from Feature 2.030. It represents a domesticated
squash, probably Cucurbita pepo, rather than
the extremely thin and fragile rind of wild
C. foetidissima or C. texana. Squash/gourd
remains are present on archeological sites
in the Eastern Woodlands from the seventh
millennium b.p. (Hart and Sidell 1997) and
were cultivated from at least Late Archaic times
(Smith 1992:42). Squash thus appears to be the
earliest of the three primary crops noted by
early explorers, with corn cultivation second
and beans the most recent, data that have
long been anticipated by linguistic evidence
(Munson 1973).

Beans
Two fragments of common bean were
recovered from Feature 2.068, and two additional
fragments that may be either persimmon or bean
were recovered from Features 2.382 and 2.2018.
AMS dates on common beans indicate their
cultivation in the TehuacÃ¡n valley by 2500 b.p.
and in Tamaulipas by 1300 b.p. (Kaplan and
Lynch 1999). Beans appear relatively late in the
Eastern Woodlands, with the earliest AMS dates

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
on the basis of the cell patterns, especially
in cross section. The outer surface lacks the
cystolith deposits typical of cucurbit gourds
(Peterson and Sidell 1996:Figure 2), and the cell
pattern in cross section matches comparative
specimens and the schematic drawing in Eames
and St. John (1943:Figure 2).
Bottle gourd is native to Africa and was
long believed to have floated to North America
on ocean currents. Recent genetic analysis,
however, has demonstrated that American bottle
gourds are more closely related to Asian bottle
gourds than to African ones (Erickson et al.
2005). Further, the researchers note that AMS
dates for bottle gourds at GuilÃ¡ Naquitz, Mexico,
place their advent in the Americas at 10,000 b.p.
Nearly all bottle gourd populations worldwide
are believed to be domesticated; wild populations
exist only in Africa (Erickson et al. 2005). For
these reasons, Erickson and colleagues conclude
that archeological bottle gourds represent the
fruits of human labor.
Even under domestication, bottle gourd
is not a fussy crop and grows well with only
minimal human inputs (Heiser 1979). Thus
its cultivation is easily incorporated into
hunting and collecting lifeways. Volney Jones
comments on characteristics of the bottle
gourd fruit that would also make it attractive
to early Americans: âThe gourd would be an
extremely useful product to a people without
pottery and dependent on containers of
basketry, bark, and similar products. The
gourd is water tight and adaptable to a wide
variety of uses. To a semi-sedentary hunting
group the gourd would perhaps be of greater
value than pottery and much less troublesome
and confining to produce and use. Providing
that both were available, the gourd might well
have been adopted in preference to potteryâ
(Jones 1936:155).
Frank Speck (1941) demonstrates that in
historic times gourds were more often used as
containers in the southeast and on the Atlantic
coast of the United States northwards to about
New York City. Northern groups used elm and
birch bark for containers and restricted bottle
gourd use to rattles. Both uses of gourds are
documented by early writers in the Caddo area.
Espinosa documented rattles made of gourds
(Swanton 1996:156). The âcalabashâ noted by
CasaÃ±as (Hatcher 1927c:211) probably refers
to a bottle gourd container rather than the

fruit of the calabash tree, Crescentia cujete. The
calabash, a native of Central and South America,
is currently found in the United States only in
extreme south Florida.
Small Seeds
Chenopodium, maygrass, little barley, and
erect knotweed seeds were recovered in flotation
samples from Pine Tree Mound. These grains are
of particular interest to archeologists because
they are part of a complex of native starchy seeds
that were cultivated in parts of the Eastern
Woodlands of North America prior to the advent
of corn agriculture. Amaranth, another of these
small starchy-seeded crops, appears to have been
a later introduction rather than an indigenous
domesticate (Fritz 1990).
Little barley, maygrass, and species of
Chenopodium grow wild in many parts of the
Eastern Woodlands, including modern Harrison
County. Erect knotweedâs distribution is less
clear, but it is probably present in east Texas
under Polygonum aviculare. No changes in seed
attributes associated with intensive cultivation
have been identified for maygrass, erect
knotweed, or little barley (but see Hunter 1992
for some possibilities). Thin seed testa (<20 Âµ) is
an indicator of domestication in Chenopodium
(Smith 1992). Thin seed coats are also associated
with truncate margin morphology (Smith
1995:187). The Chenopodium specimens at Pine
Tree Mound appear to have thick testas and
nontruncate (i.e., saucer-shaped) margins and
therefore represent wild types.
Woodland period cultivation of native
starchy seeds was centered in the central
Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, roughly in
the areas of the later Mississippian and Fort
Ancient cultures (Johannessen 1993:Figure
5-1). Morphological correlates of domestication
appear for Chenopodium by the Late Archaic
(Smith 1992), and the seeds are found in large
quantities on Woodland sites in the American
Bottom. Starchy seed cultivation was either
absent or less important in other areas of the
Eastern Woodlands. Native starchy seeds are
found in low quantities in Late Woodland samples
in west-central Alabama (Scarry 1986), and
they also appear at Moundville, âalthough these
indigenous seed crops were not as important
in the Moundville area as they were in some
other parts of the southeastâ (Welch and Scarry
758

Appendix B: Macrobotanical Analysis
1995:405). In the Lower Mississippi Valley, there
is little evidence of native starchy seed use until
Marksville times, but even then cultivation was
ânot on the scale of their trading partners to the
northâ (Fritz 2000:238). Only in the northern
part of the Lower Mississippi Valley does precorn
cultivation seem to have been important, as at
the Taylor Mounds site in southeastern Arkansas
(Fritz 2000:238). In contrast to the situation in
the Lower Mississippi Valley, the Arkansas River
valley saw intensive cultivation of native seed
crops and, by a.d. 700, the use of maize. Evidence
comes from the Toltec Mounds site associated
with the Plum Bayou culture (Fritz 2000).
The status of native seed crops in northeast
Texas appears more like that of Moundville than
the American Bottom. Sites where maygrass, little
barley, Chenopodium, and knotweed have been
reported are given in Table B.15. The presence
of all four starchy seeds at Pine Tree Mound is
interesting because of the late date of the deposits.
Features 68 and 71, which contained the largest
numbers of starchy seeds, apparently date to the
late a.d. 1400s or early 1500s (see Chapter 2). In
regions where they were intensively cultivated,
the importance of native seed crops waned after
the introduction of corn. Although native starchy
seed cultivation was never terribly important in
northeast Texas, it does seem to have persisted
longer than in the American Bottom. Native seed
cultivation also appears to have continued in the
Lower Mississippi Valley, where historic Nachez
Indians grew what was probably Chenopodium
(Smith 1992).

One nineteenth-century canebrake in Wharton
County is reported to have been 75 miles long
and 1â3 miles wide (Diggs et. al 2006:836). By
1905, James Gow reported that cane was only
locally abundant in swamp, hammock, and
hardwood bottom forests: âDense cane brakes
occur at remote intervals in the bottom lands of
the Sabine and Neches rivers and a few of their
smaller tributaries (Gow 1905:47).â
Native people used cane in many items,
including mats, baskets, screens to divide rooms,
spear shafts, arrow shafts, pipe stems, blow
guns, flutes, and blow tubes used in healing
(Moerman 1998:104). Joutel mentions use of
cane for torches: âThey had lit some dry canes to
see better because they do not have knowledge of
candle-making nor of burning oil (although they
make oil with nuts)â (Foster 1998:235).
Caddo people were particularly famous for
cane mats and baskets. Hidalgo, CasaÃ±as, and
Espinosa all mention baskets or boxes that they
describe as made of reed (Hatcher 1927b:56.
Hatcher 1927a:156). Spanish writers seem to
have used âreedâ (or at least a word translated
into English âreedâ) for various large grass
species. Cane is the more likely identification
here, especially since adjectives such as âbigâ or
âstrongâ modify the plant described. The common
reed, Phragmites australis, was probably only a
minor component of wetlands in ancient times
(Diggs et al. 2006) and would have been more
common nearer the coast than in the Caddo
area. The larger cane baskets in Caddo country
were used to contain crops in storage areas, and
loosely woven baskets were useful in sifting
and winnowing (Swanton 1996:157). Hidalgo
particularly admired the colored cane floor mats,
noting âvery curious rugs of reed of different
colors which could be used in ladiesâ drawing
rooms [in Europe] (Hatcher 1927b:56).â

Fiber Plants
Cane
A total of 448 fragments of cane weighing
3.98 g were recovered from 33 flotation samples
at Pine Tree Mound, for a ubiquity of 19.8 percent.
Approximately half the cane was recovered from
Feature 96, a pit in the high-status cemetery
part of the core area. Cane is the only North
American member of the bamboo tribe, a woody
group of the grass family (Diggs et al. 2006:836).
A facultative wetlands plant, it grows in moist
woods and low areas generally (USDA, NRCS
2008). Although cane is rare today, it was once
far more abundant in east Texas, where it could
occur in dense monocultural stands referred to
as canebrakes (Correll and Johnston 1970:112).

Panicum spp.
Caddo houses are described as thatched
with grass (e.g., Hatcher 1927a:154; Swanton
1996:148â149). Espinosa does not attempt a
species identification for the grass used, but
notes it is âcoarser than the largest wheatâ
(Hatcher 1927a:154). Morfi specifies that the
grass is âthree spans longâ (Swanton 1996:151).
Switchgrass, sometimes called thatch grass,
is quite coarse and reaches a height of 2 m or
more (Diggs et al. 2006:1004). It is also common

in low moist areas and prairies throughout
Texas. The Panicum seeds at Pine Tree Mound
may represent a thatching material such as
switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). All eight
specimens were found in the core area.

One reason hickory trees have been the
focus of speculation regarding cultivation is
that they can be processed far more efficiently
than other types of nuts. Traditional hickory
processing methods used by Iroquois, Choctaws,
Cherokees, and many other peoples involve
pounding hickory nuts into small pieces and
then heating them in water, where the oil can
be skimmed off, the nutmeat retrieved from
suspension, and the shells allowed to sink
to the bottom (Fritz et al. 2001; Moerman
1998:140â141). Experiments by archeologists
show that this process yields a much larger
number of calories per labor invested than does
cracking and picking (Talalay et al. 1984:353).
Other common nuts cannot be processed in this
manner because either their meats float (acorn,
hazelnut) or the nuts become bitter (walnut).
Like most nuts, hickory nutmeat is high in
fat and contains more protein than most plant
foods. These nutrients, particularly the linolenic
fatty acids, may have been critical to huntergatherers who relied on lean meat for a portion
of the year (Gardner 1997; Hall 2000:109â110).
Acorn nuts contain less fat and protein and more
carbohydrates than Juglandaceae nuts (Table
B.16). In this respect, they are more comparable
to grains than to nuts. Acorns require water
processing to leach tannins before they are
palatable to humans, but then can be roasted
and ground into flour (Gremillion 2002). Joutel
was served (but did not enjoy) a dish of acorn
meal cooked in meat broth while staying at a
village between the Angelina and Sabine Rivers
(Foster 1998:234â235).

Wild Food Plants
Nut Resources

A total of 3,884 nutshell fragments
weighing 85.82 g were recovered through
flotation processing. Of this, 3,129 fragments
(80.97 g) are thick-shelled hickory. Acorn, black
walnut, and pecan make up the remainder of
nutshell identifiable to genus. In addition to
the nutshell, three acorn cotyledon fragments
(nutmeats) were recovered from Feature
8.1064. Nutshell was present in 84 percent
of flotation samples. Nutshell ubiquity varies
little by feature type, indicating that, unlike
corn ubiquity, nutshell ubiquity is a reasonably
robust measurement even in small flotation
samples from posts. Ubiquities are between 72
and 87 percent for the three feature types with
more than a few samples. Spatial variation in
nutshell distribution is also minimal, with Area
2N, Area 2S, Area 8, and the core area having
ubiquities between 80 and 88 percent. Pecan
was found only in the core area.
Nut mast is grouped here among the
plant resources that would have been gathered
rather than cultivated, but more than one
authority has suggested the possibility that
hickory trees, in particular, were managed by
aboriginal populations (Albert 2007; Delcourt
and Delcourt 2004; Munson 1986). Creating

open stands of hickory requires only the effort
of girdling nonhickory trees in a particular plot.

distributed, however, present only in two
features, one in Area 3 and the other in Area
2N. As noted above, sumac is a small tree or
shrub that thrives on the edges of forests and
fields. Sumac fruits dry on the plant, where
they often remain available throughout the
winter. Ethnographically, sumac fruits are most
often boiled to make a lemonade-like drink
that is rich in vitamins A and C (Moerman
1998:471â475). The bark and leaves of the
plant have important dye and smoking uses
as well (Knight 1975). Like the sumac wood
discussed above, the sumac seeds at Pine Tree
Mound suggests the presence of abandoned
agricultural fields near the site.

Eight American lotus (Nelumbo lutea)
seedcoat fragments were recovered from three
features at Pine Tree Mound. The immature
seeds of lotus are edible raw or cooked, and
they are high in protein. According to Delana
Tull, the seeds are most attractive for eating
in the spring (Tull 1999:124). The tuberous
roots are a good fall resource and were often
dried for winter use (Gilmore 1991:27). They
can be treated as potatoes and may be the
plant referred to in historical allusions to that
vegetable (Tull 1999:124). Although Hurons
considered them a starvation food, they were
used by many Plains Indians, and ethnographer
Melvin Gilmore found the unique taste delicious
(Gilmore 1991:27; Moerman 1998:353). Gilmore
reports that Plains people believed the plant to
have mystic powers (Gilmore 1991:27â28; Plate
10a). Wiersema (1987) speculates that Native
people expanded the distribution of American
lotus in North America from original locations
confined to major rivers and tributaries. Lotus
may be underrepresented archeologically
because its edible tubers do not preserve well
and because its hard spherical seed coats can
be confused with acorn shell.

Verbena
A total of 25 verbena nutlets were present
in two features in Area 8 at Pine Tree Mound.
Interestingly, nearly all ethnographically known
uses of verbena are for medicine rather than for
food (Moerman 1998:591â592). Decoctions and
infusions of verbena were used to treat a wide
variety of complaints, especially gastrointestinal
disorders and kidney problems. In one intriguing
use, James Herrick records that a cold infusion of
verbena leaves are used âto make an obnoxious
person leaveâ (Herrick 1977:422). A more
mundane use of verbena, though more relevant
to the Pine Tree Mound plants since it specifically
involves seeds, is the recorded use by Native
Americans of Mendocino County to make verbena
pinole (Moerman 1998:592).

Grape Family
Six seeds of Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus
spp.) or grape (Vitis spp.) were recovered from
four features. These close relatives have many
similar uses for medicine, construction and
crafts, and food. The leaves, stems, and roots
of these plants were used in medicine, often
for urinary and dermatological problems
(Moerman 1998:378â379, 598â600). The flexible
vines were valuable in house construction,
basketry, fashioning ropes and cordage, and to
make hoops for uses such as the roll bars on
cradleboards. Grape fruits were used in pink
and purple pigments, but their more important
use was for food. The berries could be eaten
fresh off the vines or dried into raisins for
future consumption. Sap from grapevines was
welcome to travelers for its ready availability
and slightly sweet flavor. Grape leaves served
important uses in cooking, with young grape
leaves holding ingredients in convenient
packages (as in modern Greek dolmas) and
preserving moisture in much the same manner

Eleven fragments of waterlily (Nymphaea
odorata) or pondlily (Nuphar lutea) buds were
found in a Feature 2.1559. Ojibwa Indians used
waterlily buds for food, eating them before they
had opened (Smith 1932:407). The buds at Pine
Tree Mound could also represent waste from
the use of stems. Daniel Moerman found uses
of both waterlily and pondlily stems for pain
relief among Native groups in British Columbia.
The Thompson Indians took a cold decoction of
pondlily stems or roots for internal pain, and
the Okanagan-Colville applied waterlily stems
directly on the tooth for toothaches (Moerman
1998:358, 360). Waterlily and pondlily are
relatives of lotus, and like that plant, their young
seeds and tubers are edible.

as corn husks in todayâs tamales. Among
historical Karok Indians in California, grape
leaves were placed over bulbs to conserve
moisture while the bulbs cooked in earth ovens
(Schenck and Gifford 1952:386). Both Espinosa
and St. Denis commented on the high quality of
east Texas grapes (Swanton 1996:132, 133), and
Texas grapes were later instrumental, through
viticulturalist Thomas Munson, in saving the
European wine industry from the phylloxera
blight (Turner 2009:296).

material (Smith 1932). Radiocarbon dates on
pine cones from 41HS15 clearly indicate they
have ancient origins (see Chapter 4).
Nine other wild plant taxa were recovered
from Pine Tree Mound. These include bramble,
bedstraw, purslane, and miscellaneous grasses.
None are present in quantities of more than two
specimens each.
Historic accounts of Caddo life indicate
other plants that would have been commonly
used at Pine Tree Mound but that were not
recovered. Tobacco, sunflower, sumpweed,
chestnut, groundnut, and âreedâ grass seeds are
mentioned by several authors.
Tobacco seeds are rare in carbonized
archeological assemblages. At around 0.5 mm,
they can slip through all but the smallest heavy
fraction mesh during flotation processing. In
addition, tobacco seeds are unlikely to be exposed
to fire, since the leaves were the part of the plant
used in smoking. The tobacco in use in the Caddo
area was probably Nicotiana rustica, the South
American tobacco found throughout the Eastern
Woodlands by European settlers, or Nicotiana
quadrivalvis, which was found in uncarbonized
plant deposits in Submound 51 at Cahokia
(Pauketat et al. 2002). N. quadrivalvis is native to
the western United States (USDA, NRCS 2008).
Sunflower and sumpweed are oily-seeded
annuals that were sometimes cultivated in
eastern North America along with the four
starchy-seeded native annuals discussed above.
Large seeds indicate domestication (Yarnell
1978). Sunflower is not common on archeological
sites in east Texas, but it does occur, as does
sumpweed. In northeast Texas and northwestern
Louisiana, sunflower has been reported from
Spike, Hurricane Hill, Spider Knoll, and
McLelland. The McLelland sunflower is reported
to be of domesticated size. Sumpweed is reported
from Cobb-Pool, Hurricane Hill, Spider Knoll,
Spoonbill, and McLelland. Sumpweed seeds
at the latter two sites are large enough to be
considered domesticated.
Chinkapin, a species of chestnut, is native
to east Texas and was noted by early explorers
such as Espinosa and Gregg, quoted above.
An acorn relative, chinkapin is nutritionally
similar but has the advantage of fewer tannins,
which eliminates the need for water processing.
Chestnuts can simply be boiled or roasted
before consumption (Moerman 1998:142). Reexamination of the unidentified wood from

Persimmon
One fragment of a persimmon seed was
recovered from Feature 8.196. Two fragments
that may be either common bean or persimmon
were recovered from two other features. The
eastern persimmon (Diospyros virginiana)
trees of east Texas bear fleshy, edible orange
fruit about 3 inches in diameter, smaller than
the modern cultivated persimmon (D. kaki) but
larger than the Texas persimmon (D. texana),
which is black. SolÃ­s mentions persimmon fruits
made into paste and presented as gifts to the
Spanish and French (Swanton 1996:132), and
he describes the tree fruits as coming from
âorchards.â Given the arguments for native tree
cultivation regarding hickories noted above
and the rapid adoption of peaches by Native
Americans of the southeast (Gremillion 1993),
SolÃ­sâs description may be more literal than
metaphorical. Simpson (1999:141) notes a large
population of eastern persimmon trees in the
Canadian River valley that he believes were
planted by Native Americans.
Other Plants
Carbonized pine cone parts were recovered
from 52 of the 167 samples, often in large numbers.
Archaeobotanists have generally considered
pine cone parts incidental introductions
from the frequent fires in pine forests. The
seeds of eastern pines are not edible, and few
ethnographic uses are known for pine cones. The
best-documented economic use of pine cones is in
smudge pits, which is known historically (Hilger
2008:131â132; Skibo and Schiffer 2008:Chapter
4) and may be represented at the Pine Cone
site in Red River County, Texas (Fritz 2008). In
addition, Ojibwas boiled the pitch from eastern
white pine (Pinus strobus) cones for caulking
763

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
41HS846, a Caddo site 1 km south of Pine Tree
Mound that was tested in 2005 (Gadus et al.
2006), resulted in an identification of chinkapin,
so chinkapin nuts would have been available to
the Pine Tree Mound inhabitants. Chinkapin
wood has also been identified at the Henry M
site in Nacogdoches County (41NA60).
Use of roots or tubers for food is mentioned
by CasaÃ±as and de LÃ©on (Swanton 1996:134).
âWild sweet potatoâ would be a species of
Ipomoea, the genus that includes domestic sweet
potatoes. Several species of Ipomoea are common
in east Texas, including I. pandurata, which
is still known as wild potato and was used by
Cherokee Indians for food (Moerman 1998:275).
Another common edible tuber is groundnut,
Apios americana, which was served to de LÃ©on.
Groundnut prefers moist areas such as damp
woods and streambanks, where the plants are
easily recognizable by their dark red-brown
flowers. The tuber is reported to taste somewhat
like a cross between a peanut and a white
potato (Cheatham et al. 1995:388; Reynolds
et al. 1990). Groundnut is higher in protein
than many roots, being about 11â18 percent
protein (Cheatham et al. 1995; Reynolds et al.
1990). Tubers of groundnut can be eaten raw,
roasted, or boiled. Native Americans also dried
the tubers, allowing them to be used outside the
season of collection. Sometimes the dried tubers
were ground into flour (Moerman 1998:77, 381â
382; Tull 1999: 84â87). Groundnut formed a
large portion of Mary Rowlandsonâs diet during
the late winter and spring of 1675, when she
was held captive by a New England Algonkian
group (Rowlandson 1997).
Morfi describes use of a particular kind
of wild grain: âWhen their crops fail them,
they gather the seeds of reeds, which is the
same size as that of wheat, and when it is
well parched, it contains much nourishmentâ
(Swanton 1996:134). Botanist Charles Allen
(2009) has recently proposed that this plant
is giant cutgrass (Zizanopsis miliacea), also
known as water millet. Cutgrass is a member
of the rice tribe (Oryzeae) of the grass family
(Poaceae). Of the 12 genera in this tribe, only 2
are native to North America; the other is wildrice
(Zizania spp.), which was and is widely used for
food. Although Morfi names the plant he saw a
reed, cutgrass is more widespread in the Caddo
area (Diggs et al. 2006). Cutgrass panicles are
generally more open than those of the reed, but

they are roughly comparable, and cutgrassâs size
matches that of the reed described by Morfi. In
addition, cutgrass ripens in late summer and
fall, so its seed could function as a replacement
for an unanticipated loss of crops.
Cutgrass seeds are quite large, more than 2
mm in uncarbonized form (USDA, NCRS 2008).
No grass seed this large was recovered from Pine
Tree Mound, but an unidentified large grass
seed has been recovered from other Caddo sites,
notably Spiro (Fritz 1989:78). Identification of
the Spiro grass could shed light on the plant
described by Morfi and Espinosa.
SUMMARY
Many botanical samples from Pine
Tree Mound represent secondary or tertiary
deposition and contain site debris that is largely
similar throughout the residential areas. Posts
from Overlook house, which apparently burned
in situ, are a clear exception. The construction
material for the posts in Overlook house was
red oak.
Most wood charcoal from the site reflects
fuel collected from the local environment,
which was an oak-hickory-shortleaf pine forest
at the time of site occupation. Woods from
deciduous-loblolly pine forests and riparian
areas are minor components of the wood
charcoal assemblage. Sumac wood represents
exploitation of abandoned agricultural fields in
the local area.
Crop plants recovered at Pine Tree Mound
consist of corn, bean, squash, and gourd. Corn
ubiquity is variable in the Caddo area. At
55.1 percent, Pine Tree Mound is not unusual
and is nearly identical to the Middle Caddo
component at Oak Hill Village (41RK214). The
seven intact corn cob pieces recovered from
Pine Tree Mound consist of three 8-row cobs
and two each of 10- and 12-row cobs. Cupules
on the cobs are slightly larger than those from
Oak Hill village and smaller than those from
ShaâchahdÃ­nnih but are generally comparable.
Subjective examination indicates two types of
corn present at Pine Tree Mound, one with wide
cupules (9â10 mm) and the other with narrow
cupules (5â6 mm). Only the narrow-cupule type
is represented by intact cob fragments, however.
The starchy seeded annuals maygrass,
Chenopodium, little barley, and erect knotweed
were present at Pine Tree Mound in small
764

Appendix B: Macrobotanical Analysis
quantities. Nonetheless, each of these seeds
(except little barley) outnumbers all other small
seeds with the exception of sumac and verbena,
which were concentrated in just two features
each. The presence of these starchy-seeded
annuals to the exclusion of most other seeds,
coupled with the fact that these seeds were
cultivated elsewhere in the Eastern Woodlands,
indicates they were culturally significant plants
even during the Late Caddo period. Although
Caddo sites in northeast Texas typically contain
one or two of these plants, Pine Tree Mound is
unusual in having all four, possibly because
debris from ceremonial areas is well represented
in the analysis.
At Pine Tree Mound, plant remains from
the core area differ from those in the household
areas in several respects. First, they contain
larger quantities of starchy-seeded annuals.
In addition, the corn kernel to cupule ratio is
significantly higher, reflecting a lower proportion
of plant-processing waste. Finally, pecan
nutshell was recovered only from the core area.
The Pine Tree Mound macrobotanical
remains are an important contribution to the
growing database on Caddo uses of plants in
northeast Texas. They indicate use of the local
environment for fuel, construction materials,
and wild plants as well as participation in
agricultural trends of the wider Caddo area and
the greater Southeast. Use of starchy-seeded
annuals in the ceremonial precinct suggests
that these plants may have had continued
significance in northeast Texas even after they
ceased to appear in botanical assemblages
elsewhere. Further research should focus on
clarifying plant use trajectories in Caddo Texas.

using an analytical balance. Both vials were
sealed prior to irradiation. Standards made from
National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST)-certified standard reference materials of
SRM-1633a (coal fly ash) and SRM-688 (basalt
rock) were similarly prepared, as were qualitycontrol samples of SRM-278 (obsidian rock) and
Ohio red clay (a standard developed for in-house
applications).

This report describes the preparation,
analysis, and interpretation of 142 pottery
samples from the Pine Tree Mound site; 2 raw
clay samples, 1 from Pine Tree Mound and 1 from
site 41HS588, also are included. The samples
analyzed are primarily ceramics associated with
Caddo burials. The goals of the research were to
examine the internal compositional variability of
the samples and to compare them to the larger
east Texas Caddo database and the entire University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR)
ceramic database. Internal variability was examined with regard to several descriptive categories
including context, type, motif, and temper.
MURR has a large sample of data from
Caddo ceramics from east Texas, primarily
submitted by Tim Perttula. However, this region
exhibits remarkable uniformity in raw clay composition over vast areas, and this uniformity in
the chemical composition of the raw materials
has limited the potential for neutron activation
analysis (NAA) to distinguish likely ceramic
production locations. The current samples fit
the usual Caddo pattern of minimal patterned
variability, but we were able to develop three
distinct compositional groups that exhibit some
interesting patterns, particularly with regard to
recovery location.

IrrADIAtIoN AND GAmmA-rAy
SPECtroSCoPy
Neutron activation analysis of ceramics at
MURR, which consists of two irradiations and
a total of three gamma counts, constitutes a superset of the procedures used at most other NAA
laboratories (Glascock 1992; Neff 1992, 2000). As
discussed in detail by Glascock (1992), a short irradiation is performed using the pneumatic tube
irradiation system. Samples in the polyvials are
sequentially irradiated, two at a time, for five
seconds by a neutron flux of 8 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1.
The 720-second count yields gamma spectra
containing peaks for nine short-lived elements:
aluminum (Al), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), dysprosium (Dy), potassium (K), manganese (Mn),
sodium (Na), titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V).
The samples are encapsulated in quartz vials
and are subjected to a 24-hour irradiation at a
neutron flux of 5 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1. This long irradiation is analogous to the single irradiation
performed at most other laboratories. After the
long irradiation, samples decay for seven days
and then are counted for 1,800 seconds (the
âmiddle countâ) on a high-resolution germanium detector coupled to an automatic sample
changer. The middle count yields determinations
of seven medium half-life elements, namely
arsenic (As), lanthanum (La), lutetium (Lu),
neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), uranium (U),
and ytterbium (Yb). After an additional three- or
four-week decay, a final count of 8,500 seconds
is carried out on each sample. The latter measurement yields the following 17 long half-life
elements: cerium (Ce), cobalt (Co), chromium
(Cr), cesium (Cs), europium (Eu), iron (Fe), hafnium (Hf), nickel (Ni), rubidium (Rb), antimony
(Sb), scandium (Sc), strontium (Sr), tantalum
(Ta), terbium (Tb), thorium (Th), zinc (Zn), and
zirconium (Zr). The element concentration data
from the three measurements are tabulated in
parts per million.

SAmPlE PrEPArAtIoN
Pottery and clay samples were prepared
for INAA using procedures standard at MURR.
Fragments of about 1 cm2 were removed from
each sample and abraded using a silicon carbide
burr to remove glaze, slip, paint, and adhering
soil, thereby reducing the risk of measuring contamination. The samples were washed in deionized water and allowed to dry in the laboratory.
Once dry, the individual sherds were ground to
powder in an agate mortar to homogenize the
samples. Archival samples were retained from
each sherd (when possible) for future research.
Two analytical samples were prepared from
each source specimen. Portions of approximately
150 mg of powder were weighed into clean highdensity polyethylene vials used for short irradiations at MURR. Another 200 mg of each sample
was weighed into clean high-purity quartz vials
used for long irradiations. Individual sample
weights were recorded to the nearest 0.01 mg

restricted sources. For lithic materials such as
obsidian, basalt, and cryptocrystalline silicates
(e.g., chert, flint, or jasper), raw material samples
are frequently collected from known outcrops or
secondary deposits, and the compositional data
obtained on the samples is used to define the
source localities or boundaries. The locations
of sources can also be inferred by comparing
unknown specimens (i.e., ceramic artifacts) to
knowns (i.e., clay samples) or by indirect methods such as the âcriterion of abundanceâ (Bishop
et al. 1992) or by arguments based on geological
and sedimentological characteristics (e.g., Steponaitis et al. 1996). The ubiquity of ceramic raw
materials usually makes it impossible to sample
all potential âsourcesâ intensively enough to
create groups of knowns to which unknowns
can be compared. Lithic sources tend to be more
localized and compositionally homogeneous in
the case of obsidian or compositionally heterogeneous as is the case for most cherts.
Compositional groups can be viewed as
âcenters of massâ in the compositional hyperspace described by the measured elemental
data. Groups are characterized by the locations
of their centroids and the unique relationships
(i.e., correlations) between the elements. Decisions about whether to assign a specimen to a
particular compositional group are based on the
overall probability that the measured concentrations for the specimen could have been obtained
from that group.
Initial hypotheses about source-related
subgroups in the compositional data can be derived from noncompositional information (e.g.,
archeological context, decorative attributes, etc.)
or from application of various pattern-recognition techniques to the multivariate chemical
data. Some of the pattern recognition techniques
that have been used to investigate archeological
data sets are cluster analysis (CA), principal
components analysis (PCA), and discriminant
analysis (DA). Each of the techniques has its
own advantages and disadvantages, which may
depend upon the types and quantity of data
available for interpretation.
The variables (measured elements) in archeological and geological data sets are often
correlated and frequently large in number.
This makes handling and interpreting patterns
within the data difficult. Therefore, it is often
useful to transform the original variables into
a smaller set of uncorrelated variables to make

The analyses at MURR, described above,
produced elemental concentration values for
33 elements in most of the analyzed samples.
Data for Ni in many samples was below detection limits (as is the norm for most New World
ceramics) and was removed from consideration
during the statistical analysis. Calcium levels
were found to be high enough (up to 7.4 percent)
in many specimens to require a calcium correction of the data set. Because calcium has the
potential to affect (dilute) the concentrations
of other elements in the analysis, all samples
were mathematically corrected to compensate
for any possible calcium-included effects (the
data were examined before and after calcium
correction, and the results were similar). The following mathematical correction, which has been
proven effective in other calcium-rich data sets,
was used (Cogswell et al. 1998:64; Steponaitis
et al. 1996):

e' =

106 e
106 â 2.5c

where eâ is the corrected concentration of a given
element in parts per million (ppm), e is the measured concentration of that element in ppm, and
c is the concentration of elemental calcium in
ppm. After the calcium correction, calcium was
generally removed from the statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis was subsequently carried
out on the remaining 31 elements using base-10
logarithms of concentrations.
Use of log concentrations rather than raw
data compensates for differences in magnitude
between the major elements, such as calcium,
and trace elements, such as the rare earth or
lanthanide elements (REEs). Transformation
to base-10 logarithms also yields a more normal
distribution for many trace elements.
The interpretation of compositional data
obtained from the analysis of archeological
materials is discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g.,
Baxter and Buck 2000; Bieber et al. 1976; Bishop
and Neff 1989; Glascock 1992; Harbottle 1976;
Neff 2000) and will only be summarized here.
The main goal of data analysis is to identify distinct homogeneous groups within the analytical
database. Based on the provenance postulate of
Weigand et al. (1977), different chemical groups
may be assumed to represent geographically
776

Appendix C: INAA of Ceramic and Clay Samples
data interpretation easier. Of the above-mentioned pattern recognition techniques, PCA is
a technique that transforms the data from the
original correlated variables into uncorrelated
variables most easily.
PCA creates a new set of reference axes arranged in decreasing order of variance subsumed.
The individual principal components (PCs) are
linear combinations of the original variables. The
data can be displayed on combinations of the new
axes, just as they can be displayed on the original
elemental concentration axes. PCA can be used
in a pure pattern-recognition mode, i.e., to search
for subgroups in an undifferentiated data set,
or in a more evaluative mode, i.e., to assess the
coherence of hypothetical groups suggested by
other criteria. Generally, compositional differences between specimens can be expected to be
larger for specimens in different groups than for
specimens in the same group, and this implies
that groups should be detectable as distinct
areas of high point density on plots of the first
few components. It is well known that PCA of
chemical data is scale-dependent (Mardia et al.
1979), and analyses tend to be dominated by those
elements or isotopes for which the concentrations
are relatively large. This is yet another reason for
the log transformation of the data.
One frequently exploited strength of PCA,
discussed by Baxter (1992), Baxter and Buck
(2000), and Neff (1994, 2002), is that it can
be applied as a simultaneous R- and Q-mode
technique, with both variables (elements) and
objects (individual analyzed samples) displayed
on the same set of PC reference axes. A plot using the first two PCs as axes is usually the best
possible two-dimensional representation of the
correlation or variance-covariance structure
within the data set. Small angles between the
vectors from the origin to variable coordinates
indicate strong positive correlation; angles at 90Â°
indicate no correlation; and angles close to 180Â°
indicate strong negative correlation. Likewise,
a plot of sample coordinates on these same axes
will be the best two-dimensional representation
of Euclidean relations among the samples in logconcentration space (if the PCA was based on
the variance-covariance matrix) or standardized
log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on
the correlation matrix). Displaying both objects
and variables on the same plot makes it possible
to observe the contributions of specific elements
to group separation and to the distinctive shapes

of the various groups. Such a plot is commonly
referred to as a âbiplotâ in reference to the simultaneous plotting of objects and variables.
The variable interrelationships inferred from
a biplot can be verified directly by inspecting
bivariate elemental concentration plots (note
that a bivariate plot of elemental concentrations
is not a biplot).
Whether a group can be discriminated easily from other groups can be evaluated visually
in two dimensions or statistically in multiple
dimensions. A metric known as the Mahalanobis
distance (or generalized distance) makes it possible to describe the separation between groups
or between individual samples and groups on
multiple dimensions. The Mahalanobis distance
of a specimen from a group centroid (Bieber et al.
1976; Bishop and Neff 1989) is defined by:

Dy2, X = [ y â X ]t I x [ y â X ]
where y is the 1 x m array of logged elemental
concentrations for the specimen of interest, X is
the n x m data matrix of logged concentrations
for the group to which the point is being compared, with X being its 1 x m centroid, and I x
is the inverse of the m x m variance-covariance
matrix of group X. Because Mahalanobis distance takes into account variances and covariances in the multivariate group, it is analogous
to expressing distance from a univariate mean in
standard deviation units. Like standard deviation units, Mahalanobis distances can be converted into probabilities of group membership
for individual specimens. For relatively small
sample sizes, it is appropriate to base probabili2
ties on Hotellingâs T , which is the multivariate
extension of the univariate Studentâs t .
When group sizes are small, Mahalanobis
distance-based probabilities can fluctuate dramatically depending upon whether or not each
specimen is assumed to be a member of the
group to which it is being compared. Harbottle
(1976) calls this phenomenon âstretchabilityâ in
reference to the tendency of an included specimen to stretch the group in the direction of its
own location in elemental concentration space.
This problem can be circumvented by cross-validation, that is, by removing each specimen from
its presumed group before calculating its own
probability of membership (Baxter 1994; Leese
and Main 1994). This is a conservative approach
777

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
to group evaluation that may sometimes exclude
true group members.
Small sample and group sizes place further
constraints on the use of Mahalanobis distance:
with more elements than samples, the group
variance-covariance matrix is singular, thus ren2
dering calculation of I x (and D itself) impossible. Therefore, the dimensionality of the groups
must somehow be reduced. One approach would
be to eliminate elements considered irrelevant
or redundant. The problem with this approach
is that the investigatorâs preconceptions about
which elements should be discriminate may not
be valid. It also squanders the main advantage
of multi-element analysis, namely the capability to measure a large number of elements. An
alternative approach is to calculate Mahalanobis
distances with the scores on PCs extracted from
the variance-covariance or correlation matrix for
the complete data set. This approach entails only
the assumption, entirely reasonable in light of
the above discussion of PCA, that most groupseparating differences should be visible on the
first several PCs. Unless a data set is extremely
complex, containing numerous distinct groups,
using enough components to subsume at least
90 percent of the total variance in the data can
be generally assumed to yield Mahalanobis distances that approximate Mahalanobis distances
in full elemental concentration space.
Lastly, Mahalanobis distance calculations
are also quite useful for handling missing data
(Sayre 1975). When many specimens are analyzed for a large number of elements, it is almost
certain that a few element concentrations will
be missed for some of the specimens. This occurs
most frequently when the concentration for an
element is near the detection limit. Rather than
eliminate the specimen or the element from consideration, it is possible to substitute a missing
value by replacing it with a value that minimizes
the Mahalanobis distance for the specimen from
the group centroid. Thus, those few specimens
that are missing a single concentration value
can still be used in group calculations.

patterning. This difficulty recently led to the
attempt by Jeff Ferguson and Tim Perttula to
reanalyze the entire east Texas Caddo database
(Ferguson et al. 2008). The reanalysis was moderately successful at finding core groups for each
of the 11 subregions that divided the area, but
there was such significant overlap between the
core groups that it is not possible to confidently
assign unknown samples to a likely production
location. The attempt to compare the Pine Tree
Mound data to the east Texas Caddo database
as well as the larger MURR ceramic database is
described below, but first we describe an internal
compositional group analysis that treats the new
data as an isolated sample.
Internal Compositional Groups
We attempted many different means of
developing compositional groups capable of
statistical validation, but most failed to produce
distinct compositional groups. The method that
ultimately produced the best results involved
initial separation of a group exhibiting high hafnium and zirconium (indicative of sand temper
or sandy paste) and then splitting the remaining
samples based primarily on iron concentrations.
These initial groups based on minor separations
in bivariate plots were subjected to a multivariate analysis using Mahalanobis distance projections of the principal components (PCs). The
initial attempts to use PCs did not adequately
separate the groups due to the lack of patterning
in the concentrations of most elements. We have
employed a rarely used technique to enhance
the power of the PCA. Instead of using all the
elements in the calculation of the PC matrix (the
typical procedure), we used a subset of the most
precise elements combined with those showing

best separation of the groups. The final compositional groups were developed through many
rounds of calculating the probabilities of group
membership, removing samples with either low
probabilities of membership in any of the groups
or high probabilities for more than one group,
then projecting the unassigned samples against
the groups and reassigning possible group members. The criteria for group membership are
more inclusive than typically used, but this is a
necessary condition given the minimal patterned
compositional variability in the data set. There
are a number of samples with strong similarities
with a particular compositional group, but they
were left unassigned because their inclusion
in the group reduced the statistical separation
with the other groups. Table C.2 lists the probability of membership for the samples assigned
to Groups 1, 2, and 3.

Groups 2 and 3 are less obvious. They were
initially visually separated in a plot of iron and
chromium and, along with Group 1, further
refined using membership probabilities. Figure
C.3 shows the slight separation between Groups
2 and 3.
The sampling of the elements used in calculating the principal components has caused
the first few PCs to account for an unusually
high percentage of the variance in the data
set. The calculation was further assisted by
the removal of a number of outliers from the
data set used to calculate the PCs. Given the
front-loaded variance distribution, it was not
advisable to use all of the PCs in the calculation
of membership probabilities; however, using
too few reduced the ability to differentiate the
compositional groups. Through trial and error,
we found that the first seven PCs allow for the

reference groups. Thus, CDA can be useful to
determine a general affiliation of unassigned
samples. As shown in Figure C.5, the unassigned
samples are similar to all three groups and do
not show a general preference for one group.
Table C.3 lists the probabilities of membership in each of the compositional groups for the
unassigned samples using the same first seven
principal components used in Table C.2. Samples
are left unassigned for three main reasons:
(1) they have low probability of membership in
all of the groups; (2) they have high probability
of membership in more than one group; or (3) including them in a group reduced the separation
with other groups.

Previous studies in the Caddo region
have had very high percentages of unassigned
samples (up to 50 percent). The unacceptably
high percentages are what inspired the complete
reanalysis of the east Texas Caddo database.
This project has a relatively low unassigned
percentage of 33 percent of the sherds (the two
additional clay samples are also unassigned).
We have accepted slightly less-rigorous requirements for group membership, but this allows for
a greater number of assigned samples without
a dramatic increase in uncertainty in group assignments. Figure C.4 is a plot of the unassigned
samples showing their general similarity to the
compositional groups.
Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) is
similar to PCA in that it focuses on the variability in the data set, but rather than maximizing
the variability between individual samples, CDA
maximizes the variability between established

Clay Samples
The lack of correlation between macroscopically visible aplastics and compositional groups
(described below) is surprising, yet there can be
sufficient compositional contribution from the
additives to severely limit the potential to match
raw clay samples with archeological ceramics.

the descriptive categories in detail.

low probabilities of membership in any of the
groups. Figures C.4 and C.5 both show SWC243
as a distant outlier, but this is almost entirely
due to elevated levels of hafnium and zirconium.
SWC244 is closer to Groups 1 and 2 based on
bivariate plots, but the probabilities are too low
to assign it to either group (see Table C.3). Both
clay samples have sodium concentrations lower
than the artifacts, and this may be the result of
some diagenesis. At this time, it is not possible
to rule out SWC244 as a possible clay source for
Groups 1 and 2.

Pottery Type
Given the great diversity of types in the
study, it is difficult to assess correlations between types and compositional groups unless
the pattern is particularly strong. Of the four
types with more than two samples, it is not
possible to identify any strong correlations except perhaps the greater diversity in the Ripley
Engraved samples. Not only are the Ripley Engraved samples well represented in each group,
there are a high number of unassigned samples.

Descriptive Categories
We examined several categories of descriptive information provided with the samples

tally by compositional group is presented in
Table C.5.

Motif was mentioned in early correspondence about this project as a previously understudied aspect of Caddo ceramics. The interest
was primarily with regard to seeking a pattern
in motifs among the outliers. We have identified
10 samples with significant deviations from the
rest of the assemblage (SWC116, 122, 134, 160,
174, 179, 190, 208, 219, and 225), but these have
varying motifs (1 with concentric circles; 2 with

The temper referred to here is that provided with the samples by Prewitt and Associates, which is not necessarily the same as that
identified through petrographic analysis (see

in compositional groups, but the dominant presence of grog adds understandable complications.
There is very little compositional correlation
between temper type and compositional group
assignment (see Table C.6). Figure C.6 is a plot
of the four major temper types by iron and chromium concentrations. All bivariate plots show a
similar amount of overlap. The only noticeable
pattern is the higher-than-expected percentage
of Group 2 members for the sherds tempered
only with grog. Surprisingly, neither of the sandtempered sherds is assigned to Group 1. Group 1
exhibits high concentrations of hafnium and
zirconium, a strong indicator of sand temper.

initially hoped, with the possible exception of material from the northern portion of the study area
along the Red River. Figure C.7 is the subregional
map used by Ferguson et al. (2008). A few of the
subregions had very few samples, including the
area of the current study, but for most areas there
was a core and one or two smaller groups identified. Unfortunately, almost all of the subregional
core groups almost completely overlap with each
other, with the notable exception of Subregions 1
and 2. To facilitate the comparison with the east
Texas Caddo subregional groups, the Pine Tree
Mound data were calcium corrected, and concentrations for Ni, Sr, and Ca were removed.

Subregions 1 and 2

The location of recovery is the only descriptive category with clear significant patterns by
compositional group (Table C.7). Some of the
recovery contexts have too few samples for valid
comparison, but the Areas 2 and 8 graves, Area
2N village, Area 8 village, and core area (nonmortuary context) all have 11 or more samples.
A chi-square analysis of these samples has a
significant distribution (p = .002, degrees of
freedom = 12). The most obvious patterns are
the abundance of Group 1 and unassigned in
the Area 2 graves and Group 2 in the Area 8
graves.

There are only two of the Pine Tree Mound
samples that consistently plot within the core
group from Subregion 1: SWC220 and SWC226.
The latter of these and SWC130 have strong
similarities with the Subregion 2 core group. All
three of these samples are assigned to Group 2.
Given the general overlap between all of the
subregional core groups, it is not possible to conclude that these three samples were produced
along the Red River, though there is a strong
possibility.
Subregion 3
There are only nine samples within Subregion 3, so we cannot project the Pine Tree Mound
samples against a core group from that area.
However, bivariate plots of the Subregion 3 samples against the compositional groups developed
from the current data set indicate a very strong
relationship between the Subregion 3 sherds
and Group 2 (Figure C.8). This similarity is not

Group 1 also had a large number of members, so
it is included in the comparison as well. These
groups represent the most challenging portion
of the east Texas Caddo database reanalysis
project because of the overlap. At this point, it
is difficult to address how much of this overlap
is due to large-scale similarities in the clay
deposits and how much is a result of exchange
of vessels. As shown in Table C.8, there are almost no Pine Tree Mound samples with a high
probability of membership in only one of these
subregional core groups. Perhaps with further
refinements of the subregional databases, it will
be possible to better isolate the core groups.

too surprising considering that Subregion 3 is
not far to the north, and there is likely general
similarity in the clay compositions as well as
exchange of vessels.
Subregions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
These six subregions are considered together here because they all have very similar
core groups and they all have sufficient numbers
of samples to allow the projection of group membership probabilities using almost all of the elements (Ti and V were dropped to accommodate
two groups with only 27 members). Subregion 7

and

numbers

A Euclidian distance search of the entire
MURR ceramic database revealed several
possible matches, but none were for samples
not already included in the east Texas Caddo
database. These matches included a number
of samples submitted by Tim Perttula, Darrell
Creel, and Katherine Reese-Taylor. The above
subregional comparison is more relevant than a
sample-by-sample comparison, so there is little
more to be learned from the Euclidian distance
data. It is surprising that no samples outside
the Caddo region were compositionally similar
to the samples in this study.

We have identified three compositional
groups among the 142 artifacts analyzed from
the Pine Tree Mound site. These compositional
groups have surprisingly little correlation
with the majority of the descriptive categories
included with the submission of the samples.
The strongest correlation was with the area
of recovery, and there are two areas that each
have a dominance of one of the compositional
groups. One of the two clay samples (SWC244)
is similar to compositional Groups 1 and 2, but
the low probabilities of membership in these
groups make it difficult to identify this as a likely
source for the raw material.
The interpretation of Caddo compositional
data is complicated by three major factors:
(1) the large-scale similarity of raw clays in the
region; (2) the frequent use of grog as temper;
and (3) the likely frequent long-distance trade
of morphologically similar pottery throughout
the region. These factors all contribute to the
difficulty in identifying the areas of production.

Tree Mound samples and the three groups from
Subregion 11 are very similar. There are some
slight differences in concentrations of Ta, Th,
and As.

Prior to this project, Subregion 10 had the
fewest samples (n = 7). Thus there is no core
group established. We have projected the Subregion 10 samples against the three compositional
groups defined for the Pine Tree Mound data
and found some strong probabilities of group
membership. Table C.9 lists these membership probabilities. Samples TKP250, 251, and
254 from 41HS240 and 41HS407 in northern
Harrison County all have high probabilities of
membership in Group 2.

Perhaps reanalysis in light of the ongoing petrographic analysis will illuminate some trends that
will aid our understanding of the compositional
variability of ceramics in the Caddo region.

We acknowledge Mandy Watkins and
Corinne Rosania for their role in preparing the
samples for irradiation.

Appendix D: Petrographic Analysis of Pottery and Clay Samples
INTRODUCTION

analysis alone cannot determine the type of clay
mineral in the sherd because of the refractive
characteristics of clay minerals. Because of these
limitations, petrography is often combined with
x-ray diffraction to obtain a full mineralogical
complement and INAA to obtain a full elemental
complement.
The 144 samples were cut with a wet saw
for the preparation of thin-section slides. The
sherds were sent to Spectrum Petrographics,
where they were embedded in an epoxy
block. The most fragile sherds were vacuum
impregnated and then embedded in an epoxy
block. The block was cut in such a manner that
a thin section measuring 0.03 mm thick resulted.
The resulting thin section allowed the analyst
to identify minerals in the clay paste with the
use of a polarizing microscope.
The polarizing microscope is composed of a
light source, a polarizer, a condenser, a rotatable
stage, an objective, slots for a quartz wedge, an
analyzer, and a Bertrand lens. Light originates
from a light source at the base of the microscope
and passes through the polarizer, which aligns
the light waves in a single plane or direction. The
polarized light then passes through minerals on
the rotatable stage and bends them according
to the mineral structure; each mineral and
inclusion transmits light differently and is thus
identifiable (McLaughlin 1977). The objective
magnifies the resulting light waves, and the
light passes through an analyzer. Analyzers
allow light to vibrate in a plane perpendicular
to that of the first polarizer. When the analyzer
is in place (crossed nicols), birefringence colors
appear and can then be compared to published
charts to identify the mineral. If the crossed
nicol color, angle of extinction, and other
mineralogical characteristics are not sufficient
in the identification of the mineral, the Bertrand
lens and condenser produce interference figures
that determine the mineralâs sign (uniaxial or
biaxial). Interference colors, in addition to the
techniques described above, allow identification
of most minerals.
Thin sectioning provides one objective
means of classifying pottery pastes through the
analysis of mineral size, shape, roundness, and
frequency. Mineral size, shape, and roundness
are established through a comparison of various
graphs and tables (Figures D.1âD.3) (Shackley
1975:44â51). The most common geological
method of determining the quantity of minerals

This report describes the petrography of
142 sherd samples from the Pine Tree Mound
site (41HS15); 2 raw clay samples, 1 from
41HS15 and 1 from 41HS588 about 9.2 km
to the southwest, also are included. Following
descriptions of the methods used in the study
and the paste and temper groups identified is
an interpretation of the INAA data generated
by Ferguson and Glascock (Appendix C to this
report) and the petrographic data. While there
is not a one-to-one correlation between the
chemical and mineralogical data, there are some
interesting results that highlight the need for
combining chemical and petrographic data to
better understand Caddo potting (and possibly
exchange) behavior.
METHODOLOGY
Petrographic analysis allows the analyst
to identify minerals that are present in the
clay pastes of different vessels. Petrography
allows analysis of many clay materials and
inclusions at one time. One can study âthe clay
itself, natural inclusions in the clay, purposefully
added inclusions, and glazes or slips on the clay
surfaceâ (Childs 1989:24).
Petrographic analysis has been adapted
from geological techniques for analyzing
soils and rocks and is useful for archeological
ceramics because, to a large extent, geological
sources differ enough regionally to allow for
comparison of different clays (Blatt 1992).
These methods are applicable to pottery
analysis because pottery can be regarded as
metamorphosed sedimentary rock, since a
sherd is composed of clastic grains imbedded
in a clay paste that has been transformed to
ârockâ through the process of firing (Bishop
et al. 1982; Rice 1987:376). Understanding these
basic principles of geology, plus other principles
of optical mineralogy, allows the description of
pottery pastes and clays.
There are some limitations to petrographic
analysis, however. Thin sectioning may not
produce the full mineralogical composition of
a pottery sample due to sampling error and
because the method of producing thin-section
slides involves grinding and polishing of the
sample (Orton et al. 1993). In addition to
problems with sample preparation, petrographic

in a thin section is point counting. Point counting
determines the number of different minerals
along a predetermined area (for example,
10 mm) of the length and width of the section
(Chayes 1956). Various studies have employed
different methods for counting the frequency of
inclusions: Peacock (1973) uses a random grain
selection; Middleton et al. (1985) use a variation
of systematic sampling along linear transects
with tests of accuracy for different thin-section
samples; and Dickenson and Shutler (1979) use
an area point count (all minerals, inclusions, and
voids are counted in the field of view). Middleton
et al. (1985) compared area counting to standard
geological point counting and determined that
the number of minerals counted was equal,
and the only difference was that area counting
resulted in a smaller mean mineral diameter.
Because mean diameter of minerals is not
critical, and I obtained similar point counts with
standard point counts and area point counts
(tested on 25 sherds of different matrices), I
implemented area counting for a field of view
with 4X magnification (all thin-section images
were taken at 5X magnification).
Before conducting an area count, I scanned
the sherd to determine the range of minerals
and mineral sizes as well as to note any details
of manufacturing techniques and slip thickness.
After determining the types of minerals present,
I counted two standard image areas to ensure
that each area was representative of the sherd
as a whole and to detect changes in the clay
paste. The first counted area was located at
the end of the slide farthest from the rim, and
the second was determined by rolling a die and
moving the slide the corresponding number of
millimeters. For example, if I rolled a 5, I moved
the slide 5 mm and centered the microscope in
an area that filled the standard image. For each
mineral type, I measured the range of mineral
sizes (the smallest and the largest), the relative
frequency as determined by Figure D.1, the
mineral roundness as determined by Figure D.2,
the degree of sorting as determined by Figure
D.3, the number of minerals in the standard
image, the frequency of all the minerals in the
clay paste as determined by Figure D.1, and the
clay birefringence. Other abnormalities were
also noted.

As a result of the point counts, seven basic
paste and temper groups emerged (Table D.1;
see Attachment D.1, at the end of this appendix,
for point counts). These are described below,
accompanied by representative thin section
images. Images of all 144 samples are in
Attachment D.2 (on enclosed CD). All images
were taken in plane, polarized light with 5X
magnification. Each image is a portion of one
of the two fields that was counted for this
analysis. In addition to the differences in pastes,
I observed two general clay paste categories: a
dense homogenous clay fabric, and a coarser
sandy clay fabric. These differences could be
the result of a silt-based clay and a sand-based
clay or the potters sieving the clays to obtain
different fabrics. In general, small quartz
minerals, biotite, iron, plagioclase, and organics
most likely occur because they are part of the
clay body. They are also not too angular, which
may be the result of weathering from the parent
material. Obvious culturally added inclusions
include the angular larger quartz, bone, grog,
and shell.

general, the inclusions in the clay paste are poorly
sorted suggesting that many of the minerals and
other inclusions also were added as temper and
were not naturally occurring in the clay. The
majority of the polycrystalline quartz in these
sherds is not chert. While there is no dominant
sherd color, most are tan or red. The majority of
the sherds in this group are Ripley Engraved and
are from graves in Area 2, and all but 2 are from
decorated vessels. Finally, there are two different
clay fabric consistencies: a dense homogenous
fabric and a coarser (sandy) fabric.

all samples appears in thin section as clear, tan,
and dark reddish brown (possible differences
in kinds of bone or in burning temperatures).
The higher frequency of bone sets Paste Group
2 apart from Paste Group 7. The frequency
notations above for the grog reflect space taken
up in the sherd paste and do not necessarily
reflect count frequencies. The majority of the
grog in these samples is from dark-paste sherds,
although 6 sherds (SWC185, SWC188, SWC212,
SWC215, SWC229, and SWC230) have tan and
dark-paste grog inclusions. The ceramic paste of
SWC212 also contains a piece of grog from a tan
sherd with birefringent clay particles. In general,
sherds with a higher biotite count (2â3 percent)
reflect the differences in clay fabrics. Those with
higher counts tend to have higher birefringent
clay representing the denser clay fabric, while
those with lower counts tend to have a coarser,
sandy clay fabric.
Approximately one-half of the polycrystalline quartz in SWC223, SWC233, SWC212,
SWC114, SWC230, and SWC200 are chert.
Sherds with high organic inclusions tend to
reflect dark pastes that may have been fired
at lower temperatures. The sherd matrices of
this group are poorly to fairly sorted indicating
a mix of naturally occurring minerals in the
clay (mainly quartz, biotite, and polycrystalline
quartz) and culturally added inclusions (bone
and grog). This paste group has a high frequency
of untyped sherds (40 percent), but all of them
are decorated.

temper. Many of the sherd pastes in this group
also have a high frequency of small (fine to
medium) quartz (Figure D.4c), indicating that
these quartz minerals may be natural to the clay
(sandy body). The frequency notations above for
the grog reflect space taken up in the sherd paste
and do not necessarily reflect count frequencies.
Grog colors represent black, tan, tan with
birefringent clay particles, and red-paste sherds.
In two cases (SWC126 and SWC131), a few pieces
of grog are the same paste as the sherd. Sample
SWC138 has a piece of grog with slip.
All of these sherds are either tan or dark
in color. I suspect that if the dark sherds were
fired to 800ÂºC, they would be within the tan
range represented by other sherds in this group.
Interestingly, four slipped sherds are members
of this paste group. Sample SWC138 has a slip
thickness of 0.15 mm, sample SWC161 has a
slip thickness of 0.4 mm, sample SWC192 has
a slip (self-slip) with added quartz of 1.2 mm,
and sample SWC241 has a slip of 0.2 mm. These
slipped samples are characterized by a high
birefringent tan clay.

sherd pastes range in color from tannish-red
to tan to dark tan and have red, dark, and tan
grog inclusions (none have grog of the same
sherd paste). The sherd textures are slightly
different than the other samples submitted
suggesting that these sherds may represent
nonlocal manufacture. Overall, the sherd pastes
are poorly sorted, but the shell inclusions occur
parallel to each other suggesting that the vessels
were manufactured in such a way as to align the
shell in the same direction (molding, paddle and
anvil, etc.). Three of these samples are untyped
and from nonburial contexts in Area 2.

quartz appears to be part of the clay base, as it
demonstrates some degree of sorting and is less
angular (weathering of the parent material to
clay). The larger inclusions of quartz are more
angular and less well sorted and appear to have
been added as temper. All but 2 samples also
have grog temper, and all but 1 have bone. Even
though SWC225 has a high frequency of bone, it
is included in this group because of its bimodal
quartz. This group has the highest number of
different types of inclusions in the sherd pastes.
Each sample contains a mix of polycrystalline
quartz and chert. With the exception of SWC225,
all of the ceramic pastes are tan or dark tan.
Every sample with grog has dark-paste grog
inclusions, and the majority have tan grog
inclusions as well. Samples SWC104, SWC107,
SWC116, SWC119, SWC121, SWC145, and
SWC175 have grog inclusions with the same
kind of fabric as the sherd. Two samples
(SWC102 and SWC103) have grog inclusions
of pottery made from the high birefringent tan
paste. Untyped sherds are well represented in
this group (65 percent). The majority of ollas (67
percent) are in this group.

This paste group (n = 29) represents the
general bone- and grog-tempered sherds of the
collection (Figure D.5c). Four other similar groups
(7a, 7b, 7c, and 7d) are separated out below because
of the presence or absence of some minerals. There
are two different clay textures (as stated above):
(1) a dense homogenous fabric clay base, and (2) a
sandy coarser clay base. There does not appear
to be any preference as to sherd color, although
the majority are tan. Only two samples (SWC149
and SWC201) have grog inclusions made from a
red paste. All but six samples (SWC108, SWC148,
SWC170, SWC196, SWC210, and SWC236)
have grog inclusions made from a tan paste. The
remaining sherds have grog made from both darkpaste and tan-paste sherds. Samples SWC106,
SWC128, and SWC156 are tempered with grog
made from the same clay paste as the sample.
The samples in this group have both chert and
polycrystalline quartz in the paste. The minerals in
these sherds are poorly to fairly sorted, indicating
a good amount of culturally added material
(especially the coarse and very coarse quartz
inclusions) to a clay base. Many of the samples in
this group are Ripley Engraved (48 percent), and
half of the Pease Brushed-Incised samples are
also in this group.

The four members of this paste group are
similar to Paste Group 7, except they do not have
plagioclase or iron inclusions (Figure D.6c). They
have a sandy coarse clay texture and are either
tan or dark tan in color. All samples have grog
made from tan- and dark-paste sherds.

There are 13 samples that are members
of this group (Figure D.5d). The only difference
between this group and the more general one
(Paste Group 7) is the addition of iron in the clay
paste. All sherds have either a tan or red paste.
There is a good mix of types, areas, and forms
within this group.

The best and most obvious correlation
between the petrographic and chemical data
is with CCG 1 and PG 6 (bimodal quartz). Half
of the PG 6 samples assigned to a chemical
composition group are in CCG 1, the group
with high hafnium and zirconium (elements
related to sand). Of the eight samples in this
petrographic group that are not assigned to
a CCG, all but one (SWC105) could belong to
CCG 1, based on the Mahalanobis distance
numbers presented in Table C.3 in Appendix C.
There are nine other samples in CCG 1 that are
in different PGs because of differences in other
minerals and inclusions, even though they all
(but SWC186) have high quartz counts (above
1,500). This indicates that while quartz sand is
an important constituent of the clay paste/fabric,
there are slight differences that reflect human
behavior (the addition of bone and grog temper).
The groups where bone is the only or
predominant temper (PGs 1 and 2) tend to
occur most commonly in CCG 2 (n = 12), but
five samples belong to CCG 1 and five to CCG 3.
The majority of the nine samples in these two
PGs that are not assigned to a CCG could
belong with either CCG 2 or CCG 3, based on
the Mahalanobis distance numbers in Table
C.3. PGs 1 and 2 are petrographically two
very distinct groups with moderate counts of
quartz and polycrystalline quartz (and chert).
Calcium levels are higher with these samples,
but calcium was not used in the chemical
interpretation. These two temper groups again
indicate that, while there is no clear chemical
separation, there is a distinct separation made
based on pottersâ choices and human behavior.
The shell-tempered sherds (PG 4 and
possibly PG 5), which appear to be unlike any
of the other sherds, occur in all of the chemical
groups (one in CCG 1, four in CCG 2, 1 in CCG 3,
and three unassigned). As stated above, I believe
that if calcium, strontium, and other trace
elements were used in the chemical analysis,
these PGs might be distinct. The paste and
temper are unlike the other samples, and shell
tempering is rare in this area. These appear to
be the best cases for nonlocal pottery.
The final major tempering group is grog
alone and grog and bone temper (effectively the
bone temper is ignored in the chemical study
because calcium was not used) and includes PG
3, PG 7, and PGs 7aâd. Of the assigned samples,
the majority (n = 41) are in CCG 2, with 10

The two clay samples could only match
samples with a red paste color because, even
when they were fired to above 800ÂºC, the clay
color never changed from red. There are some
samples (SWC125, SWC144, SWC174, SWC184,
SWC205, SWC207, SWC223, SWC232, and
SWC234) that may have SWC243 as their clay
source, and sample SWC166 may have SWC244
as its clay source.
COMBINING PETROGRAPHIC
AND INAA RESULTS
Ferguson and Glascock (see Appendix
C) divided the 142 sherd samples into three
chemical compositional groups (hereafter CCG)
using 12 elements. According to the principal
component analysis, CCG 1 (n = 16) has higher
concentrations of hafnium and zirconium (the
result of sand); CCG 2 (n = 61) has higher
concentrations of zinc, rubidium, potassium,
and tantalum; and CCG 3 (n = 18) has higher
concentrations of iron, vanadium, scandium,
aluminum, and chromium. Forty-nine samples
were left unassigned. Unfortunately, calcium
was one of the elements that was not used in
the INAA study and could have shed light on
Paste Groups 4 and 5 (shell temper and linear
voids most likely from shell temper). The paste
groups resulting from this petrographic study
are referred to as âPGâ in the discussion that
follows.
824

Appendix D: Petrographic Analysis of Pottery and Clay Samples
samples in CCG 3 and 4 in CCG 1. Twenty-seven
of the samples remained unassigned, but all of
them could go with CCG 2 and CCG 3, based
on the Mahalanobis distance numbers in Table
C.3. Given the degree of overlap between the
two chemical groups, this is not unexpected.
It is also not unexpected that the majority of
samples with grog are part of CCG 2 or CCG 3
because the grog is from sherds that are different
from the main ceramic paste. Therefore, each of
these sherds has chemical signatures from at
least two (and possibly four) different sherds,
making it very difficult, if not impossible, to
separate based on elements. However, this is a
case where petrography may aid the researcher
more with possible divisions that relate to human
behavior. Petrographically, I was able to divide
CCG 2 and CCG 3 into five different groups
that relate to differences in tempering and
possible differences in clay sources. First, while
no overwhelming pattern emerged, I was able
to tell through petrography which sherd pastes
were used for grog tempering. It appears that all
of the pastes analyzed here were used for grog
temper singly or in combination (e.g., tan with
high birefringent clay, red pastes, dark pastes,
and tan pastes with bone temper, etc.) in other
sherd pastes or the same sherd paste. Second,
tempering differences include the absence of
bone (PG 3) or the presence of bone (PGs 7 and
7aâd). Finally, the differences in clay sources (or
the manipulation of clay sources by humans) can
be seen with the differential inclusion of iron or
plagioclase (PGs 7a and 7b, respectively), the
exclusion of biotite ( PG 7c), and the exclusion of
plagioclase and iron (PG 7d), as well as the two
different clay fabrics discussed above. While these
are minor differences, they have the potential to
reflect choices made by Caddo potters.
According to Ferguson and Glascock (see
Appendix C), neither of the clay samples are
statistical members of any of the three CCGs.
This is not unusual as the clays are rarely
âmatchedâ to any chemical group due to the
effects of tempering on chemical composition.
What is different is that the petrographic data
suggest that SWC243 has closer affinities to the
sherd pastes than does SWC244, whereas the
INAA data suggest the opposite. One method
by which to resolve this issue would be to add
the appropriate tempers in the appropriate
quantities to each of the clays and have them
reanalyzed by INAA to see how the chemical

data change. At this time, I would suggest that
both clays are possible sources for some, but not
all, of the samples (see above and Appendix C).
This data set is a perfect example of the need
for petrography to supplement chemical (INAA)
research. Ferguson (see Appendix C; Ferguson
et al. 2008) admits that the Caddo chemical
data set is a challenge to interpret and has
yet to produce any isolated production regions.
Because of the petrographic variability in the
sherd pastes and the lack of obvious chemical
distinctions, this may be an area (similar to
the southwest United States) where extensive
petrographic research is as fruitful as, or more
fruitful than, chemical data research. While I
am not advocating doing away with chemical
compositional research, to better understand
the regional variability, petrographic research
also needs to be conducted.

under plane- and cross-polarized light (100â500x
magnification).
Caran also examined selected pieces of
pigment to determine appropriate methods of
sample preparation and geochemical analysis.
Housh, with the assistance of Nathan R. Miller,
prepared the pigment samples and performed
geochemical analyses by Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and
Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS). In
addition, Housh obtained photomicrographic
images of these samples by Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM, 140â1000x magnification).
Caran and Housh compiled and assessed the
data, but Housh died unexpectedly before this
effort was completed and before one group of
samples, the red pigments, was fully analyzed.
As discussed in this report, the red pigments
had proved particularly resistant to both
conventional and experimental methods of
sample preparation for ICP-MS analysis. The
composition of these samples, was, however,
reasonably well constrained by the EDS
analyses. After further consultation with Gadus,
Caran determined that no additional attempt
would be made to prepare or analyze the red
pigments. Caran wrote the present report, in
part incorporating a brief description of methods
and synopsis of results by Housh.

This report is dedicated to the memory of
Todd B. Housh (1962â2009), an extraordinary
geoscientist and good friend.
INTRODUCTION
Artifacts recovered from Caddo graves at
the Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15), Harrison
County, Texas, include a number of stone ear
spools and pieces of varicolored earthen materials
(pigments). These objects are presumed to have
been property of the deceased or testamentary/
votive offerings from others. Similar artifacts
have been found in association with other
Caddo and Mississippian burials at many
localitiesâe.g., the Tuck Carpenter and Lower
Peach Orchard sites in Texas, Spiro Mounds in
Oklahoma, and various mounds in Arkansas, as
well as locations throughout the Mississippian
and related cultural patronates in other states
(Brown and Brues 1996; Harrington 1920;
Hilliard 2003; Knight 2004; Turner 1992).
To better understand the nature and origin
of these funerary items, we employed a number
of petrological and geochemical methods to
analyze samples from the Pine Tree Mound
site. The objectives of these analyses were to:
(1) characterize selected ear spool and pigment
samples in terms of their lithology, mineralogy,
and major-, minor-, and trace-ion compositions;
(2) define within-sample (or sample group) and
between-sample variations and affinities; and
(3) determine the probable proveniences of the
raw materials from which the samples derived.

EAR SPOOLS FROM THE PINE
TREE MOUND SITE
The staff of Prewitt and Associates selected
four of the six ear spools recovered from the site
for analysis. Staff members gently cleaned the
ear spools to remove all adhering sediment, then
photographed them. All of the ear spools are
the double-flanged type and are asymmetrical
in that the obverse flange (the one that faced
out or away from the body) is larger than the
reverse flange (the one on the back side, or
closest to the body; see Chapter 7 for moredetailed descriptions and illustrations). The
reverse flanges are reduced to a matched pair
of small triangular or semicircular flanges
bracketing the center of the artifact. These
small reverse flanges are weakly to moderately
polished and undecorated. Each obverse flange
is either elaborately carved or smooth and highly
polished on its distal (front) surface, with an

ANALYSES OF EAR SPOOL AND
PIGMENT SAMPLES
All of the samples we analyzed were
collected at the Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15)
during archeological investigations by Prewitt
and Associates. S. Christopher Caran developed
a strategy for analyzing the samples, in
consultation with Todd B. Housh and E. Frances
Gadus, staff archeologist with Prewitt and
Associates. Gadus selected, weighed, and
photographed the samples. She also sorted and
grouped the pigment samples according to color
category: red, yellow, green, and black. Caran
measured and described the ear spool samples
by means of optically unaided examination in

slightly metamorphosed rock, generally enriched
in ferric iron and/or siliceous cement. Bates and
Jackson (1980:34) define argillite as âA compact
rock, derived either from mudstone [claystone
or siltstone] or shale, that has undergone a
somewhat higher degree of induration than
mudstone or shale but is less clearly laminated
than shale and without its fissility, and that lacks
the cleavage distinctive of slate. [Some authors
regard] argillite as a weakly metamorphosed
argillaceous rock, [whereas others define it as]
an argillaceous rock cemented by silica [or] a
claystone composed entirely of clay.â Another
source defines argillites as âHighly indurated
[generally recrystallized] claystones or siltstones
that break into hard, angular fragmentsâ
(Dietrich et al. 1982:AGI Data Sheet 20.1).
In this instance, the rock is a sedimentary
mudstone primarily composed of clay and silt.
Some clays interfere with preparation of thin
sections, which may explain the fact that two
of the thin sections made from these samples
were damaged during production, requiring
an alternate methodology. The noncalcareous
nature of the rock is indicated by an absence of
visible reaction when freshly broken subsamples
were immersed in a 10 percent solution of
hydrochloric acid (i.e., a solution of hydrochloric
acid in deionized water) at room temperature.
Sediment composing this rock was thus lithified
through cementation with a noncarbonate
mineral. Because the rock is hard, it should
be well cemented, yet under petrographic
examination, the amount of interparticle cement
appears to be relatively small. In fine-grained
clastic rocks, cementing minerals are often
dispersed and can be difficult to differentiate
from the sediment. Therefore, it was revealing
to note that the few sand grains and larger
silt grains in these samples are coated with
thin layers of hematite or a related ferric
oxide mineral, which would have served as an
effective cementing agent. The same mineral is
probably distributed throughout the rock and
is responsible for its induration. It is the rockâs
hardness, fine texture, and relative homogeneity
that impart its porcelaneous character and
account for its similarity to a ceramic.

manufactured using only the tools and raw
materials available to the ancient Caddo? Caran
performed a simple test of this hypothesis by
scratching one of the ear spool fragments with

Physical and Mineralogical
Properties
Prewitt and Associates provided us with six
samples from four ear spools, including portions
of two obverse flanges and four reverse flanges.
Thin sections were prepared from fragments of
four flanges from three of the ear spools. Caran
examined the fragments and thin sections at
magnifications of 1â500x under non-polarized,
plane-polarized, and crossed-polarized lighting.
On the basis of these examinations, he defined
the physical properties of the samples and
identified the raw material from which the ear
spools were manufactured. A limited review of
the relevant literature failed to disclose any
previous examples of petrographic investigation
of ear spool composition, but the potential
utility of this technique is obvious. Table E.1 is
a compilation of the linear measurements and
descriptions of the fragments, including their
petrography. Among these properties, color is
surprisingly variable. Caran sought to minimize
the vagaries inherent in color discrimination by
examining the fragments under uniform lighting
conditionsâspecifically, direct solar illumination
with northern sky morning lightâand by
referencing Munsell color standards (Munsell
Color 1994). Exterior surfaces of the cleaned
fragments are strong brown, brown, light brown,
pink, or pinkish gray (7.5YR 5/4 to 7/2) and often
stained. Exposed interior surfaces are brown to
light brown, pink, or pinkish gray (7.5YR 5/4
to 7/4), with regions of strong brown and very
dark gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 3/1) and some irregular
mottling. The range of color variation appears to
suggest differences in composition. Upon further
examination, however, the composition of the
fragments was found to be essentially uniform,
both within each fragment and among the suite
of samples.
Superficially, the fragments resemble
ceramic sherds, but upon microscopic inspection,
all were seen to be composed of a single rock
type: hard, porcelaneous, noncalcareous, slightly
ferruginous, plane- and cross-laminated argillite
containing a few isolated grains of very fine
sand. âArgilliteâ is an informal petrologic and
lithologic term, here defined as an indurated,
noncalcareous, fine-grained, sedimentary or

a chert flake. Argillite is moderately indurated,
but this experiment showed that only minimal
pressure was needed to produce a small but
distinct mark. With a more concerted effort,
argillite could be carved into intricate shapes
using edged chert tools. Chert is a silicate rock
that is significantly harder than the argillite
composing the ear spools. Caddo and other
prehistoric cultures throughout Texas made
extensive use of chert. The flake in our test
was not from a Caddo site but was essentially
identical in lithology to Caddoan chert artifacts.
Bone, antler, or wooden tools may have been
used to finish the carved designs. The fine polish
characteristic of ear spools was perhaps attained
using an abrasive rock such as fine-grained
sandstone or quartzite. These techniques
represent a plausible means of fashioning ear
spools from argillite.

one-day walking distance from 41HS15 include
mudstones analogous to argillite. In particular,
most contain hard ferruginous concretions. A
concretion is a discrete rock or mineral mass
that has undergone differential induration
amid beds of similar or varying composition. In
general, concretions form during lithification,
when aqueous solutions of dissolved minerals
permeated the layers of sediment, but became
concentrated locally, often where there were
pockets of sediment of a different type. The
dissolved minerals precipitated within these
pockets, causing the sediment to form a lithotype
harder than the surrounding rock. Later, when
the strata were exposed, the surrounding rock
eroded more easily, freeing or partly freeing the
concretions. As a result, the durable concretions
accumulated on outcrops or were transported by
streams and deposited in and along channels.
Fe r r u g i n o u s c o n c r e t i o n s f o r m b y
precipitation of one or more ferric oxide
minerals and range from slightly ferruginous
to âironstoneâ concretions containing a very
high percentage of ferric iron. The Eocene
and Paleocene bedrock exposed near 41HS15
contains abundant ferruginous concretions,
which are often lens shaped, similar to the ear
spools and approximately the same size. Ear
spools could also be fashioned from fragments
of ferruginous beds. The origin of a ferruginous
bed is similar to that of a concretion except that
the entire bed became indurated, rather than
an isolated pocket of sediment. Ferruginous
concretions are particularly common in the
Paleocene-Eocene Wilcox Group and Eocene
Sparta Formation. Wherever these strata were
exposed, concretions or pieces of ferruginous
beds would have littered the ground. It is also
possible that raw material could have been
collected from the bed or banks of one or more
of the streams near the site, including Potters
Creek or one of its larger tributaries, Starkey
Creek. Because indurated materials are
resistant to erosion, they often compose much of
the sediment carried by streams. Therefore, even
Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial deposits near
the site might have been the immediate contexts
for procurement, although contiguous exposures
of one or more bedrock units would have been
the ultimate sources. In light of the abundance
of suitable rock types close at hand, importation
of raw materials for ear spool production seems
unlikely. Instead, the argillite probably derived

Provenience of the Lithic
Source Material
One of the objectives of our study was to
identify the probable provenience of the raw
material used to make the ear spools. All the
ear spools we analyzed are composed of argillite,
which was probably collected from a single
stratigraphic context and possibly at the same
geographic locality. The lithology of the ear spool
fragments is not uncommon but does afford a
credible indication of stratigraphic provenience.
We began by assessing the availability of
argillite at or near the site. Harrison County
is in northeastern Texas, where the bedrock is
sedimentary, primarily consisting of interbedded
ferruginous mudstones and sandstones (Pieper
et al. 1965). Table E.2 lists the stratigraphic
units (bedrock and unconsolidated alluvium and
terrace deposits) exposed within a 20-km radius
of 41HS15. This is an estimate of the potential
one-way, straight-line walking distance to or
from the site for the purpose of procuring lithic
resources. Of course, the total distance actually
traveled through irregular terrain would have
exceeded this minimum, perhaps by 25 percent
or more; but inspection of the geological map of
this area shows that even doubling the one-day
trek would not alter the list of stratigraphic
units to which an occupant of 41HS15 had
ready access.
As summarized in Table E.2, most of the
stratigraphic units within the hypothetical

among its subsamples. By defining the withinsample range for each sample, we were able to
make between-sample comparisons: overlaps
in the ranges denoted similarity, whereas
disparities indicated lack of compositional
likeness. We hypothesized that similar samples
may have had a common place of origin, but
in most instances, the within-sample range
of variation was so great that it prevented
meaningful comparisons between samples. A
high degree of heterogeneity is characteristic
of ferric oxide minerals. Precipitation of these
minerals is affected by the presence of organic
matter, types and concentrations of non-ferric
elements, degree of oxidation of the surrounding
rock or sediment, temperature, hydration,
particle size, and many other factors. In addition,
the composition of ferric oxides becomes
unstable once they are exposed to weathering
processes. These complications are not limited to
ochers, because most common pigment-forming
minerals predominantly consist of one or more
ferric oxides.

PIGMENTS FROM THE PINE
TREE MOUND SITE
Archeologists recovered a number of small,
discrete masses of varicolored earthen materials
in the graves at 41HS15. They identified these
materials as âpigments,â noting three colors:
green, red, and black. Some of the pigment
masses were found inside ceramic vessels.
Pieces of pigment were also dispersed through
the grave fills in proximity to skeletal remains
or artifacts but were not contained in vessels.
In an effort to understand the properties of
the pigments, the staff of Prewitt and Associates
contacted Caran regarding the efficacy of
and appropriate methodology for analysis of
selected samples. Caran and colleagues had
previously analyzed the chemistry of ocher from
archeological sites in McCulloch and Taylor
Counties, Texas (Ellis et al. 1997). Caran reviewed
the scant literature then available concerning
ocher chemistry. Typically red- to yellow-colored,
ocher is a weakly to moderately consolidated
lithic material containing various minerals
and mineraloids such as hematite, limonite,
and goethite, which are primarily composed of
ferric oxide or hydrated ferric oxide. Some of the
materials found at 41HS15 could be described as
ocher, but in the present report we continue to
use the term âpigment.â Like ocher, however, each
pigment may consist of a wide variety of earth
materials with divergent mineral and chemical
compositions. In the study reported by Ellis et al.
(1997), we attempted to quantify ocher chemistry
in two ways: within sample and between sample.
We analyzed samples from three sites, dividing
each sample into two or more subsamples to be
analyzed separately. Each analysis determined
the concentration of a selected suite of elements.
We assessed variation or similarity within a
sample by the range of elemental concentrations

Mineralogical and Chemical
Analyses of the Pine Tree
Mound Pigments
Prewitt and Associates staff members
provided four groups of pigment samples for
analysis. Three of the groups are from the fill
of the eastern side of a single grave, Feature
2.2079; one group consists of 4 samples of black
pigment, one group consists of 4 samples of green
pigment, and one group consists of 4 samples of
red pigment. The fourth group of samples consists
of 4 samples of green pigment from the interior of
Vessel 1 from grave Feature 8.1085. Of the 16 total
samples, a representative suite was subjected to
mineralogical or chemical analyses. Four samples
were chosen for EDS analysis, which also involved
SEM imaging: (1) Feature 2.2079, Black, Sample
3 (a, b); (2) Feature 2.2079, Green, Sample 1 (a, b,
c); (3) Feature 2.2079, Red, Sample 3 (a, b); and
(4) Feature 8.1085, Green, Sample 2 (a, b, c).

Editorâs note: This argument ignores the fact that the archeologists who did the work at 41HS15, and
who have extensive experience in the vicinity, have never seen a similar raw material there. Further, these
ear spools were very carefully made by an experienced craftsman. Such artifacts are extremely rare in Texas,
and it is highly unlikely that the person who produced them lived at 41HS15. There are some crude ear spool
examples from village contexts at 41HS15 that may have been made locally, however. It is most likely that the
burial ear spools at 41HS15 came from southwestern Arkansas (see Chapter 9).

836

Appendix E: Petrology and Geochemistry of Ear Spools and Pigments
Analyses were performed at two to three
locations (designated âaâ and âbâ or âa,â âb,â and
âcâ) within each sample. Table E.3 summarizes
the mineral composition of the selected pigment
samples (see Attachment E.1 for a discussion of
methodology and detailed results of the analyses).
The black, green, and red samples recovered from
these graves are primarily composed of organic
carbon, glauconite, and hematite, respectively.
Carbon was actually detected as a minor
constituent but is typically underrepresented
in this type of analysis and is almost certainly
the predominant constituent. This conclusion
was corroborated by the need for a separate step
during the chemical analyses of black pigments to
ensure complete oxidation of carbon (Attachment
E.2). In addition to organic carbon, the black
pigment also contains clay (probably illite) as
well as the detrital minerals quartz, rutile, and
zircon. All of these earth materials are common in
clayey sediment, claystones, and mudstones. Clay
may have been used to form a malleable mass to
bind the carbon (probably powdered charcoal) and
make it easier to handle. Glauconite, a green iron
potassium silicate mineral, is somewhat common
in sedimentary bedrock and can be earthy or
moderately hard. It is the major constituent in all
of the green samples and nominally composes part
of the black sample, although carbon may actually
dominate the latter. The final sample consists
of hematite with clay (probably kaolinite) and
detrital quartz. The mineral hematite is a very
common ferric oxide generally red in color. It may
be hard or earthy. One of the glauconite samples

contains a small amount of hematite. Both may
be found in some outcrops. In fact, all of these
earth materials occur widely and often together.
We chose six samples for chemical analysis
by ICP-MS: (1) Feature 2.2079, Black, Sample 4;
(2) Feature 2.2079, Green, Sample 2; (3) Feature
2.2079, Green, Sample 4; (4) Feature 2.2079,
Red, Sample 4 (not analyzed); (5) Feature
8.1085, Green, Sample 1; and (6) Feature
8.1085, Green, Sample 4. As noted above, Red
Sample 4 from Feature 2.2079 was not analyzed
because it resisted preparation. Specifically,
it would not dissolve in any of the usual
reagents (Attachment E.2). We were exploring
alternative techniques when Housh died.
Following additional consultation with the staff of
Prewitt and Associates, further efforts to analyze
this or other red samples were abandoned. The
EDS analysis of red pigment, which identified its
mineral content and provided a semiquantitative
basis for approximating its major ion chemistry,
was successful, however. The major-, minor-,
and trace-element compositions of the selected
pigment samples are compiled in Table E.4 (see
Attachment E.2 for a discussion of methodology
and detailed results of the analyses). Ion
concentrations reveal both patterns of association
and inherent differences among the samples.
All of the green pigment samples, whether from
Features 2.2079 or 8.1085, are very similar, even
in terms of their minor and trace elements such
as vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt,
nickel, and copper. The chemical composition of
glauconite is evident, especially in the high levels

of iron (an order of magnitude higher than in the
black sample) and potassium (approximately
twice as high as in the black pigment). EDS data
indicate that the black sample contains some
glauconite, but differences between the black and
green pigments are marked. The EDS results
also indicate the probable chemistry of the red
pigments that proved unsuitable for conventional
ICP-MS analysis. As noted previously, the red
pigments contain hematite and could be called
ocher. In their study of ocher chemistry, Ellis et al.
(1997) reported iron concentrations comparable
to several times those in the glauconite samples
from 41HS15. Iron levels in the red pigments
should be at least comparable to those in the
ochers studied previously.

but do provide information for reasonable
interpretation. The clay in our sample is
probably illite, a common clay found in most
of the sedimentary rocks and sediments of the
region. More importantly, glauconite was also
detected in the black pigment and was the major
component in all the green pigments. Many
of the area bedrock units include some beds
of glauconite, but it is common in the Eocene
Weches, Queen City, and Reklaw Formations.
Although Weches crops out only locally within
the area, it is an especially rich source. Queen
City and Reklaw are more widely exposed, and
Queen City also includes beds of lignite. In
contrast, hematite is found in all of the area
strata, wherever ferruginous beds or concretions
are exposed. The red pigment apparently
contained kaolinite, as well. This is a common
clay in eastern Texas but is not the principal clay
mineral in most strata elsewhere in the state.
This supports the inference of local procurement
of pigments, all of which were readily available
to the inhabitants of 41HS15. From the available
information, it is not possible to denote the
exact source area for any of the pigments, but
it is noteworthy that the chemistry of the green
pigments from two graves is almost identical.
A single source may have served the needs of
this community.

Provenience of the Pigment
Source Material
Our investigations identified the principal
components of the three pigments: (1) blackâ
organic carbon, probably ground charcoal, in a
matrix of clay (probably illite) and fine-grained
detrital sediment; (2) greenâglauconite; and
(3) redâhematite. The chemical data reinforce
the results of the mineralogical analyses and
may help to indicate the probable provenience of
the raw materials in each of the pigments. Table
E.2 summarizes the stratigraphy of the region
surrounding 41HS15 and highlights special
constituents of the strata. Organic carbon is
found in charcoal, but also in lignite. The Eocene
Queen City Formation and the Paleocene-Eocene
Wilcox Group encompass extensive lignite
beds, and both lie within the hypothetical
resource procurement area around 41HS15.
The black samples we analyzed appeared to
contain charcoal rather than lignite, but the
Caddo might have used lignite as well. The
other constituent of the black pigment is clay.
EDS analyses generally cannot ensure a wholly
reliable identification of individual clay minerals

CONCLUSIONS
Our investigation met the following
objectives: (1) characterize selected ear spool
and pigment samples in terms of their lithology,
mineralogy, and major-, minor-, and trace-ion
compositions; (2) define within-sample (or
sample group) and between-sample variations
and affinities; and (3) determine possible
proveniences of the raw materials from which
the samples derived.
The ear spools and all pigments are composed
of natural earth materials or combinations of

materials, specifically, argillite and masses of
charcoal-stained clay, glauconite, or hematite.
Minimal preparation was required to render
the pigments suitable for their intended use,
but the ear spools were carved and decorated
with elaborate designs. Similar raw materials
are available within a one-day walking distance
from the site and could have been collected from
the same stratigraphic units and possibly from
the same localities over extended periods.
This study includes a relatively small
number of samples and is to a degree hampered
by a lack of comparative materials from known
geographic and stratigraphic contexts in the
region. To compensate, we utilized advanced
analytical equipment and methods and applied
all available information concerning the lithic
resources of eastern Texas. Our methods are
standard practice in geology, but we found
few examples of similar inquiries in support
of archeological assessments. For example,
we are unaware of any previous petrographic
examination of stone ear spools. Ellis et al. (1997)
conducted chemical analyses of ocher samples,
and Edwards et al. (1998) and Vermilion et al.
(2003) published two recent studies involving
analyses of pigments. Our characterization
of artifacts from 41HS15 serves as a test of
methodology, and we conclude that these
procedures can be applied elsewhere to lend
insight regarding the lifeways of ancient peoples.

Appendix G: Geophysical Investigation
INTRODUCTION

A pipeline appears to cut diagonally across the
eastern portion of Area 8 and was an additional
source of geophysical signal clutter.
The ferruginous sandstone may also be a
source of signal clutter in the magnetic survey
results (although sandstone may also occur in
some archeological features). In an on-site test,
the magnetic remanence of a fist-sized cobble
produced a Â±7-nanotesla (nT) magnetic field
at a distance of approximately 10 cm from the
magnetic gradiometer. By comparison, a burned
piece of daub of comparable size produced a
Â±25-nT field.

Archaeo-Physics, LLC, was contracted
by Prewitt and Associates, Inc., to conduct
a geophysical investigation at the Pine Tree
Mound site (41HS15) in Harrison County, Texas.
Geophysical methods were used to evaluate
two areas of the site slated for data recovery
excavations. The objective of this investigation
was to identify geophysical anomalies and
patterning that indicate the presence of
archeological features or landscape modifications
associated with the Caddo occupation.
Three geophysical methods were employed
during the investigation: magnetic field gradient,
electrical resistance, and ground-penetrating
radar (GPR). Fieldwork was conducted on
February 10â14, 2006.

SURVEY DESIGN AND
TECHNICAL PARAMETERS
An arbitrary coordinate system was
established at each survey area for the purpose
of the geophysical investigation. A 10,050-m2
survey grid was placed using triangulation
with tapes at Area 8. A 2,400-m2 survey grid
was placed at Area 3 using the same methods. A
wooden stake was placed every 30 m within each
grid system. The results of the investigation are
presented in relation to this coordinate system.
Electrical resistance and magnetic field
gradient surveys were conducted over the entire
10,050-m2 survey grid at Area 8 and the entire
2,400-m2 area at Area 3. A smaller 4,875-m2
area of Area 8 was surveyed with the GPR. The
GPR survey area was selected after analyzing
the initial results of the electrical resistance and
magnetic field gradient survey.
A Geoscan Research RM15 resistance
meter operated in twin electrode configuration
was used to perform the resistance survey
(Figure G.2a). The resistance survey was
conducted using a mobile probe spacing of 0.5 m
resulting in a nominal depth of investigation of
approximately 0.5 m. A potential of 40 V and a
current of 1 mA were applied. High-resolution
data were collected at Area 3 using a transect
spacing of 0.5 m, with two samples per meter
along each transect (four samples per m 2).
Medium-resolution data were collected at Area
8 using a transect spacing of 1.0 m, with two
samples per meter along each transect (two
samples per m2). Area 3 was surveyed at a higher
resolution because it was a much smaller area.
It would not have been possible to survey Area
8 at high-resolution data sample densities in
the time that was available for data collection.

SITE SETTING AND FIELD
CONDITIONS
Site 41HS15 occupies a broad upland
surface east of Potters Creek and west of Starkey
Creek, two small tributaries to the Sabine
River. The site is large, comprising some 45
hectares, with a core area that contains three
earthen mounds and eight possible village areas
surrounding this core area. Two of these possible
village areas (Areas 3 and 8) were the subject of
the geophysical investigation. The approximate
locations of the geophysical survey areas are
provided in Figure G.1.
The soils at 41HS15 consist of sandy loams
derived from weathering of Eocene bedrock, with
some likelihood of short-distance transport of
sands by eolian and colluvial processes during
the Holocene. The soils appeared to be relatively
homogenous in the horizontal plain, with some
ferruginous sandstone cobbles visible.
The current ground cover at Areas 3 and
8 consisted of improved-grass pastures (mostly
Bahia grass) without buildings or other serious
obstacles to geophysical data collection. A
barbed-wire fence runs through the southern
portion of Area 8. The geophysical survey grids
were offset 5 m from this fence to minimize
signal clutter.
Both Areas 3 and 8 have been impacted
by late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century
agricultural practices. The sites have been
plowed, and areas used for feeding cattle were
plainly visible on the surface in February 2006.

Appendix G: Geophysical Investigation
Resistance data transects were collected in
a zigzag manner. The resistance survey data
are reported in units of relative resistance (Î©).
These data may be converted to SI units of
apparent resistivity (Î©-m) by using the following
expression:

ï²ï½

2ï°ab( R )
bï­a

ïï­m

where (R) is the relative resistance to be
converted, (a) is the mobile probe separation
distance (a = 0.5 m), and (b) is the remote probe
separation distance (b = 1.0 m).

A zero mean traverse filter, which
compensates for defects caused by
instrument drift and sensor orientation

value were excluded from the transect mean
value calculation.

points in both the x and y directions.

â¢

Lowpass filtering to suppress small-scale
noise and enhance the detectability of

imagery in a manner that would best display
cultural features.

Resistance survey data processing included:
â¢

Removal of extreme statistical outliers.

â¢

Edge matching of data from grid to grid.

â¢

Interpolation to uniform sample densities
in the x and y directions.

â¢

Lowpass filtering to suppress small-scale
noise and enhance the detectability of
cultural patterning.

â¢

Highpass filtering (10-m radius) to suppress
large-scale geologic variation and to enhance
the visibility of small low-contrast anomalies.

â¢

Clipping the data range used to construct
imagery in a manner that would best display
cultural features.

The GPR survey was performed using a
pulseEKKO 1000 ground-penetrating radar
operating at a center frequency of 450 MHz
(Figure G.2c). The data transect interval was
0.5 m, and trace interval (step size) was 0.05 m
(overall data sample density = 40 GPR traces
per m2). Each GPR trace consists of data points
within a 100-nanosecond time window, with
data recorded every 0.2 nanoseconds within
this window, resulting in 500 data points per
trace. GPR data transects were collected in a
unidirectional manner, from south to north.
The radar wave propagation velocity was
estimated at 0.1 m/ns. This is a typical value for
sandy loams; however, it should be noted that the
velocity is an estimate and was not calculated
using common-midpoint (CMP) analysis. The
decision was made in the field to use our limited
field survey time for data collection rather than
CMP velocity analysis.
The GPR survey was designed to facilitate
âtime-sliceâ analysis. Time-slice analysis
calculates the average amplitude of the reflected
radar signal within various time windows for
display as plan view maps. The approximate
depth of these time windows was calculated
using the estimated reflected wave propagation
velocity of 0.1 m/ns. The GPR data are presented
in units of microVolts (mV). The processing
methods applied during the construction of the
GPR time slices are as follows:

The magnetic field gradient survey was
performed using a Geoscan Research FM256
fluxgate gradiometer (Figure G.2b). The FM256
has two fluxgate sensors, separated by 0.5 m. The
recorded data are the differences between the
two sensors (the vertical magnetic gradient). The
instrument was operated in the 0.1-nT sensitivity
range. Data were collected at a relatively highresolution data sample densities in transects
spaced at 0.5 m, with 8 samples per meter along
each transect (16 samples per m2). Magnetic
data transects were collected in a zigzag manner,
meaning the first data transect was collected
from south to north, the second data transect
was collected north to south, and so on. Magnetic
field gradient data are presented in units of
nanoTeslas (nT) in this report by convention.
Multiplication by two is required to convert to
SI units for the magnetic field gradient (nT/m).
Processing of magnetic data included:

Each data transect was cropped to a length
of 30 m.

â¢

A constant time gain was applied.

which tends to emphasize more subtle aspects
of the data set (note: highpass-filtered data also
have a mean value of zero). Extreme values
(those farthest from the mean) are displayed
in color, while values closer to the mean are
displayed in gray scale. It is important to note
that the strongest signal response (those data
farthest from the mean) is not necessarily the
signal of interest in a geophysical survey. The
signal response from archeological features is
often very subtle.
In Figure G.4 the magnetic field gradient
results are presented using two different
displays. The image on the left is constructed
from a broad range of data values. This type
of display allows us to visualize the relative
intensity of the magnetic fields recorded
during the survey, but makes it difficult to
discern subtle detail. The image on the right
is constructed from a narrower range of data
values. This display allows us to identify subtler
(weak intensity) anomalies, but makes it more
difficult to understand the relative intensity of
the magnetic anomalies.
Area 8
The geophysical survey results from Area
8 are presented in Figures G.5, G.6, and G.7.
Figure G.5 presents the results of the electrical
resistance survey, Figure G.6 presents the
results of the magnetic field gradient survey,
and Figure G.7 presents the results of the GPR
survey.
In Figures G.5 and G.6, the data images
are presented using more than one method of
data processing and display, similar to what is
described for Area 3 above. The average relative
resistance value from Area 8 is 53 ohms less than
the average value from Area 3 (see scale bars on
Figures G.5a and G.3a). This suggests a subtle
difference in soils between Areas 3 and 8.
The magnetic field gradient survey results
from Area 8 are significantly different than
the survey results from Area 3. The relative
intensity of magnetic field gradient anomalies
is generally an order of magnitude less than the
magnetic anomalies in Area 3 (see scale bars in
Figures G.4a and G.6a). This will be discussed
in the interpretations section below.
The GPR survey results presented in
6 images in Figure G.7 are intended as an

Area 3
The geophysical survey results from Area 3
are presented in Figures G.3 and G.4. Figure G.3
presents the results of the electrical resistance
survey, and Figure G.4 presents the results of
the magnetic field gradient survey.
The electrical resistance survey results
are presented using two different displays.
Using more than one method of data processing
and display parameters usually conveys more
information than a single static display. On the
left is a âstandardâ display of non-highpassfiltered data. The image is constructed using
data that are three standard deviations from the
mean value. Relatively high electrical resistance
values were arbitrarily assigned darker shades,
while relatively low relative resistance values
were assigned lighter shades. The image on the
right is constructed from highpass-filtered data.
This data processing method attempts to remove

their signal response (or numeric value). When
rendered graphically, we can better recognize
cultural and natural patterns and visualize
the physical phenomena causing the detected
anomalies. Patterning in the geophysical
data can be caused by a number of different
phenomena including archeological features,
modern disturbance (for example, agricultural
plowing, terracing, or application of chemical
fertilizers), and natural changes in soils or
geology.
Interpretation of survey data must be a
cooperative process involving both archeological

INTERPRETATIONS
The results of geophysical surveys of
archeological sites are generally presented
graphically. This is done because anomalies
of cultural origin are generally recognized by
878

Appendix G: Geophysical Investigation
geophysicists and archeologists who are familiar
with the specific cultural context of the site being
studied. An understanding of the geological and
geomorphological context of the survey area is
also very important.
In areas that have been surveyed with
more than one type of instrument, the results
of the different surveys should be carefully
compared. Correlations between data sets (or
lack of correlation) can be as important as either
data set by itself to our interpretation of the site.
The interpretations offered in this report
are preliminary, as they represent only the
initial interpretations of the geophysical
surveyor. Review by archeologists familiar
with the cultural context of the site and
the range of expected feature types and
intrasite patterning may result in different
or elaborated interpretation. Testing these
initial interpretations will be of great benefit.
Verification (or refutation) of preliminary
interpretations and insights into feature
composition and geology can allow us to revise
or elaborate our interpretations, and to do so
with greater confidence.

magnetization. Although less likely, it may
also be possible that these magnetic fields
were created by intensely burned archeological
features. Testing could quickly determine if the
fields are related to archeological features.
Even if the majority of the magnetic fields
in Area 3 are geologic in origin, it still is possible
that archeological signals may be visible above
the clutter. Magnetic fields add and subtract
from one another by vector addition. A strong
magnetic field from a burned archeological
feature would add or subtract from the magnetic
signal due to geology. Two anomalies were
selected as possible examples of this (see those
anomalies circled by dashed red lines). These are
the most intense magnetic anomalies in Area
3, and both have interesting correlates in the
electrical resistance results.
Area 8
Initial interpretations of the geophysical
results from Area 8 are presented in Figures
G.10, G.11, and G.12. The most striking
electrical resistance survey results are the large
oval anomalies perhaps created by modern
agricultural terracing. The central portion of
Area 8 appears to have been largely unaffected
by this, and this region was selected for intensive
investigation by GPR for this reason. A selection
of electrical resistance anomalies are graphically
highlighted and discussed in Figure G.10. In
general, the resistance results from Area 8 are
subtler and more difficult to interpret than those
in Area 3. The electrical resistance survey at
Area 8 was conducted at two samples per square
meter, versus four samples per square meter at
Area 3. This is probably the major factor in the
difference in resistance survey results from the
two areas. It may also be that the depth of the
noncultural overburden is greater at Area 3 than
at Area 8. Both surveys were conducted using a
nominal depth of investigation of 0.5 m.
Magnetic field gradient survey interpretations are presented in Figure G.11. Numerous
small but relatively intense bipolar (containing
both positive and negative components) magnetic fields are present throughout the survey area.
These are typical of small modern metal objects
such as fence staples or wire fence fragments.
Several magnetic anomalies are recommended
for testing. Two bipolar magnetic anomalies of
moderate intensity may have been created by

Area 3
Initial interpretations of the geophysical
results from Area 3 are presented in Figures
G.8 and G.9. In Figure G.8 several electrical
resistance anomalies are graphically highlighted.
This highlighting of possible archeological
features is not meant as an exhaustive list,
but may be considered a list of anomalies that
are recommended for testing. Testing results
can then be used to expand and enhance our
interpretations. An attempt was made to
roughly prioritize the anomalies listed, with
relatively high probabilities at the top of the
key and relatively low-probability anomalies at
the bottom.
The magnetic field gradient survey
interpretations are presented in Figure G.9.
The Area 3 magnetic survey results are
characterized by very intense magnetic fields
throughout much of the survey area. These
intense fields are suspected to have been caused
by nonarcheological phenomena. Possible
natural explanations might include large
concentrations of ferruginous sandstone near the
surface, or perhaps coal fires beneath the surface
that have created significant thermoremanent

burned archeological features or objects. One
relatively weak positive magnetic field may
represent a midden deposit. Several relatively
intense bipolar magnetic fields are located in
the southeast portion of the survey grid. These
anomalies may be caused by geologic phenomena, or they may represent intensely burned archeological features. Field testing of a fist-sized
piece of burned daub from the site determined
that intact burned daub does retain a relatively
strong thermoremanent magnetization.
Several GPR anomalies are recommended
for testing and are presented in Figure G.12.
Two small (5 to 7 m along the long axis) ovoid
anomalies are visible in the 20â30-cmbs image.

These anomalies may represent arrangements
of postmolds. In the 28â30-cmbs image, several
linear anomalies are visible. Some possible
interpretations of these linear anomalies include
lines of postmolds, foot trails, or ditches (perhaps
related to prehistoric agricultural practices).
In the 44â54-cmbs image, two roughly ovoid
shapes are visible in the southern portion of the
GPR survey area. In the northern portion of the
GPR survey area, a very faint linear feature is
visible. Directly adjacent to this linear anomaly
is a strong reflection (circled in yellow) with a
correlate in the electrical resistance results. In
the 64â74-cmbs and 72â82-cmbs images, two
additional poorly defined circular anomalies

are visible. In the 92â102-cmbs image, a smaller
ovoid anomaly becomes visible. This anomaly
appears to lie beneath a general region of ânoisyâ
response. It may be that the noisy response is due
to artifacts and debris, while the ovoid anomaly
was created by postmolds beneath this clutter.

in images deeper than 42â52 cmbs. Trenching
across several of these linear anomalies should
determine their sources. Several ovoid or
circular anomalies are also visible in images at
various depths below surface. These anomalous
patterns tend to be less well defined than the
linear patterning discussed above but are
approximately the dimensions one might expect
for Caddo structures. GPR anomalies associated
with test trenches from previous investigations
at 41HS15 are visible in several of the time-slice
images between 36â46 cmbs and 46â56 cmbs.
These test trenches also appear in the electrical
resistance and magnetic field gradient survey
results, although to a lesser extent.
Large portions of Area 8 appear to be disturbed by agricultural terracing. The signal
response from this terracing is plainly visible in
the electrical resistance imagery. Several electrical resistance anomalies (or anomalous patterns)
are highlighted in this report. Careful testing
should determine the sources of these anomalies.
Magnetic field gradient anomalies over
much of Area 8 are extremely subtle (low
intensity), except in the southeast corner of
the survey area, where a series of very intense
bipolar magnetic anomalies were observed.
Again, anomalies with these characteristics
often are created by a geologic source; however,
it is possible that these signals were created
by intensely burned archeological features.
Carefully trenching across several of these large
anomalies should determine the sources.
The interpretations provided in this report
are intended as a starting point for testing.
The results of testing can be used to produce
increasingly detailed interpretations of these
data. Communication is an essential component
of this iterative interpretative process.
Information concerning feature composition, depth, and geometry will help us better
understand the observed signal response. Additionally, plan maps (in the geophysical coordinate system) and photographs of the final
excavation results will help us interpret future
geophysical survey results in similar soils and
cultural contexts.

SUMMARY AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
The geophysical investigation at 41HS15
has yielded an intriguing array of data images.
Several anomalies of interest in both Areas 3
and 8 are highlighted in this report. Although
the survey identified numerous anomalies
(and anomalous patterns) that may be related
to archeological features, the correlation of
anomalies between methods is generally weak.
Careful testing of a meaningful sample of
anomalies will do much to clarify and improve
our interpretations of these data.
At Area 3, testing several of the 1â2-mdiameter circular electrical resistance lows is
recommended. There are perhaps several dozen
anomalies with these characteristics in Area 3,
some of which appear to form alignments that
may be significant. In like manner, testing several of the smaller electrical resistance highs
that form alignments should clarify whether
these anomalies are significant. Finally, it is
highly recommended that the source of the
very intense bipolar magnetic signal at Area
3 be determined. It is suspected that this signal is geologic in origin, however, some of the
anomalies have intriguing correlations with
the electrical resistance results. Some of these
intense magnetic anomalies also form patterns
that may be archeological. Trenching across
several of these magnetic anomalies should
quickly determine whether burned archeological materials (burned daub, for example) are the
sources of these signals.
At Area 8, perhaps the most intriguing
anomalies are in the GPR survey results.
Complex linear patterning is plainly visible
in the time-slices images, beginning in the
26â36-cmbs image and largely disappearing

major river systems. It is an adaptable mussel,
having been documented at depths ranging from
12 to 15 ft, in large and small streams and rivers,
and in slow- to fast-moving currents. It is found
on many different substrates, from mud to rocks,
although it appears to avoid deep and shifting
sand substrates (Howells et al. 1996:69â70;
Parmalee and Bogan 1998:138).
Megalonaias nervosa (Washboard) is found
in major river systems in central and east Texas.
Considered a large river mussel, it is found in
large, slow-moving, deep rivers on substrates
of mud or gravel, at depths of up to 50 ft. It is
known to be adaptable, having been documented
in medium-sized rivers as well as reservoirs
(Cummings and Mayer 1992:24; Howells et al.
1996:81; Parmalee and Bogan 1998:160).
Potamilus purpuratus (Bleufer) is found
from the Gulf Coast drainages, including the
Guadalupe River Basin, into systems to the
north and east. Documented through central and
east Texas in both small and large streams and
rivers, this species prefers quiet pools or deepwater streams with slow-moving waters. Found
at depths of up to 3 ft, it favors stable substrates
such as mud or mud and gravel (Howells et al.
1996:101; Parmalee and Bogan 1998:201).
Quadrula sp. has been documented
throughout most of Texas. Members of this genus
are typically found on substrates composed of
mixed mud, sand, and gravels, in environments
ranging from still-water reservoirs to mediumsized to large rivers (Cummings and Mayer
1992:26; Howells et al. 1996:112â113).
One small valve, with the umbo missing,
was tentatively identified as a Fingernail Clam
(Family: Sphaeriidae). This single valve is in
excellent condition and retains the majority of
its epidermis. Fingernail clams are found across
Texas and occur in a wide range of habitats
(Howells et al. 1996:167â168).

Freshwater mussels from 41HS15 were
analyzed to provide information on the range
and variety of species found at the site. Analysis
was done using comparative literature, mussel
identification guides, and the Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., comparative collection. Each
shell was identified to the genus and species
level, unless the condition or fragmentary nature
of the shell made confident identification of the
species questionable. A shell was considered
unidentifiable when the fragment was too small,
too fragmentary, or too poorly preserved for a
definite identification. It is important to note that,
since valves were not identified to side (i.e., left or
right), all counts indicate the number of individual
valves rather than a representation of the number
of individual animals present. Each shell was
also examined for any evidence of intentional
modification and indicators of heating or burning.
SPECIES DESCRIPTIONS
With the exception of one valve, all of the
mussel shells analyzed are freshwater mussels
belonging to the family Unionidae (Table H.1).
Information specific to each genus and species
is provided, including common name, range of
occurrence, and preferred habitats. Due to the
poor preservation and eroded state of much of
the sample, very few fragments were identifiable.
While a few of the specimens showed evidence
of heating or burning, the preservation overall
was so poor that it was not possible to draw any
conclusions.
Lampsilis hydiana (Louisiana Fatmucket)
is found from the San Antonio River into
drainage systems to the north and east. It has
also been documented in the Nueces River
system (Howells et al. 1996:65). This species is
found in rivers, streams, and reservoirs, typically
with quiet or slow-moving waters. This species
favors a mud bottom, but also has been found on
other surfaces such as mud and sand substrates
(Cummings and Mayer 1992:150; Howells et al.
1996:66; Parmalee and Bogan 1998:134).
Lampsilis teres (Yellow Sandshell) is
another common Texas species, found in all of the

MODIFIED SHELL
Only one valve showed evidence of possible
modification, associated with Feature 2.1001
from Area 2N. This valve, identified as Potamilus
purpuratus, has a circular hole removed from the
body of the valve, just below the umbo.

Appendix I: LA-ICP-MS Analysis of Gunflints
INTRODUCTION

The data for 36 elements in the three
41HS15 samples (Table I.1) were combined with
previously collected flint data and examined in a
variety of ways to identify projections that would
separate them into source-related groups. The
North American, British, French, and Danish
source areas are reliably discriminated on
several projections. The American-2 group is
relatively high in calcium compared with the
European sources (Figures I.1âI.2). The British
source area is relatively enriched in uranium
compared with the French and Danish groups
(Figures I.3âI.5).
We used calcium-arsenic and calciumthorium to discriminate between European
and American sources. The gunflint artifacts
have lower concentrations of calcium compared
with the American samples, which is consistent
with the European source samples. Due to a
lack of other known American sources, the
American-2 source sample was used in the
analyses (see Figures I.1âI.2). These bivariate
plots demonstrate that the gunflints from
41HS15 are not from the same source as the
American-2 group, and that they are consistent
with European sources. However, a local source
cannot be completely ruled out due to the lack
of flint samples from east Texas for comparison.
The North American compositions are quite
variable, and some of the analyses fall within the
range of variation of the European sources. The
American-2 source samples used in the analysis
are thought to have originated on the east coast
of North America.
To evaluate the probable European
source, we compared the gunflintsâ composition
of uranium-rubidium, uranium-thorium,
and uranium-arsenic with that of British
source samples. Uranium concentrations were
consistent with the relatively high uranium
concentration in the British source samples.
The gunflint artifacts are consistent with the
European sources on these projections of the
data, which is consistent with other projections
of the data (e.g., see Figures I.1âI.2). More
specifically, the uranium-rubidium plot suggests
that the artifacts fall within the range of
variation of the British samples (see Figure
I.3). The uranium-thorium and uranium-arsenic
plots (see Figures I.4 and I.5) also suggest a
strong link to the British sources. Therefore,
the gunflints from 41HS15 are most likely from
British flint sources.

Three gunflints from 41HS15 were analyzed
using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The chemical
compositions of the gunflints were studied to
attempt to identify the sources of the materials.
METHODS AND RESULTS
The analysis was conducted in the
archaeometry laboratory at the Institute for
Integrated Research in Materials, Environments,
and Society (IIRMES) of California State
University Long Beach, on the GBC Optimass
8000 time-of-flight ICP-MS, with the New
Wave UP-213 laser ablation system used for
sample introduction. Lines of approximately
0.5 mm in length were scanned with the laser
set at 80 percent power and a 100-micron spot
size. Because all elements except silicon were
present in very low concentrations, signal
intensities for 46 elements were monitored in
a single pass, with the instrument tuned for
maximum sensitivity. The minor isotope of
silicon, silicon-29, was monitored and used as
an internal standard.
The LA-ICP-MS data were calibrated to
parts per million using Little Glass Butte obsidian
and SRM 614 and 612 glass; concentrations
below 1 ppm for most elements in the SRM
614 give us a better basis for calibrating
very low concentrations detected in flints.
The basic approach involves fitting standard
concentrations (ratios to silicon) in standards
to standardized counts (ratio of raw counts to
raw aluminum counts). The data were calibrated
to concentrations by converting the standard
counts to standard oxide concentrations and
summing to 100 percent.
Flint and cherts present several challenges
for chemistry-based source determination.
First, they tend to be nearly pure silica, with
trace impurities close to or below detection
limits. Second, even with sensitive analytical
techniques, such as INAA or ICP-MS, the trace
impurities tend to be quite variable. Although
some studies have found consistent chemical
differences between formations (Hoard et al.
1993; Malyk-Selivanova et al. 1998), others
have concluded that source determination on a
useful geographic scale was not possible (Cacker
et al. 1999).

INTRODUCTION

CERAMICS

The excavations at 41HS15 yielded a modest
collection of historic and modern materials
(Table M.1). Historic materials (n = 194) include
ceramics, glass, and metal. These materials were
categorized first by material and, when possible,
by function.1 The majority of the metal artifacts
are corroded beyond recognition of any function,
and only minimal information could be obtained.
Modern materials (n = 13) are limited to glass,
an aluminum pull-tab, a piece of wire, melted
plastic, a roofing nail head, and a key.

Transferware
Fourteen sherds are transfer-printed wares.
Transfer-printed wares were common in the
Texas markets from roughly 1820 through the
1870s (Blake and Freeman 1998:15), with purple
and black transfers emerging in the mid to late
1820s and falling out of production in the 1840s.
Monochromes were the mainstay, but bichrome
designs were also produced (Pollan et. al.
1996:7). Since purple and black are represented

Thanks to Sandra and Johnney Pollan for their assistance with ceramics identification and dating and
to Aaron Norment for his help with the ammunition assemblage.

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
in the assemblage, it was thought that the
sherds may represent one bichrome vessel.
However, bichrome transfers were commonly
on the interior or central scene rather than the
edge pattern, and since there are both purple
and black rims, a bichrome transfer is unlikely.
The assemblage is impressive in that, for
such a small collection, both purple and black
colors are represented, as are multiple rims
and foot rings, as well as an importerâs mark.
These characteristics help narrow the dates of
manufacture and thus the deposition dates for
these artifacts.
Twelve sherds with purple transfer
printing were collected. Of these, 2 are rims, 1
is a foot, 1 is a facet, 1 is a base (as indicated
by an importerâs mark; see below), and the
remainder are body or base fragments. Four
have decoration (transferred) on both sides. The
rim fragments do not appear to be scalloped;
however, both are small and could be shallowly
scalloped. Diameter is difficult to discern, but 1
rim sherd is 220 mm in diameter, suggesting a
medium-sized plate, soup plate, or bowl. Purple
transferware has a mean beginning and end
production range of 1827â1838 (Sandra and
Johnney Pollan, personal communication 2010;
Samford 1997:20). Sandra and Johnney Pollan
(personal communication 2010) identified
two designs on these sherds: âSupplemental
Unascribed Genre #2â with a production
range of 1827â1838, and âChinese Birdsâ with
a production range of 1836â1849. One sherd
bears a mark with the letters âORL.â This is
an importerâs mark of Henderson and Gains, a
New Orleansâbased importer and wholesaler
in business from 1836 to 1866 (Black and
Brandimarte 1987). This mark is especially
informative because the company name is
misspelled. Instead of stamping the correct
spelling of the name âGains,â the mark reads
âGaines.â Pollan et al. (1996:26â27) attribute
this particular misspelled mark to importation
from 1836 to 1837.
Two sherds have black transfer prints. One
is a scalloped rim sherd with decoration on the
interior. The diameter is ca. 120 to 140 mm.
This appears to be a small plate rim fragment
such as a saucer. The second fragment is a body
sherd with decoration on both sides and may be a
creamer (such as the one depicted by Pollan et al.
[1996:9, Figure 7]. Like purple transferware,
black transferware has a mean beginning and

end production range of 1827â1838 (Sandra and
Johnney Pollan, personal communication 2010;
Samford 1997:20). Sandra and Johnney Pollan
(personal communication 2010) identified one
design called âThe Sower, Tooâ with production
ranging from 1820 to 1838. The design on the
second sherd could not be identified.
Edgeware
Three edgeware rim sherds were collected.
Two are from a common leafy pattern, and
the third represents a second, plainer, morelinear pattern. Additional pieces of edgeware
may be included in the whiteware category,
since lacking any rim decoration the source
of whiteware cannot be linked to one of the
edgeware vessels. Sandra and Johnney Pollan
(personal communication 2010) identified these
as three styles of green-colored edgeware:
(1) even scalloped with curved lines, with
production dating from 1802 to 1832 (Miller
1989); (2) even scallop, impressed bud, with
production dating from 1813 to 1834 (Miller
1989); and (3) unscalloped, impressed pattern,
with production dating from 1841 to 1857.
Undecorated Whiteware
Thirteen sherds are undecorated whiteware.
The majority are flat (probably the base of
a plate). Two exceptions are angular pieces
(indicative of a plate foot), and others are curved
pieces. One of the latter is a probable shoulder
curve and has an estimated diameter of 250 mm,
suggesting a large plate, platter, lid, tray, or
low bowl. The second, somewhat twisted, sherd
cannot be identified as to body location.
Stoneware
Stoneware collected from 41HS15 includes
three distinct brown-glazed sherds, two
industrial- or slipped-ware sherds, and one
salt-glazed sherd.
Brown-Glazed
Three brown-glazed stoneware body sherds
were recovered. One has a cream-colored paste
with few tiny iron-like inclusions. The glaze is a
hard, reflective (vitrified) medium brown (7.5YR
4/3) and has a faintly pitted texture, but it does
932

Appendix M: Historic and Modern Materials
not have the characteristic orange-peel texture
of salt glaze. The interior of the sherd is similar
in color but has no pits and instead has a slightly
granular or gritty texture. Wheel-thrown rings
are distinct on the interior of the sherd.
The second sherd is very small (1.3 mm) and
thin (3.6 mm). The paste is light grayish brown,
and the glaze is very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3)
on the exterior and dark reddish brown (2.5YR
2.5/4) on the interior. The surface of the glaze is
somewhat reflective and granular or gritty on
both sides of the sherd.
The third sherd is small (1.7 mm) and thick
(9.5 mm). The paste is white (10YR 8/1), and
the glaze is very shiny dark brown (7.5YR 3/2)
on both the interior and exterior, although the
exterior shows much more wear (i.e., is slightly
dull). This most closely resembles Albany in
its dark brown color but is slipped on both the
interior and exterior surfaces. Though probably
not actually an Albany slip, vessels were slipped
on both surfaces after 1875 and through ca. 1915
(Johnney Pollan, personal communication 2010;
Greer 1981:264).

of black, bright cobalt blue, and white. Much
of the slip has chipped off. The second smaller
fragment is a rim. A creamy white slip adorns
the rim followed by a deep chocolate brown.
Salt-Glazed
One sherd of salt-glazed stoneware was
recovered. The paste is a cream color, and the
glaze is grayish light brown (10YR 7/1â8/1) on
both sides. The sherd is relatively thick (7.6 mm).
Salt glazes began in Germany in the sixteenth
century (Barber 1906) but were not common as
fine tablewares until the 1720s (Carpentier and
Rickard 2001:76). Texas-made salt-glazed wares
were very common in the nineteenth century
with several kilns in operation near San Antonio
(Greer and Black 1971). A potter by the name
of Taylor Brown was working in Rusk County
as early as 1839, and 15 more potters were in
business from San Antonio to northeast Texas
during the following decades (Texas Antiques
2010).
Earthenware

Industrial Ware

One sherd is either an earthenware or a
poorly fired stoneware. The paste scratches with
a metal knife tip but does not chip or break. This
body sherd does not appear to be wheel thrown,
and its uneven interior surface suggests paddle
and anvil construction. The paste is pinkish gray
to light brown (7.5YR 6/2 to 6/3) with large (0.5â
1.4 mm) angular inclusions (possibly ferrous).
The interior surface has no treatment. A faint
slip is seen on a sliver of the exterior surface and
is light brown (7.5YR 6/3). Decoration consists
of dark reddish brown slip (5YR 3/3) that runs
perpendicular to the curvature of the sherd, i.e.,
a vertically running painted slip. Thickness is
7.3 mm.
This sherd does not appear to be European
or Native American and may be Mexican or early
Texas in origin. No comparable ceramics were
found in publications relating to the Spanish
missionization of Texas (Fox and Ulrich 2008;
Tunnell and Newcomb 1969).

Two sherds fall under the slipped, dipped,
or industrial ware category. Industrial ware is
a relatively recent term encompassing slipped
and dipped stoneware for mass-produced British
ceramics produced from the second half of the
eighteenth century through the late nineteenth
century. These hand-slipped vessels were
decorated with various styles such as banded
lines (also called annular wares), ink-like fluid
called mocha wares, and âdiptâ or dipped wares
(Carpentier and Rickard 2001:115â134). In 1811,
the invention of a three-chambered slip cup
enabled multiple colors of slip to be applied at
once. By the 1830s, this three-colored technique
was common, and multicolored dots (called catâs
eyes) and lines of dots (called cables) became
popular in the 1850s (Carpentier and Rickard
2001:126â128). Many other forms of decoration
splintered off of these styles. Miller (1991:7)
states that most dipped wares were uncommon
after the 1840s, giving the catâs eye a rough
general production range of 1830â1840.
Both fragments are split horizontally,
leaving only portions of the decorated surfaces.
On one, the background slip color is soft neutral
green and is overlain with a distinct catâs eye

Kaolin Pipe
One kaolin pipe bowl fragment was
recovered. A molded decorative rope design
runs vertically along the bowl, continuing up to
933

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
the rim. Kaolin pipes were common throughout
the nineteenth century (NoÃ«l Hume 1982:120),
but there are no attributes that help determine
a date of use. The bowl has a rough diameter
of 20 mm.

embossed with some code, but it is very faint
and illegible. The bottle glass is in immaculate
condition (in contrast to the heavy weathering
of the Prosser button, for example).
Dark Olive Green

Button

Nine fragments of very dark green glass
were recovered. The pieces are fairly thick
and highly etched or pitted. Three pieces have
sharp and deep linear striations similar to
crazing lines. These may represent possible
stress impressions, or possibly resulted from
linear bubbles that burst. The surface texture
of these pieces is rough, similar to etching,
possibly a result of the acidic soil. Very dark
green container glass is considered to be some
the oldest glass found in Texas and is common
in assemblages dating back to the Spanish
colonization of Texas in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. Durable dark green
glass was produced extensively from the mid
seventeenth to mid nineteenth centuries.

One four-hole Prosser button was recovered.
Prosser buttons, also called agate or âsmall
chinas,â were created by intensely heating
packed fine clay and quartz to a temperature
that resulted in a ceramic âapproaching or
even achieving the level of porcelainâ (Sprague
2002:111â112). According to Sprague (2002:111),
âThe introduction of the Prosser button is one
of the most precisely dateable events in the
area of common personal items and gives an
excellent terminus post quem of 1840.â The
Prosser technique of manufacture is still used
today, and there are few, if any, attributes that
can illuminate the date of manufacture of a
Prosser button.
The very worn white four-hole button is
10.3 mm in diameter and 2.6 mm thick. The
surface is pitted or etched extensively, and onequarter of the button has been broken away,
showing no evidence of recent breaking. Both
faces of the button are somewhat elliptical
(rounded), and a circular dip is in the central
portion of the front face.
Buttons are commonly lost and therefore do
not hold much chronological value as far as date
of deposit. This example could have fallen off the
shirt of a farmer, rancher, or passerby anytime
from 1840 to present. However, etching on both
surfaces suggests that it has been exposed to
the acidic sandy soils of the site for some time.

Pale Olive Green
Two pale olive green fragments were
recovered. Their curvature suggests some type
of container, such as a beverage bottle. The glass
is in excellent condition and, based on this, may
not be very old.
Amber
Six fragments of amber bottle glass were
recovered. These are separate from the modern
beer bottle fragments included with the modern
materials, based primarily on the thickness and
shape of the fragments. All six pieces may be
portions of snuff bottles. One is a portion of a
neck indicative of the mouth of a snuff bottle,
and another is a snuff bottle base. A rough
circular suction scar indicates manufacture by
the Owens automatic bottle machine between
1905/1910 and the 1920s. The Historic Glass
Bottle Identification website explains that âa
very roughly cut-off suction scarâ¦ is usually the
product of an earlier Owens machine, i.e., 1905
to maybe the mid to late 1920s, though suction
scars with some minor roughness are commonly
seen on bottles made into the 1930sâ (Lindsey
2010:Bottle Dating).

GLASS
Colorless
Thirty fragments of colorless glass were
recovered, including one partial bottle. Of the
fragments, 5 are flat and 12 are highly etched.
Clear glass became popular in the United
States in the 1920s (Lindsey 2010:Colors). The
partial rectangular panel bottle has a portion
of one panel with âRMICK & COâ embossed
on it. McCormick and Company, which makes
spices and food flavors, started in 1889 and was
incorporated in 1903. The base of the bottle is
934

Appendix M: Historic and Modern Materials
Aqua

use continues even today. One linear corroded
blob included here is 5 cm long and 12 mm in
diameter with a distinct head-like platform at
one end. Based on its girth, it may have been a
bolt or thick screw rather than a nail.

Three glass fragments are aqua. One is
embossed with the letters âU Sâ. The glass
shows some evidence of wear and slight etching
on the surface. Aqua-colored glass bottles were
very common from the early nineteenth century
through the 1920s and served as several types
of containers, including the very common âBallâ
fruit jars that were popular from 1909 through
the 1930s (Lindsey 2010:Colors). Colorless
bottles replaced aqua in popularity in the
1920sâ1930s (Lindsey 2010:Colors).

Utensil Handle
One utensil handle is a highly corroded
piece of flat metal measuring 8.5 cm long. The
functioning end has broken off, leaving only the
handle with its rounded end. This piece is very
dense and has a slight curvature, suggesting
that it may have served as a large knife handle.

Solarized (Purple)

Farm-Related Artifacts and
Fence Staples

Two fragments of solarized glass were
collected. These could date as early as the 1820s
or as late as the 1930s (Lindsey 2010:Colors),
âalthough the large majority of bottles made
with manganese decolorized glass were made
between about 1890 and 1920â (Lindsey
2010:Colors).

Three pieces of metal and three fence
staples are categorized as farm-related artifacts.
One is a linear piece roughly 8 cm long with a
nail-like head at one end and a circular ball at
the other. This may be some sort of tractor part
or possibly horse tack. The second is a thick
wire roughly 11 cm long with an eye at one end.
This probably served as a gate latch. The third
is a linchpin, 5 cm in diameter. The three fence
staples are highly corroded.

Milk Glass
Two fragments are milk glass. Both are very
small (less than 1.5 cm). One is thick and may
be a base fragment. The second is very thin and
embossed with a possible leaf motif. Cosmetics
and toiletry bottles were commonly made of milk
glass from the 1870s to 1920, and ointment/
cream jars were common from the 1890s to the
mid twentieth century (Lindsey 2010:Colors).
Milk glass bottles were fairly rare prior to ca.
1870, thus milk glass bottle fragments âwould
not commonly be found on historic sites that date
totally prior to the 1870sâ (Lindsey 2010:Bottle
Dating).

Ammunition
Three artifacts are in the ammunition
category. These include two brass heads from
shotgun shells and one lead projectile. Both
shotgun shell heads lack the plastic casing
remnants indicative of modern shells. This does
not help much in dating them, since plastic
replaced paper casings in the 1960sâ1970s. One
shell head is imprinted with âWINCHESTER
REPEATINGâ and â12,â indicating a 12-gauge
shotgun shell. The Winchester Repeating Arms
Company started marketing shotgun shells in
the 1870s (Farrar 2006). The second bears some
imprinting but is too corroded to read. One spent
or fired lead projectile was collected; it has faint
texture indicative of cloth impressions and may
be the result of a patched ball.

METAL
Nails
Eight heavily corroded linear pieces of
metal are identified as nails. Only one of these
can be identified as a cut nail, and a second one
probably is. Cut nails were manufactured as
early as 1807 but did not become commonplace
until 1830; they can account for 95 percent
of the nails on sites between 1850 and 1883
(Adams 2002:80). However, they were accessible
much later in rural parts of the state, and their

Wire, Metal Can Fragments,

Some artifacts are grouped together
because they offer very little in the way
935

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
of dating or depositional chronology. Two
pieces of wire were recovered from a single
provenience, and metal fragments from cans
total 75. No distinguishing marks or seams
were identified on the fragmentary pieces.
There are 6 unidentified corroded metal blobs.
One is triangular with a height of roughly 5 cm
and a base 3.2 cm. The piece is highly uneven
but reaches a maximum thickness of 15 mm.
Another piece is dense and small but appears to
have been broken recently. A third is rectangular,
measuring roughly 5.5x2.5 cm and just under
10 mm thick. Another unidentified piece is a
dense, linear rod-like piece measuring 8 cm long
and just under 20 mm in diameter. One side is
somewhat flat, while two sides seem somewhat
rounded, creating a triangle-like shaft. The piece
tapers slightly.

Native Americans were in this area during
the nineteenth century, with several hundred
immigrant Cherokees in what is today Rusk
County by 1830 (Cliff and Sills 2004:3). Cliff and
Sills (2004:7) note that a trading post to serve the
Cherokee was on Martin Creek near present-day
Tatum, just 20â25 km southwest of 41HS15, by
1833. Their excavations at 41RK305, a possible
trading house ca. 33 km southwest of 41HS15,
show that historic artifacts comparable to some
of those found at 41HS15 were present in the
area by the early to mid nineteenth century. Site
41RK305 yielded a large collection of non-Native
ceramics (n = 4,600, including annular or banded
ware, shell-edge ware (mostly blue, but also
green), a variety of transferwares, spatterware,
hand-painted ware, salt-glazed stoneware,
and alkaline-glazed stoneware); 3,100 glass
bottle fragments, many with pontil marks;
16 glass beads; 260 clothing-related items; 49
furniture-related items; 275 firearms-related
artifacts (mostly lead balls and percussion
caps, but including 3 gunflints); 2,280 cut nails
and numerous pieces of clay chinking; many
animal bones and eggshell fragments; and 56
personal items, including 47 clay pipe fragments
(Cliff and Sills 2004:4â7). The collection from
41RK305 is far richer and more varied than that
from 41HS15, and thus the occupations appear
to have been quite different. But with trading
houses such as 41RK305 nearby, whoever
occupied 41HS15 in the early to mid 1800s,
Native or not, clearly had access to the kinds of
materials recovered.
One possible interpretation of the Pine Tree
Mound site historic component arises from its
proximity to Trammelâs Trace, which ran along
the ridge east of Starkey Creek about 2 km
from Area 2 (Fields 2008:4). Nicholas Trammel
established a horse trail from Nacogdoches up
to the Red River beginning in 1813, and in 1824
the path was improved for wagons, opening
up this part of Texas for settlers (Pirtle 2010).
This route, following the ancient Caddo Hasinai
Trace, was well trafficked by both Native and
non-Native peoples during the first half of the
nineteenth century and played an important
role in the movement of both people and goods
into northeast Texas. Given the nature of the
artifact assemblage from 41HS15, it may be
that the historic materials (at least the earlier
ones) represent campsites created by travelers
on the Trace.

DISCUSSION
The vast majority of the historic artifacts,
97 percent, are from Area 2, with 82 percent
of those from Area 2N (see Table M.1). Thus,
whatever activities these materials represent
occurred predominantly in that part of the site.
Some of the artifactsâmost of the glass
and metal, for exampleâprobably relate to use
of the area during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, but most of the ceramics,
the kaolin pipe, the dark olive green glass, and
maybe the button appear to indicate earlier use,
perhaps in the 1830sâ1840s. It seems unlikely
that the assemblage represents a continuous
residential occupation, i.e., a farmstead, over
this span, though, because artifact densities
are so low and architectural artifacts (such
as large quantities of nails, hinges, bricks,
and furniture-related pieces) are so sparse. Of
course, it is possible that a house was present
near the excavated area but outside it, or a
structure could have been moved, leaving only
trash deposits.
One possibility suggested by the recovery of
gunflints made of local materials (see Chapter
7) is that the assemblage represents a very late
Native American occupation. This interpretation
is not supported well by the data, however. As
noted in Chapter 4, the gunflints have a slightly
different distribution across the site than the
other historic artifacts, and while they would
be consistent with the early ceramics, that
is not true for the later artifacts. Certainly,

Appendix N: Review Comments on the Draft Report
EDIToRâS PREfACE

p. 81: What is the 2 sigma pooled mean of the
Zone 12 dates? I am not sure how it was determined that this zone was deposited ca. 14601480 when the 1 sigma age range is 1442-1512
(about a 53 percent chance it falls in that range
at 1 sigma) and the 2 sigma range is 1432-1527
(about a 66 percent chance it falls in that range
at 2 sigma)?

Timothy K. Perttula was kind enough to
review the draft of the report on the excavations
at the Pine Tree Mound site and provide both
substantive and editorial comments. In preparing the final report, we addressed many of his
comments but did not make changes in response
to others, either because we disagree with him
or feel that the kinds of changes he suggests are
beyond the scope of what we could do. With Timâs
permission, we are including his substantive
comments here because we think it is worthwhile to air opinions that vary. His specific page,
paragraph, and line number references have
been changed to reflect final pagination.

p. 127: I am wondering why if the trouble was
taken to recover, clean, and examine remains
from Feature 136, why they were only documented cursorily?
p. 127: pits may be associated with cooking activities associated with Caddo 6 day ceremony,
where food is brought to the grave for six days
until the soul departs for the House of Dead
in the sky (see discussion of Caddo burial ceremonies by Gonzalez [2005], in Gonzalez et al.
2005)

Substantive Comments:
p. 1: I suggest that instead of using 41HS15
throughout the text of the volume, that you use
Pine Tree Pine Mound. I think the name works
better than the number. Was the recommendation made that the site was eligible for NRHP
listing or inclusion?

p. 156: Be careful about assuming that the occurrence of a ceramic pipe means ritual activities. Schambach made that proposal years ago,
despite abundant evidence the pipes and pipe
sherds are common in both domestic and nondomestic parts of Caddo sites. A pipe does not a
ritual area make.

p. 2: You might mention that the Nadaco Caddo
were later known as the Anadarko Caddo.
Figure 1.4: Could add the core area boundaries
to this figure.

p. 174: Is it important to establish the relative
importance of above-ground or below-ground
storage at the Pine Tree Mound?

p. 10: The Lorrain (1967) reference is not evidence of Pineywoods Caddo faunal use. There
must be more pertinent references that can be
used.

p. 184: discussion might be in order to explain
why we should believe that Mississippian
connections are important. Maybe the most
important connections are with other Caddo
communities?

p. 23: Would it be possible to explain why the fill
from excavated features was not screened during
the test excavations?

p. 190: or perhaps that burned fill from a house
ended up in a post hole?

p. 24: Could the text be expanded to explain how
it was determined that only 90 of 202 features
from the testing to excavated in sufficient detail
during the test excavations?

p. 192: It might be useful here for reader orientation purposes to provide a map showing the
different named house complexes. I am curious
how it was decided to name these different house
complexes?

p. 77: It is interesting that there appear to
have been marker posts in Mound B, given the
evidence for marker post use in mounds at the
contemporaneous Pilgrimâs Pride and Ear Spool
sites.

p. 203: pine cones and corn may have been used
as fuels, but mainly for the purpose of producing
large amounts of smoke, not a heating fire.

941

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
p. 206, 648: the radiocarbon assay has clearly
been contaminated by atomic carbon (as seen
by the modern age range of 1939-1951), so I do
not think you can parse out the other age ranges
and try to suggest they may be relevant to interpreting ages of occupations that may date to
the 17th and 18th centuries.

larly since the Caddo believe that the essence of
the deceased person in the grave is commingled
with the dirt in the grave?

p. 206, 355, 360: I do not really follow the reasoning regarding F2.068 and Feature 2.167, nor
does it seem to offer a convincing interpretation
for the 2nd scenario.

Figure 5.3, p. 314, etc: I think it is an excellent
idea to include small drawings of the vessels,
showing their form and decoration, on the burial
plans. However, some of the vessel drawings are
rather faint.

p. 314: I think appendices by Wilson and Bush
should be added as chapters into the final report,
instead of relegated to appendices.

p. 207: 0.15 g of wood charcoal does not strike
me as âwell representedâ

p. 318: ââ¦like that of Poynor or Hume Engraved.â

p. 192, 278-279: excellent point regarding the
smaller posts used at Pine Tree, thus likely to
have needed replacement in a shorter period
of time than houses with larger posts, as at
Deshazo. Why do you think that the Pine Tree
Caddo built their houses with smaller posts?
Could there have been a depletion of timbers
around the site?

p. 324: four peaked bowls ought to be identified
as compound bowls here, and elsewhere in this
chapter.
p. 331: what sort of graveside ritual is suspected
to be associated with the green pigment in vessels or in pigment masses (or for that matter, the
Perdiz points mentioned on p. 260 for Feature
2.2079)? Why does it have to be a graveside
ritual, as opposed to a ritual associated with the
burial itself (i.e., pigments placed in the graves
because they were needed in the after life)?

p. 284: I understand why you want to use the
one-sigma age ranges, but given the generally
low probabilities of the various cited ranges for
Areas 2, 3, and 8, the dates charted as having
even moderate or high probabilities are really
low probability dates; 0.68 at the highest probability at one-sigma still means there is only
44% chance that the date falls within that range.
Maybe you only chart the high probability range
of the 2 sigma dates to most accurately portray
temporal uses.

p. 334: I am dubious of the Cass Appliqued identification of Vessel 6, based on the drawing.
p. 348: The charcoal staining certainly constitutes evidence of fire, most likely associated
with the fires during the 6 day ceremony held
by the Caddo, where food was burned in or near
the graves of deceased. Since it has not been
established that the staining is actually a black
pigment, I think the text is pushing the evidence
a bit far to use it to conclude an âascribed statusâ
for the deceased in this case.

p. 302: what is the one Paleoindian form found
at the site?
p. 303: The P/DR values of 0.44-0.58 and the 7683% brushed from different areas of the site all
suggest that the ceramics are contemporaneous.
None of these values are consistent with the suggestion that the Area 8 occupation would have
started in the 1300s; the percentage of brushing
just strikes me as much too high for that to be
a reasonable option.

p. 351: I am dubious of the Avery Engraved
identification of Vessel 1, based on the drawing,
especially if it is not shell-tempered.
p. 364: I generally think of Cass, Cowhide,
Hodges, and Taylor as post-A.D. 1500 types,
which is consistent with their appearance in
the Belcher phase and various sites throughout
Northeast Texas.

p. 311: what there any particular depth or location within the grave where these soil samples
were taken? Was any consideration given to
retaining a larger sample of burial fill, particu942

p. 364: It would be useful to define and/or illustrate what is meant by the SZ element here, to
help the reader follow the discussion.

trated there. This would help the reader follow
the discussion.
p. 383: Can you discuss I more detail the importance of the Ramey Incised analogy with Ripley
Engraved ? Iâm wondering what it has to do with
the interpretation of the control of the imagery
on Ripley Engraved vessels. Is it not possible
that the Ripley vessels also provide important
links to other related communities (since these
motifs are wide ranging outside of the Pine Tree
community)?

p. 367: I think you could revise the text to make
clear that the ranges in population are for any
point in time. Nevertheless, the population sizes
seem too small for the number of houses in the
different areas, some of which must have been
contemporaneous.
p. 367: the southeast-northwest orientation is
also characterize of south of the Sabine River
Caddo (Hasinai) groups, as at Deshazo and Lake
Naconiche, and sites like 41HS574 and 41HS524
on the Sabine itself. The connectedness to these
Caddo is just as strong, if not more so, that it
is to Caddo groups below the Great Bend of the
Red River. The Caddo burials at the Hatchel
siteâabove the Great Bendâare also oriented
southeast-northwest.

p. 383, 385: I think it is dangerous to rely to
heavily on the ethnographic record to make
statements about the political-religious system
at Pine Tree as compared to the Hasinai. I think
that the Pine Tree community, with its platform
mounds, large plazas, and shaft tombs, was
organized at a higher and more complex political-religious level than the Hasinai of the late
17th-early 18th century. The ethnographic record
documents nothing comparable to what is seen
at Pine Tree, or at other multiple mound centers
in East Texas.

p. 367, 369: Could not the astronomical factors
relate to the beliefs of the Caddo about where the
House of the Dead was located in the sky, rather
than sunrise explanations? Or that astronomical
alignments are not pertinent?

Table 6.1 would be even more useful if the vessels were specifically linked to the iconographic
elements (Great Serpent, Thunderer, etc.).

p. 374: Perhaps these high-status individuals
were lineage heads, and their death initiated
cemetery formation? The same argument has
been made for some Titus phase cemeteries
where possible âlineage headsâ were centrally
placed, and the cemeteries grew in rows around
them.

p. 426: Figure 6.13 vessel is incised, not engraved?
p. 428: Figure 6.14 vessel is incised, not engraved?
p. 428: Wilder Engraved ollas are also known
from Big Cypress basin Titus phase sites.

Table 5.4: I think the comparison based on mean
and range in grave sizes is an excellent one to
draw.

p. 378: what are the archeological correlates of
a warrior-hunter?

p. 433: Did any of the vessels, especially the engraved wares, have a resinous residue, typically
on the exterior vessel surface. In documenting
Titus phase vessels from Little and Big Cypress
creek sites, we have noticed the resinous residues are relatively common.

p. 378: why is knowledge of the iconographic
motif suggest esoteric knowledge? Is religious
ritual generally esoteric?

p. 435: I had never considered that the circle
element was not the central element, despite
Thurmondâs terminology.

p. 380: when discussion of the iconographic
imagery is introduced in chapter 5, it would be
helpful if the key motifs and elements are illus-

p. 442 and Figure 6.20a: the rim treatment
closely resembles what Walters (2010) calls the
Redwine mode; I have seen this form of rim

p. 376-377: what might those multiple criteria
be?

943

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
treatment in Titus phase vessel collections.
Figure 6.36a also appears to have this rim
treatment.

Figure 6.31a-b: need drawing of decorative motifs to assess the typological identifications.
p. 457: Maydelle Incised vessels also occur in
the Titus phase.

p. 442: band of alternating elements look like
alternating nested triangles as the principal
element rather than slanted bars.

p. 457: LaRue is the better identification, in large
part because Red River Caddo made Nash as a
shell-tempered ware, but LaRue is a grog-bonetempered East Texas utility ware jar.

Figure 6.22c: the row of short incised lines or
punctations is a rim treatment seen on vessels
from Pilgrimâs Pride (41CP304) and Rookery
Ridge (41UR133). I had dubbed this Ripley
Engraved, var. Walkers Creek. Figure 6.35a-c
also have this distinctive rim treatment, as does
Figure 6.40a, Figure 6.41a, and Figure 6.48a.

Table 6.15 (and also p. 505, 634): I wonder if the
sherds identified as Pennington may be from
vessels that we have seen in Titus phase burials
at the Henry Spencer site (41UR315) that have
curvilinear and triangular incised zones filled
with punctations, rather than being considered
evidence of Early Caddo use:

Figure 6.23a-b and p. 442: I would be more
inclined to sort out Figure 6.23a-b as not being
Ripley, but Turner Engraved, a common compound bowl form in Big and Little Cypress Titus
phase vessel collections.
p. 442 and Figure 6.24a-b: These are relatively
common Titus phase vessel and decorative
forms, and I think Avery Engraved is a dubious
identification. The absence of shell-tempering in
both vessels also suggests there is not much of
an Avery connection. On Figure 6.24b, there is
a typical bracket/divider element that separates
the circles, and this element is rather common
in Little Cypress Creek vessels we have been
documenting from the Gum Creek complex of
sites in Upshur County.
Figure 6.27a: good example of Ripley, with horizontal scrolls.

p. 475: Even in combination with grog, the percentage of bone-temper is very high, more like
what I see farther downstream on the Sabine
and in parts of the Neches-Angelina river basins,
than is usually the case in Titus phase assemblages as a general rule.

p. 447 and Figure 6.27b-c: look like carinated
bowls rather than compound bowls
p. 452: the use of a orange/red wash or slip on
interior and/or exterior surfaces of some jars
has been documented recently at 41CP88 and
41CP408 (Middle and Late Caddo sites) in the
Little Cypress Creek basin (headwaters of Lilly
Creek).

p. 478, Figure 6.38a: incised rather than engraved lines?
p. 485, Figure 6.45b: incised rather than engraved lines?

p. 452 and Figure 6.30a: To identify Cass Appliqued, a vessel needs to have vertical appliqued
ridges or fillets. I am dubious of the type identification of Vessel 2.2079-6, and wonder if it might
be a variety of Pease or Karnack.

Figure 6.47d: I cannot see any engraved rectilinear lines on the image of this red-slipped
sherd.

944

Appendix N: Review Comments on the Draft Report
Figure 6.48e: I would identify this rim sherd
as Ripley, with a nested triangle motif, with an
interior diamond (?).

This is hackneyed taxonomic classification, and
does those of us working with arrow points no
good.

Figure 6.55b: more likely this is a Maydelle
Incised rim rather than Pennington

p. 562: Alba points are found at the George C.
Davis site in contexts that date from ca. A.D.
850-1300, so it could be said that they are common in both Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo
periods.

Figure 6.57b: Belcher Ridged, var. Belcher according to Girard (2007:15).

Figure 7.1p: Maud is as likely an identification
as Fresno; Figure 7.1q, dubious Friley type;
Figure 7.1gg-jj: look like Alba-Bonham.

Figure 6.57e: this kind of short and flared rim
may be more characteristic of Belcher Ridged
and Karnack Brushed-Incised than Pease (see
Girard 2007:Figure 6b).

p. 566: Bonham make more sense as Middle
Caddo era arrow points.

p. 512: engraved rattlesnake vessels are found
outside of the Sabine and Big Cypress drainages,
but also in Caddo sites in the Angelina, Red, and
Ouachita River.

p. 566: Perdiz points are also abundant in Middle
Caddo contexts in East Texas: the Oak Hill Village assemblage is a good example

p. 517: good point. I would not be surprised if the
stemmed vessels (in both Titus and Frankston
phase sites) had nothing to do with chalices.

p. 566: what colors are represented in the local
cherts?
p. 567: what might the source possibilities be for
a medium-grained white or cream chert?

Figure 6.71: these look like incised pipes, not
engraved. They match up very well with 15th
century elbow pipes from the upper Neches
River basin.

p. 568: the translucent cherts do not sound like
local cherts to me. The reddish, dark red, and
yellowish-tan cherts do sound like local cherts.

p. 548: ceramic disks/spindle whorls have been
found in Caddo sites in East Texas of all ages.

p. 571: but is Carrollton point regularly found
in East Texas

p. 554: I donât remember thinking that Hurricane
Hill raw material use was uniquely different
than at other Caddo sites. Given the fact that
the landform the site was on had extensive
knappable quartzite probably influenced its raw
material composition.

Figure 7.5e: Godley is a better type match than
Ellis-Edgewood.
Figure 7.5n-o: these in no way resemble Yarbrough points

p. 555: does thermal damage mean heat-treatment or pot-lidding, or both?

p. 573: the Gary var. Gary dates to the Late
Archaic and early part of the Woodland period,
according to Schambach (1982, 1998)

p. 556: Donât you mean after the mid-1680s,
rather than prior to the early 1680s?

p. 573: what kind of different quartzite?

p. 561: Turnerâs (2006) analysis indicates that
grooved axes are likely to be Middle and Late
Archaic in age, not simply the Archaic period.

p. 574: need new sentence after âferruginous
sandstone.â It should start with âNon-local
cherts include gray chert, etc.

p. 562: are Alba-Bonham and Perdiz-Bassett
really established styles? Who defined them? If
they are, then they need new type names, rather
than be labeled by conjoining two separate types.

p. 574-576: how were the other bifaces used? Or
were they?

945

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
Figure 7.7d-g: not classic Caddo drills, but look
more like perforators only.

ceramic styles donât help demonstrate cultural
continuity.

p. 580: what kinds/colors of local chert are represented? Table 7.3 could be refined if the âChert,
otherâ categories for both local and non-local raw
materials were identified in more detail, by color,
or other attributes.

p. 645: It was a Nasoni Caddo town, not a Kadohadacho town.
p. 647: If as many as 800 individuals were buried in the core area, that suggests something of
the population of the village as a whole, as well
as the length of time the core area was in use.
How many non-elites may have been buried at
the site?

Table 7.4: where is a local source of limestone
in this part of the Sabine River basin? Bigfork
chert and black chert may well be the same raw
material.

p. 649: If there were parts of the site where no
trenching was done, were not these areas subsequently destroyed anyway? If non-trenched
areas were not investigated during the 2006
work, how likely is it that significant but unexplored parts of the site were destroyed. This calls
into question the idea that an extensive site like
Pine Tree, even just the village areas outside
of the core area, could ever be fully mitigated,
especially to insure that no Caddo burials or
cemeteries would not be overlooked.

Figure 7.18a: a similar stone bead was recovered
from a burial at the Titus phase Henry Spencer
site (41UR315)
p. 609 and Table 8.3: Taddlock (41WD482), with
a very large faunal assemblage, would have been
a useful site to add for comparison purposes.
p. 627: intervals rather than intercepts?
p. 634: Coles Creek Incised is not necessarily
an âearly ceramicâ, as it was made and used
between ca. A.D. 700-1200.

p. 655: if one considers the totality of the Hatchel
site (i.e. for the time the mound was constructed,
not just a moment in time in 1691), the ceremonial precinct was in the center of the village, not
at its northern upstream end.

p. 636: Need to look at Middle Caddo sites in East
Texas (in Sabine and Big Cypress drainages) for
precursors to Pine Tree, not Early Caddo sites
like Hudnall-Pirtle.

Table 9.2, 41HS846: the P/DR of 1.3 does not fit
with an assemblage with 43 bushed sherds out
of 74 collected sherds.

p. 638: the main Caddo occupation at Oak Hill
was between 1150-1450, the ending date which
I consider to be the end of the Middle Caddo
period in East Texas.

p. 655: The ceramics and pipes from the Grayâs
Pasture site have been summarized in Perttula
(2000), while the Keller and Speir n.d. is barely
what can be called a MS.

p. 643: In the case of Emory Punctated, the
type is equally as common in Caddo sites to the
north on the Red River, rather than east, and
in fact, what is called Emory in NW Louisiana
is not typologically the same as Emory noted in
McCurtain and historic Caddo assemblages to
the north.

p. 660: The presence of Handy Engraved, etc.
at 41HS144 is good evidence that the site has a
Middle Caddo component, not an Early Caddo
component.
p. 661: population âat any one timeâ of 400 people
makes more sense.

p. 643-644: I donât think I am convinced that
there is a direct connection between the Nadaco
Caddo of the early 18th to early 19th century
(Kinsloe phase) and the Pine Tree community.
It would take DNA/genetic analyses of human
remains to really make that case; changes in

p. 661: Oak Hill Village and sites at Martin
Creek Lake are better viewed as Middle Caddo
components that end around 1450 than as Late
Caddo sites. Oak Hill had little in the view of
post-1450 decorated ceramics. The fact that
946

Appendix N: Review Comments on the Draft Report
brushed sherds are numerous does not mean
they are Late Caddo, not by any stretch, since
it is known that brushed pottery is relatively
abundant in a number of post 1250-1300 (Middle
Caddo) sites in East Texas.

areas donât strike me as peripheral. There must
be many political communities dispersed around
but outside the defined heartland area. I donât
see them as part of a confederation (p. 572).
p. 669: the non-mound shaft tombs at Lower
Peach Orchard at Lake Bob Sandlin is probably also part of a community on Big Cypress
upstream from Tankersley Creek.

p. 662: Pease Brushed-Incised is not a proxy for
Late Caddo, as it is quite common in Middle
Caddo components, especially along the Red
River. Of the 76 vessels from a Middle Caddo,
Haley phase, component at the Crenshaw site,
18% of the whole vessels were Pease BrushedIncised. The only type that was more common
was Handy Engraved (34%).

p. 671: I am far from convinced these days that
there is any relationship between the origins and
development of Titus phase community cemeteries and European infectious disease spread. I
think that some of the community cemeteries
developed before 1540.

p. 664: the model for the Frankston-Allen phase
does not equate mounds with lesser ceremonial
centers, and in fact there are very few Frankston
phase mounds even known. Lesser centers can
represent the locations of caddi settlements, or
the locations of other elites, ritual structures,
etc. Distinct constituent groups may be more
readily definable on the Sabine perhaps through
analyses of ceramic styles and decorative elements than relying on mound sites.

p. 673: It makes sense to see Pine Tree Mound
as a 3rd major Titus core community, at least on
ceramic grounds. Mound construction (especially
the construction of platform mounds) and differences in burial orientation (p. 578, where it is
suggested this speaks to significant differences
in group identity) suggest that Pine Tree is not
a Titus phase core community, but is the apex
of a related community of Caddo peoples (e.g.,
the Potters Creek phase)

Figure 9.11: the only reason the Titus phase
heartland isnât bigger, or that other communities have not been defined is likely the absence
of research across all parts of what is recognized
as the Titus phase. If I had my druthers, I would
dispense with the phase altogether, and define
communities across the region is a similar manner as what has been done in this report, rather
than trying to get a better picture of the Titus
whole (p. 580).

p. 673: I agree that the Whelan phase construct
should be discarded, given that the dates from
the site range from the 14th to 16th century and
later. Because of the dates, I donât necessarily
see Whelan as representing the beginning of
the Titus phase.
p. 673: Ollas seem particularly characteristic of
eastern Titus phase sites.

p. 666: I think it is an intriguing suggestion that
Ripley Engraved may have evolved stylistically
from Haley and Handy Engraved bottles and
bowls in the Red River valley. At the same time,
I think that we would be better served to look in
Middle Caddo ceramic assemblages (from whole
vessels in graves) in the Big Cypress and Sabine
River basins to look for progenitors of Ripley.

p. 677: The Toledo Bend sites should be part of
the discussion. It would be difficult to push the
boundaries of the greater Titus area to the west,
as one would be moving well out in the post oak
savannah and prairie, not places one would expect to find many Titus phase sites.
p. 677: It is clear that the Pine Tree Mound
represents a premier mound center and seat of
power and authority. Contemporaneous sites
comparable in East Texas would include Hatchel, Sam Kaufman, and maybe A. C. Saunders,
but that is about it (Whelan, perhaps, is worthy
of mention). Platform mounds are few and far
between. I think each represents the seat of

p. 667: I never considered areas outside of the
âheartlandâ to be âperipheral; better considered
as poorly studied. For example, it is known that
there are Titus phase mounds on Little Cypress
(Rookery Ridge) and in the upper Sabine (along
Caney Creek in the Lake Fork Creek drainage)âcovering burned structuresâso those

Excavations at the Pine Tree Mound Site
p. 794: We do not know that there was frequent
long-distance trade, and this has been hard to
identify in INAA, but we certainly have no evidence to conclude that morphologically similar
pottery was being frequently traded throughout
the region. Even if morphologically similar pottery was being traded, unlikely that all would
be compositionally similar.

power of important communities, but communities subsumed within taxonomic constructs that
are not especially helpful.
Appendices A-B are top-notch pieces of work,
as are the INAA and petrographic analyses in
Appendix C and D.
p. 715: It is Fourche Maline. Also, Gill-King 1990
was published in 1999, so the reference needs to
be updated and corrected.

p. 799: What research design is referred to
here?

p. 715: Tine and Tieszen 1997 is not in ref.
cited.
p. 717: Cedar Grove is a Late to Historic Caddo
farmstead
Table A.13: Wilson n.d. should be cited as Wilson
2004, and Wilson (in press) should be cited as
2008.
p. 720: Mitchell is not a mound center, but part of
the Hatchel village. McLelland and Cedar Grove
are not situated on the lower Red River.
Table B.15 needs considerable revision: a, I
do not believe there is a Theros site; it is not
mentioned in Dering; (2) Spoonbill trinomial is
41WD109, Ray trinomial is 41LR135; (3) 41RA49
is Middle Caddo, Roitsch is Late Caddo; (4) it
is Pine Cone site, not Pinecone; (5) Dering n.d.
should be replaced by Fritz 2008; and (6) CobbPool is best characterized as late Prehistoric, 13th
century, rather than âPrairie Caddoâ.
p. 763: Need more discussion of non-economic
use of pine cones in features: as producers of
large amounts of smoke.
p. 764: need ref. for mention of large grass seed
at Spiro
p. 790: Subregion is not the closest subregion
to the north of Pine Tree, but Subregions 4 and
10 are.
p. 794: what are TKP250, 251, and 254? More
detail ought to be provided.
p. 794: Why is it surprising that there are no
samples outside the Caddo region that are similar? Can this point be expanded upon?
