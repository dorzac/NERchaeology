The Battle of Resaca de la Palma, the second battle of the Mexican-American War, was fought on May 9, 1846
near the Rio Grande in southern Texas. The battle was won decisively by United States troops and resulted
in the death of hundreds of Mexican soldiers who were subsequently buried in mass graves. One of the mass
graves (41CF3) contained the skeletal remains of 27 to 36 adult male soldiers, including those from the Seventh
and Tenth Infantry companies. The skeletal remains were examined for battle-related injuries. The anatomical
location of each wound was documented and each lesion was inspected to determine the timing, type of wound,
and the direction of the force. More than half of the individuals exhibited osteological evidence of battle-related
trauma. The wound distribution pattern and type of wounds present demonstrates that traditional battle tactics,
as well as hand-to-hand combat, occurred at Resaca de la Palma.

In 1845, the Mexican government perceived
the annexation of Texas by the United States (U.S.)
Congress as an intrusion onto their sovereign lands,
setting in motion the Mexican-American War that
lasted from May 1846 to February 1848. The Battle
of Resaca de la Palma, fought on May 9, 1846, was
the second major battle of the war. The decisive
victory of this battle by U.S. troops is thought by
many historians as having established the U.S. as a
dominant military power (Smith 1919; Bauer 1974;
Eisenhower 1989).
Although there had been a few skirmishes between U.S. and Mexican troops before May 1846,

soldiers, commanded by General Mariano Arista,
attacked the U.S. Army at Palo Alto in Texas on
May 8, 1846 (Haecker and Mauck 1997). While the
Battle of Palo Alto was generally inconclusive, the
smaller U.S. Army (approximately 1700–2200 U.S.
soldiers versus 3200–3700 Mexican soldiers), commanded by General Zachary Taylor, held a tactical
advantage, and the Mexican Army withdrew the
IROORZLQJ?PRUQLQJ?WR?ÀQG?D?PRUH?VWUDWHJLF?SRVLWLRQ?
(DePalo 1997). The new defensive position was
established at a dry channel of the Rio Grande,
known as Resaca de la Palma, approximately eight

kilometers (5 miles) south of Palo Alto and just
north of the Rio Grande in present-day Brownsville, Texas. Arista’s artillery took up positions
on both sides of the road to Matamoros, while his
infantry regiments took cover along the channel
walls and soldiers concealed themselves in the
thick chaparral north of the channel.
On the afternoon of May 9, 1846, General
Taylor ordered his troops to strike. United States
artillery, infantry, and cavalry units attacked the
Mexican center. The U.S. infantrymen were armed

the Rio Grande (DePalo 1997). On May 10, U.S.
military personnel were assigned to retrieve supplies
and documents left behind by the Mexican Army and
to bury the dead. The corpses of the Mexican soldiers
were interred in large pits containing as many as 50
to 100 individuals (Jarvis 1907).

burials along with numerous bones (mainly hand

be convincingly associated with the primary burials.
Each of the primary burials was assigned a burial

were not assigned for unknown reasons (Table 1).
The deceased Mexican soldiers in the grave
pit at 41CF3 appear to have been heaved into the
burial pit, resulting in overlap and commingling
of the skeletons (Figures 1 and 2). Most of the
articulated remains were in a supine position and
laid out in pseudo-rows with the bodies lying side
by side in each row and the heads of the soldiers
in each subsequent row placed between the legs of
the soldiers in the preceding row (Figure 2). Three
primary clusters (north, central, and south) of
skeletons were discovered during the excavation
(Table 1, and Figure 1). There were as many as 12
individuals in the southern third of the grave pit
with most in an extended position and their heads
directed east. At least two individuals (Burial No.
19 and Burial No. 20) in the southeastern portion
were represented by lower limb bones only (Table
1, and Figures 1 and 2). The upper halves of the
bodies were most likely destroyed by construction activity at the time of discovery. In addition,
Burial No. 13 was comprised of a skull only,
Burial No. 10 was represented by a skull and right
upper limb bones, and Burial No. 22 consisted of
the left upper limb bones and right and left lower
limb bones. In the center of the grave were two
skeletons (Burial No. 4 and Burial No. 11) lying

heads south (Figure 1). A third partial skeleton
(Burial No. 27) was lying extended with the feet
pointing west and the legs overlapping the other
two skeletons (Burial No. 4 and No. 11). An isolated skull and several long bones (Burial No. 3)
were also recovered from the center of the grave
(Figure 1). Wesolowsky (1969a) suggested that
bones from the center of the burial pit had been
disturbed by a previous human activity, but there is
no record of previous construction, archeological
excavations or looting at the site.

In the northern portion of the grave were approximately 13 articulated and partially articulated
skeletons lying in an extended position with their
heads east or southeast. Like the southern section, several individuals at the northeastern edge
of the site were missing bones, possibly due to
construction activity. The skulls of Burial No. 14
and Burial No. 15 were absent. In addition, Burial
No. 18 in the north-central section of the grave
pit was composed of a skull only, and there were

1994) argued that these extra bones may represent
body parts dismembered during battle that were
placed in the grave by U.S. soldiers. This assertion
is impossible to verify due to the disturbance of the
remains during earthmoving activities and possible
mixing of individuals during the preliminary laboratory analysis (Wesolowsky 1969a). Furthermore,
there was considerable overlapping of limb bones
in the northern portion of the grave pit, making it

Discovered with the skeletal remains were
some military artifacts including bone and metal
uniform buttons, buckles, insignia, canteens, and
three musket balls (Fox 1983). Very few weapons
or items of value were found with the remains as
such objects were most likely collected by U.S.
soldiers before the Mexican soldiers were buried.

A shako badge from the Seventh Infantry was
in association with one of the primary skeletons
(Burial No. 8) and a crossbelt insignia for the Tenth
Infantry was found in the grave backdirt removed
by the construction equipment.

After completion of the excavation, the exhumed skeletons and artifacts were sent to the
University of Texas at Austin for cleaning, reconstruction, inventory, and preliminary analysis.
Bones that were not clearly associated with the primary burials were assigned letter designations by
provenience in the sequence they were unpacked
(Wesolowsky 1969b). Each of the primary burials
was also assigned a University of Texas Physical Anthropology Catalog Number (see Table 1).

Wesolowsky (1969a) noted that during the initial
cleaning some of the bones from the primary burials may have become mixed, but he believed that
most of the discrepancies were later corrected.
Based on the initial analysis of the remains at the
University of Texas, Wesolowsky (1969a) concluded that there were 31 primary burials and six
or seven additional individuals are represented by
bones from the surface or those with no provenience for a total of 37 to 38 individuals. However,
Wesolowsky (1969a) provided no clear reason for
his conclusion regarding the number of individuals
represented at the site. He did note that Burial No.
1 was combined with Burial No. 14, and that both
Burial No. 9 and Burial No. 19 contained more
than one individual. Consequently, Wesolowsky
split them into Burial Nos. 9a, 9b, 19a, and 19b.
In the early 1990s, Ratliff (1993) undertook
a second analysis of the remains from 41CF3 for
his thesis research. During his investigation, he
matched some of the unassociated bones with the
primary burials using the proximity of the bone to
the burial and bilateral asymmetry. Ratliff (1993),
like Wesolowsky (1969a), concluded that there were
31 individuals represented by the skeletal remains
from Resaca de la Palma, but he combined the remains slightly different than Wesolowsky (1969a).
He argued that the skeletal remains labeled Burials
No. 22 and 24 were from the same individual and
combined them. He also combined the postcrania
of Burial No. 3 (2280) with Burial No. 27 (2261).
Ratliff (1993:29) also created a Burial No. 0 consisting of bones “recovered aside from the archaeologiFDO? LQYHVWLJDWLRQ?µ? DQG? DVVLJQHG? %XULDO? 1R?? ?? WR? D?

drawing or originally assigned a burial number. Furthermore, he assigned a skeleton that was excavated
by earthmoving machinery during the construction
project as Burial No. 3. Finally, he combined Burial
Nos. 9b and 19b to form Burial No. 33.
To date, no archeological report has been
completed for 41CF3. The skeletal remains were
repatriated in 2010 after the Mexican Senate passed
a resolution calling for the Foreign Ministry to pursue repatriation. Associated artifacts, archeological
notes, and preliminary skeletal report are currently
housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. Summaries of the excavation and skeletal analysis were published by Hester
(1978) and Fox (1983), respectively. A relatively
complete skeletal inventory and bone dimensions
can be found in Ratliff (1993).

major elements. An inventory of the major bones
IRU? HDFK? RI? WKH? SUHYLRXVO\? LGHQWLÀHG? LQGLYLGXDOV?
was also conducted. The minimum number of
individuals (MNI) was estimated by the highest
bone count (i.e., most frequently occurring bone),
and represents an estimate of the number of individuals recovered. To estimate the original or
actual number of individuals that contributed to
the recovered skeletal assemblage, the most likely
number of individuals (MLNI) was also calculated
with Equation 9 in Adams and Konigsberg (2004)
using paired and unpaired femora. Calculations of
MLNI were done using the Excel™ spreadsheet
made available by Konigsberg (http://konig.la.utk.
edu/MLNI.html). Taphonomic aspects of the assemblage were assessed using burial locations and
examining each element for evidence of animal
scavenging marks (punctures, pits, scoring and
furrows), staining, and post-depositional damage.
%LRORJLFDO?3URÀOH?(VWLPDWLRQ
Primary skeletons and isolated elements were
assigned as undetermined sex, probable female,
female, probable male, or male following Buikstra
and Ubelaker (1994) using standard morphological and metric characteristic of the pelvis, skull,
and long bones (Bass 1995; Buikstra and Ubelaker

Westcott et al.—$?0DVV?*UDYH?RI?0H[LFDQ?6ROGLHUV?IURP?WKH?5HVDFD?GH?OD?3DOPD?%DWWOHÀHOG

1994; Ubelaker 1989). When possible, the pelvis
was used to estimate sex, but in many cases overall size, femoral and humeral head diameters, and
robusticity were used in the determination of sex.
None of the skeletal elements exhibit evidence
of incomplete growth (e.g., unfused epiphyses,
unerupted teeth), so age-at-death was determined
using pubic symphysis, auricular surface, cranial suture closure, and other standard adult aging
methods (Bass 1995; Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994).
Due to the fragmentary condition of the remains

individual was assigned to one of the following
adult age categories: young adult (YA: 20-34 years),
middle adult (MA: 35-49 years), old adult (OA:
50+ years), or adult of undetermined age (UA). The
morphology of the skeletal remains is consistent
with Mexican ancestry but no attempts were made
to metrically estimate ancestry due to the lack of
comparative population standards. Stature was
reconstructed from femoral length using regression
equations for Mesoamericans (Genovés 1967).

Each of the skeletal elements was examined

timing of the wound was categorized as antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem (Sauer 1998;

injuries showed no signs of healing. Perimortem
injuries were distinguished from postmortem injuries by examining the lesion/fracture pattern and
fracture surface morphology, and comparing the
lesion/fracture surface color to the bone surface
color (Johnson 1985; Maples 1986; Sauer 1998;
Galloway et al. 1999; Wieberg and Wescott 2008).
Maples (1986) notes that depressed fractures of
the skull, fractures where the fragments fail to
separate, and fractures with concentric or radiating fracture lines are indicative of a perimortem

and bone surface. Postmortem fractures usually
have jagged fracture surfaces and breaks at right
angles (Johnson 1985; Sauer 1998; Wieberg and
Wescott 2008). Unhealed projectile wounds were

(1999a-e), Merbs (1989) and Reichs (1998). Projectile wounds were distinguished by the presence
of an entrance (inward beveling) or exit (outward
beveling) wound or using concentric fracture angles
(Berryman and Symes 1998). The direction of projectile wounds was established using wound shape
and alignment characteristics (Berryman and Symes
1998). Sharp force trauma was diagnosed by 1) a

force trauma may exhibit blunt force characteristics
caused by a narrowly focused force. The angle of

No. 9 is represented by only a few bones and is
most likely not a distinct burial. Ratliff (1993) later
had assigned University of Texas catalog number
2224 as Burial No. 1 and surface remains (Catalog
No. 2247) as Burial No. 0. However, the skeleton

number was not included in the original excavation or analysis notes and some of the bones are
labeled with a different site number. In addition,
the skeletal and dental morphology are distinct
from other burials from 41CF3. The cranium is
more robust and exhibits a higher and shorter vault
than the other crania from the site. This individual
is also much older and exhibits a different pattern
of dental attrition.
While archeologists were able to identify 30
burials, an inventory of the remains reveals that
27 to 36 individuals were buried in the mass grave
at Resaca de la Palma. The MNI of 27 is based on
the count of left femora (Table 2). However, the 50
femora present could be grouped into at least 17
pairs, which suggest that the most likely number of
individuals represented at 41CF3 is 36. This MLNI
is consistent with Wesolowsky’s (1969a) original
estimate of 37 to 38 individuals.

male and seven are probable males. All of the
unassociated bones that could be sexed are also
probably male. The skeleton (2224) designated by
Ratliff (1993) as Burial No. 1 has clear morphological features of the pelvis found almost exclusively
in females, including a wide greater sciatic notch,
ventral arc, deep and rugged preauricular sulcus,
and dorsal pubic pitting (Figure 3). However, for
reasons stated previously, this individual most
likely was not recovered from 41CF3. Most of the
males were young to middle-aged adults in their
second or third decade of life but a few were older
(see Table 1). Estimations of stature range from
155 to 170 cm with an average of 162 cm.

The deceased Mexican soldiers in the pit at
41CF3 appear to have been heaved into the burial
pit, causing overlap and commingling of the skeletons (see Figure 2). Three primary clusters (north,
central, and south) of skeletons were discovered
during the excavation (see Table 1, and Figure 1).
Most of the primary skeletons are only partially

One of the crania from 41CF3
exhibits a unique pattern of postmortem damage. Burial No. 3
(Cat. No. 2273) exhibits numerous short but deep scratches on
the left side of the frontal and the
left parietal. The scratches often
form an X-shape pattern and
continue along the parietal in an
arch following along the sagittal
and coronal sutures (Figure 4).

Projectile injuries were the most prevalent type of
battle-related trauma followed by sharp force lesions
(Table 3). The distribution and types of perimortem
battle-related lesions are shown in Figure 7. Eighteen
of the 29 individuals display perimortem battlerelated trauma, with several skeletons exhibiting
multiple wounds. Projectile trauma was observed on
12 skeletons, sharp-edge trauma on seven skeletons,
and blunt trauma on two skeletons. Most of the projectile wounds are manifest as large oval or circular
depressed fractures (Figure 8) or elongated grooves in

the bone, both of which were examined closely to determine if they could be related to postmortem burial
damage. The size of the depressed fractures varies
greatly, ranging from 2 mm to greater than 40 mm in
diameter. Bones with projectile wounds include the
cranium, vertebrae, ribs, ilium, humerus, femur, and
tibia (Figure 7, and Table 3). There were several more
evident projectile defects observed. Burial No. 15, for
example, is a middle-aged adult, probable male that
has a large depressed fracture (27 x 31 mm) on the
right proximal tibia with the projectile still embedded
in the wound (Figure 9), a projectile induced depression (21 x 19) on the left medial condyle of the femur,
and a 9 to 10 mm diameter circular depressed fracture

at the right iliopubic junction. Burial No. 17 has an
inward beveling oval hole with three radiating fractures on the left side of the cranium near asterion and
an outward beveling oval hole on the right squamosal
suture. These wounds are consistent with a projectile
entrance and exit wound, respectively, with the projectile entering the left side of the skull at a slightly
upward trajectory (Figure 10). Burial No. 4 exhibits
numerous small puncture wounds on the lumbar
vertebrae, right ilium, and right femoral neck. While
the cause of these wounds cannot be determined, they
are consistent with shotgun or buck and ball trauma.
Radiographs of the bones are needed to determine if
metal fragments are present in any of the wounds. If
the punctures are due to shotgun pellets, the angle of
the punctures suggest an upward trajectory consistent
with the individual being shot by a soldier positioned
in front of him at a lower elevation or with the victim
shot while lying on his back. Finally, an inward beveling (projectile entrance) wound was observed on the

frontal bone superior to the right orbit of Burial No.
13. Fractures radiate from the defect into the coronal
suture and right orbit. No exit wound was observed,
however, the posterior portion of the cranium was
not recovered.
Bones with sharp force cuts and punctures
include the frontal, parietal, cervical vertebra,
clavicle, humerus, ulna, femur, and tibia (see Table
3; Figure 7). Sharp force trauma to the femur occurs most frequently followed by lesions to the
cranium. Some of the more evident examples of
sharp force trauma include Burial Nos. 15, 27, 28,
and possibly 3. Burial No. 3 (Cat. No. 2273) has a
2.3 mm wide and 43 mm long incision through the
right orbit and frontal bone (Figure 11). A small,
postmortem fracture radiates superiorly from the
cut. The superior margin of the wound exhibits
a distinct tapering and a V-shaped cross-section.
This lesion is possibly perimortem but could have
been caused postmortem. However, the color

differentiation and shape of the cut is not consistent with damage caused during excavation. The
morphology of the lesion indicates that if it was
perimortem, it was directed from a right-handed
soldier facing the victim. The cranium from Burial
No. 27 has a large (5 mm wide and 39 mm long)
puncture wound with associated radiating fractures
to the posterolateral surface of the left parietal
(Figure 12). While this type of wound was probably caused by a sharp weapon, it also exhibits
narrowly focused blunt force characteristics. The
caudal margin of the puncture is squared-off while
the cranial end is tapered. Burial No. 15 exhibits
three cut marks. There is a cut across the acromial
end of the left clavicle (Figure 13), a 4.2 mm wide

and 46 mm long chop mark on the posterior surface of the greater trochanter (Figure 14), and a
short (24 mm long) cut on the medial surface of
the right tibia. While it is possible that these cuts
were caused by postmortem activities, the wound
characteristics are consistent with perimortem
trauma. Finally, Burial No. 28 has a puncture/cut
on the posterior surface of the medial epicondyle
of the right humerus.

(e.g., Liston and Baker 1996; Pfeiffer and Williamson
1991; Willey and Scott 1996) have provided unique
information on the common soldiers participating in
North American military campaigns. The skeletal remains of Mexican soldiers from the Battle of Resaca
de la Palma add to this database of information by
providing valuable data regarding this historic battle.
'HPRJUDSK\?DQG?%XULDO?3RVLWLRQ
The skeletal remains from Resaca de la Palma
represent at least 27 individuals and most likely 36
individuals from the Mexican Army. The bodies
appear to have been placed in a shallow grave pit
in a supine position and laid out in pseudo-rows
with the bodies lying side by side in each row and
the heads of soldiers in subsequent rows placed
between the legs of the soldiers in the preceding
row. The taphonomic evidence is consistent with
historical documents regarding the burial of the
Mexican soldiers at Resaca de la Palma. There is
very little evidence of animal scavenging activity,

as would be expected for bodies buried within 24
KRXUV??+RZHYHU??WKHUH?LV?VLJQLÀFDQW?ORVV?RI?VNHOHWDO?
elements and postmortem damage due to construction work and possible looting. The placement of
the bodies (see Figure 2) in the grave is consistent with the bodies being buried by adversarial
(U.S.) troops, as indicated by historical accounts.
Thomas Holland (personal communication 2006)
has observed that soldiers buried by comrades are
generally laid out face up with the hands carefully
positioned and bodies lined up side by side in rows.
On the other hand, enemy troops do not usually
take the time to carefully position the bodies during
burial. As a result, there is frequent commingling
and the bodies are found in a variety of positions.
While the bodies at Resaca de la Palma were partially arranged in rows with the bodies in a supine
position, the arms were not placed in any standard
position, and several bodies were placed on top of
others facing the opposite direction (see Figure 2).
Ratcliff (1993) argued that at least one female
was present among the skeletal remains from
Resaca de la Palma. Female camp followers,
known as soldaderas, traveled with the Mexican
Army serving as domestic servants and sometimes

18

combatants (Salas 1990; Young 1994; Haecker and
Mauck 1997). Many of these women were wives or
mistresses of the soldiers, and provided vital tasks,
such as collecting food to supplement rations, preparing meals, and mending and cleaning uniforms
and equipment. There is osteological evidence for
the presence of at least one female among the remains cataloged at TARL as being part of Resaca
de la Palma, but this skeleton was not included in
the original inventory or part of the original burial
map. In addition, cranial morphology and the dental attrition of this individual are distinct from that
of individuals from Resaca. The female remains
are most likely associated with another site and
were accidently mixed with the remains of 41CF3.
Therefore, we believe that all the remains represent
male soldiers that died during the battle.
The common Mexican soldier or soldado was
a conscript from the lower socioeconomic tiers (e.g.,
laborers and farmers) of Mexican society. Soldiers
were generally Indian or mestizo and were forced
to serve an 8 to 10 year enlistment with poor pay,
and meager and unsanitary living conditions (Young
1994). Mexican military recruits were generally
in their second or third decade of life and usually
ranged between 162 and 173 cm in height (Young
1994). The age distribution of individuals recovered
from 41CF3 is consistent with this description.
Furthermore, of the individuals from Resaca de
la Palma where stature could be estimated, height
ranged from 155 to 170 cm with a mean of 162.3 cm.
7UDXPD
The Mexican soldiers who fought at the Battle
of Resaca de la Palma are thought to have been
battle experienced, but there are few, if any, antemortem injuries that can be attributed to battle
experience. It is likely that many of these soldiers
obtained injuries related to the farming and labor
jobs they performed prior to being drafted into the

seen on the skeletal remains were from previous
combat. Furthermore, it is also possible that because the Battle of Resaca de la Palma occurred
early in the war only healthy men were on the front
OLQHV??ZKLFK?ZRXOG?DOVR?H[SODLQ?WKH?ODFN?RI?GHÀQLtive antemortem battle-related trauma.
Contrary to previous reports on the skeletal
remains from Resaca de la Palma (Wesolowsky
1969c; Ratliff 1994), we observed that over half

(58 percent) of the Mexican soldiers have unhealed
battle-related injuries observable on the skeletons.
There is considerable postmortem damage to the
skeletons from 41CF3, but many of the individuals
exhibit injuries with perimortem characteristics.
The number of soldiers with observable injuries at
Resaca de la Palma is consistent with prevalence
rates reported for other military samples (Snow
and Fitzpatrick 1989; Owsley et al. 1991). Unlike
some military cemeteries (Owsley et al. 1991),
however, it can be assumed that all of the soldiers
in the burial pit at Resaca de la Palma received fatal
combat injuries. Many of these injuries may not
have left an osteological signatures (i.e., resulted
in soft tissue injuries only) or were obscured by
postmortem processes. Burial No. 27, for example,
was found with a projectile in the torso but there
is no evidence of the entrance wound on the bones
of the thoracic cage. The fragmentary nature of the
crania, ribs, vertebrae, and sterna of the Mexican
soldiers probably also prevented recognition of
some of the bone lesions. Perimortem blunt force

It is likely that the number of blunt force injuries
was underestimated in this study.
At the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, the Mexican soldados were confronted by a well-trained
and well-equipped U.S. Army accompanied by a
few Texas volunteers (Haecker and Mauck 1997).
Each soldier was armed with either a musket with
DWWDFKHG? ED\RQHW? RU? D? ÁLQWORFN? ULIH?? ZKLOH? 7H[DV?
volunteers carried shotguns or muskets. The U.S.
artillery units were especially well-trained and
discharged round shot, canister, and explosive shell
from their cannons (Haecker and Mauck 1997;
Mischke 2002). As a result, it is not surprising that
SURMHFWLOHV?LQÁLFWHG?WKH?JUHDWHVW?QXPEHU?RI?REVHUYable battle-related injuries.
The relatively high prevalence of sharp force
trauma is consistent with the historical record that
indicates the Battle of Resaca de la Palma was one
of hand-to-hand combat (Deas 1870; Grant 1885;
Longstreet 1912; Smith 1917). Surprisingly, there is
no direct evidence of bayonet injuries on any of the
skeletons since bayonets were considered the best
line of defense by both armies. The bayonet used by
U.S. troops had a triangular blade (Haecker 1994;
Haecker and Mauck 1997). Most of the cut marks
RQ?WKH?VNHOHWDO?UHPDLQV?DUH?QRQVSHFLÀF??EXW?WKH?PRUH?
evident ones are consistent with sword or saber
cuts rather than bayonet wounds. The lack of sharp

force wounds on the forearms, which often indicate
defense injuries (Novak 2000), is also surprising.
A number of individuals appear to have blade
and ballistic wounds on the lower limb bones, and
Burial No. 4, for example, has multiple piercing
wounds to the abdomen consistent with a shotgun
injury. The direction of the wounds suggests the
soldier was at a higher elevation than the shooter.

and the direction of blade and projectile wounds on

as sharp force trauma to the left clavicle and left

projectile wounds on both shoulders and numerous
small puncture wounds on the pelvis and lumbar

In 2004 and 2006–2007, personnel from Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted testing and data recovery
excavations at the Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15), a mostly Late Caddo ceremonial and civic center, in Harrison

a core ceremonial area with earthen mounds, off-mound structures, and a cemetery situated around a plaza, as
well as eight possible village areas around the core area. The 2006–2007 data recovery excavations in three of
the possible village areas revealed that two contained the remains of multi-generational household compounds,
while the third probably was used as an activity area and likely did not contain domiciles. The two phases of

ceramic vessels from mortuary contexts, 46,378 ceramic sherds from non-burial contexts, 6,095 lithic artifacts,
more than 10,000 animal bones, and about 1.5 kg of botanical remains.
The work at the Pine Tree Mound site documents the archeology and history of a community of Caddo Indians
whose homeland was centered in the Potters Creek valley of the middle Sabine River basin, starting in the A.D.
1300s and continuing till at least the mid- 1600s, and perhaps through most of the 1700s. This community was

This group was known as the Nadaco Caddo by the eighteenth century, and we equate the Pine Tree Mound
community with the home territory of that group, the descendants of which live in Oklahoma today.

This article presents an overview of testing and
data recovery excavations at the Pine Tree Mound
site, a ceremonial and civic complex that the Caddo
occupied from sometime in the A.D. 1300s to the
1700s in what is today south-central Harrison
County, Texas. This project has done much to further an understanding of the prehistory of a part of
northeast Texas, while at the same time resulting
in the long-term preservation of a rich body of archeological evidence relating to the Caddo Indians,
who lived in this region of northeast Texas, southeast Oklahoma, southwest Arkansas, and northwest
Louisiana for 1,000 years, from about A.D. 800 to
the early 1800s. Their descendants make up the
Caddo Nation of Oklahoma today.
This project is notable in two respects. First,
archeologists had the rare opportunity to conduct
well-funded excavations across the entirety of the
complex, including both the ceremonial core and the
surrounding residential areas. Second, in 2006 the
heart of the site was donated to the Archaeological

Conservancy and thus is protected from future disturbance. The work was done by Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., under two contracts with the Sabine Mining
Company (SMC), which is a subsidiary of the North
American Coal Corporation, and was prompted by
the planned expansion of the Sabine Mine. The
mine is a lignite operation that produces fuel for the
H. W. Pirkey Power Plant nearby. The plant is operated by American Electric Power (AEP), which was
the ultimate funding source for the project. AEP’s
commitment to the project extended well beyond
funding the archeological work, however; they also
volunteered to purchase part of the site and donate it
to the Conservancy for preservation.
The project was completed in two phases. The
entirety of the site was tested through the excavation
of 143 backhoe trenches in June through August
2004. That project resulted in a recommendation that
the site is eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places. When it was determined that the
cost of data recovery would exceed the value of the
lignite under the site, SMC altered its mining plans

and activity areas bordering the core on the west and
south. The three residential loci and activity areas
at the west edge of the site could not be avoided,
however, and Prewitt and Associates completed data
recovery excavations there in April 2006 through
January 2007; these excavations covered about
14,560 m2 (Figure 1).
The work at Pine Tree Mound is important
because it documents the rich archeology and history of a little-known community of Caddo Indians
whose homeland was in the Potters Creek valley
of the middle Sabine River basin, starting in the
A.D. 1300s and continuing till at least the mid1600s, and perhaps through most of the 1700s. This

province, by the remnants of the Hernando de Soto
expedition as it traveled south on the Hasinai Trace
through Caddo country in 1542. We believe this
is the group known as the Nadaco Caddo by the
eighteenth century, and after that the Anadarko
Caddo, and thus we equate the Pine Tree Mound
community with the home territory of that group,
the descendants of which live in Oklahoma today.
The excavations reported here concern just one
site, but it was a most important site. This is where
the community leaders and elite members lived and
conducted the ceremonies and rituals that bound
the community together. By drawing in information from other nearby Caddo sites, we are able to
look beyond this one ceremonial center and address
not only topics dealing with mundane aspects of
their daily lives—for example, how they built their
houses, how they organized their household compounds, what kinds of crops they grew, and what
animals they hunted—but also questions relating
WR?WKH?FRQÀJXUDWLRQ?RI?WKH?FRPPXQLW\?DV?D?ZKROH??
As a result, the archeology of Pine Tree Mound
provides new perspectives on the nature of the
Nadaco community’s religious and cosmological
beliefs and how those beliefs may have connected
them, socially and politically, to their neighbors.
All of this new information provides insights into
who the Nadaco Caddo were.
This article consists mostly of the final synthetic chapter taken from the technical report on
the excavations (Fields and Gadus 2012), with
enough introductory material added to provide
a context for that synthesis. As such, it does not
contain much specific information about the excavations or what was found. For such information,
the interested reader should refer to the technical
report.

Test excavations consisted of two 1 x 1 m
units and 143 backhoe trenches totaling 1,267 m
in length. Three of the trenches were in the three
mounds evident on the surface of the site, and the
other 140 trenches were situated to look for offmound features such as houses, non-residential
structures, and cemeteries. The test excavations
resulted in the documentation of 202 features,
exclusive of the three mounds, including postholes, pits, hearths, burials, a buried midden, and
a buried structure, and recovered 1,816 artifacts,
mostly sherds from ceramic vessels. The distributions of the trenches with features, the trenches

The data recovery excavations were in three of
the possible villages areas—Areas 2, 3, and 8—at
the west edge of the site. In total, 60 backhoe
trenches were dug, 13,500 m2 of plow zone were
removed mechanically, and 282 sample units of
various sizes were excavated manually or by machine and screened. More than 3,100 features were

their associated ancillary structures and activity
areas, but also including 27 Caddo burials.
Area 2 contained two house compounds, a
northern one (Area 2N) with 18 structures and a
southern one (Area 2S) with 11 structures (Figure
4). Also found here was a small cemetery with 13
graves set off from the house compounds, as well
as three isolated graves in and among the houses,
one small grave was very close to the wall of a
southern compound house and thus is hard to see
in Figure 4). One of these graves was a multiple
interment containing two individuals. These
graves were rich in funerary objects, containing
98 ceramic vessels, five ceramic pipes, 21 arrow
points, three celts, two pairs of ear spools, and a
grinding slab. Area 8 was very similar to Area 2,
except that it contained only one compound with
nine house patterns (Figure 5). It also contained
a small cemetery with eight graves situated closer
to the houses than in Area 2, and it contained
three isolated graves around the houses as well.
Funerary objects from this part of the site included 47 ceramic vessels, two ceramic pipes, 29
arrow points, one pair of ear spools, and a stone
knapper’s tool kit. One grave in the cemetery
also contained two individuals. Area 3 contained
far fewer features than Areas 2 and 8, and thus it
appears to represent a large outdoor activity area
rather than a domiciliary locale.
Analysis of the artifacts recovered in the
2004 and 2006–2007 excavations, including the

grave goods listed above and a large collection
of materials donated by avocational archeologist
Macky McIntosh, resulted in documentation of
150 ceramic vessels, more than 46,000 sherds, 27
ceramic pipes and fragments, one ceramic bead,
one ceramic earplug, and two ceramic spindle
whorls. Just over half the sherds are brushed, while
6 percent are engraved and 7 percent are incised;
one-third are undecorated. Ripley Engraved,
Wilder Engraved, and Pease Brushed-Incised are
the predominant ceramic types; minor types include Belcher Ridged, Cass Appliqued, Cowhide

Karnack Brushed-Incised, La Rue Neck Banded,

The Radiocarbon Evidence
There are a number of limitations to the radiocarbon evidence from Pine Tree Mound, including
too few samples from primary contexts, the long
spans of some of the intervals, and the multiple
intercepts of many of the dates. Figure 6, which
shows the two-sigma calibrated ranges for all 105
dates obtained, illustrates the latter two of these
problems. More importantly, though, it highlights

the robust nature of the data set. Just two dates are
wholly outside the range of the others, both on the
early end. One of these, on organic residue from a
vessel in burial Feature 2.2073, is about 800 years
too old. The other, on organic residue from a vessel

in burial Feature 8.1088, is probably at least 200
years too old. A third date overlaps the early end
of the predominant range slightly, but based on its
context it is clearly too old as well, probably by at
least 125 years.

On the late end, there are 12 dates with intervals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that,

but one are from contexts (smudge pits) or are on
materials (corn and cane) that leave little doubt
about their Native American origins, and all also
have intervals in the sixteenth, seventeenth, or
eighteenth centuries and hence relate to late use
of the site. The last period of use, perhaps in the
mid-A.D. 1700s, represents the terminus of a ca.
400-year span, beginning in the 1300s, when the
Caddo settled on the ridge between Potters and

Starkey Creeks, established a plaza with adjoining ceremonial buildings, and ringed this central
ceremonial precinct with residential areas.

obtained by focusing on the one-sigma ranges of
the 102 dates that are not erroneously early rather
than the two-sigma ones; paying attention to relative
probabilities for dates with multiple intervals, and
disregarding intervals with very low probabilities;
carefully evaluating contexts to determine if particular intervals or parts of intervals make more sense

cases resulting in shorter intervals, where we have
multiple dates representing single events or multiple
events closely spaced in time, judging from context.
This allowed us to boil the radiocarbon evidence
down to 76 dated contexts, 15 in the core part of the
site and 61 in village areas (Figure 7).

The graphs in Figure 7 are similar in two important ways: (1) both start in the A.D. 1300s; and
(2) both have the largest number of samples in the
1400s and into the early 1500s. They are dissimilar in
that the one for the village areas has samples clearly
postdating 1600 while the one for the core area does
not. These patterns indicate the following: (1) initial

use of the site for ceremonial and residential activities
was contemporaneous, commencing sometime in the
1300s; (2) the most intensive use for both ceremonial
and residential purposes was in the 1400s and early
1500s; and (3) use of residential areas continued later
than use of the ceremonial area. The last of these is
the least-supported conclusion, since far fewer dates
were obtained from the ceremonial part of the site,
and it is possible that use of that area continued but
without substantial construction that resulted in radiocarbon evidence. The difference in the late ends
of the two graphs is striking nonetheless.

developed, the dated contexts are assigned to eight
temporal intervals: A.D. 1300s, early 1400s, mid1400s, late 1400s, late 1400s–early 1500s, mid–
late 1500s, 1600s, and 1700s (Table 1). The earliest
and three latest ones are mutually exclusive, while
the four in the middle (early 1400s through late

1400s–early 1500s) overlap to varying degrees.
This effort is complicated by ambiguities in some
of the radiocarbon dates, but based on probabilities and contexts, it is possible to assign all but

occupations in the late 1400s–early 1500s or the
late 1500s–early 1600s, but there is no contextual
evidence allowing them to be pushed one way or
the other. For the one date from Area 5, this is the
case partly because it is the only dated feature from
that part of the site, although probabilities alone
suggest it could be assigned to the earlier interval.
The four dated contexts restricted to the
A.D. 1300s are from Area 8 and the core area; the
latter come from the bottom of Mound C and what
is probably a burned structure south of Mound C.
This initial period of use is not dated very tightly,

of the century than the latter half, with the highestprobability intervals overlapping at 1313–1357. If
this is correct, the limited number of dates suggests
a gradual start for residential and ceremonial activities, given that all other dated contexts are later
than 1400. Of course, it is possible that this picture
would be different if we had more samples from
the core area and other unexcavated village areas.
The A.D. 1400s history of the site is hard to
unravel because of the overlapping ranges of the
LQWHUYDOV? ZLWKLQ? LW? DQG? WKH? GLIÀFXOW\? RI? DVVLJQLQJ?
some contexts. However, of the 13 contexts that
DSSHDU?WR?GDWH?WR?WKH?ÀUVW?KDOI?RI?WKH?FHQWXU\??VHYHQ?
are in Area 8 and four are in the core area. The
latter are from features intrusive into the top of
Mound C, a pit and burial in the cemetery at the
north end of the plaza, and a feature representing structures east of Mound A. Two of the Area
8 contexts are burials, while the others represent
domiciliary activities. Feature 2.011 in Area 2N
and burial Feature 2.2079 indicate use of Area 2
for domiciliary and mortuary purposes during this
interval as well. There are some dates from Area 2S
WKDW?FRXOG?UHÁHFW?UHVLGHQWLDO?XVH?LQ?WKH?HDUO\?????V??
but overlap in most of the early dates from this part
of the site suggests initial village occupation began
there around the middle of the 15th century.
Twenty-nine contexts appear to date to the late
A.D. 1400s into the early 1500s. They are well
represented in the Area 2 cemetery, the Area 2N
village, the Area 8 village and cemetery, and the
core area. Table 1 lists no contexts for this interval
in the Area 2S village, but it is possible that several
of those shown there as earlier (Features 2.1327,
2.1689b, and 2.1689c) actually belong with this
later interval. Most of the core area contexts in
this group are associated with Mound B and the
various structures in trenches just north and south
of Mound B, as well as a likely structure across the
plaza north of Mound C. Taken together, the contexts that relate to use from the early 1400s through
the early 1500s account for almost two-thirds of all
dated contexts; this was when the Pine Tree Mound
site was occupied most intensively.
Nine contexts appear to represent occupation
in the mid A.D. 1500s and latter half of that century. These are in the Area 2N, 2S, and 8 villages,
Area 3, and the core area. The fact that this is the
earliest date from Area 3 suggests any earlier use
was of a kind that did not result in any datable

Mound B. This almost certainly does not relate to
the last use of the mound, however, and the chronology of this component of the ceremonial part
of the site remains poorly known. That said, the
radiocarbon evidence could be interpreted as indiFDWLQJ?WKDW?WKH?=RQH???ÀOO?GRHV?QRW?SRVWGDWH?WKH?ÀUVW?
quarter of the 1500s, and in this scenario it would
seem likely that any mound surfaces above Zone
7, while later, still probably date no later than the
sixteenth century.

comparatively few samples. Five contexts appear
to date to the A.D. 1600s, four in Area 2S and one
in Area 3. Those in Area 2S suggest village occupation there in the middle decades of the century. The
Area 3 date indicates contemporaneous use of that
part of the site. Finally, three dates imply limited
use of Areas 2N and 2S in the 1700s. These three
do not form a very coherent group, but two overlap
in the 1720s and the third may relate to use in the
last few decades of the century.
Figure 8 shows graphically how the site developed over time, plotting the dated contexts in
each area by interval as a percentage of those that
can be assigned. Because of the overlap in the four
middle intervals (early A.D. 1400s–early 1500s),
they are lumped together. The Area 2 cemetery is
graphed separately from the Area 2 villages since
associations are uncertain; this is not the case for
the Area 8 village and burial contexts, which are
lumped. These graphs depict the founding of the
Pine Tree Mound community in the 1300s with
simultaneous creation of the ceremonial precinct
and establishment of a village in Area 8. There
is no indication of residential occupation in Area
2 at that time. All three villages (Areas 2N, 2S,
and 8) saw intensive use in the 1400s and early
1500s with 62, 42, and 82 percent of their dates
in this interval, as did the core area with 80 percent; the Area 2 cemetery appears to go with these
occupations as well. As noted above, it is likely
that the Area 5 village dates at least partly to this
interval. Modest numbers of contexts in the three
village areas and the core area indicate continued
use of all four areas through the 1500s, although
apparently at a quieter pace than before. One of
the two dates from Area 3 suggests this is when
that part of the site was used first. Use after 1600
was much more restricted areally. Evidence for
occupation in the seventeenth century comes only
from Areas 2S and 3, while dates indicating use

The Artifact Evidence
The temporally sensitive artifacts do not add a
great deal to this discussion, since they generally
support the picture given by the radiocarbon dates.
The small collection of dart points, consisting of

specimens typed as Edgewood, Ellis, Gary, Palmer,
Palmillas, Trinity, Wells, and Yarbrough, as well as
some untyped forms, probably relates to intermittent, low-intensity use of the landform before the
Caddo settled there and thus is not associated with
the Pine Tree Mound community. This also may be
true for the few minor arrow point styles—Alba,
Bonham, Alba-Bonham, and Friley—which could
go with some ephemeral use during Early Caddo

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
or Woodland times. The absence of ceramics such
as Williams Plain, Coles Creek Incised, Marksville
Stamped, or Tchefuncte Stamped, and the very
UDUH?RFFXUUHQFH?RI?(DUO\?&DGGR?SRWWHU\? MXVW?ÀYH?
sherds typed as Pennington Punctated-Incised, all
from the core area), indicate that any such use was
insubstantial, though.
The diagnostic artifacts that do go with occupation of the village and ceremonial areas consist
of arrow points typed as Perdiz, Perdiz-Bassett, and
Bassett and ceramics typed as Ripley Engraved,
Pease Brushed-Incised, Wilder Engraved, Harleton

of occupation, and there is nothing in their spatial

However, there are some puzzling absences
from the list of ceramic types given the evidence
for very late use of Areas 2N and 2S. Most notable
among these are Simms Engraved and Natchitoches
Engraved, which are common on Kinsloe phase
sites in this area. Their apparent absence here may
be due to the fact that most of the sherds are highly
fragmented and thus hard to identify to type, or
perhaps because almost all that is known about
Kinsloe phase ceramic assemblages comes from
burials rather than village contexts. Regardless, the

Fresno arrow point from Area 2 clearly point to occupation of that part of the site during the 1700s, and
a strong case can be made for some sort of continuity
with the earlier occupations there. One interpretation
is that Area 2 was used in a very limited way in the
A.D. 1700s by Caddo people who mostly lived elsewhere but who had some knowledge of the former
village and chose to do things there in some of the
same places where houses once sat. These people

A.D. 1300s, involved a slow start to residential

and ceremonial activities. By the early 1400s and
continuing through the early 1500s, residential
activities were widespread and intensive, as was
use of one part of the site for ceremonial activities.
These patterns continued through the 1500s, but
in a less-intensive fashion than before. One area
continued to be used for residential activities into
the mid-1600s, but it appears that ritual-associated
construction was no longer taking place in the
core area. The focus of such activities had shifted
HOVHZKHUH? E\? WKHQ??7KH? ÀQDO? VWDJH?? LQ? WKH? ????V??
may have little to do with what came before. Area
2 saw residential use, but it was not intensive and
may have been by people whose main villages
were elsewhere. Any connections to the Pine Tree
Mound community that thrived there in the 1400s
and 1500s may have been based only on oral traditions and distant memories. It is even possible that
there were no connections at all, with the latest occupations having been short-term stays by Caddo
or non-Caddo people traveling through the area.
There is little doubt that many visitors passed
Pine Tree Mound during the eighteenth century,
for it is close to the route of Trammel’s Trace, a
historic trail laid out by 1813 to connect Nacogdoches with the Red River and the main route from
the north into east Texas at that time (Pirtle 2011).
Trammel’s Trace followed an existing Indian trail
known as the Hasinai Trace. Recent research by
Bob Vernon of the Texas Archeological Stewards
Network and Gary Pinkerton (http://www.trammels
trace.org) indicates that these trails passed close by
3LQH?7UHH??8VLQJ?7H[DV?*HQHUDO?/DQG?2IÀFH?FRXQW\?
KHDGULJKW?PDSV?DQG?RULJLQDO?VXUYH\RUV·?ÀHOG?QRWHV??
they have been able to plot the primary route of
Trammel’s Trace with some precision across most
of Harrison County. According to that plotting,
the trace ran 1.4 km east of Pine Tree Mound on
its southwestward course to the Ramsdale Ferry
crossing of the Sabine, about 9.3 km southwest of
the site (see Figure 10 below).
Of particular relevance to the history of the
Pine Tree Mound community is the fact that the
remnants of the Hernando de Soto expedition, led
by Luis de Moscoso after de Soto’s death, likely
followed the Hasinai Trace when they entered
Texas in July A.D. 1542. Numerous researchers
have examined possible routes for the Moscoso
expedition in Texas (e.g., Bruseth and Kenmotsu
1993; Hudson 1993; Kenmotsu et al. 1993; Perttula
1992:19–27; Schambach 1993; Strickland 1942;

1942), a task complicated by two things. First,
this part of the journey is documented in only the
Elvas (Robertson 1933) and Biedma (Bourne 1904)
accounts without any corroborating information
from the Ranjel narrative, which is missing for the
period after November 1541 and was the “best and
most detailed of all the de Soto documents on the
GD\?WR?GD\?PRYHPHQWV?RI?WKH?DUP\µ? 6FKDPEDFK?
1993:79). Second, what was documented was
sketchy, perhaps because the much-diminished
H[SHGLWLRQ? ZDV? IRFXVHG? RQ? ÀQGLQJ? DQ? HQG? WR? WKH?
journey rather than recording their movements and
observations.
Some have argued that the expedition entered
Texas after moving west across northern Louisiana,
but the most-critical studies conclude convincingly that the army traveled across southwestern
Arkansas before crossing the Red River. While
Schambach (1993:86–90) places Naguatex, the
ÀUVW?&DGGR?SURYLQFH?DORQJ?WKH?5HG?HQFRXQWHUHG?E\?
the expedition, in southwestern Arkansas east of
Texarkana, Bruseth and Kenmotsu (1993:210–212)
conclude it more likely was above the Great Bend
northwest of Texarkana. Either way, it is clear that
upon leaving Naguatex Moscoso and his men followed an existing trail southward into Caddo country. Bruseth and Kenmotsu (1993:213) suggest that
WKH? ÀUVW? WZR? &DGGR? SURYLQFHV? WKH? H[SHGLWLRQ? HQcountered after leaving Naguatex—Nissohone and
Lacane—were on the trace near where it crossed
the Sulphur River and Big Cypress Creek, and that
the third province—Nondacao—was on the Sabine
River, in the vicinity of the Pine Tree Mound site.
According to Chafe (1993:223), Nondacao comes

SODFH?RI?WKH?EXPEOHEHHµ?RU?WKH?SHRSOH?RI?WKDW?SODFH?
There is nothing in the entrada accounts that
conclusively places Nondacao in the vicinity of
Pine Tree Mound. The Biedma account is particularly uninformative about this, and all that is
said in the Elvas account (Robertson 1933) is the
following: “Two days later, he reached another
wretched land called Lacane. There he captured
an Indian who said that the land of Nondacao
was a very populous region and the houses scattered about one from another as is customary in
mountains, and that there was an abundance of
maize. The cacique [of Nondacao] and his Indians
came weeping like those of Naguatex, that being
their custom in token of obedience. He made him

that these comments present certainly would be
consistent with the archeology of the Pine Tree
Mound vicinity, but probably no more so than
many other parts of the Caddo area. In fact, there
LV?QR?VSHFLÀF?PHQWLRQ?WKDW?0RVFRVR?DFWXDOO\?VDZ?
the Nondacao settlement, since it sounds like the
cacique came to meet Moscoso (on the Hasinai
Trace?), and there is no indication that the expedition members stayed at Nondacao for any time at
all. Nontheless, Bruseth and Kenmotsu’s (1993)
reconstruction seems sound, relying as it does on
multiple lines of evidence. Assuming that Moscoso
and his party traveled down the Hasinai Trace, it
is inconceivable that the Spaniards and Portuguese
and the Pine Tree Mound Caddo remained unaware
of one another.
We do not know if this encounter, brief as it
was, relates in any way to the changes evident at
the Pine Tree Mound site starting in the latter half
of the A.D. 1500s. It is easy to imagine that it did,
though, with that contact resulting in population
loss from introduced infectious diseases.

The history presented above begs two questions. Where did the Pine Tree Mound Caddo come
IURP??DQG?ZKDW?KDSSHQHG?WR?WKHP"?3DUW?RI?WKH?ÀUVW?
question has an easy answer, in that there is no
archeological evidence for substantial Caddo occupation of the Potters and Starkey Creek valleys
predating Pine Tree Mound. Hence, the people
who settled there in the A.D. 1300s were not local to the immediate area. This is indicated by the
fact that just a handful of possible Early to Middle
Caddo sherds (Pennington Punctated-Incised) and
arrow points (Alba, Bonham, Alba-Bonham, and
maybe Friley) were found at Pine Tree, suggesting ephemeral use at most. Similar sparse Early to
Middle Caddo artifacts have been found at three
tested sites nearby. Site 41HS846 not far to the
south yielded a few possible Kiam and Dunkin
Incised sherds and Bonham, Steiner, and Friley
arrow points (Gadus et al. 2006:130), but most of
the Caddo remains there are later and contemporaneous with Pine Tree. Site 41HS718, also to the
south, yielded a few early arrow points (Bonham
and Scallorn), but the pottery clearly ties this site
with the main occupation at Pine Tree (Gadus

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
et al. 2006:81–91, 130). Finally, 41HS574 just to
the east had a single radiocarbon date that could
slightly predate Pine Tree, with an early two-sigma
range of 1270–1320, but it also has a later range of
1340–1390 that is contemporaneous with the initial
occupation of the ceremonial precinct and Area 8;
further, the ceramics tie this site to Pine Tree (Gadus et al. 2006:130, 172). In short, Caddo groups
used the ridge between Potters and Starkey Creeks
during the centuries preceding the founding of the
Pine Tree Mound site, but that use was limited in
kind and intensity, too limited to see it as directly
ancestral to the Pine Tree Mound community.

(41HS16) on Potters Creek 1.6 km south of Pine
Tree supports the conclusion of sparse Caddo occupation here before settlement of Pine Tree Mound
(Figure 9). Resch yielded a fair number of early
arrow points (Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Colbert,
and Friley; Webb et al. 1969:55–56), but most are
Frileys and go with the strong Woodland component
there. Much of the pottery also probably goes with
this early occupation, including examples of Williams Plain, Tchefuncte Plain and Stamped, Alexander Pinched, Troyville Stamped, and Marksville
Stamped, although there are some sherds of Coles
Creek Incised, Hickory Engraved, and Davis InFLVHG?WKDW?ÀW?EHWWHU?ZLWK?RFFXSDWLRQ?GXULQJ?WKH?(DUO\?
Caddo period (Webb et al. 1969:32–40). Resch
probably has the most substantial Caddo component
predating Pine Tree among the tested and excavated
sites in the vicinity, but it seems too early to be
related directly to it and not substantial enough to
represent an occupation by settled Caddo villagers.
The Caddo component at Resch may well be
a campsite or non-residential outlier associated
with the Early Caddo ceremonial and civic center
at the Hudnall-Pirtle site on the south side of the
Sabine River, ca. 14 km southwest of Pine Tree
Mound (see Figure 9). Hudnall-Pirtle yielded four
radiocarbon dates, three of which suggest it was
occupied between A.D. 980 and 1265 (Bruseth and
Perttula 2006:74, 78, 81, 82, 147–148), although
some of the ceramic assemblage looks earlier, and
a longer span than this years would be expected
given its size (1,100 x 400 m) and complexity
(eight constructed mounds, a plaza, three borrow
pits, and multiple residential areas). Alba, Catahoula, Colbert, and Steiner are the main arrow
point styles, with Friley and Scallorn points being
minor types and just single examples of Perdiz and
Bassett (Bruseth and Perttula 2006:100–107). The

39

FHUDPLFV?DUH?ÀUPO\?(DUO\?&DGGR??FRQVLVWLQJ?RI?WKH?
types Coles Creek Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Davis Incised, Hickory Fine Engraved, Holly
Fine Engraved, Kiam Incised, Pennington Punctated-Incised, Spiro Engraved, and Weches Fingernail
Impressed (Bruseth and Perttula 2006:82–95).
Based on the radiocarbon evidence, Hudnall-Pirtle
might be seen as a good candidate for a community
that was ancestral to the one at Pine Tree Mound.
There are two arguments against this, however.
First, the dates suggest a lapse of perhaps a century
between abandonment of Hudnall-Pirtle and occupation of Pine Tree, especially the main period
of use of the latter. Second, the ceramics from the
two sites are dramatically dissimilar, suggesting
they are the products of different traditions.
What is missing at Hudnall-Pirtle that would
make it a better candidate for an ancestral community are remains bridging the Early and Late Caddo
intervals. Just such remains are present at two other
nearby excavated sites, though, and this is where
we may need to look to understand how Pine Tree
Mound came to be. The better-understood of these
two is the Oak Hill Village site in Rusk County,
35 km southwest of Pine Tree and 21 km southwest
of Hudnall-Pirtle (see Figure 9). Oak Hill Village
is a large site with evidence of about 40 structures
and one mound (Rogers and Perttula 2004). Radiocarbon dates indicate a main Caddo occupation between A.D. 1150 and 1450, with the most intensive
village occupation, including construction of the
mound and arrangement of houses around a plaza,
after 1250 (Rogers and Perttula 2004:345–347).
Arrow points consist of both early forms (Alba
and Bonham) and later ones (Perdiz, Bassett, and
Perdiz/Bassett) (Rogers and Perttula 2004:167–
175). The ceramics are quite varied, with most of

(Rogers and Perttula 2004:211–258).
The second site, 41HS74, is on Hatley Creek,
a northern tributary of the Sabine River, 8 km west
of Pine Tree Mound and 8 km north-northeast of

it does appear that 41HS74 contains one or more
substantial components that predate Pine Tree
Mound, though perhaps not by much. Some of the
artifacts point to some temporal overlap with Pine
Tree as well.
What Oak Hill Village and 41HS74 suggest is
that abandonment of the Hudnall-Pirtle complex
in the A.D. 1200s was associated with decentralization of political and religious authority in the
middle Sabine basin, with residential sites that
were scattered throughout the countryside, and that
were occupied initially during the height of Hudnall-Pirtle’s power and probably were connected to
it, perhaps gaining greater autonomy. This would
explain not only the artifact assemblages at these
two sites, but also the mound built at Oak Hill Village after 1250. Perttula (2004b:40) sees the events
of the Middle Caddo period in the middle Sabine
basin as being typical of what was happening
across the Caddo area at that time, representing the
establishment of “many independent social comPXQLWLHV?µ?ZKLFK?KH?WLHV?WR?LQWHQVLÀFDWLRQ?RI?PDL]H?
agriculture and “loosening [of] the longstanding
ties between the public and ritual, and the secular
DQG?UHVLGHQWLDO??DW?OHDVW?DW?WKH?UHJLRQDO?VFDOH?µ
The evidence that these region-wide changes
in Caddo society in the A.D. 1200–1400 interval were associated with changes in agricultural
economies is strong, but they also appear to have
been connected to political changes. In the Early
Caddo period, the elites who lived and ultimately
were buried at sites such as George C. Davis and
Gahagan, and almost certainly Hudnall-Pirtle,
may have derived their authority from an ability
to operate within a far-reaching exchange network. Clearly, they had the capacity to acquire
and control symbols of power that were exotic to
the Caddo area, as represented by things such as
marine shell cups, gorgets, and beads; Gahagan
bifaces and arrow points fashioned from non-local
chert; large spatula-shaped celts; copper artifacts;
PDVVHV? RI? JDOHQD?? DQG? VWRQH? HIÀJ\? SLSHV? *LUDUG?
2010:201–202; Story 1997; Webb and Dodd 1939).
These were part of a corpus of themes and motifs
that helped foster local political elites across the
Mississippian world (Brown et al. 1990:255–272;
Knight 1986; Mann 1986:22–23). However, Muller
(1995:320) posits that after 1300 the use of these
symbols, especially as fashioned from exotic
materials, became attenuated. This seems to have

41

engendered regionalization in long-used cultural
themes and motifs (Reilly and Garber 2007:3).
For the Caddo, this involved changes in political
regionalism, which were given expression on the
canvas of locally made ceramic vessels.
The slow start to the development of the Pine
Tree Mound site can be seen as the infancy of one
local political elite, starting in the A.D. 1300s and
accelerating after 1400. However, we suggest that
the Pine Tree Mound community was settled by
Caddo people who already lived in the vicinity,
just not much in the Potters Creek valley itself.
Because excavated sites are few, it is hard to say
much about how large an area they occupied before creating Pine Tree, but the two sites noted
above (Oak Hill Village and 41HS74) suggest it
could have been sizeable, encompassing tributary
valleys both north and south of the Sabine River.
Hudnall-Pirtle may not have been directly ancestral
to Pine Tree Mound, but it is possible that what
came out of Hudnall-Pirtle eventually recrystallized, in a different political form, into the Pine
Tree Mound community. One intriguing piece of
evidence that could tie these two sites together is
the poorly known Lane Mitchell site, which lies
9.3 km southwest of Pine Tree and 3.8 km northeast
of Hudnall-Pirtle (see Figure 9).
/DQH? 0LWFKHOO? FRQWDLQV? IRXU? RU? ÀYH? VPDOO?
mounds and a borrow pit, with the mounds arrayed
roughly linearly for a distance of about 130 m
atop the bluff overlooking the Hatley Creek valley just north of where it meets the Sabine River
ÁRRGSODLQ??7KHUH?LV?QR?REYLRXV?SOD]D??DOWKRXJK?WRR?
little work has been done there to say much about
the overall site layout, and the mounds seem not to
be associated with numerous surrounding village
areas like Pine Tree, judging from the survey data.
Limited excavations in 1919–1920 (Pearce 1919,
1920) and again in 1998 (Keller 2000) indicate
that most or all of the mounds contain burned
structures, presumably ceremonial in nature. Based
on examination of the ceramics from the early excavations, Thurmond (1981:48–49) suggests that
the site dates to the Late Caddo period, making it
contemporaneous with the Pine Tree Mound site.
Recent examination of 189 sherds collected from
the surface in the 1998 work supports this conclusion, based on the low plain to decorated sherd
ratio of 0.6 to 1 and the high percentage of brushing
among the decorated sherds (62 percent). Just how
Pine Tree Mound and Lane Mitchell are related is
unknown, but the fact that the latter sits astride a

We have already alluded to what may have
happened to the people who lived at the Pine Tree
Mound site after its heyday in the A.D. 1400s and
1500s, with at least part of the answer potentially
lying in an archeological construct proposed in
the 1960s by Buddy Calvin Jones: the Kinsloe
phase (Jones 1968). He defined this construct
to account for a series of sites in Gregg, Rusk,
and Harrison counties where graves containing
Caddo pottery and historic trade materials had
been found. Jones (1968:211–212) concluded
that these sites, dating perhaps as early as the
late seventeenth century and as late as the early
nineteenth century, could be related to several
named Caddo groups, with the most likely one
being the Nadaco, or the descendants of the Nondacao Caddo who Moscoso met in 1542 (Perttula
2007). One branch of the Nadaco apparently had
moved south into the Angelina River basin to be
near the Hasinai Caddo by 1717, but the account
of Pedro Vial’s journey indicates that a northern
branch was still living in this part of the Sabine
basin in 1788, occupying a village with 13–15
houses scattered over a distance of 3 leagues, or
about 13 km (Perttula 1992:175–177).
The Kinsloe phase included the following
sites: Ware Acres (41GG31) near Longview in
southern Gregg County; Kinsloe (41GG3) near
Kilgore in southern Gregg County; Cherokee
Lake (41RK132) in northern Rusk County southeast of Kilgore; Millsey Williamson (41RK3) in
Rusk County southwest of Tatum; C. D. Marsh
(41HS269) on Eightmile Creek about 1.6 km north
RI?ZKHUH?LW?ÁRZV?LQWR?WKH?6DELQH?5LYHU?LQ?VRXWKern Harrison County; and Susie Slade (41HS13)
and Henry Brown No. 1 (41HS261) in southern
Harrison County. The latter two are quite close
to Pine Tree Mound, just 2.1 and 4.3 km south
of it on Potters Creek (Figure 10). Along with
two other similar sites nearby, they may mark the
locales where the people of the Pine Tree Mound

community lived after they abandoned the village
at 41HS15. One of the other sites is Henry Brown
No. 2 (41HS262), which is just across Potters
Creek from Henry Brown No. 1. The other is
41HS770, which is on Potters Creek between the
Susie Slade and Henry Brown sites (see Figure 10).
These four sites span a 2.2-km-long north-south
segment of the Potters Creek valley.
The problem with determining if and how
these sites are connected to Pine Tree Mound is that
none are well documented. Most of what we know
about the Susie Slade site is based on information
Jones gathered from individuals who looted it in
1962, although Jones did excavate three burials
there, and personnel with the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (of The University of Texas at
Austin) removed two others (Jones 1968:98–125;
Scurlock 1962). Looters reportedly excavated some
50 graves at Susie Slade, most in an area ca. 50 m
in diameter. The burials were 6–13 ft apart in a
checkerboard pattern, suggesting a planned cemetery. Most had single individuals, though one or
two had two people. The interments were extended
with heads to the east or southeast. Bone preservation was good in several but poor in most. Almost

one without historic materials had 25 vessels. Green
and gray pigments were common as offerings. Small
quantities of historic materials were found in about
15 graves, typically one or two strings of beads or
one or two metal items per grave.
The three burials that Jones excavated consisted of the following: (1) a male with head to the
east accompanied by seven vessels, glass beads, an
iron knife, a polishing stone, and red and green pigments; (1) a female with head to the east accompanied by eight vessels, conch shell beads, gray pigment, and a deer jaw; and (3) a male with head to
the southeast accompanied by seven vessels. Jones

J. Dan Scurlock and other personnel with the
Texas Archeological Salvage Project excavated
two burials at Susie Slade, also in 1962. One was
a previously dug grave that Scurlock reopened to
recover bones; it was oriented with head to the
east and contained glass beads, conch shell beads,
and a Fresno point that the looters had left behind.

The other also had an eastward orientation and

Another grave was documented during this effort

by looters. It also was oriented to the east, and it
contained at least six vessels (three are described
as Simms Engraved, Hodges Engraved, and a plain
miniature bottle). Scurlock examined the collections held by two of the looters, which consisted

punctated, 3 neck banded, and 1 appliquéd, with
some typed as Taylor Engraved, Patton Engraved,
Natchitoches Engraved, and Hodges Engraved.
The Henry Brown No. 1 site consists of a small
cemetery and possible village areas nearby (Jones
1968:126–155). Nine burials were found there,
two excavated by looters in 1962 and seven dug by
Jones in 1963 and 1965. The graves were 3–15 ft
apart and, as at Susie Slade, in a checkerboard
pattern. The only one containing bones had the
head oriented to the east. The other grave pits were
oriented similarly, though (three to the east, four to
the southeast, and one unknown). Virtually nothing is known about one of the two looted graves,
except that it contained several ceramic vessels and
no historic materials. The other eight graves were
reported to contain 3–14 ceramic vessels each, with
two graves having three elbow pipes, one grave
having a large chert knife and 28 bipointed knives,
one grave having seven Fresno arrow points and
one Scallorn point, one grave having red pigment,
two graves containing three iron knife blades or arrow points, and two graves containing glass beads.
Historic materials, consisting of single strings of
glass beads or small iron objects, were found in a

Punctated, 3 Natchitoches Engraved, 2 Patton
Engraved, 2 other engraved, 2 Maydelle Incised,
2 Bullard Brushed, 1 trailed, and 2 plain.
Jones (1968:127) knew about the Henry Brown
No. 2 site, saying that it was similar to Henry
Brown No. 1 with burials containing historic materials and village areas, but he did not include
it in the Kinsloe phase because he did not have
detailed information on it; this probably means
that he had not dug any graves there, and that the

looters had not shown him what they had found.
Virtually all we know about this site is what Webb
et al. (1969:8–9) report: “a number of burials contained glass trade beads, a brass or copper disc, and
pottery vessels of types Keno Trailed, Patton Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Natchitoches Engraved,
Wilkinson Incised, Cass Appliquéd, Maydelle

The argument that these four sites could mark

KLQJHV? ÀUVW? RQ? WKHLU? DJHV?? 7KH? KLVWRULF? PDWHULDOV?
in the graves indicate clearly that they are at least
partly, and maybe wholly, more recent than most
of the archeological remains at Pine Tree Mound.
The large blue glass beads from Susie Slade and
Henry Brown No. 1 suggest occupation during the
ÀUVW?TXDUWHU?RI?WKH?A.D. 1700s (Perttula 2007:118),
shortly after the last main village occupations at
Pine Tree. This is supported by the overall scarceness of historic materials at these sites and the fact
that such artifacts are not ubiquitous, occurring in
fewer than a third of the graves where this information is known.
A second part of the argument centers on the
fact that, within the vicinities of these downstream
sites, it appears there were continuities with earlier
occupations that surely were contemporaneous
with Pine Tree. Thus, this part of the Potters Creek
valley was part of the Pine Tree Mound community
before sustained contact with Europeans. Evidence
for this comes from two sites, Resch Burial Mound
(across the creek from, and not the same as, the
Resch site) and the Old Brown Place (see Figure
10). The former (41HS14) is about 350 m north of
the Susie Slade site. It apparently contained a looted cemetery where bone preservation was negligible and where grave goods included vessels of the
types Ripley Engraved, Wilder Engraved, Hodges
Engraved, Glassell Engraved, Cass Appliqued,
Pease Brushed-Incised, Karnack Brushed-Incised,
Belcher Ridged, and Taylor Engraved, as well as
Bassett and Perdiz arrow points and celts, but no

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
historic materials (Jones 1968:124; Webb et al.
1969:7–8). Jones (1968:124) notes both similarities and differences in the vessel assemblages from
the Resch Burial Mound and Susie Slade, and he
says “as a whole, burial ware from [Resch Burial
Mound] is smaller, lacks bulbous shapes, spool

on the shared ceramic types, he suggests that Resch
Burial Mound was ancestral to Susie Slade.
The Old Brown Place (41HS260) is about
400 m west of Henry Brown No. 1. Little is known
about it, but Webb et al. (1969:8) report that three
vessels from a single burial and sherds from the
surface represent an early Titus phase occupation
predating the occupations at Henry Brown Nos. 1
and 2 (or at least the ones that produced the burials). Two of the vessels resembled Ripley and
Avery Engraved.
Finally, there are similarities between the burials at Pine Tree Mound and Susie Slade and Henry
Brown No. 1 that hint at continuities in mortuary traditions, though some of these certainly are common
to Late Caddo burials in general. These include the
following: some burials with southeastern orientations, elbow pipes and celts as offerings, comparable
numbers of vessels, pigments as offerings, clustered
arrow points and other chipped stone tools, and
graves containing multiple individuals.
These similarities notwithstanding, there are
some notable differences. Most of the documented
graves at Susie Slade and Henry Brown No. 1 were
oriented east-west, though some were northwestsoutheast like some of the graves at Pine Tree. Another difference involved the placement of ceramic
vessels in the graves. At Susie Slade and Henry
Brown No. 1, graves often had a large bottle and a

(assuming the heads were to the east or southeast).

generally near the head, and small bottles, bowls,
or jars were situated at various places.
The most glaring differences, though, are in
the vessel assemblages. While there are six ceramic types that occur in the burial assemblages
from both Pine Tree Mound and Susie Slade/
Henry Brown No. 1—Taylor Engraved, La Rue
Neck Banded, Maydelle Incised, Cass Appliqued,
Hodges Engraved, and Ripley Engraved—all but
Ripley Engraved, which is ubiquitous at Pine Tree,
are minor types. The Ripley Engraved bowls and

45

bottles and Pease Brushed-Incised jars most common at Pine Tree are rare or totally missing from
the Susie Slade and Henry Brown No. 1 graves
(acknowledging that only a fraction of the vessels recovered at Susie Slade were documented).
Replacing Ripley and Pease are Natchitoches/
Hodges Engraved bowls and bottles, Simms/Darco
Engraved bowls, and Emory Punctated jars.
The short-necked (spool-necked), bulbousbodied Natchitoches/Hodges bottles are very different than the long-necked, bell-shaped Ripley
bottles. Bowl forms too are dissimilar, with the
recurved body of Natchitoches Engraved bowls
contrasting with the angular carinations seen on the
Ripley bowls. Lacking on the Natchitoches/Hodges
bowls is the common use at Pine Tree of scalloped
and peaked rims, suggesting that the potters had
different ideas about how the bowl itself served
as a canvas for motif construction. The scroll and
swirl motifs on the Natchitoches Engraved bowls
clearly revolve around the bowl base instead of beLQJ?UHVWULFWHG?WR?WKH?VSDFH?DERYH?WKH?ÀUVW?FDULQDWLRQ?
as on Ripley bowls from Pine Tree. The distinctive
short, sharply inverted rim on a deep body characWHULVWLF?RI?6LPPV?(QJUDYHG?´KXE?FDSµ?ERZOV?DOVR?
is missing at Pine Tree, as is the small bowl form
with globular body and short everted rim decorated
with ticked panels that Jones (1968:161–163) calls
Darco Engraved. Perttula (2007:116–119) suggests
these are a local variant of Simms Engraved and
calls them variety Darco, since they were not found
at any of the other Kinsloe sites. If he is right, they

from beyond the Potters Creek valley, though the
form bears little resemblance to any of the bowl
forms at Pine Tree Mound.
In sum, the differences in vessel forms and motifs
between these two groups of ceramic types suggest
that most of the Susie Slade/Henry Brown No. 1 assemblage did not develop out of the ceramics made
at Pine Tree Mound. Their antecedents appear to lie
elsewhere. Based strictly on the types involved, the
obvious directions to look are east (Natchitoches/
Hodges and Emory) and north (Simms and Emory)
(Perttula 1992:127–128, 131, 153–154, 166). Though
these types occur widely across the Caddo area in
early historic contexts, they are most common in the
Red River valley below and above the Great Bend. Of
course, the fact that these styles of pots do occur over
such a wide area is one of the things that makes it hard
to know what to make of their prominence at Susie
Slade and Henry Brown No. 1. Caddo-made pottery

was involved in extensive trade in the A.D. 1700s
(Perttula 1992:168), but there also was much movement of people.
One way of interpreting the evidence from
the Potters Creek valley is that it does contain
the remnant resident population of the Pine Tree
Mound community, but one that was being affected in profound ways by interactions they and
other Caddo groups were having with Europeans,
starting in the late A.D. 1600s and accelerating
through the 1700s and into the 1800s. That this was
happening throughout the Caddo area is axiomatic,
but this explanation is especially apt for this part
of Harrison County because the Hasinai Trace,
and after that Trammel’s Trace, traversed it, crossing Potters Creek near the Susie Slade site (see
Figure 10). With so many changes afoot, and so
much movement of people and interaction between
groups, both Native and not, it is little wonder we
see differences in burial practices compared to the
prehistoric practices at Pine Tree Mound. Hence,
it seems likely that what is visible archeologically
in this area, in this subset of the Kinsloe phase,
is what remained of a Pine Tree Mound community that had been severely altered by decrease in
population through disease and rapid shifts of the
centers of political power as Europeans entered the
region. Other Caddo groups likely consolidated
with or subsumed what was left of this community
in the face of these changes, creating an archeological signature different than the one that preceded it.

The features and artifacts found in Areas 2N,
2S, and 8 at Pine Tree Mound leave little room to
doubt whether the structures there were residences.
There is nothing in the artifacts or the architecture,

special buildings. Rather, the structures show a
consistency of form, even with the complication
of overprinting, that suggests functional consistency as domiciles ranging from 4.8 to 8.3 m in
diameter, averaging 6.3 m (excluding the smallest
one, discussed below as a possible auxiliary structure). Groups probably ranging in size from four
to 11 individuals, with an average of seven, and
probably representing single nuclear or extended
families lived in these houses. Some houses were

built, occupied for a time, and then abandoned,
while others were substantially rebuilt up to three
times before abandonment. It is likely that rebuilding was dictated mostly by deterioration of
construction materials, especially wall posts, and
this could explain some of the variation in house
size, for example, reuse of shorter recycled posts
necessitating smaller houses. Other factors such as
changes in family size or status could have been at
play as well, but archeological evidence allowing
us to address this question is scant to nonexistent.
Architectural consistency is indicated by the
fact that central postholes that held construction
posts were found in 18 of the 38 structures. Plowing likely destroyed those in the other structures
and also is the reason no intact hearths were found
above central postholes in any of the houses. However, in one house in Area 2N and another in Area
2S, the center postholes were capped with burned
sediment interpreted as remnants of hearths, indicating that this practice probably was common.
Otherwise, a small pit, smudge pit, or series of
small pits was near many center postholes. Aside
from the occasional smudge pits, these pits showed
no evidence of burning within them, and thus they
appear not to be pit hearths. However, their positions suggest they were integral to activities commonly performed near house centers.
Other than the central pit and post features,

Area 2S house complex where overprinting was

walls. This pattern extended along the western twoWKLUGV?RI?WKH?KRXVH??ÁDQNLQJ?DQG?RSSRVLWH?WKH?HDVWHUQ?
entryway. These interior postholes may represent
benches or alcoves along the walls of the house. In
addition, a large shallow pit with an intrusive small
pit and a smudge pit were along the western wall,
opposite the entryway. These pit features suggest
that this part of the house was the focus of particular
kinds of activities, storage, or even ritual, as an infant burial was found in this position in another Area
2S house. All of these features are consistent with
historic descriptions of Caddo houses that mention
raised beds or sleeping alcoves, a central communal
hearth, and either a special-purpose or storage area
DFURVV?IURP?WKH?HQWU\ZD\? *ULIÀWK????????²??? ?
Features exterior to the houses include
postholes, smudge pits, other small pits, and
various large pits. It was impossible to determine

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
associations in most cases, but one small circular
structure in Area 2N, at 3.5 m in diameter, is a good
candidate for an auxiliary building such as a ramada
or large granary. Two concentrations of features in
Area 8 contain linear alignments of postholes that
could be rectangular structures such as ramadas
or raised platforms measuring 5.0 x 3.0 and 7.0 x
2.5 m. Most of the exterior features, though, appear
to relate to outdoor activity areas positioned around
the houses. Feature Cluster B in Area 2S may be
one of the less overprinted ones. Covering an area
of about 7.5 x 2.5 m, it contains nine possible
postholes, two possible postholes/pits, one smudge
pit, two small pits, and one large pit. The smudge
pit and both small pits are close to one another on
one side of the cluster, while the large pit is about
3.4 m away on the other side. Six of the possible
postholes, perhaps representing drying racks or
similar structures, are in the area between.
Artifact distributions make it clear that the
trash that accumulated in and around the houses
included things discarded where they were used
as well as trash transported a short distance away.
There is no indication of consistent trash disposal
away from the houses creating large middens. It
appears that most activities associated with daily
life occurred within the house compounds. The
debris includes faunal remains, macrobotanical
remains, chipped stone debitage, chipped stone
tools, ground stone tools, and ceramic sherds, all
representing domestic activities. The many ground
stone anvils and grinding slabs used in processing
vegetal materials support this conclusion, as do the
often-broken arrow points and other chipped stone
tools made mostly from local materials, which
contrasts with the high proportion of arrow points
of imported materials in the burials. The ceramic
sherds represent numerous vessels broken and discarded in and around the houses, with the domestic
assemblage having a greater proportion of jars used
in daily tasks such as cooking and storage than the
assemblage included in the graves.
The many overprinted structures and coinciding artifact distributions in Areas 2N and 8 (the
plow zone in Area 2S was not sampled well enough
to include it in the artifact distributional analysis),
each covering about 0.14 hectares, suggest that the
house compounds may have been circumscribed to
some degree. Whether this was by hedgerows as
appear on the A.D. 1691 Terán map of the Nasoni
town on the Red River or simply by surrounding

have had long-lasting effects, though, since it appears the Caddo (or somebody) returned to Area 2
in the eighteenth century to live or camp right on
top of the remains of the earlier village.
Considerable attention was given in analyzing
the excavation data to trying to determine whether
the house compounds in Areas 2 and 8 represent
use by particular families or lineages by looking at
identity, role, and status information gleaned from
the burials. Acknowledging that there is ambiguity
about which set of houses the Area 2 cemetery actually goes with and that the burials in both areas contain only a sample of the people who resided there,
that analysis indicates that the two have similar percentages of high-status graves with similar kinds of
offerings and similar average numbers of vessels per
grave—10.8 in Area 2 and 10.0 in Area 8—which
suggests that the families associated with them
were equivalent socially. From this perspective, the
house compounds look like functionally and socially
equivalent parts of an integrated community.
Differences were noted, however, between the
vessel motifs from the Areas 2 and 8 burials. These
differences are structural, i.e., in the ways elements
were combined, rather than in the use of particular
elements. The differences suggest that individual
potters controlled how meaning was expressed in
ways that conveyed family identity. For instance,
bowls decorated with scroll motifs (including all
variations of the central element) are more common
in the Area 2 graves than in Area 8. Conversely,
bowls decorated with bands of motifs are more
common in Area 8. Differences in bowl rim treatment also distinguish the two areas. While bowls
from both areas have high percentages of straight
rims, peaked rims only appear in the Area 2 graves,
and scalloped rims are relatively common in Area
8. Differences also can be seen in bottle motifs. In
the Area 2 graves, Ripley Engraved bottles have
scroll or circular motif elements that are decorated
with pendant triangles. In the Area 8 graves, bottles
with pendant triangles are present, but they decorate
concentric bands around the body. Thus, bottles
decorated with concentric circle or scroll motifs
and peaked bowls decorated with scroll motifs may
mark the family associated with the Area 2 cemetery, while bottles with bands of pendant triangles
and bowls decorated with a band of elements and a
scalloped rim would more likely represent the Area
8 family. Of course, burials in both Areas 2 and 8
also have vessel offerings with motifs common to
the other, implying a level of integration that is not

occupation of the village, at least by part of the
community. Maygrass, Chenopodium, little barley,
and erect knotweed seeds were recovered as well,
indicating use of these starchy-seeded annuals.
Most of the other plant remains representing
foods (or in some cases perhaps medicines) are
hardwood nuts, especially hickory but also acorn,
black walnut, and pecan. Sumac fruits, waterlily
or pondlily buds, American lotus seeds, Virginia
creeper or grape fruits, persimmon seeds, blackberry seeds, verbena nutlets, and bulbs that could be
from plants such as wild garlic or camas apparently
also were consumed or used, though these remains
are few. The sumac remains are important because

based on agricultural products supplemented by
wild foods obtained from the site and its environs.
The faunal remains indicate that white-tailed
deer supplied the bulk of the animal protein, with
primarily terrestrial turtles, rabbits, and squirrels
contributing most of the balance. Fish, mussels,
and birds apparently were not large parts of the diet.
Deer is especially predominant compared to many
other Caddo sites. This probably is due to differences in site setting more than any other factor.

too late to relate to the Caddo occupation (at one
sigma). All four of these also have earlier intervals,
however, that could go with the late dates from Pine

1363–1385 (and two-sigma intervals of 1263–1325
and 1344–1394) and could relate to the early end of
the Pine Tree sequence, although this is at odds with
the reported recovery of a Natchitoches Engraved
vessel. Of course, it is possible the site was occupied at various times, with a comparatively strong
earlier Caddo occupation supported by the moderate
percentage of brushing.
7KH?&HUHPRQLDO?3UHFLQFW
The place to start talking about the layout of the
Pine Tree Mound community is what we have called
WKH?FRUH?DUHD??DQG?PRUH?VSHFLÀFDOO\?D?VXEVHW?RI?WKDW?
area that was the focus of ceremonial activities. This
ceremonial precinct, which was the center of the
higher-level religious and political activities for the
entire community, extends about 300 m north-south
and 230 m east-west, encompassing some 5.7 hectares (Figure 11). At its heart, and covering most of
its area, was the plaza. Though this feature may not
be as empty as the lack of features, and near-absence
of artifacts, in the 15 trenches dug there imply, it
does not appear to have contained any substantial
buildings. Pauketat (2007:90–95) and others have
noted that “central plazas, not the surrounding

the case at Pine Tree. Certainly, the construction

happened early in the history of the site, and an argument can be made that construction of Mound A

drainage that separates 41HS15 from 41HS573 and
part of 41HS574, and at its northwest corner is one
or more burial plots, or perhaps more likely a large
cemetery. A few postholes and possible postholes
suggest that some of these graves were marked by
aboveground poles. This cemetery could contain
hundreds of graves, some for high-status members of the community. The radiocarbon evidence
indicates that use of this cemetery began early in
the history of the ceremonial precinct, if not at the
beginning.
Over time, in the A.D. 1400s and 1500s, other
ceremonial buildings and probably houses for important people were constructed around the edges of the
plaza. Minimally, this happened just east of Mound A,
about 50 m north of Mound C, and most dramatically
on the southwest side of the plaza. Here, Mound B
was created in several stages through the construction
and destruction of a sequence of important buildings;
a special building with multiple superimposed burned

at least two structures, one being a circular one about
the size of the houses in Areas 2 and 8 and the other
possibly a low small mound, a maze-like building,
or even a built-up surface with posts jutting from it,
were built between Mounds A and B. The end result
was a ceremonial precinct with space for gathered
crowds in the middle bounded by tumuli supporting special buildings around its southern sides and a
cemetery for important people on its north side. Other
buildings with ritual functions and probably houses
for people critical to these functions were present
at various times and in various places between and
around the mounds.
Of course, it is likely that the layout of some
components of this part of the site was guided by
things associated with the cosmology of the people
who worshipped here. Analysis of the burials at the
site concluded that the positions of the sunrise and
the stars Antares and Sirius were important to the

however, since one (Area 3) turned out to more likely
be a non-domiciliary activity area, and another (Area
2) actually contains two residential areas.
So, with the advantage of hindsight, how
many residential areas might there actually be?

Our guess is at least 15 (Figure 12). This includes
the following: the three in Areas 2N, 2S, and 8;
one just northeast of Area 2N, as suggested by
artifact distributions there; two in Area 5, judging from the size of the landform and extent of

52

the trenches with archeological materials; three
in Area 6, judging from the size of the landform,
extent of the trenches with archeological materials,
and the fact that this area likely extended farther
north than suggested by testing before a modern
house was built there; one in Area 7, based on its
small size; two at 41HS573, based on the extent
of trenches with possible cultural features; two
at 41HS574, with one on the east side of the
tributary cutting through the site based on the pit
there and looted graves nearby and one west of
the tributary adjacent to 41HS15; and one at the
untested southeast edge of the core area, just west
of 41HS574, where many artifacts were found in
disturbed areas around a barn and livestock pens.
This excludes three areas considered possible
villages in 2004: (1) Area 1, because no cultural
features were found there, and its proximity to the
ceremonial precinct suggests the midden deposits
there more likely relate to things that happened in
that precinct; (2) Area 3, probably a locus of nondomiciliary activities; and (3) Area 4, because no
cultural features were found there, and it consists
of a small (25 m in diameter) natural rise surrounded by low marshy terrain that seems better
suited to non-domiciliary activities.
These 15 residential areas are as close to the
ceremonial precinct as 100 m and as far away as
370 m. The closest ones, at 100–150 m, are in
Areas 5 and 6 to the southwest and south, along
with the ones at the southeast edge of the core
area and in the west part of 41HS574. Somewhat
farther away, at about 250 m, are 41HS573 and
the east part of 41HS574. The ones in Areas 2, 7,
and 8 and just northeast of Area 2 are most distant
at 300–370 m. This variability in distance appears
to be a function of where places on the landscape
best suited for residential occupation were (e.g.,
elevated spots), as opposed to some sort of planned
layout consisting of concentric bands of villages
arrayed around the ceremonial area. This is not
to say, however, that there might not be differences between the village areas that correlate with
distance (status, for example). Because all of the
excavated ones are in the group farthest from the
mounds, we do not have the capacity to look at this
question, though.
While there is some chance that the true
number of residential areas is fewer than 15 (e.g.,
maybe Areas 5 and 6 and 41HS573 and 41HS574
have only single ones), there is a greater likelihood
that the actual number is higher. There are two

main reasons to think this. First, the 2004 trenching
was neither systematic nor very intensive. Thus,
there are parts of the site where no trenching at
all was done. The Area 2S village, which was not
discovered until the 2006 excavations, illustrates
the consequences of this.
Second, the ca. 1-m-wide trenches used in
testing and the initial stage of data recovery probDEO\?DUH?EHWWHU?DW?ÀQGLQJ?IHDWXUHV?ZKHQ?WKHUH?DUH?
lots of them than when there are few. Hence, they
are more effective at locating villages that were
used for a long time and thus heavily overprinted
than ones with short use histories, such as single
houses that were not rebuilt. The fact that two of
the areas excavated in 2006–2007 are of the former sort supports this conclusion. This opens up
the possibility that there could be any number of
less-intensively used residential areas that escaped
detection in 2004.
So, what did these minimum 15 residential
areas look like? Based on what we found in Areas
2N, 2S, and 8, it seems that, more often than not,
each consisted of a single circular pole-and-thatch
house averaging 6.3 m in diameter. Two houses
may have stood simultaneously in some areas at
certain times, but this appears to have been the
exception rather than the rule. Auxiliary structures
such as ramadas and granaries probably were presHQW?DV?ZHOO??WKRXJK?WKHVH?DUH?QRW?ZHOO?GHÀQHG?LQ?
the Pine Tree Mound site data set. Outside activity
areas relating to various mundane activities also
are indicated, and these likely were associated
with less-substantial structures such as drying
racks and wind screens. The evidence from the
excavated ones suggests that most residential areas were not occupied continuously. A house was
built and then rebuilt once, twice, or three times,
spanning perhaps no more than 40 years, and
then that area was abandoned for a period of time
before being reoccupied again and a new house
built. These can be seen as multi-generational
house compounds, just not ones that had a simple
use history of genesis followed by continuous use
and then abandonment. What spurred the ebb and
ÁRZ?RI?RFFXSDWLRQ?LV?XQNQRZQ??DOWKRXJK?LW?FRXOG?
relate to events such as the death of a lineage head,
for example. As noted above, there may well be
other kinds of residential areas that were occupied
for single generations or less, though we have no
concrete evidence of this.
From this characterization, it is fair to say that
calling these village areas, as we did commonly

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
during the project, is misleading. Single houses
do not make villages. Multiple houses do, and it is
the aggregate of the residential areas in use at any
one time that made up the Pine Tree Mound village. Trading the likelihood that not all residential
areas were occupied at the same time off against
the possibility of some undiscovered and unimagined ones, maybe mostly single-house ones
but perhaps one or two with more-complicated
histories, it probably is reasonable to suggest that,
at its height, the nucleus of this village consisted
of about 15 houses and their auxiliary structures
situated strategically around the ceremonial precinct, which had its complement of ceremonial
buildings and houses for elite group members.
Assuming three houses in the ceremonial precinct, and using the average family size of seven
individuals proposed for Areas 2 and 8, it appears
likely that about 125 people lived in this village.
In general, this village looks much like what Terán
mapped at the Nasoni Caddo village on the Red
River in A.D. 1691.

Aside from the house compounds and ceremonial precinct, other landscape components that
contributed to the character of the site included
QRQ?UHVLGHQWLDO? DFWLYLW\? DUHDV?? FXOWLYDWHG? ÀHOGV??
cemeteries at some distance from residential areas,
freshwater springs and drainages, borrow areas
where the more than 5,000 m3? RI? ÀOO? XVHG? IRU?
mound construction was obtained, and pathways
or lines of sight.
There are three known concentrations of cultural materials outside the ceremonial precinct that
are interpreted as something other than residential
areas (see Figure 12). Area 3 is the only one we
know much about. With just 11 cultural features
(two probable postholes, one possible posthole, one
possible posthole/pit, three small pits, three large
pits, and one burned rock concentration) found
there in testing and data recovery, it appears not
to contain any houses. While it likely represents a
large activity area, there is little indication in the
artifacts that those activities were much different
than those performed in the residential areas. The
only notable exception is the relatively frequent occurrence of ground stone anvils and grinding slabs,
suggesting an emphasis on plant food processing
(30 percent of those found during data recovery are

53

from Area 3). One possibility raised by the two late
radiocarbon dates is that the Caddo used this part of
the ridge top, immediately overlooking the Potters
&UHHN? YDOOH\? WR? WKH? ZHVW?? ÀUVW? IRU? JURZLQJ? FURSV?
and only later for artifact-producing activities.
The other two possible nonresidential locales—Areas 1 and 4—are known only from
testing data. Their interpretations are based on the
fact that no features were found there (other than
a midden in one), the location of Area 1 adjacent
to the ceremonial precinct, and the small size of
Area 4. There is nothing in the artifacts collected
that makes these areas look different, though, and
interpreting them as non-residential is speculative.

the presence of sumac wood and seeds in village

are extensive both north and south of the site and
also occupy upland areas to the east across Starkey
Creek and west across Potters Creek. About 41 percent of the 706 hectares within 1.5 km of the center
of the site, or 289 hectares, is considered prime
farmland by modern standards. Clearly, the Pine
Tree Mound Caddo had ample room to raise crops.
The presence of family cemeteries removed
from residential areas is suggested by the one
found in Area 2. We are not certain which village
area those graves go with, but there is an argument

54

Texas Archeological Society

that they are associated with some of the houses
in Area 2N about 60 m away. This contrasts with
the situation in Area 8 where all of the graves
were close to the houses and thus within or very
near the compound. Such cemeteries could have
been marked by poles or other visible elements, as
was suggested for the cemetery in the ceremonial
precinct (no postholes were recorded in the Area 2
cemetery, but only obvious ones would have been
found in the rapid stripping done in this area).
Seven freshwater springs were on and adjacent to the site as of 2004, and, though direct
archeological evidence is lacking, these probably
were the main sources of water when the site was
occupied (see Figure 12). The spring at the head
of the dammed drainage on the west edge of the
ceremonial precinct was still productive enough to
water cattle in 2004. If these sources, and perhaps
others undiscovered in the drainages on the site,
GLG?QRW?ÀOO?WKH?UHVLGHQWV·?ZDWHU?QHHGV??3RWWHUV?DQG?
Starkey Creeks were short walks away. Presently, at
their nearest points Starkey Creek is 460 m east of
Mound A and Potters Creek is 300 m west of Area 3.
The springs also likely had cosmological sigQLÀFDQFH?DV?SRUWDOV?WR?WKH?XQGHUZRUOG??7KH?XQGHUworld, or lower realm, of the multi-level cosmos

considered a watery world below the earth-disk that
was ruled by the Great Serpent or Horned Serpent
(Lankford 2007:108–109). It probably is no coincidence that Mounds A and B are close to springs, with
the springs linking the mounds to that watery realm.
The Great Serpent also had a celestial manifestation
that has been linked to the asterism Antares/Scorpio
(Lankford 2007:128–129). The southeastern orientation of Mound A relative to Mound B and the highstatus cemetery and the similar head placement of
the deceased in the Pine Tree Mound site graves may
have been an acknowledgment of that manifestation,

from the surface; this may even by why this area
is marshy today. Fill for mound building also could
have been brought in from off site, for example, the
steep slopes leading down to Potters Creek.

pathways, left no archeological signatures that
we detected. They surely were present, though.
Further, it is likely that clear lines of sight were
maintained between the family compounds and the
ceremonial precinct, preserving visual communication with the village center. Given the number of
residential areas, as well as the likelihood of culWLYDWHG?ÀHOGV?VXUURXQGLQJ?WKHP??WKH?VLWH?SUREDEO\?

drainages east of Area 8, the south and southwest
sides of the ceremonial precinct, and the north side
of the ceremonial precinct.
One landscape feature that appears not to
have been characteristic of this village were consistently used trash dumps outside of residential
areas. It appears that trash disposal occurred most
often near houses, with that debris becoming
mixed with materials discarded where they were
used and broken. It is possible, of course, that a
somewhat different conclusion might be reached
if the drainage through the middle of the site was
not inundated, but even if trash disposal did occur
there, it seems unlikely that it would have been for
the whole village.
7KH?/DUJHU?3LQH?7UHH?0RXQG?&RPPXQLW\
Moving beyond the immediate vicinity of Pine
Tree Mound, it is possible to identify other places
where Caddo people who probably were members
of the community lived. With few other sites excavated, the quantity and quality of the data do
not match that from Pine Tree, but we do have one

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
distinct advantage in that surveys for the Sabine
Mine have covered some 15,800 hectares in the
vicinity, including substantial parts of the Potters
and Starkey Creek valleys and those of six other
Sabine River tributaries—Spring Creek, Brandy
Branch, Hatley Creek, Hardin Creek, Rodgers
Creek, and Clarks Creek—to the west. Coverage
to the east is less, although much of the uplands
between the valleys of Potters and Starkey Creeks
east to Colliers Creek, a tributary of Eightmile
Creek, has been examined.
Of the 613 archeological sites documented
at the Sabine Mine and adjacent Darco Mine,
most in systematic surveys done since 1976, 397
have Native American components (not counting
41HS15, 41HS573, and 41HS574, which make up
the nucleus of the Pine Tree Mound community).
Most of these are lithic scatters about which we
know very little. Some lithic scatters could be
associated with Pine Tree as limited-use campsites or procurement or processing locations, but
almost always there is no way to know since they
typically do not have diagnostic artifacts or datable materials. It is easier to say something about
most of the 95 sites that contain pottery and one
site with a Caddo-age arrow point but no pottery,
since they give us at least some chance of assessing their ages and thus potential associations. Even
these are not without problems, though. Just one
has seen data recovery excavations by professional
archeologists (41HS74), and 34 others have seen
varying amounts of test excavations. One site
(Resch, 41HS16) was excavated by avocational
archeologists and is well reported. Eight others—
Susie Slade (41HS13); Resch Burial Mound
(41HS14); 41HS144; 41HS191; Old Brown Place
(41HS260); Henry Brown Nos. 1 and 2 (41HS261
and 41HS262); and 41HS770—are known mostly
from accounts by looters and are not reported
well. That leaves 52 sites for which we have only
survey-level information, and for many that inforPDWLRQ?LV?OLPLWHG?WR?D?KDQGIXO?RI?VKHUGV?DQG?ÁDNHV?
However, the data that do exist can be used to
take a stab at identifying sites that were associated
with Pine Tree Mound, providing insights into the
extent of the community. For a small number of
sites, this can be done using radiocarbon dates or
sizeable and well-reported samples of diagnostic
artifacts, especially sherds. For most, though, it
hinges on one simple factor, whether a site contains brushed pottery. We recognize this does not
constitute proof, since multiple Caddo groups over

55

a wide area used pots with brushed surfaces over
a long time period. But given the prominence of
brushing in the Pine Tree Mound assemblage, the
fact that the site spans all of the Late Caddo period
and parts of the Middle Caddo and Historic Caddo
ones as well, and the fact that brushed pottery does
not occur much in contexts clearly predating the
A.D. 1300s in this area (e.g., at the Hudnall-Pirtle
site), the presence of brushing at sites in the immediate vicinity seems like a reasonable indicator
that they were occupied at the same time Pine Tree
Mound was.
Forty of the 95 sites with pottery (once again,
excluding 41HS15, 41HS573, and 41HS574) have
brushed sherds and thus probably are associated
in some way with Pine Tree (Table 2). The single
site with an arrow point but no pottery is not associated, since that artifact is an Early Caddo Catahoula point. For 81 sites, determinations could
be made based on data in reports or on site forms.
7KLV?DVVXPHV?WKDW?EUXVKHG?VKHUGV?ZHUH?LGHQWLÀHG?
correctly in those analyses, which probably is safe
given that brushing is usually obvious. For the
UHPDLQLQJ????VLWHV??ZH?WULHG?WR?ÀQG?FROOHFWLRQV?DW?
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory we
could examine but were successful in only four
cases. This leaves 10 sites (41HS57, 41HS61,
41HS62, 41HS117, 41HS118, 41HS129, 41HS138,
41HS184, 41HS230, and 41HS282) that are supposed to contain ceramics but for which we are
unable to determine possible associations with
Pine Tree. If the proportions among the 85 sites for

be Late Caddo.
What is most striking about the 40 sites that
could be associated with Pine Tree Mound is their
distribution relative to the 347 sites that are unlikely to be associated (excluding the 10 sites that
cannot be evaluated; Figure 13). They are heavily
concentrated in the Potters Creek valley (63 percent), with much smaller numbers on Spring Creek
(5 percent), Hatley Creek (10 percent), Hardin
Creek (3 percent), and Clarks Creek (10 percent)
to the west; the remaining four sites (10 percent)
RYHUORRN? WKH? 6DELQH? 5LYHU? ÁRRGSODLQ?? 7KH? VLWHV?
that are not associated have a much more equitable
distribution across the drainages. This suggests
that the principal Pine Tree Mound community
village extended for a distance of about 5.5 km
along Potters Creek, with the ceremonial precinct
at its northern upstream end, mirroring what Terán
mapped at the Hatchel site on the Red River in

A.D. 1691 (as Perttula [personal communication
2011] notes, however, that map was a snapshot in
time; if you look at the Hatchel site in its totality,
the large mound there was in the middle of the
village, not on the edge). Though part of the Potters Creek valley above Pine Tree Mound has not

has been examined to indicate that associated sites
there are scattered rather than clustered as they are
downstream. The associated sites outside the Potters Creek valley probably can be viewed best as
outlying members of the community.
For many of these sites, we do not have enough
information to know just how they are associated
with the community, for example, as residential
hamlets or procurement/processing locations, or
even if the Late Caddo occupation was the major one at that location. From the better known
ones, though, it is clear that there is variability
among them. At one end of the spectrum is the
Lane Mitchell site (41HS4/233), discussed earlier,
which overlooks lower Hatley Creek just north of

of plain to decorated sherds [PDR = 0.6]) clearly

mounds it must represent another nexus of ceremonial activities for the community, but too little is
known about the site to say much more.
At the other end of the spectrum are sites
where brushed sherds are infrequent (4–29 percent)
and plain sherds outnumber decorated ones by far
(PDR = 3.3–11.1). Among these are the Resch site
??+6?? ?RQ?3RWWHUV?&UHHN??ZKLFK?KDV?VLJQLÀFDQW?
Archaic and Woodland components (Webb et al.
1969:96–99); 41HS231 overlooking Hatley Creek
DQG? WKH? 6DELQH? 5LYHU? ÁRRGSODLQ?? ZKHUH?$UFKDLF??
Woodland, and Early to Middle Caddo materials
are relatively abundant (Dockall et al. 2008:57–
96); and 41HS488 and the Gray’s Pasture site
(41HS524) on Clarks Creek and 41HS74 on Hatley
Creek, where most of the remains are from Archaic
and Early to Middle Caddo occupations (HeartÀHOG?? 3ULFH? DQG? *UHHQH?? ,QF??? ????????? WKURXJK?
7-20; Keller 1993:43–45, 70–72; Keller and Speir
n.d.; Perttula 2000). The small numbers of brushed
sherds, and in some cases Late Caddo arrow points,
at these sites probably indicate they were used in a
non-intensive fashion, perhaps as short-term campsites during procurement or processing forays, by
members of the Pine Tree Mound community.
Other sites likely to be associated with Pine

Tree, and for which more than minimal information
LV?DYDLODEOH??EUHDN?GRZQ?LQWR?WKUHH?JURXSV??7KH?ÀUVW?
consists of the four sites downstream on Potters
Creek with Historic Caddo graves discussed earlier: Susie Slade (41HS13), Henry Brown Nos. 1 and
2 (41HS261 and 41HS262), and 41HS770. Though
some of the graves at these sites clearly postdate
the main period of occupation at Pine Tree, others
may not, given that two-thirds or more of those
at Susie Slade and Henry Brown No. 1 lacked
historic materials (information is not available for
the other two sites). Coupled with some overlap in
the pottery types represented at these sites and Pine
Tree Mound, this suggests that some parts of these
cemeteries could be earlier than others and perhaps
contemporaneous with Pine Tree. It is just as likely
that parts of the essentially unknown residential
areas that go with these cemeteries were occupied
at the same time as Pine Tree.
The second group consists of four sites with
strong evidence that their primary components
were associated with villages or smaller residential
areas contemporaneous with Pine Tree. Two of
these are the Resch Burial Mound (41HS14) and
Old Brown Place (41HS260) downstream on Potters Creek discussed earlier. Information on them
is limited, but there is little doubt of their function
and associations. The other two are 41HS588 and
41HS718, both of which have high percentages of
brushing (67–78 percent) and low ratios of plain
to decorated sherds (0.2–1.0). The former was
tested extensively and found to be a Late Caddo
residential site with one or more houses and other
features, including at least one burial, and artifacts
and radiocarbon dates demonstrating contemporaneity with Pine Tree Mound; it is on the north wall
of the Sabine River valley just downstream from
Hatley Creek, near the Lane Mitchell site (Dockall

from limited testing done there and analysis of six
vessels from a single grave destroyed by construction of a well pad (Gadus et al. 2006:76–91). Given
the similarities between those vessels and some
from graves at Pine Tree, as well as its location
on the ridge between Potters and Starkey Creeks
600 m south of Pine Tree, 41HS718 probably is
equivalent to Areas 2 and 8, i.e., a component of
the Pine Tree Mound village, but a more-distant

5LYHU? ÁRRGSODLQ? MXVW? ZHVW? RI? &ODUNV? &UHHN?? PD\?
belong with this group as well. The archeologists
who recorded it noted that looters were uncovering

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
the last of an unknown number of structures and
had excavated 17 graves oriented generally southeast-northwest. The grave orientation, the fact
that Pease Brushed-Incised is well represented in
the numerous sherds collected from the surface
(77 percent of the decorated sherds are brushed),
and the low ratio of plain to decorated sherds (0.4)
suggest that this site is a small village connected
to Pine Tree Mound; the presence of a few sherds
typed as Handy Engraved, Haley Engraved, and
Haley Complicated Incised indicates that a minor
earlier component is present as well.
The third group consists of four sites where
brushed pottery is common enough to suggest that
Late Caddo components representing something
more than ephemeral use are present, but the evidence that they are villages or residential areas may
not be as strong as at 41HS14, 41HS260, 41HS588,
and 41HS718, since few or no features were found
there. One of these (41HS846) is on the west side
of Starkey Creek just 500 m south of Pine Tree
Mound, and two others (41HS843 and 41HS844)
are immediately across Starkey Creek to the east.
Site 41HS846 has a substantial Archaic component
and an Early Caddo one, but other artifacts and
two radiocarbon dates from a midden indicate occupation contemporaneous with at least the early
end of the Pine Tree occupation as well (Gadus
et al. 2006:109–128). Site 41HS843 is limited to
D? VPDOO? ÁRRGSODLQ? ULVH?? ZKLFK?? FRXSOHG? ZLWK? WKH?
low density of ceramics, supports the conclusion
it is not residential (Gadus et al. 2006:91–99). Site
41HS844 nearby is slightly higher than 41HS843,
which along with the ceramics, a Bassett arrow
point, and three possible middens makes it more
likely that it supported residences (Gadus et al.
2006:99–109). The recovery of a few Simms Engraved sherds suggests it could even have a Historic Caddo component, though most of the pottery
looks Late Caddo. The fourth site in this group is
41HS489 on Clarks Creek at the west end of the
study area (Keller 1993:72–75); not much is known
about it, other than it contains prominent Archaic
and Late Caddo components.
The better-known of the 40 sites at the Sabine
Mine that appear to be associated with Pine Tree
Mound indicate that this part of the community
consisted of two centers of ceremonial activities,
one major and one minor; a large village nucleus
composed of at least 15 household compounds
immediately around the main ceremonial center;
at least 25 other residential areas and probably

61

short-term campsites on Starkey and Potters creeks
nearby, mostly in a 5.5-km stretch downstream; and
at least 15 other sites, probably a mix of short-term
campsites and more-intensively occupied residential locales, scattered along other Sabine River
tributaries to the west and the adjacent upland
PDUJLQV?RYHUORRNLQJ?WKH?6DELQH?ÁRRGSODLQ??:H?FDQ?
only speculate about how many people lived in this
community. Based on the estimate of 125 people
for the nucleus and dividing the number of associated sites by the hypothesized number of residential
areas at 41HS15, 41HS573, and 41HS574, though,
suggests a population at any one time of perhaps
400 people in the surveyed areas at the mine. Of
course, we will never know how good this estimate
really is given the vagaries of survey coverage, the
FHUWDLQW\?RI?XQLGHQWLÀHG?VLWHV??DQG?WKH?XQFHUWDLQWLHV?
about site function. Regardless, we think this is the
core part of the Nondacao province that Moscoso
traveled through in A.D. 1542. It would be naïve
WR?WKLQN?WKDW?WKLV?FDSWXUHV?DOO?ZKR?ZHUH?DIÀOLDWHG?
with the community, however. There is no reason to
assume that Caddo people living farther to the east,
south, west, and maybe north were not connected
to Pine Tree as well.
Lacking large numbers of excavated sites, it
is hard to know how far the territory associated
with the Pine Tree Mound community extended,
but it is possible to make some educated guesses
(Figure 14). To the north, it likely went no farther
than the divide between the Sabine River and Cypress Creek basins. The latter, and particularly Big
Cypress Creek, is the heartland of the contemporaneous Titus phase. As discussed below, there are
enough differences between Pine Tree Mound and
the Titus sites to indicate they represent distinct,
though related, groups.
To the south, between the Sabine River and
the upper parts of the Neches basin, sites with Late
Caddo components are present but not frequent.
7KHUH?DUH?QR?FRQÀUPHG?PRXQG?VLWHV??DQG?3HUWWXOD?
(2004b:40) suggests that the Caddo abandoned
much of the middle and upper Sabine River basin
in the A.D. 1400s and did not reoccupy it in a substantial way till the mid-1700s. The results of recent survey and testing efforts in the Sabine Mine’s
Rusk Permit immediately south of the Sabine River
suggest that abandonment may be too strong a

of them yielded radiocarbon dates and ceramics
attributable to the types Killough Pinched, Pease
Brushed-Incised, Maydelle Incised, and perhaps
Ripley Engraved and Simms Engraved that point to
occupation during the late part of the Caddo period.
These sites also contain earlier Caddo artifacts,
though, and they may represent a series of small
residential sites and short-term trailside campsites
dating to various parts of the Caddo tradition
rather than a single large Caddo village (Dockall
and Fields 2011:82; Dockall et al. 2010:229). The
late materials there do indicate some use that was

contemporaneous with, and almost certainly connected to, the main occupation at Pine Tree Mound.
Investigations nearby at the Oak Hill and Martin Lake Mines in Rusk and Panola counties have
LGHQWLÀHG? RWKHU? VLWHV? WKDW? DOVR? KDYH? /DWH? &DGGR?
materials. One of these is the Oak Hill Village site
on Mill Creek discussed earlier; though the predominant component there is Middle Caddo, the
ceramics, arrow points, and radiocarbon dates all
indicate some use after A.D. 1400, contemporaneous with the early occupations at Pine Tree Mound
(Rogers and Perttula 2004:96). Other sites in this

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
group include 41RK19 and 41RK21 on Martin
Creek; the materials recovered were not thoroughly
analyzed or reported, but both sites yielded numerous brushed sherds implying that later Caddo
components are present (Clark and Ivey 1974). In
short, this part of the Sabine basin, extending probably to the drainage divide, appears to have been
VSDUVHO\?VHWWOHG?E\?SHRSOH?DIÀOLDWHG?ZLWK?WKH?3LQH?
Tree Mound Caddo.
Deciding where to draw the boundary line moving east and west on the south side of the Sabine
is tricky, but placing it beyond Mill and Tiawichi
creeks on the west and Irons Bayou, the next drainage beyond Martin Creek, on the south, makes it line
up well with the boundaries suggested below for the
north side of the river. Doing this places two more
Kinsloe phase sites, Cherokee Lake (41RK132) and
Millsey Williamson (41RK3), within the extent of
the Pine Tree Mound community. Cherokee Lake,
in the Mill/Tiawichi Creek valley downstream from
Oak Hill Village, contained a moderate amount
of village debris in addition to the single historic
grave, which was oriented east-west and contained
vessels typed as Simms Engraved and Maydelle
Incised along with an elbow pipe, a Fresno arrow
point, and glass beads (Jones 1968:51–56). Among
the village debris were sherds that Jones felt were
Early Caddo but also brushed pottery, including one
sherd typeable as Pease Brushed-Incised. Hence,
it also had a Middle or Late Caddo component. At
Millsey Williamson on Martin Creek, it is hard to
tell if a component contemporaneous with the main
period of occupation at Pine Tree was represented,
as the site had been almost completely looted by
the time Jones saw it. However, most of what he
documented, including historic materials in almost
every grave, thousands of trade beads, gun parts,
JXQÁLQWV?? LURQ? NQLYHV? DQG? DUURZ? SRLQWV?? VHYHUDO?
brass objects, and Native-made ceramics, is solidly
historic (Jones 1968:67–84). The results of recent
analysis of a small collection of ceramics and glass
beads from the site is consistent with this, suggesting a date range of A.D. 1740–1790 (Perttula and
Nelson 2007).
Moving west from Pine Tree Mound on
the north side of the river, clues about a boundary come from a series of looted cemeteries on
Hawkins Creek in Gregg County, northwest of
Longview (41GG50, 41GG51, and 41GG53–
41GG56). Though little is known of them, the site
records indicate they contained about 100 graves
oriented east-west, with offerings including Ripley

63

Engraved bowls with the pendant triangles motif,
Wilder and Taylor Engraved bottles, brushed jars,
Bassett and Maud arrow points, and a pair of ear
spools, among other things. Perttula (2005b:358,
371–376) considers these to be associated with the
Titus phase, and the apparent prominence of the
pendant triangles motif, Taylor Engraved bottles,
and Maud points does stand in contrast to what was
found at Pine Tree. Based on this, it appears the
western boundary of the Pine Tree Mound community north of the Sabine may have been somewhere
east of Hawkins Creek and west of Clarks Creek.
East of Pine Tree Mound, there is so little
archeological information that it is hard to use it
as a basis for addressing this issue. The only area
that has seen much attention is along the lower porWLRQ?RI?(LJKWPLOH?&UHHN?MXVW?DERYH?LWV?FRQÁXHQFH?
with the Sabine River. A recent survey examined
about 2,100 acres here and documented a handful
of Native American sites, including C. D. Marsh
(41HS269), another of the Kinsloe phase sites.
The single historic grave at the Marsh site is quite
similar to those at Susie Slade and Henry Brown
No. 1 much closer to Pine Tree, with an eastwest orientation and containing vessels typed as
Natchitoches Engraved, Emory Punctated, Simms
Engraved, and La Rue Neck Banded, along with
a plain vessel, a large biface, and two silver disks
(Jones 1968:88–93). More important, though, is the
fact that the site contains abundant earlier Caddo
remains. Jones excavated seven other burials, all
prehistoric and apparently oriented north-south,
in another part of the site, and he collected or observed much village debris, the bulk of which he
felt went with the prehistoric occupations. Though
he concluded that much of the prehistoric material
related to Haley and Bossier phase occupations, the
VKHUGV?KH?LGHQWLÀHG?DV?3HDVH?%UXVKHG?,QFLVHG?DQG?
the two arrow points he typed as Bassett suggest
some similarities to the materials from Pine Tree
Mound (Jones 1968:85, 96). Contemporaneity
also is implied by the high percentage of brushing
(64 percent) and low ratio of plain to decorated
sherds (0.5) among the small collection (n = 64)
made in shovel testing at C. D. Marsh in 2010
*ULIÀWK?HW?DO?????? ??*LYHQ?WKLV?DQG?WKH?IDFW?WKDW?
Eightmile Creek is the next drainage east of Potters
Creek, it is likely that 41HS269 is at least partly
associated with the Pine Tree Mound community.
East beyond Eightmile Creek and its upper
tributary Quapaw Creek is the divide between
the Sabine and Red River basins, and this is a

64

Texas Archeological Society

logical place for the boundary of the Pine Tree
Mound community. There is no way to know if
this boundary should follow the Eightmile Creek
valley closely as it moves south toward the Sabine
or encompass the next two drainages to the east,
Caddo and Jackson Creeks. Figure 14 depicts the
latter, though, based on the fact that it is a long
distance down river to the next large north-side
tributary, Socagee Creek. Drawing the line this
way pulls 41PN1 on the river between Caddo and
-DFNVRQ?FUHHNV?ZLWKLQ?WKH?ERXQGDU\??7KLV?LV?VLJQLÀcant because 41PN1 may contain a mound. All that
is known about it, though, is that A. M. Woolsey
observed a tumulus of dirt about 20 m in diameter
DQG?????P?KLJK?RQ?WKH?ÁRRGSODLQ?KHUH?LQ???????,WV?
setting is more similar to that of Hudnall-Pirtle
upstream than Pine Tree or Lane Mitchell, and
thus if it is a mound it may be Early Caddo rather
than Late Caddo.
This exercise suggests that the larger Pine
Tree Mound community, equating to the Nondacao province and the home territory of the Nadaco
Caddo, extended across an area roughly 50 km
north-south by 60 km east-west, encompassing
some 2,400 km2 with the Sabine River running
through the middle. People were not distributed
evenly throughout this area, though. The main village was north of the river, stretching for 5.5 km
along the Potters Creek valley and anchored by the
Pine Tree Mound site at its north end. The rest of
the community appears to have been more rural,
though at two different scales. Other north-side
tributary valleys, extending from maybe Mason
Creek on the west to Eightmile, Caddo, or Jackson
Creek on the east, may have supported moderately
scattered settlements. The entire territory south of
the river, accounting for well over half of it, appears to have been sparsely settled.
This largely hypothetical reconstruction is similar to Story and Creel’s (1982) model of sociopolitical organization and settlement patterning for the
Frankston and Allen phases of the Neches-Angelina
River basin, which grew out of study of the Deshazo
site and built on earlier work by Wyckoff and Baugh
(1980) and others. Their model posits a single major

suggest that the A. C. Saunders site in Anderson
&RXQW\??FRQWDLQLQJ?D?PRXQG?ZLWK?PXFK?DVK?ÀOO?DQG?D?
large structure nearby, could be such a center (Story

and Creel 1982:32). Positioned around this center
would be multiple scattered supporting “constituent
JURXSV?µ?HDFK?FRQWDLQLQJ?D?OHVVHU?FHUHPRQLDO?FHQWHU?
and potentially an array of residential sites ranging
from single-house farmsteads to small villages, as
well as short-term use sites. The lesser centers likely
would be the residence-ritual complexes of local
leaders, i.e., caddis, consisting of several buildings
and an associated plaza but no mounds, and they
hypothesize that Deshazo could be one of these
(Story and Creel 1982:32). They suggest that the
DUFKHRORJLFDO?HYLGHQFH?RI?WKH?DIÀOLDWHG?JURXS?WKDW?
was the subject of their study should be called the
´$QGHUVRQ?&OXVWHU?µ
The evidence from the Pine Tree Mound community that is most consistent with this model
is the Pine Tree Mound site itself, which certainly is the paramount ceremonial center, and
the distribution and variety of associated sites;
together, they make this community look like an
affiliated group. What is not readily apparent are
constituent groups. While it would be possible to
look at Figure 13 and suggest that some clusters
of sites represent constituent groups, we know
too little about most of these sites to begin to
address that question, and the problem becomes
even more acute moving away from Potters Creek
and adjacent valleys into areas where much less
archeological work has been done. There is some
logic to interpreting the Lane Mitchell site, with
four mounds, as a lesser center for a constituent
group in the Hatley Creek valley, but our feeling
is that this is not the case, based largely on the
facts that it is so close to Pine Tree Mound and it
appears not to have many residential areas nearby.
Instead, as discussed earlier, we suspect that the
rituals performed there had a different role, for
example, to link the mounds at Pine Tree with
those at Hudnall-Pirtle. This issue can be cast
in a more-positive light, however, by seeing this
topic—identifying constituent groups archeologically—as one that could guide future research in
the area for years to come.
On one level (and perhaps largely because of
too little data), the Pine Tree Mound community
model differs from the Frankston-Allen phase one
in that it consists of a single main village tethered
to the sole major ceremonial center, all ringed by
a zone with moderately scattered settlements and
a sparsely settled zone beyond. The two models
share the same basic building blocks, however,
consisting of places considered sacred where

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
ceremonial activities were concentrated and places
where people lived and grew their crops, and they
describe the same phenomenon, i.e., development of
regional communities with their own sociopolitical
identities, happening among related peoples at the
same time in neighboring parts of the Caddo area.

The Pine Tree Mound community did not exist in isolation from the wider Caddo world. The
deepest connections were with Caddo groups living in the Cypress Creek drainage just to the north
and northwest. These groups belonged to what
archeologists have labeled the Titus phase (Figure
15). There also was interaction with Belcher phase
groups who lived along the Red River to the east
and northeast, Frankston phase peoples in the upper Neches/Angelina basin, perhaps the Texarkana
and McCurtain phase Caddo who lived on the Red
River at and above the Great Bend, and maybe
even Mid-Ouachita phase groups in south-central
Arkansas. The following paragraphs address the
ODWWHU? RI? WKHVH? ÀUVW? EHFDXVH? WKH? GDWD? DUH? OLPLWHG?
and straightforward. The remainder of the section
then looks at the more-complicated Titus phase
connections.
&RQQHFWLRQV?%H\RQG?WKH?1HDUHVW?1HLJKERUV
Clues about interactions with other groups
come from the kinds of stones that some of the tools
and ornaments from the Pine Tree Mound site are
made of. The vast majority of the lithic artifacts
are of materials that could have been obtained locally, but small numbers came from the Ouachita
Mountains of Oklahoma and Arkansas or gravels
redeposited in the Red River from the Ouachitas
(cherts of gray, white, black, and some other colors;
novaculite; Stanley/Jackfork sandstone; basalt or
EDVDOW?SRUSK\U\??DQG?DQ?XQLGHQWLÀHG?LJQHRXV?URFN ??
Given the source areas, these nonlocal rocks may
indicate interaction with McCurtain, Texarkana, and
even Mid-Ouachita phase peoples, though it also is
possible these artifacts reached the site via its closer
Titus and Belcher phase neighbors. Particularly
notable are the three sets of stone ear spools recovered from three of the graves. These are similar
in form and size to two sets of ear spools from the
Belcher phase Foster site in southwestern Arkansas

65

(Weinstein et al. 2003:522–523), and we speculate
that the craftsmen who made these items were residents of that region and obtained the argillite they
are made of there. Least prominent in the collection
are artifacts of materials that appear to be from central Texas (light to medium brown and gray, often
mottled, chert) and the southern part of east Texas
(Manning Formation tuff), these probably were
introduced through contact with Frankston phase
peoples. The overall infrequency of these tools and
ornaments, and the fact that many were included
as grave offerings, indicate they were not mundane
items. Instead, most were prized symbols of power,
authority, status, or role, as well as symbols of the
connections that tied elite members of the Pine Tree
Mound community to their peers in neighboring
DQG?PRUH?IDU?ÁXQJ?&DGGR?FRPPXQLWLHV??FHPHQWLQJ?
relationships between them.
The ceramics at Pine Tree Mound that most
clearly are imports from non-Titus phase groups
are a small Cass Appliqued jar, a small Cowhide
Stamped jar, a large Hodges Engraved bottle, a
medium-sized Poyner Engraved bowl, a small
Poyner-like bottle, and 10 Belcher Ridged sherds.
Some of the vessels are small and could have been
transported easily, with the Pine Tree Mound people perhaps more interested in their contents than
the vessels themselves. The Cass Appliqued jar
suggests interaction with Texarkana phase groups,
though perhaps via Titus peoples, while the two
Poyner Engraved and Poyner-like vessels indicate
connections to Frankston phase groups.
The Belcher Ridged sherds certainly point
eastward, as do the Hodges Engraved bottle and
the Cowhide Stamped jar. Other connections to
the Belcher phase can be seen in the ritual utilization of four-quartered pedestal bowls and smoking
pipe forms. Four-quartered pedestal bowls similar
to Vessel 1 in burial Feature 8.1085 were found in
one Belcher site grave and in graves at the Foster
site (Webb 1959:Figure 83m; Weinstein et al.
2003:524–525). We have linked this vessel form
to belief in a four-quartered, multilevel cosmic
order, and hence its occurrence in burial contexts
in multiple places probably indicates shared beliefs
and rituals. A Pine Tree Mound ceramic smoking
pipe form with the distal end wrapping up around
the bowl also is seen at the Foster site (Weinstein
et al. 2003:516, 565–566).
An emphasis on Belcher connections is not
surprising, of course, given its location relative
to Pine Tree Mound. It may even be that the Red

to see the origins of the kind of pottery that plays
such a prominent role not only at Pine Tree but also
LQ?WKH?7LWXV?SKDVH??5LSOH\?(QJUDYHG??6SHFLÀFDOO\??
we are talking about the types Haley Engraved (for
bottles) and Handy Engraved (for bowls), which
are characteristic of the earlier Haley phase of the
Red River just below the Great Bend (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:60–63).
For instance, the Haley Engraved bottles recovered by C. B. Moore from nine burials below
the northwestern mound at the Haley site show
the use of the scroll and half scroll motifs with
pendant triangles and the concentric circles motif with central cross or open circle, which are
also decorated with pendant triangles (Weinstein
et al. 2003:465–475). These motifs are common
on Ripley Engraved bottles from the burials at
Pine Tree. Other elements used on both Haley
and Ripley bottles are the SZ and curl elements.
However, Haley and Ripley bottles differ in form,
with Haley bottles having a barrel-shaped body
and a neck that tapers only slightly toward the
lip, contrasting with the Ripley bell-shaped body
and neck that flares at both ends. Handy Engraved
bowls are more similar to forms common in Ripley, including carinated and compound bowls with
peaked, scalloped, and punctated lips (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:64). These similarities of motif and
form suggest that the type Ripley Engraved, made
so commonly by both the Pine Tree Mound and
Titus phase Caddo during Late Caddo times, may
have developed out of a ceramic tradition with its
roots in the Red River valley to the east. Supporting this contention is the fact that one of the utility
wares that occurs both at Pine Tree Mound and
Titus sites, Pease Brushed-Incised, also occurs in
Haley phase contexts (Hoffman 1970:171). This
implies that connections between these regions
were deep and long lasting.

To understand the things that unite the Pine

its nearest neighbor, the Titus phase, it is necessary
ÀUVW?WR?OD\?RXW?VRPH?VSHFLÀFV?DERXW?WKH?FXUUHQW?VWDWH?
of knowledge of what the Titus phase represents.
Fortunately, it is one of the most thoroughly studied
Caddo spatio-temporal units (e.g., Perttula 1992,
2004a, 2005b; Perttula and Sherman 2009; Thurmond 1981, 1985, 1990; Turner 1978).

Summary of the Titus Phase
The Titus phase is a Caddo archeological
manifestation that existed in the Cypress Creek
EDVLQ? IURP? WKH? ÀIWHHQWK? WR? VHYHQWHHQWK? FHQWXULHV?
(ca. A.D. 1430 to 1680) (Perttula and Sherman
2009:382–386). Its main part extended for about
75 km along Big Cypress Creek, encompassing
some 1,350 km2 (Figure 16). Beyond this heartland
is a much larger area, bringing in another 6,240 km2
and extending south to the Sabine River, west to the
Lake Fork Creek basin, north to the Sulphur River,
and east to Black Cypress Bayou and Potters Creek
(Perttula 2004a:Figure 13.27), that traditionally
has been viewed as having been the homelands of
JURXSV? DIÀOLDWHG? ZLWK? WKH? 7LWXV? KHDUWODQG? JURXSV??
The Pine Tree Mound site is at the southeast corner
of this greater Titus phase area.
Sites in the Titus heartland are thought to
UHÁHFW? D? VRFLRSROLWLFDO? V\VWHP? VLPLODU? WR? WKH? KLVtoric tribal confederacies of the Hasinai to the
south and Kadohadacho to the north (Perttula
2004a:396–398). As such, Titus phase communities
were organized hierarchically with elite members
more or less controlling the economic output of
WKHLU?DIÀOLDWHG?JURXSV??H[WHQGHG?IDPLOLHV??RU?FODQV?
In his comprehensive study of the archeology
of this area, Thurmond (1981, 1990) recognized a
variety of site types, including small settlements,
large settlements, limited-use areas, mounds, and
large community cemeteries, and suggested that
there were four contemporaneous and spatially
distinct subclusters of sites that could represent

based on shared arrow point and ceramic types and
distinctive Ripley Engraved ceramic bowl motifs,
with different motifs considered likely signals of
JURXS?DIÀOLDWLRQ??7KRXJK?WKH?LQWHUSUHWLYH?YDOXH?RI?
those particular subclusters has not held up well
over the ensuing years, the idea behind them was
important nonetheless. The Titus phase, even just its
heartland, covers a large area containing very similar
archeological remains representing a large number
of Caddo people. Surely there is something in the
spatial arrangement of these sites that relates to how
those people were organized socially and politically.
More-recent investigations have gone beyond
Thurmond’s work by developing a model of Titus
phase settlement patterning consisting of contemporaneous dispersed farmsteads or villages forming a

communities have been proposed for the part of the
heartland downstream from Tankersley Creek (Perttula and Sherman 2009:376–377). One community
sits at the southeast end of the heartland. Whelan
??05? ?? D? VLWH? ZLWK? IRXU? PRXQGV? DW? WKH? FRQÁXence of Arms Creek and Big Cypress Creek, is the
community’s key site (Figure 17). The H. R. Taylor
(41HS3) and Pea Patch (41HS825) sites nearby, with
more than 150 graves, may have been that community’s main cemeteries. Moving northwestward,
the other four communities were anchored by the
following: (1) in the vicinity of Meddlin Creek, the
four mounds at the Harroun (41UR10) site and three
mounds at the Chastain/Dalton/Camp Joy (41UR11,
41UR18, and 41UR144) complex, along with community cemeteries at Pleasure Point (41MR63),
Henderson-Southall (41UR3), Big Oaks (41MR4),
and Sandy Creek (41MR122), which probably contained more than 500 graves; (2) the single-mound
Shelby (41CP71), P. S. Cash (41CP2), and Sam
Roberts (41CP8) sites on Greasy and Prairie Creeks,
with community cemeteries at Shelby and the Gold
Star Ballroom site (41UR107) containing more than
250 graves; (3) the community cemeteries at Tuck
Carpenter (41CP5) and Harold Williams (41CP10),
with more than 166 graves, on Dry and Swauano
creeks and maybe the community cemetery at the
W-S site with 118 graves not far away, perhaps
accompanied by the single-mound Tom Hanks site
(41CP239); and (4) the single-mound Pilgrim’s
Pride site (41CP304) on Walker Creek and perhaps
Tiddle Lake (41CP246) with another mound nearby.

communities were present on Big Cypress Creek
upstream from Tankersley Creek as well, as this area
contains at least one large community cemetery with
more than 150 graves, Sandlin Dam (41TT726), and
another cemetery, Lower Peach Orchard (41CP17),
ZLWK???²???JUDYHV?LQFOXGLQJ?ÀYH?RU?VL[?ODUJH?VKDIW?
tombs (Perttula 2005b:371, 374, 380, 385).
Residential sites consist of small settlements
(0.2 to 1.8 hectares) marked by midden and daub
concentrations; these make up 73 percent of the
known Titus phase sites, while larger settlements
comprise only 4 percent (Perttula 2004a:398). One
large settlement that has been investigated recently
is the Pilgrim’s Pride site (41CP304) at the conÁXHQFH? RI? %LJ? &\SUHVV? DQG? :DONHU? FUHHNV? 3HUWtula 2005a). The site consists of four to six circular

69

structures with adjacent middens, many pit features,
burials associated with structures, a planned cemetery, and a 6.5-m-diameter mound built over a
possible ritual structure. Structures that were likely
domiciliary were about 6 to 8 m in diameter with the
most complete one having a southern entryway. All
of the major features appear to have a north-south
organization, with the mound and ritual structure
on the north, planned cemetery on the south, and
houses in between.
There are 11 known mound sites (or nine if
Chastain, Dalton, and Camp Joy are counted as a
single complex) within the Titus phase heartland;
all are considered key sites, serving as ritual centers that drew together the dispersed residential
units. Six sites have single mounds, one has three
mounds, and two have four mounds. Most of the 17
small rounded mounds apparently were erected to
cap burned ceremonial structures, some of which
had extended entryways (one mound at the Harroun
site was put atop a grave). Perttula and Sherman
(2009:389–391) suggest that the timing of moundbuilding events may have coincided with the deaths
of important people who were laid to rest elsewhere.
Radiocarbon dates indicate that mound use continued throughout the phase (Perttula and Sherman
2009:387).
All three of the known multiple-mound sites
(Whelan, Harroun, and the Chastain/Dalton/Camp
Joy complex) are in the southeastern part of the
heartland (Perttula and Sherman (2009:389). This
suggests that not all communities along Big Cypress
Creek participated in political and social life in
the same way and gives support to the idea that a
hierarchical cultural system prevailed here. Perttula
and Sherman (2009:392) also point to the limited
residential features at the Whelan and Harroun
sites as an indication that the religious and political
leaders at these sites maintained separation from the
JUHDWHU?SRSXODWLRQ?DQG??LQ?GRLQJ?VR??VROLGLÀHG?WKHLU?
authority through regulation of ritual and resources.
This does not appear to have been the case at mound
sites farther up the Big Cypress, however, where
Perttula and Sherman (2009:392) see no separation
of the mound sites from the greater communities.
Again, this indicates differences between Titus
SKDVH?FRPPXQLWLHV?ZLWKLQ?DQ?RYHUDUFKLQJ?VWUDWLÀHG?
social and political system.
Status differences also may be recognizable
within Titus communities based on how they
treated their dead. Two kinds of cemeteries have

family cemeteries with few interments (ca. 10 to
40 individuals) that are directly associated with
habitation sites and large community cemeteries
(70–200+ individuals) that are divorced from
habitations. Individuals buried in family cemeteries
usually show little distinction in burial offerings
that may indicate differences in status (Perttula
2005b:383). Thurmond (1990:235–236) notes that,
in family cemeteries, offering associations appear to
be determined by age and sex instead. Some burials
in community cemeteries provide the best evidence
for an elite segment of the society, as they appear
to be planned space with an elite individual placed
at the center and regular rows of interments. These
HOLWH? LQGLYLGXDOV? DUH? LGHQWLÀHG? E\? WKH? SUHVHQFH? RI?
rare offerings in their graves, large numbers of
offerings, and unique modes of burial such as shaft
graves, litter burials, or multiple interments (Perttula
2004a:401).
Thirteen community cemeteries are known.
Twelve are in the heartland (the other is in the
Little Cypress Creek basin), with six being in the
southeastern part where the multiple mound sites are
(Perttula 2004a:Figure 13.31). Because of their size,
the presence of elite members of the society, and
their positions away from residential areas, Perttula
(2004a:401–403) considers them to be equivalent
to mound centers as places that served integrative
functions.
One commonality in the graves, elite and commoner alike, relates to grave orientation and body
placement. The deceased generally were placed on
their backs with legs extended and arms at their
sides. Grave orientation was generally east to west
or northeast to southwest with head placement to the
east or northeast (Perttula 2005b:380–385; Turner
1978:52). To account for this general consistency
and explain slight variations, Turner (1978:49–60)
shows that burial orientation could have been based
on the setting sun as its direction varied through the
year. This may mark an important commonality of
belief that Titus phase groups held that differentiated
them from some other Caddo groups.
Titus phase peoples produced or acquired a
rich and varied ceramic assemblage consisting of
grog- and grog/bone-tempered wares that included
carinated bowls, compound bowls, square bowls,
SHGHVWDO? ERZOV?? UDWWOH? ERZOV?? ]RRPRUSKLF? HIÀJ\?
bowls, bottles, ollas, everted-rim jars, and globular
jars. Fine ware types include Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Wilder Engraved, Bailey Engraved,
Avery Engraved, Simms Engraved, and Belcher

71

Engraved, with Ripley constituting on average
49 percent of the vessels placed as burial offerings (Perttula and Sherman 209:397). Wilder and
Taylor Engraved typically make up 3 and 5 percent
of the burial collections. Utility wares consist of
a variety of small to large jar forms and include
La Rue Neck Banded, Karnack Brushed-Incised,
Harleton Appliqued, and Bullard Brushed (Perttula
2004a:404–406).
Perttula and Sherman (2009:397–401) see an
east-west split in the ceramic tradition somewhere
between Greasy Creek and Dry Creek in the heartland. In the western sites, trade wares such as Avery
Engraved from McCurtain phase sites on the Red
River to the north are more common in burial assemblages. For utility wares, La Rue Neck Banded jars
are more frequent, as are plain vessels and untyped
jars. In the eastern sites, Taylor, Bailey, and Simms
Engraved appear as important secondary types along
with trade wares from the Belcher phase on the Red
River to the east. Utility wares for the eastern sites
include more Harleton Appliqued, Bullard Brushed,
and Karnack Brushed-Incised jars. Though Ripley
Engraved dominates both subtraditions, the bowl
motifs differ. Pendant triangle and interlocking horizontal scroll motifs are more prevalent in the eastern
sites, while the western sites have bowls that display
scroll, continuous scroll, scroll and semicircle,
horizontal diamond, and bisected diamond motifs
(Perttula and Sherman 2009:400).
The east-west ceramic dichotomy is evident
even in the harder-to-interpret sherd collections
from residential contexts (Perttula and Sherman
2009:400). Eastern heartland sites have more

EUXVKLQJ?RQ?XWLOLW\?MDUV??ZKLFK?PD\?KDYH?EHHQ?LQÁXenced by similar vessel decoration used by Belcher
phase potters. In the west, undecorated and neck
banded sherds are more prevalent (Perttula and
Sherman 2009:403). In addition, red-slipped sherds
are more common in the west.
Differences in burial vessels and sherd assemblages, mound-building activity, and community
cemeteries suggest that the Titus heartland contains
the archeological expressions of multiple communities with differing degrees of interrelatedness.
In terms of hierarchical organization, a case can
be made for two core communities, each covering about 675 km2 and encompassing a number of
smaller communities marked by the key sites as
proposed by Perttula and Sherman (2009:335–337).

eastern and western core communities may have

Creek and Dry Creek along Big Cypress Creek, i.e.,
EHWZHHQ? WKH? WKLUG? DQG? IRXUWK? RI? WKH? ÀYH? KHDUWODQG?
communities listed above. What this model does
not address is how best to interpret Titus phase sites
outside the heartland. Were they aligned in some
way with the two core communities noted above,
or were they equivalent core communities within an
overarching confederation? The Pine Tree Mound
community is one place to look for part of an answer
to that question.
Pine Tree Mound:
Another Titus Core Community?
We think that Pine Tree Mound can be interpreted as the key site in a third major Titus core
community, one that has both important similariWLHV?WR?DQG?GLIIHUHQFHV?IURP?WKH?WZR?GHÀQHG?IRU?WKH?

radiocarbon dates, ceramic tradition, mound construction and organization of ritual space, burial
ritual, and geography.
5DGLRFDUERQ?'DWHV
Radiocarbon dates leave no doubt that the
Pine Tree Mound community and Titus phase were
contemporaneous. The 102 good radiocarbon dates
from Pine Tree indicate that the primary occupation
there started by A.D. 1350 and lasted till perhaps
the mid-1600s; it also was used in the 1700s,
though this occupation may have had little to do
with the earlier one. There are another 29 dates in
this span from eight other sites nearby (Dockall
and Fields 2011; Dockall et al. 2008; Gadus et al.
2006), bringing the total number of radiocarbon
dates for the Pine Tree Mound community to 131.
We consider it well dated.
The Titus phase also is well dated, with Perttula and Sherman (2009:383–384) listing 91 raGLRFDUERQ?DVVD\V?IURP????VLWHV?DQG?+DWÀHOG?HW?DO??
(2008) adding 16 more from three sites for a total
of 107 dates. The span indicated is A.D. 1430 to
1680. While this makes it look like the Titus phase
started almost a century later than Pine Tree, that
impression evaporates if the poorly understood
Whelan phase is added in. Typically thought
to have started around 1350 and to have been

ancestral to the Titus phase, Whelan is a construct
that probably should be discarded (Davis et al.
2010:45–46, 99–102; Perttula 1992:106–107). It
is just the beginning of the Titus phase, paralleling
the early end of the record at Pine Tree.
&HUDPLF?7UDGLWLRQ
There is a strong connection through a shared
ceramic tradition between the Pine Tree Mound
site and Titus phase communities to the north and
northwest. The ceramic assemblage that is local to
Pine Tree, consisting of a wide variety of Ripley
Engraved bowls and bottles, Wilder Engraved
bottles, many untyped engraved bowls and bottles
as well as undecorated ones, Pease Brushed-Incised
jars, maybe Harleton Appliqued and Maydelle
Incised jars, a variety of untyped jars decorated
mostly with brushing, and mostly undecorated
ollas, has much in common with assemblages
found at Titus sites, and it is certain that some of
the vessels recovered from the Pine Tree Mound
graves—most obviously a small Taylor Engraved
jar and a medium-sized Karnack Brushed-Incised
jar—are imports from the north.
Other pots likely originated there too, and the
fact that there are six analyzed ceramics from Pine
Tree that appear to be local on subjective grounds
but non-local based on instrumental neutron activation analysis or petrographic evidence supports
this. These six consist of a Ripley Engraved bowl,
two Ripley bottles, a Pease Brushed-Incised jar,
and two untyped brushed jars. We are equally certain that there are vessels found at Titus sites that
ZHUH?PDGH?DW?3LQH?7UHH??UHÁHFWLQJ?FRQQHFWLRQV?WKDW?
extend beyond sharing a tradition to interacting
frequently and exchanging goods and ideas.
Similarities are evident even at the sherd level.
For example, the high incidence of brushing (48 to
56 percent) in the sherd samples associated with
the Pine Tree Mound village areas is very similar
to the preponderance of this surface treatment in
the eastern Titus heartland. More dramatic, though,
is the predominance of Ripley Engraved at Pine
Tree. Ripley vessels make up 40 percent of the Pine
Tree Mound mortuary assemblage, comparable
to the numbers from such Titus phase cemeteries
as Mockingbird (42 percent) and Tuck Carpenter
(54 percent). In fact, some of the Ripley Engraved
vessels from Pine Tree could get lost within the
assemblage from Tuck Carpenter, and vice versa.
Certain Ripley vessel forms, such as bowls with

peaked or scalloped rims and square bottles,
occur in the graves at both sites, and there is a
single example of a pedestal bowl at each (Turner
1978:81–99). Many of the motifs and elements on
the Ripley bottles and bowls from Pine Tree—for
instance, concentric circles, concentric circles/diamonds, medallions, slanted and straight scrolls, and
half scrolls—also occur at Tuck Carpenter.
These shared motifs occur in different percentages in the two assemblages, however. Scrolls and
half scrolls on bottles are common in the Pine Tree
Mound graves (n=5, 30 percent of Ripley bottles)
but infrequent at Tuck Carpenter (n=1, 6 percent).
The concentric circles motif is the most common
one on Ripley bottles from the latter (n=9, 50 percent), most often associated with square vessels
(n=7, 39 percent). At Pine Tree, only three (18 percent) of the Ripley bottles are square. Also at Tuck
Carpenter, Wilder Engraved bottles with their
characteristic interlocking spirals occur almost as
frequently (n=15, 35 percent of bottles) as Ripley
bottles (n=18, 42 percent). At Pine Tree Mound,
however, only 15 percent (n=5) of the bottles are
Wilder Engraved.
Ripley carinated bowls with scroll motifs are
common in both assemblages, with 126 (75 percent
of all bowls) of those from Tuck Carpenter and 27
(54 percent) from Pine Tree displaying some variation of the motif. The slanted scroll with no central
element variation is more prominent at the former
(n=44, 35 percent) than the latter (n=5, 10 percent),
though, and the Tuck Carpenter graves produced
13 examples (10 percent) of a straight scroll with
diamonds and circles as central elements and pendant triangles as secondary elements (the traditional
SHQGDQW?WULDQJOH?PRWLI?GHÀQHG?E\?7XUQHU?>????@?DQG?
Thurmond [1990]), while Pine Tree had no bowls
with this particular design. The Pine Tree Mound
graves did contain two bowls that are variations on
this theme, however, one with a straight scroll with
a diamond central element but no pendant triangles
and another with a half scroll, central circle, and
pendant triangles. So, the same elements are present, but they were combined or executed in different
ways at the two sites. Other differences include more
bowls with peaked or scalloped rims at Pine Tree
(n=26, 36 percent of bowls) than at Tuck Carpenter
(n=18, 11 percent). Also, the latter produced small
QXPEHUV?RI?UDWWOH?DQG?DQLPDO?HIÀJ\?ERZOV?ZKLOH?WKH?
Pine Tree Mound graves had none.
We believe the similarities in the pottery
represent a single shared ceramic tradition among

multiple closely related groups of people. The
differences relate to variable preferences for how
to construct motifs that reflected widely held
beliefs, with some apparently intended to convey
information about identity at the community,
lineage, or family level. Thus, variation in motif
construction can be seen as varied ways of
projecting a single message that bound Titus phase
communities together.

One of the main things that appears to set the
Pine Tree Mound site apart from Titus phase sites
relates to the nature of the mounds constructed at
both. As noted, there are 17 recorded mounds in
the Titus heartland, none of which are known to be
platform mounds (Perttula and Sherman 2009:387–
389). All are small, and all of the excavated ones
except one at the Harroun site are the result of dirt
being piled up to cap burned ceremonial structures.
Hence, they are similar to Mound B at Pine Tree
and unlike Mounds A and C, which were built rapidly, likely to support important buildings on their
summits (with Mound C and probably Mound A
also having such structures beneath them). Titus
phase peoples apparently did not build mounds to
serve as platforms for such structures, implying sociopolitical or religious differences between them
and the Pine Tree Mound Caddo.
,W?LV?GLIÀFXOW?WR?NQRZ?MXVW?KRZ?PXFK?WR?PDNH?RI?
this, though, partly because we do not know much
about some of the Titus mounds. In fact, it is possible to see similarities in the use of ritual space
and site layout that unite the Pine Tree Mound site
and the Titus phase. While it is true that there are
QR?7LWXV?VLWHV?WKDW?KDYH?VXFK?FOHDUO\?GHÀQHG?ULWXDO?
spaces as the ceremonial precinct at Pine Tree,
with its large platform mound at one end of the
plaza and community cemetery at the other, smaller
platform mound on the east side of the plaza,
and non-platform mound on the west side of the
plaza, it is not hard to see the arrangement of the
mounds at what may be the premier mound site in
WKH?7LWXV?SKDVH??:KHODQ??DV?UHÁHFWLQJ?D?VWUXFWXUHG?
ceremonial place. The four mounds there form
a rough crescent around the south side of what
could be a plaza measuring some 220 m across
(Davis et al. 2010:16). It is even possible that one
or both of the unexcavated mounds there could be
a small platform mound like Mound C at Pine Tree.

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
Further, Perttula and Sherman (2009:392) suggest
that the dense midden deposits there indicate it
was the scene of communal feasting associated
ZLWK?UHSHDWHG?ULWXDO?XVH??$QG?ÀQDOO\??WKH?SRVLWLRQ?
of Mound D relative to Mound A at Whelan (328º
east of north) is close to the orientation of Mound B
relative to Mound A at Pine Tree (320º). We argue
that this northwest-southeast axis, also common
to the grave orientations, is related to a particular
astronomical alignment, that of the bright red star
Antares. Mounds B and C at Whelan are oriented
more easterly relative to Mound A (79 and 74º)
than the relationship between Mounds C and A at
Pine Tree (63º), but still within the range of what
we have proposed as the orienting principle, i.e.,
sunrise position. These patterns suggest that the
Pine Tree Mound Caddo and at least the eastern
Titus phase Caddo shared some important ideas
about the nature of the cosmos, implying a strong
degree of connectedness.
Of course, it is possible to see this same phenomenon occurring over a much larger area as well.
One example of this can be seen at the Belcher
site, where an axis projected though the centers of
Mounds A and B and extending through the center
of Houses 5 and 6 on and beneath the lower mound
nearby measures 330º east of north, i.e., northwestsoutheast (Webb 1959:13). The houses associated
with the Belcher mounds had extended entryways
IXUWKHU?UHÁHFWLQJ?WKHLU?ULWXDO?LPSRUWDQFH??DQG?WKRVH?
entryways were oriented perpendicular to the 330º
axis of the mounds, pointing in the direction of
the summer solstice sunrise (ca. 60º east of north).
The fact that similar orientations can be found for
mounds and burials at the Haley site upstream
from Belcher indicates that these orientations had
been used for a long time in this area (Weinstein
et al. 2003:441–443), and the arrangement of the
mounds at the Hudnall-Pirtle site on the Sabine
River may indicate the same for the vicinity of Pine
Tree Mound (Bruseth and Perttula 2006:Figure 2).
Similarities between the Pine Tree Mound and
Titus phase communities also extend beyond the
primary sacred places. If hierarchical social orders
GLG?H[LVW??WKHQ?RWKHU?NLQGV?RI?PRXQG?VLWH?FRQÀJXrations would be expected, and this appears to be
represented in both. One of the other two multiplemound Titus sites, Harroun (41UR10), has four
mounds arranged in a roughly linear fashion following the edge of the landform over a distance
of about 250 m (Jelks and Tunnell 1959:2). This
is very reminiscent of the Lane Mitchell site near

75

Pine Tree Mound, which, as discussed, has four
RU?ÀYH?VPDOO?PRXQGV?DUUD\HG?URXJKO\?OLQHDUO\?IRU?
a distance of about 130 m and no obvious plaza.
Both sites have little evidence for much residential occupation nearby. These may be places that
were used solely for ceremonial purposes and may
represent a different level of activity within the
community system.

A second important characteristic that appears
to separate the Pine Tree Mound community from
the Titus phase relates to burial ritual practices.
People at Pine Tree were buried with their heads to
the south or southeast, in contrast to the generally
eastward and northeastward orientation in Titus
phase graves (Perttula 2005b:381–384; Turner
1978:50–53, 75; Webb 1959:66). Probably more
than the apparent lack of platform mounds in Titus
VLWHV?? WKLV? VSHDNV? WR? ZKDW? OLNHO\? ZHUH? VLJQLÀFDQW?
differences in group identity. This characteristic
more than any other (at least among those we can
see archeologically) is what says that the Pine Tree
Mound Caddo considered themselves different than
the Caddo who lived in the Titus heartland.
It would be a mistake, though, to see these disWLQFW?LGHQWLWLHV?DV?UHÁHFWLQJ?VHSDUDWH?SHRSOHV??7KH?
evidence to the contrary, i.e., of groups who were
closely aligned and whose lives were intertwined,
is just too strong. There is even some evidence in
the burial data going beyond just head orientation
WKDW? SRLQWV? LQ? WKLV? GLUHFWLRQ?? 6SHFLÀFDOO\?? LW? DSpears that the path of souls mythology may have
had a role in the burial practices for both. This
interpretation hinges on the fact that the Milky
Way (the path of souls) changes its orientation in
the night sky, moving from generally west-east to
northwest-southeast to almost north-south over
the course of the year (Lankford 2007:205–206).
Thus, the Titus phase Caddo generally buried their
dead with their feet on the path of souls and their
heads to the rising sun. Those buried at Pine Tree
Mound also had their feet on the path of souls,
but their heads would have been aligned with the
Great Serpent as represented by Antares. The rising
sun was on their right hand. Thus, the Pine Tree
Mound and Titus phase Caddo may have adhered
to the same iconic system. Like the Skidi Pawnee
(Aveni 2001:304) for whom the location of each
village was associated with a particular asterism,
different burial alignments may be one way that

76

groups within associated communities differentiated themselves while still participating within the
wider Caddo society.
*HRJUDSK\
Geography offers the easiest part of the argument that Pine Tree Mound and associated sites
represent a third major Titus core community. The
main point here is that, unlike the two proposed
core communities in the Titus heartland that butt
up against each other, Pine Tree is well removed,
across the Cypress Creek-Sabine River divide,
about 20 km south of the east end of the heartland.
There are sites in between on Little Cypress Creek
that likely go with communities on Big Cypress to
the north, or maybe constitute another core community in its own right (the community cemetery
at the Spider Lilly site [41UR143] with 60+ graves
is in this area), but the Pine Tree Mound community still seems distinct spatially. With its own
ZHOO?GHÀQHG?PDLQ?ULWXDO?VSDFH?QHDU?WKH?QRUWK?HGJH?
of the community, subsidiary ritual space at Lane
Mitchell nearer the Sabine River, and residential
sites concentrated along Potters Creek but also
on other Sabine tributaries, it is a coherent unit
that stands apart from the Titus phase ones in the
Cypress Creek basin. Also relevant is the fact that
the main part of the Pine Tree Mound community
as we have reconstructed it, i.e., the part north of
WKH?6DELQH?5LYHU?ÁRRGSODLQ??FRYHUV?DQ?DUHD?WKDW?LV?
comparable in size (800–900 km2) to each of the
two core communities proposed for the heartland
(675 km2 each), suggesting similar settlement patterns and political organizations.
One other thing about the geography of Pine
Tree Mound that merits mention here, and that
applies equally well to the mound center at the
Whelan site, is that they are near the boundaries between the Titus phase and neighboring areas, with
Pine Tree at the southeast corner and Whelan near
the east edge. As such, they were in good places to
serve as portals to Belcher and Frankston phase territories to the east and south and to symbolize the
power of the Titus peoples to these other groups.
&RQFOXVLRQ
Identifying Pine Tree Mound as a third Titus
phase core community, comparable in size to the
two that make up the Titus heartland and rivaling
or exceeding them in terms of sociopolitical

complexity, raises the question of how useful
the heartland concept is. Because the Cypress
Creek valley appears to have been comparatively
densely settled, contained multiple smaller adjacent
communities within the two core ones, has at least
nine sites containing 17 mounds, and has at least 11
community cemeteries with the graves of close to
1,200 people or maybe more, it does seem logical
to think of it as the place many Titus peoples called
home. What Pine Tree Mound makes clear, though,
is that some communities outside the heartland, and
maybe many of them, were more than just distant
relations. The problems with the heartland concept,
which archeologists who have worked there
have long recognized, are that it says more about
differing intensities of archeological work than
it does about variability in archeological remains
across the landscape, and it automatically sets up a
heartland-periphery dichotomy that unfairly affects
how people think about the greater Titus phase.
Without doubt, the archeological evidence from
DOO?SDUWV?RI?WKH?7LWXV?DUHD?FRXOG?EHQHÀW?IURP?D?QHZ?
look, informed by what the Pine Tree Mound site has
taught us, to get a better picture of the Titus whole.
Clearly, Pine Tree was a powerful community
in its own right, with its own history. We propose
that this history grew out of what started at the
Hudnall-Pirtle site several centuries before the Pine
7UHH?0RXQG?VLWH?ZDV?IRXQGHG?DQG?ZDV?LQÁXHQFHG?
strongly by what was happening on the Red River
to the east and northeast. The Pine Tree community
may have been a fourteenth-century development
among essentially local Caddo groups, but it was
the combination of this with ideas, practices, and
PD\EH?HYHQ?SHRSOHV?IURP?LQÁXHQWLDO?JURXSV?OLYLQJ?
on the Red River that created the Potters Creek
version of the Titus phase Caddo. By the middle of
WKH?VL[WHHQWK?FHQWXU\??WKHVH?SHRSOH?ZHUH?LGHQWLÀHG?
as the Nadaco Caddo, or the people “of the place of
WKH?EXPEOHEHH?µ?DQG?LW?DSSHDUV?WKDW?WKH\?PD\?KDYH?
VWD\HG?WKHUH??DOEHLW?PXFK?PRGLÀHG?E\?WKH?HIIHFWV?
of European intrusions and movement of Caddo
and other native groups, through much of the
eighteenth century. Whether the Nadaco appellation could be applied to all of the Titus territory we
do not know, and probably never will, since parts
of the area apparently were abandoned by the late
seventeenth century and hence are missing from
the early Spanish and French accounts.
The evidence presented here indicates that
the boundary of the greater Titus area needs to be
pushed southward beyond the Sabine River, at least

Fields and Gadus—The Pine Tree Mound Site and the Archeology of the Nadaco Caddo
in the area of Rusk and Panola counties. We will
leave it to other researchers to look to see if that
needs to be done moving west on the south side of
the Sabine River. There certainly could be grounds
for doing it based on drainage patterns, but the real
test lies in what the archeology there looks like. It
would be interesting to see if the south side of the
Sabine River throughout this area was as sparsely
settled as the south part of the Pine Tree Mound
community was. If so, there was a large area that
both the Titus and Frankston phase peoples may
have viewed as open country. Also left to other
researchers is the question of whether the Titus
phase should be expanded down the Sabine River to
include the area of Toledo Bend Reservoir. Though
the ceramics from sites there are similar in some
ways to Titus pottery (Turner 1978:95–96) and some
sites have been considered to be associated with the
Titus phase (Perttula 1995:340), there is a countering school of thought that those sites were created
by local groups who were distinct from their Titus
and Belcher neighbors (Kelley 2006:64).
Finally, it is worth returning here to ask how
what was going on in the Pine Tree Mound and
other Titus communities relates to what we imagine
the sociopolitical system was based on historical
records. We have alluded to some aspects of this,
including discussion of Story and Creel’s (1982)
Anderson Cluster model, and we think a case can
be made that at least some parts of this model
apply to the greater Titus phase. The fundamental
question is whether there was a single main seat
of power and authority for the whole of the Titus
phase, i.e., the temple-residential complex of the
grand xinesi, and if so where it was. Pine Tree
Mound certainly would seem to be a candidate for
such a site, but we hesitate to proclaim it so for
two related reasons. First, we think it is important
not to bank too much on this one site, simply
because we know so much about it relative to
others. Second, there are at least two other Titus
localities, i.e., the Whelan site and the Harroun,
Chastain/Dalton/Camp Joy, and Pleasure Point
vicinity, that could be candidates for the premier
site, and we fear that what we know about them,
or what we think we know, is too skimpy to push
WKHP?RQH?ZD\?RU?WKH?RWKHU?ZLWK?JUHDW?FRQÀGHQFH??
If afforded the same level of investigation as Pine
Tree, they might look much different than they
do to us now. In short, we think the issue of Titus
phase sociopolitical organization remains an open
question that deserves continued debate, with the

77

evidence presented here on the Pine Tree Mound
site playing a key role in that discussion.

between ca. A.D. 1430-1680. These farming societies lived at the western edge of the eastern Woodlands in
Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma during repeated periods of droughty conditions, especially a major
cool and dry period from ca. A.D. 1430-1470.

The prehistoric occupation of the Big Cypress
Creek, Sabine River, and Sulphur river basins in
northeastern Texas by Titus phase Caddo peoples
began during the Late Caddo period, around A.D.
1430. These Caddo peoples were contemporaneous with various Plaquemine, Middle Mississippian, and South Appalachian aboriginal groups
living across eastern North America, as well as
with Plains Village communities in the southern
Plains to the west and northwest, and they were
a strong and powerful group of peoples (e.g.,
Early 2000, 2004; Perttula 2002, 2004; Calloway
2003:105-110; see Pauketat [2005] for a summation of the history of the Mississippian peoples).
They were farmers, as were other Mississippian
groups, living in dispersed communities, and they
were active traders, as we know from the wide
distribution outside the Caddo archeological area
(Rogers and Sabo 2004:Figure 1) of decorated
Titus phase pottery. The Titus phase Caddo groups
in the Big Cypress Creek basin were perhaps the
most populous and socially complex of the many
Caddo societies living in northeastern Texas at that
time. They were the westernmost aboriginal group
that was socio-politically akin to middle and late
Mississippian polities in the broader southeastern
U.S. region (Figure 1).
The Titus phase Caddo communities in the
heartland of the Big Cypress Creek basin were experiencing rapid and sustained population growth
GXULQJ?WLPHV?RI?ÁXFWXDWLQJ?FOLPDWLF?FRQGLWLRQV?LQ?
the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. These dynamic

farming communities dealt with climatic and subsistence stresses by effecting new means of holding
their societies together, boldly coming together into
several stronger political communities centered
around the establishment of larger mound centers,
community cemeteries, and villages at key nexuses
in the Big Cypress Creek basin (Figure 2). In the
words of George Sabo (2003:444-445), “Caddo

in times past—to shape identities and transfer
those identities from generation to generation,
HYHQ?LQ?WKH?IDFH?RI?GLVUXSWLRQ?DQG?ORVV?µ?,W?DSSHDUV?
that these Caddo communities made considerable
investment in the development of ceremonialism—in their construction of mound centers and
large community centers—and the end result was
long-term stability (cf. Marston 2011; Hunt and
Lip 2011:135, 144).

The Pilgrim’s Pride site (41CP304) on Big Cypress Creek is one of these newly created larger and
community-centered Caddo mound and village settlements (see Figure 2). These are places where the
most important and life-giving ceremonies, rituals,
and decisions were made by the social and political
elite that guided and organized the changing Titus
phase societies living along Big Cypress Creek.

appears to have been established around ca. A.D.
1430. Smaller farming households were dispersed
for several miles around the Pilgrim’s Pride site.
Life here was organized around the rhythm of
planting and harvesting the cultivated plant foods
(especially maize), men hunting large game, the
rituals and ceremonies of the seasons, and daily life
in the household and village settlements.
These Titus phase political communities generally, and the Pilgrim’s Pride in particular, are
located along and near the modern ecotone between
the Pineywoods and the Post Oak Savannah (Diggs
et al. 2006:Figures 1-5), with the latter lying on
sandy loam soils on the north side of Big Cypress
Creek (Figure 3). The Post Oak Savannah is a narrow strip of woodlands between the Pineywoods

to the east and south, with the Blackland Prairie
vegetational region to the west, north (Talco Prairie; see Figure 3) and northwest, no closer than 20
km away. According to Schmidly (2002:371), the
“topography is level to gently rolling and slopes

the post oak region can best be described as an
ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest and
the tall-grass prairie. The area supports a stunted,
open forest dotted with small tall-grass prairies.
The dominant plants of the overstory are post oak
and blackjack oak, and to a lesser extent winged

Post oak and blackjack oaks comprised between 28-35 percent of the tree species mentioned
in the area (see Table 1), and these two species

they were on the Titus County side (within the
modern boundaries of the Post Oak Savannah).

other hardwoods. The white and red oaks were

nut-bearing trees, as were hickory and walnut. This
forest mosaic tended to have a greater diversity of
species in canopy than the post oak-blackjack oak
or pine forests (Marietta and Nixon 1983). About
21-22 percent of the tree species in Camp and Titus
counties tabulated in Table 1 included these more
mesic upland forests. The distribution of mesic
forests appears to have been comparable on both
sides of Big Cypress Creek. Hickory, in particular,
preferred moist slopes as well as river bottoms

Supporting the hypothesized drier and warmer
cycles in the middle portion of the Late Holocene,
the Ferndale Bog pollen record indicates that the
peak in pine pollen was between ca. A.D. 200 to

1100 (Holloway 1994: Table I.2), while Bousman
(1998:207) notes one grass spike or peak in the
Weakly Bog in Central Texas that dates to about
1500-1600 years ago (ca. A.D. 400-500), with another between A.D. 1450 to 1550. These periods
were also slightly colder and drier.
For the last 1000 years or more, dendrochronological or tree-ring records that are relevant to
tracking paleoenvironmental change are the most
accurate and temporally sensitive data available on
Late Holocene environmental change (e.g., Stahle
1996). Tree-ring research in Texas, Arkansas, and
Louisiana, as well as the Southeast U.S., by Stahle
and Cleaveland (1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995)

but changing climatic and rainfall conditions and
trends for the general Trans-Mississippi South region (of which the Caddo area is a part).
Most notably, droughts are not uncommon in
the region in modern times (as can be attested by
2011 drought conditions in northeastern Texas),
and there were numerous wet and dry spells and
periods of climatic instability between ca. A.D.
1000-1700 and after, just as there were between
5000-1000 years ago (see Stahle and Cleaveland
1988, 1994). Some of the worse droughts may have
occurred around A.D. 1555, 1570, 1595, and 1670,
and the period between A.D. 1549 and 1577 has
been suggested to have had the worse droughts in
the past 450 years (Stahle et al. 1985).
More detailed analyses are available from bald
cypress tree-ring chronologies on spring rainfall
between A.D. 997 and 1988 from Big Cypress State
Park in northwestern Louisiana (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995; see also Tree-Ring Data Bank, IGBP
Pages/World Data Center for Paleoclimatology Program, Boulder, Colorado). Year by year changes in
prehistoric times indicate that the seven sets of wettest
years were between A.D. 1053 and 1057, 1168 and
1176, 1178 and 1180, 1265 and 1268, 1323 and 1328,
1553 and 1555, and between 1584 and 1586. The
wettest years in prehistoric times were about a decade
from 1168 to 1176 and 1178 to 1180 (Figure 4). These
years would likely have been optimal growing years
for Caddo horticultural groups, assuming a correlation between crop production and spring precipitation
values (cf. Anderson et al. 1995:265). The wetter
conditions would also likely have led to an increase
in the extent of swamp and wetland habitats in much
of the Big Cypress Creek basin, and a concomitant
expansion in the carrying capacity of woodland plants

Conversely, the driest years in prehistoric
and early historic times—between A.D. 1014 and
1016, 1215 and 1217, 1444 and 1447, 1455 and
1460, 1529 and 1533, 1653 and 1655, and between
1697 and 1699—may well have been periods when
food supplies were stressed. The climatic conditions during these times would have put at risk the

reserves from the cultivation of tropical cultigens,
as well as their chances of success in obtained good
maize harvests during these extended droughty
periods (see below). The very dry years between
A.D. 1444 and 1460 detected by the tree-ring record (see Figure 4) correlate well with the grass
spike/drier episode noted by Bousman (1998) from
the Weakly Bog pollen record. These droughts

forested habitats.

Looking at the period of wet and dry spells
from ca. A.D. 1000 to 1650, the wetter years
(>1400 standard ring width indices [sri]) were
more than two times as frequent as the driest and
droughty (<560 sri) years (see Figure 4). After ca.
A.D. 1430, the wetter years occurred less often,
some 55 percent less between A.D. 1600 and 1700
than in the ca. A.D. 1200 and 1400 period.
The frequency of very dry years remained rather
constant after ca. A.D. 1430 (and remained so until
the 1790s), but were conversely quite rare between
A.D. 1000 and 1400 (see Figure 4). Clearly then, if
the tree-ring data from Big Cypress State Park are
relevant to understanding local climatic conditions
in the Big Cypress Creek basin, Caddo settlement

Cypress Creek basin. There were major periods of
drought between A.D. 1444 and 1447, and between
1455 and 1460, in the early 16th century, the mid17th century, and then with regularity until the latter
part of the 18th century. During these times, the Big
Cypress Creek region was occupied by Titus phase
Caddo groups (see Figures 1 and 2).
Changes in solar radiation inferred from
atmospheric delta C14 variation (Bradley et al.
2003: Figure 6.13) also provide a useful climatic

the period between ca. A.D. 1300 and 1580 was
relatively warm. After A.D. 1700, about the time
that the Titus phase Caddo peoples abandoned the
northeastern Texas region, temperatures warmed
again, until a period of abrupt cooling in the early
part of the 19th century. Other reconstructions
of past temperature variability over the last 1000
years suggests that the 17th century was even
colder than previously thought, and much of the

More detailed paleoenvironmental reconstructions of past climatic episodes during the Titus phase
Caddo settlement of the Big Cypress Creek basin are
based on the previously discussed Big Cypress State
Park tree-ring data base and various reconstructions
of changes in temperature over the last 1000 years
(Figure 5) offered by Mann et al. (1998) and Crowley
2000). These reconstructions use a wide range of
proxies, such as tree rings, ice cores, and corals (see
Jones et al. 2001:662; Mann 2002).
The mean temperature reconstructions indicate that there has
been a general decline in temperature from about A.D. 1000
(if not earlier) to about 1900, with
a rapid warming after that time.
Crowley’s (2000) studies suggest
that prior to 1850, decadal-scale
changes in temperature variation
are due to low frequency changes
in solar irradiance and pulses in
volcanism that served as climatic
forcing mechanisms. The 11th

and wetter periods date from A.D. 1477 through
1524, 1539 through 1572, and from 1603 through
1670+. After 1670, the period from 1671 to 1676
was relatively dry and cool.
Based on mean tree-ring widths in the three
principal droughty climatic episodes, the most
sustained and persistent period of drought was at
the beginning of the Titus phase, in the A.D. 1430
to 1476 climatic episode (see Table 2). The three
peaks of drought conditions in A.D. 1444 to 1447,
1455 to 1460, and in 1472 to 1473 had mean tree
ring widths of only 370.5-556.0, between 40-60
percent lower than in times of an equitable climate
and average growing and moisture conditions. The
A.D. 1455 through 1460 drought was also a notably
colder era during the Titus phase.
The other two droughty climatic episodes were
also very dry (with mean tree-ring widths ranging
between 304 and 487.5), some 50 to 70 percent
lower than in average climatic conditions. These
drier and colder drought periods, and the four year
drought (A.D. 1651 to 1655) during the last mesic
period, did not generally last as long as the cold
and dry pulses during the A.D. 1430 to 1476 period. While the A.D. 1525 through 1538 droughty
period was quite dry, it was nowhere as severe a

drought as the drought in the mid-16th century that
Stahle et al. (2000:121) consider the “most severe

summer precipitation. Reconstruction of the spatial
extent of this mid-16th mega-drought by Cook et
al. (1999) suggests its effects were more severe
from southern Texas to the panhandle of Texas, and
then north and west into the southwestern U.S., and
were less intensely felt in the Caddo area.

climatic changes over inter-annual to decadal and
multi-decadal intervals. I am interested not only
in knowing if climatic changes disrupted ordinary
or traditional cultural responses of Caddo communities as well as whether Caddo peoples had the
means to respond to changes in climatic conditions
that may have exceeded normal annual and interannual variations.
Since by ca. A.D. 1300 the Caddo had become a society that was increasingly dependent
upon cultivated plant foods (see Perttula 2008),
it is reasonable to argue that “as agricultural food
SURGXFWLRQ?LQFUHDVHG?LQ?LPSRUWDQFH??ÁXFWXDWLRQV?LQ?

in no way do I mean to suggest that the impacts
of climate changes, no matter how deleterious,
were the root and deterministic cause of cultural
changes among the Titus phase Caddo peoples, or
that there is necessarily any connection between
the two. Rather, climatic changes at different scales
can be reasonably expected to “elicit adaptive

strategy of any peoples is divorced from the range
of habitats it exploits to survive and prosper. In
essence, therefore, what I want to do here is lay
the temporal and climatic framework to consider
how changes in habitat variability and climate may

the cultural responses of Titus phase agricultural
Caddo peoples living in the middle reaches of the
Big Cypress Creek basin, at the edge of the eastern
Woodlands of North America.
There may be some relevant comparisons to be
made between the climatic and native history of the
Titus phase Caddo peoples and what recent archeological, bioarcheological, and paleoenvironmental
research in the lower Mississippi valley has to say
about the mid-16th century societies living there
at the time of a mega-drought that lasted from the
1540s to the 1580s (Stahle et al. 2000; Fisher-Carroll 2001; Burnett and Murray 1993). This lengthy
period of drought is thought to have had major
effects on these native peoples, leading to a major
reduction in reproductive potential, agricultural
destabilization, social stresses, and “the abandonment of an entire region within a relatively short

droughty periods in Northeast Texas between A.D.
1430 and 1680 have affected the Titus phase Caddo
groups living in a number of Big Cypress Creek
political communities?
The droughty climatic episodes occurred about
every 35 to 48 years, or about once every generation, given that the average life span of Caddo
males and females in Late Caddo times was about
40 years of age (Derrick and Wilson 2001:Table
2). Thus, the memories of these droughts, and
the cultural ability to learn how to recognize and
respond to the signs and changes signaling the
onset of droughty conditions (i.e., social memory,
see McIntosh et al. 2000:24-25), were likely part
and parcel of the adaptive strategies and knowledge possessed by the Titus phase Caddo farming
peoples in managing subsistence risks. Even so, it
is unlikely that they were culturally prepared for
the onset of the most intensive droughty period
over the last millennium that occurred between
A.D. 1444 and 1460, or had the crop reserves on
hand to successfully withstand such lengthy very
cold and very dry conditions without other social
or cultural options at hand.
The more mesic periods between severe
droughty conditions also lasted between 35 and
49 years at a time (see Table 2). These periods
were warmer and wetter than times that came
before and after, and were periods of more equitable rainfall and increased net productivity and
carrying capacity of plants and animals in the Post
Oak Savannah and Pineywoods habitats that were
settled by the Titus phase populations. How are
these environmental changes linked to subsistence
and demographic changes, and what are the effects
of subsistence changes on reproductive potential
during equitable climatic episodes? We will turn
to these questions in the remainder of this article.
In Late Caddo Titus phase times, when the
Caddo peoples had a diet that primarily consisted
of cultivated plants like maize, beans, and squash,
insuring the continued success of agricultural
pursuits must have been of primary importance in
determining the location of individual farmsteads
and hamlets, as well as the community centers.
This is likely to have been even more the case
than it was in the Early or Middle Caddo periods
when Caddo peoples were not apparently quite so
dependent upon cultivated plants for their diet, or
at least that was the case until ca. A.D. 1300 to
1350 (see Perttula 1996, 2008; Dering 2004, 2005).

distribution of Late Caddo Titus phase sites during
times of climatic instability? What can be documented in this part of the Big Cypress Creek basin
(see Figure 2) is that the overall settlement pattern
was dispersed, in conjunction with a heightened
emphasis on situating sites along the secondary
streams and the spring-fed branches. These areas
may have had more dependable water, or more

would have been easier to clear along the more
RSHQ?XSODQG?IRUHVWV?WKDQ?LI?ÀHOGV?KDG?WR?EH?ORFDWHG?
in the more mesic valleys. The spatial dispersion
of settlements within the community would have
contributed to a reduction in food production risk
by growing crops across the widest range of suitable habitats as possible. Marston (2011:193) also
notes that “food sharing is a socially embedded
IRUP?RI?VSDWLDO?GLYHUVLÀFDWLRQµ?DQG?ULVN?PLWLJDWLRQ?
There are more Late Caddo Titus phase sites in
this part of the Big Cypress Creek basin than sites
found during earlier periods (Perttula 2004: Table
13.2), suggesting that the regional population was
quite a bit higher during the Late Caddo period (all
things being equal, especially the length of time
each settlement was occupied and the general shifting of populations across the landscape), and there
are several clusters of settlements that may represent parts of contemporaneous small communities
or villages. Titus phase cemeteries are particularly
common in sites located along Big Cypress Creek
itself, followed by other cemeteries on a series of
tributaries to Big Cypress Creek. The principal
tributary creek settings for Titus phase cemeteries are Swauano Creek, Boggy Creek, Dry Creek,
Arms Creek, Meddlin Creek, and Greasy Creek
(see Figure 2). The Late Caddo communities living
in the Pineywoods on the tributaries appear to represent recognizable concentrations of settlements,
mounds, and community cemeteries that constitute
distinct political and socially-linked communities.
A political community as used here is marked by
a cluster of interrelated settlements and associated
cemeteries that are centered on a key site or group
of sites distinguished by public architecture (i.e.,
earthen mounds) and large domestic village areas.
Perttula and Nelson (2003:34) have noted that
Late Caddo Titus phase sites are more common
south of Big Cypress Creek in the Pineywoods than
they are on the north side of the basin in the Post
Oak Savanna, or in other stream valleys (such as
Little Cypress Creek, White Oak Creek, or streams

91

in the Lake Fork Creek basin) in the Big Cypress,
Sulphur River, and Sabine River basins. Much of
the upper Sulphur and Sabine River basins were
abandoned after ca. A.D. 1430 (cf. Bruseth 1987;
Fields et al. 1997:91). Poorly drained and steeper,
rockier landforms on the east side of Big Cypress
Creek were also apparently not heavily settled by
Caddo peoples.
Regional settlement data for the Titus phase
does also suggest that this pattern in the spatial
distribution of sites may be part of a much broader
trend in the density of Late Caddo sites between
WKH?7LWXV?SKDVH?´KHDUWODQGµ?DQG?RXWO\LQJ?DUHDV?DOVR?
occupied by Titus phase Caddo peoples (Perttula
1998, 2004; Perttula and Nelson 2003). This trend
indicates that Titus phase sites—as well as Titus
phase sites with mounds and large community cemeteries—are more common across the landscape
from the Brushy Creek area downstream along
Big Cypress Creek than they are in the Post Oak
Savannah immediately north and northeast of Big
Cypress Creek. This distribution strongly suggests
that the density of Caddo peoples during the Titus
phase was more concentrated in the Big Cypress
Creek heartland in the Pineywoods, including its
PDQ\? VRXWKZDUG?ÁRZLQJ? DQG? HDVWZDUG?ÁRZLQJ?
tributaries, than it was elsewhere across the landscape then, or in earlier times.
It is not until the onset of the Titus phase about
A.D. 1430 that the Pineywoods were the scene of
large village settlements of Caddo farmers along
the western margins of the Post Oak Savannah and
Pineywoods ecotone. These villages were established during a major droughty period (ca. A.D.
1430 through 1476, see Table 2). At the same time,
there is evidence of a dramatic residential movement of Titus phase Caddo peoples (as marked
by the absence of sites) from much of the Post
Oak Savanna (e.g., Bruseth 1987:276-277, 280).
The movement, redistribution, or emigration of
Caddo peoples from more marginal settings may
have been the product of a response to periods of
stress and subsistence instability during this time
of climatic perturbations. Allen (2004:200-201) has
noted that populations living in temporally variable
environments—environments where the carryLQJ? FDSDFLW\? YDULHV? ZLGHO\? EHFDXVH? RI? VLJQLÀFDQW?
climatic turbations of some duration and relative
frequency, as is the case at the western edge of
the Eastern Woodlands—will frequently emigrate
during bad years rather than risk extinction or
catastrophic population losses.

during both dry and more mesic periods. Several
of these large village settlements were apparently
abandoned in the early to mid-17th century, however. The important villages are situated in similar
topographic settings in the Pineywoods, namely
DORQJ?WULEXWDU\?VWUHDPV?QHDU?WKHLU?FRQÁXHQFH?ZLWK?
Big Cypress Creek, but they are not found in the
Post Oak Savanna. They are marked by a higher
density of settlements around one premier community center (see Figure 2). These components
represent permanent, year-round, settlements
of horticultural peoples. The locations that they
chose to permanently settle and build structures
and other facilities at had to be situated in habitats
where suitable sandy soils were nearby that could
be worked with simple wood and bone digging
tools, and that the land they built their homesteads
and communities on had to be well-drained and
HOHYDWHG? DERYH? WKH? DQQXDO? ÁRRGV? DORQJ? %LJ? &\press Creek and its tributaries. They also had to
be in areas where wood and grass was plentiful
for house construction and refurbishing, as well as
near relatively plentiful or predictable fresh drinking water. The fact that the Titus phase settlements
are not found in any notable spatial clusters around
the larger and more important villages suggests that
the many resources that were needed by sedentary
Caddo populations to successfully live in the Big
Cypress Creek valley could best be exploited by
dispersing the groups in a variety of settings. In
turn, the religious and political elite at the community centers probably helped develop strategies
that controlled the redistribution and exchange of
resources in times of need, especially the redistribution of agricultural surpluses.
This dispersed settlement arrangement would
have also helped lessen the competition for plant
and animal resources, and would not have led to the
environmental degradation of suitable habitats by a
single large community. This would have been of
critical concern as a means of alleviating or minimizing stress during droughty periods for Caddo
peoples living along the margins of the Pineywoods,
in environmentally risky areas. It would also have
permitted the Caddo peoples to take advantage of
the diversity in habitats to exploit a number of them,

This seems to have been the case in parts of the
upper Sabine and Sulphur River basins after ca.

commented that “stresses on arboreal canopy

In the Titus phase, the tropical cultigen maize
(Zea mays L.) was a dietary staple, and domesticated beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were also an
important food source. Nuts and seeds were also
gathered, but they appear in some areas to have
been of lesser importance in the diet of Caddo
peoples than they had been between ca. A.D. 900
and 1350 (Rogers and Perttula 2004:37). In fact,
the subsistence evidence from Titus phase Caddo
sites in the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna, as
well as elsewhere in the Caddo archeological area
after ca. A.D. 1400, suggests the rather successful
development of a Caddo maize-based economy by
about this time. Dering (2005) does make a strong
argument, however, that the diet of Titus phase
Caddo peoples was a diverse mixture of cultivated
foods and gathered wild plants, especially hardwood mast (see also Dering 2004), and this diverVLÀFDWLRQ?ZRXOG?KDYH?EHHQ?DQ?DSSURSULDWH?VWUDWHJ\?

century (A.D. 1539 through 1572), and then again in
the early 17th century. During droughty periods (see
Table 2) that sometimes lasted for several years, the
effects of the droughts must have been localized in

Perttula—Risky Business: Caddo Farmers Living at the Edge of the Eastern Woodlands
the Pineywoods, because there is a general continuity of Titus phase settlement across many parts of the
Sabine and Big Cypress Creek basins that suggests
crops were successfully grown and harvested even
in these droughty periods.
The long-term storage of plant foods and seed
stock—perhaps in above-ground granaries like
WKH? RQH? DSSDUHQWO\? LGHQWLÀHG? DW? WKH? :KHODQ? VLWH?
(41MR2) community center (Thurmond 1990:168;
see Figure 2)—also would have helped to offset
losses from poor or failed harvests. Above-ground
granaries appear to have been a technological innovation whose purpose was to maintain agricultural
stability within local communities, by minimizing
the impact of risk (or at least redistributing the
ULVN ? DFURVV? WKH? FRPPXQLW\??7KH? ÀUVW? GRFXPHQWHG?
evidence for the use of above-ground granaries in
the northeastern Texas region may be from the late
village (ca. A.D. 1350 or 1375 through 1450) at the
Oak Hill Village (41RK214) in the middle Sabine
River basin. There, the granaries had no obvious entrance; instead, entrance to the structures was probably by a ladder to an elevated platform (Rogers and
Perttula 2004; Perttula and Rogers 2007:Figure 4d).
One granary there had a second line of post holes on
the interior of the structure, probably serving as the
supports for an interior compartment with good air
circulation and ready access.
Two Titus phase sites in the Little Cypress
Creek basin have bison skeletal remains, indicating
the exploitation during droughty periods of prairie
habitats to the northwest and west of Caddo settlements in the Pineywoods. The occurrence of bison in
prehistoric Caddo faunal assemblages is otherwise
quite rare in northeastern Texas sites. It is likely that
small herds of bison roamed the tall-grass prairie in
Late Holocene times, although it would have been
a considerable trek to the tall-grass prairies in the
upper Sulphur River basin (Figure 2) for Titus phase
hunters who did not yet have any horses. The high
density of arrow points and scraping tools, as well
as signs of intensive arrow point manufacture, at the
Ear spool site (41TT653) in the White Oak Creek
basin and Post Oak Savanna (Perttula and Sherman
2009), suggest that this particular Caddo population
was intensively but opportunistically exploiting
large game animals.
Stable carbon isotope values have been obtained from Late Caddo and post-1650 Caddo
burials along the Red River in northeastern Texas,
as well as from the Titus phase, and other Caddo
populations living in southwestern Arkansas, and

93

northwestern Louisiana (Perttula 1996:321; Rose
et al. 1998). Those mean values on collagen range
from –14.8 ± 1.35 ‰ (n=28) from ca. A.D. 1450
to 1650 Caddo sites and –14.2 ± 1.17 ‰ (n=18)
from protohistoric Caddo sites. In comparing these
Caddo stable isotope values to other generally
contemporaneous agricultural populations, such
as Cahokia and the American Bottoms along the
Mississippi River (Hedman et al. 2002); Iroquois
sites in Ontario, Canada (Harrison and Katzenberg 2003); Central Mexico; the Maya region in
Guatemala; or from coastal Ecuador (Smalley and
Blake 2003:Table 2) in South America, the latter
agricultural populations had more enriched isotope
values that ranged between –7.0 ‰ to –11.7 ‰.
These populations had very high maize diets,
actually about 15-50% higher than did the Titus
phase Caddo and other contemporaneous Caddo
groups living along the Red River. So while we

For Caddo communities living in certain parts
of the Post Oak Savanna and Pineywoods of northeastern Texas, the regional archeological information on the density and distribution of settlements
after ca. A.D. 1430 does not suggest that there was
a continual movement of settlements and communities to exploit new habitats during periods of
climatic instability. Further, this information does
not point to the fact that the Caddo were moving to
reoccupy more marginal areas that had been previously settled by Caddo farmers, or might have been
physically degraded by forest clearance and hunting impacts on game animals. There simply do not
appear to be Caddo sites dating after ca. A.D. 1430
in some areas (like the upper Sabine River and
upper Sulphur River basins) until a period of resettlement in the late 17th to early 18th century (cf.
Scurlock 1962). Instead, the archeological record

94

Texas Archeological Society

suggests a considerable movement or emigration
of people from west to east across the landscape,
in concert with the development of a number of
political communities in the Big Cypress Creek
basin during Titus phase times.
The pervasive evidence of regional abandonment, along with the eastward movement of Caddo
peoples in, and into, the Big Cypress Creek basin,
points to a broad and regional (or larger-scale)
cause. It is suggested that the root cause of the
Caddo abandonment of settlements of many sites
occupied around this time is paleoclimatic. Climatic proxies such as tree-ring data, reconstructed
northern hemisphere mean annual temperatures,
and solar radiation inferred from atmospheric delta
14C variation, all point to increasingly colder and
drier conditions beginning around A.D. 1375, and
lasting well into the 15th century. Peak periods of
colder temperatures and drier conditions occurred
between A.D. 1440 and 1470, when parts of northHDVWHUQ?7H[DV?ZHUH?GHÀQLWHO\?EHLQJ?DEDQGRQHG?E\?
a number of Caddo groups, while stronger and
socially-connected polities were developing in
other and less marginal parts of the region.
For Caddo societies that were dependent on
agricultural crops, but perhaps were living in
parts of the region that were more marginal (due
WR? VRLO? IHUWLOLW\?? UDLQIDOO?? LQFLGHQFH? RI? ÁRRGLQJ??
or incidence of droughty weather) for successful
crop production, repeated crop failures brought
on by cooler and droughty conditions extending
over several years may have had stressful, if not
disastrous, results for these Caddo. Having lived in
a region subject to repeated droughts, the Caddo
probably developed cropping and storage strategies
to successfully sustain themselves through a 1- or
2-year drought. But the likelihood of continued
poor harvests and the lack of storable food reserves
over a decadal-scale drought, when linked with
evidence for regional abandonment around A.D.
1450, suggests they were unsuccessful and they
abandoned those more marginal areas.
In the face of climatic unpredictability, and
risky agricultural practices, Titus phase Caddo
societies living along Big Cypress Creek and
tributaries in the East Texas Pineywoods developed social and political strategies to manage
and minimize environmental and agricultural
risks. Their efforts, particularly the creation of
distinctive political communities marked by the
development of monuments (earthen mounds and
large community cemeteries) represent the actions

and practices of many different Titus phase Caddo
groups to strongly integrate and bond together
with each other. This integration was not a form
of increasing social complexity so much as it was
the constructive actions of people to insure their
survival in stressful times.

to be refought until some resolution is attained,
for better or worse. Cultural chronology has been

site, which offers comparative clarity on this obscure part of the archeological record in Central
Texas, strongly contradicts some well-established
temporal constructs, but in the end is highly consistent with the regional data.

In drawing clear distinctions, some clarity might
be projected onto the multiple layers of evidence,
allowing development of a perspective on the cultural processes happening at the end of the Archaic.
Salient among these processes is the nature of the
transition between two major stages of prehistory,

the literature on Central Texas chronology, with
a focus on the various schemes for the end of the
Archaic period. The Siren site chronology is then
compared to the existing models, and similarities
and differences are addressed to propose a revised
chronology for the latter part of the Archaic and
the beginning of the Late Prehistoric. Finally, some
thoughts on future research directions are offered.

In 1958, Willey and Phillips, building upon
the efforts of many before them, established a
workable blueprint for the basic archeological unit
concepts. That work has been cited as the authority
in many of the Central Texas cultural chronologies
addressed in this article (i.e., Black 1989; Johnson
1987; Prewitt 1981, 1985). Accordingly, a brief
look at the basic concepts in that work is in order
prior to moving on to the implications for the Central Texas chronology.

101

Underlying Willey and Phillips’ (1958) effort
was a clear distinction between descriptive and
explanatory units––we return to that premise
momentarily. There are three primary partitions of
archeological units, which are descriptive: temporal,
spatial, and archeological. For the temporal aspects,
there are local and regional sequences. For spatial
divisions, there are sites, localities, regions,
subareas, and areas. Archeological units include
components, phases, and subphases (Figure 3). To
draw broader correlations among some of these
categories, horizons (broad spatial distributions with
shallow time depth) and traditions (fairly spatiallyVSHFLÀF? SDWWHUQV? ZLWK? GHHS? WLPH? GHSWK ?? DUH? FDOOHG?
integrative units. For the most part these are all
descriptive categories of analysis. The explanatory

but also a source of unending confusion, largely
because of its chimerical nature. Originally, it
was defined as an archeological unit consisting
of comparable components on different sites that
contained unifying characteristics distinguishing
them from others (Kidder et al. 1946; Willey and
Phillips 1958:21-22). As noted, it was largely
a descriptive unit. However, the meaning of a
phase became so intertwined with social and
ethnic correlations, developmental implications,
and spatio-temporal parameters that it became an
unwieldy construct, one comprising incongruous
parts (Johnson 1987).

phase to ethnic and social connotations, thereby
making it a theoretically untenable construct. This
was clearly the case in 1987, but in his earlier
discussion of the same issue, he seemed to go into
a fair amount of detail on the careful delineation

between archeological and socio-cultural facets
(Johnson 1967:1–10). That distinction is almost
entirely lost in his 1987 work, where Johnson
repeatedly referred to phases as socio-cultural or

“failure to illustrate in more detail the mechanics
of phase recognition has brought more than one
DUFKDHRORJLVW?WR?JULHIµ -RKQVRQ??????? ??
The effect of Johnson’s critique seems to have
been the abandonment of the notion of phase in
Central Texas chronology, although it has continued
in most other portions of the state. Prior to 1987,
nearly all Central Texas chronologies (e.g. Kelley
1947; Prewitt 1981, 1985; Shafer 1963; Sorrow et
al., 1967; Weir 1976a, 1976b) used phases or foci as
the basic unit. Since that time, the phase designation
has not been used in the more recent chronologies
(e.g. Black 1989; Collins 1995, 2004; Johnson
1995; Johnson and Goode 1994), and has become

increasingly uncommon in the regional literature.
However, Johnson’s formulation of phase oversteps the bounds of interpretive responsibility, and
a barrage of social theory applied to archeology
over the last 40 years has increasingly made that
case. Willey and Phillips (1958:49) said the social
“equivalent of ‘phase’ ought to be ‘society,’ and in a

XQLWV? LV? EHVHW? E\? WKH? PRVW? IRUPLGDEOH? GLIÀFXOWLHV??
most of which stem from the fact that the kinds of

There is a strong need to maintain the
distinction of a phase as strictly an archeological
unit separate from a socio-cultural one. First, the
interpretive gap between the two, which has been a

interrelationship between the material remains and
the society that produced them, precluding direct
correlations (Hodder 1991,1999; Meskell 2008;
Preucel 1991:3–14; Webster 2008:22). Secondly
and relatedly, careful maintenance of the longrecognized dictum that the archeological record is

(Ford 1954:47), the material remains of the cultures

building blocks of prehistoric reconstruction. By
maintaining a separation of the archeological

can be considered independently without undue

most notably at the basic comparative level within and among
sites. The problem can be ignored
by presenting broad syntheses,
but the nature of our objectives
in this article is to build up from

towards the broader frameworks.

The long efforts at imposing chronological
order on the archeological record in Central Texas
have been discussed many times (e.g., Black 1989;
Ellis 1994; Prewitt 1981; Suhm 1960). The literature, especially the vast collection of contract

cultural change and/or continuity at the end of the
Archaic. A review of the major works underlying
the main differences provides a foundation for a
comparative assessment and an unraveling of the
transition at the end of the Archaic in Central Texas.
Prior to 1960, most efforts used the Midwestern Taxonomic System, and consequently aspects
and foci were common divisions in early Central
Texas schemes (Figure 4). Johnson et al. (1962)

retaining the Toyah and Austin foci (Figure 5).
Importantly, Johnson et al. (1962) designated the
ÀQDO?FHQWXULHV?RI?WKH?$UFKDLF?VWDJH?DV?WKH?7UDQVLtional Archaic sub-period, in part because of the
similarities between the latest dart point types,
namely Darl and Figueroa points, and the earliest
arrow point types. The late dart points preceded
WKH? ÀUVW? /DWH? 3UHKLVWRULF? DUURZ? SRLQW? W\SHV? DQG?
may have overlapped temporally with them. By
the end of the Transitional Archaic, the bow and
arrow technologies were introduced across South
and Central Texas, probably around A.D. 700.
In looking back, Johnson and Goode (1994:17)
later noted that the label Transitional Archaic was
originally adopted in 1962 on the advice of Dee
Ann Story in an effort to draw correlations with
developments in the Eastern Woodlands. For some
reason, perhaps because of the connotations with
developments to the east, Johnson quickly dropped
the term (note for example the lack of it in his 1964
work), never using it again. Since its introduction,
the Transitional Archaic designation has been
carried on by a few, but overall has failed to be
universally accepted by researchers.
From the mid-1960s to mid-1970s, several

regional sequence on the eastern margin of the Edwards Plateau. Numerous sites investigated in the
San Gabriel River valley and thereabouts yielded a
substantial amount of data, and multiple competing
chronologies developed in a small area. Figure 6,
drawn from Bond’s (1978) Hoxie Bridge report,
shows the juxtaposition of several of these efforts,
revealing the variation in nomenclature, as well as
the continued use of the Transitional Archaic in one
of the works. On the heels of these chronologies,

of the Archaic using named phases, two of which
(Clear Fork and Round Rock) derive directly from
J. Charles Kelley’s earlier foci. His rationale for
using names rather than numbers, as Sorrow et al.
(1967) had done for Stillhouse Hollow, was that
divisions could be added or dropped as warranted
without a need for incessant re-numbering.
Spurred by the need to synthesize the various
efforts from a fairly small geographical area, Prewitt’s (1981) chronology (Figure 7) is notable in
one primary regard. It is one of the only systematic

hunter-gatherer pattern continued. In Central Texas,
neither the Toyah nor Austin phase groups adopted
an agricultural economic basis. Accordingly, Prewitt, in directly addressing the issue of long-term
developmental change, saw continuity between the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric, but otherwise did not
clearly address the notion of a transition.
Black (1989) used the Terminal Archaic designation to cover Weir’s (1976a, 1976b) Twin
Sisters phase, which Prewitt had further subdivided
into Driftwood and Twin Sisters. Black’s division
between the Late and Terminal Archaic followed
Weir’s divisions, with the former stylistically distinguished by the broad-bladed dart point forms
(such as Montell, Castroville, and Lange) and the
latter by the smaller sorts such as Ensor, Frio, Fairland, and Darl. One thing Black (1989:30) drew a
bead on was the differing opinions regarding events
from A.D. 300 to 800. On one side, some (such as
Weir) saw it as a period of a return to high mobility,
cessation of burned rock midden formation, and a
lack of bison. Others (such as Peter et al. [1982a]
and Skelton [1977]), conversely, viewed it as a

this larger perspective, he saw a gradual low-key

Before launching into comparisons, a few
caveats and considerations need mention. Our
chronological data are in conventional radiocarbon years before present, which are corrected
for carbon isotope ratios but are not calibrated or
converted to calendrical dates. Collins’s data are
likewise in conventional dates. Prewitt (1985:202)
presents each date “as the assay date and range
VWDWHG?LQ?UDGLRFDUERQ?\HDUV«? \HDUV?EHIRUH?SUHVHQW?? FRUUHFWHG? WR?$?'?? ???? ?µ? ZKLFK? ZH? WDNH? WR?
mean conventional dates. Black (1989), Johnson
(1995), Johnson and Goode (1994), and Turner et
al. (2011) all apparently use calibrated dates. On
the timeframe of concern (2600 to 900 B.P. or so),
the deviation between calibrated and uncalibrated
dates is not typically substantial. There was a time
when labs did not take readings on the isotope
ratios, and so no corrections can be made on dates
run in earlier studies. Nevertheless, for the sake
of direct comparison, all schemes will be placed
on a like scale, in radiocarbon years before present. To do so, calibrated dates are converted back,
following Prewitt’s (1981) simple conversions for
comparative sake, by simply subtracting the dates
from A.D. 1950 to get years before present. The
method imposes some inaccuracy but provides
estimates within a reasonable margin of error for
the times of concern here.
One further consideration is that the schemes
are not directly comparable since each is dealLQJ?ZLWK?GLIIHUHQW?WKLQJV??VFDOHV??RU?FODVVLÀFDWRU\?

units. Some are phases, some are strictly eras, or
periods, or stages, or stylistic intervals. Regardless,
if limited to the appropriate scale or data category,
meaningful comparisons can be drawn for each.

this as the end of the Archaic and the advent
of the Late Prehistoric, while Johnson indicates the Post-Archaic perhaps began earlier
with smaller dart points. Siren site dates concur with 1250 B.P. as the earliest extreme of
the break, although most of the Austin phase
dates are between 1100-900 B.P.

a stylistic interval break here, but only two
show this to be a major cultural-historical
break. The Siren data concur with the existence of a stylistic break at this time, but
entirely disagrees with most on which styles
are ending and beginning. Collins, Black, and
Prewitt place Ensor, Frio, and Fairland points
after this time, whereas the Siren site, Johnson
and Goode, and Turner et al. show them prior
to this time, although the two chronologies
also extend them beyond 1800 B.P. as well.

interval break at this time, and Prewitt and
Turner et al. show the time to be a culturalhistorical division. The Siren site data concurs
with the stylistic break, notably the advent
of Castroville points, but dates them slightly
earlier. The earliest range (back to 2300 B.P.)
is expected to be too early considering the old
wood problem. A series of comparative dates
on the Siren site between short-lived species,
such as annual lily bulbs, and wood charcoal
from the same feature, showed wood dates

2150-2050 B.P., a division not shown elsewhere,
although somewhat consistent with Turner et al.’s
dating of the three point types as beginning around
200 B.C. Johnson and Goode (1994:38) noted that
the time from 200 B.C. to A.D. 500 is a major
cultural-historical division in the eastern United
States, but they did not explicitly translate that
timeframe into the Central Texas record.
For the most part, the Siren site data concur
with most of the regional chronologies until about
2000 B.P. Major discrepancies appear among the
various chronologies and with the Siren site data
until about 1250 B.P., when the various efforts
come back into sync. In Prewitt’s chronology,
which carries over into Collins’s work, the end of
the Uvalde, Twin Sisters, and Driftwood phases
are key to unraveling the problems. Since Prewitt’s

Convenience, authority, and tradition rather
than strength of evidence are in large part
responsible for the widespread acceptance
of the conventional factor (Pribyl 2010:75).

The chronological placement of the Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases has long been criticized

archeological materials. However, until a systematic analysis determines where the problems lie and
presents a more viable alternative, the prevailing
scheme has served as the default position. The
Siren site data do not entirely resolve the issue,
but when tied into regional data and past critiques,
they point towards a resolution. The Siren data
substantially disagree with the timing of the Twin
Sisters and Driftwood phase assemblages, and the
ending of the Uvalde phase. We hypothesize that
the gap in the Siren site’s chronological record,
which was previously unseen in the Central Texas
archeological record, almost entirely accounts for
the discrepancies. Before turning to that, the problems with the timing of these critical phases need
to be addressed.
More than one author has highly commended
Prewitt on his efforts right before raking him over

the coals (e.g., Johnson 1987; Ellis 1994:47). In
honor of that well-trod tradition, we will do the
same. The intent here is not just to tear down,
but rather to build upon the more valid aspects
of Prewitt’s efforts. The reason folks keep coming back to Prewitt’s chronology is that he hit a
resonant chord—he synthesized the archeological
evidence from technology to mortuary practices
to economic evidence to compile assemblages at
a fairly precise chronological interval. He outran
the data, and the theory, perhaps, and has been
criticized for it. In moving forward, there are valid
critiques that are worth drawing to the forefront,
but there are also substantial accomplishments
worth retaining as foundations on which to build.
Before returning to foundations, we have to turn a

noted that of the 147 dates that Prewitt relied upon,

phase mixed components, two from DriftwoodTwin Sisters phase mixed components, and two
dates from contexts lacking Driftwood phase
components (Table 3; Young n.d.). Because of the
lack of clear associations, none of the dates can be
clearly associated with the Driftwood phase assemblage. Two dates (Tx-3404 and Tx-2731, as listed
in Table 3) attributed to the Twin Sisters phase are
from components that contain Darl points but not
Ensor points or other Twin Sisters phase diagnostic
artifacts. If the two dates of 1640 B.P. (Tx-3404)
and 1740 B.P. (Tx-2731) are the closest there is to a

highly consistent with the dates from Component

There is additional evidence that suggests
the Driftwood phase may have been a longer
lived phase than thought, beginning much earlier than the 1400 B.P. start dates depicted by

119

Prewitt (1981, 1985) and Collins (1995, 2004),
but consistent with Turner et al.’s (2011) placement. Prewitt (1985:217), using the ratio of
components to the duration of the phase in years,
inferred a stunning population explosion during
the Driftwood phase. Driftwood, according to his
formulation, is the shortest lived at 150 years, and
so the 63 components attributable to the phase
yielded a relative population density nearly twice
any other in prehistory. Although he urged caution in relying too heavily upon the data, such a
dramatic increase during this short time makes
no sense in light of all other lines of evidence,
including subsistence, site distribution patterns,
socio-economic context, mortuary, supporting
paleoenvironmental evidence, or otherwise. There
is no evidence of an economic engine (agriculture,
for example) for population increase during the
time, nor expected changes in residential mobility. Some authors have suggested a widespread
collapse of the macroeconomic sphere during
this time (Carpenter and Hartnett 2011; Hall
1981). The problem, we surmise, is an unduly
short phase that should be 500 years long rather
than 150. Recalculating based on that estimate
would place the Driftwood population in alignment with the following Austin phase, and much
more consistent with expectations derived from
the archeological record.

Further evidence of the relatively longer
duration of the Driftwood phase comes from several
sources. On the early side, as previously noted, the
purest dated components associated with the phase
assemblage date to as early as 1750 B.P., and these
dates are supported by the Siren site dates, but also
perhaps those from the Cowdog Crossing site in
Fort Hood (Carpenter et al. 2010). While not clearly
suggestive of an early date in and of itself, the
overlap of Ensor and Darl is seen in a burial from
Mather Farm (41WM7), which had a Darl point
embedded in the skull and an Ensor point between
the second and third ribs (Prewitt 1982:47).
On the later end of the temporal spectrum for
Darl points, Suhm and Jelks (1962:179) originally placed the points as extending to A.D. 1000
(roughly 950 B.P.), and other studies, such as at
McKinney Roughs (Carpenter et al. 2006) and a
site in Young County (Quigg et al. 2011), have
likewise suggested the perpetuation of the style
interval into relatively late times. On the eastern
side of the Siren site, a Darl point was recovered in
possible association with dates of about 1050 B.P.,
but the association in not entirely clear.
Overall, the Siren site data are not strong, but
what are there suggests an earlier advent for the
Driftwood phase than some chronologies allow.
More importantly, the timing of the Driftwood

social interaction with the eastern United States as
a possible source for these new point types. These
projectiles may have been part of a package of new
cultural items related to the spreading of Eastern
Woodland religious ideas as far as the Edwards Plateau: these included the exotic items noted above
such as marine shells and atlatl weights (Johnson
and Goode 1994:37).
Young’s (n.d.) analyses of the Twin Sisters
phase dates are likewise rather critical. The dates
include four unprovenienced or unpublished dates,
none from pure components, eight from mixed
Twin Sisters and Driftwood components, two from

Twin Sisters and Uvalde mixed components, and

phase diagnostics (Table 4; Young n.d:4). With the
publication of the Anthon site report (Goode 2002),
however, two of the previously unpublished dates
are now available for scrutiny. The one seemingly
pure date comes from Stratum 4, Feature 31 at the
Loeve-Fox site, but was assigned to the preceding
Uvalde phase (Table 5). This date of 1960 B.P. (Tx???? ?FDPH?IURP?D?VWUDWXP?ZLWK?ÀYH?(QVRU?SRLQWV?
and one dart point fragment. Such a date is highly
consistent with the Siren site’s Component 3, dated
to ca. 1900-2000 B.P. This Loeve-Fox date has a
210-year standard deviation, which raises concerns
regarding the date’s utility. However, it is worth
noting that the closest thing to a pure Twin Sisters
phase component has a standard deviation that falls
entirely outside of his 1400 to 1750 date range for
Ensor points and the Twin Sisters phase.
Turner et al. (2011) place the major Twin Sisters
diagnostic styles (Ensor, Frio, and Fairland) from
A.D. 200-600 (1350-1750 B.P.), and Johnson and
Goode (1994) indicate a similar range. The Siren site
data show a narrower temporal range, but the shorter

portion of the abovementioned works, the Component 3 dates entirely contradict Prewitt (1981,
1985), Collins (1995, 2004), and Black (1989). The
temporal ranges of the stylistic intervals are mutually exclusive. Instead, the Siren site data, which
are robust from this component, strongly indicate
the major hallmarks of this phase were in place
centuries before the 1800 B.P. date asserted by some
temporal frameworks. The Siren site indicates the
termination of the phase by 1800 to 1750 B.P., but
the lack of data on one site cannot be cited as proof
positive that the phase did not continue beyond those
dates elsewhere. For example, the previously mentioned Mather Farm burial, which contained both a
Darl and Ensor point embedded in the skeleton, is
compelling evidence for an overlap in at least the
stylistic intervals. The duration of the overlap is yet
to be determined.

Once the major temporal adjustment to the
Driftwood phase is made, and the Twin Sisters
is accordingly pushed back, the earlier preceding
phases begin to align fairly well with the Siren site
record, although slight revisions towards greater
antiquity are needed. The Uvalde phase marked by
Castroville, Marcos, and Montell points, according
to the Siren site dates, fall around 2200-2300 B.P.,
rather than 1800-2250 B.P. as Prewitt (1985:215)

less concurs on all fronts (temporally and artifact
assemblage-wise) with the Siren site Component

component and would not stand the stringent criteria used to break down Prewitt’s strata and components. So why does the Siren site offer any greater
resolution? Because the Siren site chronology is
based on the site’s structural components, notably
IHDWXUHV??UDWKHU?WKDQ?GLDJQRVWLF?DUWLIDFWV??7KH?ÀQH?
art of drawing associations between radiocarbon
dates and artifacts is always an interpretive process
since artifacts are more conducive to movement
than burned rock features. The often palimpsestlike nature of the Central Texas archeological
UHFRUG? PDNHV? LW? HYHQ? PRUH? GLIÀFXOW?? 1RQH? RI? WKH?
sites that form the basis for the 1981 chronology
have published detailed analyses of site structure.
Accordingly, there is no recourse but to critique the
associations of dates and diagnostics in the sites

used in past chronology building. The distribution
of artifacts should not be the sole, or even primary,
criteria of integrity. Reanalysis of those important
sites from the past may well prove their validity in
chronological matters despite intermixed diagnostic artifacts.
3UHZLWW·V?$FFRPSOLVKPHQWV
Prewitt’s chronological breaks are largely
supported by the Siren site data. As has long been
pointed out, there is a mismatch between the archeological content of several critical phases. If
WKHVH?DUH?UHFWLÀHG??DOO?RI?WKH?YDULRXV?FKURQRORJLHV?
fall into alignment, and, of them all, only Prewitt’s
chronology provides a detailed, assemblage-based
cultural chronology for Central Texas. Many of
the particulars in the assemblages need to be reassessed in light of much new data that have emerged
since his analyses, but the major components seem
to hold up to scrutiny.
As Childe (1956:121) stated, “a culture is not

that included all archeological classes, as well as
behavioral ones. On many occasions, his work
has been a lightning rod. For reasons previously
discussed, Johnson’s critique that phases were

descriptive and the interpretive ought to remain
distinct: there needs to be an archeological unit that
classes together similar components from different
sites within a region. Regarding another general
critique, the assertion that Prewitt’s chronology
is fundamentally a stylistic interval sequence of
projectile points is likewise unfounded. Few if any
other Central Texas chronologies are so completely
assemblage-based.
7KH?,QDELOLW\?WR?6HH?:KDW?LV?1RW?7KHUH
Minds and models typically look at data, not the
gaps between the data. Few projects in the past have
been afforded such a sweeping suite of radiocarbon
samples from a continuously aggrading site. Without this vantage point afforded by the Siren site, in
cobbling together the radiocarbon data in a highly
piecemeal fashion from widely disparate sites, any
gaps can be attributed to the narrow segments of the
overall strand that each site provides. A complete

and other limitations in the archeological record.
But, with the donut that is the Siren site, the hole
becomes readily apparent, and just maybe the hole
offers insights into the whole. The chronological
gap from about 1250-1750 B.P. on the Siren site
raises important questions that can be answered by
other sites. The Siren site yielded 72 Ensor points
and three Darl points. The Loeve-Fox site yielded
57 Darl points and 18 Ensor points (Prewitt’s
1982:74-78 Variant I; his Variant II equates to this
article’s Fairland points). Clearly, what is poorly
represented on one site is well represented on the
other. By matching the two, there are somewhat
complementary patterns. Five of the 10 Loeve-Fox
radiocarbon dates reported by Prewitt (1982:18) date
IURP???????????%?3???ÀOOLQJ?LQ?WKH?JDS?IURP??????
1250 B.P. on the Siren site. The remaining dates
reported by Prewitt include four that fall within a
Late Prehistoric timeframe from 850-1080 B.P., and
one date of 2100 B.P., which was discarded because
of an 880-year standard deviation range that eclipsed
DQ\?FRQÀGHQFH?LQ?LWV?DFFXUDF\??
Accordingly, gaps, if well-bounded, equally
contribute to the data. The Siren and Loeve-Fox

123

sites provide highly complementary perspectives
on the overall chronology. The Loeve-Fox site
captures only a relatively small portion of the Twin
Sisters phase, and likely reveals a more extensive
Driftwood component than previously envisioned.

SUMMARY
To assume what is true of one site is applicable
to all would only contribute to the further discord.
Assemblages may have much greater time depth
in some areas, but only brief durations elsewhere.
However, it is a valid analytical tack to use siteVSHFLÀF?GDWD?WR?WHVW?JHQHUDOL]HG?PRGHOV??7KH?UHVXOWV?

revised to encompass the variation of observed data.
Accordingly, the Siren site supports a growing
consensus of major chronological breaks at 2600–
2500 B.P.; 2300–2250 B.P.; 1800–1750 B.P.; and
1250–1100 B.P. (Figure 11). Given the old wood
problem mentioned above, it appears the younger
end of these ranges is likely the more accurate. In
addition to these major partitions, the Siren site
UHYHDOV?ÀQHU?VXEGLYLVLRQV??EXW?WKRVH?OLVWHG?DUH?WKH?
more widely recognized ones found in most, but
not all, models. Despite emergent consensus on
the timing of major changes, the various existing chronologies have widely varying notions on
which assemblages and stylistic intervals are associated with these major chronological breaks. The
Siren site shows Ensor, Frio, and Fairland points
from about 2100-1900 B.P., a timeframe within the
ranges presented by Turner et al. (2011) and Johnson and Goode (1994), but entirely contradictory
to all other chronologies. Castroville points, possibly contemporaneous with Montell points, occur
within a relatively discrete component on the Siren
site that dates to between 2300-2100 B.P., a timeframe consistent with the early temporal range proposed by Collins (2004) and Prewitt (1981, 1985).
The dates for the Edwards and Scallorn points on
the Siren site range from 1100-900 B.P., which is
consistent with almost all models. Perhaps the most
intriguing aspect of the Siren site is a prominent
half-millennium gap in the chronological record
from 1750-1250 B.P. This occupational absence,
when considered within the context of the regional
record, is a keystone in a revised regional chronology. Because of low archeological visibility, the

timeframe is perhaps an underestimated portion
of the regional chronology. If the time that Prewitt

phases and stylistic intervals, the Siren site data
fall into full accord with Prewitt’s and Collins’s

the harsh glare of scrutiny. In an informal poll of
Central Texas archeologists conducted by one of
the authors, there seems to be a common view that
the phase concept is dead, irretrievably damaged.

subdivisions in the archeological record.
Johnson’s (1987) critique appears to have
substantially contributed to the demise of phases.
However, he created untenable criteria. By linking
phases necessarily to social processes, he created
interpretive categories rather than descriptive archeological categories. The theoretical architecture to operationalize his criteria, to bridge the
interpretive gap, and to show precisely how social
processes become manifest in the Central Texas
archeological record given all its problems, is not
in place at this time.
If we look to the long debate among archeologists in the eastern United States, arguably the theoUHWLFDO?ODERUDWRU\?LQ?WKH?GHYHORSPHQW?RI?FODVVLÀFDtory units such as phases, among the harshest critics

A cache of 11 chipped stone bifaces was found at the Bateman Site (41SM443), located at a spring in north

bifaces; two other artifacts, another biface and a dart point base, found at the site are also described. The raw
material represented in the cache includes quartzite, orthoquartzite, and siltstone, and their source is probably
southern and southeast Oklahoma. The date of the cache is unknown, but the forms suggest possibly Archaic or
Woodland period. The cache is compared to the Woodland period Tuinier biface cache (41HP237) in order to
measure the differences between the two caches. A statistical comparison between the Bateman cache and the
Woodland period Tuinier biface cache (41HP237) is presented, along with discussions regarding technology,
raw material, and behavioral processes that moved the Bateman bifaces from the point of origin to this site.

The Bateman biface cache of 11 bifaces was
discovered near a spring in Smith County in eastern
Texas (Figure 1) by members of the Bateman family during mechanical earthmoving on their property. Mr. Bateman contacted Walters, a member of
the Texas Archeological Stewardship Network and
6PLWK? &RXQW\? UHVLGHQW?? DERXW? WKH? ÀQG? LQ? WKH? ODWH?
spring of 2011 and graciously loaned the artifacts
to Walters and Shafer for analysis. Walters recorded the spring area as the Bateman Site (41SM443).
The purpose of the article is to fully describe
the bifaces and identify the source of the orthoquartzite and quartzite raw material. The chronological age of the cache is unknown but given the
preference for orthoquartzite and quartzite, a Late
Archaic or Woodland period date is most likely.
Biface caches of orthoquartzite are rare in east
Texas although it is the preferred material for Late
Archaic and Woodland period dart points (Johnson
1962; McGregor 1987; Perttula 1999; Shafer and
Green 2008). The only other cache of orthoquartzite bifaces currently described is the Tuinier cache
(Shafer and Green 2008) in Hopkins County (see
Figure 1). The two caches are compared statistically to test for similarity and consistency in
form. Why the selection of orthoquartzite over

Woodford chert, or Edwards chert is a question that
is explored along with possible reasons for caching
the material.

Artifact caches are relatively rare in east Texas
and consist mostly of partially reduced bifaces of
either Edwards chert from central Texas or siliceous stone from the western Ouachita range of
southeastern Oklahoma (Newell and Krieger 1949:
176, 177, Fig. 25J; Shafer 1973:235-237; Shafer
and Green 2008; Shafer and Walters 2012; Tomka
and Fields 1990). East Texas is not known for good
quality siliceous stone such as larger cobbles of

of these materials were acquired through direct
procurement or exchange from sources in central
Texas (Shafer 1973:262; Shafer 2005; Shafer and
Walters 2010; Tomka and Fields 1990), Oklahoma
(Banks and Winter 1975:32-37; Shafer and Walters
2011), or Arkansas (Shafer 1973: 262).
One other cache recently reported from east
Texas, is the Tuinier Cache (Shafer and Green
2008) which consisted of 28 orthoquartzite bifaces,

that they were probably intended for different

The transportation of partly reduced bifaces
from the Edwards chert source area was not uncommon as numerous examples are known in Texas
(Miller 2007). Surprisingly, however, little is known
of the transport and caching of partly reduced artifacts from sources in Oklahoma. The only other
reported cache of Ouachita Mountain, material in
east Texas is the Jensen biface cache from Henderson County made of Woodford chert from the Johns
Valley shale (Shafer and Walters 2011).

The Bateman family resides on property in

a punch. Some pressure retouch is evident to more

edges were abraded on seven specimens to strengthen the platform for the punch. Closer inspection may

have reddish, reddish-brown or reddish tan hues
indicating an iron rich matrix. The distinction
between the types of the quartzite and siltstone
depends upon subjective evaluations of coarseness. The quartzite specimen is the coarsest; the
orthoquartzite ones are less so, and the siltstone is
WKH?ÀQHU?PDWHULDO?WKDW?ERUGHUV?RQ?FKHUW?OLNH?TXDOity. The parent source of these rocks is probably
from the Ogallala formation south of the Arbuckle
Mountains in south-central Oklahoma (Don Wyckoff, personal communication 2011).
A close inspection was made of each of the 11
specimen to see if traces of the original character
of the raw material such as cobbles or slab could
be ascertained. Specimens A and B exhibit rough
crenulated surfaces possibly due to the mass cleavage
of parent outcrop. Close-ups of these surfaces on
specimens A and B are shown in Figure 5. The unÁDNHG? VXUIDFH? RQ? VSHFLPHQ? %? ZDV? ÀUVW? WKRXJKW? WR?

on these artifacts are possibly the rough surface of
an exfoliated slab of orthoquartzite. Specimen K
has cortex on the base and a crenulated surface on
one face. This artifact was perhaps reduced from a
split cobble. Three other bifaces have cortex bases
(Figure3D-E, J; Figure 4D-E, J) indicating that
these were reduced from weathered cobbles, some
exceeding 10 cm in maximum dimension.

bifaces suggest they are Gary preforms, and probably date to the Woodland period from about A.D.
1 to 500-600. Since biface caches are rare in east
Texas, the Bateman and Tuinier caches are compared for information with regards to possible age
and preform characteristics.

Figure 7. Selected examples from the Tuinier biface cache.

There are clear similarities in raw material
an overall shape within the Tuinier cache as seen
in Table 4. While the Tuinier specimens are a bit
shorter than the Bateman specimens, they are wider,
thicker, and less variable in length and thickness.
T-tests comparing the two samples in terms of
length, width and thickness indicates that width

length is not (p<.05). Another difference between
the two samples is the correlations among length,
width, and thickness (Table 5). Only the correlation

Shafer and Green (2008) mention the thickness of

orthoquartzite. The size and shape as well as the
hardness of the raw material may explain why the
specimens have a very consistent thickness that
does not vary with overall size (length and width).
Figures 9A and B show that the Bateman specimens are comparable in length, but narrower and

thinner than those from Tuinier. Figure 10 shows
the discriminant function that best separates the
bifaces from each cache. The separation is comSOHWH?DQG?UHFODVVLÀFDWLRQ?RI?WKH?ELIDFHV?LQWR?WKH?WZR?
groups results in no errors.
The statistical separation of the two caches
could indicate that the ultimate linear reduction trajectory of the two was different. The raw material
size was certainly different and this selection could
have affected the manufacturing trajectory. The
Tuinier cache made of large orthoquartzite pebbles
or small cobbles (ranging in size from 53 to 75
mm with an average of 64 mm ) was interpreted
as Gary point preforms based on their morphology
(Shafer and Green 2008). The morphology of the
Bateman cache bifaces made from larger cobbles
or slabs (ranging in size from 51 to 83 mm with

The variation in the morphology suggests that the
linear trajectory of these bifaces toward a preform
shape also was different.

1999:11). Banks (1990:56, 57) traces the source of
orthoquartzite in east Texas to the Uvalde Gravels,
whose ultimate origin is the Ogallala Formation
(Banks 1990; Cliff and Peter 1996: 6). The most
common siliceous material in these gravels is

present (McGregor 1987).
Regardless of the distant proximity of excellent
siliceous material, the preference for orthoquartzite
for the production of Late Archaic and Woodland
Period projectile points such as Gary points is
well documented across east Texas (Johnson
1962; McGregor 1987; Perttula 1999; Shafer and
Green 2008). Johnson (1962) referred to the orthoquartzite from the Yarbrough site as “reddish-gray

the typical orthoquartzite found across east Texas.
The origin of the orthoquartzite pebbles and
small cobbles in the Tuinier cache is most likely
Uvalde Gravels since traces of cobble cortex is
evident on some of the specimens. The preference
for orthoquartzite from these ancient gravels over efforts to acquire better material from the sources listed above may be due to restricted social boundaries
or technological preference. The Late Archaic and
Woodland stone workers had a system for working
the material that achieved success. Orthoquartzite

using the conventional direct soft-hammer (billet)
method (Peter and McGregor 1987:201-209).
Analyses of lithic assemblages from east Texas
have lead some archaeologists to speculate that an
alternative method of indirect rather than direct
percussion was used to manufacture Gary and other
dart points from orthoquartzite (J.E. Dockall, personal information 2011; Shafer and Green 2008).
The impact points on orthoquartzite bifaces in both
caches are narrow and deep rather than broad and
deep as with a hard hammer, or broad and shallow
as with a billet. Also, as noted by Shafer and Green
(2008) the small mass of orthoquartzite cobbles is
QRW?FRQGXFLYH?WR?KDUG?KDPPHU?ÁDNLQJ?EHFDXVH?RI?
the energy absorption when supported in the hand
(see also Peter and McGregor 1987). Indirect percussion employs a punch which is placed directly
on the striking platform and struck with a hammer
of stone or some other available material (Shafer
2005; Whittaker 1994:33).

&$&+,1*?%(+$9,25
A great deal of literature has been written over
the past two decades describing and providing explanations for lithic caches. The Clovis period has
especially received attention (see Kilby 2008 for an
excellent overview of Clovis cache studies). Studies of Archaic and Late Prehistoric hunter-gatherer
cache behavior are less well represented. Collins
(1999:73-177), Galan (2007), Miller (2007), Shafer
and Green (2008), and Tunnell (1978) have addressed PaleoIndian, Archaic, or Late Prehistoric
caches in Texas and have provided possible explanations for the behavior.
Caching may be explained by a number of behavioral actions; caching for later reduction or use;
moving into a landscape where one is unfamiliar with
the lithic resources; insurance; dedicatory; trade and
exchange; and votive offerings (Galan 2007:55-66).
Galan, in his analysis of the Hegar (41HR1030)
cache, provides an excellent discussion regarding
different caching strategies. He lists and discusses
several options: provisioning a place for future need;
banking insurance caching; trade caching; and ritual
caching; some archaeologists see caching as a way
of minimizing stress in hunter-gatherer foraging behavior (Gerber et al. 2003:83; Torrance 1983). Galan

141

(2007:58), citing Gerber et al.(2003:83) states that
“caching becomes optimal with the abundance of
UHVRXUFHV?GHFOLQH?DQG?WKH?YDOXH?LQFUHDVHV?RYHU?WLPH?µ?
It is one way of leveling the landscape for hunters
DQG?JDWKHUHUV?E\?VWRULQJ?LWHPV?LQ?UHVRXUFH?GHÀFLHQW?
areas for future retrieval if needed.
Caches deposited for anticipated trade also
may be indicative of territorial boundaries (Button
1989: 216; Galan 2007:62; Miller 1993:13-14).
Ritual caches deposited as offerings to provision
the dead are not common in Texas in the Archaic
Period but do occur in the Edwards Plateau (Bement 1994:67-70, 112, 129) and South Texas
Coastal Plain (Taylor 1995). Galan (2007:55)

to prove (with the exception of mortuary associations), but listing them may provide insight into
the possible strategies that came into play when
depositing but not retrieving the cache. Why the
Bateman cache was left by the spring is unknown,
but we can speculate that it was either because the
spring was a landmark and the cache would be easily retrieved for one or more of the reasons listed
above, or alternatively, it was left as a dedicatory
cache to the spirits of the spring itself.
One observation that deserves mentioning and
is pertinent to interpreting caching behavior is the
geographical setting of East Texas. East Texas is
surrounded on the northeast, north, and west by
UHJLRQV?ZLWK?H[FHOOHQW?TXDOLW\?WRROVWRQH??DQG?UHÁHFWV?
a consumer area and not a production area with
regards to high quality lithic resources (Shafer and
Walters 2010). Imported material for chipped stone
and celts are recycled to exhaustion in Woodland

that are too small for further use. This producerFRQVXPHU?SDWWHUQ?ZDV?QRWHG?LQ?RWKHU?OLWKLF?GHÀFLHQW?
areas adjacent to regions that have high quality stone
such as northern Belize (Dockall and Shafer 1993)
and the Tularosa Basin in far west Texas (Shafer et

reduction sequence for dart points. The bifaces are
of suitable size to have served as preforms for dart
points. The Bateman cache was compared quantitatively to the Woodland period Tuinier cache in
nearby Hopkins County (Shafer and Green 2008).
The sources of the raw materials are different. Statistically, the differences in size and form hint that
the two caches may not be the same chronologiFDO?DJH?DQG?WKH?ÀQDO?WRRO?IRUP?PD\?KDYH?GLIIHUHG??
Studer (1982) describes a proposed reduction
sequence for Gary points from the Icy Eye site in
Harrison County and illustrate a series of performs
that compare closely to the stage of reduction represented by the Tuinier cache bifaces (Shafer and
Green 2008). The Bateman cache bifaces do not
compare as well to the Icy Eye examples presented
by Studer in that some are sub-triangular rather that
lozenge-shaped as are the Tuinier specimens. These
differences are subtle, however, and the intended
trajectory of the Bateman specimens is unknown.
The stage of reduction in biface caches is
informative. Biface manufacture is a system that
SURJUHVVHV? ZLWK? WKH? UHPRYDO? RI? HDFK? ÁDNH?? 6RPH?
reduction often occurs at the quarry source to reduce the mass for transport to the next site of operation. Bifaces are further reduced by shaping and
thinning to a blank stage, at which point they may

recipient of the bifaces (Shafer 1993). This linear,
or evolutionary, process was aptly illustrated by
W. H. Holmes (1894). The linear reduction system
has been applied to east Texas lithics (Girard 1995;
Shafer 1973:73-82; Studer 1982) and is useful to
help place bifaces in caches in a systemic context.
Additional information is gained by tracing the material from the point of origin to the site in which
it was found. In the case of the Bateman cache, the
size of the parent raw material indicates that it did
not come from Smith County, but more likely was
transported from natural outcrops in south-central
Oklahoma south of the Arbuckle Mountains according to Don Wyckoff (personal communication
2011) (see Figure 2).
The act of moving material from a resource
DUHD?WR?RQH?WKDW?LV?GHÀFLHQW?LQ?JRRG?UDZ?PDWHULDO?
would most likely be part of an economic trade/exchange system. How did the material end up at the
Bateman site and what behavioral processes were
involved in the partial reduction and movement of

the bifaces? The possible cultural behaviors that
led to the deposit of the Bateman bifaces near the
spring are numerous. First, the formation of the
cache could simply be a product of direct procurePHQW?ZKHUH?WKH?ÁLQWNQDSSHU?WUDYHOHG?WR?WKH?VRXUFH?
outcrops to get the material and partly reduce it for
transportation. Second, a trader could have partly
reduced the material and exchanged it with one or
more recipients. Third, a down-the-line recipient in
the latter case could have cached the material near
the spring for later recovery and use (Miller 2007:
9-12). Fourth, the cache could also have been left
as a ritual deposit. We do not know which, or if
DQ\??RI?WKHVH?EHKDYLRUV?ZHUH?LQYROYHG?LQ?WKH?ÀQDO?
disposition of the cache, but the third possibility is
the most plausible.

&21&/86,216
Biface caches are not common in East Texas
although several have been reported. The one that
compares most closely to the Bateman cache is the
Tuinier cache (Shafer and Green 2008). These two
caches are compared to illustrate their differences
and similarities. Shafer and Green (2008) have suggested that the Tuinier cache was part of a linear
reduction system geared toward the manufacture
of Gary points. The Bateman cache, however, is
quantitatively different and we speculate that the
IRUP?RI?WKH?ÀQDO?LQWHQGHG?SURGXFW?PD\?KDYH?EHHQ?
different as well. Walters has observed Caddo ceramics at the site, but it is possible that a Woodland
or Late Archaic component may be near the spring
as well based on the presence of the contracting
stem dart point.
We do not know the chronological age of the
cache and are unsure as to which economic process or processes governed the movement of raw
materials at the time these Bateman bifaces were
manufactured and transported. The parent outcrop
was most likely the Ogallala formation in southcentral Oklahoma for the cache specimens. The
bifaces could have been transported to the Bateman
site by a number of different behavioral means.

The Texas Archeological Society (TAS) conducted data recovery excavations at the Oblate
site (41CM1) in Comal County, Texas, in June and
July 1963 (Figure 1). Currently the site is located
on the southern bank of Canyon Lake, which was
formed when Canyon Dam was constructed on
the Guadalupe River near San Marcos, Texas.
This project, however, was undertaken before
Canyon Lake was filled. Prior to the filling of the
reservoir, the site was located “along the east bank

Guadalupe River about 400-750 ft. downstream
of the site (Johnson et al. 1962:80). The Oblate
site is 900 ft. above mean sea level, and about 80
ft. above the Guadalupe River’s original channel.
The spring-fed creek was located within a limestone canyon. A broad, alluvial terrace slopes 160
ft. up from the creek bed to the base of a limestone cliff. At the base of this cliff, a limestone
overhang forms a shelter cave that houses a large
portion of the site. Overbank and flood deposits
created the sloping alluvial terrace and filled the
rock shelter with sediments from the Guadalupe
River beginning in the Late Archaic and continuing until Historic times. Terrace deposits are up
to 9 ft. deep.

In 1959 and 1960, Texas Archeological
Salvage Project (TASP) excavations at the same
site recovered data that resulted in a relative
chronological sequence for the Central Texas
Late Archaic that was the basis for a then-current
consensus chronology (Johnson et al. 1962). The
primary motivation for the 1963 excavations was
to provide a backdrop for the film “Salvaging

hand-excavated units. Six of the units were excavated within or immediately adjacent to the shelter.
In addition, four units were excavated in the terrace
between the shelter overhang and the creek.

Michael B. Collins, then a student at The
University of Texas at Austin, started a report on
the excavations for a class with Professor E. Mott
Davis. Unfortunately, the class was over before
the report was complete. Collins, however, did
complete a draft of the artifact analysis but never
completed the discussion and site analysis sections
(Collins 1966). The following discussion, therefore, provides a summary, description, and analysis
of the excavations in an attempt to complete the
report started in 1966.
Unfortunately, over the years, a few of the
artifacts have been lost and some have lost their
correct provenience. Discrepancies between the
inventories, bag tags, and artifact labels have been

The site is located within the Edwards Plateau
physiographic region, which is characterized by
rolling to hilly terrain with elevations ranging from
900 to 2,000 ft. above mean sea level (amsl). The
shelter at the Oblate site is located at an elevation
of about 900 ft. amsl. The surrounding area is comprised of canyon land drained by the Guadalupe
River. Currently, the site is located on the southern
bank of Canyon Lake, but at the time of the 1963
excavations, the site was located on the east bank

In the uplands, the limestone terrain is typical
of the Edwards Plateau and has oak and juniper
woodlands, with interspersed grasslands. Trees in
lower elevations and bottomlands include sycamore, elm, basswood, pecan, walnut, persimmon,
willow, and hackberry (Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department 2011). The site lies within Blair’s
(1950) Balconian biotic province; he lists 57 species of mammals, 16 lizards, 36 snakes, one land
turtle, and 22 amphibians. Wildlife commonly observed in the area today include white-tailed deer,
badger, fox, raccoon, skunk, armadillo, squirrel,

The underlying geologic formation of the site
area is the Lower Cretaceous Glen Rose formation, which is exposed at higher elevations within
the tributary channel, and possibly the Cow Creek
formation. The Glen Rose formation is characterized by alternating resistant and recessive beds of
limestone, dolomite, and marl that form a stairstep topography (Barnes 1974). A broad alluvial
terrace sloped from the mouth of the shelter cave
to the channel of the spring-fed creek. This recent
alluvium is set into the Cretaceous limestone
canyon.

The Oblate site is in the Central Texas archeological area (Collins 1995, 2004). Prehistoric
archeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous human occupation starting around 11,500
years ago. During the prehistoric era, hunting and
gathering was the exclusive resource procurement
VWUDWHJ\?RI?&HQWUDO?7H[DQV??6LWHV?W\SLFDOO\?UHÁHFW?
relatively short-term occupations. Deeper sites
with large amounts of archeological materials are
thought to be camps that were returned to through
the years, possibly on a regular basis.

Collins (1995, 2004) authored a synthesis of
Central Texas archeology, dividing the prehistory
of Central Texas into three time periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and the Late Prehistoric. Each of
these was further divided into sub-periods, such as

WR? DV? ´VW\OH? LQWHUYDOVµ? FRLQFLGH? ZLWK? WKH? LQWHUYDO?
of use of a particular point style or group of point
styles. These style intervals can overlap or extend
over more than one sub-period. Most, however, can
be used to divide the sub-periods.

Collins’ realms concept offers a more pragmatic,

regions of Texas.

The archeological evidence (e.g., Meltzer
1993) no longer supports the long-held belief
that characterized North American Paleoindians
as nomadic bands of big game hunters. Big game
hunting did take place, particularly in Folsom
times. However, a more generalized hunting and
gathering subsistence lifeway is now evidenced at
Paleoindian sites across Texas and the rest of North
America. The relatively mesic conditions that prevailed beginning about 11,500 B.P. allowed for a
high biomass in Central Texas and the surrounding
regions (Collins 1995).
Clovis and Folsom style intervals divide Collins’ early Paleoindian period (11,200–10,000
B.P.). Clovis is the earliest recognized cultural
horizon in Central Texas. Clovis is securely dated
to between 11,200 and 10,900 B.P. in radiocarbon
years. The Wilson-Leonard, Gault, and Pavo Real
sites have recently added new data to the study
of these early peoples of what is now Texas.
Kincaid Rockshelter and Horn Shelter also have
documented Clovis components. Clovis artifacts
include prismatic blades, engraved stones, bola

stones, and the unique Clovis point (Collins 1995,
???? ??&ORYLV?SRLQWV?DUH?XVXDOO\?ODQFHRODWH?ÁXWHG?
projectile points (Collins 1998).
The Folsom style interval is not as securely
dated, and may overlap in time with Clovis. The

among the most easily recognized points made in
the Americas. In Folsom times, more than at any
other interval, people were specialized hunters.
Bison kills with associated Folsom points remain
the typical Folsom site type. The postulated style
intervals following Folsom, known as Plainview
and Dalton-San Patrice, are not well known or
FOHDUO\?GHÀQHG??DW?OHDVW?LQ?&HQWUDO?7H[DV??+RZHYHU??
evidence from sites containing related components,
such as Horn Shelter 2, indicate an Archaic-like
hunter-gatherer lifeway (Redder 1985).
Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s
Hall style intervals make up Collins’ (1995) Late
Paleoindian sub-period. This sub-period is characterized as intermediate or transitional between
Paleoindian and Archaic (Collins 1998:63–64).
Burned rock features have been found associated
with all three style intervals of this sub-period, but
they are substantially smaller and less frequent occurrences than in the Archaic (Collins 1995, 2004).
$UFKDLF? ????²?????%?3?
The mesic conditions of the Paleoindian period came to an end during the early sub-period
of the Archaic. With the exception of the BellAndice-Calf Creek interval of the Middle Archaic
sub-period, this was a more xeric time in Central
Texas and the surrounding regions. A rise in the
QXPEHU?RI?JURXQG?VWRQH?WRROV??VSHFLÀFDOO\?PDQRV?
and metates, in Archaic sites suggests an increased
reliance on plant resources (Collins 1995, 2004).
Central Texas Archaic sites are characterized by
accumulations of heat-altered rock, including those
known as burned rock middens (Black 1997).
7KUHH? VXE?SHULRGV? DUH? GHÀQHG? IRU? WKH? &HQWUDO?
Texas Archaic: Early, Middle, and Late (Johnson
and Goode 1994; Collins 1995, 2004). Early
Archaic sites (8800–6000 B.P.) are recognized by
the presence of Angostura, Early Split Stem, and
Martindale-Uvalde points. Unifacial Clear Fork
tools and Guadalupe bifaces are found in Early
Archaic sites along with ground stone tools and
other bifacial and unifacial implements. Early
Archaic earth ovens and accumulations of burned
rock are found primarily in Live Oak savanna

habitats, or those portions of the Edwards Plateau
that received the most precipitation. These earth
ovens and accumulations of burned rock are
considered the technological antecedents of the
classic burned rock middens (Collins 1995, 2004).
However, at Fort Hood seven burned rock middens
were carefully radiocarbon-dated from 5500 B.C.
(Early Archaic) to A.D. 1400 (Late Prehistoric)
(Quigg and Ellis 1994). Two other burned rock
features in Kerr County have been dated to the Early
Archaic (Luke 1980).
'XULQJ? WKH? ÀUVW? LQWHUYDO? ????²????? %?3? ? RI?
the Middle Archaic sub-period the climate was
somewhat more mesic. Bison populations soared.
The technically impressive Bell-Andice-Calf Creek
points were likely made primarily for killing these
bison (Johnson and Goode 1994). By 5000 B.P.,
the bison had dwindled and the climate became
increasingly xeric. Burned rock middens were
likely used to cook sotol and other xerophytes that
thrived during these dry years (Johnson and Goode
1994:26). The last 1,000 years of the Middle Archaic (5000–4000 B.P.) are divided into two style
intervals: Taylor and Nolan-Travis.
The Late Archaic (4000–1300 B.P.) began
during the driest time Central Texans had yet to
experience. There was, however, a steady environmental shift from xeric to mesic conditions that
peaked in the later part of the Late Archaic (Collins
1995, 2004). Bison returned with the rise of effective moisture. Six style intervals are recognized
for the Middle to Late Archaic: (1) Bulverde, (2)
Pedernales-Kinney, (3) Lange-Marshall-Williams,
(4) Marcos-Montell-Castroville, (5) Ensor-FrioFairland, and (6) Darl (Johnson and Goode 1994,
Collins 2004).

introduced during this time, but unlike many areas
in Texas and the rest of the New World, hunting
and gathering resource procurement strategies
prevailed (Collins 1995, 2004). Not surprisingly,
many documented instances of arrow wounds are
recorded during this period (Prewitt 1974).
The Late Prehistoric is divided into early and
late sub-periods (Collins 2004). Each sub-period
has a single style interval. The early sub-period
is represented by the Austin style interval and the

Wishoff and Nash—Excavations at the Oblate Site (41CM1), Comal County, Texas
late sub-period by the Toyah interval (Collins 1995,
2004). Scallorn and Edwards points are diagnostic
of the early sub-period and Perdiz is representative
of the Toyah interval.
Historic (ca. 500 B.P. to present)
Collins (2004) described three sub-periods for
the Historic period in Central Texas: early, middle
and late. The early sub-period begins in the late
seventeenth century with European contact and the
middle sub-period focuses largely on indigenous
life at Spanish missions. The late sub-period extends into present day, and documents the fading
presence of the Comanche in Central Texas.

The shelter formed by the overhanging
ledge was from two to 12 feet deep. A
rock fall, located approximately in the
center of the overhang, divided the shelter into two sections. The north section,
designated Area A, was tested extensively
and produced an abundance of cultural
material. The south section, Area B,
contained shallow deposits, but a test
in the center of the area produced only
sparse cultural remains. Several massive

The Oblate Shelter was formed by an

marine invertebrate fossils. The limeVWRQH? IRUPDWLRQ? ÁDQNLQJ? WKH? FUHHN? ZDV?
sculptured into many horizontal ledges
and overhangs by the meanderings of
the stream during an initial cutting phase.
Subsequent weathering and erosion have
caused most of these potential shelters
to collapse, but the ledge forming the
Oblate Shelter seems to have remained
essentially intact for several thousand
years. Flooding of the nearby Guadalupe
River, combined with weathering of the
limestone cliff, has gradually built up a
sandy deposit against the shelter wall.
The overhanging ledge extended for
some 150 feet along the eastern edge of
the creek valley just south of a dry arroyo.

large limestone boulders lay on the surface in the north section of the shelter.
After their locations were recorded, these
stones were broken up and rolled away
from the excavation area; other boulders
encountered during the excavation were
removed in a similar manner.
In front of the shelter a broad alluvial
terrace sloped for approximately 160 ft.
down to the creek channel. This damp
sandy soil was covered with a thick
growth of native grasses and small trees.
Shallow test excavations there produced
a considerable amount of cultural material including most of the potsherds
recovered. One deep test at N225-W130
encountered mussel shells, burned rocks,

Three stratigraphic zones were recognized by
Tunnell (Johnson et al. 1962:82-84) in his excavations at the Oblate site (Figures 7-9). Collins
(1966:10) summarized the zones and explained the
problems with correlating Tunnell’s zones with the

the overhang to gray-brown in the unprotected slope in front of the shelter.
Zone III, the uppermost layer in the site,
could be divided into two subzones in the
drier portions in the shelter. The lower
subzone, IIIa, was a compact tan sand,
possibly water deposited, and was less
than nine inches thick in the exposures
in which it could be recognized. Subzone

Tunnell has consistently referred to

indication that at least a portion of the
changes in texture and color are products
of weathering. Demarcations of the zones
was not sharp, as along unconformities or
bedding planes, and instead were gradational and may represent no geological
phenomenon other than leaching.

The geologic zones outlined above were
employed by Tunnell in demonstrating
the stratigraphic sequence of artifacts

the Oblate Site. For several reasons this
procedure is not practical in the analyses
of the specimens recovered in the 1963
excavations. As indicated by Tunnell,
zones became indistinct in the terrace in
front of the shelter; assignment of the 30
projectile points recovered in this area by
the 1963 excavations would, therefore,
not be reliable (30 specimens represent

assemblage of artifacts was recovered in

in the shelter as in the 12 feet of deposit
excavated in the terrace in front of the

Therefore, the time represented by the
extended column in the terrace should
be approximately equivalent to that represented in the compressed column inside
the shelter. A more detailed sequence of
artifacts will ordinarily result from excavations in a relatively deep deposit, such
as is the Oblate terrace.

was formulated to recover archeological evidence
bearing on the chronology of prehistoric occupations

hand-excavated units (Figure 10). Six of the units were
excavated within or immediately adjacent to the shelter (Units N240-W100, N230-W100, N215-W100,

N210-W100, N205-W105, and N160-W110 or Area

one unit set apart from the others is comprised of a 5

approximately (10 x 10 ft.) located east and southeast
of that square (Figure 10).
In addition to the six units within or adjacent to
the rock shelter, four units were positioned adjacent

block situated between the cave opening and the
creek (N240-W120, N240-W115, N235-W120, and

the angles of the depositional strata increased with

also found in this unit. One (Table 1, Lot 56) was

below Frio and Edgewood points, and a second
Ensor (Table 1, Lot 134) was uncovered in the
sediments (level 93.5–93.0 ft.) just below a Frio
point (Table 1, Lot 124). An untyped projectile
point with a bifurcated base (Table 1, Lot 31) was

IRXQG?LQ?D?ORZHU?OHYHO?EHORZ?WKH?ÀUVW?(QVRU?SRLQW?
(Table 1, Lot 56). The Frio point was uncovered in
the next level (94.0–93.5 ft.). A Marcos dart point
and a complete corner tang biface were recovered
near the bottom of the unit (level 93-92.5 ft.). No
features were found in this unit.
Other artifacts from this unit include a perforated shell fragment, choppers, scrapers, thin bifaFLDO?EODGHV?DQG?EODGH?IUDJPHQWV??FRUHV??DQG?ÁDNLQJ?
debitage. Organic materials were also recovered,
such as mussel shell, snail shell, bones, antler fragments, teeth, and charcoal.
Unit N240-W100 contains archeological deposits
that represent a chronological sequence that starts and
ends in the later half of the Late Archaic period. Finding a Montell within 1 ft. of the surface, however, suggests that the upper levels may have been disturbed.
Soils are described as dry and loosely compacted
above 95.5 ft elevation and becoming increasingly
compact below this elevation. This boundary may
provide a reasonable limit to the disturbance. Below
95.5 ft., the artifact sequence seems chronologically
reasonable, and sloping depositional strata could explain any concerns regarding the superposition of a
)ULR?SRLQW?DERYH?RI?WKH?(QVRU?SRLQWV??+RZHYHU??ÀQGLQJ?
two Ensor points separated by 2 ft. of sediments may
suggest that the uppermost Ensor was out of context.
This suggestion implies that the disturbance, likely
caused by a combination of erosion, rodent burrowing,
and human activities over the years, affected excavation levels even below 95.5 ft elevation.

Unit N205-W105 is at the front edge of the
shelter. A little more than half of the unit is beneath
the overhang of the shelter (see Figure 10). The
surface of N205-W105 likely dips to the northwest

bedrock is encountered in the northeast corner at

western side of the unit (outside of the shelter) were
a darker gray in color than sediments on the eastern

sediment zones, particularly those along the edge near
the top of the sediments, may be the product of soil
pedogenesis, but they were also stained by charcoal

Charcoal found in level 94.0-93.5 ft. (Tamers

(Table 4, Lot 37). The deepest Ensor point (Table
4, Lot 121) may also be associated with the feature, as it occurs in the level immediately below
it. Other artifacts from this unit included possible
knife fragments, bifaces, two unifacial scrapers,
heat-altered limestone, blade fragments, and
flaking debitage. Mussel shell was present, along
with snail shell, bone fragments, a mud dauber
nest, and charcoal. Mussel and shell fragments
were found throughout the unit. The bones and
charcoal were associated only with the feature.
The archeological deposits in Unit N205-W105
primarily represent Late Archaic remains similar
to those documented in Units N230-W100 and
N240-W100, with the exception of the one Scallorn point (Table 4, Lot 36), which is an early Late
Prehistoric projectile.

Because only one level was excavated in this
unit, there is no basis to assess the chronological
sequence of the recovered artifacts except in relation to the upper elevations of the level dug by
the high school students. However, the age of the

Terrace Unit
The Terrace Unit is a 10 ft. square block that
includes units N235-W115, N235-W120, N240W115, and N240-W120. The entire block is located
outside of the shelter on the terrace (Figure 10).
The surface slopes gently away from the shelter, generally southeast to northwest. Limestone
benches beneath the sediments step down to the
creek. The surface and the strata below the surface
generally follow the slope. However, the slope of
the surface is gentler than the slope of the lower
strata and excavators did not adjust levels to mirror the slope of these depositional strata. Therefore, the deeper depositional units have a stronger
slope and excavation levels were more likely to be
chronologically inconsistent because they cross-cut
deposits of differing ages.

Frio, Ellis, Edgewood, Marcos, Lange, Montell,

found in roughly that order, with Pedernales points
recovered from the bottom of the Terrace units.
The slope of the terrace strata is evident in the
elevation differences of similar projectile points
between the eastern squares and the western
squares. For example, in the upper portion of the

(see Table 7) and at 91.0-90.5 ft. elevation in the
western square N235-W120 (see Table 6). Lower
in the unit, Montell points were found at 89.0-88.5
ft elevation in the eastern half and 87.0-86.5 ft. in
the western half (see Tables 6 and 7). The deepest
Late Archaic dart point type, a Pedernales, was
encountered 1 ft. deeper (level 85.5-85.0 ft.) in
the eastern half of the Terrace Unit (see Table 6).
Feature 6, a small hearth in N235-W120, was associated with Pedernales points in level 85.5-85.0 ft.
Charcoal from this feature was radiocarbon dated
to a one sigma calibrated range of 4821–3083 B.P.
and a two sigma calibrated range of 5583-2349 B.P.
(Stuiver and Reimer 2011; Tamers et al. 1964:149).

of the feature was exposed in the southeastern

to extend to the south and east outside of any
excavated areas. A Montell point found in the same
level but outside of the feature may be roughly
contemporaneous with it. Feature 5 was 2 ft. below
Feature 4 at 87.0 ft elevation in Unit N235-W115

were individually recognized and recorded in the
1963 Oblate excavations. The following discussion provides a brief description of each of these
features.
Feature 1
Feature 1 is a lens of white ash exposed in
squares N215-W100 and N210-W100 between
96.2 and 95.5 ft. Excavators uncovered the feature
just below the surface at a depth assigned to Tunnell’s Zone 1 (Collins 1966). The white ash lens
was uncovered in the southern edge of N215-W100
and the northwestern corner of N210-W100 at 96.2
ft. In plan view, the feature is roughly triangular
and measures about 3.6 ft. east-west x 4.8 ft. northsouth and averages 0.5 ft. in thickness.

W100, excavators recognized three horizontal
layers in the ashy sediments of Feature 1. These
three layers, from the uppermost level (A) to the
lowest level (C), are described as: a white ash layer
(Lens C), a gray ash layer (Lens B), and a dark
ashy layer (Lens A) possibly mixed with burned
VHGLPHQW? 7$6??????ÀHOG?QRWHV ??7RJHWKHU??OHQVHV?
C and B are about 2.5 inches thick. Lens A is about
0.4 ft. thick. Using stratigraphic information from

three zones were carefully peeled off and each was
screened separately. The matrix of the unit levels
outside of the feature was a gray-brown ashy loam.
Scallorn (found in Lens A) and Perdiz

a single hackberry seed, charcoal (of a type not

debitage were present in the ash lens. There was

167

no rock-lined basin or any other indication of
a discrete hearth present with this feature. The
presence of a metal button (if not intrusive)
and Late Prehistoric arrow points suggests that
activities which occurred in both Historic and Late
Prehistoric times contributed to the formation of
Feature 1.
)HDWXUH??
Feature 2, located near the center of Unit
N230-W100 at an elevation of 94.0 to 93.65 ft., is
a concentration of small, burned limestone rocks
interpreted as a hearth. Several small (about 10
cm in length) rocks formed an oval measuring 1.9
x 1.0 ft that was 0.35 ft. thick. Among the rocks
were small amounts of charcoal and ash within a
gray silty matrix.
Bone fragments, snail and mussel shells, and
ÁDNLQJ? GHEULV? ZHUH? IRXQG? LQ? WKH? IHDWXUH?? .QLIH?
fragments and an Ellis point were located in the
same unit/level. The presence of an Ellis point at
the same depth as Feature 2, a Castroville point
just below the feature, and the proximity of a Frio
point one level below that, suggests that this is a
Late Archaic hearth feature.
)HDWXUH??
Feature 3 has been interpreted as a small
hearth. The hearth is located in the southwest corner of Unit N230-W100 at an elevation of 93.1 ft.
The feature measures 1.3 ft east-west x 1 ft. northsouth. In Unit N230-W100 an intruding boulder
or limestone shelf caused the stratigraphic layers
to follow the east to west slope of the limestone’s
surface. The ashy deposits associated with Features
2 and 3 measure 0.3-0.9 ft. thick and slope from
west to east. A careful reading of the level notes,

point base was uncovered. Field notes mention the
collection of charcoal samples from this feature but
there are no existing records of either their composition or radiocarbon dates. The discovery of the Frio
point base and the Castroville point stratigraphically
beneath the feature, suggests that it likely dates no
earlier than the latter part of the Late Archaic.

Feature 4 is a cluster of burned limestone rocks
in the Terrace Unit (N235-W115) at an elevation
of 89 ft. Terrace deposits at 89 ft. were described
as light tan alluvium. Only a portion of the feature
was exposed in the southeastern part of the square.
Four limestone cobbles, including three burned
rocks, surrounded an area that was darkened by
bits of charcoal. The exposed portion of the feature
measured 2.2 ft. north to south x 1 ft. east to west.
Associated deposits appeared to extend south and
east outside of the unit.
The base of a Montell point was found at the
same level in the same unit as Feature 4 and a
Marcos point was found in the level below that.
Montell and Marcos projectile points typically date
to the Late Archaic. Although these points were
not found within the feature, their proximity to the
feature in combination with their stratigraphic positions, suggests a Late Archaic age for the feature.

Feature 5 is 2 ft. below Feature 4 at 87.0 ft

Feature 6 is a hearth located in Unit N235W120 at 85.5 to 85.0 ft. elevation. The level in
which this hearth was located contained a Pedernales point. Moreover, three levels from 86.0
ft. to 84.5 ft. in this unit and the adjacent unit
produced one Marcos point and three Pedernales
points. These four specimens represent the earliest,
or at least stratigraphically the lowest, artifacts
recovered from the Oblate site, and therefore are
roughly contemporaneous with Feature 6. UnLGHQWLÀHG? FKDUFRDO? PDWHULDO? IURP? )HDWXUH? ?? ZDV?

Keeping in mind that the perspective of
the film being produced influenced the primary
strategy for the 1963 excavation, and that it was
a field school where non-professionals were
learning new skills, the results fit well with those
from earlier work. However, it is important to
be objective when analyzing the findings of an
investigation, especially an excavation, and so,
before discussing data recovered from the field
school, we must look carefully at the methodology
employed during the project.

Typically, the terrace deposits at the Oblate site
are sandy brown loams near the surface that grade
to light brown loams in the lower levels; beneath
these deposits, limestone benches stair-step down
to the creek below. The surface and the strata below
the surface generally follow the slope. However, the
slope of the surface is gentler than the stair-stepped
slope of the bedrock. Depositional strata radiate to
the northwest from the face of the southeastern-most
bench. Generally, the angles of the depositional strata
increase with depth. These strata become progressively thicker with distance from the benches. The

As a result, the deeper levels in the excavation
units did not follow the chronologically layered,
sloping, terrace strata. In the lower levels, sediments in the south or southeastern part of the unit

or northwestern part. Undisturbed levels closer to
the surface more closely represent the depositional
chronology than the lower levels. Units within the
shelter are more level than those outside of the
shelter. Units within or adjacent to the shelter slope
more east to west and the Terrace Unit strata slope
more northeast to southwest. For example, the
surface of N215-W100 and N210-100W is more
level than squares from the Terrace Unit. Simply
put, the recovered contents of lower levels are not
chronologically consistent across units, and observation of what soil zones comprised each level
was also inconsistent, so there are bound to be erURUV?LQ?ÀHOG?LQWHUSUHWDWLRQV??&ROOLQV·?OLWKLF?DQDO\VLV?

Analysis
Results of the 1959 excavations were critical toward the establishment of a sequence, or as
Tunnell put it, a “vertical and/or horizontal disWULEXWLRQµ? IRU? &HQWUDO?7H[DV? GDUW? SRLQWV? -RKQVRQ?
1962:120). Tunnell had divided the site’s alluvial
deposits into three roughly horizontal zones (I, II,
and III) based on differences in composition and
color of the sediments. All three zones contained
archeological materials.
Projectile points from the lowest zone, Zone
I, included Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Castroville, and Marcos dart point types. In Collins’s

169

(2004) Central Texas chronology, these points
represent the earliest four style intervals of the Late
Archaic period (see Figure 3). Tunnell (Johnson
et al. 1962) placed these points in the Edwards
Plateau Aspect, a now defunct term.
Zone II diagnostics included Ensor, Fairland,
and Frio dart points. These three points are the
PDUNHUV?RI?&ROOLQV·? ???????????????? ?ÀIWK?VW\OH?
interval of the Late Archaic. In Johnson et al.’s
(1962) chronology these points were also representative of the Edwards Plateau Aspect. In Zone
III, Cliffton, Granbury, Perdiz, and Scallorn arrow
points, pottery, and European trade goods (a glass
bead and metal gun parts) were found. Tunnell
assigned Zone III to the Central Texas Aspect,
DQRWKHU?GHIXQFW?DUFKHRORJLFDO?FODVVLÀFDWRU\?WHUP??
Collins has assigned these arrow point forms to two
different style intervals within the Late Prehistoric
(Collins 1995, 1998, 2004). Metal artifacts and a
glass bead date to Historic times.

Though Collins and Tunnell report a variety

relating to Late and Middle Archaic projectile
chronology have historically been the focus of
most Oblate site data citations, particularly relating
to Pedernales projectile points. For the purposes of
this analysis, distribution tables are presented for
both the 1963 excavation (Table 9) and a compilation table containing dart point distributions for all
of the Oblate excavations (Table 10). The major
difference between the two distributions is Tunnell’s observation of the presence of Pedernales
projectiles at depths below Level 17.
While there have been some changes in projectile typology since the 1960s, these have mostly
consisted of acknowledgement of morphological
variation within diagnostic types. This is especially
true for variants of Ensor, Montell, and Pedernales
projectiles. In fact, there is so much stem-form variation within the Pedernales type, that it has caused
some scholars to completely reassess it for regional
and temporal differences (Turner et al. 2011:148).

Pedernales projectiles (Figure 16) are generally accepted as being associated within the early
half of the Late Archaic (3500- 2500 B.P) (Collins
???? ??7XUQHU?HW?DO?? ???????? ?GHÀQHV?WKLV?VDPH?
time frame as being within the Middle Archaic, but
time frame terminology aside, there would seem to
be agreement between Collins (2004) and Turner
et al. (2011) in terms of the overall chronological
scheme and within established style intervals.
Comparing Tunnell’s projectile point chronology (see Figure 2) to Collin’s chronology (see Figure 16), we can see that the major difference is that
Tunnell placed the Pedernales within the Middle
Archaic. Tunnell collected a sample from what he
GHVFULEHG?DV?´0L[HG?=RQHV?,?DQG?,,µ?WKDW?ZDV?GHÀQHG?DV?ODWH?0LGGOH?$UFKDLF?RU?HDUO\?/DWH?$UFKDLF??
That sample dated to a one sigma range of 21141736 B.P. (calibrated) and a two sigma range of
2313-1571 B.P. (Stuiver and Reimer 2011; Tamers
et al. 1964:148-149). The date ranges with highest
reported probabilities are a one sigma calibrated
rage of 2073-1769 B.P. (one sigma calibrated with
85.3% probability) and 2313-1600 B.P. (two sigma
calibrated with a 99.5% probability). Tamers et
al. (1964:148-149) noted that the date seemed too
recent and given that the sample was collected
from a mixed zone of alluvial sands would seem
to bear out this observation and negate the results
for serious consideration.
A single charcoal sample associated with a
Pedernales projectile was also collected, as noted
above, from the Terrace unit, and submitted for radiocarbon dating. As with all of the samples taken
at the Oblate site, the material composition of the
charcoal was not recorded for this critical sample.
As noted, the sample dated to a one sigma calibrated range of 4821–3083 B.P. and a two sigma
calibrated range of 5583-2349 B.P. (Stuiver and
Reimer 2011; Tamers et al. 1964:149). The date
ranges with highest reported probabilities are a
one sigma calibrated range of 4729–3156 B.P. (one
sigma calibrated with a 95.6% probability) and a
two sigma calibrated range of 5490-2349 B.P. (two
sigma calibrated with a 99.2% probability) (Stuiver
and Reimer 2011; Tamers et al. 1964:149). While
these dates would seem to bear out a Middle Archaic (6000-4000 B.P., the current accepted age range
for the Middle Archaic Period in Central Texas, see
Figure 16) distribution for the Pedernales point, the
wide range in the reported date for the Terrace unit
sample would seem inconclusive. Mueggenborg
(1991) reported a corrected radiocarbon date range

175

of 4220-4100 B.P. for charcoal associated with
Pedernales points, but it too was composed of a
single sample and is controversial.
Since the results of absolute dating of samples
collected at the Oblate site seem to be broad and
inconclusive, the main focus of any conclusions
to be drawn from the research performed there
must rely solely on the stratigraphic provenience
of recovered artifacts. At the time of the Oblate
excavations, the results would have been very informative; however, improved radiocarbon dating
techniques and technology, along with an increased
number of samples from a larger inventory of

absolute chronology of more Late Archaic sites
than were known in the 1960s. In addition, Collins
(2004) noted the importance of gisements in creating his Central Texas archeological chronology
(see Figure 16), something, due to erosion and the
slope of described soil zones, the Oblate site lacks.

to have a well-documented history of alluvial
deposition. Pedernales-Kinney interval artifacts
were consistently the deepest and oldest components in both the TAS and the TASP excavations.
The earliest terrace strata are resting on bedrock.
Unfortunately, the radiocarbon date obtained from
just above bedrock returned a date range with a
very wide standard deviation, and therefore was
not very informative. However, the Oblate results

Ten examples of painted textiles from the Lower Pecos River region of Texas are described; eight of them have
been radiocarbon dated to the Middle and Late Archaic periods and one is considered Late Archaic based on its
association with projectile points characteristic of that era. The inventory consists of mats, cremation pouches,
baskets, a skull cap, and a belt. All are mortuary goods fortuitously preserved by burial in dry rock shelter
deposits and all but one were exhumed in the 1930s, either by relic hunters or by institutionally sponsored
excavations. The designs are geometric, in keeping with the background medium, and are usually painted with
red pigment. The single exception has both red and dark brown lines. It has long been assumed that painted
textiles came late in the Lower Pecos sequence but one set of three can now be attributed to the Middle Archaic
period, thus extending the range of this particular form of mortuary offering by over 1000 years.

The 10 painted textiles discussed here were
exhumed from dry rock shelters in the Lower Pecos
region of southwest Texas as long ago as the 1930s
and as recently as the 1970s (Figure 1). All are
mortuary goods, part of a long-standing tradition of
ZUDSSLQJ?WKH?ÁH[HG?ERG\?RI?WKH?GHFHDVHG?LQ?OD\HUV?
of matting and burying this bundle in the dry, ashy
shelter deposits. Painted textiles have long been
considered a late innovation in the Lower Pecos.
This assumption was based in part on a few radiocarbon assays done in the 1970s, some temporally
meaningful grave inclusions, and stratigraphic
associations. Two of these dates and four AMS assays run for a larger study of this mortuary practice
are applicable to the painted textiles in this sample
(Table 1). Three of them do fall in the expected
Blue Hills subperiod of the Late Archaic period
(2300-1300 B.P.), but one is slightly younger and
two are over 1000 years older, thus indicating a
much earlier starting date for textile painting.
Five of the painted specimens were unearthed
by three different institutions during the 1930s
rush to the Lower Pecos in search of museum
quality artifacts. One was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution, who sponsored excavations in
Moorehead and Goat caves on the Pecos River and
other sites in the Big Bend region (Setzler 1934;

Prewitt 1970; Maslowski 1978). One was in a very
elaborate grave uncovered by a Witte Museum
expedition to the Shumla Caves, north of the Rio
Grande and west of the Pecos River (Martin 1933;
McGregor 1992), and three were in one bundle that
was discovered by the University of Texas in the
Horseshoe Caves south of the small community of
Comstock (Butler 1948).

than the outer coarser covering. A pad of grass was
laid beneath the infant’s head between the second
and third mats. The only other artifacts were cords
and a leather thong that apparently held the bundle
together, and several sticks that may have pinned
the bundle in place.
The bundle had been exhumed by relic hunters
and later analyzed at Southern Methodist University, where the site number X41VV1 [SMU usually

the site and noted occupational debris, pictographs,
cut marks and polishing facets, as well as shallow
depressions that may have been the result of relic
hunter activity that removed other burials from the
site (Francis Stickney, cited by Banks and Rutenberg [1982:9]).
The belt is now in two pieces that are 5 cm
wide and total 70 cm long. Banks and Rutenberg
(1982:18) describe it as “woven from cordage

about 2 cm wide and 2 cm apart, were painted perpendicular to the long axis, and leather thongs were
woven into the fabric so that they dangled from
the lower edge of the belt. Some sort of ornament
might have been suspended from these thongs. The
belt was probably an item of clothing since similar
but unpainted items have been found in the graves
of adult women. In one case, a fragment of a woven
belt buried with a woman and a child dated to ca.
1825 years ago (Turpin, n.d.). Yet another belt was
wrapped around the waist of a woman buried with
a cremated man in Moorehead Cave and dated to
1605-1915 B.P. (Table 1; SI1131) (Setzler 1934:35;

Double burials are not all that uncommon in
the Lower Pecos region but, in the case of Moorehead Cave (41VV55), the fourth of 14 graves
excavated by the Smithsonian Institution in 1931
contained both burned and unburned skeletal remains (Setzler 1934; Maslowski 1978:41-52). The

age of 1700 ± 70 B.P., which corrected and calibrated indicates the bundle was interred between
A.D. 35-345 (see Table 1). This date is solidly

In 1931, a Lower Pecos resident donated a collection of grave goods that included three decorative
pouches to the Museum of the Big Bend in Alpine,
Texas (Smith 1933; McGregor 1992:96). Their provenience was given as “an Indian shelter or cave on

Specimen 1647, listed as a cremation pouch,
is a decorative mat that has been folded into thirds
and stitched along the bottom and sides to make a
packet 27 cm wide. The mat is not painted but like
the mats from Moorehead Cave and Mummy Shelter (see below), the weaver used a series of shifts
to create a pattern of linked squares or diamonds.
The same 2/2 interval technique was used
to weave Specimen 1649a, which is also a mat
folded and sewn along two edges into a package
36 cm wide. The mat had been painted with bold
red nested zigzag and straight lines crossed by
thick vertical and horizontal dark brown lines of
equal width. The intervals between the lines are
imprecise but the paint is dense and applied with
apparent vigor. The sources of the pigments have
not been determined but walnuts produce a dark
brown dye and red could be made from leather
stem plants (Aggie 2011) or cochineal, the tiny

Specimen 1848a is also a mat folded into a
pouch and held together with long red Z-twist cord
stitches that crosscut the painted design (Figure 3).
Broad red lines parallel the long edges of the mat.
Between them, a four-pointed star or cross is also
painted in red pigment. This pouch is more frayed

(1992:87) provides more detail, classifying this
specimen as Pouch Type C, made by twill plaiting,

Diagonal stripes were painted in deep red pigment.
The bundle has not been radiocarbon-dated but
can be assigned to the Late Archaic period by an
Ensor dart point that fell from the wrappings. This
projectile point style is a hallmark of the Blue Hills
subperiod (Turpin 1991) and was popular throughout much of the state between 200 B.C. and A.D.
600 (Turner and Hester 1993:114).

On the more recent end of the temporal scale,
two painted mats were used to wrap the remains of
an adult male who was exhumed by a local collector
in the 1930s (Turpin et al. 1986). The rock shelter
where he found the bundle was later given the trinomial 41VV656 and the informal name Mummy

wrapped in a series of mats, two of which were
decorative. The simpler specimen has a shift pattern
that outlines a square with a hole in each of the visible corners and a red line parallels the upper edge.
On the more complicated mat, a series of shifts from
2/2 to 2/3 were used to create linked diamonds that

of his digestive tract were analyzed and produced a
radiocarbon age of 1150 ± 50 years ago. No correction factor was applied at the time and the original
data sheet is missing but the estimated calendric age

would fall between A.D. 645 and 1030 (Turpin et al.
1986), slightly later than the Blue Hills subperiod
but possibly still within the Late or Transitional
Archaic period. The traits that differentiate between
the end of the Archaic and the beginning of the Late
Prehistoric period are not well dated and there are

The oldest painted textiles are in an infant
bundle attributable to the Middle Archaic period.
In 1936, the University of Texas sponsored excavation of two adjacent caves in the Lower Pecos,
the so-called Horseshoe Caves, later assigned the
trinomial 41VV171. The recovered material was
reported by Butler (1948), who designated this
bundle as AV1. An infant had been placed on a
large twilled mat and covered with a split decorated

been placed on the infant’s head and another was
placed with the bundle. Next to and under the body
were four shell pendants: two were shaped like diamonds and two were shaped like projectile points.
Twelve Olivella shells were near the diamondshaped mussel shells. Four short reed segments
decorated with incised lines and lashed together
into two pairs and a single reed were placed by the
child. The edges of the outer mat were then pulled
up to envelope the bundle and the entire package
was put in a large netted bag before it was laid on
a bed of grass, leaves and twigs that lined a crevice
in the rock (Butler 1948:5).
Designs on skull caps and the covering basket were created by a shift from 1/1 to 1/2 that

1948:36). The two smaller baskets measured 15
cm in diameter and were 10 cm deep. A pattern of
linked diamonds radiated from the base, increasing
in size toward the rim (Figure 4). The alternating
rows were painted red, emphasizing the design.
The larger basket, when split, was 61 cm long and
30 cm wide. The same shift technique was used
to create parallel zigzag lines that run from top to
bottom (Butler 1948:36); alternating rows were

calibrated dates overlap between 1760-1900 B.C
(3710-3850 cal B.P. see Table 1) This places the
interment in the middle of the San Felipe subperiod
of the Middle Archaic period (3200-4300 B.P.) in
the local chronology (Turpin 1991). This was a
time of increasing regionalization as manifested
in distinct projectile point and rock art styles,
providing a context in accord with more elaborate
mortuary behavior.

by the weavers. All of the designs are geometric,
in keeping with the background medium (Figure
6), but in some cases, structural and non-structural
decorations are employed on the same mat with
paint serving to emphasize the pattern created by
shift changes. In three instances, unpainted mats
with some type of structural patterning were paired
with painted specimens (41VV55, 41VV656,
Museum of the Big Bend). Some of the designs
on the Late Archaic mats are made up of swathes
of pigment that are broadly applied, making
their own design independent of the weaving. In

These 10 examples of painted
weavings are probably but a fraction of the number that was buried
in antiquity. Pearce and Jackson
(1932) mention painted mats taken
from 41VV75 in Seminole Canyon
by collectors, and two local men
who had worked for Setzler in 1932
told me of others they had seen
taken from Goat Cave (41VV67),
Moorehead Cave (41VV55), Panther Cave (41VV83), and 41VV75
by relic hunters.
In keeping with the general
consensus, the radiocarbon assays
reported here confirm that the
majority of the painted mats are
from Late Archaic graves and date
between 930 and 2150 cal. years
B.P. The single exception, the infant bundle from Horseshoe Cave,
is at least 1000 years earlier than

all of the grave goods in this burial
are unique or valuable items, in
keeping with the heightened ritual
activity during this time period.
The people of the Lower
Pecos were adroit exploiters of the
local vegetation and the painted
textiles are one of the more laborintensive products of a longstanding tradition of using plants
and plant fibers to fulfill both
mundane and ritual needs. Both the
painted and unpainted mats in these
bundles exemplify the skill attained

since interment probably took place shortly after
death, at least in the cases where mummification
set in. Even the most skilled workers would need
time to process the materials, weave the textiles,
and paint them. It seems more likely that these
artifacts were made for the living and kept with
them in death.
Supposedly an egalitarian society, such as that
usually attributed to the Lower Pecos hunter-gathHUHUV?? JUDYH? JRRGV? UHÁHFW? DFTXLUHG? VWDWXV?? HDUQHG?

of the painted textiles were recovered from three
infant graves. Another three came from two adult
male burials and one contained the remains of a
cremated man buried with an adult woman. The
age and gender of the person who was apparently
cremated and placed in a woven pouch that was
later donated to the Museum of the Big Bend are
not recorded. No satisfactory reason has been given
to explain why and when cremation was preferred
over burial, but both infants and adult males were
so treated. Status may have been a factor in the
more elaborate male burials but that does not explain the care paid to infant bundles, which directly
contravenes the idea that egalitarian hunting and
gathering groups would not dispose of status items
or high energy grave goods in children’s graves
(Binford 1971:22).
Although the sample is too small for sweeping
generalizations, some common threads may be representative of the larger population. That all of the
painted textiles were found in mortuary contexts
is undoubtedly in part a function of the preservation afforded by tightly bound compact bundles
which were usually placed against the rear wall
of the shelters where the disturbance from normal
occupational activities would be less. Nevertheless, the very presence of these textiles, as well
as fur robes, shell, seed and bone ornaments, and
baskets in the bundles, indicates that the people of
WKH?/RZHU?3HFRV?KRQRUHG?WKHLU?GHDG?E\?VDFULÀFLQJ?
labor-intensive goods for no tangible return. Such
altruism is often rooted in a belief system that
anticipates an afterlife where physical needs are
met by symbolic offerings of clothing, tools, and
luxury goods.

number of sites in Texas. This article discusses one of these sites, 41VV2079, a small rock shelter located on
Pump Canyon off the Rio Grande near Langtry, Texas. Sayles’ excavations revealed shallow deposits that dated
from the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period. Sayles also recovered painted pebbles, now curated at
TARL, which are the focus of this paper. Building on previous interpretations of the meaning and use of the
painted pebbles, the author examines patterns in the imagery through time and reveals new details suggesting

Edward Booth (Ted) Sayles, an early amateur
pioneer in Southwestern archeology embarked
on an ambitious archeological survey of sites in
Texas in the 1930s. At the time Sayles was working for the Gila Pueblo Archeological Foundation,
a private research organization of the University
of Arizona (Huckell et al. 1997). After the Gila
Pueblo foundation was dissolved in 1950, the archives, including notes, photos, and artifacts were
donated to Arizona State Museum of the University
of Arizona where Sayles’archeological collections,

were originally catalogued and stored. Arizona

and photos to the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) of the University of Texas at
Austin (Sayles 1932). Among the artifacts that
Sayles collected from 41VV2079 were 21 painted
pebbles now archived at TARL, only 18 with visible imagery, which are the focus of this article.
Sayle’s objective in the 1930s in extending
his archeological excavations to Texas was momentous. As he states in his 1935 volume (Sayles
1935:85):
7KH?SXUSRVH?RI?WKLV?VXUYH\?LV?WR?GHÀQH?WKH?
cultures of Texas and their boundaries; to
determine the relations which may once
have existed between the tribes of Texas

and those of adjoining sections; and to
seek traces of the origin, or of the passage, of the Hohokam, the agricultural
colonists of southern Arizona, whose
provenance has not yet been discovered.

Sayles followed in the path of early Texas
archeologists such as Martin (1933) who were adamant in insisting that the Lower Pecos rock shelters
were an extension of the Big Bend Basket Makers
of the Southwest despite differences between the
two areas. At this time little was known about the
/RZHU?3HFRV?UHJLRQ??DQ?DUHD?GH¿QHG?E\?WKH?WKUHH?
rivers which course through its canyons: the Rio
Grande, the Pecos, and the Devil’s rivers. The region extends roughly 50 miles to the west, north,
DQG?HDVW?RI?WKH?FRQÀXHQFH?RI?WKH?3HFRV?5LYHU?ZLWK?
the Rio Grande, into northern Coahuila, Mexico.
The painted pebbles represent one of the oldest
and longest traditions of painted mobiliary art in
the Americas beginning during the Early Archaic
period (8900-5500 BP) and continuing through the
Late Prehistoric period (1320-450 BP).
Sayles’ 1932 excavations focused on three sites
that were given temporary designations. Two sites,
TX X: 2:8 (41VV164), and TX X: 2:9 (41VV167
[Eagle Cave also was tested by Sayles]) were located in Mile Canyon, known at the time as Eagle
Nest Canyon, one mile east of Langtry. The painted
pebbles recovered from the third site excavated by
Sayles, TX X: 2:10, now 41VV2079, are the focus

of Pump Canyon, a tributary of Osman Canyon

Rio Grande. Its name derives from the fact that the

engine. Jack Skiles recalls as a child climbing the
ladder (196 steps) from the bottom of the canyon to
the top. From there he and his friends would walk
down the tracks to the Langtry grammar school
(Skiles1996: 127).
Skiles (personal communication January,
2012) shared his recollections regarding the location of 41VV2079:
The cave is located about one mile up
the canyon from the Rio Grande and on
the south bank of the canyon. It consists
of two joining shelters, one that had a
substantial amount of ashes and the other
with mostly solid rock. It was completely
excavated but I do not remember who did
it. I have looked three separate times for
information that I think I have about the

more accurate assessment of chronology and more
subtle intrasite and intersite comparisons. Sayles
plotted the pebbles on a plan map but unfortunately
did not specify an artifact number for each pebble,
thus eliminating the possibility of acquiring useful contextual data. These details, however, may
not have been of use since the site is shallow (18
inches at the deepest level) and both the actions
of ancient occupants and more recent rodents’
nests and grazing of goats and sheep compromised
stratigraphic integrity. This is not unusual in the

in Table 6 of his 1935 volume, The Archeological
Survey of Texas. In the spirit of the archeological
paradigm of the times, Sayles was interested in
looking at broad cultural patterns; thus, he combined the archeological materials recovered from
41VV2079 with 41VV164 and 41VV167 in Mile
Canyon with other Lower Pecos rockshelters in
his chart. As a result, with the exception of the
painted pebbles archived at TARL, I was not able
to accurately single out certain artifacts or items
that were unique to 41VV2079.

The Lower Pecos people were diversified foragers and hunters who lived in small kin groups
in these rock shelters based on seasonally available food resources in the area. Deep layers of
well-preserved cultural materials such as coiled
or twilled basket fragments, nets, cordage, sandals, wooden artifacts, burned limestone, stone,
bone, and shell have been recovered in the dry
midden deposits. Randomly scattered among the
fiber layers and in the ashy midden fill are the
many river-rolled pebbles, often broken, many
of which display painted imagery. The painted
pebbles are rarely found outside the Lower Pecos
area but a few have been found in the Big Bend
area of southwest Texas (Martin and Woolford
1932; Roberts 2010).
The painted pebbles display different distributional patterns through time and space in the Lower
Pecos region. For instance, they are not found in
all rock shelters. Unpainted stream rolled pebbles
were sometimes noted in early archeological investigations but were not recovered due to their
great numbers. Apparently, either the imagery was

Mock—41VV2079: Rock Shelter Excavated by Ted Sayles in 1932 193
erased or eroded through time or unpainted stones
were stockpiled for future use by the inhabitants of
the rock shelters. The majority of painted pebbles
have been recovered from larger sites such as Eagle
Cave in Mile Canyon or Fate Bell in Seminole
Canyon, apparently popular locales for long term
residence or seasonal aggregations over thousands
of years. Sharing few symbols, but co-occurring in
some cases with the pictographs in the rockshelters
(e. g., Kirkland and Newcomb 1996), the painted
pebble tradition highlights the complex cultural
matrix and worldview of these people who lived
a highly mobile hunting and gathering existence.
My objective was to review Sayles’ notes, and
examine the painted pebbles archived at TARL,
LI?SRVVLEOH?XQGHU?PDJQL¿FDWLRQ??DQG?WR?GRFXPHQW?
them with digital photos and illustrations. Included
in my examination was an assessment of the degree
of polish indicating curation, alterations such as
scratching, incising, over painting, breakage, or
type of medium used (e.g., liquid paint or crayon)
to detect patterns. Pebbles also may have been
selected for qualities such as size, form, smoothness, color, or rarity, choices that also can provide
patterns as to individual artists or geographical
preferences. The pebbles, in most cases, were not

In previous papers I proposed that the forms
were chosen, painted, and used by women during
life cycle events such as puberty or parturition
rituals (Mock 2011, 2012). They typically occur in
rock shelters where women’s social and economic
activities as well as child rearing occurred. The
painting of the pebbles provided a medium for
women to negotiate their gender roles in these
intimate social settings (Hays-Gilpin (2004:12).
Typically puberty ceremonies among North
American Indians encompassed a reenactment
of mythic events and a recitation of ancestral
histories (Farrer 1988:239). These “coming of
age” rituals often involved the use of rock art
(e.g., Dubois 1908:93-96). This degree of integration in such rituals, for instance, is recorded
in ethnographic accounts of Luiseno “maturation
of girls” ceremonies (Oxendine 1980) which had
the creative potential to relay many meanings
and functions simultaneously. The imagery could
relate to stories of ancestors, beliefs about their
spiritual world, social networking, or even economic concerns such as the search for food.
First, I will describe and discuss the painted
pebbles from 41VV2079, comparing and contrasting

them to other painted pebble collections I have
VWXGLHG??6HFRQG??,?ZLOO?DVVLJQ?WKHP?WR?VSHFLÀF?WLPH?
periods as established in the Lower Pecos cultural
history. Finally, in the ensuing discussion I will
address intriguing patterns observed in the painted
imagery and possible connections to other sites.
The painted pebbles from 41VV2079 may provide
a springboard to further examine these patterns
in terms of cultural boundaries or population
movements on this landscape. When combined
with other patterns observed in the archeological
record in the future, these observations may further

drills were also recovered from his excavations.
In describing cooking features, Sayles provided
DQ?LOOXVWUDWLRQ?LQ?KLV?ÀHOG?QRWHV³D?FLUFOH?RI?EXUQHG?
prickly pear pads in the center of which were remnants of a burned sotol bulb, known as a staple food
source among American Indians (Dering 1999).
This feature represents a process in which the cactus pads were placed on hot rocks to add moisture
to the cooking process. After the sotol was baked,
it was pounded and formed into an edible pieces
to be dried and stored. Sayles also observed yucca
and sotol quids distributed throughout the deposit.
Other items collected during excavations included a pitted stone mano that was probably used
to break up walnuts, seeds, or mesquite beans (see
Sayles 1935: Plate XVIId) and a probable buffalo
gourd and several gourd fragments with an attached string perhaps used as rattles. Evidence for
buffalo gourds in the form of seeds was also found
at Hind’s Cave and dates to the Middle and Late
Archaic (Dering 1979, 1999). As a food source
the seeds were roasted or boiled, or ground into a
meal. The root of the gourd also is known for its
medicinal properties.

two bone objects, one of which was possibly an
ornament which he did not describe, and a metate
he suggested was used to grind pigment.
During the Late Archaic Blue Hills subperiodperiod infants received special burial treatment,
and were wrapped in rabbit skin robes or animal
skins tied in bundles with mats and placed on grass
beds (Turpin 1992: 7-17; 1994: 69-84). However,
Turpin (2011:6) reports that an infant burial recently dated from Horseshoe Ranch Cave surprisingly
revealed Middle Archaic dates. As Turpin observes,
however, the sample size is small and could easily
be changed by more dates.

Now I return to the focus of this paper, the
18 pebbles with visible paint, recovered from
41VV2079.1 I have arranged the pebbles in a
projected chronological sequence based on the recovery of lithic indices and stratigraphic evidence
recovered at Lower Pecos sites such as Arenosa
(Parsons 1986). The occupants of 41VV2079 for
the most part followed the artistic template established elsewhere, choosing stream rolled pebbles
from the Rio Grande, Pecos, and Devil’s rivers on
which to paint to the exclusion of other available
stones. I have argued that the characteristics and
origins of the pebbles in the rivers were perhaps as
important as the image that was inscribed on the
pebble (Mock 2011;2012; in press, also see Conkey
1980:245), evoking the power of place (Young
1988:159) and its relation to ancestral happenings
in this area of the canyon lands drained by the Rio
Grande, Pecos, and Devil’s rivers.
The majority of artists from 41VV2079 favored black pigment as a primary medium applied
ZLWK?D?ÀQH?EUXVK?DQG?OLTXLG?SDLQW?RU?LQ?FUD\RQ?OLNH?
strokes. The artists also used red pigment to apply,
add to, or to superimpose designs or random marks
on the pebbles. The back of one pebble with ground
edges was smeared with liquid red paint. Whether
painted or scraped on the pebble, red pigment had
the potential to layer the iconography with additional complex meanings related to blood.
Some of the pebbles display a sequence of
DGGLWLRQDO?VXUIDFH?PRGLÀFDWLRQV?VXFK?DV?VFUDWFKLQJ??
scraping, battering, repainting, directional abrasion,
and/or superimposition of other motifs. These
actions may have occurred simultaneously or over
a period of time in a sequence of ritual events.

Some pebbles reveal an oily or greasy surface or
exhibit smoothing and polish, more than would
be expected if used in a single episode, suggesting
curation (Mock 1987, 2011, 2012). Others reveal
faint detailed incised lines or lines etched by a
VKDUS?LQVWUXPHQW?VXFK?DV?D?ÁLQW?ÁDNH??7KHVH?DGGLWLYH?
and subtractive alterations demonstrate a common
deep-rooted cosmology (also occurring in the
pictographs) and may have been intended to add to
or extend a previous message or to nullify a previous
meaning (Mock 1987, 2012).
Once painted, many of the pebbles from
41VV2079, as with pebbles from other rock
shelters in the Lower Pecos, appear deliberately

story was completed and then was thrown out or effectively terminated; thus, the imagery did not have
a perpetual audience as did the more permanent
pictographs. This ritualistic template is observed
in the disposal and breakage of portable art in
cultures around the world. For instance, evidence
from Mesoamerica indicates that the separation of
the broken parts of a ceramic vessel was a stated
goal; the parts could not be put back together again,
thus effectively terminating the power inherent in
the object (Mock 1999).

time: Eagle (Ross 1965), Shumla Caves (Martin

emphasize again that this interpretation must be

The third group of painted pebbles examined
from 41VV2079 dating to the Late Archaic (23001300 BP..) is not well represented at 41VV2079
in contrast to other sites. During this time period,
bison herds retreated as arid conditions set in,
perhaps contributing to the expansion of desertadapted people from Mexico into the area (Turpin

Mile Canyon (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). The
painted pebbles are rarely found outside the Lower
Pecos but a few sharing similar imagery have been
found in the Big Bend area of southwest Texas
(Martin and Woolford 1932; Roberts 2009, 2010).

a new artistic tradition revealing a preference for
anthropomorphic-shaped river pebbles on which
to paint. Anatomical details of the female form are
represented more realistically with the head, face,
and eyes depicted on the constricted end.
The human body, in particular the female form,
was used as a model for structuring the natural environment among indigenous people of the Americas
DQG?ERGLO\?IXQFWLRQV?PLPLFNHG?WKH?ÁRZ?RI?ULYHUV??
Rivers were conceptualized as the vaginal canal,
as veins and arteries, or umbilical cords (Mock
2011:118). The vertical midline on the painted forms
generally continues but the horizontal midsection
now shows new gendered motifs such as variations of the open vulva (represented by motifs such
as a bracket, ovals, split ovals, or closed circle),
often with pubic hair fringe. The arms are shown
outstretched, representing a receptive or breeching
position that may suggest sex or birth. Wavy lines
often are depicted in this group emanating from the
YXOYD??ZKLFK?PD\?UHSUHVHQW?ZDWHU??DPQLRWLF?ÁXLG??RU?
menstrual blood (e.g., Mock 2011:Figure 6d-e, i).
Breasts may be represented by strategically placed
black dots. More repetitive patterns of black dots or
lines may suggest tattoos or body decorations.
The pebble in Figure 17 exhibits unusual anthropomorphic imagery executed on a very thin
abraded spall rather than a river pebble (also see
Sayles 1935:Plate XVIIIc). The back of the pebble
shows directional diagonal lines scraped from top to
bottom in continuous action with a sharp instrument.
The central vertical line, rather than a mid-line horizontal that depicts a female vulva or its metaphoric
equivalent, features a spider-like element with a
small central circle that resembles imagery from
the Early Archaic (8900-5500 B.P.)(see Mock 2011:
Figures 3-4). The imagery on the second pebble in
Figure 18, although eroded, reveals four parallel,
vertical lines that extend from the top of the stone
and partially down the back, also showing similarity
to the Early Archaic. An attempt by the artist to show
open arms (the receptive position), a characteristic
of this group, is indicated by the crude curved lines
on either side of the central element or vulva. A
curvilinear design on the back continues the lines
from the front of the pebble.

B.P.) based in part on the recovery of an arrow point
shaft in 41VV2079 and previous chronological assessments made by Mock (2011) and Parsons (1986).
The earliest appearance of arrow points in the Lower
Pecos occurs around A.D. 650 at Arenosa Shelter.
The painted pebbles dated to the Late Prehistoric
occur in fewer numbers and are typically found in
shallow deposits. Pebbles selected for painting at this
time by Lower Pecos artists are smaller, ovoid forms.
Parallel, vertical lines emanating from the top of the
stone continue from earlier periods.
A distinguishing feature of the imagery is the
black cap of hair on the front of the pebble that
extends to the back (Figures 19 and 20; also see
Sayles 1935:Plate XVIII). The cap of hair partly
covers chevron eyes as shown in Figure 19. Additional painted chevrons on both sides of this pebble
probably represent body decoration or tattoos. The
surface shows a series of shallow vertical striations
with a sharp instrument as does the broken medial

fragment of a pebble, based on the distinct imagery,
also placed in this group (Figure 21). The fringed
black mouth shown on Figures 19 and 21, and
comparison to imagery on other pebbles from sites
dating to this time period, suggests that the mouth
is a metaphor for the vulva (see Mock 1987:Figure
23c, 2011:Figure 7d). The mouth is more realistically portrayed in Figure 20.
Geometric designs, featuring motifs consisting of interlocking lines often forming zigzag
designs, as seen on the back of Figures 20-22, also
are a characteristic feature of the Late Prehistoric
painted pebbles (Davenport and Chelf 1941:Plates
II, 4b, 12a, b). The imagery displays characteristics
of the Late Prehistoric Bold Line Geometric Style
of rock art which also is characterized by intersecting straight lines forming lattices, zigzags, and

use of bold colors (e.g., Turpin 1995:543-550; also

The polished pebble in Figure 20 shows a
cross band design on the back also occurring on
Figure 14 (See Davenport and Chelf 1941:Plate
I-12). The geometric designs (on front and back)
as seen on Figure 22 are quite unusual. It is probable that anthropomorphic imagery was present
on the broken sections not recovered. Similarities in execution also suggest the pebbles shown
in Figures 21-22 were painted by the same artist.
One pebble, identical in execution to the pebble
shown in Figure 22, was recovered from the
Coontail Spin Shelter (41VV82) located on the
north wall of the Rio Grande above Comstock
(Nunley et al. 1965). Occupation of this large site
also dates to the Late Prehistoric period. Closer to
41VV2079 at Eagle Cave (Ross 1965) and Shumla
Caves (see Davenport and Chelf 1941:XIII:17a
and b; and XI: 3a -b; Jackson 1938: CCXXXII),
two other broken pebbles were recovered that
display similar geometric imagery. Ross (1965)
also shows a broken pebble from the McNutt
Collection that features the distinctive imagery.

Future examinations of the painted pebble collections may yield similar examples suggesting
the movement of people within a prescribed area.

Little was known about the Lower Pecos region
in the early 1930s when Ted Sayles initiated his
ambitious excavations at 41VV2079. Like other archeologists of his time, Sayles focused his attention
on developmental sequences, often with research

culture on another, either through trade or migration.
As stated in the introduction, his intentions were to

Lower Pecos to the cultures of the Southwest. His
subsequent 1935 publication, The Archaeology of

combines archeological materials from 41VV2079
with those of the other two sites he excavated on
Mile Canyon, 41VV167 and 41VV164.

Sayles’ 1932 excavation notes of 41VV2079
(1932) are sketchy and do not provide information
about the context of the painted pebbles in relation
WR?RWKHU?UHFRYHUHG?PDWHULDOV??:KDW?LV?VLJQLÀFDQW?LV?
that he did recover well-preserved painted pebbles
in such a small, shallow rock shelter, all apparently
painted by a long tradition of artists from the Middle
Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. Deposits from the
shelter suggest short-term occupation by small
groups, perhaps extended families, to take advantage
of seasonally available resources near the spring fed
creek below. It is probable that these groups traveled
between the tributary river canyon sites in this area,
and joined larger aggregations at sites such as Eagle
Cave (41VV 167) in nearby Mile Canyon to exchange information and facilitate mating networks.
Microscopic examination, as illustrated in this
study of the pebbles from 41VV2079, has great
potential in the future for a comparison of artistic
styles between sites not only in the application of
SDLQWHG?LPDJHV?EXW?RWKHU?SUHIHUHQFHV?LQ?PRGLÀFDtions of the stone and selection of designs that may

We cannot assume that the Lower Pecos region
was an insular area for certainly there were important mechanisms in place to drive human exploration and interaction. Of importance is the fact, that
unlike more permanent parietal art, the painted
pebbles had the potential to be moved around and
thus carry more intimate meanings to different audiences The Rio Grande was a logical channel of
FRPPXQLFDWLRQ?DV?LW?ÁRZHG?WR?WKH?JXOI??HPSRZHUHG?
by a number of tributaries in the Southwest area of
New Mexico and northern Mexico stretching from

Coahuilteco to Tamaulipeco and ultimately to the
Tarahumara and Tepehuane. Demographic pressure
for a small group to survive within a territory of
VHDVRQDO?URXQGV?DQG?WKH?QHHG?WR?ÀQG?VXLWDEOH?PDWHV?
would have been a compelling reason for exploration and interaction between local communities.
It is obvious that the painted pebble tradition
was a widespread, long-term phenomenon that
despite evolutionary changes, continued to play an
integral role in the worldview of the Lower Pecos
people. Women, if moving from one group to another through mating networks, perhaps did not always
transport the pebbles, but certainly carried recall of
the myths and rituals imbedded in history and landscape and continued to gather in the rock shelters to
recreate these legacies through the magic of paint in
gendered rituals. The longevity of the painted pebble
tradition suggest that it may have served as a porWDEOH?H[SUHVVLRQ?RI?WKH?´P\WKRORJLFDO?FKDUWHUµ?RI?WKH?
Lower Pecos people, like a passport to travel across
time to their origins (e.g., Malinowski 1954:113).
In conclusion, although the archeological
record of 41VV2079 was compromised in many
ways, the people who lived here in the Lower Pecos and painted the pebbles have left subtle brush
strokes of history to lead us in new directions. Ultimately, detailed and continued recordation of the
painted pebble collections may permit additional

In September 2007, a previously unrecorded upland burned rock midden site, the Lost Midden site (41VV1991),
was encountered during construction activities near the Visitor’s Center at Seminole Canyon State Park and
Historic Site, Val Verde County, Texas. Subsequent mitigation measures included the excavation of 18 1 x 1 m
test units, as well as several shovel tests and mechanical auger tests. These excavations showed that the site,

diagnostic projectile points and projectile point fragments, including both dart points and arrow points. The
projectile points and eight radiocarbon assays indicate that the site was utilized between approximately 1300
and 690 years ago, during the Flecha subperiod of the Late Prehistoric period and very late in the Blue Hills

were the likely food sources roasted at the site, while a wide variety of plants were utilized as fuel sources. The
location of the intact roasting pit in an area protected from southerly winds may suggest that roasting events
were conducted in the spring to early summer, when prevailing winds are from the southeast. If so, it is possible
that the site served as a warm weather kitchen for inhabitants of nearby rockshelters.

In September 2007, despite at least three separate archeological surveys that included the upland
project area, and several previous impacts to the
project area, a previously unrecorded burned rock
midden site—the Lost Midden site (41VV1991)—
was encountered by a Texas Department of Transportation contractor while conducting a backhoe
excavation for a recreational vehicle dump station
at Seminole Canyon State Park and Historic Site,
Val Verde County, Texas (Figures 1-2; Roberts and
Alvarado 2011).
Following the accidental site discovery, the
senior author traveled to the site and conducted
a series of shovel tests (n=9) at 5 m intervals in
cardinal directions from the open backhoe pit to
try to determine its size. Based on the presence
of cultural material (burned rock) in only one of
the shovel test excavations east of the backhoe
excavation, the site appeared at that time to consist of a single burned rock midden, measuring

approximately 22 m north-south by 16 m east-west
and encompassing about 0.04 hectares. Roughly
23.8 m2 of the estimated 359.4 m2 site, or about 6.6
percent, was impacted by construction activities.
Park staff and volunteers screened over 50 percent of the backdirt from the backhoe excavation,

including Rabdotus dealbatus and Polygyra texasiana, were also recovered. Burned rock was also

In November 2007, Roberts, park staff, and
volunteers, excavated a series of 29 mechanical auger tests across the site area and beyond. Thirteen
of the auger tests had chipped stone debitage and
debris, as well as burned rock. These tests also reVXOWHG?LQ?WKH?LGHQWLÀFDWLRQ?RI?DQ?DGGLWLRQDO?EXUQHG?

of approximately 15 m by a maximum east-west
dimension of about 26 m.
At this early stage of the project, no diagnostic projectile points were recovered from the Lost
Midden site; however, end scrapers were found
and are known to be one of the diagnostic artifact
classes that typify Late Prehistoric Flecha subpeULRG? ?????????%?3? ?DQG?,QÀHUQR?SKDVH?RU?LQWHUYDO?

kind of upland settings as the Lost Midden site.

Burned rock midden sites are not uncommon
in the Lower Pecos or surrounding regions (see
Black et al. 1997:91; Dering 2002:6.3), but these
sites, unlike the Lost Midden site, are often found
exposed on the surface of stable upland landforms
and the materials recovered from these sites are
very difficult to temporally separate (Dering
2002:6.4). Furthermore, burned rock midden sites

that date to the Late Prehistoric period or include
a Late Prehistoric component are relatively rare
in the Lower Pecos in comparison to those dating
to the Middle or Late Archaic periods (cf. Dering
2002:5.8). Because of the buried context of the
Lost Midden site, and the preliminary assessment
that it contained Late Prehistoric deposits, the site
showed considerable potential to contribute important information about the Late Prehistoric tradition
in the Lower Pecos.
As a result of the apparent research potential
of the Lost Midden site and the damage that was
done during construction activities, the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department, in coordination with
the Texas Historical Commission, pursued mitigation of the site. Mitigation included extensive
excavations, geomorphological and paleobotaniFDO?VWXGLHV??DQG?RWKHU?DQDO\VHV??7KH?ÀHOGZRUN?IRU?

Located within the 880 hectares Seminole
Canyon State Park and Historic Site, in southern
Val Verde County, Texas, the Lost Midden site is
situated in the northeastern Chihuahuan Desert.
The landscape in the area is characterized by narrow drainageways that have eroded and deeply dissected the uplifted and inclined limestone bedrock
in the region, creating steep canyon walls in many
places (Cliff et al. 2003:3).
Among the most interesting aspects of the Lost
Midden site is its physiographic and geomorphic
context. The site is situated almost entirely within

on what today is a relatively level upland summit
near the western wall of Seminole Canyon, at an
elevation of about 422 m amsl. The process by
which the basin formed remains uncertain, but it
may represent a partially collapsed sinkhole. The

basin could also represent a tinaja, but it lacks the
characteristic form and smoothed surfaces of most
IHDWXUHV?RI?WKLV?W\SH?LQ?WKH?DUHD??7KH?EHGURFN?ÁRRU?
of the basin, which was partially exposed by the
backhoe excavation, is approximately 1.2 m below
the present ground surface and is nearly level. The
sides of the basin are more irregular and marked
by occasional calcium carbonate ‘bubbles.’ These
bubbles, which are ca. 1 m in diameter and rise up
to within about 0.5 m below the present ground
surface, were subsequently tested by project geomorphologist Ed Hajic. Test results showed these
natural features to be small algal mounds (Ed Hajic, personal communication, October 22, 2009).
These algal mounds were formed by calcareous
Halimeda macroalgae when the area was covered
by a sea during the Cretaceous period. This suggests that the basin formation, within which the
Lost Midden site is situated, has considerable age.
Within the natural basin, the sediment sequence consists of two soil strata that extend to a

maximum depth of approximately 1.2 m (Figure
3). The lower strata consists of dark brown granuODU?WR?ÀQH?JUDYHO?VLOW\?FOD\?WR?KHDY\?ORDP??6DQG?LV?

The contact between the two sediment units at
the Lost Midden site is clear to abrupt, and somewhat masked by soil formation and likely cultural

and there is a paucity of whole snail shells. A modest amount of charcoal is dispersed throughout
the upper deposits; only a few fragments were
encountered in the lower part beneath the cultural

Following preliminary testing, and a geomorphological assessment by the project geomorphologist, the remaining overburden that mantled
the Lost Midden site was removed. Most of the
soil that mantled the site was removed by heavy
equipment prior to the backhoe excavation of
the original midden as part of the preparation for
constructing the proposed recreational vehicle

dump station. As a result, only a thin layer of soil
remained across the site. This soil was removed
by hand troweling and shovel skimming in order
to fully expose the cultural features and any living
surfaces that may have been present.
Upon removing this soil and fully exposing the
two burned rock middens, the plan view of the site
was thoroughly documented through conventional
digital photography and low altitude aerial digital
photography (i.e. kite photography and blimp
photography; Figure 5). A base map of the site
was also completed, using a total data station and
stadia rod, and Surfer PC software. Eighteen 1 x 1
m units were subsequently placed within the fully
revealed cultural features and other areas of the
site (Figure 6). Investigations at the Lost Midden
site, including the unit excavations, revealed the
two previously noted burned rock middens and an
intact roasting pit (Feature 3) discovered within the
original burned rock midden (Feature 1).

Fourteen 1 x 1 m units were excavated within

determined, in part, by the remaining intact areas of
Feature 1, the nature of these areas in relationship
to the overall burned rock midden, the abundance
of cultural material in these areas, evidence of other possible cultural features, and the geomorphological setting. This distribution of units provided
a good cross-section of Feature 1, and resulted in
the discovery of an intact roasting pit (Feature 3)
in the southeastern part of the midden.
Feature 1 is amorphous in shape, and has a
maximum north-south dimension of 10 m by 12.5
m east-west. The maximum depth of this feature is
approximately 57 cm bs, but the base of the feature
is uneven. The average depth of Feature 1 is approximately 45 cm bs. The area of Feature 1 immediately surrounding Feature 3, an intact earth oven,
is reminiscent of a singular ring midden. However,
the large, amorphous nature of the broader Feature
1, and the presence of Transitional Archaic dart
points and Late Prehistoric arrow points within this

feature (see below), suggests that Feature 1 may
actually represent remnants of multiple ring middens or crescent middens. While the radiocarbon
dates for this feature (Table 1) all fall within the
Late Prehistoric Flecha subperiod (1380-510 B.P.),
they may still represent at least two use episodes. If
Feature 1 does actually represent multiple burned
rock middens, it was not readily apparent within

Charred wood or leaf bases were collected

D?VHFRQGDU\?GHFRUWLFDWLRQ?ÁDNH?RI?(GZDUGV?FKHUW??
The boundaries of this feature were subsequently
exposed during the removal of the overlying soil.
Five units were excavated within Feature 2
(Test Units 1-5). The units were placed to create a
contiguous east-west trench across the feature (see
Figure 6). The units provided a good cross-section
of the feature, which was situated on a slight slope
adjacent to the natural basin within which Feature
1 is located. The unit excavations showed that there
was no central pit associated with Feature 2; it is
possible, however, that a pit was located somewhere
within the natural basin, adjacent to this midden.
Feature 2 is a smaller and somewhat more
conical or dome-shaped burned rock midden in
comparison to Feature 1. This feature is situated
on the southwestern edge of the basin. As noted,
much of this midden appears to be located just outside the basin, upon gently east-sloping bedrock.
There is little actual accumulation of burned rock
at the summit of the landform, and no evidence of
a pit in the center of the feature or elsewhere in
the immediate vicinity. This feature measures 7 m
north-south by 6.5 m east-west, and has an estimated maximum depth of approximately 30 cm in
its eastern half. Midden deposits thin as one moves
from east to west across the feature. Radiocarbon
dates for Feature 2 indicate that this feature dates
to the Flecha subperiod of the Late Prehistoric
tradition (Table 5).

Feature 3, an intact rock-lined roasting pit
(Figure 9), was encountered while excavating Test
Units 5, 6, 13, and 14 within Feature 1. Oval in
shape, Feature 3 measures 1.4 m north-south by
1.04 m east-west (see Figure 6). All boundaries

vertical alignments of burned tabular limestone
measuring less than 24 cm in length, while the
interior of the feature was composed of both tabular and nodular limestone rocks of the same size.
Basin shaped, its cross section is approximately 16
cm thick along its edges and approximately 24 cm
thick near the center of the basin.
The upper portion of Feature 3 originated in
the gray matrix observed across the site, while the
basin appears to have been partially dug into the
orange subsoil. Limestone bedrock underlies the

feature; excavations suggest a dip or downward
trend in the bedrock toward the northwest. In Unit
13, bedrock was contacted at ca. 30 cm bs, while
bedrock is visible in the dump station trench adjacent to Unit 5 at ca. 85 cm bs. Feature elevations
indicate that the highest point of the feature was
located in the southeast quadrant (48 cm bs) and
dips slightly to the northwest (52 cm bs). Feature
3 likely followed the natural contour or dip in the
limestone bedrock/caliche located beneath it.

of FCR in Feature 3 is probably the result of the

roasting episode, or perhaps it was left intact in
anticipation of future use. FCR in the vicinity of
Feature 1 represent the refuse from repeated use of
Feature 3 and other possibly undiscovered rocklined baking pits.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from Feature 3. Four radiocarbon dates
for this feature all date to the Flecha subperiod of
the Late Prehistoric period, between 930-690 cal.

A total of 11 temporally diagnostic artifacts,
all of which were projectile points, were recovered
from the Lost Midden site during the present
investigations. These artifacts included both dart
points and arrow points, ranging in age from the
Blue Hills subperiod of the Terminal or Transitional
Archaic (2360-1360 B.P.) to the Late Prehistoric
Flecha subperiod (1380-510 B.P.). All of the
projectile points were from Feature 1 or backdirt
associated with Feature 1, which consisted of the
larger, dispersed burned rock midden at the site.

the Late Prehistoric Flecha subperiod. However,
a separate radiocarbon sample from Feature 1 that
was submitted by the project geomorphologist,

of 1300-1170 B.P. Nonetheless, this date range also
falls within the Flecha subperiod, albeit the earlier

part of the subperiod. The date range for Feature

middens became common in the region from the
latter part of the Late Archaic period, after 2310 B.P.
(Hester 1989a).
The radiocarbon dates from Feature 1 and Feature 3 suggest that little or no mixing of cultural
components has occurred within these features.

dart points recovered from the site, including one
Darl point and one Ensor point, were curated from
elsewhere and brought onto the site, or that the age
range of these points extends well into the Late
Prehistoric (cf. Turner and Hester 1999:101, 114).
Such was recently suggested as a result of excavations at the J. B. White site in Milam County,
Texas (Gadus et al. 2006), and at the McKinney
Roughs site in Bastrop County, Texas (Carpenter
et al. 2006). The deepest levels of the J. B. White
site, which were dated to about 1360 B.P., produced several Darl points as well as Scallorn arrow
points. The occurrence of these points together in
this intact context likely represents a period of transition from use of the atlatl and dart to the bow and
arrow, a scenario that also appears probable at the
Lost Midden site. At the McKinney Roughs site,
Darl points were recovered from an occupation
zone that was radiocarbon-dated to 850-900 B.P.,
well into the Late Prehistoric period.
As noted, no temporally diagnostic artifacts
were recovered from Feature 2, the smaller,
somewhat more conical burned rock midden. True
dome-shaped middens have generally been considered earlier than ring or crescent-shaped middens
in the Lower Pecos, dating to the Middle Archaic
period or earlier (Cliff et al. 2003:37). However,
two charcoal samples recovered from Feature 2
produced calibrated radiocarbon dates ranging
between 1170-920 B.P. Again, this date range falls
within the Late Prehistoric Flecha subperiod.

It appears that the initial occupation of the site
occurred approximately 1300-1170 years ago in the
area of Feature 1. Amorphous in shape, this midden
has a maximum north-south dimension of 10 m by
12.5 m east-west. The maximum depth of Feature
1 is approximately 57 cm bs, but averages approximately 45 cm bs. Because of the large, amorphous
nature of Feature 1, it is possible that it actually
represents remnants of more than one ring midden

Feature 3, an intact earth oven, is reminiscent of
a ring midden, and adheres to Black and Creel’s

Feature 1 is situated within a 1.2 m deep soilÀOOHG?QDWXUDO?EDVLQ??SRVVLEO\?UHVXOWLQJ?IURP?D?SDUWLDOO\?
collapsed sinkhole. The sediment within the basin
accumulated as a combination of eolian and local
colluvial depositional episodes. Because the base
of burned rock midden deposits at Feature 1 is at 45
cm bs, it appears that the natural basin was perhaps
QRW?HQWLUHO\?ÀOOHG?ZLWK?VRLO?E\?WKH?WLPH?RI?WKH?LQLWLDO?
occupation of the site. As a result, the location may
have retained moisture, perhaps even some standing
water, following storms (today, the nearest permanent
source of water is Seminole Watering Hole, a spring
located about 370 m northeast of the Lost Midden
site). The presence of soil and prolonged moisture
may have provided an environmental niche where
vegetation differed in abundance, foliage, or possibly
even diversity compared to the surrounding area.
Such characteristics could have provided a visual clue
even during drier times of the year to the presence of

the construction of earth ovens.
Following the initial occupation of the Lost
Midden site, its use appears to have moved to or
expanded to the perimeter of the basin area between 1170-920 years ago. Feature 2, a smaller,
somewhat more conical or dome-shaped burned
rock midden in appearance, is situated on the
southwestern edge of the basin. In fact, much of
this midden appears to be located just outside the
basin, upon gently east-sloping bedrock. There is
little actual accumulation of burned rock at the
summit of the landform, and no evidence of a pit in
the center of the feature or elsewhere in the immediate vicinity of Feature 2. This feature measures 7
m north-south by 6.5 m east-west, and has an estimated maximum depth of approximately 30 cm bs.

940-690 years ago. Feature 3, an intact rock-lined
roasting pit in the southeast portion of Feature 1,
also dates to this occupation. The upper portion of
the roasting pit originated in the gray matrix in this
area of the site, and had similar soil characteristics;

as a result, the exact boundaries of this portion of

excavations. However, the lower portion of the pit
was very obvious; it was partially excavated into
the subsoil and lined with both tabular and nodular
limestone rocks. Limestone bedrock underlies Feature 3 and excavations suggest a dip or downward
trend in the bedrock toward the northwest. The plan
view of this feature is oval-shaped, and measures
????P?QRUWK?VRXWK?E\??????P?HDVW?ZHVW??,Q?SURÀOH??
the roasting pit is basin-shaped and the readily

basin—is 24 cm in thickness. One scatter of burned
rock in the southeast part of Feature 1, adjacent to
Feature 3, appears to include burned rocks that are
generally smaller than those from the remainder
of Feature 1 and may represent a distinct cleaning
episode of fragmented rock from Feature 3. At
the time of its discovery, Feature 3 had not been
FOHDQHG?RI?WKH?URFNV?IURP?LWV?ÀQDO?XVH?DV?D?URDVWLQJ?
pit. Perhaps the rocks were left in place by the site’s
inhabitants in anticipation of returning and re-using
the roasting pit, or possibly this was the result of a
hasty abandonment of the site. Because of the large
amorphous nature of Feature 1, and the prevalence
of dark gray midden soil across the remnants of this
feature, it is likely that additional roasting pits were
associated with this burned rock midden.
Most of the artifacts recovered from the Lost
Midden site were found on or within the cultural
features of the site. Only sparse amounts of artifacts were recovered from the surrounding area.
This pattern may be the result of tasks focused
within or immediately adjacent to the burned rock
middens, but the paucity of material outside the
middens may have also resulted from the gathering
of soil in these areas in order to cap the earth ovens
and the subsequent disposal of dirt adjacent to the
roasting pits when the roasting process was completed. However, one might anticipate a mixing
of radiocarbon dates as a result of such a process,
which was not the case.

to protect the food contents from being burned by
the underlying hot rocks and coals, and from the

would have been gathered from within the adjacent
canyons, while the other species were available on
the surrounding uplands.
As reported by Leslie Bush (2009), many of
the woody plants recovered from the site have
uses other than fuel sources, although these uses
are probably less likely in the context of burned
rock middens. Several of the trees and bushes from
which wood was recovered, including oaks, elbowbush, condalia, lotebush, mesquite, agarito, and
sumac, provide edible fruits (Tull 1987). Agarito
roots and branches also make a brilliant yellow
dye. Bumelia and one species of condalia, C. hookeri, have fruits that can be used to make a blue dye
(Tull 1987). The young pads of prickly pear and the
ripe fruits are edible raw; the fruits can also be used
to make a red dye. Sotol and lechuguilla were both
XVHG?IRU?ÀEHUV? 0F*UHJRU???????? ??1RQH?RI?WKHVH?
uses necessarily required the construction and use
of roasting pits.
Conspicuously absent from the woody plants
represented at the site is Texas mountain laurel, a
plant that is not uncommon in the Seminole Canyon

area today and was presumably available to the Late
Prehistoric inhabitants of the area. Perhaps, as suggested by some, the cytisine (the alkaloid in Texas
mountain laurel) content of this particular wood
made the smoke harmful if inhaled or imparted

the smoke produced by Texas mountain laurel was
especially unpleasant or that it affected the taste of
food cooked over it. Two other characteristics of
this wood may contribute to its absence at the Lost
Midden site, however. First, Texas mountain laurel
branches do not readily die and drop from the tree,
as the branches of oak and many other trees do. As
a result, there was rarely any dry Texas mountain
laurel wood available for collection unless a whole
tree died. Second, the wood generates an abundance
of sparks when burned, making it uncomfortable for
people nearby, and increasing the risk of spreading

Because the smaller burned rock midden on the
site, Feature 2, dates to the same general time period
as Features 1 and 3 and is located within a few steps
of these features, it seems likely that this midden
was probably used to cook the same types of food.
As noted, evidence of charred prickly pear pads was
recovered from Feature 2; prickly pear pads were
commonly used to protect the food contents in roasting pits and to provide moisture. Feature 2 appears
to be somewhat more conical in shape than Feature
1, but there is no evidence to suggest that this is the
result of a difference in the function of the feature.
Several Tampico pearlymussel (Cyrtonaias
tampicoensis) shells or shell fragments were
recovered from among the two burned rock middens and the roasting pit, and the presence of this
type of mussel is reported from a number of other
sites at Seminole Canyon State Park that include
burned rock middens or burned rock scatters (i.e.
possible remnants of burned rock middens). This
riverine mollusk is still present today in the local waterways, but the closest source to the Lost
Midden site is the Pecos River, three miles west
of the site. It is apparent that a concerted effort
was made to bring these mussels to the site and to
RWKHU?VLWHV?LQ?WKH?DUHD??1RQHWKHOHVV??PRGLÀFDWLRQ?WR?
these mussel shells as a result of food preparation,
cooking, or other uses was noted on only one shell
recovered from Feature 1 that exhibited evidence
of burning. It is unknown whether the shell was
burned intentionally as a result of cooking, or

Roberts and Alvarado—Transitional Cooking Technology in the Lower Pecos 235
whether it was incidental. If intentional, it seems
likely that additional mussel shell specimens would
show evidence of burning. Possibly, the mussels
were eaten raw, or were perhaps boiled, and these
processes, therefore, left no readily apparent signs

among the Rabdotus dealbatus and Polygyra texasiana snail shells. Again, perhaps the snails were

were no concentrations of snail shells on the site,
and many of the shells had holes in them that are
the likely result of natural predation.
Regardless of whether mussels or snails were
consumed by the inhabitants of the Lost Midden
site, it does not appear that roasting was the technique by which they were prepared. The features
at the site were apparently limited to the roasting
of vegetal materials. This is consistent with the
general notion that burned rock middens represent
specialized plant-processing areas (cf. Shafer 1981;
Hester 1989b; Black and Ellis 1997:777-783).

shaping of dart and arrow shafts, was also an
activity that took place at the site.
Although a large part of the chipped stone debitage sample collected from the Lost Midden site is
decorticate that mostly falls into the 11 to 20 mm
size range, the collection is not diagnostic of late
VWDJH?UHGXFWLRQ?DQG?WKH?SURGXFWLRQ?RI?ÀQLVKHG?VWRQH?
tools. Instead, given the large percentage of biface

debitage is generally more indicative of blank and
preform manufacture. Given the ready availability
of local chert resources from erosional exposures
on the Lower Cretaceous Salmon Peak Limestone
DQG? 4XDWHUQDU\? 3OHLVWRFHQH? ÁXYLDWLOH? JUDYHO? GHposits in the uplands of the area, and from gravel
bars once found in the Rio Grande, it is likely that
biface manufacture probably began with naturally
occurring chert nodules. However, given the large
percentage of decorticate debitage, it is possible
that some of the very early stages of lithic reduction occurred on or near the source locales rather
than at the Lost Midden site.

Based on the lithic assemblage recovered from
the Lost Midden, other activities conducted at the
site, in addition to the actual roasting of foodstuffs,
included the preparation of sotol or lechuguilla for

The placement of the Lost Midden site on
the landscape was dictated, at least in part, by the
presence of extensive soil deposits and perhaps
seasonal water and a greater abundance of potential fuel sources resulting from the natural basin
at the site location. The placement of Feature 3
adjacent to the southeast wall of the natural basin
may offer a clue as to intrasite patterning, as well
as possible seasonality at the site. The location of
Feature 3 was optimal for sheltering it (more speFLÀFDOO\??LW?ZRXOG?KDYH?SURWHFWHG?WKH?XVHUV?RI?WKH?

the prevailing southeasterly winds that occur between April and October in the Lower Pecos. The

support warm weather use of the site. Historically,

summer (usually in May and June); this is when
the plants contained the most water and sugar-converting enzymes (Brown 1991:105; Cheatham et
al. 1995:143-144). However, while it is suggested
that the Lost Midden site was perhaps utilized during the late spring or early summer, its use during
warm weather is not certain. The inhabitants could

236

have gathered succulents at any time of the year if
food was scarce, such as has been documented for
the Mescalero Apache (Basehart 1960:10).
No general site distribution pattern was recognized between the major rockshelters at Seminole
Canyon State Park and Historic Site and open
burned rock midden sites such as the Lost Midden
site. It is possible that the Lost Midden site functioned as a ‘summer kitchen’ of sorts for inhabitants of the nearby Fate Bell Shelter or Fate Bell
Annex, keeping the heat generated by the roasting
process out of the otherwise cool rockshelters.
While no association can be determined with
certainty between the occupants of the Lost Midden site and Fate Bell Shelter or Fate Bell Annex,
there are Late Prehistoric pictographs at both of
these rockshelters that could fall within the Flecha
subperiod. Among the rock imagery at Fate Bell
Shelter are Red Linear images, while Red Monochrome style paintings have been noted at Fate Bell

site, including TPWD personnel Rich Mahoney,
Logan McNatt, and Kent Hicks, and former TPWD
employee Todd McMakin. Margaret Howard, also
with TPWD, reviewed a draft copy of the original
report and provided helpful comments and advice.
