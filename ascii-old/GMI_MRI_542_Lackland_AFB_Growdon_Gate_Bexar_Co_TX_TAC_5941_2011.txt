ABSTRACT

An intensive archaeological survey was conducted on three alternative routes for the proposed
relocation of Growdon Gate at Lackland Air Force Base (LAFB) in Bexar County, Texas. The
Proposed Action would consist of a new 2.05 mi-long roadway relocating the Growdon Gate, the
Commercial Vehicle Inspection Area, and Growdon Road east of Leon Creek Flood Zone
Property, and Alternatives 1 and 2 would consist of a new 1.34 mi-long access road built across
the Leon Creek Flood Zone Property from U.S. Highway 90 to Billy Mitchell Road. The
archaeological field investigation involved an intensive archaeological survey with pedestrian
walkover and shovel testing. Trenching was not conducted due to extensive subsurface quarrying
disturbances within areas of mapped Holocene alluvium. The survey resulted in the excavation
of 39 shovel tests and the documentation of 41BX1886, a mid-twentieth-century homestead site,
within and adjacent to the right-of-way (ROW) of the Proposed Action. Given the minimal
information potential associated with this site and lack of integrity due to extensive razing of the
historic structures, site 41BX1886 is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archaeological Landmark. Aside from
41BX1886, no other cultural materials were recovered. As a result, no further investigations are
recommended for the presently defined project area. All materials generated by this project will
be permanently curated at the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at the University of
Texas at San Antonio.

INTRODUCTION

This report presents results of Phase I archaeological investigations by Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI),
conducted on three alternative routes for the proposed relocation of Growdon Gate at Lackland
Air Force Base (LAFB) in Bexar County, Texas (Figure 1). These investigations were conducted
for Weston Solutions, Inc., under contract with the Air Education and Training Command
(AETC) (GMI project # 30401.01.17.02). The purpose of these investigations is to provide the
AETC, with data for use in the management of its cultural resources in partial fulfillment of its
obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (P.L.
96-515, as amended) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. Â§Â§
4321â4347; P.L. 91â190; 83 Stat. 852.
The proposed project involves the relocation of the main gate (Growdon Gate) at LAFB in San
Antonio, Texas. LAFB would consider acquiring land adjacent to the base for the construction of
a new road to the relocated gate. Three alignment alternatives are proposed, the Proposed Action
would consist of relocating Growdon Gate, the Commercial Vehicle Inspection Area, and
Growdon Road east of Leon Creek Flood Zone Property (Figure 2). A new 2.05 mi-long access
road would be built east of the Leon Creek Flood Zone Property. According to Alternatives 1 and
2, Growdon Road would originate from the same location as the Proposed Action, but would be
built across as opposed to around the Leon Creek Flood Zone Property (see Figure 2).
Alternatives 1 and 2 would consist of the same 1.34 mi-long Growdon Road from U.S. Highway
90 to Billy Mitchell Road, but would differ in the locations of the entry gate and inspection point.
For example, the entry gate and inspection point for Alternative 1 would be located north of the
flood zone, whereas the entry gate and inspection point for Alternative 2 would be located south
of the flood zone (see Figure 2). The proposed roadways are approximately 50 feet in width, and
the estimated depths of impacts are approximately 1 meter with deeper impacts occurring at creek
crossings for the installation of bridge support piers.
The Phase I cultural resources survey and archaeological inventory consisted of pedestrian
survey, photodocumentation, and the excavation of 39 shovel tests within the project area of
potential effects (APE). Project personnel for the cultural resources survey included Principal
Investigator Duane Peter, Project Archaeologist Ben Fullerton, and Field Technician Robert
Davis. Fieldwork took place between May 3 and 6, 2011, and was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit #5941. Since land to be acquired Lackland AFB involves property owned by
the City of San Antonio, work was conducted under joint NHPA Section 106/Texas Antiquities
Permit review.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Bexar County includes portions of three physiographic regions: the Edwards Plateau, the
Blackland Prairie, and the Rio Grande Plain (also known as the South Texas Coastal Plain).
Lackland AFB is situated in the Blackland Prairie (Fenneman 1931; Taylor et al. 1991).
The regional physiography is governed primarily by the Balcones Escarpment, a broad area of
faulted limestone forming the southern and eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This
escarpment rises approximately 304.8 meters (m; l,000 feet [ft]) above the coastal prairie that lies
to the south and east. This elevation change has a marked influence on the environmental setting.
The escarpment extends from near Del Rio, on the Texas-Mexican border, about 257.5 kilometers
(km; l60 miles [mi]) eastward, through northern Bexar County, and on to Austin 112.7 km
(70 mi), Temple and Waco to the northeast. This physical feature runs northeast-southwest
through the San Antonio area.
In Bexar County, the Edwards Plateau is northwest of the escarpment and is a rugged, hilly,
dissected region drained by Cibolo and Balcones creeks and contains the headwaters of Culebra,
Leon, and Salado creeks (Taylor et al. 1991:119). Elevations in the Plateau range from 335.4Â­
579.1 m (1,100-1,900 ft). Fenneman (1931) mapped the Edwards Plateau as part of the Great
Plains Province.
To the southeast of the escarpment is the slightly undulating Gulf Coastal Plain Province. Along
the base of the Escarpment is a region classified as the Blackland Prairie physiographic province,
on which Lackland is located (Taylor et al. 1991). The Blackland Prairie is undulating and hilly
with elevations ranging from 213.4-304.8 m (700-1,000 ft). It is drained in part by the San
Antonio River and in part by tributaries of the Medina River and Cibolo Creek (Taylor et al.
1991:119). Sellards (1919) described this physiographic area as part of the Taylor-Navarro Plain.
Much of this plain is covered with gravelly terrace deposits composed of limestone and chert.
Some valleys are cut by stream erosion. The Rio Grande Plain is nearly level or undulating
prairie, with elevations ranging from 137.2 to 213.4 m (450 to 700 ft). It is drained by the
Medina and San Antonio rivers and Cibolo Creek as well as their tributaries (Taylor et al.
1991:119).

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The bedrock that underlies Lackland AFB is mapped by Barnes (1983) as being Upper
Cretaceous undivided Navarro Group and Marlbrook Marl overlain with Pliocene-aged Uvalde
gravel and/or Quaternary (Pleistocene and Recent) stream deposits. The Navarro/Marlbrook
formation is composed of marl, clay, sandstone, and siltstone, with concretions of siderite and
siliceous limestone. The Uvalde gravel, found on hills and ridges, is composed of calicheÂ­
cemented boulders of limestones and chert measuring up to one foot in diameter. Well-rounded
cobbles of chert, but also smaller proportions of quartz, limestone, and igneous rock, comprise
these gravels. The chert cobbles derive from the Edwards Limestone formation of Lower
Cretaceous age. Nordt (1997:12-19) recognizes two alluvial terraces in the Medio and Leon
Creek valleys. Within the narrow incised flood plain, the T2 terrace is about 6 m above the
modern stream channel and contains undated deposits thought to predate 5,000 B.P. (before
present). An episode of down-cutting occurred by 5,000 B.P. and the subsequent deposition
created the T1 terrace, which extends about 2 m above the modern channel and dates 5,000 to
2,000 years ago. Some sediments from the active flood plain (T0) are inset against and lie atop
the T1 terrace. These sediments date less than 2,000 B.P.
Soils within the project area belong to the Lewisville-Houston Black association and the VenusÂ­
Frio-Trinity association. The Lewisville-Houston Black association contains level, deep,
calcareous clayey soils developing in old calcareous alluvium. The lowest deposits in this
association occur along rivers and streams where soils have washed down from adjacent uplands.
The deep, calcareous clay loam of the Venus-Frio-Trinity association is found in the bottomland
and low terraces along rivers, major streams, and tributaries. The potential for buried
occupational horizons is significantly greater in these soil associations that have formed in
alluvial deposits. Five specific soil mapping units were found within the project area (Figure 3):

Patrick soils, rarely flooded
Pits and Quarries, 1 to 90 percent slopes

CLIMATE
Bexar County is located on the western edge of the Gulf Coastal Plain resulting in a modified
subtropical climate, predominantly continental during the winter months and marine during the
summer months (Taylor et al. 1991: 118). The summer is hot, with daily maximum temperatures
above 32.2Â° Celsius (C; 90Â° Fahrenheit [F]) over 80 percent of the time. Normal mean
temperatures range from a low of 16.8Â° C (62.3Â° F) in January to a high of 34.6Â° C (94.2Â° F) in
August. Mild weather prevails during much of the winter months, with below-freezing
temperatures occurring on an average of about 20 days each year. Relative humidity averages
about 80 percent during the early morning hours most of the year, dropping to near 50 percent in
the late afternoon.
San Antonio is situated between a semi-arid area to the west and the humid coastal area with
heavy precipitation to the southeast. The average annual rainfall of 70.8 centimeters (cm; 27.89
inches [in]) is sufficient for the normal production of most crops. Precipitation is evenly
6

distributed throughout the year, with heaviest amounts falling during May (20.9 cm [8.22 in]) and
September (40.0 cm [15.78 in]). Precipitation from April through September usually occurs as
thunderstorms that produce large amounts falling in short periods. Most of the winter
precipitation occurs as light rain or drizzle. Moisture laden air from the Gulf of Mexico crossing
the Balcones Escarpment is orographically lifted, causing periodic severe rainfall intensities.
Because of its proximity to the Gulf, storms of a tropical nature also occur, bringing high winds
and prolonged rainfall. Thunderstorms and heavy rainfalls have occurred in all months of the
year. Hail of damaging intensity seldom occurs, but light hail occurs frequently with the
springtime thunderstorms. Measurable snow occurs only once in three or four years.
Northerly winds prevail during most of the winter, while southeasterly winds from the Gulf of
Mexico prevail during the summertime and for long periods during the winter near the surface.
However, winds in the upper levels (1,000 m [3280.8 ft]) are primarily from the south. Rather
strong northerly winds occasionally occur during the winter months with âblue northersâ. No
tornadoes of any consequence had been recorded in the immediate area until 17 September l988
when an estimated l0 to 12 tornadoes associated with Hurricane Gilbert (a Class 5 hurricane)
struck the area.
Though low stratus clouds of orographic origin are common in the evening, these clouds are
burned off by the sun during the daytime hours. San Antonio receives about 50 percent of the
possible sunshine in the winter and over 70 percent in the summer months. Skies are clear about
35 percent of the time, cloudy about 30 percent and partly cloudy about 35 percent of the time.
Average annual evaporation for the period 1907-1930 was 174.2 cm (68.60 in), or almost two and
a half times the annual precipitation (Dougherty 1975).

FLORA AND FAUNA
Bexar County is situated at the ecotonal transition between three biotic regions. Therefore, the
plants and animals are a mixture of three zones: the Balconian (associated with the Edwards
Plateau), the Texan (associated with the Blackland Prairie), and the Tamaulipan (associated with
the South Texas Coastal Plain). The flora and fauna of each region is represented to varying
degrees in the San Antonio area (Blair 1950).
The land that is now Lackland AFB was originally part of the Blackland Prairie Biome, although
some South Texas Plains and Edwards Plateau biota may find their way into the area. Because of
this ecotonal setting, the original vegetation was likely quite diverse and abundant. Texas
wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), and panic grass (Panicum
sp.) are considered the dominant climax species, while other grasses such as big bluestem
(Andropogon gerardi), Indian grass (Sorghastrum avenaceum), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum),
and side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) also would be found. In addition to the grasses are
a wide variety of wildflowers including Indian blanket (Gaillardia pulchella), upright prairie
coneflower (Ratibida columnaris), coreopsis (Coreopsis sp.) and Drummond skullcup
(Scutellaria drummondii). Along the waterways, such as Leon Creek, were woodlands consisting
of cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), live oak (Quercus virginiana), netleaf hackberry (Celtis
reticulata), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), and pecan (Carya illinoinensis). In addition,
Black willow (Salix nigra), boxelder (Acer negundo), and American sycamore (Plantanus
occidentalis) are associated with live oak and pecan along Leon Creek. Dominant vegetation
found on the uplands of the Annex lands includes mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and huisache.
8

The original prairie supported herds of bison (Bison bison), antelope (Antilocapra Americana),
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), peccary (Pecari angulatus), and numerous game birds. The
urbanization of the area has caused most of the larger and more sensitive animals to vacate. The
present fauna can be divided into two regimes: those inhabiting the urbanized portion and those
inhabiting the Leon and Medio Creek bottomlands. Urban tolerant animal and bird species
include fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), English sparrows (Spizella sp.), rusty blackbirds (Euphagus
carolinas), grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus), mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos), robins (Turdus
migratorius), and chickadees (Poecile sp.). The bottomlands of Leon and Medio Creeks form a
more protected habitat for wilder species. Beaver (Castor canadensis), armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), skunks (Mephitis mephitis), cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.), and opossums
(Didelphis virginiana) inhabit the bottomlands. The number of bird species that visit bottomlands
of Bexar County also may be high. Black bullheads (Ictalurus melas), mosquitofish (Gambusia
affinis), sailfin molly (Poecillia latipinna), warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), bluegill (Lepomis
macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), Rio Grande perch (Cichlasoma
cyanoguttatum) as well as introduced species of mouthbrooders may inhabit the Leon Creek
wetlands. Also occurring are a large number of frogs, toads, salamanders and such reptiles as
lizards and snakes.

PALEO-ENVIRONMENT
The environmental conditions presently found in Bexar County and Lackland AFB represent
relatively recent conditions arising from climatic oscillations and reaction to the historic
introduction of domesticated animals by the Hispanic people during the past 300 years. Current
studies indicate that in prehistoric times spanning the past 12,000 years of human existence, the
region experienced changes in the environmental conditions. Reconstruction of these past
conditions is of interest to archaeologists, since those conditions provide a context for interpreting
environmental constraints that affected decisions the ancient people made about subsistence
patterns and technological innovations used to convert natural materials into usable aspects of
their culture.
Detailed reconstruction of past environments is not possible, but there are many lines of evidence,
called proxies, that are useful in reconstructing these past conditions. Such proxies can be
grouped into three general classes comprised of geological, floral and faunal remains. The
geological proxies include delineation of periods of stream valley filling, stability and erosion; the
mass erosion of upland deposits; rates of sedimentation; and carbon isotope studies of soils. The
floral proxies are derived from preserved macrobotanical studies of plant parts (seeds and wood
identifications, and cell growth structure variability in wood, etc.), and microbotanical plant parts
(pollen and phytolith identifications, etc.). The faunal proxies are derived from the identification
of animal bones, terrestrial and aquatic snails, insects, and ostracodes, and deriving inferences
about their preferred habitat conditions.
A critical component to reconstructing past
environments is the absolute dating of the proxy event, and the recognition that some lines of
evidence respond more rapidly to changes in the environment than other lines of evidence (Caren
1998). The scale of investigations is also difficult to control, since sometimes, isolated habitats
persist in special niches when changes are occurring all around. Thus, different kinds of proxies
are apt to provide various degrees of resolution. For these reasons, the reconstruction of the
paleoenvironmental conditions sometimes seems to be contradictory. The precision in defining
the magnitude wet-dry, and warm-cool cycles is generalized, at best. Nevertheless, there seems
to be general regional trends discernable. Much of the following is derived from syntheses
developed by Decker et al. (2000), Collins (1995); Ellis et al. (1995); Johnson and Goode (1994).
9

Late Pleistocene
The last glacial advance in North America began to wane approximately 25,000 years ago.
Although the ice sheets never extended farther south than the area of South Dakota, the
environmental conditions were generally regarded as being much cooler and wetter than at
present (Bryant and Holloway 1985). Even though there was no glacial melts near south Texas,
there was quite likely considerable erosion of the various riverbeds through the region, including
the Colorado and Pedernales with subsequent aggrading channels filled with coarse gravels and
cobbles prior to 13,000 years ago (Blum 1989, 1992; Blum and Lintz 1993; Blum and Valastro
1992). Comparable creek scouring and gravel accumulations are apt to have occurred in the
Medio and Leon Creeks at Lackland (Nordt 1997).
Pollen records from south Texas suggests that prior to 14,000 years ago, parklands and scrub
grasslands was present on the southern High Plains, pinyon-juniper woodlands were extant in the
Trans-Pecos region and spruce-fir woodlands existed in central Texas (Bryant and Holloway
1985). Over the next few thousand years, pollen and isotope studies suggest that these plant
communities began to be replaced by various grass and shrub species and a marked decline in
spruce that was thought to signal slightly warmer and drier conditions (Bousman 1992, 1994).
Studies of beetle parts preserved in pond sediments of north Texas indicate that between 14,000
and 13,000 years ago, temperatures may have been as much as 10o C cooler than present, and
small mammal remains from Hallâs Cave in Kerr County indicate that the climate was about 6o C
cooler (Elias 1994; Toomey et al. 1993). Against these lines of evidence for cooler environments
is the data on variation in carbon isotope ratios recovered from soils of the Applewhite Reservoir
project, along the Medina River south of San Antonio. Here, Nordt et al. (1994) found evidence
for the relative increase in C4 (warm grasses) in deposits dating between 14,000 to 13,000 and
again in deposits dating between 11,000 and 10,000 B.P. The latter event is sometimes referred to
as the âClovis droughtâ (Haynes 1991). It is presently difficult to interpret the magnitude of these
changes, but the data does reflect that there was the beginning of a relative warming trend that
began during the terminal Pleistocene. It is likely that at some brief point during the period
10,000 to 9,000 B.P. the cool-moist climate of the Pleistocene briefly passed though an episode of
modern conditions. For after ca. 9,000 B.P. environmental proxies indicate that the region was
warmer and drier than at present.
The end of the Pleistocene saw the extinction of many forms of mammals from the region.
Mammoths, mastodons, camels, horses, and mega-sized bison all became extinct as a result of the
climatic change towards drought. Considerable literature suggests that human preying on these
megafauna species contributed substantially to the passing of these animals. And although clear
associations exist between humans and megafauna during this period, archaeologists still debate
whether humans were slaying these animals or taking opportunistic advantage of some hunting
situations. Systematic screening of Paleo-Indian deposits has documented that most groups
actually utilized a diversified range of resources, including the consumption of rodents, small
mammals and reptiles.

10

Early-Middle Holocene Climatic Conditions
The paleoenvironmental record for the period from 9,000 to perhaps 4,500 B.P. reflects a
prolonged xeric episode that was much warmer and drier than at present (Collins 1995:377). This
period is variously called the altithermal or hypsithermal interval and is characterized as being
global in extent (Antevs 1955a, 1955b; Deevey and Flint 1957). Evidence from the faunal
assemblage at Hallâs cave, as well as glacial data from the southern Rocky Mountains indicate
that there was a period of amelioration in the severity of the warm-dry conditions, suggesting that
the period should be conceived as having a two-stage expression (Benedict 1975, 1979; Toomey
1993).
Geomorphic studies of the Colorado, Brazos and Trinity rivers indicate that the Pleistocene
terraces were eroded by about 9,000 B.P. and that new terraces were under construction during
most of this Early to Middle Holocene record and are truncated by erosion by about 5,000 years
ago (Blum 1989; Collins 1995:Table 2; Ferring 1990; Nordt 1993). In north central Texas, the
Sanger alluvium along the Trinity River (10,946 to 5,600 B.P.) is roughly coeval with the Fort
Hood alluvium along the Leon River tributary of the Brazos River (8,000 to 4,800 B.P.) (Ferring
1990; Nordt 1992). These in turn are comparable to the âEarly-Middle Holocene terraceâ of the
Colorado River (9,000 to 5,000 B.P.) and the 2B/3e horizons (ca. 10,000 to 4,900 B.P.) at Lubbock
Lake (Blum 1989; Blum and Valastro 1992; Johnson 1987).
This second period of entrenchment and terrace construction around 4,500 to 5,000 B.P. coincides
with the later period of the second severe drought (Collins 1995:Table 2). Although the precise
timing of the erosion may not be entirely synchronous, it seems that some differences relate to the
distances of the study areas from the mouths of the rivers. It is probable that a regional climatic
cause underlies the initiation of erosion in these diverse river valleys. Similarly, the rate of
sedimentation entering sinkholes and caves in the uplands around Kerr County during the early
Holocene suggests that the paucity of vegetation cover did little to retard surface erosion from
upland settings and mass down wasting or extensive upland erosion occurred during the interval
8,000 to 5,000 B.P. (Toomey 1993:457; Toomey et al 1993). The rate of surface deflation
suggests that vegetation in Kerr County may have been sparse scrub, rather than constant grass
cover.
Studies from Hallâs Cave also note that between 5,000 and 2,000 B.P. grooved-tooth pocket
gophers were replaced by smooth-tooth pocket gophers and yellow-faced pocket gophers; these
latter two species tend to inhabit shallower sediments composed of clayier and rockier sediments
than those favored by the grooved-toothed gophers (Toomey 1993:459).
The pollen record from places like Boriak and Weakly bogs east of the Balcones escarpment
reveal vegetation cover shifting from woodland at 9,000 B.P. to predominately grassland savannas
with a brief interval of woodlands between 8750 and 7500 B.P. (Bousman 1994). Phytolith
studies along Coleto Creek indicate that the aridity lasted until some 4,500 years ago as expressed
by the presence of grasslands (Robinson 1979). Other studies indicate that xeric conditions lasted
until ca. 3,500 years ago. All lines of evidence taken together indicate that the two-interval
hypsithermal was a period far more arid than at present.

11

Late Holocene Climatic Conditions
The Late Holocene record is a period of climatic fluctuations. Most studies generally suggest that
more mesic conditions prevailed between 3,500 and 1,000 years B.P. During this period, most
rivers in central Texas continue terrace construction unabated, although perhaps at a somewhat
slower rate than the previous period. These new terraces include the Pilot Point alluvium in the
upper Trinity River, the West Range Alluvium at Fort Hood, and the âLate Holocene Terraceâ in
the Colorado River.
Furthermore, the sedimentation rates in Bering Sinkhole and Hallâs Cave suggest a slowing of
erosion, but Toomey (1993:460) thinks that it may be due to the higher incidence of stony
materials in the upland sediments. A number of distinct soils developed towards the end of this
period. These include the Caddo County paleosol of the southern High and Rolling Plains and
the West Fork Paleosol of the Trinity River (Ferring 1990; Hall and Lintz 1984).
With increasing moisture a vegetation succession began, starting with grassland savannas as
represented by phytoliths and pollen (Robinson 1979). The luxuriant growth of grass led to the
expansion of bison and herds thrived across central Texas during the period 4,500 to 2,000 B.P.
(Dillehay 1974). A marked decrease in bison is generally noted in archaeological sites dating
from 2,000 to 1,000 B.P. that may coincide with the establishment of non-grassy vegetation cover
due to elevated moisture stimulating plant succession of species not favored by bison. In the
Texas panhandle, the recovery of remains of prairie voles in deposits dating between 2,000 and
1,000 B.P. provides further evidence of increased moisture.
However, by ca 1,000 to 800 B.P., there is substantial evidence of a rather abrupt return to xeric
conditions across Texas that lasted for about 300 to 500 years. The geomorphic record reflects
the termination of terrace development in many rivers and repetitive deep erosion is noted in
many streams of the Trinity, Brazos, Colorado, and Medina rivers. Herds of bison and antelope
are now common across central Texas, as a further indication of warm and drier conditions
(Dillehay 1974). Phytolith studies from Choke Canyon Reservoir in South Texas and pollen
studies from regional bogs document the presence of plants signaling the return of xeric
conditions (Bousman 1994; Robinson 1979). All lines of evidence indicate that the droughts of
the twelfth century A.D. never matched the intensity of the conditions of the hypsithermal.
By ca. 500 years ago, the climate became more mesic, but the weather became cooler than at
present. Historic records in Europe record this interval as the Neo-Boreal or âLittle Ice Ageâ
(Bryson and Paddoch 1980). Winters were so severe across North America and Europe that
portions of the Great Lakes and many rivers froze. Such hard freezes were not as severe in south
central Texas. Evidence from Texas of the return to mesic conditions is reflected in the oxygen
isotope results obtained from mussel shells from north Texas (Brown 1998), and the expansion of
woodlands in north central Texas. Many of the stream valleys started one final period of terrace
construction. These sediments are variously designated the âunnamed recentâ alluvium along the
Trinity and Colorado rivers, the Ford alluvium at Fort Hood, and Stratum 5A at the Lubbock
Lake site (Blum and Valastro 1992; Ferring 1990; Johnson 1987; Nordt 1993). The development
of modern climatic conditions has only occurred only in the past 150 years. Probably one of the
biggest changes to the environmental conditionsâespecially the biotic community composition
stems from the introduction of sheep, cattle and horses to Texas during the past 300 years. The
intensive grazing on native vegetation has effectively converted many of the grasslands found in
southern Texas to barren, cactus-infested lands that have been largely stripped of ground cover
and sediment (Weniger 1984).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL BACKGROUND

PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Personnel from GMI conducted a records search of archaeological sites, cultural resources
surveys, and maps to identify previously recorded cultural resources surveys and previously
recorded archaeological sites within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the project area. The results of this
research are presented below. Numerous surveys have been conducted within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of
the project area; however, only several encountered archaeological sites. These investigations are
discussed below. No archaeological sites have been recorded within the presently defined project
area.
Six archaeological sites have been previously recorded within 1 mile of the project area:
41BX958, 41BX1061, 41BX1065, 41BX1066, 41BX1107, and 41BX1108.
Site 41BX958 was recorded by GMI in 1991 during a survey for Kelly Air Force Base (KAFB).
The site represents a twentieth century historic site found on an upland surface along the
boundary fence of KAFB. According to historic topographic maps, the structure encountered
during the survey was constructed sometime between 1922 and 1938. The site was recommended
ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
In 1997, a large-scale survey of Lackland AFB and the Lackland Training Annex was undertaken
by the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio
(Nickels et al. 1997). The survey included the investigation of 41BX1061 at the Wherry Housing
area (Raymond 1997) and the intensive shovel testing of four âSpecial Areasâ designed for
development that included sites 41BX1065 and 41BX1066 (Durst 1997). Site 41BX1061
represents a historic sewer line installed in the early 1900s when the base was first acquired. Site
41BX1065 represents a Middle Archaic through Transitional Archaic campsite found within the
upper 55 cmbs at the edge of a large, flat terrace overlooking Leon Creek. Fifty shovel tests, 7 1Â­
x-1-m test units, 7 Gradall trenches, and 2 backhoe trenches were excavated at the site. The test
units encountered sterile deposits at depths ranging from 35 to 62 cmbs. The site was considered
to have moderate to high research potential, but no further work was recommended. It is unclear
if a proposed housing expansion eventually impacted the site. Site 41BX1066 consisted of a
small lithic surface scatter found on top of a flat knoll overlooking Leon Creek. Debitage and
expedient tools comprise the assemblage recovered from the site; however, no diagnostic
materials or features were found.
13

Site 41BX1107 represents an Early to Transitional Archaic lithic quarry site found by CAR
(Nickels et al. 1997). The site was found in an eroding surficial context on a slight slope above
Medio Creek near the 4th green on the Lackland AFB golf course. Artifacts consisted of interior
flakes, thinning flakes, retouched flakes, and an Edgewood point. FCR was also found on the
surface adjacent to the lithic scatter; however, no intact features were found. Site 41BX1108
represents an unknown prehistoric campsite found on the interior of a large meander of Leon
Creek (Nickels et al. 1997). The artifacts were exposed on the surface and included thinning
flakes, FCR, mollusk shell, bone, and debitage. In addition, a presumed burned rock midden of
unknown age was identified. Although impacts from construction and maintenance of the golf
course were observed, future subsurface testing was recommended for both sites.
In 2006, GMI conducted archaeological eligibility testing on several sites located along Leon
Creek: 41BX1061, 41BX1107, and 41BX1108 (Huhnke 2006).
Nine shovel tests placed at 10-m intervals were excavated at 41BX1107. A total of 32 artifacts
was recovered including debitage, a core, and a utilized flake; however, no FCR was recovered.
The vast majority of the artifacts were recovered from the upper 20 cmbs, although some were
recovered between 20 and 50 cmbs. The investigation determined that the sediments containing
the artifacts had been mixed with sand fill and were in secondary context. The site was
recommended ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Seven shovel tests were excavated along two transects at 41BX1108. Numerous flakes were
noted in the upper 60 cmbs and an Early Archaic Guadalupe biface was found between 10 and 20
cmbs. Nearly 200 lithic artifacts were recovered during testing. A shovel test also encountered a
large burned rock feature between 45 and 60 cmbs. It was suggested by the large size of the
cobbles that the cobbles were related to food cooking and not refuse from boiling activities. The
investigations concluded that artifacts at the site may have accumulated on a stable surface. In
sum, the site was determined to have good integrity, intact features, multiple stratified artifact
zones, and preservation of bone and shell. The site was recommended as eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP.
Finally, eligibility testing was also attempted on 41BX1061, a historic sewer line built in the early
1900âs. Unfortunately, the open features at the site were determined to be a safety hazard and
were filled in before additional testing could be conducted. However, as it was determined that
the features at the site were not part of an early historic homestead and considering the lack of
integrity of the sewer system, the site was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Lackland AFB is located within the Central Texas archaeological region as defined by various
archaeologists (Brown et al. 1982; Prewitt 1981; Suhm 1960; Suhm et al. 1954). Cultural periods
associated with this area include Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric (Prewitt [1981, 1985]),
Protohistoric, and Historic, based on chronologies developed by Johnson and Goode (1994),
Johnson (1995), and Collins (1995). Several phases or complexes are attributed by various
authors to each period for Central Texas, but there is considerable debate about the significance
of reality of the various phases.

14

Cultural Periods

Paleo-Indian Period (11,500-8,800 B.P.)
The Paleo-Indian period is the earliest substantiated cultural period in Texas, evidenced across
Central Texas by sites and isolated artifacts. Often characterized by small but highly mobile
bands of foragers that were specialized hunters of Pleistocene megafauna, recent investigations
indicate that these people actually utilized a wider array of resources. Subsistence in this period
included large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse but was probably based more
consistently on smaller animals such as turtles, land tortoises, alligator, mice, badger, and raccoon
(Collins et al. 1989; Story 1990) and presumably also included an array of plants (Collins 1998).
The period can be divided into two temporal divisions, or early and late subperiods. The Early
Paleo-Indian subperiod consists of two temporally distinct cultural assemblages using
predominantly different fluted projectile point styles: Clovis and Folsom. Clovis assemblages
include the diagnostic fluted lanceolate Clovis point, along with engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins 1995; Collins et al. 1992). Clovis component sites
reported in Central Texas include Kincaid Rockshelter (41UV2), Wilson-Leonard (41WM235),
Gault (41WM9), Horn Shelter No. 2 (41BQ46), and Pavo Real (41BX52). Surface finds of
distinctive Clovis points are reported from a number of other localities (Meltzer and Bever 1995).
Folsom tool kits consisted of fluted Folsom points, thin unfluted (Midland) points, large thin
bifaces, and end scrapers that were more conducive to specialized hunting, particularly bison
(Collins 1995:382). Folsom components have been identified at St. Maryâs Hall (41BX229),
Horn Shelter No. 2, Pavo Real and Kincaid Rockshelter sites.
Spanning the end of the early and beginning of the late Paleo-Indian subperiods are several
projectile point styles, including the Plainview, Dalton, and San Patrice points, for which the
temporal, technological, or cultural significance is unclear. The late subperiod is also
characterized by the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Maryâs Hall point styles (Collins 1995).
Climate was trending toward more moderate conditions, and the larger fauna from the previous
period are no longer available. Most of the associated fauna from this subperiod are smaller
animals and deer. The characteristics of the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Maryâs Hall
components are more Archaic-like in that there are burned rock features, though the features
contain less rock and the features are much smaller than in later times.
In contrast to the earlier remains, these Late Paleo-Indian points are associated with extinct (bison
occidentalis) and modern bison (Bison bison) and often occur as surface finds throughout Central
Texas. Horn Shelter No. 2 (41BQ46 [Forrester 1985]), located on the Brazos River in Bosque
County, Hinds Cave (41VV456 [Shafer and Bryant 1977]) in Val Verde County, and WilsonLeonard (41WM235 [Collins 1998]) in Williamson County have yielded subsistence data
indicating that a variety of vertebrate fauna was being consumed by the Late Paleo-Indian
peoples.

15

Archaic Period (8,800-1,200 B.P.)
Toward the end of the Late Paleo-Indian period a great variety of projectile point styles began to
appear. The subsequent Archaic period (8,800-1,200 B.P.) is broadly characterized by stemmed
and side-notched dart points and by the appearance of ground and pecked stone tools. The
subsistence pattern may have become more diffuse, reflective of a greater exploitation of local
environments, with exclusively smaller animals, especially smaller game animals, fish, and wild
plant foods increasing in dietary importance. Like their predecessors, Archaic peoples apparently
continued to follow a nomadic way of life, traveling seasonally to utilize different food resources
in various localities (cf. Weir 1976). In northern and central Bexar County, major occupation
sites are situated on stream terraces. These sites generally consist of a series of burned rock
middens that are frequently buried. Technologically varied quantities of lithic debris and a wide
variety of projectile points suggest that the sites were revisited over several thousands of years
(McGraw and Hindes 1987:47). The Archaic period is generally divided into early, middle, and
late subperiods (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Story 1985). Each subperiod includes several
temporal-stylistic intervals based on diagnostic projectile point styles and associated radiocarbon
assays (Collins 1995).
Early Archaic (8,800-6,000 B.P.) sites are small and tool assemblages are very diverse (Weir
1976:115-122), suggesting that populations were highly mobile and densities low (Prewitt
1985:217). Paleoclimatic conditions of the Early Archaic are usually regarded as warmer and
drier than at present. Concentrations of Early Archaic sites along the southern and eastern
margins of the Edwards Plateau may indicate that the area had more reliable water sources and a
diverse subsistence base. The margins of the Edwards Plateau are ecotonal in character and may
have provided reliable resources during times of environmental stress (Story 1985:31, 34).
Early Archaic sites, such as Loeve-Fox (41WM230), Wilson-Leonard (41WM235), Richard
Beene (41BX831), Sleeper (41BC65), Jetta Court (41TV151), Youngsport (41BL78), Camp Pearl
Wheat (41KR243), and Landslide (41BL85) are usually described as open campsites or lithic
procurement stations. Kincaid Rockshelter (41UV2) is one of only a few rockshelters that occur
in the Edwards Plateau during this period. Lithic procurement site location is determined by the
natural distribution of cherts. Large and varied burned-rock features (Sleeper, Camp Pearl
Wheat, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene), domestic structures (Turkey Bend Ranch [41CC112]),
and caches (Lindner) are also known in the Early Archaic (Collins 1998:64). Three recognized
point styles (Angostura; Early Split Stem [Gower and Jetta]; and Martindale-Uvalde) indicate that
the makers tended to occupy the better-watered eastern part of the Edwards Plateau (Collins
1998:65). Assemblages also include Clear Fork and Guadalupe bifaces, manos, metates,
hammerstones, burins, circular scrapers, and a variety of bifaces. Few burials have been assigned
to this period (Prewitt 1981:77-79; Story 1985:34-35), and settlement/subsistence systems are
hypothesized to have been diffuse, utilizing a variety of resources and frequently shifting the loci
of subsistence activities rather than intensifying the use of any specified resource (Story 1985:39).
The Middle Archaic (6,000-4,000 B.P.) exhibits more numerous and more varied sites than the
preceding Early Archaic. This cultural manifestation is thought to be characterized by a
population increase, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement patterns, economic and social systems, and technology (Prewitt 1985). In addition,
territorial boundaries may have begun to emerge (Story 1985:39). The paleoenvironmental
conditions have ameliorated considerably.

16

Middle Archaic sites are represented by rockshelters, campsites, lithic quarries, and kill sites
(Weir 1976). The burned rock middens that first appeared toward the end of the Early Archaic
became very widespread in Central Texas during the Middle Archaic. Black et al. (1997:9) posit
that burned rock oven middens indicate a reliance on semisucculants, such as yucca hearts, sotol
and agave; other utilized plants include prickly pear and the bulbs of members of the onion or lily
family. Prewitt (1985:222-226) also notes that the abundance of rock middens indicates hot rock
oven cooking of a greater reliance on plant foods, mostly bulbs and tubers, although tool kits still
reflect a strong reliance on hunting. Black et al. (1997:7-8) recognize a variety in burned rock
oven features that reflect geographical distribution. These forms range from the domed, Weir
Type I (Weir 1976) midden found on the eastern Edwards Plateau to the ring-shaped burned rock
midden possessing a central depression found as far west as the Lower Pecos region. Data
concerning mortuary practices are not available except for the end of the Middle Archaic, during
which time cremations have been reported (Prewitt 1981:81). Three point styles are diagnostic of
this subperiod: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis. Bifaces, a variety of scrapers,
unifaces, and grinding stones are also present. Prewitt (1981:73) suggests that the proportion of
projectile points compared to total number of tools (50 percent) is indicative of a balance between
the exploitation of plant and animal resources.
The Late Archaic subperiod (4,000-1,200 B.P.) is characterized by the emergence of new cultural
patterns as well as the intensification of pre-existing ones (Story 1985:45). Coastal marine shells,
used either as ornaments or as raw materials for ornaments, were exchanged with inland groups,
at least on a limited basis, in return for finished lithic tools and/or siliceous raw material (Story
1985:48). Some of these Late Archaic trade networks may have extended east as far as the
Florida panhandle (Hall 1981). The use of burned rock middens throughout the Late Archaic
appears to have been a major part of the subsistence strategy as a decrease in the importance of
hunting, inferred by the low ratio of projectile points in relation to other tools in site assemblages,
may have occurred (Prewitt 1981:74). Bison, which had been absent from the area for most of
the Archaic, were once again available in the region (Dillehay 1974).
Late Archaic sites include rockshelters, campsites, and large cemeteries. The establishment of
these large cemeteries along drainages suggests strong territorial ties by certain groups (Hall
1981; Story 1985:40). In addition to cemeteries (e.g., Orchard [41BX1] and Loma Sandia
[41LK28]; Story 1985:49), isolated flexed burials have been recorded for this period (Prewitt
1981:81-82). Features include basin hearths, arcuate hearths, and mussel shell caches. The lithic
assemblages contain a variety of dart point styles (e.g., Bulverde, Pedernales-Kinney, LangeWilliams-Marshall, Marcos-Montell-Castroville, Ensor-Frio-Fairland, and Darl); Erath, San
Gabriel, and Hare bifaces; gravers; scrapers; a variety of unifaces and bifaces; grinding stones;
and boatstones. Other artifacts include ulna flakers, bone beads and awls, stone and marine shell
gorgets, and freshwater mussel shell pendants (Prewitt 1981:81-82). The use of burned rock
slowed during this period, but did not cease.

Late Prehistoric Period (1,200 to 300 B.P.)
Following the Archaic, the Late Prehistoric period is characterized first by the introduction of the
bow-and-arrow and later by ceramics, probably from the north where they appear at least a half
millennium earlier. The cultural mechanism(s) for the transmission of these technologies is still
unknown (Prewitt 1985:228). The Late Prehistoric in Central Texas is divided into two phases,
the Austin and the Toyah (Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981). The Austin phase (ca. A.D. 800-A.D. 1300)
17

is distinguished by the first appearance of arrow points, specifically, an expanding stem form with
deep corner notches, known as Scallorn and Edwards points. Despite the continuity of an
âoverall subsistence pattern of a mobile, broad-based hunting-gathering traditionâ (McGraw and
Hindes 1987:48), other changes are apparent. A settlement pattern shift from open habitation
sites to rock shelters can be discerned, suggesting that there was a population decline during this
phase (Prewitt 1981; 1985:217). In addition, true cemeteries appear to be widespread (e.g.,
Loeve-Fox; Prewitt 1982). Although the subsistence economy was still heavily dependent on
gathering a variety of plant foods, hunting seems to have increased in importance, as indicated by
an increased ratio of projectile points to other tools and by an increased frequency of deer bones
in midden deposits; but bison are scarce to absent in south Texas during this time (Dillehay 1974;
Prewitt 1981:74, 83). The use of burned rock oven middens for plant food processing continued
(Black et al. 1997; Goode 1991; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). Horticulture came into play very late
in the region, but was of minor importance to the overall subsistence strategy (Collins 1995:385).
Austin phase sites occur on terraces and in rockshelters. In addition to Scallorn-Edwards points,
the artifact assemblage includes Friday bifaces, scrapers, unifaces, grinding stones, painted
stones, ulna flakers, bone awls and beads, and marine shell beads and pendants. Basin-shaped
hearths are present. A series of circular houses with large central rock hearths have been found at
the Graham-Applegate (41LL419) site in Central Texas (http://www.texasbeyondhistory.
net/graham/index). The introduction of Scallorn and Edwards points is often marked by evidence
of violence and conflict, as many excavated burials contain these point tips in contexts indicating
they were the cause of death (Prewitt 1981). Burials, isolated and in cemeteries, consist of
noncremated (flexed or semiflexed) and cremated interments usually associated with habitation
sites (Prewitt 1981:83).
The subsequent Toyah phase (A.D. 1300-1700) is characterized by contracting stem arrow points
(Perdiz), bone-tempered ceramics, small endscrapers, and diamond-shaped, beveled knives
(Prewitt 1981:74, 83). The technology and subsistence strategies of this phase represent a
completely different tradition from the Austin phase. Burned rock middens fell nearly out of use
(Black et al. 1997) since bison were once again available in Central Texas (Collins 1995:388;
Dillehay 1974). Hunting, especially of bison, may have attained equal or greater importance than
gathering, as reflected by the lithic tool assemblage that seems to have been oriented toward bison
procurement and processing (Prewitt 1981:74, 84). However, faunal data from sites such as
Panther Springs Creek (41BX228; Black and McGraw 1985) indicate that deer continued to be
the most important meat resource at some sites. Cultigens are occasionally recovered from Toyah
phase sites and âthe occasional presence of corn cobs suggest that either Toyah Phase peoples
actively traded with agricultural peoples; or they practiced a mixed hunting, gathering, and
nomadic horticultural subsistence patternâ (Prewitt 1981:74).
Toyah phase sites occur on terraces and in rockshelters. In addition to those previously
mentioned, the artifact assemblage includes Clifton points, drills, grinding stones, bison bone
tools, bone beads and awls, ulna flakers, freshwater mussel shell pendants, and a variety of
objects made of perishable materials (e.g., wood, cordage). The presence of Caddoan ceramics is
indicative of an extensive trade network. Features consist of large flat hearths, basin-shaped
hearths, pits, and burials. As with the Austin phase, both cemeteries and isolated interments
occur in the Toyah phase. Although cremations are present, semiflexed burials predominate.
Intergroup conflict is suggested by the frequent occurrence of arrow points embedded in the
human remains (Prewitt 1981:83-84).

18

Historic Period (post-A.D. 1519)
The most radical cultural changes in Central Texas occurred during the Historic period, which is
characterized by the appearance of and, much later, the domination by Europeans and by the
invasions of nonlocal Indian groups, such as the Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and the Comanche.
Although possibly initially contacted by Spaniards in the early 1500s, the culture of the local
Indian populations in Central Texas probably did not change very much until the later 1600s
when, Spanish Missions were founded in east Texas and pressure from Native American horse
nomads forced, local groups to seek protection in Spanish missions. Prior to this time, the
changes that occurred were probably adaptations of elements of European material culture by
local groups rather than a destruction or abandonment of their own cultures. After 1700, many
traditional stone, bone, and wooden items were replaced by European metal, glass, and cloth
articles and by guns. Eventually, the traditional cultures of the local populations collapsed.
European-introduced diseases had a devastating effect on local groups; while after the
introduction of the spread of the horse onto the Plains, nomadic raiding groups (i.e., first the
Apache, then the Comanche) from the north and west forced most local groups to abandon much
of the area. Most groups were simply destroyed by the combined effects of the nomadic raiders
and the foreign diseases introduced by the Europeans. Today, the only Native American group
who has claimed Central Texas ancestry is the Tonkawa, and descendents of some of the
âfamiliesâ that sought refuge in the Spanish Missions, but are not federally recognized as valid
groups (Black 1989:33). Nevertheless, it is clear from excavations in historic sites in San
Antonio that the process of integrating Indians into European society was accompanied by a great
deal of cultural survival, and even European borrowing of Indian material culture (Hinojosa and
Fox 1991:113).

European-American History

Introduction
Texas in general, and San Antonio and Bexar County in particular, have had both a rich and a
complex history that stretches almost as far back as the presence of Europeans in North America.
The following discussion is intended to be only a general overview of this history, and for more
detail the reader is referred to the sources listed in the bibliography. For the sake of convenience,
this section has been divided into several subsections, covering various time periods, including
the period of Spanish exploration and early missionizing efforts (1519-1718), the period of
permanent Spanish colonial settlement (1718-1821), the period of Mexican statehood (1821Â­
1836), the Texas Republican period (1836-1846), the early period of American statehood (1846Â­
1865), the post-Civil War period (1865-1900), and the twentieth century (post-1900). The
foundation and development of Lackland AFB is explored over three stages during the twentieth
century: Establishment of Lackland AFB â Kelly Field Annex (1913-1945), Lackland AFB
(1945-Present), and the Lackland Training Annex (1954-Present).

19

Early Spanish Exploration and Missionization (1519-1718)
The initial Spanish presence in Texas began with the arrival of Alonso Alvarez de PiÃ±eda on the
Texas coast in 1519 to explore the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Webb 1952a:380). Attempts to
explore and colonize continued sporadically, and in 1528, Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca landed
accidentally on an island known to the Spanish as Malhado, possibly Galveston Island (Webb
1952b:261â262; Winship 1990:1â4), when a boat he had been marooned on was driven ashore.
Several scholars have suggested that Cabeza de Vaca and his companions eventually traveled up
the Guadalupe or San Antonio River valley after leaving the coast and thus passed close to the
San Antonio area. Although their exact route is still in dispute, it is known that his small group
managed to cross the continental divide and in 1536 were met by Spanish slave catchers in
Sonora or Sinaloa, Mexico, and subsequently taken to Culiacan (Webb 1952b:262â263; Winship
1990:1â4). Exploration of the region continued apace. It was clear by 1550, however, that there
were no golden cities or wealthy countries to conquer north of Mexico. Consequently, Spanish
expansion into the American southwest and Texas slowed, leaving eastern Texas largely
unexplored.
The indigenous people in what is now southern Texas represented a heterogeneous series of
perhaps three to four dozen district bands of hunters and gatherers (Wade 1998). The were once
considered to be designated under the rubric of the âCoahuiltecan groups,â which refers to the
linguistic designations for these people living in the Mexican state of Coahuila before the creation
of Texas (Newcomb 1966). But recent studies have suggested that they spoke at least two and
perhaps four distinct languages including Sanan (Johnson and Campbell 1992). Recent
developments have called for the abandonment of the term âCoahuiltecansâ as an ethnic term,
since it does not refer to any known group (Hester 1998) or recognize the reality of broad cultural
diversity. Spanish Mission baptismal, marriage, and death records record the following groups
residing near present San Antonio in the early eighteenth century, which we collectively regard as
âindigenous groupsâ: Ervipiame, Jumano, Jumee, Macocoma, Mescal, Mesquite, Muruame,
Papanac, Pataguo, Pausane, Siaguan, Sijame, Terocodame, Teimamar and Yorica (Wade
1998:632).
Tension between the indigenous groups and the Spanish, and indigenous groups and the Apaches,
escalated during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in southern Texas. Ultimately
the Spanish protected the indigenous groups against the Apaches with the establishment of the
first two Spanish missions in 1671. Eventually, four missions serving an area running northsouth across the Rio Grande were established on the Coahuila frontier (John 1975:172â174). The
French, led by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, began intruding into Eastern Texas and
established Fort Saint Louis in 1685 (John 1975:182). The Spanish, fearing an increased French
presence in East Texas, reacted by establishing missions and presidios in East Texas to act as a
buffer against further French encroachment into the region (Pool 1975:28; Webb 1952b:483â
484). Fray Massanet and de Teran and came into the region of the Medina and San Antonio
rivers in 1691, both commenting on the fine plains and large numbers of buffalo they encountered
(McGraw and Hindes 1987:64). Fray Massanet had called the area San Antonio de Padua, in
honor of St. Anthony of Padua, and had suggested that it would make a suitable location for a
mission. De Leon reportedly left a small garrison of men there, and although some have taken
this to be the beginning of the Presidio of San Antonio (McGraw and Hindes 1987:64),
permanent settlement of the San Antonio area was still 27 years in the future.

20

Missionization in Texas reached its culmination in May 1718 when the locations for a new mission
on the western bank of the San Antonio River and a town three-quarters of a league away near
San Pedro Springs were designated (de la Teja 1991:29). The former was to be called Mission
San Antonio de Valero and the latter the Villa de Bexar. Due to a lack of men and material, the
construction of the town and mission did not occur until 1719, marking the beginning of
permanent Spanish settlement in Texas.

Spanish Colonial Settlement (1718-1821)
The three-pronged approach to settlement that the Spanish implemented involving presidio,
mission and civilian settlements, proved to be more successful that the establishment of mission
and presidio or presidio alone (Gilmore 1991). This was certainly true in the case of San
Antonio. A total of five missions was built on the San Antonio River, all within a 12-mile radius
of the present city. Mission San Antonio de Valero was established first in 1718, followed
shortly by Mission San Jose in 1720. Eleven years would pass before MissiÃ³n Nuestra SeÃ±ora de
la Purisima ConcepciÃ³n, MissiÃ³n San Juan Capistrano, and MissiÃ³n San Francisco de la Espada
were found from East Texas to San Antonio in 1731.
Population growth was slow in the area. Initially most inhabitants were members of military
households. AlarÃ§onâs first settlement had included âan engineer, stone mason, blacksmith, and a
number of women and childrenâ (de la Teja 1988:56). By 1721, San Antonio had become a
series of wood and mud huts (jacales), which was typical of the initial stages of a frontier
settlement. Land use outside the cities was chiefly confined to large-scale ranching activities.
Ranching activities during the eighteenth century were very relaxed, attributable in part to the
small population and lack of market. Round-ups amounted to little more than the gathering of
wild, unbranded stock when meat or hide and tallow was needed (McGraw and Hindes 1987:71).
Some ranches in Bexar County, however, were more productive (McGraw and Hindes 1987:72).
During the mid-1700s, the missions of San Antonio attracted a variety of Indian groups, primarily
hunter-gatherers who were chiefly Sanan and Karankawan. The missions also attracted Indians
of other origins, some of whom were fleeing Spanish disruptions in Nuevo Leon and other
regions of northern Mexico (Hester 1989:200). However, not all Indian groups were interested in
what the missions had to offer. Mission settlements were disrupted frequently from 1721 to 1749
by raiding Lipan Apaches. Even after a formal truce had been signed in 1749, thievery and
limited hostilities took place throughout the rest of the century (de la Teja 1988:61). Hostilities
were also experienced with various Comanche bands, which disapproved of the tentative link
between the Spanish and the Apache during the last half of the 1700s.
Outside political factors during the latter half of the eighteenth century had a great impact on the
region. The completion of the Seven Years War (1754-1762) and the signing of the Treaty of
Paris in 1763 resulted in the French and Spanish ceding most of the lands east of the Mississippi
to England, and Spain acquiring the Louisiana Territory from France. This, of course, put an end
to the years of Spanish paranoia and called for a reassessment of the situation in New Spain
(McGraw and Hindes 1987:74). Local effects included Bexar being selected as the new
provincial capital. Growth continued at a slow but steady rate, encouraged by the American
Revolution. As a result of the removal of the French threat, the strategic status of the Missions
declined and they were eventually secularized by 1793. With Spain and America eager to avoid a
costly war, the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 brought about the establishment of a âno-manâs landâ
21

between the Texas and Louisiana border. In 1810, Spanish rule began to deteriorate rapidly.
Discontent in the provinces resulted in ten years of bitter strife, which culminated in Mexican
Independence in 1821.
In the Bexar County region, filibusters made forays into the province encouraged as they were by
the claim that Texas was actually part of American Territory. The local governing body changed
hands frequently as a result of battles waged between Spanish loyalists and revolutionaries. In
one particularly bloody incident, 1,000 persons in the province who were accused of being
revolutionaries were rounded up and executed or exiled (Fehrenbach 1968:130).

Mexican Statehood (1821-1836)
Following Mexican Statehood, conditions around Bexar slowly improved. In fact, prior to
Mexican Independence, Moses Austin had applied for and received permission to bring 300
families of American colonists to Texas in 1821 (Fehrenbach 1968:135). Although he died
before ever seeing his grant, he convinced his son, Stephen F. Austin, to carry out his plans
(Fehrenbach 1968:136; Reese et al. 1994:26). Because of liberal land policies, Austin had many
volunteers eager to accompany him. Colonists had to be of good moral character, were required
to become Spanish (then Mexican) citizens, and were also required to convert to Catholicism (not
rigorously enforced). Under Spanish/Mexican law, land was distributed as follows: one labor
(71.6 ha [177 ac]) to each family engaged in farming, one league (1,792.0 ha [4,428 ac]) to each
family engaged in ranching and one-third league (597.3 ha [1,476 ac]) to each single rancher
(Fehrenbach 1968:140). The government charged a flat title fee and Austin received a fee. The
law required the land to be developed within two years or forfeited. In all, 297 titles were issued
of which only seven were forfeited. Most of the settlers claimed to be ranchers for obvious
reasons.
Beginning in 1823, immigration laws were changed to allow empresarios to offer lands to heads
of families willing to settle in Texas. In San Antonio, the Republic Constitution of 1824 affected
local politics. Former Spanish provinces were turned into sovereign states. Texas and Coahuila
were combined into one state with Saltillo named as the capital. The legislature of Coahuila
passed its own colonization laws in 1825, which continued to open the area to EuropeanAmerican settlement. After a decade of empresarios, there were over 20,000 EuropeanAmericans and their slaves in Texas. The empresarios managed to bring colonialization further
in one decade than the Spanish government had in three centuries.
One of the effects of increased immigration was the opening and improvement of roadways,
many of which followed the old Spanish caminos. The influx of settlers into the region brought
changes in local politics as European-American immigrants gained influence and Mexicans were
politically overshadowed. Alarmed by this situation, the Mexican government passed the Decree
of April 6, 1830, which prohibited the further âcolonization of Mexican territory by citizens of
adjacent countries - meaning the United Statesâ (Fehrenbach 1968:165). It also prohibited the
importation of slaves, further alienating European-American settlers (Reese et al. 1994:27).
From 1832 to 1835, a series of conflicts and temporary solutions continued to drive a wedge
between Colonial Texas and Mexico. When meetings were held in San Felipe, the EuropeanAmerican immigrants adopted resolutions and framed a state convention resulting in separation
from Coahuila and the formation of a new state. In 1835, a Mexican army crossed the Rio
22

Grande bound for San Antonio to squelch the rebellious Texans. A call to arms was issued and
hostilities began in earnest (Fehrenbach 1968:193; Reese et al. 1994:27). Many of these
conflicts, later known as the Texas Revolution, were fought in and around the City of San
Antonio and culminated in the battle at the Alamo (formerly Mission San Antonio de Valero) in
the Spring of 1836. During the siege of the Alamo, elected representatives from the colonies
were meeting at Washington-on-the-Brazos, where the Texas Declaration of Independence was
signed on March 2, 1836. After Santa Annaâs victory at the Alamo, the Texans defeated his
forces at the Battle of San Jacinto and the Republic of Texas was born (Reese et al. 1994:27).

The Republic of Texas (1836-1846)
In 1836, the Republic of Texas was a âbackwater.â The government of the new Republic was
loosely organized and there were no schools (Fehrenbach 1968:247). Most of the 40,000
residents were subsistence farmers. When the first elections were held in the new Republic, an
overwhelming majority voted to approve a union with the United States. The issue of slavery,
however, stood in the way of annexation for 10 years. The old Spanish/Mexican conventions,
though, were quickly replaced with the more familiar American customs (Reese et al. 1994:27).
The population of Bexar County, formed in 1836, continued to be predominantly Mexican. The
new Republic, however, was eager to encourage immigration. It did so by offering its most
abundant commodity, land. Land disbursal policies were governed by the Constitution of the
Republic of Texas. Texans belonged to one of three classes of citizens, based on their time of
arrival in the Republic, and were accorded rights to land dependent on their status. Heads of
households were distinguished from single men. For example, First Class citizens were those
who arrived before March 2, 1836. A First Class head of household was entitled to one league
(179.2 ha [4,428 ac]) and one labor (71.6 ha [177 ac]), whereas a First Class single man was
entitled to one-third league. It was incumbent on each settler to locate the land, often unavailable
in the county in which he currently resided; to provide witnesses who would attest to his (or her)
arrival date; and to pay for the survey and the filing fees. In most counties, the Board of Land
Commissioners worked without delay because of the extreme importance of land to the citizens.
Land was also distributed in differing amounts for military service (Fehrenbach 1968:283).
Later, the land laws under the State of Texas were set up in much the same way, with land also
being granted preemptively, through âsquattersâ rightsâ (Reese et al. 1994:27-28).
The land grant system, especially as it existed during the Texas Republic period, had a significant
effect on land in the Lackland AFB area. Several landowners had holdings on the land that now
comprises Lackland AFB, but two individuals had a particular impact on the City of San Antonio
and Lackland area during the mid-1800s (Reese et al. 1994:27-28). Samuel Augustus Maverick,
son of a prominent South Carolina family, arrived in San Antonio de Bexar on September 8, 1836
(Chabot 1934:3). In 1836, he married Mary Ann Adams during a trip to Alabama; she would
later become a chronicler of local history. Maverick, intent on concentrating his holdings in
Texas, sold valuable properties from New York and Alabama and invested the proceeds in Texas
land (Chabot 1934:3). He was deeply involved in local politics. In addition to being a Bexar
representative at Washington-on-the-Brazos, he was mayor, treasurer, and alderman of San
Antonio, and held many state offices. At the time of his death in 1870, he was purportedly one of
the largest landowners in the United States (Chabot 1934:6). Maverick owned a great deal of
land in and around the Lackland AFB area (Reese et al. 1994:28).

23

The second individual to have a great impact in the region, and specifically on the Lackland AFB
area, was Nathaniel Lewis, born near Nantucket, Massachusetts in 1806. An adventurer, he
eventually found himself in Texas âwithout a penny in his pocketâ (Chabot 1937: 327-328). He
arrived in San Antonio around February of 1836 and decided to settle there. He had soon started
a thriving business on the Main Plaza, selling goods from the East Coast (Chabot 1937:328;
Reese et al. 1994:28). In addition to his dry goods store, Nat Lewis was also deeply involved in
the cattle and horse business. He had large land holdings on which he ran his stock, much of it in
and around the Lackland area. At one time, Lewis owned all of the Rafael Herrera, E. F.
Morales, Francisco Rivas, and N. Flores surveys. It is possible that he used some of it for ranch
land, although it is certain he never lived there. His house in San Antonio can still be seen at 112
Lexington. Nat Lewis, Sr., died in San Antonio in 1872. Sometime before 1890, the property in
the Lackland area passed from the Lewis family. That tract would eventually be known as the
McKay Ranch (Reese et al. 1994:28).
Bexar County was created in 1837 and San Antonio was named as the county seat (Webb
1952b:540). Anglo-European and European-American settlements expanded north into the
Central Texas plateau and west into the formerly Mexican rangelands of South Texas (Fox
1989:89). A steady stream of German immigrants began settling in the Texas hill country north
of San Antonio after about 1840. With this northward and westward expansion, large-scale cattle
ranching came to dominate the economy of Central and South Texas, and by the 1850s, Texas
was exporting cattle on a grand scale (Fox 1989:89). Statehood was finally granted on December
29, 1845, after Mexico again tried to reclaim Texas as a part of its territories in 1837. During this
dispute, San Antonio and Bexar County had once again become the setting for numerous
hostilities between Mexican and Texan forces.

Early U.S. Statehood: 1846-1865
Development and industrialization flourished after the annexation of Texas by the United States
(Fox 1989:89). Commerce, which had faltered during the hostilities with Mexico, now improved.
San Antonio became a center for stagecoach travel into the region (McGraw and Hindes 1987:95).
Emigration from the United States increased rapidly, as did the arrival of refugees from abroad. In
1850, San Antonio contained about 3,500 inhabitants. By 1856, the population swelled to 10,000
(Webb 1952b:540), and was diversified as Europeans, many of German ancestry, moved into the
area and became the dominant influence (Fehrenbach 1968:285; Reese et al. 1994:30). The
ongoing âAmericanizationâ of all aspects of Texan life was demonstrated by a growing use of
âAngloâ styles of architecture and building materials. While absentee landowners owned some of
the areas around San Antonio, this was not the case throughout most of the region where small
subsistence farming predominated (Reese et al. 1994:30).
Settlement continued to expand westward, generally at the expense of Native American groups.
Towns grew up at important road intersections and river crossings. In Central Texas, most goods
were laboriously moved overland from coastal ports by two-wheeled Mexican carts and freight
wagons (Fox 1989:89). In response to these transport difficulties, local, small-scale industries
began to develop; mills and other water-powered operations were constructed on falls along major
rivers. The need for building stone also encouraged quarries and lime-burning operations in the Hill
Country. Other small manufacturing industries took root in San Antonio and the city developed
into âa frontier entrepot for the entire central Texas regionâ (Fox 1989:90; Reese et al. 1994:30).

24

In the Lackland area itself, specifically the western half of the J. M. Becerra Survey, the deed
records contain a reference to a 1851 transaction made from Enoch Jones and J. W. Smith to
Christopher C. Gove. Mr. Gove received this property in three different transactions in 1852 and
1856. The documentation of the sale of 546.3 ha [1,350 ac] of this property in 1856 suggested the
presence of a structure or structures, and specific mention is made in the deed to the following:
. . . two negro slaves, one a woman about forty years old and the other a boy about ten years old also
forty eight head of cattle fifteen hogs, one ? one yoke of oxen one ox wagon one buggy & harness,
together with my stock of fowls of every sort all my household and kitchen furniture my carpenters &
farming tools and utensils of every sort the corn beans and other products & all materials now in &
pertaining to my said farm . . .â [BCDR nd:41].

The land, which is the eastern section of the western half of the Becerra Survey, can be more
accurately described as a strip of land that extends from the northern boundary to the southern
boundary of the Becerra Survey (which coincides with the Medina River). Only about the
northern third of this property, therefore, would be currently located on Lackland AFB. This
section of land was sold to Martin and Lucinda Kosta. Although the date they sold the property
was not discovered, it is known that by 1913 the property was in the possession of D. H. Dolan.
There was a structure located on the 1903 USGS sheet that is probably included in this section of
land. A check of the 1850 to 1860 tax records fails to reveal either Mr. Gove or Mr. Kosta paying
property taxes on anything in the Becerra Survey. Mr. Gove is referenced in the census records
for 1850, citing that he was a 35 year-old-male from âN.Z.â (Reese et al. 1994:35, 39).
During the 1850s, the political situation in Texas and throughout the United States, was uneasy.
Texas voted overwhelmingly in February 1861, to follow the rest of the South in seceding from
the Union. In general, the region around San Antonio fared better that most during the Civil War.
San Antonio was named as the headquarters for the Cavalry of the West in 1864 and saw some
benefit from this posting. Some smaller communities actually benefited from the increased travel
through the region (McGraw and Hindes 1987:99; Reese et al. 1994:39). The route that was
known as âthe military roadâ led northwest from San Antonio. Apparently, it ran almost due west
from San Antonio to Leon Creek, at which point it turned northwest and ran relatively straight to
Bandera Pass. Near the boundary between Bandera and Kerr counties, it passed out of Bexar
County at the headwaters of San Geronimo Creek, possibly somewhere near the present-day town
of San Geronimo (Pressler 1858). This road may have passed as close as 2-3 miles south of the
Lackland area and may be the source of the names âGovernment Canyonâ and âGovernment
Houseâ (Pressler 1858; Reese et al. 1994:39).

Postwar Civil War Period: 1865-1900
The years immediately following the Civil War were ones of economic setbacks and subsequent
adjustments all over Texas. During the period of âReconstructionâ which followed, Federal
soldiers occupied the state and Radical Republicans ran the government. Much of the San
Antonio area had suffered from a severe drought in 1863, the effects of which lasted beyond the
end of the war (McGraw and Hindes 1987:100). Cotton and land prices went down, and where
slaves had once worked large plantations, tenant farming became the norm. In 1869, many
residents left the city when a severe cholera epidemic further devastated San Antonio (McGraw
and Hindes 1987:100).

25

Despite these upheavals, Texas in general, and San Antonio in particular, began the slow return to
economic stability, aided by existing economic conditions (McGraw and Hindes 1987:100; Reese
et al. 1994:39). The first of these was the large numbers of cattle running freely in the area,
which formed the basis for the developing South Texas cattle industry. San Antonio played an
important role throughout the 1870s as a staging center for the great cattle drives to the northern
railheads. The second condition was a large freed-black population that chose to stay in the area
rather than emigrate. The continued presence of blacks resulted in the continuation of large farms
and ranches now based on wage labor or tenancy, rather than slavery. Finally, a local wool
industry began to develop in San Antonio (Reese et al. 1994:39).
The arrival of the railroad in San Antonio in 1877 was the most important event during the
postwar period, as it was in most of Texas (Fox 1989:90). The railroad made San Antonio a
shipping point for cattle and farm products and brought with it improved transportation for both
people and merchandise (Webb 1952b:540). Ease of travel also contributed to continued
immigration and an increase in population. During the latter part of the nineteenth century, the
extensive amount of land suitable for range led to a cattle industry boom in Central Texas, while
the increased population caused a period of land speculation (Reese et al. 1994:40). Economic
depression, brought on by drought in the late 1880s, changed the face of Texas agriculture
permanently. Many ranches were lost to foreclosure or subdivided into small farm holdings that
were sold to farmers.

Twentieth Century: post-1900
By 1900, San Antonio was the crossroads for five railroads and had a population of 53,321
(Webb 1952b:540); the population of Bexar County as a whole stood at 69,000 individuals
(Taylor et al. 1991:118). At that time, major industries included flour mills, foundries, and
breweries; educational institutions included 29 private schools and colleges (Webb 1952b:540).
Subsequent to 1900, overall expansion in the economy of Bexar County was rapid. Although the
county contributed only about one percent of the total oil production for the state as a whole, San
Antonio developed as a headquarters for producers and operators working in other parts of the
state. At the same time, the extensive deposits of stone, clay, sand, and gravel in the county
continued to promote the development of the building supplies industry. Agriculture and stock
raising continued to be important as approximately 70 percent of Bexar County was in farmland,
and more than half of this acreage was rangeland (Reese et al. 1994:41; Taylor et al. 1991:119).
The establishment of San Antonio as a military center added a new dimension to the regionâs
economy during the twentieth century. The San Antonio Arsenal dated to 1859, prior to the Civil
War. World War I spurred the addition of facilities at Brooks AFB, Camp Travis, Camp Stanley,
Camp Bullis and Camp Kelly. Randolph AFB followed in 1928, in the years between the wars
(Reese et al. 1994: 41; Webb 1952b:540).

Establishment of Lackland AFB â Kelly Field Annex: 1913-1945
Brigadier General George P. Scriven, U.S. Army Chief Signal Officer testified before the U.S.
House of Representatives in August 1913, concerning the establishment of a military aeronautical
center in San Antonio, Texas. The center of military aviation envisioned by Scriven had its
beginning on May 7, 1917, with the establishment of Camp Kelly. The future base was to be
26

located on a tract along Leon Creek, chosen for the relatively level land and access to the
International and Great Northern Railroad shops and roundhouse, as well as to the tracks of the
Southern Pacific Railroad (Isbell 1962:67). Abundant water was available from artesian wells.
U.S. involvement in World War I magnified the importance of military aviation and accelerated
the urgency of developing Camp Kelly, which was one of only four operational Army flying
fields in the country. An Engineering Department, a Recruit Camp and Concentration Center,
primary flight training camps, an aircraft mechanics training program, a school to train ground
officers, an aviation supply depot, and primary and advanced flying schools were among the
activities located here during the war (Freeman 1997:L-31). As American mobilization continued
into the summer of 1917, it became clear that the land originally acquired for Camp Kelly was
insufficient to accommodate the new facilities and the growing number of recruits. San Antonio
Chamber of Commerce obtained leases for additional land that was then sublet to the
government. The property, which became known as Kelly Field No. 2, was adjacent to Camp
Kelly and extended west and south to Leon Creek. The School of Advanced Flying,
unquestionably the most important program to use the facilities at Kelly Field No. 2 during World
War I, was authorized by General Order No. 70, which was issued October 3, 1917. Recruits
continued to pour into the facility, creating a need for additional buildings at Kelly Field No. 1 in
September 1917 to accommodate them and the various programs under development.
Kelly Fields No. 1 and No. 2 reached their largest population during World War I in December
1917, when more than 1,100 officers and 31,000 enlisted men were stationed there. When the
Armistice brought an end to the fighting in Europe on November 11, 1918, more than 30 new Air
Service flying fields were in operation. Following the Armistice, though, strong American
isolationist views reasserted themselves and Congress cut military appropriations dramatically.
With this loss in funding, the Air Service experienced cutbacks in personnel and equipment.
From 1921 to 1925, appropriations by Congress for the purpose of Army construction were cut by
42 percent. Despite these cutbacks, Kelly Fields No. 1 and No. 2 continued to play an important
role in national defense. In 1925, Kelly Fields No. 1 and No. 2 were officially separated and
designated as Duncan Field and Kelly Field, respectively, but changes to the installation were
mostly in name only.
In March 1943, the depot was renamed San Antonio Air Service Command (SAASC). This name
was used until 1944 when the depot was renamed San Antonio Air Technical Service Command,
a name used until 1946. Kelly AFB probably reached its peak of production in late 1944, when
air combat declined or ceased in the North African, European, and Mediterranean theaters and
aircraft were shipped back to the United States for repair and storage (San Antonio Air Logistics
Center, Office of History 1980:92, 102). The installation expanded in size once again in 1945
when it annexed nearby Normoyle Ordnance Depot, which served as a depot for Fort Sam
Houston during World War I. With the 1943 expansion and the acquisition of Normoyle in 1945,
the San Antonio Air Technical Service Command became the largest air depot in the United
States.

Lackland AFB: 1945-Present
By July 1945, many of the facilities at SAASC were utilized by the Army Air Force (AAF)
Personnel Distribution Command to receive returning veterans and reassign them. With massive
demobilization of the Army Air Forces, SAASC was redesignated as the Army Air Forces
27

Military Training Center, on 1 February 1946. The purpose of the redesignation was to
consolidate all enlisted basic training. All new recruits would report to the training center for
Basic Training School (BTS), thus coining the phrase âGateway to the Air Force.â To reinforce
the consolidation, the Officer Candidate School (OCS) was transferred to the military training
center from Maxwell Field (Benson and Jones 1975:5, 8â9). The Army Air Forces Military
Training Center was redesignated as the Indoctrination Division, Air Training Command
(IDTRC) on 1 November 1946. Lackland AFB was officially established on 1 July 1947 when
the land that the IDTRC occupied was officially renamed Lackland Air Base. That land began as
a desolate bombing range, called âthe Hill.â Aside from surveys and records of land transactions,
little is known about land use in the Lackland area. In general, settlement in the area appears to
have been sparse even into the late nineteenth century. A 1903 USGS topographic map reveals
only four structures within the confines of the base. Choice of this site for the base may have been
related to the fact that the land was so sparsely settled. Training continued to be the primary
mission and during World War II, over 100,000 personnel were trained as officers at the Hill (37
Training Wing History Office [TRW/HO] 1994:ix-xi).
Overcrowding was a prevalent problem at the newly established Lackland AFB. To provide a
more permanent solution, Air Training Command (ATC) solicited bids in 1951 for barracks for
12,000 men ($26 million), additional training facilities ($1 million), and classrooms ($750,000).
Later that year, the United States Air Force (USAF) asked Congress for another $63.7 million for
additional new construction at Lackland. Construction began in 1951 on 129 âI-dormitoriesâ in
the 7000 and 10000 building areas at Lackland. Besides housing, Lackland AFB constructed
other support facilities for the basic training mission. To handle the huge number of recruits
flowing into the base on a daily basis, a wooden framed, recruit-processing center, costing
$572,093 and known as âthe Green Monster,â because it was painted green, was completed in
November 1952 (37 TRW/HO 1994:19).
During the mid-1950s and early 1960s, the variety of Lackland training programs increased. The
3700th Air Force Indoctrination Wing was redesignated the 3700th Military Training Wing
(MTW) due to the addition of nonresident training. Officer training was also stressed at Lackland
with the addition of the Pre-Flight Language Training Course and the Chaplain Training Program.
In 1955, Basic Military Training was restructured to consist of two phases. Phase I (six weeks) of
basic training was conducted at Lackland and Phase II (five weeks) was conducted at a technical
school (Benson and Jones 1975:21â22). With the addition of the 3275th Technical Training
Group in 1956, the Lackland training mission expanded to include technical training programs.
Cryptographic and Personnel Training were also transferred from Scott AFB, Illinois, in 1957. A
new phase of training was developed in 1957 with the establishment of the USAF Marksmanship
Center. In 1957, the Sentry Dog Program, which would later play an important role in âProject
Top Dog 45â during the Vietnam War, was also established (Benson and Jones 1975:24â25, 33).
In 1957, Lackland AFB received its first, large, permanent structure. Wilford Hall, the ninestory, 500-bed hospital, was constructed on the northern end of the base and replaced 94
temporary buildings that had been used by the base for hospital functions. In 1959, the 3700th
Military Training Wing was redesignated the Lackland Military Training Center (LMTC).
Because of the expansion of the Air Force in the 1950s, the service was in further need of
officers; thus, an Officer Training School (OTS), a three-month-long intensive course to develop
leadership and skills for recruits with four-year college degrees, was opened at Lackland AFB.
Within several years, OTS had become the major source of officers for the Air Force (Winkler
1997:52).

28

In the mid 1960s, with the war in Viet Nam escalating, Lacklandâs existing built environment was
insufficient for handling the increased number of trainees. Between 1951 and 1966, more than
400 buildings were constructed at Lackland and at least 200 older buildings, including barracks
and dining halls, were demolished. In spite of these improvements and the new facilities,
Lackland did not have enough space for the increased number of recruits to support the Southeast
Asian buildup. Thus, in 1969, ATC approved a $21 million expansion at Lackland that included
the construction of five Recruit Housing and Training (RH&T) dormitories at a cost of $15
million (Dalton 1966:12â14; Trest and Hines 1978:20). During the late 1960s and early 1970s,
many changes were evident at Lackland. Major construction included five Recruit Housing and
Training dormitories, two theaters, a dispensary, a library, two visiting officersâ quarters, a
shopping center, a sentry dog veterinary clinic, and a Security Police operations building.

RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

The cultural resources investigation documented in this report was undertaken with three primary
management goals in mind:
1. to locate all historic and prehistoric archaeological resources occurring within the
designated APE;
2. to evaluate the significance of these resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP or for designation as an SAL; and
3. to make recommendations for the treatment of these resources concerning the proposed
undertaking, based on their NRHP and SAL evaluations.
Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resources properties are a function of the
potential importance of such properties in addressing defined research needs. The assessment of
significance of a cultural resource property is based on federal and state guidelines and
regulations, which are reviewed below.

NRHP ELIGIBILITY
Cultural resources investigations generally are undertaken with the purpose of identifying
resources that are listed on or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Any cultural resource that is
listed on or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is known as a âhistoric property,â and
the term âeligible for inclusion in the National Registerâ includes both properties formally
determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet National
Register listing criteria (36 CFR 800.2). The criteria to evaluate properties for inclusion in the
NRHP are codified under the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended. These criteria are presented in 36 CFR 60.4 (aâd), which provides the guidelines used
to determine a siteâs eligibility for inclusion in the National Register. Subsequent to the
identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, these four criteria of
eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and culture
is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location,
design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
31

(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR 60].

SAL ELIGIBILITY
At the state level, archaeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. The archaeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
2. The archaeological site is situated on private land that has been specifically designated as an SAL . . .
and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archaeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the siteâs original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, GMI personnel performed a search of the available data sources. Records
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and TARL at the University of Texas at
Austin were queried to identify known sites within and proximate to the APE (within 1 km). A
literature review to obtain information from previous investigations and data from geologic maps,
soil surveys, and aerial photographs was undertaken. Historic mapsâincluding nineteenth- and
twentieth-century county maps held in the Library of Congress and early twentieth-century soil
maps produced by the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry and Soilsâwere also consulted.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
The archaeological survey methodologies employed by GMI in the current study are in
accordance with the State of Texas Antiquities Code and the guidelines of the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) as approved by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) office of Division
of Archeology and overseen by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO). The Department
of the Interior guidelines for addressing cultural resources were also followed.

32

A pedestrian walkover was initially employed within each of the proposed alternative routes.
Ground surfaces were inspected and exposed areas along stream cutbanks were observed for the
presence of cultural materials and buried living surfaces. Each of the proposed roadways would
encompass a width of approximately 50 feet with lengths of approximately 1.34 mi for
Alternatives 1 and 2 and 2.05 mi for the Proposed Action. Therefore, according to CTA/THC
standards, a combined total of 54 total shovel tests were required to adequately sample the total
area encompassed by the proposed routes (16 shovel tests per mile). During the survey, however,
it was determined that this number was unnecessary due to extensive disturbances encountered
within each proposed route (discussed in the Results section below). In short, extensive
quarrying within the Leon Creek floodplain and numerous construction activities conducted along
U.S. Highway 90 and Growdon Road have significantly impacted the integrity of the deposits
within the majority of the area encompassed by the proposed routes. As a result, shovel tests
were judgmentally excavated in areas that appeared to contain intact deposits. The total number
of shovel tests excavated during this process was 39. While this number is significantly less than
the 55 shovel tests initially estimated prior to fieldwork, the number is sufficient given the level
of disturbances encountered in the field. Shovel tests were approximately 30-x-30-cm square and
were to be excavated to sterile subsoil or to 80 cm below surface (bs); however, many of the
shovel tests were terminated upon contact with impenetrable subsurfaces (e.g., concrete, asphalt,
dense gravels). Soils for each shovel test were screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-inch) hardware
cloth for any cultural material.
Originally, backhoe trenching was planned within the Leon Creek floodplain and potentially
along terraces containing Holocene alluvium; however, trenching was also determined to be
unwarranted for the above stated reasons. Specifically, quarrying within the Leon Creek
floodplain has significantly impacted deeply buried Holocene sediments. Pleistocene gravels
which typically underlay Holocene alluvium in this region were commonly observed on or just
below the ground surface throughout the floodplain where the routes for Alternatives 1 and 2 are
positioned. This indicates that quarrying penetrated through the Holocene age sediments in this
location. A 1963 aerial image shows that this disturbance was widespread and occurred
throughout the floodplain (Figure 4). Thus, the potential for deeply buried intact archaeological
deposits within the floodplain portions of the APE is considered to be very low.
All materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at the Center for
Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio. In addition, field notes
detailing the survey conditions, landscape features, level of disturbance, and initial interpretations
of the cultural resources were maintained by the project archaeologist. Documentation for each
shovel test included stratigraphy, soil characteristics, and the presence or absence of cultural
materials. Digital photographs were taken throughout the survey to record the general
topography, environmental conditions, current land use, and other factors.

SITE CRITERIA
A site is defined on the basis of content and extent. When a shovel test yields cultural material,
additional shovel tests are excavated in a cruciform pattern at 5-m (16.5-ft) intervals around the
initial test until two sterile shovel tests are encountered in each cardinal direction. In the absence
of visible archaeological features such as structural foundations, a site is defined within the extent
of positive shovel tests. For surficial materials or shovel test contents, a site is defined as five or

33

more cultural items of at least two different artifact materials or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone
tool manufacturing debris exhibiting different raw materials, or manufacturing debris in
combination with stone tools; or several different historic-era ceramic [or glass] types, or
ceramics in addition to glass) within a 20-m (65.6-foot) square. Cultural remains meeting these
criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archaeological Site Data Form, and
submitted to TARL. Conversely, the discovery of one or two cultural items (either surface or
subsurface) not meeting these criteria is considered an isolated occurrence of human activity and
is simply documented by location and content as a âlocalityâ; likewise, historic-era material
representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not considered a site, with only location and
content documented.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

ALTERNATIVES 1 AND 2
Alternatives 1 and 2 extend from U.S. Highway 90 and continue south through the Leon Creek
floodplain and end south of an agricultural field located to the south of Morey Road (see Figure
2). The northernmost end of the routes cut through an open lot before descending into the Leon
Creek valley. According to personnel from the City of San Antonio, the open lot, which both
alternative routes extend through, was once used as a landfill (see Figure 2). The exact
boundaries of the landfill could not be specified, but according to Shovel Tests 16-18, excavated
south of U.S. Highway 90, it is clear that portions of the lot that the routes pass through are highly
disturbed. For example, each shovel test encountered disturbed deposits consisting of concrete,
limestone fragments, and gravels (Table 1). In addition, the remainder of an asphalt lot was
clearly visible on the surface within the open field (Figure 5). It is very unlikely that the
installation of Alternative 1 and 2, including the Alternative 1 Guard Shack (see Figure 2), would
encounter any intact archaeological materials within the open lot.
South of the open lot, very dense vegetation comprises the wooded area along the Leon Creek
meander. The terrain encountered within this area was very uneven and did not appear natural.
Sequences of small hills with very dense vegetation resembled push piles and indicated that the
area was likely impacted to some degree by quarrying activities. Shovel Tests 19 and 20,
excavated in this area between the open lot and Leon Creek encountered dense gravels and could
not be excavated below 20-30 cmbs. Only a small portion of floodplain, approximately 20-m
wide directly adjacent to the current channel, appeared to contain intact sediments. Shovel Test
21 was excavated in this area and consisted of a brown (10YR 4/3) loam between 0 and 40 cmbs
underlain by a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam between 40 and 80 cmbs; however, no
cultural materials were recovered. A quarried area approximately 30 m from Shovel Test 21
revealed a deep soil profile exposure (Figure 6). The profile exhibited a thin A horizon that was
underlain by a thick homogenous B horizon extending to approximately 4 meters below the
surface until contact with Pleistocene gravels. No buried soils or cultural materials were
observed in the exposed profile.

The northernmost meander of Leon Creek was then crossed and the route between the two
meanders was traversed. Again, sequential rows of spoil piles were encountered throughout this
area and were found south of the southernmost stream meander as well (Figure 7). In addition,
numerous large quarry pits were observed (Figure 8), which over time have filled in with
sediment as water from the surrounding higher ground drains directly into the pits. It is clear that
quarrying has compromised the integrity of the deposits adjacent to Leon Creek within this
particular region. Several shovel tests were attempted within these areas (Shovel Tests 22, 34Â­
35), but each was terminated due to contact with dense gravels. These gravels are similar in
composition to the Pleistocene gravels observed at the base of the quarry exposure described
above, suggesting that Holocene alluvium was significantly disturbed or removed all together
during the quarrying process. This evidence minimized the amount of shovel tests excavated near
Leon Creek and also precluded the need for deep backhoe trenching.

PROPOSED ACTION
The archaeological survey was continued along the Proposed Action ROW at the Proposed
Action Guard Shack location (see Figure 2). This area consists primarily of sparsely populated
mesquite trees with minimal understory vegetation and prairie grasses within the open areas. It is
situated on a nearly level stream terrace that formed in loamy alluvium. Ground surface visibility
was approximately 10-20 percent. Six shovel tests (1-6) were excavated evenly throughout the
proposed guard shack location as no high probability landforms which would require
concentrated efforts were identified during the walkover. In most cases, a very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) to dark grayish brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam extended from the surface to
80 cmbs and contained stream polished limestone gravels ranging from 10-40 percent in
volumetric density. Shovel Test 1 was actually terminated at 45 cmbs as the gravel layer became
impenetrable (Figure 9). While the soils encountered within the Proposed Action Guard Shack
location seem to retain fair integrity, several push piles of disturbed sediment and asphalt were
observed within this area (Figure 10) indicating that some level of disturbance has occurred.
According to soil maps (see Figure 3) and the 1963 aerial map (see Figure 4), quarrying has
occurred in the areas surrounding this guard shack location and may explain the disturbances
observed. No cultural materials were encountered in this area.

Shovel testing was resumed to the north where the Proposed Action parallels and partially
overlaps the existing Growdon Road. It was immediately apparent that construction activities
have impacted the deposits within this area. Asphalt and gravels were encountered in Shovel
Tests 7 and 8 preventing excavation beyond 15 cmbs. Following this, the remnants of an asphalt
road were observed immediately to the west of the existing Growdon Road (see Figure 2). Where
the road has collapsed, a clear soil profile was observed and photographed (Figure 11). Directly
below the road, a brown (10YR 4/3) loam with abundant calcium carbonate threads was
observed. This horizon is consistent with the Bk horizon subsoil mapped in the Sunev clay loam
soil series and its position directly below the road indicates that the upper A horizon was
significantly disturbed or removed altogether during construction of the road. No cultural
materials or buried soils were observed in the exposed profile, and due to the apparent
disturbances, the potential for intact archaeological deposits within this area is considered to be
low. Progressing to the south as the proposed route begins to turn gradually to the southwest,
shovel tests (10-13) began to encounter more intact soils. The same Bk horizon subsoil that was
observed below the road in the above description was encountered at approximately 40 cmbs
below a brown (10YR 4/3) loam A horizon. Shovel tests were terminated upon contact with the
sterile subsoil and no cultural materials were encountered.
Progressing to the south of Shovel Test 13, the area began to again show signs of modern
construction activities. An asphalt parking lot and several push piles were encountered just south
of Shovel Test 13 (Figure 12) and modern trash piles were also observed adjacent to the parking
lot. The asphalt lot appears to be relatively recent and no additional work was required in this
area. To the south of this, the route then overlaps with the northwest corner of a fenced property

containing horses and construction equipment (see Figure 2). The area surrounding this property
within the ROW appears to have been used for dumping and the presence of additional push piles
suggested that the subsurface may have been disturbed as well. To determine if this was the case,
Shovel Tests 14 and 15 were excavated and each was terminated early due to contact with
asphalt, concrete, and limestone gravels (Figure 13). In sum, the potential for intact cultural
archaeological materials within the area east of Leon Creek and west of Growdon Road is very
low.

13. Shovel Test 15 profile with scale

Figure 13. Shovel Test 15 profile with scale.

Southwest of the Proposed Action Guard Shack location described above, the Proposed Action
passes through an impoundment lot (Figure 14) and then through an active quarrying staging area
(Figure 15). The location of the Alternative 2 Guard Shack location overlaps almost entirely with
the quarrying staging area (see Figure 2). These areas have clearly been significantly impacted
by construction activities, and aside from photodocumentation, no archaeological work was
necessary there. The southernmost segment of the project area is immediately south of the
quarrying staging area and Morey Road where Alternatives 1 and 2 converge with the Proposed
Action. The area consists of a recently plowed agricultural field with very good ground surface
exposure (Figure 16). The property owner did not allow subsurface testing on this property. As a
result, the field was walked over at 10-m intervals to inspect the ground surface for
archaeological materials; however, none were encountered. Numerous chert cobbles were noted
during the walkover, but all were determined to represent natural cobbles.

The remaining portion of the Proposed Action extends from Highway US 90 and continues east
to Growdon Road. As the route turns east from the open lot, it enters into a secondary hardwood
forest. Surface visibility was less than 10 percent, but it was obvious that the area was highly
disturbed. Extensive areas were scattered with large concrete chunks (Figure 17) and sequential
rows of push piles containing fragments of asphalt (Figure 18). Shovel Tests 23-26 confirmed
that these impacts are widespread and extend into the subsurface as each of these shovel tests
encountered concrete fragments and gravels and were terminated at 20 cmbs or shallower.
Progressing to the east, remnants of a historic structure, designated site 41BX1886, was
encountered immediately south of the Peerless Equipment Company (Figures 19 and 20). The
razed structure is divided into two sections by a concrete pathway and a dual-step porch (Figure
21). East of the walkway, the area appears to have been used as an outbuilding, while an
enclosed wooden fence west of the walkway indicates that the western portion was likely used as
a small stable area.
The earliest topographic map to show structures in this vicinity is the 1953 West San Antonio
topographic quad which depicts a road system connecting this structure along with several other
structures within and south of the Proposed Action ROW (Figure 22; see Figure 4). According to
the 1963 aerial image this road system appears to have extended south into the interior of the
Leon Creek meander and may have been used to access a construction staging area which is also
visible on the 1963 image (see Figure 4). The area immediately south of the collapsed structure
was inspected for the presence of the additional mapped structures; however, none was
encountered in primary context. Instead, structure remnants were found piled along a steep ridge

to the south above the Leon Creek floodplain (Figures 23 and 24). The materials mixed within
the rubble consist primarily of large concrete slabs and corrugated metal, although numerous
domestic items such as glass bottles, aluminum cans, tin wash pales, tin cans, and other
household items were also observed. The majority of the aluminum cans found across the site
exhibited a pull-tab opening, and according to approximate initial production dates of pull tabs,
one can of Schlitz beer can be dated to as early as 1963 (Figure 25).
According to the time series presented in Figure 22, the area where the structures are mapped
appears to have been impacted by construction activities sometime between 1963 and 1966,
although the type of construction and degree to which it impacted the structures is unclear from
the aerial photographs. A metal pesticide container observed on the ground surface adjacent to
the collapsed structure was produced by Transvaal, Inc. of Jacksonville, Arkansas sometime
between 1971 and 1976 suggesting that the structures were not destroyed between 1963 and 1966
and may have been used into the 1970s. However, it is also possible that the structures were
demolished at some point between 1963 and 1966 and the pesticide container was deposited on
the ground surface at a later date. Together, the artifacts observed, in addition to the historic
topographic and aerial maps reviewed, suggest that the area represents a demolished, midtwentieth century homestead site that may have been used into the 1970s. No other timediagnostic items or historic imagery was found that would suggest that the site was occupied prior
to the mid-twentieth century.

Six shovel tests were excavated adjacent to the mapped structures to search for subsurface
deposits (see Table 1). Only three of the six shovel tests (Shovel Tests 27, 36, and 37) yielded
cultural materials consisting of window glass and bottle glass fragments, several of which were
burned. The soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of a dark grayish brown (10YR
4/2) or brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam. The shovel tests were terminated between 5 and 20
cmbs due to contact with extremely dense gravels. The shallow soils and encounter with dense
gravels indicates the integrity of the deposits within the site boundary have been negatively
impacted by construction activities.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The intensive archaeological survey conducted for the proposed relocation of Growdon Gate at
Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas resulted in the excavation of 39 shovel tests
and the documentation of 41BX1886, a mid-twentieth-century homestead site, within and
adjacent to the Proposed Action ROW. Site 41BX1886 has been adversely affected by
demolition and ground-disturbing activities associated with modern development adjacent to
Lackland AFB. The majority of the artifact assemblage associated with this site is out of primary
context and consists of items typical of mid-twentieth-century refuse. Given the minimal
information potential associated with this site and lack of integrity, it is unlikely that it will
provide any additional information relevant to understanding community and regional
development in Bexar County during the mid-twentieth century. Thus, site 41BX1886 is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL.
The vast majority of the project area was found to be in a disturbed context resulting from
numerous modern construction activities associated with Lackland AFB and the City of San
Antonio. As a result, the contextual integrity of deposits within the project area has been
significantly compromised.
Aside from 41BX1886, no archaeological materials were
encountered in the project area. Therefore, based on the results of this cultural resources survey,
there is low potential for deposits containing archaeological materials within the current or
proposed ROW. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, no further
investigation is necessary. Consequently, it is recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed. If archaeological deposits are encountered during construction, work should cease and
the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
