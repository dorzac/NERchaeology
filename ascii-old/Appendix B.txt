DATA COMPILATION FOR ARCHEOLOGICAL PLANNING AT
HEMISFAIR PARK, SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS

This document is part of the deliverable for Task 2 (Data Compilation for Archeological
Planning at HemisFair Park, San Antonio, Texas) of Work Order No. WO 34-2014-02-26 issued
by the City of San Antonio to Adams Environmental, Inc., and Prewitt and Associates, Inc. The
task was done at the request of the Texas Historical Commission and is an effort to help gauge
how previous construction over the entirety of HemisFair Park might have impacted archeological
resources, and hence identify where archeological investigations would and would not be
warranted as development of HemisFair Park proceeds. Specific information requested included
the following: previous known construction impacts, including those relating to development of
HemisFair in 1968; previous archeological investigations; and results of geotechnical
investigations and soils studies. It was anticipated that the information would be presented
chiefly on maps. As the project unfolded, discussion with the City of San Antonio and Texas
Historical Commission resulted in the addition of several other kinds of information, all relating
to initial development (construction of the Play Escape) proposed for the southwest corner of
HemisFair. The added information consists of a conceptual plan for the Play Escape development
and two historic maps for the area. The objective is to allow specific discussion about the kinds
and locations of archeological investigations that would be appropriate in connection with the
Play Escape.
The project area for this study is the full current extent of HemisFair Park (bounded by S.
Alamo Street on the west, Market Street on the north, S. Bowie Street on the east, and E. Cesar
Chavez Boulevard on the south, for a total of 96 acres), plus 8 acres south of E. Cesar Chavez
Boulevard that the HemisFair Park Master Plan specifies for development as well.
The maps showing the information described above are presented as layers in two
GeoPDFs, one for the full project area (HemisFair_Archeological_Data_Compilation.pdf) and one
focusing on the southwest corner where the Play Escape development will be
(HemisFair_Archeological_Data_Compilation_PlayEscape.pdf). These layers are described below.
2011 Aerial: Aerial photograph taken in 2011 shows near-modern conditions. It is not fully up-todate, though, as expansion of the east side of the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center,
construction of associated parking areas, and realignment of Market and S. Bowie Streets have
resulted in extensive modification to all of the project area east of the convention center and
Tower of the Americas and north of the Institute of Texan Cultures.
Archeological Sites: Shows the 29 sites within the limits of the project area recorded on the
Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas as of May 2014 (may exclude sites
recently recorded during monitoring for the convention center expansion and road realignment
not yet reflected on the Atlas). Most are nineteenth- or twentieth-century house locations or
associated features, 1 of which (41BX588) was moved from its original location. Two (41BX574
and 41BX575) are the locations of commercial buildings. One (41BX584) is a public hall and
theater (Beethoven Hall/Magik Hall) built in 1913 after the previous hall burned. One (41BX8) is
a section of the eighteenth-century Acequia Madre, and another (41BX1298) has sections of
acequia along with other historic features that are now wholly or partly under the convention
center. Nineteen of these are designated as State Antiquities Landmarks (includes 4 buildings
that are not in their original locations); 2 also are Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, as is
41BX8, which is not a State Antiquities Landmark. At least 6 sites (41BX572, 41BX573,
41BX574, 41BX1296, 41BX1297, and 41BX1298) are under the convention center and probably
have been destroyed. The attached table provides details on these 29 sites.

Previous Archeological Work: Shows the 11 archeological investigations performed in the
project area prior to 2014, as indicated on the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites
Atlas (may exclude some very recent work associated with 2014 convention center expansion and
road realignment not yet reflected on the Atlas). The information is shown so that individual
investigations can be seen (Details) and with that information masked (Summary). The attached
table provides details on these 11 investigations.
1968 HemisFair: Shows three kinds of buildings and structures associated with HemisFair ’68.
One indicates the locations of buildings erected for the 1968 exposition that have been removed.
Photographs (attached) indicate that most of these temporary buildings had concrete slab
foundations at or near grade, and thus it is expected that disturbance associated with their
construction and demolition often may have been relatively shallow, ca. 1–2 ft. The other two
kinds of buildings and structures shown are water features and elevated ramps, many of which
have been demolished. Photographs (attached) indicate that construction and subsequent
removal/demolition of these features likely disturbed these areas to greater depths, ca. 3–5 ft at
least. Not depicted here are the locations of still-extant HemisFair buildings, which because of
their generally large size and more-permanent construction, likely resulted in much deeper
disturbance (e.g., Tower of the Americas, convention center and theater, Texas Pavilion [now the
Institute of Texan Cultures], U.S. Pavilion [now the John H. Wood Federal Courthouse and
Adrian Spears Judicial Training Center], and Mexico Pavilion [now the Mexican Cultural
Institute]); these are included on the layer titled Extensively Modified Areas. Aside from areas
modified for the erection of buildings and structures for HemisFair, it is safe to say that virtually
all of the project area was disturbed to some extent during preparations for the fair. Attached are
a series of photographs taken during construction depicting various levels of associated
disturbance.
Boreholes (Overburden Thickness): Shows the locations of 24 recent geotechnical boreholes
and the thickness of introduced fill they exposed. Two in far eastern part of the area near
Interstate Highway 37 and a large earthen ramp (now removed) that connected HemisFair Park
with Alamodome east of the interstate, had extreme amounts of fill (10 and 13 ft). Three others,
also in the eastern part of the area, had no fill. Fill in the other 19 ranged from 1.0 to 7.5 ft,
averaging 2.7 ft. The widespread presence of substantial amounts of fill is consistent with the fact
that the project area has had a very active history of landscape modification associated with
demolition of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century residential areas before HemisFair
’68, construction of HemisFair ’68, subsequent demolition of much of HemisFair ’68, and
construction and expansion of the convention center. It was thought originally that it might be
useful to combine this information with soils data; this proved not to be the case, however, as a
single soil, Houston Black clay, is mapped throughout the project area.
Extensively Modified Areas: Shows areas judged to be extensively and deeply modified, based
on reconnaissance survey. Most are the footprints of larger non-historic buildings (i.e., HemisFair
’68 and later), where it can be assumed that site preparation extended to sufficient depths to
remove or completely disturb any archeological remains present. Also includes some heavily
landscaped areas adjacent to the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, Tower of the Americas,
and Institute of Texan Cultures where deep disturbance is likely.
Archeological Recommendations: Combines information from other layers (Extensively
Modified Areas and 1968 HemisFair Water and Ramps) and the extent of recent modification
associated with expansion of the convention center, construction of associated parking areas, and
realignment of Market and S. Bowie Streets to distinguish three settings within the project area:
(1) areas where disturbance clearly is so deep and pervasive that no further archeological work is

2

warranted; (2) areas that are disturbed but perhaps not so severely, such that archeological
investigations may be warranted during future development (mapped generously at a macro scale
and not ground truthed in detail; parts of these areas undoubtedly will be found to be badly
disturbed as work proceeds); and (3) areas at the east edge where construction, and associated
archeological monitoring, are currently under way.
Play Escape Conceptual Plan: Shows an overview of development planned for the Play Escape
area in the southwest corner of the project area. Central to the proposed development will be a
paved, roofed walkway (promenade) that will run southwest-northeast between the E. Cesar
Chavez Boulevard gateway into the park and Hemisfair Plaza Way (future E. Nueva Street).
Paved plazas will be at both ends of the promenade, and at its center will be a paved play square.
These features will divide the project area into quadrants of unequal size. Much of the southeast
quadrant will be devoted to water and sand play areas and adjacent lawns and planted areas; a
small pump house will be associated with the water play area. Most of the narrow northeast
quadrant will be planted areas or lawn, with an area of playground equipment at its southwest
corner. The northwest quadrant will contain a new restroom facility (on the site of an extant
facility to be demolished) and a remodeled restroom, an area for playground equipment, play
sculpture, a games porch with concrete play tables (chess, foosball, and table tennis), and planted
areas. The southwest quadrant will be mostly a multipurpose play lawn adjacent to the S. Alamo
Street plaza gateway into the park with some planted areas.
1896 Sanborn: Shows the 1896 Sanborn Fire Insurance Company map for the southwest corner
of the project area. Shows the location of the Acequia Madre and buildings facing onto S. Alamo
Street, Goliad Street (now Hemisfair Plaza Way, future E. Nueva Street), and Water Street, as
well as various outbuildings.
1912 Sanborn: Shows the 1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance Company map for the southwest corner
of the project area. Shows the location of the Acequia Madre and buildings facing onto S. Alamo
Street, Goliad Street (now Hemisfair Plaza Way, future E. Nueva Street), and Water Street, as
well as various outbuildings.

Two test units and three backhoe trenches excavated in
southwest quadrant of Hemisfair; the acequia and a lateral
were intersected in two trenches, and an anomaly was
identified in the third. Stone apparently robbed from west
ditch wall. Also recovered late-19th- and early-20th-century
artifacts from original sediment layers, some thought to be
derived from infill of acequia.

Results
Exposed and removed fill from a 95-ft-long segment of the
acequia in preparation for HemisFair. Documented acequia
construction and fill. Removed early-20th-century debris and
turn-of-the-century artifacts. Found a handful of Spanish
colonial ceramic sherds mixed in with later materials.

Monitored utilities installations at Acosta-Halff and
Kampmann-Halff houses along Goliad Street and at Koehler
and Espinosa houses along old Water Street. Identified the
limestone foundation of the Huebaum House.

Monitored utility trench excavation on east side of Hemisfair.
Identified 3 rock-lined cisterns or privies. Construction
suggests they date to mid-19th century, but each contained
late-19th- to early-20th-century trash.

Photograph 041-001. View to the south of HemisFair ’68 under construction. Circular building is HemisFair Arena
(now demolished with the area incorporated into the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center), and the building being
erected in front of it is the HemisFair Theater (now the Lila B. Cockrell Theater). Large building at lower right is the
original portion of the convention center. Recently completed E. Cesar Chavez Boulevard extends left-right through
upper part of photograph along the south edge of HemisFair ’68. One-story, boxy, flat-roof temporary buildings are
under construction among historic-age buildings in southwest corner of HemisFair ’68 (right center), and excavations
for extension of the San Antonio River are along Market Street at the bottom edge of the photograph and on the left
side of the convention center. Major buildings not yet begun include the Tower of the Americas (left-central edge) and
the U.S. Pavilion (upper central, adjacent to E. Cesar Chavez Boulevard.

Photograph 003-01. View to the northwest across HemisFair ’68 under construction. Partially completed Tower of
the Americas, HemisFair Arena and Theater behind it, and convention center are notable. Goliad Street extends updown on the left side of the photograph, with partially completed circular U.S. Pavilion (now the John H. Wood Federal
Courthouse) to far left. Ramps and water features are between Goliad Street and HemisFair Arena and below and to
the right of the Tower of the Americas.

Photograph 041-040. View to the southwest of the southwest corner of HemisFair ’68. Intersection of S. Alamo Street
and E. Cesar Chavez Boulevard (under construction) is at upper left, and Goliad Street runs left-right through the
center. The rear of Beethoven Hall/Magik Theater and adjacent Acosta-Halff and Kampmann-Halff houses are at upper
right. Numerous temporary buildings and HemisFair Arena are under construction.

Photograph 041-025. View to the southeast of the southeast part of Hemisfair ’68 under construction. Just-completed
E. Cesar Chavez Boulevard is on the right, and the Texas Pavilion (under construction, now the Institute of Texan
Cultures) is at upper left. Goliad Street with adjoining historic buildings is on the left. The present federal building
and adjacent parking lot eventually would be constructed in the foreground. Note scattered debris/tree piles from land
clearing.

Photograph 041-009. Aerial view (facing southwest) from the Tower of the Americas toward the circular U.S. Pavilion
(now the John H. Wood Federal Courthouse) under construction next to recently completed E. Cesar Chavez Boulevard.
Goliad Street extends left-right at center. Temporary HemisFair ’68 buildings and historic-age buildings (red roofs) are
on the north side of Goliad Street, with HemisFair water features and ramps nearby.

Photograph 060-014. View to the north of the Tower of the Americas under construction with domed HemisFair Arena
to its left. View is probably from just north of Goliad Street near the current federal building. Disturbances associated
with construction of water features, ramps, and aerial monorail are notable.

Photograph 043-013. View of disturbance associated with HemisFair ’68 construction. Location and view direction
are unknown, but the building on the upper right is the now-demolished HemisFair Arena, suggesting that this is a
generally northerly view from the southwest part of HemisFair ’68. The trench may have been excavated to hold subsurface utilities or a water feature. The metal-frame supports for a temporary building are visible behind the excavating equipment.
