The Trinque Site (41ER27),
Erath County, Texas
William A. Cloud and James E. Smith II
with a contribution by Patricia M. Landau and Gail A. Colby

ABSTRACT
Mapping and subsurface testing of the Trinque Site (41ER27), a partially
collapsed rockshelter and associated lithic scatter in southeastern Erath County,
North Central Texas, was conducted in the spring of 1991 by the Office of the
State Archeologist, Texas Historical Commission, in conjunction with the Texas
Archeological Stewardship Network. A child interment, initially exposed by an
artifact collector, was salvaged and limited testing yielded three features and
1118 artifacts. From stratigraphic relationships, it appears the burial dates to
either the Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric period at the site, although a burial
pit outline was not discernible. One of the stone features found adjacent to the
burial may be a hearth that was used during mortuary practices. Cultural material dating from the Late Archaic to the end of the Late Prehistoric period was
recovered, although artifacts diagnostic of the Middle Archaic have reportedly
also been collected from the site as well.

INTRODUCTION

The Trinque Site investigation was initiated after Lance Trinque, a
Stephenville native and local artifact collector, contacted the Office of the State
Archeologist (OSA), Texas Historical Commission (THC) in December 1990, to
report his f’md of a human burial. Trinque had been excavating a rockshelter in
southeastern Erath County when he came upon the inhumation, which he immediately re-covered with soil. During a field trip to the site by Trinque, the senior
author, and Dan Prikryl, then of the Department of Antiquities Protection, THC,
it was determined that the burial would be scientifically excavated and the
adjacent intact deposits at the shelter would be tested to obtain associated stratigraphic control. Mr. Jimmy Smith, a local resident and member of the Texas
Archeological Stewardship Network, was asked at that time to assist in the
excavation and report of findings from Trinque’s excavations and our spring
1991 site evaluation.

PREVIOUS WORK

Lance Trinque began excavations at the Trinque Site several years before
contacting the THC about the site. When he began his excavations, shallow pot
holes were already present in the eastern portion of the shelter. He dug in several
areas of the rockshelter, finding apparent intact deposits throughout. Although
Mr. Trinque’s excavations were not controlled in the usual archeological sense,

Cloud and Smith ~ The Trinque Site

he used extreme care and separated artifacts by approximate levels. Thus, his
collection from the site provided a glimpse of the projectile points present in the
rockshelter, and his collection method suggested these artifacts were from intact
deposits.
THE SITE ENVIRONS

The Trinque Site is located in North Central Texas in the Great Plains
province (Fenneman 1938:106). Within this province, the site is situated Within
the physiographic region known as the Lampasas Cut Plain. It is in southeastern
Erath County (Figure 1), within an area characterized by a topographically high,
rugged landscape with relief similar to the Hill Country of Central Texas. In
Erath County, the average yearly rainfall is 29.17 inches, with three-fourths of
this amount falling between April and October, and the average annual temperature is 64.3 degrees Fahrenheit (Wagner et al. 1973).
Cretaceous sediments from the Trinity Group and Fredericksburg Group are
exposed in southeastern Erath County (Sheldon 1979:113). These marine sediments were deposited during both progressions and regressions of a warm shallow sea. Approximately 80 million years ago, after a major regression of the sea,
erosion began stripping away much of these soft sediments. This portion of Erath
County, known locally as the Chalk Mountain area, remains topographically
high because the upper part of the Fredericksburg Group is composed of very
hard limestone that has protected the lower shales and marls from erosion
(Sheldon 1979:115). The Edwards Formation occurs within the upper part of the
Fredericksburg Group. It is composed of fossiliferous limestone and Edwards
chert, a fine-grained siliceous stone favored for tools by aboriginal groups
throughout much of Texas. In North Central Texas, the Edwards Formation thins
out from the thicker Edwards deposits found in Central Texas (Sellards et al.
1932:339). In Central Texas, the Edwards Formation contains fairly large nodules and relatively thick lenticular lenses of chert. In contrast, the North Central
Texas Edwards chert occurs as small embedded pebbles or thin lenticular lenses
and is somewhat coarser-grained than the Central Texas variety (Larry Banks,
1992 personal communication).
The Trinque Site rockshelter is located within an exposure of Edwards
limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). At this site, the local Edwards
chert was the predominant lithic resource utilized for tool production, especially
during the Late Prehistoric period. No outcrops of this chert were discovered in
the immediate vicinity of the site, however.
The Trinque Site is at an elevation of 416 meters (1365 feet) above mean
sea level (amsl) and is located at the northernmost head of an unnamed canyon
within the central Brazos River valley. This canyon contributes a headwater
drainage that forms a left bank tributary of Lallah Branch. Lallah Branch drains
northward into Pony Creek, which in turn drains into the Paiuxy River, a major
tributary of the Brazos River.

272

The canyon drainage is intermittent and flows to the northeast. A fairly
reliable seep spring is located at the southernmost head of this canyon, approximately 125 meters south-southeast of the Trinque Site. Elevation in this heavily
wooded canyon ranges from 378 meters (1240 feet) to 418 meters (1370 feet)
amsl. A wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines are present including assorted
oaks, Mexican Buckeye, juniper, elm, hackberry, and greenbriar. The modern
fauna includes white-tail deer, coyote, bobcat, cottontail rabbit, gray and red fox,
ground squirrel, rock squirrel, skunk, pack rat, raccoon, opossum, turkey, quail,
dove, and a wide array of other mammals, reptiles, and birds (Lance Trinque,
1991 personal communication).
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General Discussion
The archeology of the central Brazos River valley has been extensively
explored by both professional and avocational archeologists since the 1930s.
Professional work has concentrated on survey and salvage excavation connected
with reservoir construction in the area, while serious avocationals associated
with the Central Texas Archeological Society (CTAS) have contributed a great
body of archeological data for this region. The work of these two groups has
served to complement each other in the scope of their investigations.
The earliest archeological endeavors in this area were accomplished by the
CTAS. Frank Bryan, one of the founding members of that group, published the
first overview of the region based on observations made while conducting geological field work (Bryan 1930). Two subsequent publications (Bryan 1936,
1937) concentrated on reporting site survey data from Hill, Navarro, Limestone,
and McLennan counties. The first reported excavation in the region occurred in
1936 at the Waco sewage treatment plant in McLennan County, where members
of the CTAS uncovered what appeared to be a mass burial. Several authors
reported on these excavations in the bulletin of the CTAS (Meroney 1936;
Turner 1937; Lux 1937; Watt and Meroney 1937a).
Another founding member of the CTAS, Frank H. Watt, proved to be the
driving force behind a large number of archeological endeavors in the region. His
publications included articles on historic glass trade beads from the Stansbury
Site in Hill County (Watt 1937; Watt and Meroney 1937b), distinctive notched
stones in the area, which he named "Waco Sinkers" (Watt 1938), pottery sherds
from the Chupek Site in McLennan County that revealed a cultural connection
with the Caddo of East Texas (Watt 1941); he also reported on several excavations undertaken in the area (Watt 1965, 1967, 1978). In all, Frank H. Watt
published well over a hundred articles on the archeology of the region and Texas
(Redder 1985a), and was responsible for numerous other endeavors by the CTAS
that effectively opened the door to understanding the prehistory of the central
Brazos valley.

Professional archeological work in the region began in the late 1940s at the
proposed Lake Whitney reservoir along the Brazos River in Hill and Bosque
counties (Stephenson 1947, 1970; Jelks 1953, 1962). As other area reservoirs
were proposed in the next 30 to 40 years, professional archeologists were able to
investigate additional large tracts of land adjacent to some of the major waterways in the region. Investigations occurred at the Waco Reservoir (later renamed
Waco Lake) in McLennan County (Story and Shafer 1965; Prikryl and Jackson
1985), De Cordova Bend Reservoir (later renamed Lake Granbury) in Hood
County (Skinner 1971), Squaw Creek Reservoir in Somervell and Hood Counties
(Skinner and Humphreys 1973; Gallagher and Bearden 1976), Hog Creek Reservoir in southern Bosque and northeastern Coryell counties (Larson et al. 1975;
Larson and Kirby 1976; Shafer 1977; Hays and Kirby 1977; Henry et al. 1980),
Aquilla Lake in Hill County (Skinner and Henderson 1972; Lynott and Peter
1977; Skinner et al. 1978; Watson 1982; Brown et al. 1987), and the Lake
Whitney area was further investigated when the Corps of Engineers decided to
raise the pool level of the lake three meters (Skinner and Harris 1971; Skinner
and Gallagher 1974; Lynott 1978).
The great body of data from the avocational and professional work indicates
a long aboriginal presence from Paleoindian times through the Historic period in
this area of the central Brazos River valley. Much of the significant excavation
data has come from various rockshelters in the region, especially from the
shelters excavated at Lake Whitney. Rockshelters generally contain soils that
have better stratigraphic integrity than unsheltered areas, and thus, have a better
chance of containing intact cultural deposits. Deposits from this type of setting
usually allow individual components to be distinguished, which are otherwise
unseparable in open sites.
Rockshelter Excavations
Rockshelter excavations have provided much archeological data on the
prehistoric inhabitants of the central Brazos valley. Some of the shelters in this
area have been found to contain well-stratified deposits that have furnished a
wealth of information about aboriginal lifeways during the Late Prehistoric
period, and excavations at rockshelters in the Lake Whitney area in particular
have led to a much better understanding of cultural continuity and change in the
region during this period.
The first rockshelters investigated at Lake Whitney were Pictograph Shelter, Sheep Shelter, and Buzzard Shelter. These shelters, initially identified and
tested during the 1947 investigations at the reservoir, were excavated in 1950
(Stephenson 1970). Two important shelters discovered after the initial inventory
at Lake Whitney were the Blum Rockshelter and the Kyle Site. The former was
excavated in 1952 (Jelks 1953) and the latter in 1959-1960 (Jelks 1962). All five
of these sites were found to contain well-stratified deposits dating from the Late
Prehistoric period. 3elks (1962) used data from the Blum Rockshelter and the

274

Texas Archeological Society

Kyle Site, as well as the Smith Rockshelter in Travis County (Suhm 1957), to
conclude that the Austin phase (formerly termed focus) generally preceded the
Toyah phase in Central Texas. Due to the well-stratified nature of the deposits at
these shelters, he was also able to further define the trait character of those
phases.
Although Stephenson’s work occurred before Jelks’ excavations, it was not
reported until 1970. However, Stephenson’s (1970) findings from his work at
Lake Whitney corroborated Jelks’ conclusions about this time period. The following review of data from the five shelters in the Lake Whitney area is intended
to provide contextual information on the Late Prehistoric period in North Central
Texas relevant to the excavations conducted at the Trinque Site.
Pictograph Shelter, named for six red pictographs within it, had two separate strata. The lowest, Stratum II, contained a variety of features and artifacts
as well as abundant snail and mussel shell; the uppermost cultural deposit (Stratum III) contained fewer features, fewer snail and mussel shell, but a variety of
distinctive artifacts (Table 1). Using these material culture data, Stephenson
(1970:156) generally assigned Stratum II and III to the Austin and Toyah phases,
respectively. All occupation of the shelter was thought to have been seasonally
intermittent.
Sheep Shelter contained two distinct strata (Stratums II and III) that appeared to represent three separate occupations. The earliest occupation of the
shelter (in Stratum II) occurred during the Archaic period. Stratum III contained
both lower and upper occupation zones. The lower zone contained the most
intensive occupation at the site. The upper occupation zone in Stratum III contained no stone features, but had a number of distinctive artifacts (Table 2).
Although clear separation of the components was not observed, Stephenson
(1970:213-214) felt the cultural expressions in the upper and lower portions of
Stratum III were representative of the Toyah and Austin phases, respectively.
Buzzard Shelter was found to contain three separate stratigraphic levels,
although all three were dominated by materials suggestive of the Toyah phase
(Stephenson 1970:185). These strata contained distinctly different features, but
the types of artifacts were quite similar (Table 3). The cultural materials and
strata documented from the site suggested brief use during the Austin phase,
followed by a long series of short-term occupations during the Toyah phase
(Stephenson 1970:185).
The Blum Rockshelter, located in Hill County, was found to contain stratified deposits representative of the Late Prehistoric period (Jelks 1953). Three
strata with cultural material were identified: Stratums 1, 2, and 3. The strata were
easily separated throughout most of the site, except in one area where the
division between Stratums 1 and 2 was obscured; artifacts from this obscured
area were labelled from Stratum 1-2. Features at the site consisted of one hearth,
numerous ash lenses, piles of f’tre-cracked limestone, masses of charcoal, and
snail and mussel shell concentrations. The only hearth feature was found at the
base of Stratum 3, with very few artifacts in association. The lowest occupational

zone, Stratum 1, contained few artifacts, Stratum 1-2 yielded the widest range of
materials, while Stratum 2 had the largest number of artifacts Cable 4). The data
from this shelter indicated that Scallorn arrowpoints were generally found below
Perdiz arrowpoints at the site, and were thus of greater antiquity. In addition, all
of the sherds from the site were in the Perdiz-Cliffton zone (see Jelks 1953).
Major refinements in definitions for the Austin and Toyah phases came as a
result of Jelks’ (1962) work at the Kyle Site. At this shelter, Jelks found six
major, well-distinguishable strata, of which five contained cultural material dating predominantly to the Late Prehistoric period. Stratums 1 and 2, the deepest
and earliest occupation zones at the site, had Austin phase materials, while
Stratums 4 and 5, the uppermost occupation zones at the site, had a preponderance of Toyah phase materials. Stratum 3 contained a mixture of Austin and
Toyah phase artifacts. Feature and select artifactual data from the Kyle site is
provided in Table 5.
Using data largely from the Kyle Site, but supplemented by data from the
Smith Rockshelter (Suhm 1957), the Blum Rockshelter (Jelks 1953), and observation of unreported data, a list of shared and unshared traits was offered in an
effort to formally define the Austin and Toyah phases (Jelks 1962:84-99). In
Jelks’ list, unshared traits of the Austin phase consist of Scallorn and Granbury
arrowpoints, Godley dart points, Friday type knives, and serrated flakes (Jelks
1962:85-86). Unshared traits of the Toyah phase include Perdiz and Cliffton
arrowpoints, Covington type knives, small drills, snub-nosed end-scrapers, bison bone scrapers, rectangular, spatulate bone objects, locally-made Leon Plain
pottery, and trade pottery from cultures in adjacent regions (Jelks 1962:86-88).
Shared by the two phases were Cleburne type knives, side-scrapers, spall scrapers, crude bifacial implements, gravers, spatulate deer ulna implements, bone
awls, hammerstones, manos, grinding slabs, hematite pigment, smoothed antler
tines, and perforated mussel shells (Jelks 1962:89). Stephenson’s (1970:185-186)
work at the three shelters he excavated at Lake Whitney also suggested that
Austin phase people were more prone to building stone-lined hearths and were
fonder of snails and mussels as dietary supplements than Toyah phase people.
The above rockshelter data from the Late Prehistoric period in North Central Texas indicates that both Austin and Toyah phase people were apparently
entrenched in the area. The Trinque Site investigation reported herein revealed a
cultural zone with undetermined relationships to the Austin phase.
DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
As noted earlier, the Trinque Site consists of a rockshelter situated high in a
northeast-trending canyon, with an associated hilltop lithic scatter. The site is
approximately 50 meters (east-west) by 40 meters (north-south). The shelter is
about 50 meters long and 4.5 meters deep, and ranges from one to two meters in
height. The shelter faces south and is located just below the Edwards limestone

rimrock. The mouth of the shelter is obscured by thick vegetation. The shelter is
divided by a major roof fall; the east and west ends appear as separate shelters.
These two rockshelter areas were designated as Room A on the west and Room B
on the east (Figure 2). The roof fall, containing numerous large limestone blocks,
may well be protecting a large section of intact cultural deposits at the site. The
area above the shelter slopes upward gradually and is moderately vegetated,
primarily with juniper. An occasionally travelled pasture road, running roughly
parallel to the rooms, is located a few meters south of the shelter.

Room A

The west room measures 17 meters east to west, is from one to 3.5 meters
deep (north-south), and from 1.5 to two meters in height. Roof-fall limestone
boulders are located in front of the eastern half and east of this room. The slope
below the entrance is moderate, and covered with both trees and shrubs (Figure
3). The hilltop area of the site is easily accessible at a low point in the rimrock at
the western edge of the room.
The intact portion of the floor in Room A is relatively level. Three disturbances in the room were noted and assigned designations upon the initial visit to
the site; all of these excavations were backfilled at the conclusion of the project.
Disturbance #1 was located near the western edge of the shelter. It was 81 cm
(east-west) by 65 cm (north-south) and 28 cm deep. Disturbance #2, located in
the center of the room, had an amorphous shape and was by far the deepest and
most extensive disturbance at the site. It measured 2.27 meters (east-west) by
1.34 meters (north-south), and had a maximum depth of 1.37 meters (eastern
portion of disturbance). The child burial removed during this project came from
the western portion of this excavation, which also produced the majority of
artifacts in the Trinque collection, including Middle Archaic projectile points and
a possible Early Archaic dart point from the deeper deposits. Disturbance #3,
located near the eastern edge of the room, was 91 cm (east-west) by 1.26 meters
(north-south) and 26 cm deep.
Room B

This room is approximately 27 meters east to west, one to 4.5 meters deep,
and one to 1.5 meters in height. Roof-fall limestone boulders are located at the
western edge of the room. The slope below the entrance is steeper and more
heavily vegetated than that observed at Room A, but the intact floor of the room
is relatively flat. The dripline plunges northward at one point while the back wall
plunges southward at another point, creating the effect of three separate areas
(see Figure 3). Disturbance #4, located in the central and largest area of the room,
has an extremely amorphous shape. It is roughly four meters (east-west) by 2.7
meters (north-south) and 10 to 33 cm deep; most of this large disturbance is from
10 to 20 cm deep.
INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES

The first visit to the site by the senior author occurred on December 14,
1990. After photodocumenting the Trinque Collection, a general reconnaissance
(including compass and pace mapping) was made of the rooms, talus slope, and
hilltop portion of the site. At that time, four chert tools were surface mapped and
collected: an arrowpoint preform (Figure 4f), one arrowpoint distal fragment, a
Scallorn arrowpoint (Figure 4i), and a Pedernales dart point (Figure 50. The Late

Prehistoric artifacts in this group were located at the southern edge of Disturbance #4, while the Pedernales dart point was located within the lithic scatter on
the hilltop.
Plans were made over the winter to return to the site in order to remove the

288

Texas Archeological Society

child burial, determine the stratigraphic integrity of Room A, and instrument
map the site. TASN Steward Jimmy Smith and his Action Team (Laurie Moseley,
Lorna Smith, Sallie Taylor, Jerry Grubis, Deana Grubis, and Lynda Cockburn)
volunteered for this field work along with the senior author, Daniel Prikryl, as
well as Lance Trinque.
The site investigation was conducted on March 7-10 and April 6 and 7,
1991. A north-south (magnetic) base line was established to bisect Room A just
inside the west end of Disturbance #2 (Figure 6). This base line is perpendicular
to the long axis of Room A. An east-west grid line running perpendicular to the
base line was then placed to run down the pasture road south of Rooms A and B.
A permanent horizontal datum point, marked with a quarter-inch piece of rebar,
was established along the north-south base line. The top of this rebar also serves
as vertical datum for the site.
Re-excavation of the child burial (Feature 1), located near the western edge
of Disturbance #2, was undertaken with Mr. Trinque’s guidance. This area was
in Room A, approximately 1.5 meters from the edge of the dripline and two
meters from the back wall of the room.
Test Unit 1, a one meter x one meter square, was one meter west of the
north-south base line in Room A. This unit was strategically placed to explore a
level area near the child burial to locate cultural feaatres and develop a stratigraphic association for the burial. It was hoped that this unit would be sufficient
to define the site’s stratigraphy; however, the deposits bottomed out before
Middle or Early Archaic artifacts (several documented from Disturbance #2)
were encountered.
Test Unit 2 was a one meter (east-west) x 15 cm (north-south) unit. This
unit was placed just south of the child burial to find a portion of the burial pit
outline or uncover any other feature associated with this interment. The unit’s
size was primarily dictated by its location amidst the previously excavated and
backfilled portion of Disturbance #2.
Test Unit 3, another one meter x one meter square, fell under the dripline of
Room A, with approximately half of the unit within the room. Test Unit 3 was
excavated to uncover any Middle Archaic or possible earlier deposits in the
shelter, and thus obtain a more complete strafigraphic record of the room.
All test units were excavated for the most part in 10 cm arbitrary levels as
natural or cultural levels were not discernible; a few thicker levels were used in
sterile or disturbed zones. The matrix from each level was screened through oneeighth-inch hardware cloth. Trowels were used as the primary excavation tool
and were supplemented with ice picks in the lower hard-packed levels.
STRATIGRAPHY

As a rule, stratigraphic breaks were not easily distinguished in the three
excavated units. However, more distinct soil horizons were present in the lower
deposits in the shelter. A total of eight soil strata were recognized in Test Unit 1,

which had the best stratigraphic integrity of the units (Figure 7). The strata will
be described in sequence from top to bottom.
Stratum L Overlain by several cm of leaf litter; four to eight cm thick;
unconsolidated, very fine, light gray shelter fill (decomposed limestone powder
and small angular roof spalls); sterile of cultural material. This stratum appeared
to cover the entire shelter; its lower boundary was strongly undulating.
Stratum H. Dark brown humus composed primarily of roots and rootlets;
four to 10 cm thick; sterile of cultural material. The lower boundary of this

290

Texas Archeological Society

stratum was indistinct, but appeared to undulate like that of the lower boundary
of Stratum I.
Stratum IlL Loose mixture of organics and dark brown clay loam; fewer
roots and rootlets and some small roof spalls; approximately 12 cm thick; sparse
cultural material. The lower boundary of this stratum abutted a large limestone
roof block (ca. 20 cm thick) that had fallen prior to deposition of Stratum III.
Feature 4 in Test Unit 3 was contained within this stratum.
Stratum IV. Gray loam just beneath the roof block; associated with several
large roots. This stratum was only observed in the central portion of the south
wall, immediately beneath the roof block. No cultural material could be deftnitely related to Stratum IV.
Stratum V. Dark brown clay loam; similar to Stratum III, but with less
organics and more compact; 30 to 40 cm thick; few small roots and rootlets and
some small roof spall; the overwhelming majority of cultural material from
Trinque came from this Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone. Both Darl
dart points and ScaUorn arrowpoints were recovered from this stratum. Features
2 (Test Unit 1) and 3 (Test Units 2 and 3) were also recognized in this stratum.
The pit associated with Feature 1 (the child burial) probably originated from this
stratum, although this was not conclusively determined. This zone appeared to
thicken east of Test Unit 1, toward the bulk of the Room A deposits.
Stratum VI. Light gray, sandy clay loam with scattered caliche pebbles;
some small roof spalls and rootlets; 20 to 35 cm thick; much less cultural material than in Stratum V. This stratum also appears to thicken toward the central
portion of Room A.
Stratum VII. Light gray/tan fine sandy clay loam with a high caliche content; some roof spall and rootlets; 15 to 30 cm thick; very sparse cultural
material, possibly deposited through bioturbation. This stratum appeared to
thicken to the west, away from the central portion of Room A. Feature 1 rested
within the top of this stratum, but the pit that contained it must have originated
from above. The upper portion of this stratum was much more compact than its
lower portion.
Stratum VIII. Solidified caliche/marl; very compact; sterile of cultural material; total thickness not determined.
TEST UNITS

Test Unit 1
This unit was carded to a depth of 1.25 meters before the caliche/marl rear
wall was encountered throughout the unit sloping toward the mouth of Room A.
This rear wall was f’u’st uncovered along the north wall of the unit at approximately 65 cm below surface (bs). Once exposed, the caliche/marl rear wall was
found to slope southward at a steady angle until exiting the unit along the south
wall at 1.25 meters. Thus, Test Unit 1 penetrated to the bottom of the floor

deposits in this area of Room A. One feature (Feature 2), a rock concentration,
was located within levels seven and eight.
Cultural material, including stone tools, lithic debitage, burned and unburned bone, mussel shell, and fire-cracked rock were recovered to about 90 cm
bs (Tables 6 and 7). Sparse cultural debris was encountered in the upper 30 cm,
but a fairly thick cultural zone was apparent between 30-60 cm bs. This zone is
referred to in this paper as the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone. Below
60 cm there was a paucity of cultural materials.

*Excavated as a 24 cm level
Test Unit 2

Test Unit 2 was carried only to a depth of 44 cm. As previously mentioned,
the primary purposes of the unit were to search for a pit outline for Feature 1 and
secure data on any possible associations with the feature. Once this was accomplished, the unit was finished and backf’dled. Thus, Test Unit 2 did not penetrate
to the bottom of the floor deposits in this area of the shelter.
The eastern half of the unit had been severely damaged by Disturbance #2.
The surface elevation at the southwest corner of the unit was 36 cm lower than
the surface elevation at the southeast corner of Test Unit 1. Since these two
points are only one meter apart, the upper portion of Test Unit 2 seems to have
either been removed during the excavation of Disturbance #2, or partially compacted by the path that has been used in accessing Room A. A rock concentration, Feature 3, was partially exposed in the southeast corner of levels 2 and 3 of
the unit. This feature (see below) continued into the northeast comer of Test Unit
3 and may be related to Feature 1, the child inhumation.
Level 1 in Test Unit 2 was removed as a 24 cm thick level to bring it to an
elevation consistent with those in Test Unit 1. The level 1 deposits here correspond in elevation to levels 5 and 6 in Test Unit 1, where the Late Archaic/Late
Prehistoric cultural zone was encountered. Cultural materials were recovered
from all three levels excavated in the unit, although the lowest level produced
very few items (Tables 8 and 9).

Test Unit 3
This unit was excavated to 1.04 meters in depth before hard-packed caliche/
marl was encountered throughout the unit. Backdirt from Disturbance #2 partially covered the unit prior to excavation. Feature 3, a rock concentration initially observed in Test Unit 2, extended into the northeast comer of the unit in
levels 4-6. A burned rock concentration in level 1 was designated Feature 4.
Excavations in the unit are thought to have penetrated to the bottom of the
cultural deposits, although conclusive evidence for this was not obtained.
Cultural materials were recovered throughout the unit deposits, although
little material was recovered below level 5 (Tables 10 and 11). The first four
levels are within Stratum V (see Figure 7), the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric
cultural zone. Scallorn and Darl projectile points were recovered from Test Unit
3. Level 7 was excavated as a 56 cm thick level because of diminishing artifacts
and time constraints.

BURIAL EXCAVATION
The burial was initially discovered under a large limestone slab that was in
contact with the skull of the infant. This stone was removed and discarded within
the room. Fortunately, Mr. Trinque took in situ photographs of the stone, which
was subsequently relocated, allowing its original position and elevation to be
determined. After uncovering the infant remains, he carefully placed soil, an
empty bag, and a few limestone rocks over the interment. Then, after more soil
was put down, a small wooden screen was placed in the disturbance and covered
with additional soil (Lance Trinque, 1991 personal communication).
The burial location was roughly centered within the room, being about the
same distance from the back wall and the edge of the overhang or dripline. Our
first task was to remove the overburden (approximately 50 cm) that had been
replaced following the original discovery. Once the skull fragments of the infant
were exposed, the relocated limestone slab was carefully replaced so that feature
elevations could be taken and a scale drawing completed.
FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS
Description of Feature 1
Feature 1 was an infant interment that had been placed in a tightly flexed
position on its left side ~igure 8). The infant was oriented in a west-southwesteast-northeast direction with the head to the west-southwest facing the rear wall
of the shelter. The arms were extended, with the hands apparently in the area of
the knees. The skull had been crushed by the weight of the limestone slab placed
directly above it.
Generally, the skeletal material was found to be quite fragile and had to be
treated with a polyvinyl acetate (PVA) solution before removal (see Appendix
1). The burial had been disturbed by both rodent activities and roots that displaced some of the vertebrae, one femur, the lower ribs, and the hands and feet.
No pit outline was observed above the inhumation, but a distinct color
change, roughly conforming to the shape of the infant, was discovered at the base
of the burial. This color change may represent the base of the grave pit or a stain
from some type of wrapping. Several limestone rocks at the same basal elevation
as the skeletal remains, were uncovered just to the east-southeast. Because of
their proximity to the inhumation, and the similar elevations, these stones are
thought to be associated with the interment.
No grave goods were encountered with this burial, but six animal bone
fragments (unidentified to species) and one small chunk of charcoal were uncovered within the matrix of the feature. The presence of the charcoal and animal
bones may be related to the root and rodent disturbances, to the grave backfilling,
or to the nearby possible hearth, Feature 3.

Description of Feature 2

An oval concentration of stones, some thermally altered, was discovered in
the north-central portion of Test Unit 1 at 60 cm bs. A total of 12 stones, only
four definitely cracked or discolored from thermal contact, comprise the feature.
In plan view, the feature is a fairly tight oval concentration that measures 52 cm x
20 cm, with a thickness of eight cm; once cross-sectioned, however, it had a
more amorphous jumbled appearance. A dark brown soil stain extended roughly
five to 10 cm around the south and west sides of the feature at its base. On the
north and northeast sides of the feature, the caliche/marl back wall of the shelter
had restricted this stain to the area immediately around the stones. The stained
soil was from two to four cm thick in the area away from the stones but no
evidence of a pit was obtained, as the edge of this soil had an indistinct boundary.
The varying rock depths, and their elongated shape in aggregate, suggest the
feature had either been disturbed or was in secondary context.
Description of Feature 3
A concentration of stones about 50 cm south of the child inhumation was
first discovered in the eastern half of Test Unit 2, in Level 2, at 29 cm bs. A total
of 26 stones, several of them thermally altered, comprise the feature ~igure 9).
In plan view, the feature appeared to be roughly oval, with several tight stone
concentrations located within it. The majority of stones in the feature were found
to have basal elevations between 40-45 cm bs. The largest stone, measuring
approximately 30 cm x 27 cm x 13 cm, lay within the central portion of the
feature. One possible modified hematite pebble was found just above this stone.
This relatively durable pebble had one flattened surface that may have been
created during the process of obtaining hematite pigment.
Description of Feature 4

A concentration of fire-cracked rocks was first exposed near the center of
Test Unit 3 in Level 1 at four cm bs. The concentration consisted of nine
thermally altered stones in two small adjacent clusters. The southernmost cluster
contained five stones while the northern one had four stones (including one
larger stone measuring approximately 30 cm x 20 cm). Overall, the feature
measured approximately 50 cm (north-northwest--south-southeast) by 30 cm
(west-southwest---east-northeast). The stones within both clusters were somewhat jumbled, suggesting they had been redeposited or severely disturbed. Despite the thermal alteration to the feature stones, no accompanying charcoal,
stained soil, or pit outline were present.
ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGE
A total of 1118 artifacts and 10 possible manuports were recovered in the
three test units at the Trinque site. The artifacts include stone tools and debitage,

Cloud and Smith m The Trinque Site

301

burned and unburned bone, and mussel shell fragments. Manuports, defined as
unmodified items that are not naturally present at the site and thus had to have
been brought to the site by man, include certain snail shells and casts of invertebrate fossils.
Projectile Points
Four Scallorn arrowpoints and three Darl dart points were found in our
excavations. All these artifacts are from Stratum V, the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone.
Scallorn arrowpoints were from Test Units 1 and 3. The three Scallorn
arrowpoints in Test Unit 1 were found from 30-60 cm bs. The t-n’st (30-40 cm
bs) has well-defined shoulders, a bifacially thinned straight base, and a strongly
expanding stem (see Figure 4h). The next (40-50 cm) is missing the distal half
of the blade and the distal ends of both barbs (see Figure 4a). The base is straight
and thinned on one face. The final example from Test Unit 1 is complete except
for tiny pieces of one barb and the distal blade tip (see Figure 4c). It also has an
offset convex base, short barbs, and a moderately expanding stem. The Scallorn
from Test Unit 3 (10-20 cm bs, but equivalent to level 5 in Test Unit 1) has an
expanding stem, straight base, and slight barbs, with most of the blade missing
(see Figure 4d).
The Darl dart points came from Test Units 2 and 3. The Test Unit 2 Darl
(24-34 cm bs) has a thick bullet-like blade and a reworked tip (see Figure 5c).
The stem expands slightly and the straight base has been appreciably thinned. All
blade edges exhibit some beveling, while the left stem edge has been beveled on
one face.
The ftrst Darl from Test Unit 3 (0-10 cm) is complete. It can be classified as
a Darl zephyr (Prewitt 1981) due to its steep lateral edge beveling and ground
stem edges (see Figure 5d). The blade is alternately beveled (the right edge of
both faces) and the blade tip is reworked, the stem is rectangular to square (and
alternately beveled on the left edges of both faces), the base is concave, and the
shoulders are weak. The second Darl (30-40 cm) is an extremely burned fragment (see Figure 5e). This artifact is missing the basal ears, one barb, and most of
the blade; the other barb is not well-defined.
Three chert projectile points were collected during backfilling of the Room
A disturbances: one Perdiz (see Figure 4j), one Scallorn fragment (see Figure
4b), and a Darl dart point (see Figure 5’0). The Perdiz is complete, but shows
signs of reworking as the barb areas have been rounded into shoulders and the
blade tip has a needle-like appearance. The Scallorn a.,xowpoint fragment is
missing the blade tip, both barb tips, and a portion of the expanding stem. The
Darl is complete except for one shoulder tip. This point is strongly beveled on the
left edge of both stem faces and the right edge of both blade faces, giving it a
twisted appearance.
Other formal tools found at Trinque included two arrowpoint fragments,
an arrowpoint preform fragment, two bifacial drill/perforator fragments, eleven

302

Texas Archeological Society

Cloud and Smith ~ The Trinque Site

303

biface fragments, two cores and six core fragments, a bone tool fragment, an
abraded hematite pebble, and a possible modified hematite pebble. All of these
artifacts are from the Late ArchaicA,ate Prehistoric cultural zone.
An arrowpoint fi’agment from Test Unit 1 (60-70 cm) is missing the right
barb, distal tip, and stem (see Figure 4g). Hinge fractures are evident on both the
distal tip and stem breaks. Although this fragment is not typeable, the barb
present and the blade edge/barb angle are suggestive of the Perdiz type. The
other arrowpoint fragment is a distal piece (Test Unit 1, 30-40 cm).
A bifacially worked arrowpoint preform fragment was found at 60-70 Cm in
Test Unit 1. This fragment appears to be a preform to a Scallorn arrowpoint (see
Figure 4e).
Two bifacial perforator/drill fragments were recovered in Test Unit 3 (both
from 0-10 cm). One has most of the edge damage on the right lateral edges of
both faces (Figure 10a), while the other has edge damage mainly on the left
lateral edge of both faces (Figure 10b).
The first biface fragment is a medial section of a dart point or knife preform
from Test Unit 1 (40-50 cm) (Figure 10h). The other biface from this provenience is severely burned and fragmented; thus, its original morphology is unknown.
Test Unit 3 had nine biface fragments: four in level 1 (0-10 cm), one in level
2 (10-20 cm), three in level 3 (20-30 cm), and one in level 4 (30-40 cm). Of the
four level 1 biface fragments, one is the medial section of a knife (Figure 10j),
another is a probable arrowpoint preform, one is a probable dart point stem
fragment, and the last is a small burned ovoid piece.
The level 2 specimen appears to be a Darl preform (see Figure 5a). It has an
elongated triangular shape with one rounded basal corner intact. It has been
basally thinned, but its thickness (6.14 mm) is not consistent with a finished tool.
The level 3 biface fragments include a medial fragment of a probable dart
point or knife, a specimen with a used edge, and a very crude bifacial piece. The
level 4 fragment is a thin reworked distal fragment that was probably part of an
arrowpoint or knife.
The two cores were of a multidirectional form. The one from Test Unit 1
(40-50 cm) has a cube-like shape (Figure 10g) with one convex scoop-shaped
edge with tiny use-wear scars. The other (from Test Unit 3, 10-20 cm) has been
depleted of useable flakes (Figure 10f). Core fragments were recovered from the
three test units, with four in Test Unit 1 (one from 30-40 cm and three from 50-60
cm), and one each in the other two test units (24-34 cm in Test Unit 2 and 10-20
cm in Test Unit 3). Figure 10c and 10d illustrate two of the recovered core
fragments.
Two other probable stone tools consist of an abraded hematite pebble
(Figure 10i) and a possible modified hematite pebble (Figure 10e). The abraded
hematite pebble (Test Unit 1, 50-60 cm) has three relatively flat facets, two of
which have numerous striations. The striations randomly arc or curve across the
facets; their curvature suggest that a circular motion was used in the abrading

304

Texas Archeological Society

process. The possible modified hematite pebble (Test Unit 3, 30-40 cm) is 3.5 cm
x 3.5 cm x 3 cm in length, width, and thickness, is relatively heavy (48.5 g), and
has a 2.4 x 1.9 cm fiat facet. The facet is generally smooth, with about half of the
surface irregular due to thermal alteration. No striations were visible under 30X
magnification, although probable polishing marks were present on a few high
spots. This artifact was associated with Feature 3, and may also have some
relationship to Feature 1, the child burial.
Other Stone, Bone, and Shell Artifacts

Edge-modified lithics were common at Trinque, with 207 recovered in the
limited excavations (55 in Test Unit 1, 11 in Test Unit 2, and 141 in Test Unit 3).
These informal tools have been modifed mostly from use wear, although several
have been trimmed as well. The overwhelming majority of these artifacts were
recovered in the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone.
Unmodified debitage and burned lithic items were also found at the site.
Included in the debitage were two primary flakes, 92 secondary flakes, 162
tertiary flakes, and 250 chips and chunks. The dearth of primary flakes suggests
that initial reduction of lithic raw materials generally occurred at the source or
quarry. The 56 burned lithic items are thermally altered to the point where they
cannot be placed in any of the unmodifed debitage categories.
A total of 197 faunal specimens came from our excavations. Most of these
were recovered in the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone. Since many of
the faunal specimens are fragments without articulated ends, they were not
identifiable to the species level. One bone tool fragment was recovered (Test
Unit 3, 0-10 cm). It has the shape suggestive of the butt end of an awl. The tool
was made from an unidentified mammalian long bone fragment (probably an
Artiodactyal) that was split longitudinally before being shaped with a piece of
sandstone or some other abrasive material; particularly evident are several shaped
facets on the butt end. Both the interior and exterior surfaces of the tool have
shallow grooves related to tool shaping. All of the surfaces appear to have been
subsequently polished, probably with leather. Additionally, the bone may have
been purposefully or accidentally thermally altered.
A total of 107 mussel shell fragments were recovered from our work at
Trinque. Almost all of these came from the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone, except for a few shell fragments found immediately below this zone;
it is unclear whether these fragments relate to an earlier occupation or were
redeposited from the overlying primary cultural zone.
Ten possible manuports were identified from the site: two invertebrate
marine fossils and eight fossilized snail shells. Both invertebrate fossils and five
of the fossilized snail shells were found in the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric
cultural zone; the other three fossilized snail shells were found just beneath this
zone. The invertebrate marine fossils (both from Test Unit 1, 30-40 cm) resemble
bear claws in shape.

THE TRINQUE COLLECTION

Lance Trinque has 50 lithic artifacts from the site. These consist of 24
arrowpoints, six arrowpoint fragments, one arrowpoint preform, 17 dart points,
and two dart point fragments.
The arrowpoint assemblage is dominated by the ScaUorn type (17 specimens), with Perdiz (two specimens), Bonham (two specimens), Washita-like
(one specimen), Alba-like (one specimen), and Steiner-like (one specimen) also
represented (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985). All of the
arrowpoints and arrowpoint fragments were recovered from the upper 30 cm of
the deposit (Lance Trinque, 1990 personal communication).
The dart points in this collection consist of the Darl type (four specimens),
possible Darl (one specimen), Ensor (one specimen), Frio (one specimen), Image
(two specimens), Marshall (one specimen), Palmillas (two specimens),
Pedernales (three specimens), Gower-like (one specimen), and one small untyped
specimen (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985). These dart points
were found stratigraphically below the arrowpoints from approximately 30 cm to
120 cm below the surface (Lance Trinque, 1990 personal communication). Six
medial and distal biface fragments were found from approximately 120 cm to
137 cm below the surface, but no diagnostic artifacts were secured from these
hard-packed lower deposits.
FAUNAL ANALYSIS
A total of 197 faunal fragments were recovered from the Trinque Site investigations, only one of which was a bone tool. Fifteen specimens were identified to order (Chelonia, Rodentia, Lefomorpha, and Artiodactyal) and nine of
these were identified to the family level (Testudinidae, Cricetidae, LePoridae,
and Ruminantia). Seven specimens could be identified to the species level, including Pseudemys sp. Gray, Sylvilagus spp. Gray, and Odocoileus virginianus
(Zimmermann). Three specimens were identified as Sylvilagus spp. (cottontail
rabbits), three as Odocoileus virginianus (white-tail deer), one as Pseudemys sp.
(slider turtle), one as an unidentified Emydinae turtle (hardshell turtle), five as
unidentified Artiodactyals, and two as unidentified Cricetine rodents (small rats).
Four of the unidentified Artiodactyal specimens are from broken metapodial
fragments (of equal length) that fit together. They show no intentional shaping,
but are strikingly similar in the location of the break of the piece. These specimens possibly represent preforms for some type of bone tool.
Over 51 percent of the 197 faunal specimens have been burned and several
of these also have possible butcher marks. Two of the identified specimens, one
of the Sylvilagus spp. specimens and the Pseudemys sp. specimen, were burned.
These specimens could have been intentionally burned during the cooking process or they may have been tossed into the fire after a meal was finished.

DISCUSSION OF THE SITE AND
ITS CULTURAL CONTEXT

Although test units at the rockshelter did not reveal deeply stratified deposits,
they established that a fairly thick (approximately 30-40 cm) cultural zone existed
in the upper deposits of the shelter. This zone appears to span the end of the Late
Archaic to the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period. Unfortunately, mixing of
this zone prohibited its separation into discrete cultural components. The lack of
identif’mble stratigraphic breaks is probably the result of various bioturbative and
erosive actions.
All four of the cultural features uncovered from Trinque are associated with
this zone. These four features consist of two possible hearths (Features 2 and 4),
the infant burial (Feature 1), and a stone concentration (Feature 3) adjacent to the
burial. All of these features are thought to date to the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric time period represented by the thick cultural zone in the upper deposits at
the site. Features 2 and 4 appear to be disturbed hearths or hearth remnants that
may have been dumped from another location.
The burial cannot be confidently related to a specific time period due to the
lack of associated diagnostic artifacts and an undefinable burial pit. The burial
was found just below the Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone, but it is impossible to stratigraphically define the interment’s position without a burial pit
outline traceable to the stratigraphic level of its origin. The position of the burial
relative to the cultural zone above it, however, suggests that the inhumation is
likely associated with the middle to upper portion of the zone (or possibly with
the shallow deposits above the zone). These associations, unlike the lower portion of the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone, would at least allow for
a sufficient burial depth to prevent animal or inadvertent human disturbances.
Thus, the burial is thought to date to either the terminal end of the Late Archaic
period or to the earlier part of the Late Prehistoric period.
Feature 3, the rock concentration located just above and south of the child
interment (see Figure 9), was composed of both fire-cracked rocks and thermally
unaltered stones. The lack of intense burning of the stones in the feature may be
explained by several possible scenarios. Either the feature is a disturbed hearth
that was only used for a short period, where most of the stones were not subjected to intense heat, or the stones were gathered and placed there as part of a
cairn with several burned stones having been fortuitously added to the pile. In
either case, the feature appears to have been subsequently disturbed. The proximity of the feature to the child inhumation does suggest a relationship between
these cultural phenomena, however.
Several factors point toward a relationship between Feature 3 and Feature
1, namely: the horizontal juxtaposition of these two features, the similar elevations, and the presence of a possible modified red hematite pebble in Feature 3.
These two features are only approximately 50 cm apart horizontally and are
vertically separated by less than 10 cm. The top of the slab that covered the

Cloud and Smith ~ The Trinque Site

307

child inhumation had an elevation consistent with the elevations recorded for
Feature 3. The possible modified hematite pebble in Feature 3 is the type of
artifact often associated with aboriginal burials in North America and interments
from the Upper Paleolithic in Eurasia, and its presence lends credence to a possible relationship between these features. The following discussion considers this
relationship in more detail.
Use of Red Paint, Red Ochre, and Fire in Human Interments
Red paint, often obtained from grinding hematite pebbles, and red ochre
have been documented at a number of Upper Paleolithic sites in Eurasia (Harrold
1980). They have been reported as occurring in burials, art and non-mortuary
ritual contexts, and domestic contexts (Roper 1991:290). Red paint and ochre
was found with 35 of 67 Upper Paleolithic interments throughout Eurasia
(Harrold 1980:206), and recorded in almost all of the burials from this time period
in the Soviet Union (Roper 1991:291). According to Roper (1991:292-293), red
paint was used in both the cave paintings of western Europe and on portable art
objects, such as animal representations, figurines, and mammoth bones, throughout Eurasia at this time. In addition, red ochre has been found with great regularity on living floors of Upper Paleolithic habitation sites. Roper (1991) also
presented data on the context of ochre occurrences from a number of North
American Paleoindian sites, and suggested its use in this hemisphere was the
product of a long tradition with roots in Eurasia.
The presence of red ochre or hematite pigment at sites- and its use in aboriginal burials -is well documented in North America as well. During the
Paleoindian period in North America, for example, red ochre has been associated with burials (Jenks 1937; Anderson 1966; Lahren and Bonnichsen 1974;
Redder 1985b; Redder and Fox 1988), has been reported covering artifacts such
as cached specimens (Buffer 1963; Frison 1990) and grinding stones (Naze 1986;
Roper 1989, 1991; Meyer and Liboiron 1990), and has been located on a number of living surfaces (Alexander 1963; Jodry and Stanford 1988; Bonnichsen et
al. 1990). Clearly, the use of ochre by Paleoindians in North America is parallel
to the use of this substance during the Upper Paleolithic in Eurasia, and probably represents an extension of that tradition (Roper 1991).
In Texas, red ochre has been reported from a number of archeological sites
occupied throughout prehistory. Its use appears to be common at sites in the
central Brazos valley, and moreover, the use of red ochre at sites and in burials
is a long-standing Native American tradition in the state.
The use of red ochre during Paleoindian times has been documented at
several Texas sites in both campsite (Alexander 1963) and burial associations
(Redder 1985b; Redder and Fox 1988). Redder (1985b:43) reported "one 3-in.square fragment of very fine red ochre" from the double burial at Horn Shelter
No. 2 in eastern Bosque County. This artifact had faceted surfaces and numerous visible striations and was found beneath the left temple of the adult in the
interment (Redder and Fox 1988:8).

River Valley, again in campsite (Lynott 1978:43; Forrester 1985:32) and burial
(Hall 1981) contexts. At the Ernest Witte site (41AU36) in the lower Brazos
River valley, Hall (1981:182) found a strong association between Late Archaic
burials and the use of red ochre. Nineteen of the Group 2 burials at the site had
powdered or finely granulated ochre in association, with most of these having
ochre in the head and chest areas.
Late Prehistoric sites with red ochre have been found in North Central (Jelks
1962) and East (Jackson 1938) Texas. At the Kyle site, "fragments of hematite
(a total of 37 pieces) were found in all of the occupational levels reported" (Jelks
1962:59). Jackson (1938) noted that a number of Caddoan burials in East Texas
have had red ochre in association. In general, the sites discussed by Jackson
(1938) were occupied during the Late Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1400-1680). At
the Mattie Gandy site (41FK4), for example, four pieces of red ochre were found
in association with 90 ceramic vessels (Jackson 1938:105).
Red ochre has also been reported from an Historic Indian burial in the
central Brazos River valley (Story 1985). This interment from the Walton site
in McLennan County had "bits of vermillion" in association (Story 1985:71).
The use of paint in mortuary practices has been well documented ethnographically for historic Indian groups throughout North America (Yarrow 1988).
In these accounts, paint (usually red) was applied to the body, hair, or face of
the corpse and occasionally applied to the faces of the mourners. The Creek and
Seminole Indians of Florida painted the bodies of deceased warriors an unspecified color before burial, while the Pueblo Indians of San Geronimo de Taos used
red vermilion and white chalk paint to adorn the bodies of both sexes after death
(Yarrow 1988:4, 7). The Wah-Peton and Sisseton Sioux of the Dakota Territory
also used red paint in their mortuary practices. After death, warriors of these
tribes were painted red across the mouth, or in the case of especially brave men,
"they paint a hand in black color, with the thumb on one side of the mouth and
the fingers separated on the other cheek, the rest of the face being painted red"
(Yarrow 1988:10). Prior to death, women and children of these tribes who were
expected to die often had their faces painted red. When this could not be done
before death it was done soon afterwards. In addition, males of these groups
usually painted their faces an unspecified color during the mourning period.
Another group that painted the face of the deceased red or yellow was the
Kiowa Apache of Oklahoma and Texas (Yarrow 1988:33). The Werowance
Indians of Virginia and the Congaree or Santee Indians of South Carolina used
red paint on the bodies of the deceased, with the South Carolina tribe additionally applying red paint to the hair of the dead (Yarrow 1988:23). These examples
show that some of the historic Native American groups used paint, especially
red paint, as an important aspect of their mortuary practices.
The possible connection between Feature 1 and Feature 3 is further strengthened by an understanding of another aspect of Native American mortuary customs, namely the use of fire. Cremations, as well as by-products of fire, such as

Cloud and Smith ~ The Trinque Site

309

charcoal, ash, thermally altered stones, and charred food remains, have been
reported from a number of aboriginal burials in Texas (Ray 1936; Morrow 1936;
Jackson 1938; Jelks 1962; Stephenson 1970; Lynott 1978; Hall 1981), and historic accounts mention cremations and the use of fire in many Native North
American interments (Yarrow 1988). One of the earliest occurrences of fire byproducts in a North American aboriginal burial dates to the Paleoindian period
(Anderson 1966). Fire apparently played an important role in the mortuary practices of quite a number of Native American groups.
Jackson (1938:77-113) reported numerous cremated burials and burials associated with charcoal, ash, and charred food remains in an article entitled "Fire
in East Texas Burial Rites." He described six probable cremations from a site in
Titus County that had substantial associated deposits of ash and charcoal. He
also described a number of interments where charcoal or ash deposits were associated with inhumations that had not been cremated or otherwise burned. Some
of these cases involved charcoal in or beneath pottery vessels, but in most instances he described ash, charcoal, or both scattered throughout the burial fill
(Jackson 1938:106-107). Additionally, Jackson described several interments
where charred food remains (deer bones, pecans, kidney beans, and corn cobs)
were found in association with the body.
Fire associated with human interments has been documented at three sites
in nearby Hill County (Jelks 1962; Stephenson 1970; Lynott 1978). At the Kyle
Site, two of the three recovered burials showed evidence of fh’e. One of these
interments was cremated with the charred bone fragments wrapped in an
unwoven fiber mat, while the other was flexed and had been covered with pieces
of burned limestone (Jelks 1962:19-21). Another example of a fire/human burial
relationship comes from a child burial from the Pictograph Shelter at Lake
Whitney. An intense fire that consumed to ash all but the top few pieces of
firewood was apparently built in the burial pit prior to the inhumation. Other
evidence suggested this fire was doused with a heavy, greasy liquid and that the
fire was cold when the burial occurred. This burial was thought to be affiliated
with the Toyah phase component at the site (Stephenson 1970:124). At Bear
Creek Shelter, the only burial uncovered had two small concentrations of burned
rock and charcoal in close proximity. These features were not firmly associated;
however, the location of these concentrations beneath the head and slightly above
and west of the body suggest some sort of relationship. All of these features
were exposed within the Transitional Archaic Occupation Zone II (Lynott
1978:28). The juxtaposition of the burned rock and charcoal concentration just
above and west of this interment is very similar to that of Feature 3 and the
child inhumation at the Trinque Site.
Historic accounts document the use of cremations in burial ceremonies
performed by several North American Indian groups. Cremations were observed
being practiced in this country by several groups, including the Nishinams of
California, the Bonaks of an unknown location, the Tolkotins of Oregon, the
Indians of Clear Lake, California, the Se-nel of California, and the Pitt River or

310

Texas Archeological Society

Achomawi of California (Yarrow 1988). Closer to home, the Coahuiltecan tribes
of South and Southwest Texas were observed practicing cremations on certain
individuals, perhaps shamans, as ordinary persons were buried outside the encampment (Newcomb 1961:51); other historic Indian groups in Texas probably
used this mortuary practice as well.
The aboriginal custom of building fires on or near graves was a practice
that was observed and reported during historic times by several authors
(Newcomb 1961; Yarrow 1988). Yarrow explained that the custom provided a
certain purification for the soul, helped drive away demons, or helped light the
way to the spirit land for the wandering soul (Yarrow 1988:82). The Algonkins
of the northeastern United States, the Yukon of California, and the Eskimo of
Canada and Alaska either lit a fire nightly or kept one burning for a specific
time period to accomplish this end. Yarrow (1988:13) also presented a 1794
account of an exposed grave in New York which states "... near the place where
the head lay were the traces of a fire which they had kindled for the soul of the
deceased to come and warm itself by and to partake of the food deposited near
it." In Fray Francisco Casafias’ descriptions of the Tejas or Hasinai Indians in
East Texas from 1691 to 1722, an account was given of an interment where fire
was used. In describing this burial Newcomb (1961:302) relates that "After the
mourners had wept over the closed grave, some left to fetch tobacco, fire, and
a pot of water to be left on the grave." Thus, the association of fires and aboriginal graves appears to be a well documented one that probably had its origins
deep in man’s past.
The discussion above provides support for a possible circumstantial relationship between Feature 3 and Feature 1. A case for such a relationship has
been made based on: (1) the occurrence of a possible modified hematite pebble
in Feature 3, (2) the proximity of the two features, and (3) the identification of
Feature 3 as a possible hearth. The use of red paint and fires in the mortuary
practices of Native Americans during historic and prehistoric times has also been
shown to have been fairly common.
Other Features

Feature 2, interpreted as a hearth or hearth remnant, was uncovered just
above the bottom of the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone. Only four
of the 12 stones that comprise it were fire-cracked or visibly discolored from
thermal alteration, but several charcoal chunks and flecks were found in association. The time required for stones to crack or become discolored from thermal contact depends on a number of factors, including type of stone, moisture
content, temperature, and distance from the heat source. It is possible that some
of the stones in Feature 2 are hearth stones that never cracked or became discolored, due to the aforementioned circumstances. The presence of charcoal and
the stained soil observed around the feature argue for this stone concentration
being a disturbed hearth. The stones in the feature were jumbled as if they had
been kicked or piled together, with the four thermally altered stones located at

Cloud and Smith m The Trinque Site

311

varying depths in the approximate feature center. Such a configuration suggests
the feature had been disturbed after being used. The depth of Feature 2, just
above the base of the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric cultural zone, indicates this
feature is probably associated with the Late Archaic component at the site.
The fire-cracked rock concentration designated Feature 4 was exposed quite
high in the upper cultural zone (Late Archaic!Late Prehistoric) at the site. This
feature lacks the characteristics of an in situ hearth, such as charcoal, associated
stained soil, a pit outline, or a definable hearth morphology, and thus it is thought
to be redeposited burned rock. The cultural affiliation of this feature is problematic as the diagnostic artifacts both above and below it reflect the mixed nature
of the deposit in this zone. A Darl dart point was recovered from above the feature
and a probable Darl dart point preform came from the level below it. Additionally, a Scallorn arrowpoint and several probable arrowpoint fragments came from
the approximate level of the feature and the levels below it.
Artifact Assemblage Comparisons
The artifacts from the Trinque Site, including diagnostic and non-diagnostic
tools, bone, lithic debitage, mussel shell, and possible manuports permit a few
generalizations about prehistoric activities at the site. The diagnostic artifacts
(projectile points) from the site support a considerable aboriginal presence during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, with at least some occupation
as early as the Middle Archaic. Diagnostic artifacts from earlier periods were not
recovered in our limited investigations, but may be contained in hard-packed
deposits in certain areas of the site as suggested by the Trinque excavations.
The Late Prehistoric diagnostics from the Trinque Site are dominated by 22
Scallorn and Scallorn-like arrowpoints, commonly associated with the Austin
phase of the Late Prehistoric period in Central Texas (Jelks 1962:84-99; Prewitt
1981:82-83). Recently estimated ages of the Austin phase vary from A.D. 7001200 (Turner and Hester 1985:189) to A.D. 700-1300 (Prewitt 1981:83). Other
Late Prehistoric diagnostic arrowpoints from the site consist of two Perdiz, two
Bonham, one Washita-like, one Alba-like, and one Steiner-like. The relatively
few numbers of these diagnostics at the site suggest they represent short term use
at other times or trade items. Perdiz arrowpoints are typically associated with the
Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric period in Central Texas (Jelks 1962:84-99;
Prewitt 1981:83-84). The Toyah phase, sequent to the Austin phase, has been
variously estimated to date from A.D. 1200-1500 (Turner and Hester 1985:187)
to A.D. 1300-1750 (Prewitt 1981:84).
It should be noted that the presence of certain diagnostic projectile points
by themselves is not sufficient evidence of affiliation with a given archeological
phase (Johnson 1987). Phases are regional representations of an ethnic group or
a single society during a given time period. Although phases are generally defined
on the presence of stylistically unique tools, clothing, etc., other behaviors, such
as economic pursuits and mortuary practices, should also be considered (Johnson
1987:3). Stylistically unique artifacts, such as Scallorn and Perdiz arrowpoints,

312

Texas Archeological Society

are often attributed to the Austin and Toyah phases, respectively, when no other
cultural traits of those phases are found in direct association. Although these
two phases have been mentioned in this report, it should be noted that testing at
the Trinque Site provided insufficient data for a definite affiliation with either
of these phases.
The other four arrowpoint types from the site represent varieties that are
commonly associated with cultures in areas adjacent to Central Texas. Bonham
arrowpoints, normally found in North Central and Northeast Texas, have been
estimated to date from A.D. 800-1200 (Suhm and Jelks 1962:267), but have also
been theorized to be stylistically related to Perdiz arrovcpoints and perhaps
pointing toward an affiliation with the Toyah phase (Jelks 1962:33). No firm
radiocarbon dates have been secured at this time for Bonham arrowpoints. Alba
arrowpoints are usually found in East Texas, and less commonly in North Central
to Central Texas (Suhm and Jelks 1962:263). These arrowpoints are thought to
date between A.D. 800-1200 (Turner and Hester 1985:163), so the Alba-like
specimen from the Trinque Site may be associated with the Scallorn component
present there. At the nearby Kyle Site in Hill County, only two Alba arrowpoints
were recovered from the extensive remains of the Austin and Toyah phases. One
of those came from the Austin phase zone, while the other was from the mixed
zone between those phases (Jelks 1962:33). Washita arrowpoints are the characteristic projectiles of the Washita phase in Oklahoma (Bell 1958:98-99; Turner
and Hester 1985:195). In Texas, this arrowpoint type commonly occurs in the
Panhandle and in the northern portion of the state, and has been recently dated
between A.D. 1150-1500 at Landergin Mesa in Oldham County (Robert J.
Mallouf, 1993 personal communication). Steiner arrowpoints, normally found in
East Texas, have as their characteristic attribute a deeply serrated triangular
blade (Story 1965:183-185; Turner and Hester 1985:191). Unfortunately, Steiner
arrowpoints have not been related to a specific culture or phase and the affiliation
of the Steiner-like specimen from the Trinque Site remains problematic.
The recovered dart points from the Trinque Site are dominated by the Darl
type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:179-180; Turner and Hester 1985:84); a total of nine
Darl and Darl-like dart points were secured from the Lance Trinque and our
excavations. This dart point type, common in Central Texas westward to the
Lower Pecos and southeastward onto the coastal plain, has been dated to approximately A.D. 200 by Turner and Hester (1985:84). The Darl component at
the Trinque Site, along with the later Scallorn component, comprise the primary
constituents of the upper cultural zone delineated at the site.
Other dart point types recovered from the site consist of one Frio, one Ensor,
two Lange, one Marshall, two Palmillas, four Pedernales, and one Gower-like
specimen (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985). Both Ensor and Frio
dart points are commonly found in Central and South Texas and date from approximately 200 B.C. to A.D. 600 ~umer and Hester 1985:94,100). Since our
excavations at the Trinque Site did not recover Ensor or Frio dart points, it is

Cloud and Smith ~ The Trinque Site

313

impossible to determine what relationship, if any, they had to the upper cultural
zone delineated at the site.
Lange dart points date to the Late Archaic period. They are found primarily in Central Texas, but also occur in the central coastal plain (Turner and Hester
1985:113). At the Greenhaw Site in Central Texas, Weir (1979:46) reports horizontally discrete components clustered about nine burned rock middens, with
Lange dart points associated with the San Marcos phase of the Late Archaic
period (ca. 850 B.C.-A.D. 150).
Marshall dart points, also associated with the San Marcos phase of the Late
Archaic period at the Greenhaw Site, are found primarily in Central Texas (Weir
1979). However, other researchers have placed Marshall points within the Middle
Archaic period, dating them at 1000 B.C. or earlier (Turner and Hester 1985:119).
This dart point type may have persisted over a lengthy time period, thus crosscutting the Middle/Late Archaic division.
Palmillas dart points, found in a broad area from East Texas to the TransPecos, are thought to date to the Christian era (Suhm and Jelks 1962:229-230).
Pedernales dart points, one of the most ubiquitous projectile points from the
Archaic period, are present from Central Texas to the Trans-Pecos region (Suhm
and Jelks 1962:235-237; Turner and Hester 1985:139-140). These dart points
are the primary markers of the Middle Archaic period in Central Texas, roughly
dated from 2250-650 B.C. (Weir 1979:46). Among the Archaic dart points recovered at the Trinque Site, the Pedernales type was second in frequency only
to the Darl type.
Gower dart points, originally defined by Shafer (1963:64) and commonly
found in South Central and Central Texas, are an Early Archaic form thought to
date approximately between 6000-4000 B.C. (Turner and Hester 1985:105).
Thus, the Gower-like dart point unearthed in the Trinque excavations is the
earliest diagnostic recovered from the site.
The number and variety of dart points from the site suggest a long period
of intermittent occupations during the Archaic period. The limited testing data
at the Trinque Site indicates that the site was most heavily occupied during the
Middle Archaic and end of the Late Archaic period.
The non-diagnostic tools recovered from the site can be used to examine
changes in site function through time. The relative absence of formal tools,
excluding projectile points, and the predominance of informal expediency tools
in the lithic assemblage from the site is quite striking. Although the site excavations did recover non-diagnostic formal tools, such as cores, drills or perforators, large biface fragments that probably represent knives, a bone awl, and an
abraded hematite pebble fragment, the relative number of these tools is quite
low. Conversely, a total of 207 edge-modified lithic items were recovered from
our investigations. Spread throughout the excavated levels at the site, these informal tools are flakes, chips, and chunks that have been either utilized as they
were or trimmed for use. The low density of formal tools, and the relatively

314

Texas Archeological Society

high density of expediency tools at the site, suggest that the site probably served
as a hunting camp or short term occupation during most, if not all, of its occupation.
At the Kyle Site in nearby Hill County, 484 "spall scrapers" were recovered from extensive excavations (Jelks 1962:51). These distinctive artifacts
apparently are synonymous with the edge-modified lithics from the Trinque Site.
Small, delicate flakes were removed from the working edges of these tools during
use, creating a beveled edge on one face with a combination of convex, concave, or straight working edges. Jelks (1962:51) found wood shavings in the dry
portions of the Kyle rockshelter, and after conducting experiments in the laboratory, felt that these informal tools "... were most likely used for dressing
down bows, arrow shafts, and other wooden artifacts." Although we did not
conduct experiments aimed at replication, we assume that items other than wood
may also have been scraped or cut with these items.
Use of Raw Materials
Examination of the diagnostic artifacts from Trinque suggests trends in the
lithic sources utilized during the occupation of the site. The lithic materials used
at the Trinque Site consist of local Edwards chert, either Central Texas (nonlocal) Edwards chert, or chert from a local gravel deposit found in the terraces of
the Brazos River valley near Lake Proctor in Comanche County (Larry Banks,
1992 personal communication), and a relatively small sample of petrified wood.
The local Edwards chert is gray to light gray in color, and dominates the lithic
assemblage at the site. This is especially the case from the Late Archaic/Late
Prehistoric cultural zone; however, non-local Edwards chert or the large, finegrained chert gravels near Lake Proctor were utilized to a much greater extent
during most of the Archaic period occupation at the site. Petrified wood apparently was a minor lithic material variety used throughout all occupations.
Faunal Remains

The faunal material from the limited excavations suggests that a broad
range of animals were exploited at or near the site during its occupation. Remains
from a slider turtle (Pseudemys sp.), cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an unidentified Emydinae turtle (Hardshell
turtle), unidentified Cricetine rodents (small rats), and unidentified Artiodactyals
were found in the site deposits.
The upper cultural zone at the site contained the majority of the identified
faunal material. All of the cottontail rabbit, unidentified Cricetine rodents, and
the unidentified Emydinae turtle remains came from this zone. Also present
within this zone were one of the white-tailed deer specimens and two unidentified
Artiodactyal specimens. Five identified specimens came from the first 10-cm
level just below the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric zone: these include two whitetailed deer specimens, two unidentified Artiodactyal specimens, and the only

Cloud and Smith ~ The Trinque Site

315

slider turtle specimen. The only other identified specimen, from an unidentified
Artiodactyal, came from the deepest deposits at the site.
Although the data are extremely limited, they suggest that small mammals
such as rabbits and rats were utilized to a greater extent during Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric times than during any earlier occupations of the site. The
one bone tool fragment seen in the assemblage is probably part of a bone awl.
This finely-crafted specimen undoubtedly took a substantial amount of time to
manufacture and was probably used to sew hides or furs together.
Chronological Synthesis and Site Use
The Trinque Site was occupied from Middle Archaic times, or earlier, until
approximately the end of the Late Prehistoric period. Excavation has shown that
aboriginal use of the site was its highest during the Late Archaic and the Late
Prehistoric periods. Comparisons of the use of the Trinque Site with the nearby
Kyle Site (Jelks 1962) should allow for some generalizations about occupational
use of the site.
The Kyle Site is located up a short tributary canyon system to the Brazos
River and was used throughout much of prehistory, including intensive occupations during both the Austin and Toyah phases. Jelks (1962) used the site, in
conjunction with several other sites with good stratigraphic integrity, to suggest
preliminary definitions of the Austin and Toyah phases in Central Texas. The
cultural deposits from both phases, including a wide array of perishable artifacts, suggest the site was used and reused through the Late Prehistoric period,
probably as a base camp. The size of the Kyle Rockshelter (27 x 12 meters), and
its location near the Brazos River, were probably key factors favoring a longterm intensive use during this period.
In comparing the Trinque Site to the Kyle Site, several important aspects
need to be considered. The two shelters are in similar environmental settings, at
canyon heads, but differ greatly in their relative size and in their respective
distances to major water sources. The Trinque Site rockshelter is a low, shallow
shelter, markedly smaller than the Kyle rockshelter, and also located in more of
an upland setting. Its size probably only allowed use by a relatively small group
at any given time, whereas the vastness of the Kyle shelter could accommodate
a much larger group. The location of the Kyle Site provided its inhabitants easy
access to the Brazos River, while the aborigines at the Trinque Site had to travel
a much greater distance to reach a major water source. Thus, one would expect
the aboriginal utilizations of these two sites during any given time period to be
different.
The excavation data, although limited from the Trinque Site, suggests differences in site functions. While the Kyle Site deposits have large numbers of
artifacts and a broad range of artifact types, the material culture from Trinque is
much more limited in quantity and variety. The material culture from Kyle consisted of over 600 bifacial lithic tools (including over 400 projectile points and

316

Texas ArcheologicaI Society

fragments, 78 knives, five drills, and numerous biface fragments), 10 scrapers,
almost 500 spall scrapers, one chopper, 12 hammerstones, 11 manos, four grinding slabs, one grooved stone, 11 painted pebbles, 49 pottery sherds, 51 bone
implements, 22 other bone objects, 33 antler pieces, two wooden arrow shafts,
100 other wooden artifacts, five pieces of basketry and matting, three pieces of
cordage, one knotted leaf, one shell scraper, five perforated mussel shells, and
three pieces of tanned leather (Jelks 1962). This diverse list of artifacts contrasts with the sparse artifacts from the Trinque site: 23 bifacial lithic tools, nine
cores and core fragments, 207 edge-modifed lithics (synonomous with the Kyle
site spall scrapers), one bone tool fragment, one abraded hematite pebble, and
one possibly modified hematite pebble. Although similarities exist in the material culture between the two sites, especially during the Late Prehistoric period,
the differences suggest different activities occurred at the respective sites. The
Kyle Site was probably a base camp with extended occupations through time,
while the Trinque Site more than likely served as a hunting camp or short term
stopover for small groups. The child inhumation ~eature 1) would not normally
have occurred during use of the site as a hunting camp, but could have resulted
during a short stay by a family group.
In conclusion, limited test excavations at the Trinque Site recorded four
cultural features that are thought to be associated with a buried cultural zone in
the upper portion of the deposit. This zone contains materials that date from the
end of the Late Archaic period to the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period.
Unfortunately, mixing of this zone in the tested area, through bioturbation and
weathering processes, has destroyed much of the integrity of the deposit. However, it is possible that stratified deposits exist in other portions of the rockshelter
where natural processes have not been as destructive. While a definite cultural
association for the infant inhumation was not established, the investigation did
provide archeological information for the Chalk Mountain area of Erath County,
an area previously neglected. In addition, this small field project provided an
opportunity for cooperation between professional and avocational archeologists
that strengthened the archeological data base for the area and region.
APPENDIX 1

BRIEF ANALYSIS OF SKELETAL REMAINS FROM THE
TRINQUE SITE (41ER27)
Patricia M. Landau and Gail A. Colby
The eruption and developmental state of the dentition from Burial 1 indicates that this individual was between eight and nine months old + three months

Cloud and Smith m The Trinque Site

317

at the time of death. It is not possible to estimate its stature or gender. This
estimate is based on the eruption and development of the dentition (Ubelaker
1978).
The overall preservation of Burial 1 is good. The recovery of subadult
skeletal material is problematic due to the fragility of the material, but the on-site
use of preservative (polyvinyl acetate) during excavation allowed the recovery of
elements that would otherwise not have been removed. The polyvinyl acetate
(PVA) was removed in the laboratory during cleaning whenever possible, but in
some instances preservative was left in place to keep the element intact, or when
removal techniques would have damaged the material. This was particularly true
for the fibs, radii, ulnae, and the bones of the os coxae.
No evidence of any disorder is visible that would have impacted the skeleton. Additionally, no evidence of enamel hypoplasia or any other indicator of
nutritional or non-specific stress is observed in Burial 1. Therefore, it is impossible to make any definitive statement about the overall health or nutritional
status of this infant.
The inventory of skeletal remains from Burial 1 was made using Bass
(1987) and Steele and Bramblett (1988) for skeletal identifications.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

We would like to thank a number of individuals for support during this
project. The landowner, Mrs. C. L. Nix, graciously allowed us to work on her
land while providing on-site encouragement. Mr. and Mrs. William Anderson
also extended some North Central Texas hospitality during the fieldwork while
providing access across their land to the site. Thanks are extended to Robert J.
Mallouf, State Archeologist, for his continued encouragement and numerous
suggestions concerning the project. Also quite helpful were Cathy Hoyt and
Hector Meza of the Office of the State Archeologist, who both provided suggestions and help with the generation of this article, and Teresa Howard, who ably
provided most of the drafting. We gratefully acknowledge Patti Landau and Gail
Colby of Texas A&M University for conducting the skeletal analysis in timely
fashion. We appreciate Billy Davidson’s expertise in conducting the faunal
analysis, and thank Dan ~1 for providing his knowledge of North Central
Texas archeology and helping with much of the fieldwork. Also, we thank all of
the participants in the fieldwork for their undying enthusiasm and hard work.
Sallie Taylor was especially helpful in the field with her artwork. We extend
special thanks to Lance Tfinque, who initiated this project and provided muchneeded manpower during its course. His yearning for knowledge challenged us

constantly and resulted in his learning a great deal about proper field techniques
and the preservation ethic. Lance can now truly be viewed as an ally of Texas
archeology.
