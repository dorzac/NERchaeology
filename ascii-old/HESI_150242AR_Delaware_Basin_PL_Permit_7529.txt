MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Between 21 and 28 January 2016, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the portions of Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation’s (Anadarko) proposed Delaware Basin Express pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that
are located on publicly owned tracts in Reeves and Loving counties, Texas (Project Area). The
construction of the proposed pipeline will be privately funded, will not require any federal
permitting, and will primarily be located on private property. However, 5 segments of the
proposed ROW traverse tracts of land owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO) and the
University of Texas (UT). As these entities are considered to be political subdivisions of the
state, the portions of the undertaking on these 5 properties are regulated by the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted
the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the
ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within
the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit number 7529.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures approximately 80.0 miles (128.7 kilometers
[km]) in length and will have a permanent ROW width of 50.0 feet (15.2 meters [m]; 484.8 acres
total). However, the Project Area (i.e., the 5 portions of the proposed ROW that cross GLO and
UT property) measures 8.7 miles (14.0 km) in length with a 100.0-foot- (30.5-m-) wide survey
corridor (approximately 105.5 acres).
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 142
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the
proposed Delaware Basin Express pipeline ROW across tracts GLO-1, GLO-2, GLO-3, and UT1 will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered
eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to
proceed with the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT on
these publicly owned tracts.

Management Summary

The GLO-4 tract contains deep alluvial soils within the northern quarter of the tract. If
the horizontal direction drill (HDD) bore location on this tract will be positioned within upland,
non-alluvial settings to the south of the river channel, then it is Horizon’s opinion that the
development of the Delaware Basin Express pipeline ROW across tract GLO-4 will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs, and that Anadarko should be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT on this publicly owned tract.
However, if the HDD bore location south of the Pecos River will be within the alluvial settings
adjacent to the river channel, then it is Horizon’s opinion that mechanical backhoe trenching
efforts are warranted within the HDD bore location prior to any ground disturbance in order to
determine if deeply buried cultural deposits are present.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the
portions of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation’s (Anadarko) proposed Delaware Basin Express
pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that are located on publicly owned tracts in Reeves and Loving
counties, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1-1 through 1-9). The construction of the proposed
pipeline will be privately funded, will not require any federal permitting, and will primarily be
located on private property. However, 5 segments of the proposed ROW traverse tracts of land
owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO) and the University of Texas (UT). As these
entities are considered to be political subdivisions of the state, the portions of the undertaking
on these 5 properties are regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of
Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted
the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the
ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within
the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs).
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures approximately 80.0 miles (128.7 kilometers
[km]) in length and will have a permanent ROW width of 50.0 feet (15.2 meters [m]; 484.8 acres
total). Along its length, the proposed ROW will extend across 4 tracts owned by the GLO and 1
tract owned by UT (see Figures 1-1 through 1-9). Across these 5 publicly owned tracts, the
Project Area measures approximately 8.7 miles (14.0 km) in length. Additionally, Horizon was
tasked with surveying a 100.0-foot- (30.5-m-) wide corridor within these tracts in order to allow
for extra work spaces during construction efforts as well as the avoidance of any critical
environmental features or cultural resources that might be documented along the length of
proposed ROW. With this in mind, the assessed Project Area totaled approximately 105.5
acres. The specifics of each of the 5 publicly owned tracts are provided below in Table 1-1.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s principal investigator,

Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area between 21 and 28 January 2016.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the surface of
the Project Area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS)
require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area totals 8.7 miles (14.0 km) in length, a minimum of 139
shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS (8.7
miles x 16 shovel tests). Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 142 shovel
tests across the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 142
excavated shovel tests.
While the majority of the Project Area on publicly owned land is situated within upland,
non-alluvial settings where shovel testing efforts are sufficient to assess the presence/absence
of cultural deposits, the northern quarter of the GLO-4 tract does contain deep alluvial soils
adjacent to the Pecos River, where mechanical backhoe trenching is typically required to
determine if deeply buried cultural deposits are present beyond the reach of shovel testing. At
this time, a horizontal direction drill (HDD) will be utilized to span the Pecos River. However, the
exact locations of the HDD bore entry/exit locations have yet to be determined. If the HDD bore
location on the south side of the Pecos River will be set in the upland areas roughly 3000.0 feet
(914.4 m) south of the river channel, then it is Horizon’s opinion that no additional investigations

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

are warranted in connection with the current undertaking. However, if the HDD bore location
south of the Pecos River will be within the alluvial settings less than 3000.0 feet (914.4 m) south
of the river channel, then it is Horizon’s opinion that mechanical backhoe trenching efforts are
warranted within the HDD bore location prior to any ground disturbance in order to determine if
deeply buried cultural deposits are present.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the
proposed Delaware Basin Express pipeline ROW across tracts GLO-1, GLO-2, GLO-3, and UT1 will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered
eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to
proceed with the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT on
these publicly owned tracts. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed pipeline ROW, even in previously surveyed areas,
all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC, GLO, and UT
should be notified of the discovery.
The GLO-4 tract contains deep alluvial soils within the northern quarter of the tract. If
the HDD bore location on this tract will be positioned within upland, non-alluvial settings to the
south of the river channel, then it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the Delaware
Basin Express pipeline ROW across tract GLO-4 will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs, and that
Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT on this publicly owned tract. However, if the HDD bore location south of
the Pecos River will be within the alluvial settings adjacent to the river channel, then it is
Horizon’s opinion that mechanical backhoe trenching efforts are warranted within the HDD bore
location prior to any ground disturbance in order to determine if deeply buried cultural deposits
are present.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

Anadarko’s proposed Delaware Basin Express pipeline ROW initiates at an existing
facility in northern Reeves County, approximately 9.3 miles (15.0 km) northwest of Orla, Texas.
From there, it extends southeasterly for approximately 80.0 miles (128.7 km) before terminating
at another existing facility located approximately 2.9 miles (4.7 km) northwest of Coyanosa,
Texas. The permanent ROW will measure 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide. However, Horizon was
tasked with surveying a 100.0-foot- (30.5-m-) wide corridor to allow for extra work spaces during
construction efforts as well as the avoidance of any critical environmental features or cultural
resources that may be documented along the length of proposed ROW. Along its length, the
proposed ROW will extend across 4 tracts owned by the GLO and 1 tract owned by UT Lands.
Across these 5 publicly owned tracts, the assessed ROW measures approximately 8.7 miles
(14.0 km) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with an overall area of 105.5 acres.
The 5 publicly owned tracts comprising the Project Area can be found on the US
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Screwbean Draw NE, Orla SE, Soda Lake NW, and
Ligon Ranch, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps (see Figures 1-2 through 1-5).
Representative images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resources survey are
presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-10.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The 5 tracts comprising the Project Area are located in desert settings in far West Texas.
Tracts GLO-1, 2, and 3 are all located in northwestern Reeves County, tract UT-1 is located in
southeastern Loving County, and tract GLO-4 is located in northeastern Reeves County. All are
situated within areas of gently undulating desert hills above the Pecos River or a variety of
unnamed drainages that are linked to the Pecos River.
Elevations within the GLO-1 tract are generally level at 2980.0 feet (908.3 m) above
mean sea level. This tract is drained to the north by overland sheet flow into China Draw.
China Draw flows northeasterly, emptying into Red Bluff Reservoir on the Pecos River,
approximately 3.8 miles (6.2 km) northeast of the Project Area (see Figure 1-2).

Elevations within the GLO-2 and GLO-3 tracts range between 2790.0 and 2860.0 feet
(850.4 and 871.7 m) above mean sea level. These tracts are drained to the northeast by
overland sheet flow into 2 unnamed drainages that join the Pecos River a short distance to the
northeast of these 2 tracts (see Figure 1-3).
The UT-1 tract is located east of the Pecos River within an area of rolling desert hills.
Elevations within this tract range between 2720.0 and 2840.0 feet (835.2 and 865.6 m) above
mean sea level. It is drained to the south by numerous unnamed drainages that flow toward
Soda Lake and the Pecos River, several miles to the south and southwest (see Figure 1-4).
Finally, the GLO-4 tract is located due south of the Pecos River within an area of rolling
desert hills on the high bank side of the river channel. Elevations within this tract range
between 2500.0 and 2600.0 feet (762.0 and 792.5 m) above mean sea level. It drains directly
into the Pecos River to the north (see Figure 1-5).

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Loving and Reeves counties are generally cool, with average temperatures of
45.0 and 46.0 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), respectively. The summer months are hot, with average
temperatures of 82.0 and 83.0°F, respectively. The average annual total precipitation in Loving
County is about 12.4 inches (31.5 centimeters [cm]), with roughly 84% of it falling between April
and September, while the average annual total precipitation in Reeves County is about 8.6
inches (21.8 cm), with roughly 70% of it falling between April and September (NRCS 2016a and
2016b).

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all of
Trans-Pecos Texas except the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950). Blair noted that portions of
Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now drained by the
Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the Chihuahuan Deserts
ecoregion, the Project Area is situated within geologic formations composed of sand sheet and
caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant communities dominate the Chihuahuan
Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland.
The dominant species associated with the saline flats and alkaline playa margins plant
community include Atriplex canescens (fourwing saltbush), Suaeda spp. (seepweed), Salicornia
spp. (pickleweed), and Sporobolus airoides (alkali sacaton). The dominant species associated
with the gypsum land plant community include Bouteloua breviseta (gypsum grama), Mentzelia
spp. (blazingstar), and Ephedra torreyana (Torrey’s jointfir). The dominant species associated
with the desert shrubland plant community include Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), Flourensia
cernua (American tarwort), Yucca spp. (yucca), Artemisia filifolia (sand sagebrush), Acacia
rigidula (blackbrush), Cylindropuntia leptocaulis (Christmas cactus), Agave lechuguilla
(lechuguilla), and Leucophyllum frutescens (cenizo) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: the Paleoindian (pre-8500
B.P.), the Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and the Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic
period is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6000
B.P. to 3500 B.P.), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 B.P.)

The Paleoindian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early Paleoindian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 B.P.)

Like the Paleoindian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locales and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.

HJN 150252 AR

27

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries, as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC I (1250 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is highly evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the
recovery of burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices
also suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of only 1 previously recorded archeological site
within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of any of the 5 publicly owed tracts, while a review of the
National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map
layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review
perimeters. This previously recorded archeological site and its distance from the closest
publicly owned tracts are presented in Table 4-1 and Figure 4-1. No documented cultural
resources, including any listed on the NRHP or formally designated as SALs, are located within
or immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW. Based on the Atlas database, the portions of
the proposed ROW across the GLO and UT Lands tracts have not been previously assessed for
cultural resources.

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are
often found in proximity to playa lake beds and dune blowouts. Based on the variety of settings
within the Project Area, in conjunction with its overall length, it was Horizon’s opinion, prior to
the field efforts, that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric
cultural deposits at select locations within the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to
the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle maps suggested a decreased potential
for historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the Project Area between 21 and 28 January 2016. This entailed intensive surface inspection
and subsurface shovel testing across the surface of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
wide. As the Project Area totals 8.7 miles (14.0 km) in length, a minimum of 139 shovel tests
were necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS (8.7 miles x 16
shovel tests). Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 142 shovel tests across
the Project Area.
All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter
[mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful
screening. The specific number of shovel tests per tract is listed in Table 5-1.

Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site forms were
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated
site forms were completed and filed at the TARL.

Chapter 5.0: Survey Methodology

A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD
83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figures 5-1 through 5-4. Shovel test data are
presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

Between 21 and 28 January 2016, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey of the portions of Anadarko’s proposed Delaware Basin Express pipeline ROW that are
located on publicly owned tracts in Reeves and Loving counties, Texas. The construction of the
proposed pipeline will be privately funded, will not require any federal permitting, and will
primarily be located on private property. However, 5 segments of the proposed ROW traverse
tracts of land owned by the GLO and the UT. As these entities are considered to be political
subdivisions of the state, the portions of the undertaking on these 5 properties are regulated by
the ACT. At the request of Whitenton, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the
Project Area on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was
to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed,
to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as SALs. The cultural resources survey was conducted under
TAC permit number 7529.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures approximately 80.0 miles (128.7 km) in
length and will have a permanent ROW width of 50.0 feet (15.2 m; 484.8 acres total). Along its
length, the proposed ROW will extend across 4 tracts owned by the GLO and 1 tract owned by
UT. Across these 5 publicly owned tracts, the Project Area measures approximately 8.7 miles
(14.0 km) in length. Additionally, Horizon was tasked with surveying a 100.0-foot- (30.5-m-)
wide corridor within these tracts in order to allow for extra work spaces during construction
efforts as well as the avoidance of any critical environmental features or cultural resources that
might be documented along the length of proposed ROW. With this in mind, the assessed
Project Area totaled approximately 105.5 acres.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area between 21 and 28 January 2016.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the surface of
the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area totals 8.7 miles (14.0 km) in
length, a minimum of 139 shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area in order to
comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 142 shovel
tests across the Project Area.

HJN 150252 AR

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 142
excavated shovel tests.
While the majority of the Project Area on publicly owned land is situated within upland,
non-alluvial settings where shovel testing efforts are sufficient to assess the presence/absence
of cultural deposits, the northern quarter of the GLO-4 tract does contain deep alluvial soils
adjacent to the Pecos River, where mechanical backhoe trenching is typically required to
determine if deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of shovel testing are present. At
this time, a HDD will be utilized to span the Pecos River. However, the exact locations of the
HDD bore entry/exit locations have yet to be determined. If the HDD bore location on the south
side of the Pecos River will be set in the upland areas roughly 3000.0 feet (914.4 m) south of
the river channel, then it is Horizon’s opinion that no additional investigations are warranted in
connection with the current undertaking. However, if the HDD bore location south of the Pecos
River will be within the alluvial settings less than 3000.0 feet (914.4 m) south of the river
channel, then it is Horizon’s opinion that mechanical backhoe trenching efforts are warranted
within the HDD bore location prior to any ground disturbance in order to determine if deeply
buried cultural deposits are present.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the
proposed Delaware Basin Express pipeline ROW across tracts GLO-1, GLO-2, GLO-3, and UT1 will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered
eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to
proceed with the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT on
these publicly owned tracts. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed pipeline ROW, even in previously surveyed areas,
all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC, GLO, and UT
should be notified of the discovery.
The GLO-4 tract contains deep alluvial soils within the northern quarter of the tract. If
the HDD bore location on this tract will be positioned within upland, non-alluvial settings to the
south of the river channel, then it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the Delaware
Basin Express pipeline ROW across tract GLO-4 will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs, and that
Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT on this publicly owned tract. However, if the HDD bore location south of
the Pecos River will be within the alluvial settings adjacent to the river channel, then it is
Horizon’s opinion that mechanical backhoe trenching efforts are warranted within the HDD bore
location prior to any ground disturbance in order to determine if deeply buried cultural deposits
are present.
