ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of four miles of natural gas pipeline in central
Goliad County, Texas was conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) in March of 2006 for Duke Energy Field Services. In all 7.3 acres were
examined. No previously recorded archaeological sites have been recorded within
any portion of the project area, and no new sites were found. No artifacts were
collected.

INTRODUCTION
Duke Energy Field Services proposes to transport natural gas across
portions of rural Goliad County, Texas in an eight-inch diameter pipe. The total
length of the gas pipeline is 10 miles, and it is west of Goliad (Figure 1). Only
approximately four miles, however, consists of new line and was examined for
archaeological sites. The pipe will be placed in a trench about 24 inches wide and
will be beneath four feet of cover. The project area is depicted on two USGS 7.5’
topographic quadrangles, Charco (2897-314) and Goliad (2897-423) (Figure 2).
Funds for this project will come from Duke Energy Field Services.
Therefore, consultation with the Texas Historical Commission was not necessary.
The client requested an archaeological survey in order to avoid affecting
significant cultural resources that may be present. A review of past work in the
area by professional archaeologists revealed a portion of the route of the
proposed pipeline traversed an upland ridge overlooking Cabeza Creek, a major
stream in the county. The TARL search indicated seven archaeological sites had
been recorded along this drainage in the vicinity of the current project area. In
addition, Spanish Colonial artifacts have been found in Goliad County sites.
Therefore, BVRA viewed portions of the pipeline route to be high probability
areas for significant sites.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following information was taken from The Handbook of Texas Online
(2001). Goliad County is located on the Texas coast 25 miles inland from
Copano Bay in Southeast Texas. It is bounded by Bee, DeWitt, Karnes, Refugio,
and Victoria counties. The county is 859 square miles in size, and most of the
terrain is the nearly level to gently rolling Rio Grande Plain.
Much of Goliad County lies within the post oak savannah belt and contains
mixed forests that include blackjack, post oak, live oak intermixed with huisache,
red cedar, cacti, and various forms of brush and other vegetation. Along the river
stands of pecan and elm are present. The elevation of Goliad County reaches
250 feet in places, and the climate is humid-subtropical. The average growing
season lasts 285 days and extends from late February to early December. The
average annual precipitation is 33.79 inches. Typical mammals in the county
include bobcats, opossums, squirrels, foxes, armadillos, skunks, bats, rabbits,
Plains pocket gophers, and mice. There are habitats that support numerous
species of reptiles, fish, and birds.
At the time of this survey, there was no published soil survey for Goliad
County. According to the General Soil Survey for Goliad County, there are three
soil associations present in the project area. These are the Weesatche-PettusOlmos association (3), the Runge-Sarnosa association (5), and the AransasSinton association (7).
The Weesatche-Pettus-Olmos association consists of gently sloping to
strongly sloping, deep to very shallow, neutral to moderately alkaline, loamy soils
of the uplands, the Runge-Sarnosa association consists of gently sloping to
deep, neutral to moderately alkaline, loamy soils of the uplands, and the
Aransas-Sinton association consists of nearly level, deep, moderately alkaline,
clayey and loamy soils of the bottomlands.
At the time of this survey the vegetation in the uplands east of Cabeza
Creek (Area A) consisted mainly of huisache, mesquite, mixed brush, and
scattered live oaks (Figure 3). In the area west of Cabeza Creek (Area B), the
vegetation consisted mainly of pasture dominated by Bermuda grass, Klein
grass, and various native grasses (Figure 4). In the floodplain, pasture was
present (Figure 5) but stands of huisache, mesquite, and hackberry were present
adjacent to an old oxbow near the creek (Figure 6).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a statistical overview published by the THC (Biesaart et al.
1985:76), Goliad County is located in the Central Coastal Plain CulturalGeographical Region of Texas. In 1985, when the overview was published, the
number of archaeological sites in the region was 1067 or 5.28% of the state. In
1985, there were 37 recorded sites in the county. * This accounted for 3.47% of
the region and .18% of the state. Although three Paleo-Indian sites were
reported, the majority of sites in 1985 were listed as Archaic (n=6) and Late
Prehistoric (n=5). No age is given for the remaining 23 sites.
Site disturbance is common in the area. Biesaart et al. (1985:139)
mention 30 sites affected by erosion disturbance and 2 sites affected by
construction disturbance. One site is described as dispersed, 1 site is described
as destroyed, and 2 sites are described as pristine. Two sites have been
excavated, 18 sites have been tested by hand, and 37 sites have been surface
collected. Sites with hearths (n=1) and midden soil (n=1) were known to exist in
1985, and one site containing a burial was documented. In 1996, there were four
sites with burials (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996).
According to a planning document for the Central and Southern Planning
Region of Texas as defined by the Texas Historical Commission (MercadoAllinger et al. 1996:13), Goliad County is located in the Southern Coastal
Corridor Archeological Region. This is one of the major oil and gas producing
areas in the state.
The major drainages in the county are the San Antonio River and Coleto
Creek, and most of the sites are found along these streams. Significant
prehistoric sites are present in the county. The main cluster of important sites is
located along Coleto Creek. Each one of these sites (41GD13-21; 41GD3041GD31, 41GD33-41GD35; 41GD39-41GD42, and 41GD46) has received the
designation of a State Archeological Landmark. Evidence of Paleoindian activity
in the county was found at one of these sites. The Berger Bluff site (41GD30)
produced “a wealth of early Paleoindian environmental and radiocarbon data but
did not yield artifacts in association with the dated early deposits” (Brown 1986).
According to Mercado-Allinger et al. (1996:63), the importance of this site is its
deep subsurface context which points to the importance of understanding the
geomorphic history of the region in order to be able to locate deposits of
sufficiently early age to further study the Paleoindian period. Work at Coleto
Creek has been conducted by The University of Texas at San Antonio (Fox and
Hester 1976; Fox 1979; Brown 1986) and Burns and McDonnel, Inc. (2003).

Significant Historic sites dating to the Spanish Colonial period include
Mission Espiritu (41GD1), Mission Rosario (41GD2), the Presidio la Bahia
(41GD7), and La Villa de la Bahia (41GD112). Sites 41GD1, 41GD2, and
41GD7 are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, while site 41GD112
has been designated as a State Archeological Landmark. The most recent largescale survey in Goliad County was conducted by Archaeology Consultants, Inc.
of George West, Texas (Moore et al. 2005). This project examined an area
around the presidio and adjacent cemetery. One new prehistoric site (41GD122)
was recorded, and the cemetery was assigned the trinomial 41GD123.
Cabeza Creek and two unnamed tributaries of the San Antonio River
cross the route of the pipeline as currently proposed. Several sites have been
recorded on these drainages. On Cabeza Creek, Archeological Steward Smity
Schmiedlin recorded six prehistoric sites south of the pipeline. These sites
consist of two prehistoric camps (41GD87 and 41GD88), a lithic quarry
(41GD89), a lithic scatter (41GD109), a creek crossing where lithic artifacts were
found (41GD108), and an unknown prehistoric site on the high bank overlooking
Cabeza Creek (41GD111). Schmiedlin recorded one historic site consisting of
ceramics and other artifacts along a cow trail (41GD110) next to Cabeza Creek.
James E. Warren recorded three historic farmsteads (41GD69, 41GD72, and
41GD73) on or near the unnamed tributaries of the San Antonio River.
Additional small area surveys have been conducted in Goliad County. For
more information regarding other work in the area researchers are advised to
consult the site files at TARL and the THC. For additional information regarding
the prehistory and history of Goliad County, the interested reader is referred to
those reports cited above as well as those discussed below.
Gail L. Bailey (1987) compiled a bibliography of the Southern Coastal
Corridor Region of Texas, which includes Goliad County. There is a published
series entitled Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology (published by the THC
and compiled by William E. Moore) that documents all work in Texas from 1988
through 1992. Other sources include Digging Into South Texas Prehistory: A
Guide for Amateur Archaeologists (Hester 1980b), Texas Graveyards: A Cultural
Legacy (Jordan 1988), and Traces of Texas History: Archeological Evidence of
the Past 450 Years (Fox 1983).

* This number does not agree with data presented in the planning document by
Mercado-Allinger et al. (1996). According to Table 2.1.3 of this document there
were 47 sites recorded prior to 1980.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Prior to the field survey, the Principal Investigator conducted a review of
previous work in the general area and talked with other archaeologists. The
Texas Historic Sites Atlas was checked for previously recorded sites and areas
surveyed, and a records check at TARL was performed.
Initially, the entire route of the pipeline was to be examined through a
100% Pedestrian Survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenches as needed.
The vegetation was too thick in places to allow for the survey crew to walk the
pipeline completely. Therefore, three high probability areas were identified
based on the topographic maps. These areas are an upland ridge east of
Cabeza Creek (Area A), an upland area between two unnamed tributaries of the
San Antonio River (Area B), and the floodplain west of Cabeza Creek (Area C).
The field crew visited Area B first and dug shovel tests 1-5 (Figure 2).
Since clay was encountered near the surface, additional tests were not
excavated. The use of a backhoe in an upland setting was not considered
necessary. Next, the crew walked the floodplain (Area C) and dug one shovel
probe and found clay to be at or near the surface. Therefore, no additional
shovel tests were excavated. Use of a backhoe near the creek was considered;
however, landowner permission could not be obtained in time to perform this task
prior to construction of the pipeline.
Finally, the crew visited the high points along the upland ridge east of
Cabeza Creek (Area A). Shovel testing revealed clay and/or caliche at or near
the surface. When the ground surface was visible, the area was visually
inspected for cultural materials. It was determined that no buried sites are likely
to be present on this ridge or on the slopes. Seven shovel tests (6-12) were
excavated in Area A (Figure 2). Excavated earth from each shovel test was
screened using quarter-inch hardware cloth, and a shovel test log was
maintained (Appendix I). All shovel tests were terminated when clay or caliche
subsoil was encountered.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A search of the site records at TARL revealed no previously recorded sites
in the Area of Potential Affect (APE). Several professional and amateur surveys
have been conducted in the area, and some of these recorded sites (see
Archaeological Background above).
At the time of this survey much of the project area was covered with dense
vegetation making a 100% Pedestrian Survey impossible. Three areas were
investigated (see Methods of Investigation above). Prior to the survey, one of the
upland areas overlooking Cabeza Creek (Area A) was considered to be a very
high probability area for a prehistoric site. However, the lack of sandy soils
appears to be the reason for the absence of a site in this area. No rocks large
enough to be used for stone tool manufacture were observed. It is, therefore, not
likely that a significant lithic scatter is present in the thick brush where the surface
was not visible. A small rise to the west of the creek that lies between two
tributaries of the San Antonio River (Area B) was considered to be a medium
probability area for a prehistoric site. However, the lack of sandy soils appears to
be the reason for the absence of a site in this area. Area C is the flat area
between one of the tributaries of the San Antonio River and Cabeza Creek. It
was considered to be a low to medium probability area for a prehistoric site. The
lack of sandy soils appears to be the reason for the absence of a site in this area.
Cabeza Creek is deeply entrenched into the landscape and contained water at
the time of this survey. Since buried sites have been found in similar settings in
Goliad County, portions of this area were considered to be a medium to high
probability area for a prehistoric site.
BVRA was aware of the possibility of the presence of Spanish Colonial
sites and/or later historic sites anywhere within the project area. No evidence of
historic utilization of the project area was observed. It is possible that parts of the
project area may have once been part of larger farms or ranches, but no
evidence of this was noted

RECOMMENDATIONS
No prehistoric or historic archaeological sites were found to be within the
APE. It is, therefore, recommended that Duke Energy be allowed to proceed
with construction as planned throughout the project area. If any prehistoric or
historic sites within the APE are encountered during construction, all work should
cease until the site or sites can be evaluated. Should construction plans change
to include new areas that will affect undisturbed ground, a return visit by a
professional archaeologist may be necessary.
