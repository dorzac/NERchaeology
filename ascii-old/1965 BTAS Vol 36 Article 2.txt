The Granite Beach Site, Llano County, T exas
DAYMOND D. CRAWFORD
ABSTRACT
Between the summer of 1952 and the winter of 1964, when the level of Lake
Buchanan was far below normal, a number of archeological sites were exposed.
One of these, the Granite Bea ch Site, proved to be of special interest, as it yielded
a number of dart points which suggest occupation during Paleo-Indian and early
Archaic times. This locality and m ateria ls collected or observed on the surface are
briefly described.

INTRODUCTION

At normal pool level, approximately 1020 feet above sea level, Lake
Buchanan in Burnet and Llano counties, Texas, covers an area roughly
32 miles long and a maximum of eight miles wide. However, in the
summer of 1962 through the winter of 1964, the level of the lake was
reduced to as low as 986 feet above sea level, temporarily exposing
many acres of land. In the early part of June, 1962, the writer made
an archeological survey of portions of the exposed area at the southern
end of Lake Buchanan. Several previously unrecorded Indian sites
(Jackson and Woolsey, 1938 ) were located, but only one, the Granite
Beach Site ( 41 LL 2) appeared to be of special interest. Here artifacts
were fairly numerous and, even more importantly, many of the more
diagnostic specimens-the dart points-seemed to be affiliated with
the Paleo-Indian Stage (Suhm, et al., 1954: 16-18 ). Because of the
obvious importance of the site, it was frequently visited by the writer
and surface collections were made from the summer of 1962 to the
winter of 1964, when portions of the area of occupation were last
exposed.
The following report briefly describes the Granite Beach Site, the
extent of the investigations, the occupational features recorded, and
the specimens collected from the surface. In carrying out this study,
the author is indebted to Lathel F. Duffield, formerly with the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project, The University of Texas, and Curtis D.
Tunnell, Curator of Anthropology, the Texas Memorial Museum.
Both of these persons gave freely of their time and information, and
without their assistance this report would have been impossible to
complete.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE

The Granite Beach Site, usually inundated by the waters of Lake
Buchanan, lies on the westem shore of the lake, about half of a mile
southwest of the former Colorado River channel. At its maximum
exposure, when the lake level was at an elevation of approximately
986 feet, the site extended over about 180 by 120 feet of a gentle slope,
now a beach formed by wave action (Fig. 1) . To judge from tree
stumps in the immediate vicinity, erosion has removed six to 12 inches
of topsoil, uncovering artifacts and other evidence of occupation.
Hearth and several unusual concentrations of stones have been exposed, while many, if not all, of the artifacts seem to have been let
down onto the surface. Indications are that, before the lake was
created, the site was covered with post oak and juniper. A small,
spring-fed stream which once ran just to the northeast of the site
probably served as a source of water for the inhabitants.
As there was no apparent depth to the occupation, all artifacts and
features are from the surface. The artifacts, as well as the occupational
features, were found on the surface and by wading along the shallow
shores of the lake. Approximately 70 percent of the specimens collected are from the exposed part of the site; the remainder are from
the then-existing margins of the lake.
OCCUPATIONAL FEATURES
HEARTHS

The Granite Beach Site contained the remains of at least 51 hearths
(Fig. 1), all of which seemed to be of the same general type. They
consisted of roughly circular to oblong concentrations of hearthstone,
and averaged about 48 inches in diameter (Fig. 2, A). One, however,
was 72 inches by 48 inches, while another measured only 14 by 18
inches (consult Table 1 for other dimensions). None of the hearths
was excavated, so the thickness and the method of construction remain
undetermined. They were simply recorded as surface features, having
been exposed to various degrees by wave action.
Locally-obtained, pink granite rocks were used as hearthstones,
with the individual stones varying in size from small fragments only
two to three inches in maximum dimensions, to fairly large pieces that
were six to eight inches across and from four to five inches thick. Many
of the hearthstones had been cracked by exposure to heat, and the soil
in and about the hearths was typically light gray in color, possibly
stained by ash and charcoal (no actual flecks of charcoal, however,

were noted ). This matrix contained a few flint chips but no mussel
shells or animal bones.
While the lack of detailed information prohibits close comparison,
it is possible that the Granite Beach hearths are structurally similar
to those recorded at a nearby Lake Buchanan site, B-3, found by the
author and briefly described by Tunnell and Newcomb ( 1962). The
artifacts collected from B-3 are quite different from those found at the
Granite Beach Site and would seem to indicate that B-3 dates primarily
from the late Archaic period. This raises the important, but unanswerable, question as to the exact cultural affiliations of the Granite
Beach hearths.
BuRNED STONE CoNCENTRATION

In the southern part of the site a large, somewhat crescent-shaped
concentration of burned granite rocks was observed (Fig. 1). This

76

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

feature seemed clearly to have been man-made and it is differentiated
from the hearths chiefly because of its larger size. It was generally
about 36 inches wide and a maximum of roughly 10 feet long. The
soil within and around the concentration was gray in color, and contained a few flint chips but no food refuse. The thickness of this concentration was not determined.
STONE PILES

Also found at the site were two roughly circular accumulations of
granite rocks (Figs. 1 and 2, B). Each of these was approximately 72
inches across and extended about 30 inches above the ground surface.
Stones comprising the piles were a maximum of 10 to 15 inches across
and six to eight inches in thickness. Neither the stones nor the soil
about them showed evidence of fire. These features were not systematically excavated and their purpose is problematical-they may
postdate the Indian occuption, or they have served as stock piles for
hearthstones.
DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIMENS

Eighty-one artifacts, all of stone, were collected from the Granite
Beach Site by the author. Included are 73 recognizable dart points
and dart point fragments, four apparently rechipped dart points, two
scrapers, a grooved piece of sandstone, and a grinding slab. In the
section which follows all of the specimens are described, although only
the dart points have been sorted into a number of finer groups. Each
of these has been given a numerical designation (labeled I-XI),
even though many of them compare rather favorably with established
typologies. It is felt that this approach conveniently and accurately
describes the dart points, as well as calls attention to the difficulties
encountered in attempting to use existing types.
DART POINTS

Group I (Figs. 3, A-L' and 4, A-B' )
No. of specimens: 14 (8 complete and 6 nearly complete ) .
Outline form: Each of these specimens can be described as a generally
short, broad point with a triangular blade, a roughly rectangular
stem, and a deeply-indented base. The blade has straight to slightly
convex or concave lateral edges and weak (Fig. 3, H-I') to pronounced, but only rarely barbed (Fig. 3, G), shoulders. Lateral edges

of the blade are typically beveled, seven to the right and five to the
left. The bases on all specimens have a deep, roughly U-shaped
concavity, while the lateral edges of the stem vary from parallel
to slightly expanding. On at least four specimens there is some sug-

78

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

gestion of very light smoothing along the edges of the stem. The
corners of the stem vary from rounded (such as Fig. 3, I ) to sharply
pointed (such as Fig. 4, B) and are frequently asymmetrical (Fig.
3, D-L' ) .

Dimensions: Total length, 3 to 5 em.; stem length, 1.6 to 1.9 em.; width
across shoulders, 1.8 to 3 em.; width across base, 1.4 to 2 .4 em.;
maximum thickness, .5 to .8 em.; maximum depth of basal concavity, .4to 1.1 em.
Weight: 2.8 to 10.4 grams.
Material: Group I points have been fashioned from fine-grained flint
or, more commonly, chert with an occasional impurity; colors
range from cream through brown to blue-gray.
Workmanship: The chipping is generally rather crudely done, though
long, oblique flake scars often appear across the blade. Marginal
retouching is poor and served mainly to produce the beveled blade
edges. Remnants of large, crescent-shaped flake scars consistently
appear along the basal concavity (especially clear in Fig. 3, I, I' ) .
Remarks: These points are very similar to the tentative new Gower
type as well as some of the Gower variants (Shafer, 1963 : 64-65,
Fig. 7, A-E); Group I specimens differ from Gower only in that they
are slightly larger and usually have more prominent shoulders. In
addition, one of the points (Fig. 3, A, A' ) is much like a small,
stemmed point found in the deepest occupation zone at the Devil's
Mouth Site (Johnson, 1964: 55, Fig. 17, J ) . In outline form, Group
I points also resemble the Pedernales type ( Suhm and Jelks, 1962:
235, Pls. 118 and 119 ) but are cruder, tend to be smaller, and more
often have beveled blades.
One of the points (Fig. 3, I , I') has a possible burin along the
proximal portion of a lateral edge; it extends from the corner of the
base to 2..4 em. toward the distal end.
Group II (Fig. 4, C-D' )
No . of specimens: 2 (both complete).
Outline form: These are rather slender points with expanding stems
and concave bases. The blade is long and triangular and has straight
to slightly convex lateral edges which are alternately beveled (to
the right) on one specimen (Fig. 4, C, C' ). Shoulders are present,
but they are not prominent. The lateral edges of the stem are from

slightly (Fig. 4, C, C' ) to markedly (Fig. 4, D, D' ) flaring while
the basal concavity is broad and fairly deep. On both specimens the
lateral edges of the stem are faintly smoothed.

Dimensions: Total length, 4.3 and 5.1 em.; stem length, 1.2 and 1.3
em.; width across the shoulders, both 2 em. ; width across the base,
2 and 2.1 em.; maximum depth of basal concavity, both .3 em. ;
maximum thickness, .5 and .6 em. , respectively.
Weight: 5.4 and 5.8 grams.
Materials: Both specimens are made from locally-occurring cream to
grayish chert.
l'Vorkmanship: In general these points are fairly well made, although
the flake scars are typically short and narrow. Marginal retouching
occurs on only one specimen (Fig. 4, C, C' ) .

Remarks: Of the recognized point types, these specimens are most
similar to Uvalde (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 255, Pl. 128) .
Group III (Fig. 4, E-G')
No . of specimens: 3 (2 complete, 1 fragmentary).
Outline form: Each of these long, slender points has weak shoulders
and a faintly contracting stem. The edges of the blade are slightly
(Fig. 4, G, G' ) to markedly convex and tend to merge gently with
the edges of the stem. The treatment of the base is variable, ranging
from straight (Fig. 4, E, E') , to convex (Fig. 4, F , F' ), to mildly
concave (Fig. 4, G, G' ) . The edges of the stem and the base are
lightly smoothed.
Dimensions: Total length (complete specimens only), 7 and 9.3 em. ;
stem length, 1. 4 to 1. 7 em.; width across the shoulders, 2.2 to 2.6
em.; width across the base, 1.2 to 1.4 em.; maximum thickness, .6
to .8 em.; depth of basal concavity (one specimen only), .1 em.
Weight: 12.2 and 22.3 grams.
Material: All are apparently fashioned from locally-obtained cherts
and/ or very fine-grained quartzite varying in color from cream to
brown and brownish-gray.
Workmanship: On the whole the chipping is good, with regular,
obliquely-parallel flake scars appearing across two specimens. On
the third point (Fig. 4, F, F' ) the flake scars tend to be broader and

THE GRANITE BEACH SITE

81

somewhat more irregular. All edges have been marginally retouched.

Remarks: Two (Fig. 4, E, E' and G, G' ) of the Group II points fall
within the range of the Travis type (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 251,
Pl. 126). The concave base of the third (Fig. 4, F , F' ), however,
excludes it from that type.
Group IV (Fig. 4, H-I')
No . of specimens: 2 (both complete)
Outline form: Each of these specimens has a long, slender blade and
very poorly differentiated, but roughly rectangular, stem. On one
point (Fig. 4, H, H') the shoulders are very weak, while on the
other (Fig. 4, I, I') no shoulders can be distinguished. The lateral
edges of the blades on both points are gently convex, and in one
case (Fig. 4, I, I') serrated. The edges of the stem on one (Fig. 4,
I, I') are smoothed, while both bases are straight.
Dimensions: Total length, 7.5 and 5.7 em,; stem length, 2 em. and
approximately 2.4 em.; width across the shoulders, 2.4 and 2 em.;
width across the base of the stem, 1.8 and 1.7 em.; maximum thickness , 1.2 and .8 em.
Weight: 22.1 and 11.9 grams.
MateriaL Both of the Group IV have been chipped from cream-colored
chert.
Workmanship: One (Fig. 4, H, H' ) is quite crudely flaked, while the
other is fairly well made and exhibits some marginal retouching.
Both have a markedly plano-convex cross section.
Remarks: Neither of the Group IV points fits an established type, although their outline forms are generally reminiscent of Travis
points. The stems, however, are too poorly differentiated from the
blades to permit inclusion in that type.
Group V (Fig. 4, J, J' )
No. of specimens: 1 (complete ) .
Outline form: This unusual point has a broad, triangular blade with
convex lateral edges and pronounced, but barbless, shoulders. The
short, broad stem has noticeably rounded corners and a convex base.

82

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Dimensions: Total length, 4.4 em.; stem length, 1.1 em.; width across
the shoulders, 3.4 em.; width across the base of the stem, 2.2 em.;
maximum thickness, .5 em.
Weight: 8.6 grams.
Material: A good quality, grayish chert or flint was used in the manufacture of this specimen.
Workmanship: The flaking is quite skillfully done and several broad,
shallow scars appear across both surfaces. Marginal edges show
alternate retouching which gives the impression of narrow beveling.
Remarks: The roundness of the stem is suggestive of Morhiss points;
however, this specimen is much too short, to be included in that type.
Group VI (Fig. 5, A-C' )
No. of specimens: 3 (1 complete, 1 essentially complete, 1 fragmentary ) .
Outline form: Each has a lanceolate outline with a markedly contracting proximal end. On two specimens (Fig. 5, A, B) the proximal
end is almost pointed, while on the third (Fig. 5, C) it is more
gently contracting. The base is very faintly concave on each point,
and both lateral edges are mildly convex for the entire length of the
point. The two complete examples have serrated blades, and all
three have very slightly concave bases.
Dimensions (the complete and essentially complete specimens only) :
Total length, 12.7 em. and an estimated 11.5 em.; maximum width,
2.7 and 3.1 em.; maximum thickness, .7 and 1 em. respectively.
Weight: (complete specimen only) 26.6 grams.
Material: Two are of a grayish-brown chert, while the third (Fig. 5,
C) is made from a very fine-grained quartzite.
Workmanship: Skillfully chipped, horizontal to slightly oblique flake
scars appear across both surfaces, and all marginal edges are neatly
retouched.
Remarks: The two examples with markedly contracting, proximal
ends are reminiscent of the Lerma type (MacNeish, 1958: 62, Fig.
23, 22--27; Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 207, Pl. 104), but are better made
than the typical Lerma. All three are similar to Agate Basin points

(Wormington, 1957: 141 and 269, Fig. 7), in both workmanship
and outline form.
One of the Group VI points (Fig. 5, B, B' ) has a possible burin

84

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

facet along one lateral edge. It extends from the tip toward the
proximal end for a distance of 5.3 em. There are no indications of
resharpening, although the distal edge is perhaps smoothed from use.

Group VII (Figs. 5, D -I , and 6, A-E' )
No. of specimens: 11 ( 7 complete, 1 nearly complete, and 3 basal fragments ) .
Outline form: Each of these points has a somewhat lanceolate outline.
The upper half the blade on the complete specimens, however, tends
to be triangular in outline, while the lower half is generally contracting. The lateral edges vary from straight to slightly convex or
concave. On one (Fig. 6, B, B') the corners are slightly flaring, on
the others they are essentially straight and are either sharply
pointed or rounded. Of the eight examples with the distal portion
of the blade intact, seven are alternately beveled, six to the right,
one to the left. The bevel typically begins at the midsection-the
widest point-and continues to the tip. The base is gently concave
on each specimen, although on some (Fig. 5, F, G), the concavity is
quite shallow. All proximal edges, including the concavity, are
smoothed, often very heavily so.
Dimensions: Total length, 4.5 to 7 em.; maximum width, 2 to 2.3 em. ;
maximum thickness, .7 to 1 em.; maximum depth of basal concavity, less than .1 to .2 em.
Weight: 7.1 to 16.7 grams.
Material: These points are made from cream to brownish-gray, very
fine-grained chert or flint.
Workmanship: As a group these points are well made and frequently
exhibit long parallel, usually oblique, flake scars across the blade
surface. The only exception (Fig. 5, E, E' ) has numerous, irregular
scars which have created marked relief. Marginal edges are consistently retouched and occasionally appear to be lightly serrated.
The distal ends of two (Fig. 6, A, B) are somewhat blunted, onepossibly both-from rechipping.
Remarks: With the possible exception of the point that has slightly
flaring basal corners, the outline form of these specimens falls within the range of the Angostura type. The high incidence of beveling,
however, is not generally regarded as being typical of Angostura
(SuhmandJelks, 1962: 167, Pl. 84) .
The bases of two of these points have burin facets, both of the

lateral-to-medial type (Epstein, 1963 : 189-191, Fig. 2 ) . One (Fig. 6,
C, C' ) occurs as a double burin, one at each corner, with each burin
facet measuring .4 em. in length. T he other point (Fig. 5, F, F' ) has

86

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

a single burin facet which measures .5 em. in length. In terms of
smoothness and presence of minute flake scars, each of these burin
facets shows extensive signs of use .

Group VIII (Fig. 6, F-L' )
No . of specimens: 7 (1 complete, 1 nearly complete, and 5 basal fragments ).
Outline form: The most distinctive features of these points are their
slightly concave proximal edges and usually pronounced basal concavity. All but one are rather wide. Three of the four examples (Fig.
6, J-L ) having all or portions of the blade intact have lateral edges
alternately beveled to the right. The others may also have been
beveled, but they are too incomplete to be certain of either the
presence or absence of this feature. The comers of the base tend to
flare, sometimes rather markedly. Basal and lateral smoothing occurs
on all examples.
Dimensions: Total length (complete specimen only ), 4.8 em.; maximum width (across the base ) , 1.9 to 3 em.; maximum thickness,
between .6 and .65 em.; maximum depth of basal concavity, .3 to
.8 em.
Weight: (complete example only; it has, however, been badly thermal
fractured ) 5.5 grams.
Material: These points were apparently made from locally-obtained
chert and flint.
Workmanship: Generally, the chipping is well done with regular f1ake
scars predominating. Lateral edges are retouched and the base is
thinned either by the removal of several long, narrow flakes, or
more often, rather large, crescent-shaped flakes.
Remarks: In outline form these points resemble the golondrina variety
of Plainview (Johnson, 1964: 46-52, Fig. 15, A-J ). However, Group
VIII specimens are typically better made and, at least some, are
beveled. Both the beveling and outline form, on the other hand, are
similar to the Meserve type (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 218, Pl. 109 ).
Two of the Group VIII points (Fig. 6, F, K ) have burin facets
along the lateral edge of the distal end. Both seem to be incomplete,
but it is possible that they were of simple angle type (Epstein, 1963:
189). One (Fig. 6, K ) has evidence of two removals, the other (Fig.

THE GRANITE BEACH SITE

87

6, F ) has scars suggesting three removals. None is complete enough
for meaningful measurements.

Group IX (Fig. 7, A-L' )
No . of specimens: 1Z (3 complete, 1 rechipped, Z nearly complete, and
6 basal fragments) .
Outline form: The over-all outline is generally lanceolate with the
lateral edges at the proximal end tending to be straight (su ch as
Fig. 7, A ) or slightly concave and fla ring (such as Fig. 7, E ) . The
widest part is typically just below midpoint or across the base. On
the three complete examples the distal end is sharply pointed, being
formed by gently curving edges. The upper portions of the blade on
two of the points (Fig. 7, A, K ) are alternately beveled to the
right, while on a third (Fig. 7, C) the blade has been rather crudely
rechipped. All bases are con cave, usually markedly so. All lateral
edges at the proximal ends are smoothed, and on four specimens
(Fig. 7, D , E , H , L), the basal con cavity is smoothed.
Dimensions: Total length ( 3 complete examples only ), 3.4 (rechipped )
to 7.4 em.; maximum width, 1.7 to Z.Z em.; maximum thickness,
.5 to .7 em.; maximum depth of basal concavity , .Z to .6 em.
Weight: 5.6 to 12.4 grams.
Material: The specimens are made from locally -obtained flint or finegrained cherts which are from cream to rather dark, grayish-brown
in color.
Workmanship: Most of the Group IX exhibit excellent chipping, with
long narrow, oblique flake scars often extending across the blade.
The bases on all but two have been thinned by the removal of one
or, more commonly, several longitudinal flakes which sometimes
superficially resemble fluting. The two exceptions have been thinned
by the removal of a large crescent-shaped flake, the scar of which
has been rechipped, apparently to thin the base further. Fine marginal retouching is a common feature.
Remarks: The majority of these points conform fairly well to the
Plainview type, although two (Fig. 7, K, L ) are rather narrow- but
similar specimens have been so classified (Baker, et al., 1957, Pl. 1,
D -X ) . Another two specimens (Fig. 7, F , J) which are less well
made than the others in this group show some similarity with the

evidently having been produced by one blow. Both are on a lateral
edge, one (1.45 em. long) at the proximal end and the other (1.5
em. ) at the distal end. Minute flake scars, as well as suggestions of
smoothing, evidence use.

Group X (Fig. 8, A-H')
No . of specimens: 8 (all incomplete).
Outline form: Each of these specimens has straight to gently convex
lateral edges which tend to contract slightly at the proximal end.
The basal comers vary from rounded (Fig. 8, F) to pointed (Fig. 8,
A, C, D, H) and are occasionally asymmetrical (Fig. 8, D). The
basal concavity is usually pronounced and sometimes smoothed.
Proximal portions of the lateral edges are smoothed on all specimens.
Dimensions: Total length, estimated at about 6.5 to 7.5 em.; maximum
width (roughly at the midsection ) , 1.8 to 3 em.; maximum thickness, .5 to 1 em.; maximum depth of basal concavity, .4 to .7 em.
Weight: None complete enough to determine.
Material: The locally-obtained chert and flint from which these artifacts were produced vary in color from light tan to grayish-brown.
Workmanship: Although some specimens have long, narroW flake
scars extending across the flat surfaces, the workmanship, on the
whole, is only fair. Several have quite thick cross sections and marginal retouching is not a typical feature. The base has been thinned
-often rather poorly-by the removal of small, roughly crescentshaped flakes.
Remarks: Group X, points (especially those illustrated in Fig. 8, B, C,
D ) do not compare favorably with any established type, but they
do in some respects resemble a tentative group that Shafer (1963:
65, Fig. 7, K ) called Gower, Variant D. Another similar, though
shorter point, came from the deepest stratum at the Devil's Mouth
Site (Johnson, 1964: 54, Fig. 17, I ) .
Five of the eight examples of the group have burin facets and one
also has a graver. Three of the burins appear along a lateral edge,
two (Fig. 8, A, D) are at the distal end and are of the simple angle
type. These measure 1.5 and 1. 7 em. in length. In addition, the blunt
distal end of one of these specimens (Fig. 8, A, A') appears to have
served secondarily as a scraping or gouging tool-at least this end
has a number of small, possible use-produced flake scars. The third

lateral burin facet (Fig. 8, E ) is quite small, only .6 em. long, and
appears to have been formed by a single blow.
The two remaining burins also appear at the proximal end, but

THE GRANITE BEACH SITE

91

both are of the lateral-to-medial type. Each is .5 em. long. Finally,
it should be noted that, in addition to a burin facet, one of these
specimens (Fig. 8, B, B' ) has a very small graver projection at the
juncture of a lateral edge and a diagonal medial fracture . The tiny
beak (it projects approximately .2 em.) has been produced by
minute retouching and seems a bit smoothed, perhaps from use.

Group XI (Fig. 9, A-E')
No . of specimens: 5 (none complete)
Outline form: Because of the incompleteness of these specimens, it is
difficult to be sure of their exact form, although it is clear that each
had essentially parallel lateral edges which extended from the base
to approximately the midsection of the blade. Basal concavities are
consistently broad and very shallow. The lower portions of all the
lateral edges, and two of the basal concavities, are smoothed. On one
example (Fig. 9, B, B' ) the lateral smoothing is so extensive that it
has produced suggestions of a definable stem.
Dimensions: Total length, none complete enough to estimate accurately; maximum width, 1.8 to 2.6 em.; maximum thickness, .4 to
.7 c~.; maximum depth of basal concavity, all are less than .3 em.
Weight: Cannot be determined.
Material: The flint varies from tan to light, grayish-brown.
Workmanship: These are exceptionally well made points with long,
obliquely-parallel flake scars being very common. Their cross sections are thin and flat, and the bases have been thinned by the removal of a number of small, longitudinal flakes.
Remarks: The rectangular nature of the proximal ends of Group XI
points, as well as their thinness, are suggestive of Milnesand points
(Sellards, 1955 ). However, most of Milnesand specimens have
straight bases and points similar to Group XI points are often classed
as Plainview (Sellards, et al., 1947: Pl. 3, 4; Ochard and Campbell,
1954: Fig. 2, B).
Only one of these points exhibits a burin facet. It appears along
a lateral edge at the proximal end, has been produced by a single
blow, is .8 em. long, and seems to have been dulled by use.

Dart Point Fragments (Fig. 9, F-I )
No. of specimens: 5
Description: Each of these specimens represents better than half of a
complete point, but none has retained the more diagnostic basal
portion. As a group, they are quite well made and very probably
are fragments from Paleo types . Two (Fig. 9, H, I ) have lateral
edges alternately beveled to the right, and three have (Fig. 9, G-I )
fine marginal serrations.
PROBABLE REwoRKED DART PoiNTs (Fig. 9, J-M' )

No. of specimens: 4
'Jescription: Included in this group are specimens which appear to
have originally been dart points but which have intentionally been
rechipped into other kinds of tools. Three (Fig. 9, J-L') have long,
narrow shafts and presumably served as drills . They are bifacially
worked across both the shaft and the stem. On two (Fig. 9, I , L )
the shaft is alternately beveled to the right, while on the third specimen (Fig. 9, K ) the shaft has a lenticular cross section. The base is
broadly concave in each case, and lateral edges of the stem are
smoothed. The drills vary from 4.7 to 5.5 em. in total length, 2.1 to
2.6 em. in maximum width (across the base of the stem ), and .7 to
.9 em. in maximum thickness; while the shafts are 2.7 and 3 em.
long.
The fourth specimen (Fig. 9, M , M' ) is quite unusual in that
the distal end of the blade has been steeply beveled to produce a
scraping or gouging tool, and the proximal end exhibits at least six
separate burin blows. Five of these are essentially of the lateral type,
with the fifth .and most recent burin facet, extending diagonally
across most of the specimen. This facet is 1.9 em. long. The small
facet that appears immediately to the left of this one probably
served to sharpen the burin edge.
Remarks: Although it is reasonably clear that these are reworked dart
points, none of the flake scars resulting from rechipping are noticeably fresher than the initial flaking.
ScRAPERS (Fig. 10, A-B)
Two fairly large and well made flake scrapers represent the only
unifacially-chipped stone artifacts recovered from the site. Both are
plano-convex in cross section and have steep marginal retouching

along all, or nearly all, marginals. The flaking does not, however, extend across the entire convex face. The plano surface is unaltered and
on one specimen (Fig. 10, B' ) a prepared striking platform is still
visible. The lack of a distinct bulb of percussion and the prominent
lipping just below the striking platform suggest that the flake used to
make this scraper was detached from the core by means of the billet
percussion technique. Diagnostic t1ake scars are not present on the
plano surface of the other scraper.
Only one (Fig. 10, A, A' ) of these specimens appears to have been
intentionally shaped, and has a distinct crescent-shaped outline. At one
end of the other scraper there is a rather prominent graver which has
been produced by chipping side-by-side two shallow concavities.

THE GRANITE BEACH SITE

95

These scrapers are 5.4 and 7.3 em. long, 2.5 and 2.8 em. in maximum width, and .6 and . 7 em. in maximum thickness respectively.
The graver beak projects .2 em. One (Fig. 10, A ) is made of honeycolored flint, the other (Fig. 10, B) of bluish-gray flint. The latter has
a few traces of light-colored nodular cortex.
GROOVED STONE (Fig. 10, C)
A flattish , somewhat naturally ovoid-shaped piece of fine-grained
sandstone has a narrow groove pecked all around the long axis. Additional pecking scars are visible along one lateral edge and portions of
one end-these are, however, too sparse to have significantly modified
the natural shape of the stone. Both surfaces are lightly smoothed,
perhaps from use. The groove is generally about .5 em. wide and less
than 2 em. deep. The stone itself is 5.5 em. long, a maximum of 5 em.
wide, and a maximum of 2.4 em. thick. It weighs 88.4 grams.
GRINDING SLAB (not illustrated )
The only other specimen collected from the site is granite grinding
slab with a shallow depression on each flat surface. This piece has,
unfortunately, been lost and the only dimensions recorded are that it
was 25 em. long, 21 .5 em. wide, and 4 em. thick.
SUMMARY

Although all from the surface, the artifacts-especially the dart
points-from the Granite Beach Site comprise an unusual collection.
They exhibit considerable morphological variation and, yet, fall within
a significantly restricted range. In terms of outline form, workmanship, and the high incidence of lateral and basal smoothing, dart point
Groups VI through XI are stylistically related to the Paleo-Indian
tradition, particularly to types Angostura, Plainview, and Meserve.
On the other hand, Groups I through V show affinity with the Archaic
tradition in that they are generally less skillfully made, frequently
have well defined, occasionally barbed shoulders, and their stems are
not usually smoothed. Additionally, the occurrence of burins is much
less frequent than in Groups VI-XI, supporting an earlier observation
made by Epstein (1963: 191-194) .
The data are still incomplete but it appears that most, if not all, of
the Archaic dart points from the Granite Beach Site are-relatively
speaking-early forms. Shafer (1963: 79-81) has reported specimens
quite similar to Group I (his Gower type and Gower variants) as being

96

stratigraphically below types Wells, Morrill, Bulverde, Nolan, and
Pedernales. Another point somewhat similar to one of the Group I
specimens (see Fig. 3, A, A' ) was found at the Devil's Mouth Site,
in the same stratum that yielded Plainview golondrina and other PaleoIndian looking projectile points (Johnson, 1964: 46-58). Groups II-V
are more difficult to place, but they could also be early Archaic styles .
The Granite Beach Site appears to have been a campsite rather
than a killsite, as occupational features, especially hearths (see Table
I) were numerous and chipping debris was observed but not collected.
On the other hand, it must be admitted that the absence of certain kinds
of tools, such as knives and choppers, as well as the unusually high
incidence of dart points ( 73 of a total of 81 artifacts) is not the assemblage one might ordinarily expect to find at a campsite.
The diversity of dart points represented at the site suggests repeated
occupation, extending perhaps from late Paleo-Indian times to the
early Archaic period. Whether or not the hearths and stone piles also
gradually accumulated over a comparable span of time is not known.
None of these features were systematically investigated, nor were any
of the artifacts found in direct association with them. Perhaps this and
other problems which surround the site can be answered when Lake
Buchanan again recedes.
