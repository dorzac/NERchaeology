s rmu mn of ped Projectile Points
in Texas
Elton R. Prewitt

ABSTRACT
Distribution and density data for 151 projectile point types currently recognized in Texas are presented in
a series of maps. Drawn from 736 sources, the data encompassing 60,519 projectile points show generalized
distribution areas. Gaps are indicated in the 67 (of 254) counties which lack published data, and in the 110
counties represented by three or fewer reports. While extensive, the database is limited and does not include every
published source that deals with Texas archeology.

INTRODUCTION
During the period ! 980-821 reviewed 428 journal articles and monographs to compile distribution
data for projectile points at the county level for the
state of Texas. Subsequently, numerous people have
been subjected to my admonishments that
unquantified perceptions of type distributions are
not necessarily accurate. When I was approached to
write an overview of a particular region of the state
for this volume of the Bulletin, I returned a counterproposal to update the point type data and present
an article consisting of distribution and density maps
with no accompanying interpretation. The proposal
was accepted, and I reviewed another 308 articles
and monographs for a total of 736 bibliographic
entries. For the most part the sources are readily
obtainable, but the list is by no means complete.
In general, reports published before 1947 are
not included in the review. These early reports tend
to be very difficult to work with because of incomplete descriptions and poor illustrations. This makes
typological assignments difficult and uncertain. The
cutoff date for recent reports is December 1994. A
number of reports dated 1994 but which were not
received before March 1995 are not included either. Other omissions include many theses and dissertations, and some local or regional journals. The
Record published by the Dallas Archeological Society, for example, was not readily available and is
not included. A glance at the database sources will
quickly reveal the journals utilized. Reports published by private contracting firms are included

where possible, but some firms provide minimal
distribution of their reports. The final source not
consulted is the compliance and review holdings of
the Texas Historical Commission. The primary caveat is that this review of the literature is extensive,
but it is certainly not comprehensive.
Readers will find that the distribution and density data presented in this article varies from their
firsthand knowledge. Reactions will vary, but I expect most will be along the lines of "This map is
wrong; it does not show type Zeta in Alpha County,
and I have 49 Zeta points from there in my collection!" My advance reply to all such comments is
simple: publish descriptions of your collections so
the rest of us can use the information. It is just as
important to remember that, while these maps may
not show a particular type extending into a nearby
county, it does not mean the type cannot occur
there. The accuracy of the maps reflects the accuracy of published data, and as is demonstrated later
in this article, there are large gaps in the existing
database.

METHODS
Each report was examined critically in regard
to typological assignments. Written descriptions and
illustrations were compared to my own set of
illustrations and descriptions as well as to standard
references such as Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954),
Suhm and Jelks (1962), Bell (1958, 1960), Perino
(1968, 1971), Chapman (1975, 1980), and Turner
and Hester (1985, 1993). Detectable errors in

typological assignment were corrected. A number
of reports were disregarded as unusable because,
although type names and quantities were given,
there were inadequate descriptions and few or no
illustrations.
Also not used are articles devoted exclusively
to descriptions of single point types or to surveys of
point types. It was extremely difficult to sort out
specimens already reported in other sources from
those previously unreported. Rather than bias the
sample with an unknown quautity of duplicate entries, these two types of articles were disregarded.
This created a different problem in a number of
instances where quantities of reported specimens
are low: some types are seriously under-represented
in the database compared to the published distributions. Notable examples include Axtell (Prewitt and
Chandler 1992), Caracara (Saunders and Hester
1993), Clovis (Meltzer 1987; see also Meltzer and
Bever, this volume), Folsom (Largent, Waters, and
Carlson 1991) and Jetta (Hester 1979). Several
types, especially recently named groups such as
Devils (Turpin and Bement 1992), do not appear at
all in the database.
Adjustments have been made in the definition
of a few point types. Neches River is used as originally defined by Kent ( 1961; see also Jelks 1965:Figure 72A-F). The Oletha variety of Neches River
(Prewitt 1974:66-67) is treated as a separate type
rather than as a variety, and the name is accordingly
given as Oletha. Baird and Taylor are used as defined by Kelley (1947), while Tortugas is used for
those specimens not clearly assignable to the earlier
two types. One type only cursorily defined in print
is used: the Zephyr (Prewitt 1976) category includes
specimens formerly subsumed along with Hoxie
under Darl, and the Mahomet designation (originally proposed as a variety) is dropped in favor of
using Darl. Another type not yet defined in print is
Merrell; closely resembling and usually misidentified
as Frio, published examples of this type can be
found in Campbell (1948:Plate 3A9), Suhm and
Jelks (1962:Plate 98C, E) and Sorrow, Shafer and
Ross (1967:Figure 15d).
Data were compiled on worksheets that contained a reference number, county, site number, site
name (or other identifier as appropriate), type code
number, type name, quantity, and short bibliographic reference. Reference numbers were assigned in sequential order of review; these numbers
are included in parentheses following the authorsâ

names in the alphabetical listing of database
sources. Type codes are taken from my as yet unpublished compilation of type names (with dates
and references) that have been used in Texas or
proposed for use in print. Type names are sometimes used with a following question (?) mark, or
in other cases have "-like" appended. These reflect
uncertainties by either the original analyst, myself,
or both. I felt that these specimens should be included on a broad scale so that if they formed distinctive distribution patterns, then we should look
toward defining new types or varieties. In most
cases the questionable specimens did not alter distributions for the types as a whole, so they were
included in the final density maps. However, in a
very few cases questionable specimens occurred at
considerable distances from the core distribution
areas. These were reviewed once more, and in all
but two instances the specimens were removed
from the final density maps.
The data sheets for the first 428 reports were
entered into the Excel spreadsheet application on a
Macintosh IIsi. After initial proofing and manipulation, the data were shipped into the Quattro Pro
spreadsheet application on a Dell 486DX, and the
additional 308 reports were entered. The entire compilation was imported into the Paradox database
application where final sorting and preparations
were made. This database was then imported into
the Mapviewer thematic mapping application where
the individual distribution maps were created.
Preceding the projectile point maps are two
key maps that aid in evaluating the distributions.
Figure la illustrates the distribution and density of
reports per county included in the database. Because some reports cover multiple counties they are
tallied more than one time. Thus, 736 sources are
counted as 822 in this figure. Sixty-seven counties
(26 percent) lack reported data (keep in mind that
the database is extensive, but it is not complete),
while 110 counties (43 percent) are represented by
one to three reports, 60 counties (24 percent) by
four to nine reports, and 17 counties (7 percent) by
ten or more reports (n=276, or 33.5 percent). The
five counties with the greatest numbers of reports
(15 percent) are Bexar (32), Val Verde (27), Travis
(23), Harris (22), and Williamson (22).
Figure lb illustrates the distribution and density of 60,519 projectile points by county. As noted
above, 67 counties (26 percent) lack reported data
while 103 counties (40.5 percent) are represented

101 to 1,000 points, and 14 counties (5.5 percent)
by more than 1,000 points. The five counties with
the greatest numbers of points are Wittiamson with
10,236 (16.7 percent), Val Verde with 4,642 (8
percent), Travis with 2,081 (3.5 percent), Rockwall
with 1,732 (3 percent), and Hill with 1,660 (3 percent). These five counties (2 percent) contain 20,351
(33.6 percent) of the points in the database, while
the 14 counties (5.5 percent) with more than 1,000
points contain 32,491 (53.7 percent) of the points.
The distribution and density maps are presented
in alphabetical order beginning with Abasolo in
Figure 2a. Each map is accompanied by an
illustration of the type. Key references provided for
each type are indicated by one or more numbers
enclosed in parentheses following the type name.
These numbers (from 1-36) refer to entries listed in
the References Cited, not the Projectile Point Data
Base Sources (no. 1-736). Additional interpretive
information such as arrow point or dart point, age
estimates, and period assignments are not included
in order for the distributions to be presented as free
of interpretation as possible. Distributions are
presented in a shaded density format with darker
shading indicating higher density. Values remain
constant for all of the types.
The database is maintained on file at the ofrices of Prewitt and Associates, Inc., 7701 North
Lamar Blvd., Suite 104, Austin, Texas 78752-1012.
Should one desire to review the actual numbers or
obtain a copy of the database, inquiries should be
