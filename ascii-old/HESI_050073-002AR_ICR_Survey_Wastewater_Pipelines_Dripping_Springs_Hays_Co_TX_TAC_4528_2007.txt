MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The City of Dripping Springs is proposing to build a new wastewater treatment plant
(WWTP) and associated wastewater pipeline system in the City of Dripping Springs, Hays
County, Texas. The WWTP facility would be constructed on an approximately 16-hectare (ha)
(40-acre [ac]) property located about 1.2 kilometers (km) (0.8 mile [mi]) southeast of the
intersection of Ranch Road (RR) 12 and RR 150 south of Dripping Springs. The associated
wastewater pipelines would be installed primarily within existing roadways as well as within an
easement consisting of a proposed 46-meter- (m-) (150-foot- [ft-]) wide new right-of-way. The
total length of the proposed pipeline system would be approximately 13 km (8 mi). As currently
defined, the area of potential effect (APE) associated with the overall project consists of the 16ha (40-ac) WWTP property, which is currently an undeveloped tall-grass pasture, as well as the
13-km (8-mi) wastewater pipeline system.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Dripping Springs, an
agency of the State of Texas, using a loan from the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB);
as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. As this
undertaking represents a project sponsored by the City of Dripping Springs, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, with the potential to damage or destroy cultural resources, the
City of Dripping Springs was required to provide for a cultural resource survey of the APE. On
behalf of the City of Dripping Springs, CMA Engineering, Inc. (CMA), the City of Dripping
Springs’ contractor for this project, retained Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to
obtain the necessary cultural resource clearances for the project.
In 2005, Horizon performed an intensive cultural resource survey of the proposed site of
the 16-ha (40-ac) WWTP facility and a 0.2-km (0.1-mi) segment of proposed new pipeline rightof-way extending from the existing right-of-way of RR 150 to the proposed WWTP facility under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3782. At the same time, Horizon conducted a reconnaissance
survey of the proposed wastewater pipeline system, which was to be installed within or
immediately adjacent to existing road rights-of-way. No cultural resources, historic or
prehistoric, were documented as a result of Horizon’s 2005 survey of the Dripping Springs
Wastewater System project area (Owens 2005). The Texas Historical Commission (THC)
concurred with Horizon’s recommended findings of no effect on historic properties, and the
proposed undertaking was cleared to proceed.

Management Summary

Since the 2005 cultural resources survey was performed, 2 segments of proposed
pipeline right-of-way totaling 3.2 km (2.0 mi) have been modified from the original project
design. While the location of the WWTP has remained the same, 3.2 km (2.0 mi) of the
proposed pipeline right-of-way extending along RR 12 between the WWTP facility and the City
of Dripping Springs, which was previously to be installed entirely within the existing right-of-way
of RR 12, have been rerouted to include areas of previously unsurveyed proposed new right-ofway. Beginning at the proposed WWTP facility, the proposed pipeline reroute would traverse
approximately 1.1 km (0.7 mi) of undeveloped pasture and cross to the north side of RR 150
near the intersection of RR 150 and RR 12. From this point, the proposed pipeline reroute
would head northward within the existing RR 12 right-of-way, which was surveyed during the
2005 survey, to Walnut Springs. At Walnut Springs, the proposed pipeline reroute would depart
from the existing RR 12 right-of-way and head 2.1 km (1.3 mi) across another largely
undeveloped pasture to articulate with RR 12 and US Highway 290. Finally, minor modifications
have been made to the design of the gathering line distribution system within Dripping Springs;
however, all areas within town were examined during the 2005 survey and were not revisited
during the current survey effort.
Thus, the majority of the proposed Dripping Springs Wastewater System project area
was previously surveyed for cultural resources by Horizon (Owens 2005). The APE of the
current phase of the project consists only of the 2 rerouted pipeline segments to be installed
within previously unsurveyed right-of-way totaling 3.2 km (2.0 mi). The APE of the current
survey undertaking therefore extends a total of 3.2 km (2.0 mi) within a linear corridor
measuring 46 m (150 ft) in width, covering a total area of 15 ha (36 ac). As the Texas
Antiquities Permit (No. 3782) for the 2005 survey had been fulfilled and closed, the THC issued
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4528 for the survey of the rerouted portion of the APE.
On 16 May 2007, Horizon archeologists Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema, under the
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resource
survey of the previously unsurveyed 3.2 km (2.0 mi) of proposed pipeline reroutes. A total of
43 shovel tests were excavated in the APE, including 21 in the northern, 2.1-km- (1.3-mi-) long
segment of the APE and 22 in the southern, 1.1-km- (0.7-mi-) long segment; the Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) requirements were met or exceeded for a
project area of this length. Backhoe trenching was not conducted during this survey as no
areas with moderate to high probabilities for cultural materials at depths exceeding 1.0 m (3.3 ft)
below surface (i.e., deeper than shovel testing would be capable of detecting) were identified.
The southern portion of the APE is situated adjacent to Onion Creek, but this stretch of Onion
Creek consists of a relatively deeply incised stream channel, and floodplains and terrace
environments composed of deep alluvial packages are lacking within the project area.
The survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new archeological site (41HY434). Site
41HY434 consists of a moderate- to high-density scatter of aboriginal artifacts largely confined
to the modern ground surface of an open pasture at the junction of the clayey and marly eastern
terrace of Onion Creek and the adjacent uplands. One of 7 shovel tests excavated on the site
produced an artifact from subsurface contexts; however, the site contains only shallow, gravelly
clayey sediments measuring from 15 to 20 centimeters (cm) in depth overlying marly clay

subsoil. While the preponderance of chert cores, lithic debitage, and large, early-stage bifaces
suggests that the primary function of the aboriginal occupation of site 41HY434 was lithic raw
material procurements (i.e., “quarrying”) from nearby chert-bearing gravel exposures, the
presence of occasional fragments of burned rock and fire-reddened chert cobbles suggests that
cultural features, such as hearths or chert heat-treating facilities, suggests that more
generalized campsite-related activities may also have occurred on the site. While the variety
and density of artifact types on the site attests to aboriginal activity on the site, the lack of
diagnostic artifacts precludes pinpointing the age or cultural affiliation of the aboriginal
occupation (aside from a possible Archaic association suggested by the predominance of large,
early-stage bifaces). Furthermore, observed cultural materials are confined largely to the
modern ground surface of a pasture that has apparently experienced some degree of erosion
and deflation as a result of historic land use practices and lack integrity. The presence of small
quantities of burned rock suggests that cultural features may once have been present on the
site, but any such features appear to have been disturbed by prior erosional and agricultural
activities and are no longer extant. Due to the surficial context, lack of diagnostic artifacts, lack
of organic remains, and lack of integrity resulting from prior disturbances to the site, the
investigated area of site 41HY434 does not appear to possess significant potential to contribute
to an enhanced understanding of the prehistoric past under Criterion D of the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP), and the site does not possess characteristics warranting eligibility
under Criteria A, B, or C. While undocumented areas of site 41HY434 may be present east and
west of the documented site boundaries, the investigated portion of the site is recommended as
ineligible for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). No further investigations
are recommended on site 41HY434 in connection with the Dripping Springs Wastewater
Treatment System project.
In addition to the archeological site, the Phillips Cemetery, a historic-age cemetery, is
located on the west side of RR 12 just north of the intersection of RR 12 and RR 150. The
proposed pipeline would be installed within the existing right-of-way of RR 12 on the east side of
the existing pavement (i.e., on the opposite side of the road from the cemetery). While the
proposed undertaking would not result in any impacts to the Phillips Cemetery, the existing
right-of-way on the west side of RR 12 (i.e., in front of the Phillips Cemetery) was surveyed in
the interest of verifying that no undocumented remains associated within the cemetery exist
within the existing right-of-way. The survey confirmed that no previously undocumented
remains associated with the Phillips Cemetery would be impacted by proposed construction.
In accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, Horizon has made a
reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural
resources were identified that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR
60.4 or for designation as SALs according to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26.12, no
further archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. It is
recommended that the proposed project be cleared to proceed. However, in the unlikely event
that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work should cease immediately and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

Dripping Springs Wastewater Treatment System Project, Dripping Springs, Hays County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The City of Dripping Springs is proposing to build a new wastewater treatment plant
(WWTP) and associated wastewater pipeline system in the City of Dripping Springs, Hays
County, Texas (Figure 1). The WWTP facility would be constructed on an approximately 16hectare (ha) (40-acre [ac]) property located about 1.2 kilometers (km) (0.8 mile [mi]) southeast
of the intersection of Ranch Road (RR) 12 and RR 150 south of Dripping Springs. The
associated wastewater pipelines would be installed primarily within existing roadways as well as
within easements consisting of a proposed 46-meter- (m-) (150-foot- [ft-]) wide new right-of-way.
The total length of the proposed pipeline system would be approximately 13 km (8 mi). As
currently defined, the area of potential effect (APE) associated with the overall project consists
of the 16-ha (40-ac) WWTP property, which is currently an undeveloped tall-grass pasture, as
well as the 13-km (8-mi) wastewater pipeline system.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Dripping Springs, an
agency of the State of Texas, using a loan from the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB);
as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural
Resource Code of 1977 [revised 1987], Title 9, Chapter 191, VACS, Art. 6145-9). As this
undertaking represents a project sponsored by the City of Dripping Springs, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, with the potential to damage or destroy cultural resources, the
City of Dripping Springs was required to provide for a cultural resource survey of the APE under
the jurisdiction of the Texas Antiquities Code. On behalf of the City of Dripping Springs, CMA
Engineering, Inc. (CMA), the City of Dripping Springs’ contractor for this project, retained
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to obtain the necessary cultural resource
clearances for the project.
In 2005, Horizon performed an intensive cultural resource survey of the proposed site of
the 16-ha (40-ac) WWTP facility and a 0.2-km (0.1-mi) segment of proposed new pipeline rightof-way extending from the existing right-of-way of RR 150 to the proposed WWTP facility under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3782. At the same time, Horizon conducted a reconnaissance
survey of the proposed wastewater pipeline system, which was to be installed within or
immediately adjacent to existing road rights-of-way. No cultural resources, historic or
prehistoric, were documented as a result of Horizon’s 2005 survey of the Dripping Springs
Wastewater System project area (Owens 2005). The Texas Historical Commission (THC)

proposed undertaking was cleared to proceed.
Since the 2005 cultural resources survey was performed, 2 segments of proposed

approximately 1.1 km (0.7 mi) of undeveloped pasture and cross to the north side of RR 150
near the intersection of RR 150 and RR 12. From this point, the proposed pipeline reroute
would head northward within the existing RR 12 right-of-way, which was surveyed during the

minor modifications have been made to the design of the gathering line distribution system
within Dripping Springs; however, all areas within town were examined during the 2005 survey
and were not revisited during the current effort.

Antiquities Permit (No. 3782) for the 2005 survey had been fulfilled and closed, the THC issued
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4528 for the survey of the rerouted portion of the APE.
On 16 May 2007, Horizon archeologists Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema, under the
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resource
survey of the previously unsurveyed 3.2 km (2.0 mi) of proposed pipeline reroutes. This survey
was conducted by Horizon under subcontract to CMA on behalf of the City of Dripping Springs.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Dripping Springs Wastewater System project area is located in northern Hays
County in southern Central Texas, southwest of the City of Austin, near the boundary of
2 significant physiographic provinces—the Edwards Plateau and the Blackland Prairie. The
Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards Plateau on the
west and the Gulf Coastal Plain on the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band
along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern
Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief
and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle
gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault
system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily
of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this
boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more
gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of
topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life. The City of Dripping Springs
is situated in the dissected canyonlands along the rim of the Edwards Plateau north and east of
Onion Creek, a major tributary of the Colorado River. Elevations across the project area range
from approximately 332 m (1,090 ft) above mean sea level (amsl) adjacent to Onion Creek to
372 m (1,220 ft) amsl in the dissected uplands north of the City of Dripping Springs (USGS
1986).
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the Colorado River basin. Hays
County’s numerous streams generally flow in an easterly direction. The principal waterways are
Bear, Cypress, and Onion creeks as well as the Blanco and San Marcos rivers. The Edwards
Aquifer underlies the eastern portion of the county, and the San Marcos Springs, located near
the southern edge of the county north of the City of San Marcos, are the second largest in
Texas, delivering over 102 million gallons daily. The proposed WWTP facility is located
adjacent to Onion Creek, and the closest approach of this stream to the project area occurs
where it flows 0.5 km (0.3 mi) west of the intersection of RR 12 and R 150. The terrain near the
creek is characterized by steep slopes and benches in the upper and middle reaches and is
generally flat to rolling in the lower reaches. Shallow clay loams to deeper sand and clay
support juniper, live oak, mesquite, and grasses. Onion Creek flows southwest of the City of

Dripping Springs in a generally southeasterly direction before turning to the northeast and
discharging into the Colorado River southeast of Austin, Texas, approximately 47 km (29 mi)
east of the project area. The Colorado River, in turn, flows southeastward across the Blackland
Prairie and the Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance
northeast of Matagorda Bay.
Several unnamed tributaries of Onion Creek, all of which are relatively deeply incised
into the native limestone bedrock, traverse various segments of the proposed wastewater
gathering pipelines. Walnut Springs is located south of town a short distance west of RR 12, a
segment of road along which the proposed gathering lines will run on the east side of the road.
The Dripping Springs, after which the city is named, are located in town.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age, sedimentary rock
strata; specifically, the project area is underlain by the Glen Rose Formation of the Trinity
Group, which was deposited in a broad, shallow sea 100 to 114 million years ago during the
Cretaceous Period (Barnes 1981). Deposition extended southward from an ancient shoreline in
the Llano area. The Glen Rose Formation is part of an assemblage of sedimentary rocks
known as the Trinity Group. Trinity-age sediments reflect 3 periods of the ancient sea’s inland
expansion; the Glen Rose was deposited during the last of these 3 periods.
The project area is situated on the Brackett-Comfort-Real soil association (Batte 1984).
The Brackett-Comfort-Real Association is composed of shallow, undulating to steep soils over
limestone or strongly cemented chalk and is characteristic of upland environments on the
Edwards Plateau. The parent material of in situ soils in the vicinity of the project area is the
indurated limestone bedrock that underlies the region. Closer to the Colorado River, soils
formed over alluvium of recent and Pleistocene age, but no substantial alluvial deposits are
present in the vicinity of the project area.
The property on which the proposed WWTP facility would be constructed is situated on
3 specific soil series—Krum clay, 1 to 3% slopes (KrB); Sunev clay loam, 1 to 3% slopes (SuB);
and Bracket-Rock outcrop-Comfort complex, undulating (BtD). The KrB and SuB units
compose the vast majority of the WWTP facility in roughly equal proportions, while the BtD soil
unit is restricted to a thin band paralleling RR 150.
The Krum clay, 1 to 3% slopes (KrB), soil unit is a deep, gently sloping soil found on
stream terraces and valley fills. A representative profile consists of a surface layer of dark gray
clay about 41 centimeters (cm) (16 inches [in]) thick underlain by grayish-brown clay subsoil to a
depth of 147 cm (58 in). This layer overlies brown clay, which extends to a depth of 168 cm
(66 in), which is in turn underlain by pale brown clay to a depth of 203 cm (80 in).
The Sunev clay loam, 1 to 3% slopes (SuB), soil series is a deep, gently sloping soil
found on valley slopes and foot slopes of hills on uplands on the Edwards Plateau. Typically,
the surface layer is dark grayish-brown clay loam about 28 cm (11 in) thick underlain by brown
clay loam subsoil to a depth of 89 cm (35 in), which overlies reddish-yellow clay loam to a depth

of 114 cm (45 in). The latter stratum is composed of about 15%, by volume, soft masses and
concretions of calcium carbonate. The BtD soil unit consists of shallow, loamy and clayey soils
on rock outcrop that occurs on Edwards Plateau uplands. Slopes are convex and range from
1 to 8%, and many areas have a benched appearance because of the horizontal bands of rock
outcrop.
Brackett-Rock outcrop-Comfort complex, undulating (BtD), consists of shallow, loamy
and clayey soils and rock outcrops that occur on uplands throughout the Edwards Plateau.
Slopes are convex and range from 1 to 8%. Many areas have a benched appearance along hill
slopes due to the horizontal bands of rock outcrops. The Brackett soil makes up 30 to 60% of
the complex, rock outcrop composes between 10 and 45%, and Comfort and similar soils make
up 10 to 20%. Typically, the surface layer of the Brackett soil is grayish-brown, gravelly clay
loam about 15 cm (6 in) thick, underlain by pale brown and pale yellow gravelly clay loam to a
depth of about 43 cm (17 in). Underlying material is weakly cemented limestone interbedded
with thin layers of indurated limestone, and the soil is moderately alkaline and calcareous
throughout. Rock outcrop consists of exposures of limestone bedrock. Soil occasionally occurs
in lenses up to 8 cm (3 in) thick overlying flat rock, but most soil occurs only in narrow fractures
in the rock. Finally, the Comfort soil is dark brown, extremely stony clay to a depth of about
10 cm (4 in), underlain by dark reddish-brown, extremely stony clay to a depth of 28 cm (11 in).
The underlying material is indurated, fractured limestone, and the soil is moderately alkaline and
calcareous throughout.
The proposed wastewater pipelines traverse a total of 8 distinct soil series within and in
the vicinity of the City of Dripping Springs—Bracket-Rock outcrop-Comfort complex, undulating
(BtD); Comfort-Rock outcrop complex, undulating (CrD); Denton silty clay, 1 to 3% slopes
(DeB); Doss silty clay, 1 to 5% slopes (DoC); Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex, steep (ErG); Krum
clay, 1 to 3% slopes (KrB); Real-Comfort-Doss complex, undulating (RcD); and Sunev clay
loam, 1 to 3% slopes (SuB). Three of these soil units are discussed above; the remaining 5 soil
series are described below.
Comfort-Rock outcrop complex, undulating (CrD), consists of shallow, clayey soils and
rock outcrop on sideslopes and on hilltops and ridge tops on uplands in the Edwards Plateau.
This soil type combines the characteristics of the Comfort soil and rock outcrop described above
for the Brackett-Rock outcrop-Comfort complex, undulating (BtD), soil unit.
Denton silty clay, 1 to 3% slopes (DeB), is a moderately deep, gently sloping soil on
valley slopes that occurs on uplands of the Edwards Plateau. Typically, the surface layer is
dark grayish-brown silty clay about 36 cm (14 in) thick, below which is dark brown silty clay to a
depth of 64 cm (25 in), which in turn overlies yellowish-brown silty clay to a depth of 84 cm
(33 in). The underlying material is light brown and reddish-yellow clay to a depth of 91 cm
(36 in). This soil is moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout, and it is well drained.
Doss silty clay, 1 to 5% slopes (DoC), is a gently rolling soil on convex slopes of low hills
and ridges. A typical profile consists of dark grayish-brown silty clay to a depth of 23 cm (9 in),
underlain by yellowish-brown clay loam to a depth of 46 cm (18 in), about 50% of which is

composed of calcium carbonate. The underlying material to a depth of 61 cm (24 in) is weakly
cemented limestone and marl.
Real-Comfort-Doss complex, undulating (RcD), consists of shallow, loamy and clayey
soils on low hills and ridges on uplands. Real soil makes up 22 to 54% of the complex (40% on
average), the Comfort soil makes up 18 to 40% (30% on average), the Doss soil makes up 9 to
39% (20% on average), and miscellaneous other soils comprise the remainder. Typically, the
surface layer of the Real soil is very dark grayish-brown gravelly loam about 20 cm (8 in) thick,
of which the upper portion is about 25%, by volume, angular gravel of limestone and caliche and
the lower part is about 55% fragments of similar material. The underlying material is weakly
cemented limestone interbedded with thin layers of indurated limestone. The Comfort soil is
typically composed of dark brown, very stony clay about 18 cm (7 in) thick underlain by dark
reddish-brown, extremely stony clay to a depth of 30 cm (13 in), which in turn overlies indurated
fractured limestone. The Doss soil is dark brown clay loam about 18 cm (7 in) thick underlain by
reddish-brown clay loam to a depth of 30 cm (12 in), about 15% of which is limestone and
caliche gravel. The underlying material is weakly cemented limestone and marl. All 3 soil units
are moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout.
Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex, steep (ErG), consists of shallow, clayey soils and rock
outcrop on uplands in the Edwards Plateau. The Eckrant soil makes up 50 to 80% of the
complex, rock outcrop composes between 9 and 30%, and other miscellaneous soils make up
the remainder. Typically, the surface layer of the Eckrant soil is very dark gray, extremely stony
clay about 25 cm (10 in) thick. This layer is about 35%, by volume, cobbles and stones in the
upper part and about 75%, by volume, stones in the lower part. The underlying layer is
indurated, fractured limestone, and the soil is moderately alkaline and non-calcareous
throughout.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway

Cultural Resources Survey of 2.4 Miles of Proposed Pipeline Reroutes
Dripping Springs Wastewater Treatment System Project, Dripping Springs, Hays County, Texas

(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Hays County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 cm (32 in) and temperature
averages 19°Celsius (C) (67°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the
warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier
periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to
25 in), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall.
Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an 18-hour period
in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge that fell in less
than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of
winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for
moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over
meridianal flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather
than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region, and
rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

BIOTA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943).
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The
boundary, characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian
provinces passes through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in
the Texan province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite
(1948) as a C2 (moist subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this
soil type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas
include the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies. Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat
and bog marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana),
hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), blacktailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the
Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—
occur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found,
including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis)
(grassland species), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard
(Sceloporus olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink
(Eumeces obsoletus) (forest species). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this
area, including small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander
(Ambystoma tigrinum), and eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts
as a barrier to urodele distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west
and the Austroriparian fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the
Texan into the Austroriparian province include Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s

chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water
snake (Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early
historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of
North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly
through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P. [Collins 1995]). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late

HJN 050073.002 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P. [Collins 1995]). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P. [Collins 1995]) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The

14

050073-002_arch_survey_report.docx

Cultural Resources Survey of 2.4 Miles of Proposed Pipeline Reroutes

first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement
of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished.
During the Spanish period, the region lay at the edge of the main route from San Antonio
to East Texas, the Old San Antonio Road1. In 1691, Domingo Terán de los Ríos crossed the
southern edge of the county on his way to the East Texas missions and the Red River. The
Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition explored the upper San Marcos River in 1709, and Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis was attacked by Apaches in 1714 at the San Marcos River crossing. A
mission to be called San Marcos was authorized in 1729 near the site of present San Marcos,
but the authorization was later rescinded in favor of San Antonio. San Xavier Mission and San
Francisco Xavier Presidio were located briefly at the site in 1755-56, but no permanent
settlement was attempted until 1807, when some 80 persons were moved to the Old San
Antonio Road crossing of the San Marcos River. San Marcos de Neve, 1 of a chain of defense
settlements, was abandoned 4 years later, after flooding and attacks by Comanche and
Tonkawa Indians. To encourage settlement after the Mexican War for Independence, the
government of Coahuila and Texas issued land grants in the county to Juan Martín Veramendi
in 1831, Juan Vicente Campos in 1832, and Thomas Jefferson Chambers in 1834. The first
Anglo-American settler in Hays County, Thomas G. McGehee, was issued a league of land in
1835 by the Mexican government and was farming north of the site of present San Marcos in
1846.
On 1 March 1848, the state legislature formed Hays County from territory formerly part
of Travis County. William W. Moon, Eli T. Merriman, and Mike Sessom, original settlers and
members of John Coffee Hays’ company of Texas Rangers, worked with General Edward
Burleson, a member of the Texas Senate, to have the new county named for Hays. County
organization and the designation of San Marcos as the county seat gave impetus to settlement;
the population grew from 387 in 1850 to 2,126 in 1860. The county shrank slightly on
12 February 1858, when it lost acreage to the new Blanco County and gained a portion of
Comal County. On 10 January 1862, the legislature again transferred another small area to
Blanco County. Boundaries remained stable for nearly a century, until resurvey of the HaysTravis county line in 1955 added more than 16,000 acres to Hays County.
A stage line from Austin to San Antonio crossed the county in 1848, the year that
Edward Burleson built the first sawmill. W.A. Thompson built the first cotton gin in the early
1850s, and, between 1855 and 1885, Ezekiel Nance built and operated 5 gins, 5 gristmills, a
sawmill, a shingle mill, and a beef packery. Alfred B.F. Kerr organized the first church in Hays

County in 1847, and a school was built at San Marcos in 1849. Another school was opened at
Snake Lake in 1851, and John D. Pitts built a school in Stringtown before 1860. The Johnson
Institute, founded in 1852 by Thomas Jefferson Johnson, drew students from a large area of
Central Texas until it closed in 1872.
The early settlers of Hays County were a mix of old Texans and Georgia and Arkansas
immigrants. With the coming of the Civil War, most of the residents favored secession. Colonel
Peter C. Woods’ 36th Texas Cavalry regiment was organized at Camp Clark, in neighboring
Guadalupe County, in 1862; Company A was primarily made up of Hays County men. During
the war, county beef helped to feed Confederate forces. Shortly after the war’s end, Colonel
George F. Snyder, a Georgian, established the first newspaper in Hays County, the Pioneer.
During Reconstruction, a Ku Klux Klan group was formed, and, in May 1876, a military
organization, the San Marcos Greys, was formed.
George Neill drove the first herd of cattle from Hays County to Kansas in 1867, and
other drives followed. Farming also became more profitable in the eastern part of the county
and helped encourage a fresh influx of settlers. By 1878, the county was out of debt, several
new communities had been organized, and schools had grown in number to match the
increased population. The Coronal Institute was founded in 1866 followed by the San Marcos
public school system in 1870. Southwest Texas Normal School was authorized at the turn of
the century and opened in 1903 as a teacher-training institution; it became Southwest Texas
State University in 1969. San Marcos Baptist Academy was established in 1907.
In 1880, the first Hays County rail line, built by the International-Great Northern Railroad,
was completed to San Marcos from Austin; it later extended to San Antonio. Another population
boom followed the railroad. The county population nearly doubled, from 7,555 in 1880 to
14,142 in 1900, and then remained virtually unchanged for the next 50 years despite the
influences of World War I and the depression of the 1930s. Even the economic stimulus of
World War II had only momentary effect. Hays County remained predominantly agricultural;
almost 90% of the mid-1960s farm income came from livestock. Not until the establishment of
the Gary Job Corps Training Center on the site of the former Gary Air Force Base in 1964 and
the growth of enrollment at the university in San Marcos did Hays County begin a period of
steady growth—from 19,934 in 1960 to 27,642 in 1970; 40,594 in 1980; and 65,614 in 1990.
Although agriculture remained significant in county economics, nonagricultural income, primarily
at the educational and training facilities, played an even larger role. The 1979 per capita
income of $6,009, however, remained well below the state average of $8,778.
Since early in the century, Hays County has enjoyed a steady influx of tourists attracted
by the caves, springs, and spas of Wimberley and San Marcos. Aquarena Springs and Wonder
Caves are particularly well known. Camp Ben McCulloch, near Driftwood, was organized in
1896 as a site for reunions of the United Confederate Veterans; their descendents continue the
annual tradition. More recently, the county caught the attention of environmentalists. Ezell
Cave, a watery cavern in San Marcos, is the habitat of several rare animal species, including
the Texas blind salamander, and 6 of the 10 known varieties of aquatic cave fauna are found
only in this cave and its underground waters. The only known habitat of the San Marcos
salamander is San Marcos Springs, and 2 other unique fish of the springs, the fountain darter
16

and San Marcos gambusia, were classed as endangered in 1990. Also on the endangered list
is Texas wild rice, which is not known to exist outside a small area near the springs.
During the 1970s and 1980s, growth in the northern and eastern parts of the county was
influenced by the expanding Austin metropolitan area and the Austin-San Antonio urban strip
along Interstate Highway 35. In 1973, Hays County became part of the Austin Metropolitan
Statistical Area. In addition to the county seat, San Marcos, which had a population of 28,743 in
1990, other county population centers are Wimberley (2,403), Kyle (2,225), Buda (1,795),
Dripping Springs (1,033), and Hays (252).
The City of Dripping Springs, in which the project area is located, emerged as a
community center before the Civil War. The first settler in the area is thought to have been a
man named Fawcett, who arrived about 1849. Other families began farming the valleys of Little
Barton and Onion creeks in the early 1850s, and, in 1857, Dripping Springs opened what
became a permanent post office. By 1884, the town supported several businesses, including a
steam gristmill and a cotton gin, and a population of 130 people. Education was provided by a
public school and by the Dripping Springs Academy, which opened in 1881. The settlement’s
location on the Austin to Fredericksburg road made it a durable community center, and, despite
a population decline during the Great Depression, Dripping Springs developed into the principal
town in northern Hays County during the 20th century. With only minor fluctuations, its
population has grown slowly but steadily since World War II. In the mid-1980s, it reported
20 businesses and more than 600 residents. By 1990, its population had risen to over 1,000.

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resource survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record cultural resources occurring within the designated project area
2. To provide a preliminary assessment of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for designation as Texas State Archeological Landmarks (SALs)
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) online Texas Historic Sites Atlas, the National
Park Service’s (NPS’s) online National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), and the Texas State Historical Association’s and
the General Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin’s The Handbook of Texas Online, as
well as a program of intensive pedestrian survey of the APE. The assessments of significance,
evaluations of SAL eligibility, and recommendations concerning the treatment options for the
cultural resources recorded during this survey are presented in Chapter 5.0, Results of
Investigations, and Chapter 6.0, Summary and Recommendations. The rest of this chapter
presents the results of archival research, the methodological background for the current
investigations, and the specific survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing information on file at the
THC and TARL for information on previously recorded cultural resource sites and previous
archeological investigations conducted within a 1.6-km (1.0-mi) radius of the project area.
Based on this research, at least 4 previous cultural resource surveys have been conducted (not
including Horizon’s prior 2005 survey of the original design of the current project area [Owens
2005]) and 3 archeological sites have been recorded within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the project area.
Two of the previous cultural resource surveys abut portions of the current project area, but the
current project’s APE (i.e., the 3.2 km [2.0 mi] of proposed reroutes) does not appear to have
been previously surveyed for cultural resources. Of the 3 previously recorded sites, 1 site is an

HJN 050073.002 AR

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

aboriginal (i.e., prehistoric to protohistoric) campsite (41HY203), 1 is a multiple-component site
consisting of an aboriginal campsite and a late 19th- to early 20th-century house (41HY198),
and 1 site file contains no information.
One historic property listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is
present in the vicinity of the project area. This property, the Joseph M. and Sarah Pound
Farmstead, known locally as the Pound House, is located in downtown Dripping Springs near
the northeast corner of the intersection of RR 12 and US 290. This historic building, now the
site of the Pound House Museum, was built by Dr. J.M. Pound in 1852. Dr. Pound, the first
doctor in Hays County, served in the Mexican and Civil wars, and 4 generations of his family
lived in the home. The Pound family operated the farm for more than 130 years, and the home
served as a hospital and a church before being donated to the city as a museum. Restoring the
home has been an ongoing community project, and is now in its 8th year.
In addition, Phillips Cemetery is located at the northwest corner of the intersection of
RR 150 and RR 12, abutting an existing roadway where a segment of wastewater pipeline is
proposed for installation on the opposite side of the road. Two smaller historic cemeteries are
located approximately 1.0 km (0.6 mi) east of downtown Dripping Springs south of US 290. No
documented cultural resource investigations appear to have been conducted at these
cemeteries, and they have not been listed on the NRHP, designated as SALs, or recorded as
archeological sites.
In Central Texas, aboriginal archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and
alluvial terraces near stream/river channels and springs. While only a few previously
documented archeological sites occur in the vicinity of the project area, only a small portion of
the landscape near Dripping Springs has been systematically surveyed for cultural resources.
Other things being equal, the proximity of the project area to Onion Creek, Walnut Springs,
Dripping Springs, and numerous tributaries of Onion Creek would tend to suggest that the
project area has a higher potential to contain potentially significant cultural resources. The
vicinity of Dripping Springs, however, has experienced rather extensive urban development, and
the existing road rights-of-way along which the proposed wastewater pipelines are to be
installed, as well as any adjoining easements that may be acquired to accommodate pipeline
installation, have been previously impacted by the construction of the roads, ditches, utility lines,
driveways, and commercial and residential development. The proposed WWTP facility is
currently a tall-grass pasture and does not appear to have been as extensively impacted as the
proposed pipeline routes; nevertheless, it is possible that some rural landscaping has been
undertaken on this property to clear the field of large rocks and to level it for pasturage.

4.2

SURVEY METHODS

The scope of work implemented during the cultural resource survey of the Dripping
Springs Wastewater System reroutes consisted of a program of intensive pedestrian survey,
including surface inspection and manual shovel test excavations. On 16 May 2007, Horizon
archeologists Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema, under the direction of Jeffrey D. Owens,
Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resource survey of the previously
unsurveyed 3.2 km (2.0 mi) of proposed pipeline reroutes to locate any cultural resource

20

properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed construction project. As the
remainder of the overall Dripping Springs Wastewater Treatment System project area had been
previously surveyed for cultural resources (Owens 2005) and cleared by the THC, survey
activities were focused exclusively on the proposed reroutes.
Horizon performed the survey of the proposed reroutes per the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) and guidelines established by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA). For linear surveys, the TSMASS calls for traversal of transect intervals
spaced no more than 30 m (98 ft) apart and excavation of shovel tests at a minimum density of
10 shovel tests per kilometer, or 16 shovel tests per mile. Thus, a minimum of 42 shovel tests
would be required for the 3.2-km- (2.0-mi-) long by 40-m- (130-ft-) wide APE whenever ground
surface visibility is obscured or otherwise poor unless field conditions warrant excavation of
more (e.g., due to the presence of culturally sensitive areas or archeological sites) or less (e.g.,
due to extensive prior disturbances or the presence of cultural low-probability areas) subsurface
probes.
Horizon’s archeologists traversed the APE in parallel transects spaced 30 m (98 ft)
apart, providing 100% survey coverage. The modern ground surface was thoroughly inspected
for historic and prehistoric cultural resources, and scattered erosional features were carefully
examined to obtain information on local stratigraphy and to identify any exposed cultural
resources. The APE traversed largely undeveloped pastureland, and the modern ground
surface was covered in thick vegetative growth of short and tall grasses at the time of the
survey, thereby reducing ground surface visibility to below 30% in most areas (Figures 2 and 3).
Consequently, systematic shovel testing was conducted within the APE to determine whether or
not cultural resources were present.
A total of 43 shovel tests were excavated in the APE, including 21 in the northern, 2.1km- (1.3-mi-) long segment of the APE and 22 in the southern, 1.1-km- (0.7-mi-) long segment
(Figures 4 and 5); the TSMASS requirements were met or exceeded for a project area of this
length. Shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm) in diameter and were excavated to a
target depth of 1.0 m (3.3 ft) below ground surface, to the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or to
the maximum depth practicable. In practice, shovel tests were terminated at depths ranging
from 20 to 50 cm below surface (cmbs) due to the relatively shallow nature of surface sediments
and the proximity of bedrock and soil parent materials (e.g., limestone and marl) to the surface.
The surficial sediments consist of relatively dense clay and clay loam, and dense gravel
deposits occurred immediately underlying the surface stratum. All sediments were screened
through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch [in]) hardware cloth.
Backhoe trenching was not conducted during this survey as no areas with moderate to
high probabilities for cultural materials at depths exceeding 1.0 m (3.3 ft) below surface (i.e.,
deeper than shovel testing would be capable of detecting) were identified. The southern portion
of the APE is situated adjacent to Onion Creek, but this stretch of Onion Creek consists of a
relatively deeply incised stream channel, and floodplains and terrace environments composed
of deep alluvial packages are lacking within the project area.

This survey set out to employ a non-collection policy for cultural materials. Nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were to be
described, sketched, and/or photodocumented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. In the event that any diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points,
ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) were identified in the field, they were to be
collected and placed in resealable plastic bags labeled with relevant provenience information.
Cultural resources encountered during the survey were photodocumented; notes were recorded
on the nature, variety, and provenience of cultural resources; and the materials were replaced
where they were found.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new archeological site (41HY434), an
aboriginal campsite and lithic raw material procurement locality (i.e., “quarry”) consisting of a
surface scatter of chipped stone tools (primarily late-stage bifaces), chert cores, lithic debitage,
and burned rock. No isolated occurrences of artifacts or historic-age structures were
encountered.
In addition to the archeological site, the Phillips Cemetery, a historic-age cemetery, is
located on the west side of RR 12 just north of the intersection of RR 12 and RR 150. The
proposed pipeline would be installed within the existing right-of-way of RR 12 on the east side of
the existing pavement (i.e., on the opposite side of the road from the cemetery). While the
proposed undertaking would not result in any impacts to the Phillips Cemetery, the existing
right-of-way on the west side of RR 12 (i.e., in front of the Phillips Cemetery) was surveyed in
the interest of verifying that no undocumented remains associated within the cemetery exist
within the existing right-of-way.

5.1

SITE 41HY434

Site 41HY434 is a moderate- to high-density scatter of aboriginal artifacts situated in an
open, short-grass pasture at the eastern margin of a broad terrace of Onion Creek (Figures 6
and 7). Based on distributions of artifacts on the modern ground surface and in 1 positive
shovel test, the site extends 350 m north to south by 250 m east to west. The site was fully
delineated north to south, though the eastern and western boundaries were not completely
defined during the survey. North-to-south-running gravel driveways roughly define the eastern
and western edges of the site as currently defined, though it is not known if the site continues
farther in those directions. An unnamed tributary of Onion Creek flows southward at a distance
of approximately 400 m west of the site, and Onion Creek itself flows southeastward
approximately 600 m west of the site. Topographically, the site is relatively level, sloping very
gently down toward the southwest at elevations ranging from 323 to 326 m (1,060 to 1,070 ft)
amsl.
Artifacts observed on the modern ground surface include abundant chipped stone cores,
lithic debitage, and large, early-stage bifaces (Figures 8 and 9), as well as some burned
limestone rocks and burned chert cobbles. All observed chipped stone artifacts appear to have
been manufactured from locally available Edwards chert, and an exposure of chert-bearing

limestone gravels is present in a bedrock formation exposed on the modern ground surface a
short distance north of the site. In addition to cores and lithic debitage, several early-stage
bifaces and biface fragments were observed. The primary aboriginal activity on site 41HY434
would appear to have been focused on lithic raw material procurement and the early stages of
core reduction and bifacial tool production. No cultural features were observed, though the
presence of a relatively small number of burned limestone rocks and burned chert cobbles
attests to the possibility that features may once have been present on the site.
Surface artifact densities are moderate to high across the site, ranging from as low as
1 artifact per 50 m2 near the documented site boundaries to as high as 5 artifacts per 10 m2
near the site center. The gradient from lower to higher surface artifact densities appears to be
gradual, and no recognizable areas of markedly higher densities (e.g., “activity areas”) were
identified. No diagnostic artifacts were observed on the site, though the preponderance of
large, early-stage bifaces may suggest an Archaic period association for at least some of the
cultural materials, though this cannot be conclusively demonstrated in the absence of datable
organic remains or temporally diagnostic artifacts.
A total of 7 shovel tests (STs JW-22 to 24 and MM-19 to 22) were excavated on site
41WM434 (see Figure 6). Hard, gravelly dark brown to black clay loam was encountered to the
bottom of the shovel tests at depths ranging from 15 to 20 cmbs. Shovel tests were terminated
at 15 to 20 cmbs due to the presence of dense, marly clay underlying the shallow surface
sediments that could not be penetrated with hand tools. Shovel tests appear to have fully
penetrated Holocene sediments with the potential to contain cultural resources. Only 1 of the
7 shovel tests excavated on the site yielded subsurface cultural materials. ST MM-22,

Cultural Resources Survey of 2.4 Miles of Proposed Pipeline Reroutes

excavated in the approximate center of the documented site area, contained 1 flake recovered
from depths of 0 to 20 cmbs; however, given the overall surficial character of the site, it is likely
that this single artifact has been translocated from the surface and does not attest to the
presence of subsurface archeological deposits.
Site 41HY434 consists of a moderate- to high-density scatter of aboriginal artifacts
largely confined to the modern ground surface of an open pasture at the junction of the clayey
and marly eastern terrace of Onion Creek and the adjacent uplands. One of 7 shovel tests
excavated on the site produced an artifact from subsurface contexts; however, the site contains
only shallow, gravelly clayey sediments measuring only 15 to 20 cmin depth overlying marly
clay subsoil. While the preponderance of chert cores, lithic debitage, and large, early-stage
bifaces suggests that the primary function of the aboriginal occupation of site 41HY434 was
lithic raw material procurements (i.e., “quarrying”) from nearby chert-bearing gravel exposures,
the presence of occasional fragments of burned rock and fire-reddened chert cobbles suggests
that cultural features, such as hearths or chert heat-treating facilities, related to more
generalized campsite-related activities may also have once been present on the site. While the
variety and density of artifact types on the site attests to aboriginal activity on the site, the lack
of diagnostic artifacts precludes pinpointing the age or cultural affiliation of the aboriginal
occupation (aside from a possible Archaic association suggested by the predominance of large,
early stage bifaces). Furthermore, observed cultural materials are confined largely to the
modern ground surface of a pasture that has apparently experienced some degree of erosion
and deflation as a result of historic land use practices and lack integrity. The presence of small
quantities of burned rock suggests that cultural features may once have been present on the
site, but any such features appear to have been disturbed by prior erosional and agricultural
activities and are no longer extant. Due to the surficial context, lack of diagnostic artifacts, lack
of organic remains, and lack of integrity resulting from prior disturbances to the site, the
investigated area of site 41HY434 does not appear to possess significant potential to contribute
to an enhanced understanding of the prehistoric past under Criterion D of the NRHP, and the
site does not possess characteristics warranting eligibility under Criteria A, B, or C. While
undocumented areas of site 41HY434 may be present east and west of the documented site
boundaries, the investigated portion of the site is recommended as ineligible for designation as
an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on site 41HY434 in connection with the
Dripping Springs Wastewater Treatment System project.

5.2

PHILLIPS CEMETERY

The Phillips Cemetery is located on the west side of RR 12 just north of the intersection
of RR 12 and RR 150 on the south side of Dripping Springs (Figures 10 and 11). The
boundaries of the cemetery are clearly marked with barbed-wire fencing, and a line of large oak
trees is situated within the existing RR 12 right-of-way on the west side of the road between the
pavement and the cemetery fence, suggesting that the marked cemetery boundaries have
remained stable for quite some time. The proposed Dripping Springs Wastewater System
pipeline would be installed within the existing RR 12 right-of-way on the east side of the road
(i.e., on the opposite side of the road from the cemetery) and would not result in any potential
impacts to the cemetery. While the proposed undertaking would not result in any impacts to the

Phillips Cemetery, the existing right-of-way on the west side of RR 12 (i.e., in front of the Phillips
Cemetery) was surveyed in the interest of verifying that no undocumented remains associated
within the cemetery exist within the existing right-of-way. A transect of 5 shovel tests was
excavated between the existing roadway and the cemetery fence-line to assess the potential for
unmarked burials within the existing RR 12 right-of-way. Sediments consisted of gravelly, black
silty clay loam mixed with road gravels extending to depths of 20 to 40 cmbs, at which point the
sediments gave way to dense, marly clay subsoil characteristic of the area. The existing rightof-way of RR 12 is considered to have no potential to contain any unmarked remains associated
with the Phillips Cemetery.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination
of whether or not an archeological site possesses the potential to make a contribution to 1 or
more previously defined research questions. Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey
level are rarely sufficient to contribute in a meaningful manner to such research issues. The
objectives are, first, to locate and delineate site boundaries with the project’s APE and, second,
to determine which archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance
of regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Thus, adequate information on
site function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate,
historical perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions
vary as a function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and
chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the
inventory process.

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resource properties are a function
of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Cultural
resources are usually evaluated according to criteria established to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP. Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the
criteria presented in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The

HJN 050073.002 AR

35

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

4 criteria of eligibility are applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and
related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history (U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service (36 CFR
§60.4).

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For a cultural resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

6.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:

36

050073-002_arch_survey_report.docx

Cultural Resources Survey of 2.4 Miles of Proposed Pipeline Reroutes
Dripping Springs Wastewater Treatment System Project, Dripping Springs, Hays County, Texas

Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
structure as an SAL if it (1) is publicly or privately owned and listed on the NRHP and (2) meets
one of the following 6 eligibility criteria:
A. Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history;
B. Is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. Is important to a particular cultural or ethnic group;
D. Is the work of a significant architect, master builder, or craftsman;
E. Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,
possesses high aesthetic value, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinctions; or
F. Has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to the understanding of
Texas culture or history.

undocumented areas of site 41HY434 may be present east and west of the documented site
boundaries, the investigated portion of the site is recommended as ineligible for designation as
an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on site 41HY434 in connection with the
Dripping Springs Wastewater Treatment System project.
In addition to the archeological site, the Phillips Cemetery, a historic-age cemetery, is
located on the west side of RR 12 just north of the intersection of RR 12 and RR 150. The
proposed pipeline would be installed within the existing right-of-way of RR 12 on the east side of
the existing pavement (i.e., on the opposite side of the road from the cemetery). While the
proposed undertaking would not result in any impacts to the Phillips Cemetery, the existing
right-of-way on the west side of RR 12 (i.e., in front of the Phillips Cemetery) was surveyed in
the interest of verifying that no undocumented remains associated within the cemetery exist
within the existing right-of-way. The survey confirmed that no previously undocumented
remains associated with the Phillips Cemetery would be impacted by proposed construction.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations of the Dripping Springs
Wastewater System project area documented in this report, no potentially significant cultural
resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. One new archeological site,
41HY434, was recorded during the survey, but this site does not possess characteristics
warranting eligibility for designation as an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on
site 41HY434. Furthermore, the proposed undertaking, as designed, would not result in any
impacts to the Phillips Cemetery.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural resources were identified that meet
the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as SALs
according to 13 TAC 26.12, no further archeological work is recommended in connection with
the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the proposed project be cleared to proceed.
However, in the unlikely event that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the THC should be
notified of the discovery.
