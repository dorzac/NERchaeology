ABSTRACT
AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a cultural resource investigation of the proposed
Riverby Ranch Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) impact areas in northeast Fannin
County for North Texas Municipal Water District. The 14,959-acre ranch is to serve
as mitigation land associated with the planned construction of the Lower Bois d’Arc
Creek Reservoir. Of the total 14,959 acres, 2,738 are registered in the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resource Conservation Service WRP. The
WRP acreage consists entirely of the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain through the
property down to its confluence with the Red River. Prior to enrollment in the WRP
in 2005, a private landowner of Riverby Ranch, excavated numerous shallow ponds
and built a dike along the outermost margin of the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain to
facilitate water retention and the development of wetlands and bird habitat. These
dikes redirect tributaries that once fed into Bois d’Arc Creek. Previously no work
inside the WRP had been anticipated, however, in order to finalize the Mitigation
Plan, some work is now being proposed. Impacts will only occur in specific areas.
There are two types of activities being proposed. The first is the breaching of the
man-made dikes where drainages have been cut off from Bois d’Arc Creek. There
are 11 dike breach locations where the sediments will be excavated allowing the
drainage to go back to its natural flow. Work proposed in the immediate vicinity of
these locations will involve excavating dike material and placing it on the outside
of the dike (i.e., not toward the inside of the WRP) in the adjacent ditch using a
mechanical excavator. Material will then be compacted in place by a bulldozer or
the excavator. These work areas will be a 200 ft2 (approximately 0.92 acres each)
and are focused on the breach points. The second activity will be the planting of
tree seedlings along five drainage channels in the WRP for the riparian buffer areas.
Seedlings will be planted inside 50 ft wide corridors on either side of the drainage
channels. These combined survey areas total of 36.71 acres and were systematically
surveyed in October 2017. The three prehistoric sites (41FN260, 41FN261, and
41FN262) were found in areas near where previously recorded sites had been
documented. None of them contained preserved organics or diagnostic artifacts and
all are recommended as not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places or as State Antiquities Landmarks. Based on the results of the survey, AR
Consultants, Inc. concludes that further cultural resource investigations for this
project area are unwarranted. All artifacts and paperwork will be curated at Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas in Austin.

INTRODUCTION
North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) is planning to construct the Lower Bois d’Arc
Creek Reservoir (LBCR) northeast of Bonham, Texas in east central Fannin County. The reservoir
will inundate 16,526 acres of the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain and terraces. NTMWD is working
with Freese and Nichols, Inc. (FNI) on the proposed Mitigation Plan for the project. That document
details the design, engineering, and hydrological restoration of the LBCR’s mitigation property,
Riverby Ranch (Figure 1). In order to complete the Mitigation Plan, an archaeological survey was
conducted to document all known cultural resources, as well as record any undocumented
archaeological sites in the identified high potential areas (HPAs), so that information could be used
for planning and design purposes (Davis et al. 2016). The Riverby Ranch property extends south
from the Red River, down the Fannin and Lamar county line, to just northeast of Monkstown,
Texas. Of the total 14,959 acres, 2,738 are registered in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
(USDA) Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). The
WRP acreage consists entirely of the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain through the property down to
its confluence with the Red River. Prior to enrollment in the WRP in 2005, a private landowner of
Riverby Ranch, excavated numerous shallow ponds and built a dike along the outermost margin
of the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain to facilitate water retention and the development of wetlands
and bird habitat. These dikes redirect tributaries that fed into Bois d’Arc Creek along the outside
of the dike in a man-made channel that carries the water to the north and eventually reconnects
with the creek near FM 79.
Previously no work inside the WRP had been anticipated, however, in order to finalize the
Mitigation Plan, some work is now being proposed. Impacts will only occur in the areas outlined
in Figure 2. There are two types of activities being proposed. The first is the breaching of the manmade dikes where drainages have been cut off from Bois d’Arc Creek. There are 11 dike breach
(DB) locations (Figure 3) where the sediments will be excavated allowing the drainage to go back
to its natural flow. Work proposed in the immediate vicinity of these locations will involve
excavating dike material and placing it on the outside of the dike (i.e., not toward the inside of the
WRP) in the adjacent ditch using a mechanical excavator. Material will then be compacted in place
by a bulldozer or the excavator. These work areas will be a 200 ft2 (approximately 0.92 acres each
for a total of 10.1 total acres) and are focused on the breach points. The staging areas for all this
work will also be confined to these work areas. All excavated material will be disposed of within
the work areas adjacent to, and outside, the dike.
The second activity will be the planting of tree seedlings along five drainage channels in the WRP
for the creation of riparian (RP) buffer areas. Seedlings will be planted inside 50 ft wide corridors
on either side of the drainage channels. These areas total 26.61 acres. There are a few types of
work currently proposed to restore these riparian corridors and they include: mowing/shredding of
existing vegetation within corridor; application of herbicide to existing vegetation; seedbed
preparation that would involve disking/chiseling the top 8 inches (20 cm) of soil; hand and/or
machine planting of one-year old containerized tree seedlings within the top 6 inches (15 cm) of
soil. It is anticipated that all work, excluding hand planting of seedlings, could involve the use of
a wheeled and/or track-type tractor. Machine planters for planting seedlings typically have a
coulter (slicing through the soil), a foot (pulling the machine below surface level), trencher plates
(opening the soil for seedling placement) and packing wheels to close and compress the soil.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE LBCR RIVERBY RANCH WRP IMPACT AREAS

AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) prepared a comprehensive research design (Skinner et al. 2010) that
provided a foundation for fieldwork and laboratory analysis done in conjunction with
archaeological investigations for the overall LBCR project. Additionally, a Programmatic
Agreement (PA) was developed for the project in which the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, USACE,
THC, and NTMWD are the signatories. The intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of Riverby
Ranch was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit (TAP) 6887. Survey of the proposed
reservoir portion of the project was done under TAP 5950 (Davis et al. 2014) and the associated
water treatment plant, pipeline, and other components were surveyed under TAP 6626 (Davis et
al. 2013). Because reservoir construction will affect Waters of the U.S., the project requires the
Tulsa District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to issue an individual 404 permit,
which was issued in February 2018. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of
1969 (PL-90-190), the Clean Water Act, as amended (PL-92-500), the Archeological and
Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593
“Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,” and Protection of Historic Properties
(36 CFR 800). The Texas Antiquities Code (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191)
also applies to the cultural resource investigations for the overall LBCR project since NTMWD is
an entity of the state of Texas.
ARC conducted a two-part intensive pedestrian survey of the HPAs at Riverby Ranch exclusive
of the WRP (Davis et al. 2016). The first phase of this project included extensive archival research
on the history of Riverby Ranch, as well as the collection of oral history interviews. In addition to
this research, all 20 previously recorded archaeological sites (8 prehistoric, 5 historic, and 7
multicomponent) on the property were researched and revisited when possible. ARC revisited 13
of these sites in 2014. The second phase, an intensive pedestrian survey of 3,670 acres of HPAs,
was conducted in 2015. In addition to that archaeological survey, ARC compiled additional
archival research on the various parcels of land and collected additional oral histories on the project
area. To gain a better perspective of the topography and geomorphology, ARC partnered with FNI
to conduct a geomorphic analysis of the property. Sixty-seven new archaeological sites (12
prehistoric, 50 historic, and 5 multicomponent) were recorded during that 2nd survey phase. The
results of the Riverby Ranch survey demonstrated that archaeological sites were typically found
above the 450’ above mean sea level (amsl) contour, given the property’s propensity to easily flood
and hold water below this elevation. However, most sites were found above the 460’ contour.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) (Council of Texas Archeologists 2018). The following report
presents a brief description of the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of
the culture history and previous investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research
design and methodology employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field
investigation and conclusions. The report concludes with recommendations followed by the
references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Riverby Ranch is situated on the south bank of the Red River just east of its confluence with the
Blue River, which drains the eastern side of the Arbuckle Mountains in Oklahoma. The Bureau of
Economic Geology ([BEG] 1966) mapped the Red River floodplain as being filled with
Quaternary-aged alluvium (Qal) that extends up to the 450’ amsl contour. Then between 450’ and
460’ amsl contours, a Quaternary-aged 1st (Qt 1) fluviatile terrace deposit extends along the south
side of the floodplain then follows the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain to the southwest (BEG 1966).
This Qt 1 is described as containing mostly sand, silt, and some clay that is well bedded and ranges
from red to tan in color. Most of the remainder of the property above 460’ amsl contour is mapped
as a Qt 2 terrace deposit. This terrace deposit is described as containing gravel, sand, silt, and some
silty clay with well-sorted basal gravel. In the far southeast portion of the property the BEG maps
Cretaceous-aged Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) near 500’ amsl contour. This formation is shale with
thin platy beds of sandstone and sandy limestone. The remainder of this area above 550’ amsl
contour is shown as Qt 4, which is comprised of gravel, sand, and silt.
According to the USDA, Riverby Ranch is comprised of four different general soil associations
(Goerdel 2001:General Soils Map). The floodplain and Qt 1 terraces belong to the Seven-BelkRedlake and Tinn soil associations. The Tinn series is described as very deep, nearly level clayey
soils (Goerdel 2001:24). The Seven-Belk-Redlake series is similar to Tinn, but contains some
loamy and clayey soils (Goerdel 2001:24). Most of the Qt 2 deposits belong to the Ferris soil
association, which consists of very deep, very gently to strongly sloping clayey soils with moderate
alkalinity (Goerdel 2001:17). The fourth association is found on the southeast portion of the
property and consists of the Whakana-Porum-Freestone soils. These soils are very deep, nearly
level to strongly sloping soils that range from strongly acidic to neutral (Goerdel 2001:18). Specific
soils on the property are listed in Table 1 and shown by setting on Figure 4.

Figure 4.

Floodplain and terrace soils at Riverby Ranch (USDA 2014).

Riverby Ranch falls within three Microenvironmental Zones as defined in the LBCR Research
Design (Skinner et al. 2010:8). Zone 5 is comprised of the younger terrace sediments deposited by
the Red River. Zone 6 is the Red River and its active floodplain, where giant cane is abundant.
These two zones were forest-covered with a grass understory prior to historic clearing for
agricultural purposes. Zone 4 is the level upland prairie composed of Qt 4 terrace sediments,
deposited by the Red River. In addition to the Red River, Bois d’Arc Creek flows through the
eastern part of the ranch. There are three other named tributaries on the property, Ragsdale Branch,
Willow Branch, and Black Branch. Ragsdale Branch is in the far western portion of the property,
while Willow Branch flows through the central portion of the ranch into the Red River. Black
Branch flows to the northeast in the southern part of the ranch into Bois d’Arc Creek.
Additionally, the geoarchaeological potential of the property was assessed during a previous
investigation for the Gulf Crossing Pipeline Project (Hajic and Mandel 2009; Mandel 2009). Initial
geoarchaeological reconnaissance of the pipeline project through the property stated that the Bois
d’Arc River valley was unlikely to yield buried cultural deposits as the stream was unstable and
had experienced rapid sedimentation (Mandel 2009:2). However, the Red River valley was
recommended for testing. The results of that work are summarized in the Hajic and Mandel report
(2009). The authors analyzed sediments collected from three geologic cores on the property as
well as high altitude color infrared aerial photography, historic topographic maps, and historic and

recent aerial photographs to determine the archaeological potential of the Red River on Riverby
Ranch (Hajic and Mandel 2009:1). Using this information, the authors mapped the geomorphology
of the Red River in more detail than the BEG and concluded that there was low to moderate
potential for buried prehistoric sites only on the T2 terrace (Hajic and Mandel 2009:8). The authors
also stated that T4 would likely only contain surface sites and that the small floodplain bench (Fb)
near the bend of the Red River, could have potential for buried sites in the top 80 centimeters
below the surface ([cmbs] Hajic and Mandel 2009:3-5).
The geomorphological investigations conducted during ARC’s Riverby Ranch survey (TAP 6887)
identified nine distinct morphostratigraphic units present on Riverby Ranch (Figure 5). These
surfaces include: the Kansan Alluvial Terrace, the early-Wisconsinan Ambrose Alluvial Terrace,
the late-Wisconsinan Cooke Alluvial Terrace, the Cooke Floodplain depression and Wetland
Complex, the Holocene Denison Alluvial Terrace, Historic Terrace and Levee deposits, Historic
Point Bar, and the Present Day Floodplain (Bois d’Arc Creek and Red River) (Davis et al. 2016:
126). Of these, the two most pertinent to the current discussion are the Denison Terrace and the
Cooke Terrace. Climate shifts and the construction of the Denison Dam have stabilized the location
and fluvial activity of the Red River. Based on the present study’s geomorphic assessment of
Riverby Ranch, the Denison Terrace represents the active Red River floodplain until the early20th century. The Cooke Terrace would have been the nearest inhabitable surface. ARC
concentrated field efforts this area, and geomorphic sampling and recorded sites did not have any
buried soil horizons. Evidence from these and previous investigations confirmed that human
occupation was confined to the top one to two meters of sediment (Davis et al. 2016: 421).
Currently additional geomorphological work is being proposed in the Cooke and Denison terraces.
In a broad sense, a single major climax vegetation community can be found adjacent to the study
area, as defined by Küchler (1964); the Southern Floodplain Forest fills the Red River floodplain
and extends to the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain. The southern part of the ranch overlaps with the
Oak-Hickory Forest on the Red River terraces on both sides of the river upstream and downstream
from its confluence with Bois d’Arc Creek (Küchler 1964). Diamond et al. (1987:Figure 1) show
the ranch is in the Oak Woods and Prairies, while Diggs et al. (2006:Figure 2) map it as the Post
Oak Savanna. These classifications are larger more general groupings, whereas the Ecoregions as
shown by Griffith et al. (2007:Figure 2) show that the ranch is comprised of three distinct
ecological settings. The Northern Post Oak Savanna (33a) that comprises the southeastern portion
of the ranch consists of deciduous forest of a blackjack and post oaks, red cedars, and black
hickories with yaupon understory and little bluestem grasses in the prairies (Griffith et al.
2007:66). The Pleistocene Fluvial Terraces (35c) are made up of unconsolidated terrace deposits
that are periodically wet (Griffith et al. 2007:90). Vegetation in this area is typically comprised of
pine-hardwood forests with loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, post oak, Shumard oak, red oak, water
oak, willow oak, and sweetgum. The Red River Bottomlands (35g) consists of similar vegetation
to the other two regions but focused on the floodplain and low terraces of the Red River (Griffith
et al. 2007:93). All of the forested areas produced nuts that were available to humans, including
acorns that were foraged by forest-dwelling mammals. It appears from the research of Jurney
(1994), Flores (1984, 1985), and Schambach (1995) that bois d’arc trees (Burton 1973) were
historically abundant in the creek valley; this may have been the case for hundreds or thousands
of years (Smith and Perino 1981; Winberry 1979).

Historically, deer, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, squirrels, skunks, beavers, minks, muskrats, and
others, inhabited the forested terraces, while rabbits, antelope, and bison lived in the upland
prairies (Blair 1950). The river and creeks were home to fish, turtles, frogs, snakes, mussels, and
crayfish. Ducks made their homes in the sloughs and flowing channels, while an abundance of
other bird species inhabited the forests permanently or during yearly migrations. The Fannin
County climate is warm and humid with hot summers and moderate winter temperatures. Rainfall
averages 43.99 inches (in) annually with monthly precipitation ranging from 2.02 in (January) to
6.06 in (May). High rainfall occurs in the spring and fall.

Prehistoric Occupation
The earliest Native American occupation seems to have occurred in Fannin County was during the
early Paleoindian period when fluted Clovis dart points were being made. Dozens and maybe
hundreds of Clovis points have been collected from the North Sulphur River channel in the
southern part of the county but only one has been documented (Bever and Meltzer 2007:Table 1;
Carley 1986; Todd and Skinner 2007; Jennings 2008; Davis et al. 2014). Virtually all these Clovis
points were made from exotic cherts that occur elsewhere in Texas and Oklahoma. None of these
finds came from well-dated geologic contexts. The only geological profile in the county that
extends to pre-Clovis time is from the bank of the North Sulphur River at Ralph Hall Reservoir
(Skinner et al. 2005; Bousman and Skinner 2007). This profile was collected on a 9.5 m deep river
bank where 17 distinct zones were described, and three radiocarbon dates collected (Skinner et al.
2005:29; Bousman and Skinner 2007:42). The first sample came from near the bottom of Unit 3
and was dated to 10,860±140 B.P. (7.1 m below the surface). The second sample was from the top
of Unit 4 (7.2 m below the surface) and was dated to 15,510±330 B.P., while a sample from the
bottom of the unit dated 17,470±330 B.P (9.25 m below the surface). Additionally, a cobble core
found on the face of the adjacent riverbank could possibly date to the time of Clovis or earlier
(Skinner et al. 2005:29; Bousman and Skinner 2007:42). Excavations at the North Central Texas
Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479) demonstrated that Clovis people were hunting a wide array of large
and small mammals as well as utilizing raw material for lithics from sources more than 200
kilometers (km) away (Ferring 2001). In addition to early point types, such as Clovis and Folsom,
later styles including San Patrice, Dalton, and Plainview have been found in the area (Story
1990:177-211; Johnson 1989; Jennings 2008). It is apparent that the surrounding area was visited
or occupied during the Paleoindian period, but evidence of undisturbed campsites has not been
found. The low density sites and the abundance of exotic chert artifacts found in the drainage

channels of the North Sulphur River indicate that Paleoindian people were nomadic hunters and
gatherers (Mahoney 2001:8) who came to Fannin County on a periodic basis for the purpose of
acquiring specific resources or spending the winter in an environment that was protected from the
harsh winters on the high plains (Skinner et al. 2005:62-63). They may have come as “ridge
runners” (Hofman 1988; Thurmond and Wyckoff 1999:245-246) but evidence of such a mode of
transportation has not been thoroughly documented in Northeastern Texas. The transition from the
Paleoindian period to the Archaic has recently been discussed as a series of economic, settlement,
technological, and social changes that can be termed the “ProtoArchaic” (Bousman and Oksanen
2012:224).”
During the Archaic, which is divided into Early, Middle, and Late periods, groups continued to
live as mobile hunting and gathering bands (Perttula 2016). In the Early Archaic, group territories
have not been defined, though they might be determined by analysis of lithic artifact source
locations. Sites dating to this period were briefly and seasonally occupied; they are represented by
lithic scatters, some of which were found at repeatedly visited locations. Burned rock features
occur at Middle Archaic sites where plant cooking was more common. In the southern part of the
county, Middle Archaic people harvested mussels from the North Sulphur River channel (Skinner
et al. 2005:47-48). Mussel shells were found at several prehistoric sites along upper Bois d’Arc
Creek (Hsu 1968:10-17) as well as in the LBCR study area (Davis et al. 2014:211). In the Late
Archaic, increased population density limited group mobility, causing groups to settle into
restricted territories and to use locally available lithic sources for chipped stone tools (Perttula
1998:18).
During the Woodland period, a sedentary lifestyle is indicated by the presence of circular and
rectangular houses; undecorated thick-walled-grog tempered Williams Plain pottery, and increased
amounts of native plant foods. Fourche Maline ceramics traditions, like Williams Plain, are known
for their plain and minimally decorated vessels (Ellis 2013:139). The vessels are typically thickwalled, flowerpot shaped jars and bowls with flat disc-shaped bases (Schambach 1998:81-82,
Schambach 2002:91-93, Dockall et al. 2008:22, Ellis 2013:139). These ceramics are typically
tempered with a variety of materials including clay/grog, bone, grit, and/or sand (Schambach
1998:81-82, Ellis 2013:139) Schambach (1998:25) concluded in his report on the Cooper site in
Arkansas, that 9 millimeters (mm) was the mode thickness for Williams Plain ceramics. He went
on to state that the mode thickness was 7 to 8 mm in the larger collection from the Means site
(Schambach 1998:82). Ellis (2013:139) states that the thickness is highly variable, but average 12
mm.
While Gary dart points were used concurrently with arrow points during the Woodland period,
arrow points would eventually replace the dart point (Perttula 2004:376). During excavations at
the Gene and Ruth Ann Stallings site (41LR297), north of Paris in Lamar County, numerous
postholes were uncovered, which possibly represent a rectangular house 80 ft long and more than
20 ft wide (Skinner 2007, 2012). A house with a similar pattern and size was uncovered at the
Poole site (3GA3) in southwestern Arkansas (Wood 1981). If the postholes at 41LR297 represent
a rectangular house, the Stallings site and the Poole site would be the only known examples of
rectangular Fourche Maline houses. Coles Creek pottery and associated chipped stone artifacts
appeared after A.D. 600. Prehistoric Native Americans at this time settled into small hamlets and
camps, dispersed within recognizable territories (Perttula et al. 1993:99). These technological

changes coincided with a gradual population increase. The Ray site (41LR135) in east central
Lamar County contains a deposit that spans this period (Bruseth et al. 2001).
Formative Caddo people are first recognized about A.D. 800 and this time period lasted until
approximately A.D. 1000. Horticulture was developing but hunting and gathering continued to
provide the main foods (Mahoney 2001:10). Settlements consisted of villages, hamlets, and singlefamily dwellings. Some of the villages contained associated platform and/or burial mounds
(Perttula 2004:383). In the Early Caddo period, hunting and gathering subsistence strategies were
supplemented by the cultivation of maize, squash, and several kinds of native seeds (Perttula
2004:383; Mahoney 2001:10). The material culture was as diverse as during later Caddo times,
which includes various types of ceramics, lithic tools and arrow points, as well as axes, celts, pipes,
and various ground stone tools. The Early Caddo period marks a transition from undecorated plain
wares that dominate Woodland period assemblages to a more diversified collection of ceramics,
particularly the introduction and florescence of a relatively wide variety of decorative elements
potentially associated with different Caddo groups, including the first examples of engraved and
polished vessels (Emerson and Girard 2004:57; Perttula 2013:186). Coles Creek Incised ceramics,
which generally occur in high frequencies at Caddo sites in Northwest Louisiana and parts of
Arkansas (Kidder 1990), are relatively marginal in Early Caddo assemblages in East Texas
(Perttula 2011:70-71). Decorative types from East Texas Caddo sites include fine wares Hickory,
Holly, and Spiro Engraved, utility wares Coles Creek, Davis, Kiam, East, Crockett Curvilinear,
and Dunkin Incised, Weches Fingernail Impressed, Hollyknowe Ridge Pinched, and Crenshaw
Fluted (Perttula 2013:186). Incising is characteristic of utility ware decoration while burnishing
and post-fire engraving are the decorative techniques associated with fine wares (Perttula
2011:51). Despite the incorporation of decorative techniques in ceramic production during the
period, the majority of Early Caddo assemblages are still composed of mostly plain wares (Perttula
2011:50). Grog is the most common temper used for Early Caddo ceramics, but bone, hematite,
and ferruginous sandstone also occur, though almost exclusively in utility wares (Perttula et al
2010:23). Perttula (2015:29) notes that pre-AD 1400 assemblages with a high proportion of bone
temper (>40% of the assemblage) primarily occur at sites located in the middle Sabine River basin.
Additionally, Perttula (2011:65) describes Caddo ceramics from the Boxed Springs site (41UR30)
in Upshur County as having less than 7 mm thick walls on average and notes that this is consistent
with other Early Caddo assemblages.
Middle Caddo period sites along the middle Red River have been related to the Sanders Phase;
they include dispersed farmsteads and hamlets, along with a few large villages. The period is
characterized by single and multiple earthen mounds that contained burials, some with abundant
and exotic grave goods, indicating the presence of high status individuals (Perttula 1998:19). The
best-known site from this period and in the Red River Watershed in Texas is the T. M. Sanders
site (41LR2), which is located adjacent to the mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek. The site is located
approximately one-half mile south of the Red River and is at an elevation of approximately 450’
amsl. The site includes of two earthen mounds, one of which contained 21 graves, many with
multiple burials, with a wide variety and number of grave goods (Krieger 1946:171-218; Jackson
et al. 2000). Conch shell dippers, gorgets, and shell beads were found with burials at the site, as
well as on the plowed site surface. These correspond to artifacts attributed to the Southeastern
Ceremonial Complex, previously referred to as the Southern Death Cult (Krieger 1946:177;
Waring and Holder 1945; Hamilton 1997; Skinner et al. 1969:106).

Other exotic artifacts recovered from the site include bar gorgets (Harris 1953a), ear spools, stone
pipes, and celts. Some authors (Bruseth et al. 1995; Schambach 1999, 2000) have debated whether
this site was an outpost for the Spiro site in Oklahoma. The Sanders Phase was characterized by
exchange between groups in Northeastern Texas, the South Plains, and the Mississippian people
of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. The material for the polished Ouachita sandstone elbow
pipes could have been collected locally or may indicate trade with Oklahoma residents. Krieger
(1946:194-195) discusses that the houses appear to be four-sided with one side open. He goes on
to state that the fourth side might have been unintentionally destroyed while excavating, but at
least in one instance he was confident that the structure had three walls and one open side.
Agricultural hoes made of freshwater mussel shells and bison-scapula were found at the site
(Jackson et al. 2000:34; Krieger 1946:183-184, 194). More recent investigations at the Sanders
site indicate that it was likely occupied briefly in the Late Archaic through the Woodland period
(Perttula et al. 2015:82). The authors go on to state that the first principal ancestral Caddo
components date to the Middle Caddo (ca. A.D. 1100-1300), and the material cultural from this
period represents the Sanders Phase (Perttula et al. 2015:82). The final occupation at the site was
during the late 17th through mid-18th century, which the authors state as part of the Womack Phase
of the Historic Caddo Period (Perttula et al. 2015:82).
Perttula et al. (2016b:87) have recently identified and redefined the ceramic assemblage from the
Sanders site (41LR2) which represents the Middle Caddo Period. There are ten ceramic types, two
of which are newly defined, while another, Sanders Plain, has been redefined as Sanders Slipped
(Perttula et al. 2016b:87). Perttula et al (2016b:Table 2) lists Bois d’Arc Plain, Bois d’Arc Plain,
var. Crawford, Canton Incised, East Incised, Haley Engraved, Hickory Engraved, Maxey Noded
Redware, Monkstown Fingernail Impressed, Sanders Engraved, Sanders Incised, and Sanders
Slipped as present in the assemblage from the Sanders site. The principal types are Bois d’Arc
Plain, Sanders Engraved, Maxey Noded Redware, and Sanders Slipped. Sanders Plain was
originally defined by Brown (1996:401-403), and is described as a grog-tempered, slipped, and
undecorated type. However, this in not completely true, as the slipped element is a form of
decoration, therefore Perttula et al. (2016b:87) have renamed them Sanders Slipped. Bois d’Arc
Plain is defined as non-slipped plain grog- and/or bone-tempered wares. This new ceramic type as
a distinct class in the form of Bois d’Arc Plain, var. Crawford, where the vessels have scalloped
and cut lips (Perttula et al. 2016b:87). Sanders Incised is the last of the newly defined types, and
it refers to vessels with similar decoration as the Sanders Engraved, except that the decoration is
executed in a wet paste and not in an engraved method after the vessel was leather-hard or already
fired (Perttula et al 2016b:87).
Large platform mounds are associated with Middle Caddo times, further indicating socially
complex societies, as inferred from the Sanders site. These sites may include the Harling Mound
(41FN1) in Fannin County (Davis 1962a and b), but also include the Mackin Mound (41LR36) in
Lamar County (Mallouf 1976) and the Fasken Mound (41RR1) site in Red River County (Perttula
et al. 2001). A more recent analysis of the collections held at the TARL for the Harling Mound
demonstrate that the site was occupied during the same times as the Sanders site (Perttula
2015c:83). A Middle Caddo shaft burial was reported from the Bentsen-Clark (41RR41) site in
Red River County. According to Banks and Winters (1975:72), the artifacts associated with the

15

burial in Feature No. 1 are typical of the “Alto, Sanders, Spiro, and Haley foci” and suggest a
tentative date approaching 1300 A.D.
In the Late Caddo period, there is a shift in site location from the major drainages to the headwaters
of smaller tributaries, which resulted in numerous small hamlets scattered throughout most of
Northeastern Texas. However, major sites such as Sam Kaufman ([Roitsch] 41RR16), Wright
Plantation (41RR7), and the Belcher Mound (16CD13) (Harris 1953b; Skinner et al. 1969; Webb
1959; Perttula et al. 2001) were continuously occupied on the banks of the Red River in Texas and
Louisiana during this period. Farming was an important contributor to their diet (Perttula 2008).
The use of maize peaked during the Late Caddo period as observed in the isotopic and skeletal
records (Wilson 2012; Wilson and Perttula 2013, Perttula et al. 2014). Materials were traded from
the Plains/Southwest to the Texas Gulf Coast (Perttula 1998:12; Vehik 2002) to the Southeastern
United States (Skinner et al. 1969:101, 103). Late Caddo assemblages continue the trend of
diversification, most notably in the expansion of vessel form types including the incensario form
and effigy vessels, along with a wide variety of jar and bowl forms and an increased use of
appliques (Perttula 2013:Figures 10-15). Engraved wares within decorated ceramic assemblages
become more ubiquitous during the Late Caddo period in East Texas (Perttula 2015b:22). These
engraved fine wares include McCurtain Phase Avery, Simms, and Hudson Engraved, Texarkana
Phase Barkman, Hatchel, Hodges, Taylor Engraved, and Titus Phase Ripley, Wilder, Bailey, and
Turner engraved, Frankston Phase Poyner Engraved (Perttula 2013:194-198). Additional fine
wares include Keno and Foster Trailed. The period also marks an increased usage of brushed utility
wares, particularly in Frankston and Titus Phase sites (Perttula 2015b:23). Grog remains the main
tempering agent in Late Caddo ceramics, but shell becomes a more prominent tempering agent,
though high proportions of its use are only noted from sites located in the upper Sulphur and middle
Red River (Perttula 2015b:30). Most of the Late Caddo red-slipped ceramics have shell temper
(Perttula 2015b:23). Many of the traditions and styles that define the Late Caddo period carry over
into the Historic Caddo period. The most significant difference between the two periods as pertains
to ceramic production is that shell-tempered pottery becomes common throughout East Texas postAD 1700 (Perttula 2015b:31).
There is a break in the archaeological record for a period of two hundred years, at the end of the
Late Caddo period. There is no evidence of Spanish or French occupation in Fannin or Lamar
counties. The Womack site (41LR1) represents the primary evidence for historic Native American
occupation; it is located on a bluff, overlooking the Red River, in northern Lamar County (Harris
et al. 1965; Schambach 1996). Recent analysis of the collections held at TARL, demonstrate that
the site was occupied ca. A.D. 1700-1730, and the material cultural found at the site defines the
Womack Phase of the Historic Caddo period (Perttula 2015d:31). The Womack Phase has been
identified in the collections from the Sanders, Goss Farm 41FN12, and Harling Mound sites
(Perttula 2015c:31). Glass trade beads were recovered from individual burials at the Sanders site
(Harris 1953a:20) as well as 478 glass beads from the surface south of the mounds (Harris and
Harris 1967:20; Perttula et al. 2015). Harris also found an effigy-smoking pipe with the head of a
lamb or sheep on the surface near one of the graves (Harris 1953a:20). The pipe may have been
trade material from the early 1800s (Perttula et al. 2015:77), but the glass beads were dated to the
1700s (Harris and Harris 1967:131; Duffield and Jelks 1961:70-71). A hundred glass trade beads
were also recovered from the Goss Farm site (41FN12 [A1-2]; Harris 1953a:20). Recent analysis
of the Goss Farm collection at TARL confirm that the site has Sanders and Womack Phase

artifacts, however, it also appears to contain Late Archaic and Woodland occupations (Perttula
2015a:57).
Based upon the information obtained from the limited previous investigations done on the ranch
property, it appears that Native Americans have repeatedly occupied the area since the Paleoindian
period. Artifacts dating to this period have been identified from the Goss Farm site (Perttula
2015a:57). Additionally, Perttula’s recent analysis of collections associated with sites on the
property demonstrates that there is some evidence of Late Archaic occupation at the Sanders site
(Perttula et al. 2015:82), and he goes on to say there is a Woodland occupation at the Sanders,
Harling, and Goss Farm sites (Perttula et al. 2015:82; Perttula 2015a:57 and c:83). The most
intense occupation of the area appears to have occurred during the Sanders Phase of the Middle
Caddo and then again during the Womack Phase of the Historic Caddo until the early 18th century
(Perttula et al. 2015:82).
Historic Occupation
Given that there is an overlap of time with the Historic Caddo and Historic European periods, there
is evidence of interaction between the Caddo and Europeans. The first Europeans to encounter the
Caddo people were the remnants of de Soto-Moscoso Entrada between 1542 and 1543 (Girard et
al. 2014:102). However, based on the reconstructed path the entrada took through the Caddo region
south of the Arkansas River and into East Texas, it is unlikely that they had direct contact with the
Caddo population living on the Red River in the vicinity of Riverby Ranch. It would not be until
the mid-1600s that more significant interactions between the two groups occurred in the form of
explorers, fur traders, missionaries, and soldiers (Girard et al. 2014:106). Perttula’s recent work
on site collections demonstrates that the Harling, Goss, and Sanders sites have European trade
goods (Perttula et al. 2015:75; Perttula 2015a:57 and c:81). A single 18th century blade gun flint,
possible kettle fragments, as well as brass tinklers, a Spanish Real coin (1759-1788), iron spikes,
clay pipe fragments with the head of a sheep or lamb, and more than 50 white and blue glass beads
were recovered from the Sanders site (Perttula et al. 2015:75). Glass beads and metal buttons were
found at the Goss Farm site (Perttula 2015a:57), and glass beads were also part of the collection
associated with the Harling Mound (Perttula 2015c:81). Based upon these artifacts, it is clear that
during the Womack Phase, the Caddo living in the area had access to or interaction with early
Europeans. The various Caddo groups were forcibly pushed out of East Texas between 1836 and
1839 (Girard et al. 2014:130). While some relocated to Indian Territory, others moved into the
upper Brazos River drainage. This group remained there until 1859, when they were forced to
relocate to the Washita River Valley in Indian Territory (Girard et al. 2014:130).
Fannin County was created from a portion of Red River County and was one of the first counties
founded in Texas. On December 14, 1837, the Republic of Texas Congress named the county after
James Walker Fannin, Jr., a Texas Revolution hero (Carter 1885; Hodge 1966; Scott 1982;
Strickland 1930; Tate 2001; Pigott 2014). Texas became a state on December 29, 1845, and,
shortly thereafter, the Texas Legislature approved the present boundaries of Fannin County. Most
early settlers of Fannin County were from southern states, particularly North Carolina, Tennessee,
and Kentucky (Strickland 1930; Templin et al. 1946). The original county seat was located at Old
Warren, also known as Fort Kitchen, on the Grayson/Fannin county line. Old Warren was
established in 1836 when Abel Warren, an Indian trader from Fort Smith, Arkansas, settled there.
He built a fort to serve as protection against raiding Indians and a trading post for friendly tribes

(Hodge 1966). Old Warren was home to the first courthouse, school, post office, and Masonic
Lodge in the county. Due to an increased concern over Indian attacks and a political shift, which
strengthened the community of Bois d’Arc the county seat was moved from Old Warren to the city
of Bois d'Arc, on January 16, 1843. In 1844, Bois d'Arc was later renamed Bonham (Pigott 2014).
Historically, several tribes inhabited the area: the Cherokee, Tehuacana, Keechi, Waco, Caddo,
Shawnee, and others. Fannin County’s early settlers describe numerous conflicts with the Native
Americans in the area. Stories describing Natives murdering and mutilating local residents were
as common as tales of horse and livestock thievery along Bois d’Arc Creek (Strickland 1930).
Early accounts state that a Shawnee Village was situated northeast of Bois d’Arc Creek’s
confluence with Honey Grove Creek (Strickland 1930:287; Brune 1981:181). The village was a
mile northeast of the proposed reservoir and due north of the Shiloh Church and Cemetery.
Between 1837 and 1839, tensions escalated between the settlers and Native American groups in
the area. The Shawnee were described in most oral tradition stories, but some conflicts were
described between the Caddo, Choctaw, and Kickapoo (Strickland 1930). According to early
accounts in 1839, Holland Coffee, an early settler, used his prestige and influence to negotiate a
peace treaty with the Natives until they were finally moved out of the county a few years later
(Strickland 1930:298).
Settlers began moving into the study area in the 1830s and 1840s, and the first land patents on
Riverby Ranch as it presently exists were executed in 1845, when Hilory B. Bush and Richard R.
Beal received their land patents. Over the next 66 years, 52 more land patents were filed on the
various properties that make up Riverby Ranch today. Overall, the property has been inhabited
since the mid to late 1800s and the detailed history is presented in the larger survey report (Davis
et al. 2016: 36-72). The WRP area was largely owned and farmed by Joe Goss for the first half of
the 20th century.
Historic Map and Aerial Review
A detailed map and aerial review is available in the Riverby Survey report (Davis et al. 2016: 72),
therefore, this section will solely focus on the WRP portion of the property. A variety of historic
maps were available for analysis of the property, these include a 1936 and 1961 General Highway
Map (GHM) of Fannin County, the 1939 Fannin County Soil Map (FCSM), the 1948 Direct, OklaTex 15’ USGS topographic map, and the 1980 Monkstown and Direct, Texas and New Oberlin
and Lake West, Oklahoma 7.5’ USGS topographic maps. All these maps show structures and roads
throughout the Riverby Ranch area. Using GIS and geo-referenced digital copies of the maps, the
structures and roads were digitalized in an effort to quantify the data shown. While the 1936
highway map is useful in seeing the general layout of structures and roads, it is not detailed enough
to tabulate individual structures on the property. However, the map shows that there are numerous
homes in the Newt and Riverby areas (Figure 45). Additionally, it shows one crossing of Bois
d’Arc Creek. This crossing is referred to by locals as the Rocky Ford Crossing (Smith, Goss, and
Dobbs personal communications 2014). The 1936 map also shows that relatively all structures
were at the edge of the Bois d’Arc floodplain, which is defined by the boundaries of the WRP. The
more accurately scaled soil map shows that there were two crossing of Bois d’Arc Creek and also
demonstrates that homes were kept out of the Bois d’Arc floodplain.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE LBCR RIVERBY RANCH WRP IMPACT AREAS

In addition to reviewing the historic maps, a variety of historic aerials were available for review
including the 1937/38, 1949, 1950, 1955, 1956, 1963, 1969, 1974, 2008, 2014, 2015, and 2016.
Using these aerials along with the extracted historic map data, it is clear that the maps give a
representative view of settlement of the area. However, what is not clear from the historic maps is
which areas were under plow during the various years. Using the 2008 high altitude color infrared
aerial (IRA) photographs of the area, all densely wooded areas were mapped in GIS (Davis et al.
2016: Figure 49). According to these aerials, the property contained approximately 2,091 acres of
densely wooded land. It is apparent that most of the property was cleared of dense vegetation as
early as 1937 (Figure 50). These 1937/38 Tobin aerials show the largest forested areas being
present in the southeast portion of the property along Bois d’Arc Creek (WRP area). These early
aerials also show that most of the property north of FM 79 along the Red River, was under
cultivation. The 1950 aerials show that portions of the Bois d’Arc floodplain were beginning to be
cleared, and by 1963, it was nearly all cleared. By 1969 the WRP area largely matched the 2008
forested areas.
Specific review of the DB locations shows that DB1, DB2, DB3, DB4, and DB11 are all situated
at the 450’ contour, while DB5, DB6, DB7, DB8, DB9, and DB10 are all set back to the 460’
contour on the Monkstown and Direct, TX 7.5’ USGS maps. However, recent aerials demonstrate
that each of these DB locations has undergone extensive land modifications which was done prior
to enrolling the portion of the property in the WRP. A larger man-made dike was built using the
sediments in the immediate area of these 11 locations. As for the RP corridors, the USGS maps
shows that there were existing drainages at RP1, RP2, RP3, and RP4. However, All, but RP2
appear to have been straighten for agricultural purposes. Additionally, RP3 was extensively
modified during the construction of the dike. The drainage for RP5 does not appear at all on the
1981 topo maps, but does appear to be partially present on aerials
Previous Investigations
A detailed and thorough review of the previous investigations for Riverby Ranch is available in
the survey report (Davis et al. 2016: 10-30), therefore a brief and streamlined discussion will be
presented here. A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA 2017) shows there are no
SALs or nominated NRHP sites recorded within Riverby Ranch or in the immediate area. Prior to
the Riverby Ranch survey, there were 20 reported archaeological sites (8 prehistoric, 5 historic,
and 7 multicomponent) within the boundaries of the property (Davis et al. 2016: 10). These sites
included the Goss Farm site (41FN12) and the Harling (Morgan) Mound (41FN1) and several
other unstudied historic and prehistoric sites. This total also included the recent work by SWCA,
Inc., (SWCA), which extended the site boundaries for the T.M. Sanders site (41LR2) into Riverby
Ranch (Acuña et al. 2013; TASA 2017). Only two of these 20 sites (41FN86 and 41LR2) had been
determined to be eligible for listing on the NRHP. Eleven of these sites had been determined
ineligible, yet three of these sites were only determined ineligible within the linear survey corridor
within which they were recorded. The remaining six sites were undetermined while the Harling
Mound was listed as being destroyed (TASA 2017). Two of these undetermined sites (41FN12
and 41FN39) fall within the boundaries of the WRP and will not be impacted by the overall project
or by the proposed impacts as part of these WRP improvements.
The first archaeological work conducted on the property was in 1930, when a team from UT
excavated several skeletons and recovered a few artifacts from a prehistoric Caddo site (41FN12)

on the Goss Farm near the mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek (TARL 2017). In 1931, Gardner and A.T.
Jackson from UT, began excavations on the T.M. Sanders site (41LR2) on the east bank of Bois
d’Arc Creek across from the Goss Farm. At the time, this was the first major discovery of
Mississippian prestige artifacts found west of the Mississippi River (Jackson et al. 2000:1; Krieger
1946). Overall more than 60 burials were found to contain artifacts including shell beads, several
types of ceramic vessels, gorgets, pipes, ear spools, and numerous dart and arrow points. After UT
finished digging the site, it was revisited various times by avocational archaeologists from the
Dallas Archeological Society (DAS). Two of these avocational archeologists, Rex Housewright
and Lester Wilson from Wylie, Texas, visited the Goss and Sanders farms several times beginning
in the 1930s. On one of their visits to the Sanders site in 1937, they, along with Henry Hanna,
uncovered some additional burials (Housewright 1941). The first burial contained three individuals
in the extended supine position facing east.
On one of his many visits, Housewright (1946) describes uncovering a child’s burial at the Goss
Farm. The burial included a necklace of more than 260 turquoise beads and two turquoise
pendants. These were the main details he published in The Record (Housewright 1946). However,
Housewright’s personal notes are now part of the private “Vance-Wilson-Housewright Collection”
in North Texas. While examining his original hand-written notes, it was discovered that he
describes finding the burial on the west bank of Bois d’Arc Creek approximately 150 yards
northwest of the large Sanders Mound (West Mound also referred to as Mound 2), which is on the
east side of the creek (Housewright 1940). He states that the burial was north of the crest on a
natural ridge running parallel to the Red River. This description places the site more than half a
mile north of where TASA (2017) shows the Goss Farm site. This description also matches more
closely the one Gardner described as being closer to the mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek. A few years
later in 1951, R.K. Harris visited the Goss Farm and found nearly 100 trade beads, 75 flint
specimens, a turquoise bead, and the base of an early Plainview-like dart point (Harris 1951:20).
A couple years later, Harris (1953a:20) collected a cache of four mussel shell hoes from the site.
It was this cache that convinced him that mussel shell was used by prehistoric populations as hoes.
He described the mussel shells as being well-worn and polished on the digging edge. Based upon
Perttula’s (2015a:57) recent analysis of the Goss Farm collection, the site contains multiple
occupations beginning with Late Paleoindian and Woodland periods, then during the Sanders
Phase (A.D. 1100-1300) of the Middle Caddo period and most intensely during the Womack Phase
(ca. late 17th to early 18th century) of the Historic Caddo period (Perttula 2015a:57).
In August of 1950, the Harling Mound (41FN1), then referred to as the Morgan Mound, was first
visited by archaeologists R. L. Stephenson, E. O. Miller, and Lester Wilson (TARL 2015; Perttula
2015c:71). They describe an abundance of artifacts on the surface in the plowed fields. They also
note that the mound was heavily overgrown with trees and had never been cultivated. This
description would match the 1937 and 1948 aerials, which appear to show the mound as a dark
spot surrounded by cropland. Based on this information it appears Morgan never farmed the
mound. The crew also noted that there was a historic cemetery dating to the early 19 th century on
the mound surface (TARL 2015; Perttula 2015c:76). Additional research into the collection
revealed that in 1963, a portion of a Beal headstone was in the collection. This cemetery on top of
the mound represents the missing Beal Cemetery. The skeletal collection contains ten individuals,
which were partially excavated by E. Mott Davis in 1960, and then by J.R. Gipson in 1963 (TARL
2015, Perttula 2015c:76).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE LBCR RIVERBY RANCH WRP IMPACT AREAS

After the initial visit in 1950, the site was later investigated in 1959 by archaeologists from UT
(TARL 2014). Curtis Tunnell first visited the site in 1959, where he and Lathel Duffield mapped
the mound as approximately 230 ft long, 170 ft wide, and 7 ft high (Tunnell 1959). E. Mott Davis
conducted limited excavations on the mound in 1960 (Davis 1962a and 1962b). During the
excavations, no prehistoric burials were found, but ceramics recovered dated to the Sanders Phase.
His notes at TARL (2015a) describe that they encountered a couple of historic burials in the top
of the mound. According to Davis (1962b:489), the mound was likely constructed in one phase
and he estimated that they excavated approximately eight percent of the cubic content of the
mound. Davis speculated that the mound functioned as a frontier outpost for the Caddo and tribes
of the plains (Davis 1962b:480). The excavation was prompted by R. A. Harling’s desire to level
the mound to improve his ability to farm the area. A final report on this investigation was never
written and it appears the site was destroyed, as a letter from Harling, dated January 10, 1963,
states that the demolition had begun.
After those initial investigations, professional archaeologists did not return to Riverby Ranch until
the 1980s (TASA 2017). Since then, there have been several archaeological surveys conducted
within the property. Most of them have been linear studies for pipeline or roadway projects. The
first study conducted in the area was part of the Red River Archaeological Project done by North
Texas State University ([NTSU] now University of North Texas) in the early 1980s with funding
from the THC (TASA 2017). The multiphase Red River project by NTSU was focused on
assessing the archaeological potential of the Red River Basin. The survey only recorded one site
on the property, 41FN39, which is on the west bank of Bois d’Arc Creek (within the WRP), directly
across from the Sanders site (41LR2). The site is described as Woodland to Caddo in age, and
likely associated with the Sanders site. The next survey was in 1989 for the Black Marlin Pipeline
project (Heartfield, Price and Green, Inc. [HPG] 1990). Shortly after that, the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) conducted a survey along FM 79 in 1995 (TARL 2014). The final
linear surveys were conducted between 2007 and 2012 for the Gulf Crossing (Hajic and Mandel
2009; Lackowicz et al. 2009; Mandel 2009; McLean et al. 2009; and McLean 2009), Midcontinent
Express (Stanyard and Tucker 2007), and Keystone (Acuña et al. 2013; Cody et al. 2014) pipeline
projects. These pipelines essentially parallel each other, however they diverge upon reaching FM
79.
The site boundaries for 41LR2 were extended to FM 79 and west over the county line to the eastern
bank of Bois d’Arc Creek by the Keystone Pipeline project. According to the revisit site form filed
by SWCA, 54 pieces of debitage, two ceramic sherds, five small burned clay fragments, four pieces
of burned rock, one possible piece of red ochre, a possible hammerstone, an edge-modified flake,
and a utilized flake scraper were recovered during their visit. A total of 38 shovel tests were
excavated during this field assessment, 16 encountered cultural material (TASA 2014). The site
form says the site was avoided by directional drilling. TARL and the Smithsonian, both have
extensive collections from this site, which was initially excavated by UT back in 1931 (Krieger
1946; Jackson et al. 2000), then sporadically through the 1940s and 1950s by members of DAS
(Housewright 1940; Wilson and Housewright 1941; Wilson 1948; Hanna 1950; Harris 1953a).
The mounds and majority of the site core are on private property and are still farmed today. As
with the other sites in this area, Perttula has recently done some additional archaeological survey
on the privately-owned portion of the site on the Crawford Ranch, directly across Bois d’Arc Creek

from Riverby Ranch, as well as reanalyzed the TARL and Smithsonian collections (Perttula et al.
2015).
Perttula and his crew conducted limited shovel testing and surface survey just after the area was
plowed, prior to planting crops in March of 2014 on the Crawford Ranch across Bois d’Arc Creek
from Riverby Ranch. Their surface survey identified 33 surface collection areas near the mounds
(Perttula et al. 2015:4). Due to the extremely wet conditions at the time of the survey, only four
shovel tests were excavated. These were in three of the surface collection areas and all encountered
midden deposits, with artifacts coming out of the top 60 cmbs. It total, they recovered 1689 sherds,
151 chipped stone tools, 513 lithic debitage, a possible gunflint, a ground stone celt, and animal
bones/mussel shell fragments (Perttula et al. 2015:6). Only 10 percent of the ceramics recovered
had decorative elements. The crew returned to the site in 2016, when they conducted additional
surface collection of the Crawford portion of the site as well as the mounds still owned by the
Sanders family. They also excavated shovel tests on the Crawford portion of the site. They noted
that the Crawford and Sanders farms are both continually plowed, and their survey was conducted
right after plowing had occurred. They describe that the Crawford portion of the site was recently
ripped and disked causing disturbance of the top 30-45 cmbs (Perttula et al. 2016a:2). During their
visit, they discovered that the farmers leasing the Sanders portion of the site had bulldozed a
portion of the West Mound to obtain fill for an area eroding to the north. This activity exposed a
burned clay house floor as well as midden deposits. They noted the feature was present 30 cmbs
and was approximately 10 cm thick (Perttula et al. 2016a:3-5). They also stated that they believed
the site was still being collected as they found recent footprints on site (Perttula et al. 2016a:2).
During the site visit, they collected more than 900 ceramic sherds, 70 chipped or ground stone
tools, 259 pieces of chipped stone, as well as burned clay, faunal remains, mussel shell, as well as
some historic artifacts dating to the late-19th to early 20th century. Perttula and his crew have plans
to continue their work on the site, and they conclude that the site was initially occupied during the
Late Archaic, through the Woodland period. The first ancestral Caddo occupation took place
during the Middle Caddo Sanders Phase (A.D. 1100-1300). The site was also occupied later during
the Womack Phase of the Historic Caddo (A.D. 1670-1740) as evidenced by European trade goods
(Perttula et al. 2015:82).
ARC conducted the most recent and comprehensive Riverby Ranch (Davis et al. 2016). Overall,
3,670 acres were surveyed. A total of 87 sites (20 prehistoric, 55 historic, and 12 multicomponent)
are recorded on the property. Twenty-eight structures were found to meet the historic-age guideline
as established for this project and were evaluated. None of them maintained the level of integrity
required to be considered for listing in the NRHP. No evidence of Paleoindian sites was found on
the ranch, and most of the prehistoric sites identified could not be dated and likely represent the
ephemeral remains of Archaic period sites. However, several sites were found to possibly date to
the Woodland, but more likely date to the prehistoric Caddo periods. Significant sites dating to the
Middle and Historic Caddo periods were found along the leading edge of the Cooke Terrace. The
majority of the historic sites date to the 20th century, with the exception of cemeteries. Oral
histories confirm that all 19th to early 20th century residences were removed after Goss and
Morgan sold their properties. Four sites (41LR2, 41FN9, 41FN86, and 41FN144) were considered
eligible for the NRHP and as SALs. Sites 41FN41/41FN88, 41FN235, and 41FN243 were
recommended as eligible for the NRHP and as SALs. Additional testing will occur near several
sites adjacent to the WRP to help finalize NRHP recommendations.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE LBCR RIVERBY RANCH WRP IMPACT AREAS

ARC also conducted survey in the LBCR project area in 2011 and 2013 (Davis et al. 2014) as well
as additional NRHP testing at 17 sites in 2015 and 2016 (Hall et al. 2017). The project’s research
design focused on three major research topics: Late Pleistocene Geomorphology, The Shifting
Ecotone, and Settling Into the Region (Skinner et al. 2010). The research design developed a
sampling strategy that focused on landforms likely to have been occupied prehistorically and
historically. Approximately 4,500 acres were surveyed. The survey was amplified by walking
approximately 40 miles (500 acres) of creek channels, bringing the survey acreage total to 5,000
acres. A total of 58 sites (28 prehistoric, 26 historic, and four prehistoric/historic) were recorded
(Davis et al. 2014:377). Additionally, 38 standing structures were found to meet the historic-age
guidelines; these were evaluated for eligibility for listing on the NRHP. None were found to be
eligible for the NRHP. The results of the survey demonstrated that the earliest occupation was
during the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods, but the terrace sediments were flushed out of
the valley before 2000 B.C. In situ occupation during the Late Archaic and Woodland periods was
sporadic. Early Caddo occupation may have occurred about A.D. 1000 and only minimal evidence
of later Caddo occupation was found. The majority of the historic sites date to the late 19th to mid20th century. Oral histories confirm that most 19th century residences were removed to increase
farm and pasture land or were replaced by modern structures. Of the 17 sites that underwent NRHP
testing, only three were recommended eligible for NRHP or as SALs (Hall et al. 2017). Prehistoric
burials dating between the Woodland and Middle Caddo periods were discovered at 41FN114 and
41FN151 as well as numerous ceramics and lithic material. An extensive assemblage dating from
the Woodland to the Historic Caddo periods was found at 41FN120. All three sites had persevered
organics and datable materials demonstrating a great potential for additional research.
Additional surveys conducted in the county include the 2005, ARC (Skinner et al. 2005)
investigation of approximately 1,700 acres at the proposed location of Lake Ralph Hall, which will
be constructed north of Ladonia, in the North Sulphur River floodplain. Seventeen historic and
prehistoric sites were recorded during the survey (41FN60 through 41FN76). ARC recommended
further testing for a Middle to Late Archaic campsite (41FN68), a deeply buried Middle Archaic
campsite (41FN66), and near the cobble core/chopper tool site (41FN73). The date for the
core/chopper may be older than 10,860±40 B.P. (Beta 206953). Further survey should lead to the
discovery of more deeply buried archaeological sites (Bousman and Skinner 2007).
Various small-scale surveys have been conducted throughout Fannin County. Most of these studies
have found little or no evidence of prehistoric or historic occupation. ARC surveyed for the South
Wastewater Interceptor in Bonham, which tested in the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain, as well as on
the upland toe slope and the overlooking upland ridge but did not find sites in those settings
(Skinner and Davis 2009).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The original research design for the overall project was developed to guide the field and laboratory
methods in order to help interpret the prehistoric and historic occupations of the LBCR project
areas (Skinner et al. 2010; Davis et al. 2014). The following research design is based on that
original but tailored and refined to the specific impacts for the RP corridors and DB locations,
which was coordinated with the Signatories of the PA prior to the issuance of the TAP.
The DB locations are found at or above the 454’ contour elevation where prehistoric and historic
sites have been documented along the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain margin. Some of these DB
locations are near or overlap with previously recorded archaeological sites. These locations have
potential for recovering prehistoric artifacts. These sites are typically found in the degrading
upland edge of the Ambrose or Kansan terraces. These sites do not preserve well in the sandy soils
and a low density of artifacts have been worked into the bioturbated sediments, which are generally
void of dateable materials or artifacts. The historic sites are ephemeral remains of homesteads or
trash dumps that have been left along the various drainages or ranch roads.
The RP corridors are found along ephemeral intermittent tributaries that flow into Bois d’Arc
Creek. While prehistoric sites are shown within the WRP along Bois d’Arc Creek, professional
archaeologists have not conducted any work in this setting since the 1980s and site locations are
only tentative and have not been field verified. Research conducted during the Riverby Ranch
survey demonstrated that sites 41FN12 (the Goss Farm Site) is probably mapped on TASA in the
wrong location (Davis et al. 2016:205-206). This could be true for 41FN39 as well, since the report
that documented that site was never completed. However, neither the reported nor the likely
location of these two sites falls within the proposed impact areas. Geoarchaeological investigations
for the Gulf Crossing Pipeline Project suggested that the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain is filled
unstable and rapid sedimentation unlikely to contain buried deposits and was unfavorable for
prehistoric occupation (Mandel 2009:2). Therefore, the Signatories requested that the areas be
shovel tested in accordance with the previous survey methods to identify if any cultural resources
were present in the top 80 cm of these narrow corridors.
Methodology
None of the RP corridors intersected with any known archaeological sites recorded on the property,
however, four of the proposed DB locations are near or partially intersect recorded archaeological
sites (41FN87/41FN91, 41FN188, 41FN199, and 41FN214) as shown on Figure 6. Only 41FN188
has a NRHP recommendation for further work inside the WRP, which is on the opposite side of
the man-made dike from the location of the proposed work. Additional shovel tests were excavated
in the area near 41FN188 to confirm survey site boundaries on the 25-m grid. The other three sites
are all recommended as ineligible for listing on the NRHP (Davis et al. 2016: Table 106). However,
additional shovel tests were excavated on the 25-m grid in the area of 41FN199 from DB11
towards sites 41FN200 and 41FN201. Site 41FN87/41FN91 were previously determined ineligible
and fall within the previously studied 300 ft pipeline corridor that runs through Riverby Ranch.
The proposed survey for the riparian corridors and dike breach locations will be confined to the
areas where earthworks and ground disturbance activities are anticipated. No additional survey

work was conducted in the WRP or at any of the known archaeological sites within the WRP since
they will not be impacted.
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (2014) and the
methodology of the overall LBCR Research Design (Skinner et al. 2010). ARC excavated at least
three shovel tests per acre in areas that will be disturbed. In the RP corridors, the field crew will
walk a transect parallel to the channels. The one-person transect covered a 30 m (100 ft) wide
corridor as described in THC standards (2014). Shovel tests (STs) excavated along these transects
were 100 m apart or less. STs averaged 30 cm in diameter. For each of the DB locations, STs were
excavated in the work areas and the channel banks were inspected for cultural resources that might
be eroding out of the sediments. STs were excavated in 10 cm levels down to 80 cmbs (2.6 feet)
or the subsoil whichever came first. This depth is deeper than the anticipated impacts from the
proposed work (20 cm). ST soil matrices were described on the basis of composition, texture, and
color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2010) was used to identify soil colors. The field crew made
notes about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and disturbed areas where subsoil was
exposed. Photographs were taken during the survey using a 16-megapixel digital camera. ST
locations were marked with a handheld Garmin GPSmap64st receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into three sections. The first describes the various project areas and their
settings along with results of the pedestrian survey. The second section discusses the
archaeological sites recorded during the survey and conclusions close the chapter. While STs are
described generally throughout the survey results, the negative STs detailed in Table 4 at the end
of the survey results section. Positive STs associated with sites are described in each of those
discussions.
Survey Results
Survey was conducted within the 16 identified HPAs (Figure 2 and Figure 7) totaling 36.71 acres:
11 dike breach locations (DB1 through DB11) and five riparian buffer areas (RP1 through RP5).
A total of 208 STs were excavated throughout various areas and only 16 were positive for cultural
resources.

DB1
This dike breach location is found within the WRP boundaries at the edge of the Ambrose Alluvial
Terrace. The elevation within the work area ranges from 450’ to 458’. The general environment
of this DB was heavily forested with bois d’arc, oaks, and hackberry trees as well as an abundance
of greenbriar (Figure 9). The leaf litter and underbrush obscured the ground surface resulting in 0
percent ground visibility. While conducting the survey, the crew startled wild pigs resting in the
area. The low wet nature of the area makes great wallows for pigs, and they had rooted and
disturbed a good portion of the work area. Four STs were excavated within this area (STs DB1-1
through DB1-4; Figure 8; Table 4). ST DB1-1 revealed 50 cm of mottled yellowish/strong brown
coarse sandy loam underlain by mottled yellowish brown coarse silty sand and strong brown sandy
clay. ST DB1-2 exposed 40 cm of mottled light yellowish brown/very dark gray loamy sand,
overlaying 20 cm of mottled coarse sand of the same color, and further underlain by 20 cm of very
dark gray clayey coarse sand. ST DB1-3 consisted of 3 cm of dark brown sandy loam underlain
by strong brown sand extending to at least 80 cmbs. Lastly, ST DB1-4 revealed 20 cm of very dark
grayish brown sandy loam underlain by a mottled light yellowish/grayish brown clayey sand. No
cultural resources were observed on the surface and none were recovered from the STs.

DB2
This dike breach work area is found in the Bois d’Arc floodplain at elevations ranging from 445’
to 454’ at the top of the dike (Figure 10). The dike here cuts off Black Branch from feeding into
Bois d’Arc Creek. The general environment of the DB was comprised of chest-high grass-covered
fields with some lightly wooded areas, resulting in 0 percent ground visibility (Figure 11). The
survey crew observed wild pigs and their wallows within this low lying very wet area.
Additionally, the majority of the work area was comprised of the Black Branch channel (Figure
12) as well as the channel that was excavated along the dike. This left a very little area on either
side of Black Branch to shovel test. To the south approximately 20 m, is the location of prehistoric
site 41FN214. This site is situated above the 454’ contour on a small knoll overlooking the
floodplain. A total of four STs were excavated within DB2 (STs DB2-1 through DB2-4; Table 4).
The ST soils were generally similar, with 5-40 cm of mottled very dark gray/strong brown
loam/clay loam underlain by mottled dark gray/reddish brown/strong brown silty clay/clayey
loam. No cultural resources were observed on the surface and none were recovered from the STs.

DB3
DB3 is located within the boundary for the WRP at the edge of the Ambrose Alluvial Terrace
down into the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain (Figure 13). Elevations in the work area range from
446’ at the excavated channel to 453’ near the western edge of the work area and on top of the
dike. The general environment in this work area was similar to DB1, with dense tree cover and
thick underbrush resulting in 0 percent ground visibility (Figure 14); there are some areas of
standing water associated with wetland development. Approximately 120 m to the southwest is
prehistoric site 41FN248, which sits on top of the terrace north of an ephemeral stream that flowed
into a tributary of Black Branch prior to the construction of the dike. As with the other work areas,
there was a wide drainage channel excavated parallel to the dike. A total of four STs were
excavated within this area (STs DB3-1 through DB3-4; Table 4). ST DB3-1 consisted of 50 cm of
very dark gray sandy loam containing calcium carbonate, underlain by very dark gray compact
sandy loam. ST DB3-2 and DB3-3 revealed 65-75 cm of black silty clay and terminated at the
water table; DB3-3 soil was mottled with dark grayish brown silty sand. ST DB3-4 was comprised
of 30 cm of mottled very dark grayish /dark yellowish-brown sandy clay loam containing iron
redox, underlain by mottled grayish/ yellowish brown sandy clay loam also containing iron redox.
No cultural resources were observed on the surface and nothing was recovered from the STs.

DB4
This dike breach work area is located on the southern end of Riverby Ranch in the Bois d’Arc
Creek floodplain near where it abuts the Kansan Terrace. The lowest elevation in the work area is
found on the south side of the dike in the excavated drainage channel at 448’. The highest elevation
is found on the dike at 459’. The general environment of this area was moderately wooded with
winged elm, poison ivy, greenbriar, and knee- to chest-high grasses, resulting in 0 to 30 percent
ground visibility (Figure 16). Four STs (DB4-1 through DB4-4; Table 4) were excavated on the
north side of the dike in the area that was least disturbed. STs revealed similar soils to one another
with 60-65 cm of wet black clay underlain by wet and mottled yellowish brown to very dark
grayish brown clay; STs DB4-2 through DB4-4 also contained crawfish burrows. No cultural
resources were observed on the surface and none were recovered from the STs.

DB5
At the leading edge of the Kansan Terrace where it meets with the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain
well within the WRP is where DB5 can be found (Figure 17). Elevations on either side of the dike
range from 460’ to 464’ while the top of the dike reaches 469’. The excavated channel along the
dike was not was only a trickle compared to the previous locations where there was an abundance
of water in the channels. The general environment here was very eroded, with bedrock and subsoil
exposed on the ground surface. The vegetation is similar to DB4: lightly wooded with knee- to
chest-high grasses and 0 percent ground visibility (Figure 18). Four STs were excavated within
this area (STs DB5-1 through DB5-4; Table 4). STs DB5-1 and DB5-2 revealed similar soils to
one another, with 40 cm of mottled red/gray/yellow sandy clay. ST DB5-3 consisted of 30 cm of
reddish brown sandy clay loam underlain by mottled strong brown/reddish yellow sandy clay with
degraded sandstone. ST DB5-4 exposed 50 cm of brown sand underlain by strong brown/reddish
yellow sandy clay. No cultural resources were observed on the surface and none were recovered
from the STs.

DB6
Like DB5, DB6 is at the leading edge of the Kansan Terrace where it meets the Bois d’Arc Creek
floodplain (Figure 19). The lowest elevation is found in the western corner at 467’ and the highest
is in the southern corner near 474’. The top of the dike is between 472’ and 475’. The general
environment of this area was very eroded along an unnamed ephemeral drainage that once flowed
into Bois d’Arc Creek. This low edge of the terrace had exposed bedrock and subsoil on the surface
(Figure 20) and can even be seen on the aerial. Additionally, quartzite gravels were observed on
the surface, and while some were large enough to potentially knap, the material quality was poor
and none of the gravel observed here had been modified/worked. Four STs were excavated within
this area (STs DB6-1 through DB6-4; Table 4). ST DB6-1 and DB6-3 revealed similar soils with
40-60 cm of dark yellowish-brown sandy loam underlain by mottled very pale brown/strong brown
sandy clay. ST DB6-2 and DB6-4 soils were also consistent to one another with 50-60 cm of
brown/grayish brown sandy loam over light yellowish-brown sand/fine sand, underlain by mottled
yellowish brown/strong brown sandy clay with degraded sandstone. No cultural resources were
observed on the surface and none were recovered from the STs.

DB7
Just like the previous two work areas, DB7 is at the edge of the Kansan Terrace on the outside of
the WRP boundary (Figure 21). On the west side of the dike, the lowest elevation is 463’ but
reaches 473’ on the east side. The general environment of this area was ankle- to knee-high grass
fields resulting in 0 percent ground visibility (Figure 22). Four STs were excavated within this area
(STs DB7-1 through DB7-4; Table 4). STs DB7-1 and DB7-3 revealed similar soils to one another,
with 10 cm of yellow sandy loam underlain by compact black clay extending to at least 70 cmbs.
STs DB7-1 and DB7-3 also exposed similar soils to one another, with 30-40 cm of very dark
grayish brown clayey loam underlain by mottled dark grayish brown to light brownish gray clay.
No cultural resources were observed on the surface and none were recovered from the STs.

DB8
Located on the Kansan Terrace near site 41FN188, DB8 overlooks the Bois d’Arc Creek
floodplain. An elevation of 461’ is found north of the dike, while the southwest corner reaches
473’. A total of 44 STs were excavated within this area with 11 of them being positive for cultural
materials (Figure 23). Only the negative ST are described in this section as the positive STs will
be detailed in the following section for site 41FN260. One positive (ST DB8-6) was considered an
isolated occurrence (IO) as it was found on the edge of the stock pond (Table 3). This fine quartzite
secondary chip was found in the top 10 cm. STs 10 m to the south and west were negative. STs to
the north and east were not necessary due to the disturbance caused by the creation of the stock
pond and dike. The general environment here was partially wooded with cedars and scrub brush
on the north side of the dike, while the south side consisted mostly of calf- to waist-high grass
fields with 0 percent ground visibility (Figure 24). The profiles of all 33 negative STs were
consistent with 20 to 40 cm of brown or dark brown sandy loam resting on mottled yellowish red
and brown sandy clay (Table 4). Some STs contained thinner layers of sandy loam, while some
were clay from the surface. No other cultural resources were found outside the site and the IO.

DB9
Just like the last few breach work areas, DB9 sits on the edge of the Kansan Terrace and floodplain.
The natural elevations of the area range from 454’ to 456’, however, the excavation of the dike
and the stock pond have left sediment spoil piles in the southwest and southeast corners of the
work area (Figure 25). The top of the dike ranges from 460’ to 463’ while the piles in the corner
reach 468’ and 469’. The general environment here was ankle-high grass pastures surrounding the
dike and a stock pond, resulting in 0-40 percent ground visibility (Figure 26). Four STs were
excavated within this area (STs DB9-1 through DB9-4; Table 4). ST DB9-1 revealed 25 cm of
mottled brown/dark gray silty fat clay underlain by mottled dark gray/yellowish red silty fat clay.
ST DB9-2 soil consisted of 40 cm of mottled brown/dark gray silty fat clay and degraded
sandstone. ST DB9-3 was comprised of 50 cm of dark brown clayey loam over strong brown clay
with calcium carbonate. Lastly, ST DB9-4 revealed 32 cm of dark brown clay over brown clay
with calcium carbonate, further underlain by brown clay with degraded sandstone. No cultural
resources were observed on the surface and none were recovered from the STs.

DB10
DB10 is also located on the Kansan Terrace overlooking the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain. The DB
is between the boundary for the WRP and the easements for the various pipelines that run through
the property. There are two sites (41FN87 and 41FN91) nearby, both recorded during the pipeline
studies. Both sites were revisited by ARC, recommended ineligible, and concurred with by the
Signatories of the PA (Davis et al. 2016:243). A total of four STs were excavated within this area
(STs DB10-1 through DB10-4; Table 4). The general environment in this dike breach location was
ankle-high grass pastures, resulting in 0 percent ground visibility (Figure 28). ST DB10-1 revealed
25 cm of very dark grayish brown clay loam over 35 cm of brown silty coarse sand, further
underlain by a mottled clayey sand of dark yellowish brown/brown color. ST DB10-2 consisted of
40 cm of mottled brown/strong brown sandy clay. STs DB10-3 and DB10-4 soils were similar to
one another, with 27-80 cm of dark brown loam. No cultural resources were observed on the
surface and nothing was recovered from the STs.

DB11
Located on the northern extent of the Ambrose Alluvial Terrace overlooking the Bois d’Arc Creek
floodplain is a cluster of small historic and prehistoric sites near DB11. The area ranges in
elevation from 448’ at the creek channel to 475’ near site 41FN201. During the initial coordination
for this project, the Signatories requested that additional shovel tests be excavated on the 25m grid
to fill in empty spaces near sites 41FN199, 41FN200, and 41FN201 as well as the previously
documented IOs (Davis et al. 2016:Figure 273). A total of 38 STs were excavated within this area
(Table 4), of which, five were positive for prehistoric artifacts. This resulted in two new sites being
recorded (41FN261 and 41FN262) which will be discussed in the following section. The general
environment here consisted of ankle- to knee-high grass fields with 0-20 percent ground visibility
(Figure 30). Shovel tests generally encountered 25 to 80 cm of brown or pale brown sand or sandy
loam above mottled clay in the elevations above 454’. Shovel tests along the edge of the drainage
channel encountered a variety of sand and sandy loam layers over various compact clays between
30 and 60 cmbs. Overall, no cultural resources were encountered within the workspace for the
DB11.

survey crew’s heads and trees including pine, maple and bois d’arc; these factors resulted in 0
percent ground visibility (Figure 40). STs RP5-1, RP5-2, RP5-5, RP5-7, and RP5-18 revealed 80
cm of very dark gray fat clay, while RP5-24 revealed 70 cm of very compact black clay; RP5-3
and RP5-4 were similar to these soils as well, though these STs also showed caliche and gravel,
respectively. ST RP5-9 was comprised of 23 cm of mottled very dark gray and dark brown clay,
underlain by mottled soils of similar colors. STs RP5-10, RP5-11, RP5-13, RP5-15, RP5-22, and
RP5-25 consisted of 30-60 cm of mottled very dark gray and brown clay soils, with some sandy
soil as well. STs RP5-6, RP5-8, RP5-12, RP5-14, RP5-16, RP5-17, RP5-19 through RP5-21, RP523, and RP5-26 revealed similar soils to one another: 32-72 cm of very dark gray clay underlain
by mottled very dark gray and dark reddish brown/brown clay. No cultural resources were
observed on the surface and nothing was recovered from the STs.

Archaeological Sites
Three archaeological sites were recorded during the survey. These sites were located near DB8
and DB11, both of which were near previously recorded sites. For these two areas, the USACE
and the THC asked for additional STs in the area to fill in the gaps on the 25-m survey grid that
was used for the Riverby Ranch survey under TAP 6887.
41FN260
Located on the southeast side of the dike and site 41FN188 is prehistoric site 41FN260 (Figure
41). This site is approximately 2.3 km south of FM 79 on the leading edge of the Kansan Terrace.
The site is separated from site 41FN188 by the man-made dike and drainage channel that was
created before the property was registered in the WRP. At the time of the survey, the area was
covered with ankle- to calf-high grasses resulting in 0 to 30 percent ground visibility. The site is
covered with 5 to 20 cm of brown sandy loam that rests on a yellowish-red or pink sandy loam or
clay. Both rest on a mottled yellowish-red silty or sandy clay that was encountered as shallow as
20 cmbs and as deep as 60 cmbs. The site measures 45 m north/south by 35 m east/west (0.33
acres). It is bounded on the north and west by the man-made drainage channel, that likely bisected
41FN260 from 41FN188. A biface was found on the surface in the backdirt of a gopher hole near
ST DB8-8SW (Figure 42). Additionally, an edge-modified flake and a middle stage biface
fragment were recovered from STs (Figure 43), but no diagnostics were found at the site. A total
of 10 positive STs recovered 44 artifacts (Table 5 and Table 6). The assemblage contained nine
interior flakes, 10 interior chips, nine secondary flakes, seven secondary chips, one primary flake,
one primary chip, two pieces of shatter, a core, and a piece of FCR in addition to the three
previously mentioned artifacts. The raw material was mostly chert, but fine- and coarse-grained
quartzite were present. No organics or datable materials were recovered in any of the STs. Overall
the site is a low density deposit of prehistoric artifacts in the top 40 cm with no preserved organics
that has been heavily disturbed by bioturbation and the creation of the dike and drainage channel.
It has no apparent integrity and is not recommended as eligible for the NRHP or as an SAL.

41FN261
Located on the Ambrose Alluvial Terrace near sites 41FN199, 41FN200, and 41FN201 is a small
prehistoric site 41FN261 found in three positive STs (Table 7 and Figure 44). At the time of the
survey, the area was covered with ankle- to calf-high grasses. The site is covered with 15 to 25 cm
of brown compact sandy loam that rests on a yellowish-red mottled sandy clay. The site measures
30 m north/south by 30 m east/west (0.17 acres) and is approximately 10 m south of historic site
41FN200, which is why they were recorded as separate sites. To the south is a natural drainage
channel that was cut off from flowing into Bois d’Arc Creek by the man-made dike. A biface
fragment was recovered from ST DB11-30 (Figure 45), but no diagnostics were recovered at the
site. The positive STs recovered five artifacts (Table 8). In addition to the biface fragment, four
pieces of fine-grained quartzite debitage were recovered. These consist of an interior chip, primary
chip, secondary flake, and a piece of shatter. No organics or datable materials were recovered in
any of the STs. Overall the site is low density deposit of prehistoric artifacts in the top 40 cm with
no preserved organics that has been heavily disturbed by bioturbation and agricultural activities.
It has no apparent integrity and is not recommended as eligible for the NRHP or as an SAL.

41FN262
Located on the Ambrose Alluvial Terrace near sites 41FN199, 41FN200, and 41FN201 is a small
prehistoric site 41FN262 (Figure 46). At the time of the survey, the area was covered with ankleto calf-high grasses. The site is covered with 20 to 40 cm of brown sandy loam that rests on a pink
sand in some STs. Both layers rest on a pink and brown mottled sandy clay. The site measures 55
m north/south by 30 m east/west (0.29 acres). The two positive STs were combined with two
previously designated IOs from 2015 (Davis et al. 2016:307-308). These two 2015 STs contained
a chert core (ST 161-10-9) and a fine-grained quartzite biface (ST 161-10). The subsequent 2017
STs recovered four additional pieces of debitage, but no diagnostics have been recovered at the
site (Table 9). These consist of a chert primary, a fine-grained quartzite secondary, and a chert
interior flake as well as a chert secondary chip. No organics or datable materials were recovered
in any of the STs in 2015 or 2017. Overall the site is low density deposit of prehistoric artifacts in
the top 30 cm with no preserved organics that has been heavily disturbed by bioturbation and
agricultural activities. It has no apparent integrity and is not recommended as eligible for the NRHP
or as an SAL.

Conclusions
The results of the Riverby Ranch WRP survey for the DB locations are consistent with the results
of the larger survey conducted under TAP 6887 and the research design tailored to this project.
Overall a total of 36.71 acres were investigated for the project and 208 STs were excavated. Of
which only 16 were positive for cultural resources. It was expected that prehistoric and historic
sites could be found at the DB locations due to their locations above the Bois d’Arc Creek
floodplain as well as their proximity to ephemeral drainages. These DB locations are situated at
the leading edges of the Ambrose and Kansan terraces near the locations where other sites had
been previously recorded. Sites in these settings tend to be low-density artifacts concentrations in
shallow disturbed sandy sediments with no preserved organics. These sites typically do not contain
diagnostic artifacts and none of those recorded during this project or the sites nearby from the
previous investigation contain prehistoric ceramics. While historic sites were expected, none were
found near the old drainages or ranch roads, additionally the proposed impact areas are not
locations that would have been suitable for historic occupation and no structures were shown in
these locations on historic maps. Three prehistoric sites were recorded near DB8 and DB11, where
prehistoric sites had already been recorded. The artifacts recovered at these sites were originally
deposited on the surfaces of these old terraces and have worked their way into the sediments
through bioturbation and agricultural activities. Shovel testing along the RP corridors was also
consistent with the research design and previous investigations which suggested that the Bois
d’Arc Creek floodplain was filled with unstable and rapid sedimentation unfavorable for
prehistoric occupation (Mandel 2009:2). None of the shovel tests in these survey areas recovered
any artifacts. These RP corridors are situated along ephemeral intermittent drainages, some of
which have been historically straightened. Given the results of the survey, the proposed project
components will not have any impacts on NRHP or SAL eligible sites.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The archaeological survey of Riverby Ranch WRP was conducted in 2017. Three new prehistoric
archaeological sites were recorded. The purpose was to determine if the proposed impact areas
would affect any archaeological sites and to supplement existing site data in areas where previous
sites had been recorded by gathering enough information to make recommendations about their
eligibility for listing on the NRHP and as SALs. During this survey, ARC excavated 208 shovel
tests, of which 16 (8%) contained artifacts. Based upon the survey results, the following site
recommendations are made regarding determinations of eligibility for listing on the NRHP and as
SALs (Table 10). ARC recommends that the proposed project components of the breaching the
dike and the planting of seedlings in the riparian corridors will not impact any NRHP or SAL
eligible archaeological sites.
