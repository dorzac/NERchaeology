During February 23 and 24, 2011, Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of the City of
McAllen Public Utility (MPU), conducted an intensive non-collection archeological survey of the
proposed 27-inch diameter Highland sewer line in north McAllen, Hidalgo County, Texas. The proposed
sewer pipeline would generally parallel the east side of proposed sections of Bicentennial Boulevard
within a City of McAllen utility corridor. The proposed sewer pipeline is an additional component of the
McAllen North Wastewater Treatment Plant (NWWTP) improvement project funded by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF), Tier
III program, as administered by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). Augmented by
judgmental shovel testing, survey investigations discovered no archeological resources. Subsurface tests
revealed soils disturbed by previous surface and subsurface utility projects (e.g., fiber optic, water
distribution, and natural gas). Based on these data, as well as geologic and soil conditions that are not
conducive to the preservation of archeological deposits, it is the opinion of B&A that the easement for the
proposed Highland sewer line is unlikely to contain previously unidentified archeological historic
properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or sites warranting State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation (13
TAC 26.12). As such, B&A recommends that the project should be allowed to proceed as planned
without additional archeological investigations as the proposed construction would not affect any
archeological historic properties (pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1)) or SALs.

PROJECT TITLE: Intensive Archeological Survey of the Proposed Highland Sewer Line, City of
McAllen, Hidalgo County, Texas
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: On February 23 and 24, 2011, Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the
request of the City of McAllen Public Utility (MPU), conducted an intensive non-collection archeological
survey of the proposed 4,400-foot long 27-inch diameter Highland sewer line in north McAllen, Hidalgo
County, Texas. The MPU generally would construct the planned sewer line parallel to the east side of
proposed sections of Bicentennial Boulevard within an existing 200-foot wide City of McAllen utility
corridor. However, the proposed work area only would be 50 feet wide (or less depending upon existing
conditions) and limited to the eastern margins of the existing utility corridor. The overall Area of
Potential Effect (APE) for the project is approximately 4,400 feet long, 200 feet wide, extends an
estimated maximum depth of approximately 20 feet below the ground surface, and 20.2 acres in size
PROJECT LOCATION: The proposed project area is in north McAllen in south-central Hidalgo
County and mapped on the USGS 7.5-minute Edinburg, TX (2698-142) topographic quadrangle
PROJECT ACREAGE: Approximately 20.2 acres
DATES OF WORK: February 23 and 24, 2011
PURPOSE OF WORK: B&A assisted the project sponsor in their compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
PROJECT ARCHEOLOGIST: Joseph M. Sanchez
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 5900
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: A review of records available on the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) indicated that the proposed project
area is encompassed by the Louisiana–Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System National Register
District (NRD) (No. 95001284). An examination of the NRD nomination form and supporting
documentation at the THC indicated, however, that there is an error in the boundaries of the district
provided by TASA; the NRD is too broadly drawn. The proposed sewer line actually is within Hidalgo
County Water Improvement District (HCWID) No. 3.
COMMENTS: B&A recommends that the proposed construction of the Highland sewer line should be
allowed to proceed as planned without additional investigations, as the proposed construction would not
affect any archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1) or State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs) (as per criteria established in Chapter 26.8 of the Antiquities Code of Texas).

I NT R ODUC T I ON
During February 23 and 24, 2011 Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of the City of
McAllen Public Utility (MPU), conducted an intensive non-collection archeological survey of the
proposed 27-inch diameter Highland sewer line in north McAllen, Hidalgo County, Texas (Figures 1
and 2). The proposed sewer pipeline would generally parallel the east side of proposed sections of
Bicentennial Boulevard within an existing City of McAllen utility corridor. The proposed sewer pipeline
is an additional component of the McAllen North Wastewater Treatment Plant (NWWTP) improvement
project funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) through the Clean Water State
Revolving Fund (CWSRF), Tier III program, as administered by the Texas Water Development Board
(TWDB).
The proposed 27-inch diameter Highland sewer line would be approximately 4,400-foot long and
generally constructed parallel to the east side of proposed sections of Bicentennial Boulevard, within an
existing approximately 200-foot wide north-south trending City of McAllen utility corridor. However, the
proposed work area would be 50 feet wide (or less depending upon existing conditions) and limited to the
eastern margins of the utility corridor. Construction would utilize open trenching except at three proposed
bore locations where construction would utilize directional boring to avoid impacts to existing roads and
other infrastructure. Bore 1 would begin at the southern terminus of the APE east of Bicentennial
Boulevard on the south side of Nolana Loop and extend approximately 293 feet to the north side of
Nolana Loop (see Figure 2). Bores 2 and 3 would be occur in the northern end of the APE just south of
the northern terminus of the project at Industrial Drive: Bore 2 would be 332 feet long to avoid existing
buried utilities, including a high pressure gas line and Bore 3 would begin just north of Bore 2 and extend
northward for approximately 220 feet to avoid impacting a buried gas line and existing railroad tracks
(see Figure 2). As the proposed sewer line is a gravity line, vertical impacts would extend to a maximum
depth of approximately 20 feet below ground surface.
As the proposed construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas, the project is subject
to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code. This legislation requires that any political subdivision (e.g., City of McAllen) of the
State of Texas must identify potential State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) (13 TAC 26.8) through
survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs. Additionally, as the
proposed construction would be funded in part by the TWDB’s State Revolving Fund (SRF) Tier III
(federal funds) loan program, the project is subject to the provisions of the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between the TWDB and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Further, as the
TWDB’s SRF Tier III loan program includes federal funds, the project is also subject to Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act.
The intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources discovered within the
APE, evaluate their eligibility for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or SAL
designation and, if significant archeological resources were discovered, make recommendations for future
resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or further investigations. Survey

The project area is located in the lower Rio Grande Valley in Hidalgo County. This area lies within
Fenneman’s (1938) West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the Coastal Plain physiographic province.
Topographically, the valley exhibits generally flat alluvial and/or coastal relief. The City of McAllen
property on which the construction would occur has been extensively impacted by previous surface and
subsurface utilities (e.g., fiber optic cable, storm water drainage system, overhead electric lines, and water
distribution infrastructure such as underground irrigation pipes) and roadway construction (Figures 3
and 4). Land use adjacent to the project area is residential and commercial.
G E OL OG Y
The geology of the proposed project area primarily consists of the mid-Pleistocene age Beaumont
Formation, though there is a small area of the early Pleistocene age Lissie Formation, undivided. The
Lissie Formation, undivided, is dominantly clay, silt, sand, gravel, and caliche. In localized areas, the
formation is cemented with sandy caliche. Ground surface characteristics of the formation include
undrained depressions, stabilized northwest-trending dunes, and relict clay dunes. The Beaumont
Formation primarily consists of clay, silt, sand, gravel, and muds (Barnes 1976). Given the early to midPleistocene age of these formations, which predates known human occupation of Texas, they have little
potential to contain intact archeological material. B&A’s survey investigations discovered no stabilized
northwest-trending dunes or relict clay dunes within the proposed sewer line easement; given the
extensive level of previous surface and subsurface impacts within the existing 200-foot wide utility
corridor, such topography was not anticipated.
There is no recent (Holocene) alluvium mapped within in the proposed project area (Barnes 1976).
Regionally, such sediments have consistently been shown to have a potential for containing buried
archeological material,
SOI L S
Soil within the proposed project area consists of Hidalgo-Urban land complex, with 0 to 3 percent slopes.
Hidalgo series soils are loamy upland soils that developed in situ from loamy and clayey sediments. A
representative profile (saline and non-saline) exhibits two sandy clay loam A horizons from 0 to 43
centimeters below ground surface (cmbs) overlying two sandy clay loam B horizons from about 43 to 97
cmbs. The underlying clay loam C horizon extends from roughly 97 to 200 cmbs (Jacobs 1981).
There is a potential for these soils to contain shallowly buried archeological material if there is a surface
veneer of sandy loam overlying the clay loam. This is not anticipated though, because previous
agricultural activity (e.g., vegetation clearing and plowing for row crops), subsequent urban development,
and the existing buried utilities (e.g., fiber optic cable, overhead lines, and drainage infrastructure) has
extensively impacted or destroyed any archeological resources potentially located within the planned
construction area. Given these conditions, there is little potential to discover archeological resources
within the planned construction area that could provide new or important data.

The project area lies within the Tamaulipan biotic province as described by Blair (1950). Within this
province, Jahrsdoerfor and Leslie (1988) recognize several biotic communities. Alluvial soils support
dense riparian forests whereas drier uplands tend to be dominated by spiny shrubs and stunted trees (Blair
1950). The study area consists of a maintained irrigation line/canal and a City of McAllen utility ROW
supporting grasses and occasional trees.

B&A conducted a review of records available online from the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA) on January 12, 2011 to determine the presence or absence of previously recorded archeological
resources in or adjacent to the proposed project area. The online review indicated that there are no
previously recorded archeological sites within or immediately adjacent to the study area.
The background review indicated however that the proposed project area is encompassed by the
Louisiana–Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System National Register District (No. 95001284). The
historic period of significance associated with the district spans the first half (ca. 1900–1949) of the
twentieth century. In the available TASA data, the historic irrigation system currently is operated by the
Hidalgo County Irrigation District (HCID) No. 2. However, a review of the nomination form and
supporting documentation at the THC indicate that there is an error in the boundaries of the district
provided on the TASA; the National Register District is too broadly drawn. Based on these data, the
currently proposed project area is not within the National Register District and construction elements
would not, therefore, impact HCID No. 2.
Data provided from the Hidalgo County Water Improvement District (HCWID) No. 3 indicates that the
proposed project area is within its boundaries (Figure 5). The earliest water distribution infrastructure for
the HCWID No. 3 also dates to dates to the first half of the twentieth century. In the western margin of
the City of McAllen’s utility ROW is a HCWID No. 3 easement; the proposed 27-inch sewer line would
be constructed parallel to the HCWID No. 3 easement in the eastern margin of the utility ROW. The
planned sewer line would only cross (via directional bores) the existing HCWID No. 3 drainage/irrigation
easement at the north end of the proposed project where it turns west to terminate at Industrial Drive (see
Figures 1 and 2). Given these data, it is B&A’s opinion that none of the infrastructure associated with
HCWID No. 3 would not be physically affected by the planned construction and, as the proposed sewer
line would be buried, there also would no permanent visual impacts.

B&A conducted an intensive survey of the project areas with surface and subsurface investigations as
necessary based on field conditions, in accordance with an appropriate research design (developed
pursuant to 13 TAC 26.21(d)). Investigations complied with appropriate archeological survey methods as
defined in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the
Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.), and pursuant to 13 TAC 26.20. All field investigations were
thoroughly photo-documented with digital cameras. Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent
pedestrian inspection of the ground surface within the proposed 50-foot wide construction area (as well as
adjacent areas visible from the existing utility ROW) utilizing a five-meter wide transect interval.
Investigations observed no intact cutbanks or road cuts available for inspection.
Survey standards established by THC (n.d.) and CTA (1987) for linear project areas require that surface
surveys be augmented by shovel testing (e.g., six shovel tests per mile or one shovel test every 330 feet)
in locations where surface visibility falls below 30 percent. However, given the urban project setting
within an existing disturbed utility ROW, B&A augmented surface examinations with judgmental shovel
testing, as necessary based on field conditions. Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters in diameter or 40
centimeters by 40 centimeters and excavated with a standard rounded or square-head shovel in arbitrary
20-centimeter levels. Excavations attempted to reach a depth of 100 centimeters below ground surface
unless soil characteristics (e.g., compact matrix that cannot feasibly be excavated by hand or exhibits
evidence of disturbance) or bedrock prohibited further excavation. All removed soil was screened through
0.25 inch wire mesh for artifact recovery.
Based on the density of existing subsurface utilities, the associated disturbances from utility construction,
and geologic and existing soil conditions, backhoe trenching was not warranted.

Intensive archeological survey investigations for the proposed Highland sewer line discovered no
archeological resources, nor did it discover any non-archeological resources that would be affected by the
proposed sewer line (Figures 6.1 and 6.2). Investigations revealed that the APE has been significantly
impacted by historic and modern land use and urban development. Previous impacts to the existing utility
ROW and proposed 50-foot wide sewer line easement include a drainage/irrigation canal, open ditches,
culverts, commercial and residential property development, roadway and railway construction, as well as
various overhead and underground utilities. As previously described, construction would utilize
directional bores to avoid existing infrastructure (e.g., Nolana Loop and a segment of the existing
drainage/irrigation canal and railroad tracks south of Industrial Road) (Figures 7, 8 and see Figure 6.2).
Surface visibility throughout the APE ranged from 0-100%, with the lowest visibility found in developed
areas with maintained landscaping, drainage ditches, and sidewalks (Figure 9). Soils in many parts of the
proposed easement are predominately reddish-brown clays dredged from the adjacent canal during regular
maintenance and re-deposited along the sides of the canal and on adjacent areas (Figure 10).
Subsurface investigations consisted of the judgmental excavation of six shovel tests (STs 1 through 6).
Excavations extended to a maximum depth of 75 centimeters below ground surface (Table 1). B&A
discovered presumably intact soil from 35 to 75 centimeters below ground surface only in ST 1, which
was located on the eastern edge of the utility ROW and sewer easement in a slightly elevated area. ST 1
exhibited clay loam over sandy loam that in turn overlays sandy clay. STs 2 through 6 contained reddishbrown clay dredged from an irrigation line/canal that parallels much of the planned easement.

Given the degree to which the existing utility ROW (including the proposed sewer line easement) has

previously unidentified archeological material.

Intensive archeological survey of the proposed Highland sewer line discovered no archeological resources
or non-archeological historic resources that would be impacted by the planned sewer line. None of the
existing infrastructure associated with HCWID No. 3 that the planned sewer line easement parallels
would be impacted by the proposed construction. Shovel testing within the proposed construction area
discovered virtually no intact sediments within the existing utility ROW, including the proposed 50-foot
wide construction area. Subsurface testing typically exhibited reddish-brown clay dredged from the
irrigation/drainage canal west of, and parallel to, the proposed sewer line easement. Further, geologic and
soil conditions of the project area, as well as surface and subsurface impacts to the APE from historic and
current land use, are not conducive for the preservation of intact archeological deposits. Additionally,
Based on the above data, it is the opinion of B&A that the Highland sewer line is unlikely to contain
previously unidentified archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or sites warranting SAL
designation (13 TAC 26.12). Further, it also is the opinion of B&A that none of the infrastructure
associated with HCWID No. 3 would be physically affected by the planned construction and, as the
proposed sewer line would be buried, there would be no permanent visual impacts. As such, B&A
recommends that the project should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional investigations as
the proposed construction would not affect any archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR
800.4(d)(1) or SALs.
If it is determined that the City of McAllen requires additional easements or work space, then additional
archeological investigations in those locations would be necessary. In the event that previously
unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area of
discovery should cease and the THC will be contacted to coordinate accidental discovery procedures.
