Abstract
The skeleton of a human adult female was excavated from alluvial sediments along the Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas. She was buried face
down in an extended position with her hands crossed beneath the waist. Initial radiocarbon ages indicated that this skeleton dated to the late
Pleistocene. Geoarchaeological and archaeological excavations at the site, coupled with new radiocarbon ages, amino acid compositional
data, and an analysis of the previously reported radiocarbon ages obtained from the skeleton instead suggest a middle Holocene age for this
burial.

1. Introduction
At 41BO223 (also known as BZT-1), an archaeological
site on the San Bernard Wildlife Refuge, Brazoria County,
Texas, d’Aigle and Hryshechko (2002, 2003) reported the
discovery of a human skeleton that they believe dated to
the late Pleistocene. This discovery led to further archaeological and geoarchaeological investigations at this site and another nearby site designated 41BO215 (also known as BZT-2)
(d’Aigle and Hryshechko, 2002) in May 2003. This new
work was undertaken to define and correlate the stratigraphy
at 41BO223 and 41BO215; date the stratigraphic sequence;
determine the stratigraphic position of the human skeleton
from 41BO223; determine the stratigraphic position of the
shell midden at 41BO215; excavate, conserve, and analyze
the skeleton at 41BO223; and determine the geological age

of the skeleton. This paper presents the results of this
investigation.
2. Background and history of archaeological
investigations
The human skeletal remains found at 41BO223 were
discovered by personnel of the Fish and Wildlife Services
on the San Bernard Wildlife Refuge, Brazoria County, Texas,
after the excavation of a drainage ditch in April 1999. Exposed
in the sidewall of the ditch were fragments of the upper
portion of a human skull. CRC, International Archaeology &
Ecology was contracted to conduct an exploratory investigation of the remains (d’Aigle and Hryshechko, 2002). CRC personnel spent five days examining the site in the field in May
and July 2001. During this time, the skull, mandible, and
a few other bones were removed. In addition, a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey of the area was undertaken to prospect for other possible human remains at the site. Geological
studies, which included backhoe trenching and coring, were
undertaken by two geologists, Howell and Moya (2002).

Numerous analyses were conducted on the human bones and
subsequent studies were made on sediments collected from
the site. These analyses included: radiocarbon dating of four
samples, the analysis of sediment and bone samples for
ancient DNA, the analysis of sediment samples for human protein residues, the analysis of soil and sediment samples for texture and chemical composition, stable carbon isotope analysis
of a tooth, and the examination of the human remains (d’Aigle
and Hryshechko, 2002). In addition, d’Aigle and Hryshechko
(2002) examined a shell midden (41BO215) located 66 m
southwest of 41BO223.
Based on the field work and laboratory analyses, d’Aigle
and Hryshechko (2002, 2003) confirmed that the remains
were human and suggested that the skeleton may have been
oriented in a vertical position. A GPR survey indicated no
anomalies in the immediate or adjacent areas and this suggested that no other human remains were present. Also, an
analysis of the GPR data indicated no evidence of a burial
shaft associated with the known human remains. d’Aigle and
Hryshechko (2002, 2003) concluded that the skeleton was articulated, and based on the presence of human protein in the
soil surrounding the skull, that the body had decomposed in
place. Analysis of the skeletal remains recovered from the
site indicated that they were from a female, approximately
20e30 years of age. No artifacts or other remains were found
with the bones and thus no cultural affiliation could be determined. Stable carbon isotope analyses of a tooth fragment
suggested that she may have been a resident of the Texas
Gulf Coast with marine resources as part of her diet (Tykot,
2002). However, the stable carbon isotope value for the dated
petrosal suggested that ‘‘this person was not from the Gulf
Coast region and was instead from an inland, tropical region
significantly distant geographically from the ocean . not
from the continental United States’’ (d’Aigle and Hryshechko,
2002:96). The minimum geologic age of the skeleton, was reported as 10,740 ? 760 14C yr BP (AA-45910) (d’Aigle and
Hryshechko, 2002, 2003).
The investigations reported here took place in May 2003.
At 41BO223, the archaeologically sterile sediments overlying
the burial were removed to 50 cm above the highest elevation
of the skull. The remaining sediments were hand excavated
and all sediments were screened through 1/8 inch mesh. Excavation was difficult because of a high water table and pumps
were used to keep water from the excavation area. Once the
remains were uncovered, it was determined that they were
too fragile to remove as individual elements. Many of the
bones were crushed and broken by the weight of the overlying
sediments, and by the expansion and contraction of the enclosing clay matrix. To enhance the recovery and preservation of
individual skeletal elements, the entire skeleton was pedestaled and wrapped in a hard protective plaster jacket and
removed for excavation in the laboratory. At 41BO215,
trenches were excavated to examine the stratigraphy and collect radiocarbon samples. At both 41BO223 and 41BO215,
the geological stratigraphy was recorded and described. The
plaster jacket containing the skeleton was taken to the Physical
Anthropology Laboratory at Texas A&M University where it

was opened and carefully excavated. Samples of some bones
were removed for radiocarbon dating and amino acid compositional analysis. The remaining bones were stabilized with
polyvinyl acetate (PVA). Excavated sediments were screened
and the bones reconstructed and analyzed. The human remains
are now curated at The Center for Archaeological Research,
University of Texas, San Antonio.
In 2004, additional studies at 41BO223 and 41BO215 were
undertaken (d’Aigle et al., 2005). Based on this additional
fieldwork, additional studies, and an independent analysis of
the May 2003 excavation data, d’Aigle et al. (2005) reported
confirmation of a late Pleistocene age for the skeleton.
The information and interpretations presented in this paper
represents only the views of Waters, Wiersema, and Stafford.
For additional information and an alternative interpretation of
these sites see d’Aigle and Hryshechko (2002, 2003) and d’Aigle, et al. (2005).
3. Physiographic setting of 41BO223 and 41BO215
Both 41BO223 and 41BO215 occur in the lower portion of
the western Gulf Coastal Plain about 7.5 km inland from the
Gulf of Mexico (Fig. 1). The area is part of the fluvial deltaic
system associated with the Brazos River and San Bernard
River (Abbott, 2001; Anderson et al., 2004; Aten, 1983).
This area is considered part of the subaerial deltaic plain
that is frequently covered by floodwaters that overflow small
channels draining to the Gulf of Mexico. Previous work determined that both sites lie on the western edge of an abandoned
and intermittent fluvial channel, likely related to Cocklebur
Slough (d’Aigle and Hryshechko, 2002).
4. Stratigraphy and geochronology of 41BO223 and
41BO215
The stratigraphy and geochronology of 41BO223 and
41BO215 are very similar. Both consist of two fine-grained
alluvial units that have been affected by pedogenesis.
The stratigraphy at 41BO223 consists of two fine-grained
alluvial units (Fig. 2). Unit 1 consists of silty clay and ranges
from 115 to 145 cm below the surface. No primary sedimentary structures are present and the fine-grained sediments
have been altered by pedogenesis and bioturbation. The upper
25 cm have been altered into a dark gray, granular, Bt horizon.
Below this horizon lies a transitional soil BC horizon of brown
silty clay. No A horizon is present, indicating that the top of
this unit was truncated after soil formation.
Unit 1 contained the human remains. This skeleton rests entirely within the Bt horizon approximately 1 cm above the BC
horizon. The skeleton lies no more than 0.5 m above sea level.
In addition, terrestrial, freshwater, and marine shells and lithic
artifacts (two pieces of debitage) were found within the Bt horizon of this unit. Non-human animal bones, mostly small
mammals and a few large mammals (Cervidae family), were
recovered from the Bt horizon. Seven fragments of Cervidae
bones, two fragments of unidentified medium-size mammal,
and one fragment of unidentified large-size mammal from the

Bt horizon were calcined. Two radiocarbon dates (Table 1)
were obtained on the humic acids extracted from this horizon
(d’Aigle and Hryshechko, 2002). These humic acids dated to
4870 ? 40 14C yr BP (CAMS-87686) and 5135 ? 40 14C yr
BP (CAMS-87685). A new radiocarbon date on a single marine
Rangia cuneata yielded an age of 5590 ? 40 14C yr BP
(CAMS-101892). Two additional ages were obtained directly
from the human skeleton (d’Aigle and Hryshechko, 2002):
8700 ? 2300 14C yr BP (AA-45909) on human teeth and
10,740 ? 760 14C yr BP (AA-45910) on bone (a Petrosal).
The late Pleistocene ages on the bone contrast with the middle
Holocene humate and shell carbonate dates. Samples from the
femur, tibia, and humerus obtained during the 2003 investigations were submitted to Stafford Research Laboratories for
radiocarbon dating. These samples could not be dated because
the bones contained no indigenous protein (collagen).
Unit 2 consists of silty clay and ranges from the surface to
a depth of 115 cm. The upper portion of these sediments have
been altered by pedogenic processes with a thin A horizon,
a dark gray Bt horizon with subangular blocky structure, a transitional BC horizon, followed by unaltered brown silty clay.
This unit rests unconformably on Unit 1. No radiocarbon dates
were obtained from Unit 2.
The stratigraphy of 41BO215 consists of two fine-grained
alluvial units similar to those found at 41BO223 (Fig. 2).
Unit 1 consists of a silty clay and ranges from 130 to at least
180 cm below the surface. No sedimentary structures are

present and these fine-grained deposits are pedogenically
altered. The upper 20e35 cm have been altered into a dark
gray Bt horizon with granular structure. Below this lies a transitional BC horizon of silty clay. The top of this unit was truncated after soil formation. This is evidenced by the absence of
an A horizon and the variable thickness of the Bt horizon.
A small shell midden, about 3e4 m in diameter, occurs at the
very base of the Bt horizon. Rangia shells dominate the midden.
A few non-human animal bones and sparse lithics were also
found. A single Rangia from the midden (Table 1) yielded a radiocarbon date of 5585 ? 40 14C yr BP (CAMS-94573). This is
the only radiocarbon date obtained from the site.
Unit 2 overlies Unit 1. Unit 2 consists primarily of silty
clay that ranges from the surface to a depth of 130 cm. The upper portion of these sediments have been altered by pedogenic
processes and comprise a thin A horizon, followed by several
dark gray B and Bt horizons with prismatic structure. This is
followed by a transitional BC horizon that is yellowish brown,
followed by the C horizon of unaltered sediment. No ages
were obtained from this unit.
5. Correlation and depositional history
The proximity of 41BO223 and 41BO215 and their nearly
identical stratigraphy, indicate that the two sequences can
be correlated with one another (Fig. 2). The sequence of sediments is the same. Both are fine-grained deposits separated by

coincidental with deposition. This was followed by a period
of erosion in which the top of the soil was truncated. This
was then followed by renewed overbank flooding and the vertical accretion of additional fine-grained sediments. This fluvial activity may be associated with the channel defined by
d’Aigle and Hryshechko (2002).
6. The human skeleton

skeleton, shell midden, all radiocarbon dates, and proposed correlations.

A nearly complete, but fragmented skeleton was recovered
over the course of two separate archaeological excavations
(Figs. 3 and 4; Table 2). During excavations in 2001, fragments of the skull, mandible, teeth, two cervical vertebrae,
and a clavicle were recovered (d’Aigle and Hryshechko,
2002). During the 2003 excavations, the remainder of the skeleton was recovered.
The majority of the elements of the skeleton were in
roughly anatomical position. However, the bones of the lower
right leg and foot, with the exception of the right talus, were
missing (Figs. 3 and 4). The absence of these particular elements is likely the result of post-burial disturbance processes
such as prehistoric or historic excavations (e.g., pit excavation)
at the site and/or dispersal by crayfish burrowing because fragments of the fibula and tibia were found in the sediments

an unconformity. Furthermore, the degree of pedogenesis and
sequence of soil formation at both sites is nearly identical. Finally, the ages from the lower unit (Unit 1) at both localities
are similar with the exception of the bone dates. Based on
these lines of evidence, it is clear that the sequences at these
two sites can be correlated.
The sequence, as represented at both 41BO223 and
41BO215, indicates deposition in a subaerial fluvial environment. Unit 1 was created by overbank flooding when silts
and clays were deposited. The floodplain built vertically and
pedogenesis followed either during a period of stability or

above the skeleton. The scapulae, sternum, and hand and foot
bones were also absent. Their absence is likely the result of
postmortem degradation and bioturbation.
The skeletal remains are highly fragmented and physically
and chemically degraded. This is the result of postmortem expansion and contraction of the clay in which the remains were
embedded, the weight of the overlying sediment, and the fact
that the skeleton lay in the zone of a fluctuating water table.
Only a few areas of rodent gnawing were noted on the bones
and there was no evidence of scavenging by other animals.
Root etching was noted on only a few skeletal elements, resulting in only minor damage to the bone surfaces.
7. Mortuary characteristics
Upon initial excavation in 1999, the arrangement of the cranial remains and their particular association with the upper
cervical spine, led Steele (2002) to suggest that the
41BO223 remains may have been oriented in an upright burial
position, perhaps with legs flexed. Upon excavation of the
remainder of the skeleton in May 2003, however, it became
evident that the remains were instead oriented roughly
northesouth (head to south, feet to north) in an extended, horizontal, face-down position, with hands crossed beneath the pelvis (Figs. 3 and 4). These and other characteristics of the burial
arrangement indicate a deliberate interment. Additional features indicating a deliberate burial are its horizontal position

and the close proximity of the extremities to both one another
and each to the trunk. It is possible that the body was wrapped
prior to burial to maintain this posture, although no evidence
of this was recovered during excavation. The upright position
of the cranial remains, as well as their orientation relative to
the cervical spine as noted by Steele (2002), may be the result
of the body being placed into a burial pit of insufficient length.
The head may have twisted as it came into contact with the
cranial boundary of the burial pit. Alternatively, the head
may have been deliberately placed in that position.
8. Biological characteristics
The skeleton appears to be that of an adult female. Sex estimation was made largely on the basis of pelvic morphology,
with supportive evidence from the remainder of the skeleton.
Female indicators include the very wide and shallow left and
right greater sciatic notches of the pelvis, a small pre-auricular
sulcus on the right innominate, and the degree of rugosity of
the auricular surface of the right innominate.
The overall muscularity of the skull, namely of the mastoid
and occipital areas, were consistent with female. The profile of
the frontal bone of the skull was upright, the extent of gonial
eversion present on the fragment of the mandible was minimal,
and the supra-orbital margin was fairly narrow and sharp.
Measurement of the maximum femoral head diameter yielded
a value considerably below the threshold for distinction
between males and females (Stewart, 1979). These individual
characters are all supported by the relatively small size and
nominal muscularity of the remains as a whole.
As indicated by the complete fusion of all of the available
epiphyses in the skeleton, the 41BO223 remains are those of
an adult. Few elements were available to narrow the age range.
The sternal rib ends and the pubic symphysis for example, sustained sufficient postmortem damage to preclude their use in
age estimation. The right auricular surface, however, was

2430

M.R. Waters et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 2425e2433

carefully extracted from the fragmented remains of the pelvis.
Employment of the technique devised by Lovejoy et al. (1985)
for age estimation from the auricular surface resulted in the
classification of the 41BO223 remains into phase two. According to Lovejoy et al. (1985), this stage of degeneration is typical of individuals between the ages of 25 and 29. The lack of
degenerative changes to other joint surfaces also supports the
notion that the 41BO223 remains are those of a young adult
within this age range. The extent of occlusal dental wear apparent on the dentition, though severe, is consistent with other
central and southeast Texas Archaic skeletal remains of the
same approximate age (Collins, 1998). The degree of wear
was greater on the premolars and the 1st molar than on the
2nd molar. This may be the result of more lengthy exposure
to abrasive agents due to their earlier eruption. The 3rd molar
showed little or no signs of wear in contrast to the remainder
of the dentition. A reasonable age estimate of the individual,
based collectively on all indicators, is between 20 and
30 years.
The size and stature of the 41BO223 skeleton is, even upon
cursory visual inspection, very small. Reliable estimation of the
stature of the individual was made difficult by the fragmentary
condition of the bones. A stature estimate of 147.3 ? 5.2 cm
was estimated using measurements of the nearly complete
left femur and Genovese’s (1967) stature estimation formula.
The skeletal material generally lacked osteopathologies
with the exception of areas of porotic hyperostosis lesions
and minimal thickening of portions of the frontal bone of
the skull. The appearance of the lesions is indicative of an individual who underwent an episode of iron-deficient anemia as
a child, a period of time sufficient to result in the proliferation
of marrow cavities within the diploe of cranial bones (StuartMacAdam, 1989).
A large number of the teeth showed signs of extensive
use-wear. In spite of the extensive wear to each of the teeth,
little resorption into the alveolar bone was noted and suggests that the individual likely maintained much of her adult
dentition at the time of her death. The wear to the 1st and
2nd left maxillary premolars and the left 1st and 2nd
maxillary molars was sufficient to completely penetrate
the enamel and expose the underlying dentin. There did appear to be caries in the crown of at least one tooth. Steele
(2002) reports that no evidence of hyperplasia was observed
on the teeth.
9. Geological age of the skeleton
d’Aigle and Hryshechko (2002, 2003) and d’Aigle et al.
(2005) report that the human remains from 41BO223 date to
the late Pleistocene. This is based primarily on two radiocarbon ages obtained from the NSF-Arizona AMS Facility at
the University of Arizona. Human teeth yielded an age of
8700 ? 2300 14C yr BP (AA-45909) and a human petrosal
yielded a date of 10,740 ? 760 14C yr BP (AA-45910).
As already established in a previous section, the skeleton
occurred within the lower portion of the Bt horizon associated
with Unit 1. Ages on sediment humic acids derived from the

Bt horizon, as well as the shell carbonate fraction of a Rangia
cuneata shell from this horizon, range from approximately
5000 to 5600 14C yr BP (Table 1). These dates are similar to
the age of ca. 5600 14C yr BP obtained from the shell midden
(41BO215) in a similar stratigraphic context 66 m southwest
of the burial. Clearly, the humate and shell ages are significantly younger than the dates derived on bone from the skeleton. The shell and humate dates suggest a middle Holocene
age for the skeleton, while the direct bone dates suggest a significantly older, late Pleistocene or early Holocene age. Because different ages have been determined by using different
materials for radiocarbon dating, AMS 14C dates on bone versus the radiocarbon ages on sediments and shell, it is necessary
to discuss the AMS radiocarbon results in greater detail.
The first consideration is the chemical or protein composition of the bones. As later determined by Stafford, the petrosal
dated by the NSF-Arizona AMS Facility had a non-collagenous
amino acid composition (Table 3); that is, relative proportions
of aspartic and glutamic acids are elevated, hydroxyproline is
absent, and glycine is reduced relative to modern bone collagen. A second petrosal sent to Stafford Research Laboratories
also had a non-collagenous amino acid composition (Table 3)
and accordingly was not dated. A non-collagenous amino
acid composition can result from at least three different geochemical pathways: (1) the degradation of collagen whereby

Values are expressed in residues per thousand (R/1000). Protein content is
expressed as nanomoles of amino acids per milligram of bone (nm AA/mg
bone). Bone with <100 nm AA/mg bone is considered not dateable by current
methods. The five amino acids marked with an asterisk (*) are those most
important for assessing protein degradation, i.e., is the protein composition
collagenous or non-collagenous.

M.R. Waters et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 2425e2433

amino acids are differentially leached from the bone, (2) the
amino acids are derived from bacterial and other foreign biological materials that have a similar, non-collagenous amino
acid composition, or (3) a combination of both collagenderived and bacteria-derived proteins and amino acid residues
are present in the bone. Three additional samples obtained in
May 2003 from the femur, tibia, and humerus were also analyzed at Stafford Research Laboratories. Again, the amino
acid assays showed a non-collagenous composition of the organic matter (Table 4). The amino acid composition data are
an indication that the amino acid spectrum of the bone organic
matter is not that of collagen and that dating this type of bone
would yield inaccurate ages (Stafford et al., 1991). As a result,
it is very unlikely that accurate ages would result from direct
dating of the Brazoria skeleton.
Second, the samples that were prepared and eventually
dated by the NSF-Arizona AMS Facility were extremely small
and the bones’ carbon yields were equally low. The teeth
yielded 5 mg of ‘‘organic’’ carbon, while the petrosal yielded
40 mg of ‘‘organic’’ carbon. Minimum sample size for accurate
dating is considered to be 100 mg of carbon. More detailed
amino acid analyses of both petrosals (Table 3) indicated the
presence of 1.9e2.3 nm of amino acids/mg, a value that is

Values are expressed in residues per 1000 (R/1000). Protein content is
expressed as nanomoles of amino acids per milligram of bone (nm AA/mg
bone). Bones with <100 nm AA/mg bone are considered not dateable by current
methods. The five amino acids marked with an asterisk (*) are those most important for assessing protein degradation, i.e., is the protein composition collagenous or non-collagenous.

2500 nm of amino acids/mg of bone (Stafford et al., 1991).
Bone and teeth that contain less than 100 nm amino acids/
mg of sample are not dateable by existing 14C methods. Samples from the tibia, humerus, and femur that were sent to Stafford Research Laboratories yielded similar, very low amino
acid contents (Table 4). The tibia, humerus, and femur contained 1e2 nm of amino acids per mg of bone. In this case,
the amino acid content is two orders of magnitude below the
100 nm/mg threshold needed for accurate dating.
Third, samples yielding less than 0.05 mg (50 mg) of carbon
are difficult to date accurately because geological and laboratory contaminations have proportionately greater effect on the
measurement’s accuracy while measurement precision becomes
increasingly large. The two Arizona AMS 14C dates could
have been contaminated by carbon with low 14C/12C ratios,
that is carbon with a fraction of modern 14C values (Fm)
that would normally occur in samples over 10,000 14C years
old. The carbon that may have contaminated the Arizona samples could have been derived from at least two sources: (1)
from sediments contributing low 14C content organic matter
derived from reworked Cretaceous or Tertiary sediments or
(2) laboratory contamination from reagents or chemicals
used during pretreatment or graphitization. In each case, the
contaminant would have small Fm values and have ‘‘apparent’’ 14C ages of 10,000 to greater than 55,000 yr BP. The
41BO223 samples yielded 5 mg and 40 mg of carbon. If onehalf or more of the final carbon converted into graphite was
ancient carbon with a Fm <0.002, the measured age of this
combined carbon would be 8000e11,000 14C yr BP.
Sediment-derived older carbon is an unlikely contaminant
for two reasons. First, the organic matter would have to be
chemically similar to the fraction dated. Particulate plant organic matter, kerogen or other refractory and geologically
ancient (>50,000 yr BP) carbon would have been eliminated
during the chemical purification steps. These types of organic
compounds would have been excluded chemically from amino
acids that were dated. Second, the contaminants most likely to
have affected the tooth and petrosal dates are humic or fulvic
acids, predominately the latter. However, ancient humates do
not appear to be present in the sediments enclosing the bones
because sedimentary humic acids yielded ages of ca. 4900e
5100 14C yr BP (d’Aigle and Hryshechko, 2002) (Table 1).
Consequently, it is unlikely that sediment-derived, ancient carbon contaminated the teeth and petrosal samples.
Inherent problems in measuring the concentrations of carbon isotopes in very small samples also resulted in the large
standard deviations associated with the two ages generated
by the NSF-Arizona AMS Facility. One has a one-sigma error
of 2300 years and the other 760 years. In fact, the tooth sample
has such a wide standard deviation that it could either date to
the late Pleistocene or to the middle Holocene, close to the
ages generated by the shell and humate samples.
The geologic context and invertebrate remains found at the
site also provide additional evidence relevant to determining
the age of the human remains from 41BO223. The human remains at the site were found within the lower portion of the Bt
horizon associated with Unit 1. These deposits can be correlated

2432

with those at 41BO215 where a shell midden was found in the
same stratigraphic position. A radiocarbon measurement on
Rangia cuneata shell carbonate from this site yielded a date
of ca. 5600 14C yr BP. This agrees well with the shell date
from 41BO223. Additionally, the late Pleistocene age for the
skeleton is discordant with the presence of a brackish water
Rangia cuneata within the Bt horizon of Unit 1 at both
41BO223 and 41BO215. During the late Pleistocene, sea level
would have been lower than today (ca. ?35 m at 11,000 14C yr
BP) and at least 30 km seaward of 41BO223 and 41BO215. It
seems unlikely that a shell midden would have been created
this far inland from its source during the late Pleistocene. It
seems more reasonable that the shell midden was created during the middle Holocene when sea level was much closer to its
present position and not a great distance from 41BO223 and
41BO215.
In summary, the 41BO223 Brazoria site’s human bones
have a non-collagenous amino acid composition, and less
than 1/1000th their original organic matter content. It is
unknown if this small amount of amino acids was derived
from the bones’ original collagen, but it is unlikely. Bone samples analyzed by the NSF-Arizona AMS Facility and others
sent to Stafford Research Laboratories all had similar, very
low organic matter contents and non-collagenous compositions. The collagen would have been destroyed by fluctuating,
oxidizing water tables, as indicated by the bones’ high ferric
iron and manganese contents.
The non-collagenous amino acid composition, the low organic matter content, and the microgram yields all preclude
the bones from yielding accurate radiocarbon or stable isotope
measurements. Finally, it is possible that the measured ages on
two 41BO223 human bones are too old because ancient carbon
was incorporated into the sample during laboratory processing.
In conclusion, we consider the ca. 10,740 14C yr BP date
for the human bones to be erroneously too old. Instead, an
age of ca. 5600 14C yr BP is postulated for the skeleton and
this conclusion is based on geology, 14C dates on shell from
41BO223 and humic acids enclosing the skeleton, and consideration of the regional paleoecology for the brackish water
mollusk Rangia.
10. Stable carbon isotope analyses
Two stable carbon isotope values derived from the skeleton
were reported by d’Aigle and Hryshechko (2002, 2003). These
were used to interpret the diet of the individual and provide
data on the origin of this person. One sample of tooth enamel
was analyzed by Tykot (2002). He obtained a value on the
enamel of ?10.5&. Tykot (2002:167) concluded that C4
plants contributed ‘‘25% of the diet at the time of crown formation.’’ He also concluded that ‘‘marine foods from the Gulf
contributed significantly to this individual’s diet.’’ Tykot
(2002:167) concludes that ‘‘the isotope result obtained on
this single tooth is consistent with residency along the Gulf
Coast.’’ It is interesting to note that the radiocarbon age obtained from the tooth, given the standard deviation, could
date to the middle Holocene.

A stable carbon isotope value of ?26.5& was obtained by
the NSF-Arizona AMS Facility on the petrosal organic carbon
dated as 10,740 ? 760 14C yr BP (AA-45910). Tykot (2002)
noted that this value was not consistent with the isotope value
obtained from the tooth. Tykot (2002:167) comments, ‘‘. if
done on a sample of intact collagen . [the stable carbon isotope value] . is not consistent with any marine food or C4
resource consumption, and suggests residence in an environment in which there was no free circulation of atmospheric
carbon dioxide such as under the canopy of a tropical forest.’’
d’Aigle and Hryshechko (2002:171) based on the petrosal’s
isotope value, concluded that ‘‘this person was not from the
Gulf Coast region and was instead from an inland, tropical
region significantly distant geographically from the ocean.’’
d’Aigle and Hryshechko (2002:96) believe the tooth enamel
specimen was less reliable for such analyses because they
felt for various reasons that the tooth was likely more ‘‘degraded than it appears.’’
The amino acid analyses showing that the petrosals and
other human bone from 41BO223 had a non-collagenous
amino acid spectrum, cast doubt on the validity of the stable
carbon isotope measurements on the petrosals. Interestingly, it
may be the tooth that yielded the most accurate measurement,
both in 14C and stable isotopes. Tykot (2002) concluded that marine foods were an important part of the individuals diet. This
finding is consistent with the presence of Rangia at 41BO223,
the close proximity of the shell midden at 41BO215 in correlative
deposits, and with the proposed middle Holocene age for the
skeleton.
11. Summary
The nearly complete, but fragmentary human skeleton of
a young adult female was recovered from 41BO223 in Brazoria
County, Texas. This person, was intentionally buried. The skeleton was lying in a face-down extended position with hands
crossed beneath the waist. No preserved grave goods were
found with the burial. Analysis of the previous radiocarbon
dates obtained from the skeleton as well as new radiocarbon
dates and amino acid composition results suggest that the
skeleton likley dates to about 5600 yr B.P. Two characteristics
ally the burial from Brazoria County with the middle Archaic
burial sites in southeastern Texas (Hall, 1981, 1995; Taylor,
1995). The first is the dearth of burial goods associated with
the remains and the second is the extended position of the
remains. The burial appears to be unusual in its mortuary characteristics relative to its Archaic contemporaries in that the
skeleton was buried face down with hands neatly crossed
beneath the pelvic area.
