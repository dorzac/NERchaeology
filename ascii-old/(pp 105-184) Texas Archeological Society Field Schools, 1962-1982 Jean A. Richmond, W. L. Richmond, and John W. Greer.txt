ABSTRACT
TAS field schools have grown from a small group of TAS members gathered fora
summer dig to a highly organized educational activity for avocational and vocational
archeologists. We have attempted to trace this development, presenting the philosophy
behind, and the goals for, the annual field schools. The descriptions of 21 field schools
at 19 different locations include brief summaries of archeological accomplishments
and field school activities.

INTRODUCTION
The 1982 Texas Archeological Society (TAS) annual field school at
Rowe Valley marked the twentieth anniversary of the collaboration of Texas
archeologists--vocational and avocational--for the improvement of archeological practices and recovery of archeological information.
Our original intent was to focus on 20years of specific contributions that
the TAS field school has made to Texas archeology. As we examined source
materials, it became evident that detailed archeological information was
available for only a few field schools. As a result, we elected to expand the
scope of the article to include details of field school development and training
in archeological skills. Briefly stated, we have attempted to: (I) present the
specific contributions of TAS field schools to the archeological data pool for
Texas; (2) outline the structural development for a hands-on training
program in archeology and archeologically related areas; and (3) trace the
growth of the TAS field school in education and information dissemination.
The authors have long been interested in, and participants at, the field
schools, and it was difficult to exclude many items of personal interest;
however, it was felt that anecdotal accounts, for the most part, are best
included in the newsletter.

Texas Archeological Society
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT
"ANNOUNCING: A SUMMER DIG IN WHICH
YOU CAN PARTICIPATE

When this invitation to Texas Archeological Society members appeared in
1962 in Texas Archeology 6(1), neither the organizers of the "dig," the
sponsors (the Texas Archeological Society, the Dallas Archeological Society,
and the University of Texas in Austin), nor the members of TAS who sent in
their applications realized that they were establishing the basis for one of the
outstanding programs in Texas archeology--the Texas Archeological Society
Annual Field School.
The early field schools were occasions for a group of people who shared
an interest in archeology to get together for a dig and to socialize. The dig
provided an opportunity to learn a little about archeological methods, but
mostly it was an opportunity to help excavate a site that was archeologically
exciting, a chance to recover and handle archeological remains, and a chance
to share experiences and perhaps exchange archeological information about
work being done in various parts of the state. It was a vacation from the
workaday world for most of the participants. And, it was a chance to
contribute in a small way to the science of archeology.
As reported in Texas Archeology 6(3), 1962, the "first T.A.S. excavation
project" was a "smashing success socially as well as archeologically." Ed
Jelks, director of the dig, reported at the TAS Annual Meeting, November 2,
1962, on the "first field school held for TAS members" at the Gilbert site in
Rains County (Figure 1). TAS members were enthusiastic, and a motion was
made and carried that another field school be sponsored by the society, a host
institution, and the university. It was also decided that a director would be
appointed from the staff of the university to arrange for the site and the loca!
(cooperating) group, and to make other necessary arrangements.

Administrative Structure
At the time of the inception of the field school in 1962, there were no
provisions in the Texas Archeologica! Society Constitution and By-Laws for
sponsored activities. Nevertheless, the program continued and in April 1963
plans for the "Second Annual Texas Archeological Society Summer Field
School" were announced in Texas Archeology 7(1). In 1964 the board of
directors voted to conduct a third field school.
The director for the 1962 and 1963 field schools was the archeologist who
had volunteered to be in charge of the dig. By 1964 it was evident that the
professional archeologist could not both direct the field school and attend to
the many incidental problems associated with running a field camp. At the
October 1964 TAS board meeting, Ed Jelks was appointed chairman of the
new three-person field school committee, which was given the responsibility
of choosing a field school director and making all necessary arrangements for
the project.
In December 1964 the board of directors approved a suggestion by Isabel
Lobdel that the approach to the summer dig should be that of a school rather
than a project. At the same time, it was decided the best time for the school
would be two weeks in the middle of June.

Texas Archeological Society

It was recognized that the annual field school had become part of the
societyâs regular activities, and, at the November 1965 annual meeting, the
Texas Archeological Society Constitution and By-Laws were amended to
include under Article I: Membership and Dues, the privilege of attending and
participating in the summer field school. The following provision (Article VI:
Field School) was added to the by-laws: "A field school may be conducted
when practicable, to train members of the Society in disciplined archeological
techniques. The time, place, duration, and administration of the field school
shall be at the discretion of the Field School Director, who will be appointed
by the President."
Members attending the field schools recognized that logistical problems
existed in the operation of the school and the camp. At the October t966
board meeting, Nancy McClurkan (who had experience in management and
public relations and had assisted at the 1966 field school in West Texas)
presented a report on analysis and structure of TAS field schools with specific
suggestions for future operations. On the basis of her report it was decided
that, in addition to the field school director, a camp director should be
appointed to take charge of setting up and running the camp. It was also
recommended that a general camp mess, using professional cooks instead of
volunteers, be established. Other suggested improvements included the
following: (1) that a good curriculum for the field school be established well in
advance of the session; (2) that performance evaluations of participants be
made by crew chiefs; (3) that a strong field school structure be devised to
ensure a smooth transition from one TAS administration to another; and (4)
that registration forms contain a list of personal equipment that each
participant should provide. It was suggested that field school costs be covered
by an increase in registration fees. The majority of these suggestions were
received favorably, and the budgetary field school allotment was increased
from $100 to $200.
Increases in field school registration and meal costs were the result of a
formal move in 1968 to make the field school self-supporting. It was decided
that any surplus funds would be placed in a special escrow account to be used
for field school purposes.

Field School Committee
From 1965 to 1968 the field school committee had consisted of three
members appointed annually. In !969 the committee was increased to
include, besides the chairman, five members (two of these to be the
archeologist and the camp director) to be appointed annually. Stipends for
the archeologist and the camp director were discussed, but no action was
taken.
A major change was made in the structure of the field school committee
in November 1979. A proposal was presented to the board of directors that a
standing field school committee be appointed and that the committee consist
of six members with staggered three-year terms. The overlapping terms of
committee members would provide a continuity and capability for long-range
planning not possible with the annually appointed committees. After a trial
period to determine the feasibility of the proposed change, a formal revision

Richmond, Richmond, and Greer--TAS Field Schools

109

of the TAS By-Laws was proposed and passed at the annual meeting in
October 1981. Article III was revised to add the following to Section 2,
Standing Committees, paragraph (5) Field School Committee:
The Field School Committee shall consist of six members who shall serve
three-year terms on a rotating basis, with two members retiring annually. The
initial committee shall be appointed by the President and draw lots to determine
two each of one-, two-, and three-year terms. Thereafter, the President shall
appoint two members annually to replace those who are retiring. The duties of
the committee shall be to carry out the directives of Article VI of these bylaws, to
solicit and investigate potential field school projects, and to oversee the
maintenance and acquisition of Society properties relating to field school
operations.

Field Camp and Equipment
Originally an associated institution, such as the University of Texas
in Austin, provided most of the field equipment needed for the TAS field
schools. Screens, shovels, buckets, line levels, trowels, and wheelbarrows
could be borrowed for the short duration of the field school. As archeological
work at various universities in Texas increased with governmental requirements for surveys around planned water-impoundment areas, direct alliance
of TAS with universities ceased. As a result, TAS members were asked to
provide personal field items--clipboards, compasses, trowels, line levels,
writing equipment, and, sometimes, buckets and screens. As members added
to their personal archeological kits, so, too, did TAS. Gradually the society
purchased field equipment, large screens, a portable laboratory, and laboratory supplies.
Purchase of a kitchen trailer, which had been recommended and
discussed previously, was approved in January 1970 by the board, and by
May a trailer was ready for use at the Guadalupe Mountains National Park
field school.
Camp facilities, although still relatively primitive by some standards,
have improved (Figure 2). At early field schools it was necessary for teams of
volunteers, usually from the local sponsoring society, to work at the camp site
during the two weeks before field school. The volunteers dug latrines,
gathered or provided field and camp equipment and supplies, erected the
large army squad tent that was borrowed from the University of Texas in
Austin and that served as a cooking-dining-lab shelter (Figure 3), cleared the
proposed camp area, and, in a few cases, constructed access roads--or at least
made existing roads passable. Today, equipment other than individual gear is
provided by the society. Portable toilets are rented and serviced by the
supplier. Electricity and water sources are available and merely have to be
connected to the kitchen trailer (Figure 4) and showers. Costs of necessary
services and supplies are provided through the registration fees paid by the
participants. Local supporting societies and volunteers from among the early
arrivals provide the labor required to set up the camp and field laboratory.
Members furnish their own camp gear--tents or trailers, ice boxes, chairs,
plates and utensils, and tables. The planning, maintenance, and success of the
camp is the direct responsibility of the field school chairman and the camp
boss.

Attendance at field schools gradually increased. In 1962 at the Gilbert
site, about 77 members participated during the 24-day dig; in 1969 at Sanford,
204 were present; and in 1970, the 245 participants at the Guadalupe
Mountains field school far exceeded the anticipated number and taxed the
facilities and limited camping area. As a result, at the July 1970 board meeting
it was decided that a ceiling should be put on the number of field school
participants and that field school planning must begin earlier than the spring
before the June field school.
At the August 1970 board meeting it was ruled that the archeologist
should be relieved of all duties not directly associated with archeology and
archeological planning and theory.
Educational Emphasis
Ed Jelks, director of the first field school at the Gilbert site stated: "It was
not a field school, nor was its purpose to train amateurs how to dig; whatever

was learned about field techniques by the participants was incidental to the
primary objective of getting the site excavated" (Jelks 1967:iii).
Although the first few field schools were conducted primarily as digs, an
educational format soon began to take shape (Figure 5). Participants
gathered in the afternoons and evenings to discuss not only what they were
doing, but also archeological theory, methods, discoveries, and contributions.
Vocationa! archeologists, always present at these gatherings, openly shared
their wide variety of archeological experiences.
With the suggestion by Isabel Lobdel at the December 1964 board
meeting that the "approach be that of a school rather than a project," the
direction in which the summer digs had been moving became formalized.
Field school participants received instruction in a variety of field techniques:
site survey; excavation of burned rock middens, terrace sites, historic and
prehistoric structures, and rockshelters; recording rock art; and laboratory
work, including washing and cataloging artifacts. Afternoon instruction,
when it occurred, often included activities such as flint knapping (Figure 6),
floral and faunal identification, and pottery making. Evening programs
became regular events and involved not only the professional archeologists
attending the field school, but also invited speakers with expertise in specific
aspects of archeology, geology, geography, ethnology, and other fields of
related interest.
Conditions and Operations
A committee appointed in 1969 for study of field school conditions and
operations reported in January 1971 to the board and recommended that the
field school be a continuing program. Specific suggestions were made for the
school, including:
I) The field school is for teaching and should be planned in terms of teaching.
2) Curriculum should include theory and technique.
3) The field school should include an awareness of other archeological
programs in the state.
4) Teaching methods should include specific topic lectures.
5) The field school committee should consider having the school in the same
location for two or three years.
6) There should be an increase in the archeological staff, possibly to include
archeological assistants.

The Guadalupe Mountains field school in 1970, which resulted in
limiting the number of participants, also brought the realization that the field
school needed careful and detailed planning as well as financial assistance for
certain staff members. The board of directors allotted $50 to the archeologist
for the preparation of a preliminary report. For the first time there was
official recognition of the time required of, and expenses incurred by, the
archeologist.
In 1971 the board granted a fee of $750 for the archeologist in charge, this
fee to compensate for field expenses and to defray costs of preparing a formal
archeological report. At the June 1974 board meeting a motion was made and
passed to pay the archeologist $1500 on the receipt of a 50- to !00-page

114

Texas Archeological Society

print-ready manuscript. However, changes were suggested in the payment
schedule at the January 1975 board meeting. Alan Skinner suggested that the
archeologist receive $500 at the completion of field school, $200 for a
summary report as soon after the field school as possible, and a remaining
balance of $700 to be paid on receipt of a final report manuscript for
publication. This suggestion was approved by the board in March 1975.
In addition to setting partial compensation to the archeologist for report
preparation, board members and the field school committee felt that a
contract outlining What the TAS expected of the archeologist was needed. At
the January 1977 board meeting, a formal contract was proposed to protect
the interests of both the archeologist and TAS.
Field Training and Site Selection
Education of participants in archeological field methods has been a
primary goal of the field school. As various individuals became adept in field
techniques, they were asked to assume the role of crew chiefs and to train less
experienced members (Figure 7). In June 1966 the recommendation was
made that the crew chiefs make specific performance evaluations of their
crews and that these evaluations be used in selecting future crew chiefs. In
actual practice, the use of formal evaluation forms has not been accepted;
personal, informal evaluations are preferred.
In the mid-1970s an appointed committee worked for over a year on a
field school manual that would outline general goals and specific procedures
for crew chiefs. It was expected that the manual would provide consistency in
the quality and performance of instructional activities. In March 1975, 30
copies of the first manual for crew chiefs were delivered for distribution and
use at field school.
In addition to training field crews, crew chiefs submit to the project
archeologist written reports (Figure 8) on daily and overall activities. This
information is used in a variety of ways, including the preparation of the
preliminary and final archeological reports.
A list of suggested readings is published in the spring issue of Texas
Archeology preceding the field school. The readings enable prospective field
school participants to become familiar with regional archeological research
relevant to the site of the forthcoming field school. Although bibliographies
of suggested readings had been published for several years, the practice was
formalized by a recommendation of the board of directors in April 1969.
The successful, basically unsupervised work of the young people at the
Oblate site (1963) laid the groundwork for the early "Beaver Patrol" and
current Youth Program. Under this program, young people under the age of
14 who have had no field experience are instructed in many aspects of field
work through limited excavation and other activities that are specifically
planned for their interests and abilities. Participants in the Youth Program
have made positive contributions to the school through surveying, excavation,
and ecological studies. Other activities vary with the interests of the groupâs
leaders and have included field trips and experiments in pottery making, rock
art, lithic manufacture, cooking, fishing, and construction of habitation

structures. Many archeologists in Texas and elsewhere can trace their early
interest in archeology to this program.
TAS field school participants represent a wide variety of occupations
and talents: farmers, ranchers, oil field workers, teachers, secretaries,
surveyors, artists, photographers, doctors, lawyers, homemakers, and students
are a few examples. Except for the very young, there are ways in which each
person may contribute to the field school. Members with physical restrictions
of mobility, sight, hearing, or age participate in activities such as screening,
washing and cataloging artifacts, record keeping, and, depending on the
memberâs experience, assisting and instructing newcomers.
It has been the practice of the board and of the field school committee to
select field school sites that offer a variety of experiences to participants, not
only in the type of field work to be done but in location within the state and
kind of site. As a result, field school participants have experienced site surveys
and excavations in the Hill Country; excavations at a historic presidio in
southeast Texas; excavation of Caddoan burial sites in deep East Texas; site
survey and excavation of prehistoric and historic sites on Galveston Island;
excavation of a Panhandle aspect site near Amarillo; area survey and
excavations of burned rock middens and rockshelters near the Pecos River;
and site survey and rock art recording in Guadalupe Mountains National
Park on the Texas-New Mexico border. In all, 19 different areas of Texas (see
Figure 1), each with its unique archeological puzzles and natural setting, have
been investigated. The profusion of potential archeological data and the
variety of field experiences offered, in addition to the hospitalitâÂ¢ of the
landowners, have enabled TAS to conduct field schools for two successive
years at each of two locations (Eubank Ranch in Brown County and Paris
Ranch in Kerr County) and for three successive years at one location (Rowe
Valley in Williamson County).
That TAS is recognized foi" its professional level of training is evidenced
by the collaboration with TAS of both state and federal agencies: the
National Park Service at Sanford Reservoir (Figure 9) and Guadalupe
Mountains National Park; the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department at
McKinney Falls State Park and Galveston Island; and the Texas Highway
Department at Musk Hog Canyon and in Kerr County.
Since the beginning of the field school, college students interested in
archeology have participated on an informal basis. Occasionally students of
the cooperating archeologist have attended for the purpose of gathering data
for a report or publication. For example, several students from Texas Tech
University attended the Sabina Mountain No. 2 field school near E1 Paso as
part of their field training. Formal academic recognition of the TAS field
school came in 1982 at Rowe Valley when Dr. John Fox, director of the
anthropology program at Baylor University, accepted student Carol Kehlâs
plan for an individual study program (Carol Kehl: personal communication).
The plan, as outlined, required attendance at the TAS field school, reading
and reporting on the suggested readings published with the field school
announcement, and a detailed oral report at the end of the summer semester.
The course carried three hours of undergraduate credit. Elton Prewitt,
archeologist, and Jane Schweitzer, coordinator for the field crews, designed a
program that allowed Kehl to experience all phases of field school.

Site selection is the prerogative of the field school committee and is based
on the availability of an archeologist with the time and interest to conduct the
school at a particular site or area, on the suitability of a location and facilities
for camping, on the location as related to previous field schools, and on the
support of local TAS members.
In 1970 TAS members were asked to evaluate the value and effectiveness
of the field school program. The results of the questionnaire were presented at
the February 1971 board meeting. Responding members considered the most
valuable aspects of field school to be the archeological training they received
and the chance to meet and associate with other people interested in
archeology. Less than 5 percent of the respondents suggested that the evening
lectures needed to be better organized. Responses to a question about the
overall effect of the field school were almost unanimous in stating that
personal improvement in archeological techniques resulted from participation
in field schools.

Information Dissemination
Archeological data, like any other scientific information, is of little use
unless it is disseminated. For this reason, TAS members have been
encouraged to publish their work (whether resulting from field school or from
other areas of study) either as articles in the TAS Bulletin or newsletter, as
papers at the annual meeting, or as articles in regional archeological society
publications, such as La Tierra (San Antonio), The Artifact (El Paso), and the
Bulletin of the South Plains Archeological Society (Floydada).
The archeologistâs report, one of the most important sources of specifc
field school data, may not be published for several years after the date of the
field work. Reasons for delays include the lack of funds for special analyses
and the lack of available time for the archeologist to work on the report. TAS
members often volunteer to analyze data and write sections for the final
report. Extenuating circumstances, such as illness, may prevent the completion
of a report. In these cases it becomes necessary to find an alternate analyst and
author.
One of the more difficult projects undertaken in conjunction with a TAS
field school was the writing assignment and report compilation for the first of
the two field schools at Eubank Ranch near Brownwood (Figure 10).
Emphasis was placed on daily records and summaries of work accomplished,
and crew chief Norma Hoffrichter was placed in charge of instruction on daily
recording and compilation of the report. The writing experiment proved a
much more time-consuming and difficult project than was first contemplated.
The final result, compiled and edited by Norma Hoffrichter and Beth Ogden
Davis (1981), was issued as a TAS special publication and is an excellent
source of data and general information on the 1979 field school. To date, this
publication and an article in Texas Archeology (G. Humphreys 1979:3) are
the only published reports of the 1979 Eubank Ranch school.
The TAS field schools are unique in that vocational and avocational
archeologists work together to attain common goals. The success and interest
generated by the TAS program has encouraged at least one other state group

Richmond, Richmond, and Greer--TAS Field Schools

119

to initiate a field school program. E. Mott Davis reported to the board at the
March 1972 meeting that the Arkansas Archeological Society planned to
institute a field school for amateur archeologists. Their interest was generated
by the national publicity which the TAS field school had received.
An avocational certification program is incorporated into the field
school programs of both Arkansas and New Mexico. In response to
membership interest in a similar program for Texas, a TAS committee was
appointed to study the Arkansas and New Mexico programs. At the board of
directors meeting in October 1973, the committee reported that TAS should
not incorporate a certification program since it was not considered necessary
or advantageous.
Media coverage of field schools has long been recognized for its value in
increasing public awareness of the value of archeological and historic
resources. However, media coverage of archeological projects can result in a
crowd of visitors who may unintentionally impede or disrupt fieldwork or
damage sites. For some field schools, such as the Sanford Reservoir project,
the traditional press conference was scheduled on the day before the end of
field school, with the agreement that the locations of sites and field camp not
be identified. In later years, however, the positive value of widespread media
coverage has been recognized, and media personnel have been welcome to
visit the sites and the camp activities during the field school. To date,
disruption of archeological work and other field school activities has been
minimal.
Together with articles in the TAS Bulletin and newsletter and formal
archeological presentations at the annual meeting, media coverage has
assisted the TAS field school program by making the people of Texas aware
of the diversity and significance of their historic and prehistoric heritage.

SUMMARY OF TAS FIELD SCHOOLS, 1962-1982
The following summaries are intended as descriptions of field school
activities, with emphasis on archeological aspects. Field school summaries
are presented in chronological order and include information on the project
archeologist, archeological sites investigated, and work accomplished. Administrative information is summarized in Table 1; report information, in
Table 2; and archeological work, in Table 3.
Most site numbers are the trinomial numbers (Smithsonian system)
assigned by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Austin (e.g.,
41TV 12, with 41 indicating Texas; the next two letters, the county designation;
and the final number, the site). Southern Methodist University numbers are
preceded with an X (e.g., X41LR8). Some national recreation areas do not
use the trinomial system and their numbers are preceded with area letter
designations (e.g., Sanford Recreation Area sites are preceded with SARE).

Texas Archeological Society
1962: Gilbert Site (41RA13)

Rains County, northeast Texas, June 22-July 15
Director: Edward B. Jelks
Site types: encampment or village area
Work done: excavation--5 middens; site survey
Temporal context: Protohistoric (Historic Indian)
Number of participants: 77
The Gilbert site (41RA 13) is located in Rains County in northeast Texas,
about 70 miles east of Dallas. The site consists of a series of low mounds
located on a hill above Lake Fork Creek. The area contains a wide ,~ariety of
animal and plant forms--edible (wild blackberries and persimmon) and
inedible (poison ivy). Soils in the area of the site consist of red and yellow
clays overlain with a fine sand topsoil. Most cultural materials and features
were in the sand layer.
Harold Akins of Sulphur Springs originally noted the site in the spring of
1962. Further investigation by R.K. Harris of Dallas verified that the area was
probably the location of an Indian encampment or village which, based on the
mixture of European and Indian artifacts, predated A.D. 1800.
Tests in two of the site middens produced materials which indicated that
the site was of the Nortefio focus (eighteenth-century Wichita Indians) dating
approximately A.D. 1700-1850 (Jelks 1967:3-4).
The field school camp was located in a loosely designated area near the
site. The number of participants per day during the 24-day survey and dig was
seldom as many as 30, although the total number over the period of the dig
was 77. Meals were prepared by participants (usually two people drew KP for
each meal or, in some cases, for the day). A large tarp held up by small trees
cut for the purpose and guyed by ropes to larger trees served as a cooking,
dining, and lab shelter. Portable stoves and scrounged, donated, and
borrowed pots, pans, and cook gear on homemade tables constituted kitchen
equipment. Considerable good-natured heckling by hungry onlookers often
accompanied preparation of the evening meal.
Work crews of 6 to 10 people during the week and as many as 30 on the
weekends recorded 17 middens in the site area. Additionally, two pits which
apparently had been used for storage were found. No evidence of permanent
structures such as post molds or floors was noted. What appeared to be bits of
wattle-and-daub were observed and might indicate locations of possible
structures (Jelks 1967:14).
Five small middens were excavated by the field school participants. The
number and variety of recovered artifacts contributed to the high morale of
the workers. An unexpected stratigraphic problem appeared in the form of a
clay mound on top of a midden layer (Davis 1962). It was thought that
individual middens represented house structure locations, but no physical
evidence of houses was found (Jelks 1967:13-14).
Artifacts recovered at the Gilbert site, although of both Indian and
European origin, are believed to represent only an Indian occupation. Certain
European materials were adapted by the Indians; for example, arrow points
were crafted from flattened gun barrels, bits of brass, and various decorated
metal gun fittings (Jelks 1967:30). Metal arrow points, referred to as Benton

Richmond, Richmond, and Greer-- TA S Field Schools

129

points, have been found in other sites designated as Nortefio focus sites and
are estimated to date from the mid-eighteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries
(Harris et al. 1967:32). Parts of guns of both English and French origin also
support the 1700-1850 estimated dates for the site.
A wide variety of ornaments are of both Indian and European origin.
Numerous European trade beads were recovered, as well as objects that
apparently were adapted as ornaments, including a coin pendant bearing the
date 1749, and two metal buttons. On the basis of bead style alone, dates for
the Gilbert site could be estimated to be 1740-1770 (Harper et al. 1967:87-104).
Of the Indian artifacts found, 2,221 pottery sherds, representing a large
number of vessels, are certainly the most numerous. The sherds, decorated
and undecorated, also represent a variety of vessel types. The ceramics and
the geographical !ocation of the site imply a Caddoan association, but
diagnostic ceramics to support this conclusion are not present (Story et al.
1967:165).
The final conclusion drawn by Jelks and his associates reflect the success
of the investigations: "knowledge of 18th Century French trade goods on the
southern plains--guns, beads, knives and the like--is enlarged considerably
by the findings at Gilbert" (Jelks 1967:244). To say the least, that was quite an
auspicious beginning for the TAS field schools.

1963: Oblate Site (41CM1)
Comal County, Central Texas, June 22-July 7
Directors: Curtis Tunnell and E. Mott Davis
Site type: rockshelter and terrace
Work done: excavation--rockshelter 41CM 1; deep test on terrace
Temporal context: Archaic-Late Prehistoric
Number of participants: 70
In June 1963 the second annual TAS summer field school was held on
property formerly owned by the Oblate Fathers in Comal County. The
property was located below the anticipated reservoir level of Canyon Dam,
and TAS work was conducted in the anticipation of probable loss of
archeological data as well as loss of any future opportunity to salvage data.
The general purpose of the TAS field school was outlined in Texas
Archeology 7(1), April 1963: (1) to carry out the excavation and analysis of a
significant archeological site (or sites) through the coordinated efforts of the
society membership; and (2) to provide society members with instruction in
scientific methods and techniques of archeological work.
All materials collected were placed under the custodianship of the
University of Texas and the Travis County Archeological Society. It was
formally stated that no specimens would revert to individual collections.
The Oblate site (41CM1) was located on the east side of and above
Spring Creek, a small, intermittent stream which flowed into the Guadalupe
River approximately 300 yards to the north. The area, located 12 miles
northwest of New Braunfels, was subsequently inundated when the Canyon
Dam reservoir was filled.

130

Texas Archeological Society

Archeologist Curtis Tunnell had participated in Canyon Reservoir
archeological work in 1959 and 1960 (see Tunnell 1962) and was considered
the logical director of the field school. Additional archeological supervision,
suggestions, and shovel-handling were offered by E. Mott Davis, Lathel
Duffield, Ed Jelks, Dan Scurlock, and Dee Ann Story (Davis 1963b:6).
The site consisted ofa rockshelter at the base of a limestone bluffabove a
small creek. The northern half of the shelter (75 x 10 feet*) contained about
three feet of deposit. The deposit beyond the shelter overhang was considerably deeper. Excavations were carried out within the shelter and in the deeper
deposits in front of the shelter. The deep test was dug to a depth of 12 feet
during the course of the field school. After the official school closed, some
members continued to work during the next two weeks, but bedrock was
never reached.
Objectives for the field school included an attempt to establish a more
complete temporal/stratigraphic sequence for Central Texas archeology
through diagnostic point types and radiocarbon dating. The occupation/use
area was considered to be Middle Archaic on the basis of Pedernales and
Bulverde points, which were found as deep as 12 feet in the deep-test pit
(Davis 1963b:6). Although no conclusive evidence for a stratigraphic
sequence was established, work done by TAS at the Oblate site confirmed the
results of the initial site investigation (Johnson et al. 1962). Artifacts
diagnostic of Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods included dart and arrow
points, beads, and a variety of tools.
The TAS youth program was initiated at the Oblate field school. The
program originated as activities to keep the youngsters occupied when
parents instructed them to "go play" in the southern portion of the shelter. It
soon became obvious that the young people were capable of much more than
play. They set up a square, excavated it, screened the material, and bagged all
artifacts. They literally worked like beavers, thus earning the name Beaver
Patrol. The names of some of the beavers have been lost to memory, but it is
known that Johnathan and Hugh Davis and Michael and Ann Richmond
were included. Future field schools incorporated more formal educational
programs for young people, and these programs have been the cornerstone of
a career in science for many of the beavers.
The number of daily participants varied from as few as 8 to as many as
30. Participants brought their own camping equipment and camped in an
open area about 200 yards west of the site. Two big squad tents were erected,
and cooking, eating and laboratory chores were conducted under their
shelter. As at the Gilbert site, members took turns with meal preparation and
cleanup. An assessed fee for meals was on a per capita basis (Davis 1963a:2).
Participants were not expected to provide their own digging equipment,
since most materials were provided by the University of Texas in Austin.
Some members, however, did prefer to bring personal items such as trowels,
clipboards, and compasses. Members of the Travis County Archeological

Society assisted in camp preparation, constructed paths to the site, and
mowed and sprayed the camp area.
Informal discussions, lectures, and films or slides were presented in the
evenings. Two films shown were from the Spadework for History series of
archeological films being made by E. Mott Davis and the University of Texas;
a third film in the series was made at the Oblate site after the close of field
school. Backfilling of the excavation area was postponed until after filming.
The need for electricity for the filming activity resulted in a bonus for the field
school, since an electrical line was run to the site and was available for use
(Davis 1963b:6).
A description of the late-evening activities is best given by E. Mott Davis
(1963b:7): "the pickinâ and singinâ began. The small fry included some of the
best ukulele players in the state of Texas .... and with the guitars on hand and
plenty of loud voices, we killed off many railroad engineers, sank the Titanic
innumerable times, and generally made the hills ring with music."

1964: Vinson Site (41LT1)
Near Tehuacana, Limestone County, north-central Texas, June 20-July 4
Director: Dee Ann Story
Site type: habitation area with mounds
Work done: excavation--Vinson site (41LT1)
Temporal context: Late Prehistoric-Historic
Number of participants: Unknown
The Vinson site (41LT1), believed to represent a historic Wichita-possibly Tawakoni--habitation site, was located in a treeless open field in
north-centra! Texas (Davis 1964a: 1). This farming area of plowed fields and
large pastures was once an extensive rolling grassland prairie cut by small
rivers and intermittent streams.
It was recognized that this site would not provide the abudance and
variety of artifacts recovered from the two previous TAS field school sites,
but unique archeological problems presented participants with invaluable
learning experiences (Davis 1964a: 1). Evidence of two house structures and
storage pits was uncovered with great difficulty in the rock-hard dry soil that
could only be worked with picks. The Vinson site was temporally related to
the Gilbert site (41RAI3) (Jelks 1967:4), although at the Gilbert site positive
evidence of habitation structures was lacking. Mounds were suspected to be
either filled pit houses or storage pits at Gilbert (Jelks 1967:14). Features at
Vinson were demonstrated to be habitation remains, one of which had a floor
four feet beneath the ground surface. Three storage pits were excavated, two
of which had !og floors (Davis 1964b: 1).
Under the direction of archeologist Dee Ann Story, the large number of
field school daily participants--often more than 40--were divided into
groups, which were instructed and directed by crew chiefs. Some of the
members had sufficient training and experience to instruct and direct others,
thus enabling the professionals to oversee and guide activities and be
available for consultation, as needed (Davis 1964b:2).

132

Texas Archeological Society

Although the number of artifacts recovered was less than at Gilbert,
morale remained high. One interesting area which was tested was a mound
that produced a mixture of Indian and European artifacts (Davis 1964b: i).
The now officially termed Beaver Patrol, under the direction of Cecil
Calhoun, excavated one of the house features--a round structure with four
center posts and a central fireplace. The positive contributions of the young
people under very difficult working conditions speaks well for their enthusiasm
and the excellent guidance offered by their directors (Davis 1964b: 1).
The field school at 41LT1 lasted for two weeks. Field camp was located
on Lake Mexia, about 10 miles from the site. The lake provided aâplace to
swim, and the trees provided much-welcomed shade.
Work usually began at six in the morning and halted at noon so workers
could avoid working in the sun as much as possible. After the participants had
a chance to cool off, work continued until late afternoon. Cataloging and
work with field notes continued after supper. Informal evening archeological
talks and discussions were held on an irregular schedule.
Evening programs were followed by the now traditional pickinâ ân
singinâ, with the vocal participants sometimes numbering in excess of 60.
1965: Gaulding Site (41JF27)
French Island, Jefferson County, upper Texas coast southeast of Beaumont,
June 12-19
Director: Dessamae Lorrain, assisted by Burney McClurkan and Dorris
Olds, archeologists
Site types: shell midden; burial
Work done: excavation--41JF27
Temporal context: Late Prehistoric
Number of participants: 50+
The three previous field scfiools had lasted for two weeks or more and
had been carried out with the cooperation of the University of Texas and local
archeological societies. In 1965 the university was unable to offer material
and personnel to assist field school operations, so archeologist-in-charge
Dessamae Lorrain revised plans for both field school and camp operations.
For the first time participants had to furnish most of their own excavation
equipment, there was no camp mess, and the field school lasted only one week
(Davis 1965a: 1).
The Gaulding site (41JF27), located on Frenchâs Island on the upper
Gulf Coast southeast of Beaumont (Figure 11), offered an opportunity for
TAS members to learn something of the intricacies of coastal archeology. The
site consisted of a large shell midden, up to four feet deep, in an area that had
previously been studied archeologically only through reconnaissance work
during the 1940s (Davis 1965b:4). The field school thus had the potential for a
positive contribution in Texas archeology and for a learning experience in
excavation and evaluation of a shell midden.
The primary aim of the Gaulding field school was to train individuals in
archeological techniques. Detailed instruction in field work and leadership
was offered both at the dig and in daily archeological lectures (Figure 12).

fine points of mapping, gridding, shell midden excavation, feature evaluation,
stratification determination, note taking, and cataloging of artifacts. The site
area was mapped and gridded, and 13 5x5-foot squares were dug, in addition
to trenches and test pits (Davis 1965b:6).
As excavation of the four-foot-deep shell midden proceeded, the layered
structure of the midden became apparent. The primary task for the workers
was to determine stratigraphy within the midden. Artifacts generally were
sparse. Some pottery, a few projectile points, and bones representing turtle
and alligator were found (Davis 1965b:4).
On the last official day of field school, the discovery of a flexed burial
provided excitement and a final flurry of hard work. The bones were too
friable to survive removal intact; however, they were completely recorded,
then removed and wrapped. The shattered skull was jacketed in plaster and
removed. No grave goods were present (Davis 1965b:6).
Field camp was located in a wooded area shaded by tall trees, and a
two-track road led through the rice fields and woods to the camp. In dry
weather the road was passable, but five inches of rain fell immediately before
field school and turned the access into a morass. The mud was deep and
virtually impassable, and with each vehicle that attempted it, the "road"
became worse. Once in, members were not inclined to leave. Fortunately, an
alternate exit route was available at the conclusion of field school (Anne Fox:
personal communication, n.d.).
Despite snakes, mosquitoes, rain, and mud, participants were enthusiastic. Apparently hard work and difficult conditions during the day only
make the evening socializing more enjoyable.
1966: Dunlap Site Complex (41CX5)
Crockett County, southwest Texas, June 18-26
Director: Burney McClurkan
Site types: burned rock middens; rockshelters
Work done: excavations--41CX5 (Dunlap site complex consisting of Red
Mill rockshelter and 2 burned rock middens), 41CX6, 41CX7 (rockshelters); testing--41CX8 (burned rock midden)
Temporal context: Middle Archaic-Late Prehistoric
Number of participants: 150
Signs directing 150 participants to the fifth annual TAS field school site
were posted along the highway between Ozona and Sheffield. The field camp,
a relatively short distance from the road, extended at least one-fourth mile
along a bench near the base of a hill, where cedar trees helped provide shade
(Davis 1966:2-3).
The Dunlap site complex is located in Crockett County at the western
edge of the Edwards Plateau and just east of the Pecos River. It is semiarid,
rugged country with its share of thorny plants, including yucca, sotol, various
cacti, and catclaw. Steep-sided hills with limestone layers harbor rockshelters.
In the valleys below the shelters are burned rock middens. Three of these
areas--two middens and a rockshelter near the field camp--constituted the
primary Dunlap site complex (41CX5). Another midden (41CX8) plus two
rockshelters (41CX6 and 41CX7) on the Owens Ranch also were investigated.

Richmond, Richmond, and Greer--TAS Field Schools

135

The Dunlap site complex (41CX5)--a burned rock midden within the
field camp area (Midden 2), a second midden across the gully (Midden 1), and
a rockshelter above the field camp (Red Mill Shelter)--apparently was
evidence of area use by hunting and gathering peoples during the Middle
Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods (Word 1966:10-12). This area, first visited
in April 1966 by a TAS reconnaissance group, was selected for the field school
because the area offered sufficient work opportunity for participants.
Permission to work on the property was given by owner Basil Dunlap, of
Ozona. Jeff Owens, of Iraan, also granted permission for work on his ranch,
where two shelters were investigated (41CX6 and 41CX7) (McClurkan
1966:5).
The primary purpose of the field school was to provide experience and
training in all phases of field archeology. Because of the large registration,
various activities were planned, including excavation of shelters and burned
rock middens, mapping of sites and instruction in use of mapping instruments
such as transit and alidade, cataloging and other laboratory activities,
recording procedures, and surveying. Crew chiefs and their crews were
assigned specific activities (McClurkan 1966:6). Working crews of 50 to 60
members were present on any single day, and crew assignments and crew size
varied with the archeological activities and individual training needs (A. Fox
1966:7).
An analysis of activities at the completion of each field day determined
any need for improvement in archeological work, training programs, or camp
operation. Archeological record keeping was the responsibility of the crew
chiefs, and they, in turn, assigned specific record-keeping chores to crew
members. In addition, a recorder was assigned to keep a daily log of progress
and to incorporate all individual reports into a permanent file (A Fox
1966:7-8).
Owens No. 1 (41CX6) and Owens No. 2 (41CX7), two rockshelters on the
Owensâ property, were tested. A test trench showed the deposit in Owens No.
1 rockshelter to be 36 inches at its deepest point. The depth of deposit in
Owens No. 2 also was about 36 inches. Deposits were trenched from the back
wall of each rockshelter to the overhang. Artifact yields from both tests were
similar in number and type of material. On the basis of recovered artifacts-including dart points, knives, scrapers, and a few manos--these shelters were
dated to the Late Archaic period (Fullen 1966:15).
Red Mill Shelter, part of 41CX5, is approximately 60 feet wide, 35 feet
deep from the front of the overhang to the back wall at its deepest point, and 7
feet high at the highest point. A large talus slope extends about 100 feet
downhill from the mouth of the shelter. The presence of three pot holes
indicated that the deposit had been disturbed. As excavation progressed, it
was noted that culture-bearing deposits were severely disturbed to a depth of
31 inches, and no stratification could be determined. Artifacts included
Fresno, Alba, and Livermore arrow points and Ensor and Langtry dart
points and indicated a cultural-temporal context of Middle Archaic to Late
Prehistoric periods (Word 1966:10-12).
Excavations at Middens 1 and 2 at the Dunlap site complex have been
described by Calhoun (1966:12-13) and D. Lorrain ( 1966:13-15). Midden No.

1, a circular burned rock midden about 30 feet in diameter, contained 12
slab-lined basins believed to have been used in processing sotol. The basins
were within a layer of organically stained marl with flecks of charcoal and
some burned rock located toward the interior of the 1.5-foot-deep midden.
Some of these basins were superimposed on other, similar basins, and
therefore represented at least three use episodes. Few artifacts were recovered
from the midden. The most numerous were scrapers of various sizes. A small
potsherd was found on the surface beside the midden, and mano and metate
fragments were found in the midden fill. An area containing flint debitage
south of the midden may have represented a habitation area (Calhoun
1966:12-13).
Midden No. 2, a circular mound of burned and cracked limestone rock,
was about 50 feet in diameter and about two feet deep at the center. No
hearths were evident in this midden, although, excavation in the center of the
midden revealed that the bedrock was overlain by a 6-inch-thick layer of
loosely cemented calichelike material. This layer contained typical midden
soil but no burned rock. The majority of the few artifacts found were located
at the edges of the midden; only a few were located near the center, close to the
surface. Artifacts recovered consist of dart points, point fragments, scrapers,
and some flint flakes (D. Lorrain 1966:13-14).
Again, as in the past, the young people made a positive contribution. A
teen-age group with Dan Fox as leader conducted a reconnaissance and
excavation of a burned rock midden (41CX8) on Live Oak Creek. The
midden, which was about 50 feet in diameter, was gridded and trenched, and

the surface of the midden and surrounding area was collected. Most artifacts,
scarce and nondiagnostic, were found on the midden (D. Fox 1966:15-16).
At the time the work was done at the Dunlap field school sites,
knowledge of the archeology in the immediate area was limited. TAS
members experienced an important lesson by observing the destruction pot
hunters can cause to a potentially valuable archeological site.
The dayâs work, reviews of West Texas archeology, pictures of various
phases of the work, and crew chief reports were included in discussion periods
each afternoon. Opportunity was provided for question-and-answer sessions.
After the meetings, most people headed for Live Oak Creek, some six miles
away (Figure 13).

1967: Harold Williams Site (41CP10)
Ferrellâs Bridge Reservoir near Pittsburg, Camp County, northeast Texas,
June 17-24
Director: Ned Woodall
Site types: middens, habitation and burial areas
Work done: excavation--Harold Williams site (41CP10)
Temporal context: Late Prehistoric Caddo (Titus focus)
Number of participants: 80-100 average per day
The Harold Williams site (41CP 10) is located on a terrace of Dry Creek,
a tributary of Big Cypress Creek in the Ferrellâs Bridge Reservoir area near
Pittsburg. The slightly undulating low hills and sandy topsoil of the area are
typical of the northeast Texas piney woods.
It was known from previous finds that the area represented a Late
Prehistoric Caddoan (Titus focus) site from which burial vessels and possibly
other materials had been removed (Figure 14). During the field school a
midden zone, several burials, and a circle of stains, possibly representing a
house outline, were found (Davis 1967b: 1).
On the basis of surface evidence, the site was divided into three areas:
Area A (Figure 15), in which a ceramic bottle with a unique engraved
rattlesnake design was found; Area B, a midden area some 200 feet west of
Area A and known to have contained at least 14 burials; and Area C, which
was located at the end of a ridge above the flood plain and appeared to be a
trash pit. Each of these areas produced a variety of features, artifacts, and
problems for field school participants.
The majority of artifacts consisted Of various jars, bowls, bottles, and
vessels of different pottery types, primarily of the Gibson and Fulton aspects
(Woodall 1967: I0). The exact temporal relationships of these pottery types
was not determined.
Four features in Area B contained burials, two of which apparently had
associated pottery grave goods. Other features contained prehistoric pottery
and historic artifacts. The single feature located in Area C appeared to be a
trash pit. The fill contained sherds, flint flakes, and bone and shell fragments
(Woodall 1967:10).
The TAS work presented several archeological problems for future
study, including the presence of Gibson aspect pottery types along with an

early Fulton aspect pottery; possible differences in periods of occupation at
Area A and Area B, as indicated by pottery types; and apparently two burial
practices, indicated by burials with and without grave goods (Woodall
1967:10).
Field camp was located in an open area adjacent to the site. Heavy
equipment (wheelbarrows, large screens) was provided by TAS and Southern
Methodist University, but members were encouraged to bring personal field
equipment. A common mess was available, as well as a camp cook, and about
70 people were served at each meal (Davis 1967b:2). In addition to socializing
at mealtimes, there were the usual evening song fests, which lasted well into
the night.

1967: Mission San Juan de Capistrano (41BX5)
(Second 1967 field school)
San Antonio, Bexar County, south-central Texas, July 22-30
Director: Mardith Schuetz, assisted by Anne Fox and Jay Wise
Site type: Spanish mission
Work done: excavation--Mission San Juan de Capistrano (41BX5)
Temporal context: Historic Spanish, A.D. 1700-1800
Number of participants: 42
The primary purpose of the second field school held in 1967 was to
provide training in historic archeology (Schuetz 1968a:7). However, the
participants also had an opportunity to contribute to the understanding of
Spanish mission life in Texas.
Missing walls of the original mission complex, a paved plaza, caliche
floors, and cobbled street were located, and Mexican artifacts, including
small pots and lava pestles, were recovered (Figure 16). A lab was set up for
field processing of artifacts. Afternoon seminars were conducted on such
topics as colonial history and buildings, mission life, and identification of
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century artifacts (Schuetz 1968a:8).
The 100Â° Texas weather caused discomfort for participants, but there
was no noticeable lack of enthusiasm. According to Mardith Schuetz
(1968a:8), "The crew worked like demons and never lost their sense of
humor."
1968: Presidio Loreto (41VT8)
Victoria County, southeast Texas, June 15-22
Archeologist: E. Mott Davis, assisted by Anne Fox and Curtis Tunnell
Site type: Spanish colonial and Indian occupation area
Work done: teaching archeological techniques; excavation--Presidio Loreto
(41VT8); testing--site area; burial removal
Temporal context: Archaic-Late Prehistoric; Historic Spanish, A.D. 16001800
Number of participants: 147
The seventh annual TAS field school was the first administered solely by
the society. Emphasis was placed on instruction in the basic principles of
archeological field techniques rather than on a summer dig. Testing the site to

140

determine its nature and extent was considered important but secondary to
the teaching aspect (Davis 1968a: 1).
The Presidio Loreto site (41VT8), in Victoria County about 50 miles
from the Gulf Coast, is primarily a Spanish colonial site. Recovered artifacts
and features, however, indicated both Spanish and Indian activities (Davis
1968b:2-3).
Of the 130 people in camp at any one time, some 70 to 80 were on the dig
each day. Crews of 8 were formed for instruction, testing, and excavation.
The schoolâs goal, emphasis on teaching archeological techniques, was
immediately instigated with an orientation and mapping survey of the site.
The task took all of the first day and provided participants with both skills in
mapping and a chance to become familiar with the site prior to excavation
(Davis 1968b:3).
Area use and occupational evidence was represented by both Indian and
European colonia! artifacts, including ceramics and lithics. Crude sandstone
circular foundations were located in three areas. Although it was theorized
that these might be the remains of four corner structures of a presidio, no
evidence of a fourth structure was found. At the location where it was
assumed such remains would be, a 10x 10 foot test square produced diagnostic
materials ofa Paleo point base and a Bulverde dart point. No evidence of any
structure was found (Davis 1968b:3). In another area, a rock pile appeared to
be the remains of fallen stone walls, but there was no apparent relationship to
the circular foundations.

The presence of Spanish colonial and Indian artifacts supported the
hypothesis that the site might be the location of the second La Bahia Presidio
(1726-1749), but no definitive evidence of the presidio or its location was
found (Davis 1968b:3).
There seemed to be a transitional area on the northern part of the site
where the mixture of artifacts changed from predominantly Spanish to a
mixture of predominantly Indian artifacts, including flint artifacts and chips,
native pottery, and animal (cattle or bison) bones, with colonial pottery and
iron nails. During testing of this northern area of the site a partially frozen
flexed burial was uncovered, jacketed, and removed (Davis 1968b:4).
The Beaver Patrol contributed to the overall understanding of the site by
extensive testing of areas around one structural complex. The young people
were able to demonstrate the size and isolation of one area of ruins (Davis
1968b:3).
Lectures and slide shows on various aspects of archeology were
scheduled each evening. Rains, which plagued the field school off and on all
week, interfered with some of the lectures but did not dampen the spirits of the
participants. Unfortunately, the rains also affected the access road, which
became a "mile-long mudbath" to the highway (Davis 1968b:2).
As in past years, the sing-alongs lasted well into the early morning hours.
With wake-up call at 5:30 or 6:00 a.m., lack of sleep became something of a
problem for some individuals. It should be noted, however, that most of the
late-night revelers were on the job early and were diligent workers.

1969: Sanford Recreation Area
Lake Meredith, Canadian River, Hutchinson County, Texas Panhandle,
June 14-21
Archeologist: Jack T. Hughes
Site type: puebloan structure and burial area
Work done: excavation--SARE 145, 146, 147, and 242
Temporal context: Panhandle aspect, A.D. 1300-1400
Number of participants: 204
The stated purpose of the 1969 TAS field school was twofold: to provide
instruction in the basic principles ofarche01ogical field techniques, and to test
a series of Panhandle aspect sites to determine time relationships for a period
of Plains Indian farming activities and their pueblo-like structures on the
Canadian River (Davis 1969a:13). The sites, on the north side of the lake,
were located on the upland overlooking a creek and arm of Lake Meredith.
Pleistocene soils in the area were generously covered with red gravels and
white dolomite (Davis 1969b:7).
Four sites (field numbered SARE 145,146, 147, and 242) were selected
for study and excavation. The numbering system used was that of the
National Park Service, and SARE refers to Sanford Recreation Area.
Assistants to Jack Hughes were given the responsibility of supervising work
at specific locations: E. Mott Davis was in charge at SARE 145, a large,
multiroom site; Dessamae Lorrain was in charge at SARE 146, a scattered
dwelling site; Bill Harrison supervised at SARE 147, an accumulation of

142

Texas Archeological Society

sandstone blocks and a large rock pile; and Cecil Calhoun supervised work at
SARE 242, a burial site (Davis 1969b:9).
Each site provided valuable information as well as training experiences
for the crews. At SARE 242, four burials were found. These were flexed, in
pits, and under concentrations of slabs, with no regular burial orientation
(Davis 1969b: 13).
SARE 145, a comparatively large area, produced numerous artifacts as
well as evidence of habitation structures with remains of walls and floors.
Evidence of a succession of buildings--two to five different structures--was
found under about 3 feet of deposit. The young people worked in a lower area
of the site and located a wall and a trough metate (Southwestern-style but
made of local material). A limited amount of trade pottery was found in the
pueblo area (Davis 1969b: 14).
SARE 146 and 147, both habitation sites, contained different types of
structures. At SARE 147 there was a large rectangular structure with the
remains of a possible circular tower or storage room against the southeast
corner. Excavations at SARE 146 revealed that it was a pithouse village area
with five probable structures; the slab-lined pits extended about 18 inches
below the ground surface. Very few artifacts were recovered here (Davis
1969b: 14).
According to Jack Hughes, three general periods of occupation are
represented: pit-houses as the oldest (SARE 146), then earth lodges (SARE
147), and, most recent, the pueblo-type structures (SARE 145). The need for
additional archeological information, beyond that recovered from previous
work in the area, placed a greater significance on the TAS field school data
(Davis 1969b: 14-15).
Not only did the field school participants become more aware of the
prehistory of the Panhandle, but, thanks to excellent coverage by press, TV,
and radio, residents in the Panhandle became aware of the purpose and work
of the TAS field school. Media coverage was arranged by the National Park
Service as part of their public relations program (Davis t969b: 13).
Camp was located near Lake Meredith and above a mostly dry creek,
about two miles from the area of the sites. Field school daily attendance of
between 150 and 200 people complicated the logistics of running the camp.
The camp director and field school committee, in preparation for the influx of
participants, purchased a 10-burner stove, and two refrigerators, a water
trailer for a portable water supply, and chemical latrines were rented (Davis
1969a: 14, 1969b:7). Experience was proving an excellent teacher.
Again rain proved to be something of a problem. For the first couple of
days, heavy rains and the accompanying cooler weather caused some
discomfort but did not seem to dampen enthusiasm. Evening and night rains
continued into the week during field school, with an especially heavy storm on
Tuesday night. Access roads were all but impassable to anything but fourwheel-drive vehicles.
Work continued at the site during the day despite the rains, but the
weather definitely slowed the work. Crew chiefs were asked to volunteer to
stay on after the field school for a few days to finish some of the work. And
then the sun came out with a vengeance!

1970: Guadalupe Mountains National Park
Culberson and Hudspeth counties, far West Texas, June 13-20
Archeologists: Harry Sharer and Dessamae Lorrain
Site types: lithic scatters, burned rock middens, rockshelters with and
without rock art, Historic-European habitation areas
Work done: area survey--150 sites visited, 139 new sites recorded;
excavation--historic camp and habitation areas, small burned rock
midden; rock art recorded
Temporal context: Archaic-Historic
Number of participants: 245+
The 1970 TAS field school goal of an archeologicat and environmental
survey of Guadalupe Mountains National Park presented an opportunity for
discovery of both prehistoric and historic sites.
Guadalupe Mountains National Park, in far West Texas along the
Texas-New Mexico state line in Culberson and Hudspeth counties, is about
100 miles northeast of E1 Paso and about 60 miles southwest of Carlsbad,
New Mexico. The Guadalupe Mountains rise abruptly above the plains and
fiats to the east and south. Elevations vary from about 3,500 feet to 8,751 feet
at the top of E1 Capitan, the highest point in Texas. The eastern side of the
mountains is cut by deep canyons including McKittrick, Bear, Upper Pine
Springs, Smith, Pine Springs, and Guadalupe. To the south and west are salt
fiats and arid plains, with slopes cut by deep arroyos--topography common
to the Chihuahuan Desert. Vegetation on the lower slopes is the typical
thorny plants and greasewood of West Texas. Pinyon and scrub oak are
found on the upper slopes, where moisture is more abundant.
Archeological work had been done in the area prior to the field school,
but only 11 sites were on record at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. During the TAS survey, 139 new sites were
recorded and 11 previously recorded sites were visited. Some 10 square miles
were surveyed during the 10 days of TAS work in the area (Sharer 1970a: 1011). Park personnel had requested more intensive coverage in the southern
and western areas of the park; however, Bear, Guadalupe, and Pine Springs
canyons on the east side also were investigated (Shafer 1970a:11).
The stated purpose of the school was to provide training in archeological
survey techniques and, at the same time, to conduct a systematic site survey of
a portion of the park (Davis 1970a:2; Shafer 1970a:10). Although some
survey work had been done by TAS members in other areas in the past, this
was the first field school to emphasize intensive training in survey techniques.
Because environmental conditions, including floral and faunal populations,
topography, and geology, are directly related to area utilization, instruction
in these topics was included.
Field school participants were divided into two major survey groups with
crew chiefs in charge of small crews in each group. Archeologists Harry
Shafer and Dessamae Lorrain each were responsible for one group. One of
the two major groups went into the field each day, and the group that
remained in camp completed lab work from the previous day in the field.
Nightly lectures covered a wide variety of topics (including area geology, rock
art, and Apache ethnohistory) and were well attended.

144

Texas A rcheological Society

Sites in surveyed areas vary in size and shape. The most common
sites--large, open campsites--occur along arroyos, at canyon mouths, and
around springs. Open campsites were found principally in the south and west
flats. Ring midden sites were recorded only at elevations above 4,000 feet,
possibly because this elevation represents the lower elevation limit of the
kinds of plants cooked (sotol, yucca). In contrast to the ring midden sites,
other dome-shaped burned rock midden sites were found only in Pine Springs
Canyon (Shafer 1970a:12). Although ring middens are known to occur at
lower elevations throughout this part of the Southwest and surrounding
areas, in the survey area, specifically, ring middens were found within a rather
restricted topographic range.
Rockshelters, common in the park area, vary in size from shallow,
10-foot-long shelters to large shelters as much as 250 feet long and 100 feet
deep. Some 20 rockshelters were visited (Shafer 1970a: 12). Most shelters on
the east side of the massif are solution caves or cavities near the base of a
limestone formation that forms a cap over thinly bedded strata (Clark
1974:102). Six rock art sites were visited and recorded, four of which
(41CU 15, 41 CU24, 41 CU48, and 41CU70) are within the park area. Rock art
was recorded also at two additional shelters (41CU13 and 41CU14) in the
Delaware Mountains just outside the park. In addition to recording rock art,
TAS members collected any associated artifacts for use in establishing
chronological relationships (Clark 1974:99).
Permanent records of the rock art were made by photography, tracing,
scale drawing, watercolor, and, in the case of petroglyphs, by rubbings.
Shelters 41CU15 and 41CU24 contained pictographs (dots, hands, lines,
curvilinear and circular motifs) all done in red; site 41CU48 contained only
yellow lines, crosses, and a circle form with rays. Site 41CU70 contained
linear petroglyphs as wel! as polychrome pictographs in red, black, and
yellow (Clark 1974:102-105). Rockshelters 41CU13 and 41CU14 contained
petroglyphs in projectile point motifs as well as pictographs. With the
exception of 41CU15, stylistically attributed to the Desert Abstract Style
described by Schaafsma, all rock art motifs examined and recorded
conformed to the Jornada Style, eastern phase (Clark 1974:114-116).
Over 3,000 potsherds were found at a variety of sites, and 70 percent of
these were of the Jornada-Mogollon pottery group (Phelps 1974:121). Based
on ceramic evidence, the surveyed area was occupied from A.D. 850 to 1350
by the Jornada-Mogollon people or, according to Phelps (1974:146), by an
unidentified group dependent on the Jornada-Mogollon for pottery or
technology. The presence of ceramic sherds of the Middle Pecos Valley
indicates interaction with these groups as well. According to Shafer
(1970a: 16) there was a notable lack of pottery dating after A.D. 1400. This
may suggest that, unlike earlier groups, mobile groups known to have
occupied this area of the mountains in the 1700s and 1800s did not use pottery
made in nearby pueblos.
The location of the majority of the 59 pottery-bearing sites on the lower
slopes and fiats in the area indicates a possible agrarian population. People
may have been drawn to the area by the vast and exploitable salt deposits, and
these may have been a determining factor in areal settlement patterns (Phelps
1974:147).

The TAS members participating in site survey in the salt flats of the
southwest part of the park can attest that it is not an optimum habitation area
during the summer months. Lack of water in addition to the dessicating
effects of the salt-sand surfaces indicate a probable seasonal use by earlier
occupants of the area.
Three historic sites were investigated and reported by Kathleen Gilmore
(1970:14-15). These included a bivouac site probably occupied during the
Civil War and again in the 1870s. A house area, north of the bivouac area and
seemingly unrelated, apparently dated from the early twentieth century. The
third site, the Frijole site, is by Manzaneta Springs and is a building formerly
used as a post office for the town of Frijole during the 1930s and 1940s. A
skirmish between an army party and Apaches camped in the area reportedly
occurred in 1869, but no supportive artifactual evidence could be found
(Gilmore 1970:14).
The young people under the supervision of Paul Lorrain tested an eroded
burned rock midden (41CU3 l) in the Pine Springs area. The site was tested in
three areas and collected in a 100-square-foot area north of the midden. The
group obtained a significant sample of 515 stone fragments, five Dad-like
points, and one Meserve point (P. Lorrain 1970a).
The field school camp area was located in Pine Springs Canyon at the
base of the mountains. It was a primitive area--no facilities--but with TAS
membersâ ingenuity and the permission of park rangers, a pipeline was run
across a mountain foothill from a spring to the camp, a distance of about a
mile. With this somewhat unreliable water source (the pipeline was constantly
springing leaks), cold showers were available. Three portable latrines were
brought in, completing the "facilities." Since drinking water was scarce,
members were advised to bring at least five gallons of water with them. The
Texas National Guard in E1 Paso provided a 500-gallon water tank, which the
Highway Department filled with water. One innovation in 1970 was the
addition of a cook trailer, which had been built specifically for TAS. Francis
Stickney, camp director, and the Midland Archeological Society managed to
have the camp facilities ready for the arrival of about 221 people by Sunday
evening (the first weekend). About 25 latecomers drifted in during the
following week. As Jerrylee Blaine (1970:19) said, "This was not a simple field
school to manage. Contacts had to be made in many places, from the owner of
the local Texaco station all the way to the Pentagon."
E. Mott Davis (1970b:9) best summarized the effects of the Guadalupe
field school: "As time goes by we should be seeing significant new information
being compiled in many parts of the state because of site survey work done by
people trained at this field school."

Texas A rcheological Society

Temporal context: Paleo-Indian--Late Prehistoric
Number of participants: 1971, 300; 1972, 250+
The tenth and eleventh annual TAS field schools were held in Kerr
County about seven miles southwest of Kerrville in the Edwards Plateau
region of Central Texas. The field school camp and part of the study area were
on property belonging to Andy Paris, a member of the Hill Country
Archeological Society. Archeological work for the 1971 and 1972 field
schools was conducted in the Turtle Creek watershed and on many of the
same sites; therefore, a combined summary for both years is given here.
Much of western Central Texas is hilly, cut by creek drainages between
the hills and broad valleys. The primary survey area covered about 40 percent
of the Turtle Creek watershed. Vegetation on the slopes consists of cedar
(junipers), various kinds of oak, elm, and black persimmon trees, and bunch
and other grasses. In addition, along the creek bottoms sycamore, poplar,
wild pecan, hackberry, and willows may be found, as well as abundant smaller
bushes and plants. The hills are composed of caliche and limestone rock,
while valleys have a sandy, clayey loam topsoil overlying limestone bedrock.
The training and archeological goals included a survey and site study in
three 10-square-mile areas (or, about 30 square miles) in order to locate and
evaluate prehistoric settlement of the area (Skinner 1971a:5, 1974:5). The
Kerr County field schools provided an opportunity for those who had
participated in the Guadalupe Mountains area survey to practice and
improve their skills in a different environmental setting. During the survey,
165 prehistoric sites were located and recorded. Dates for the sites were
estimated from the Paleo-Indian to Late Prehistoric (Neo-American) periods,
based on observed diagnostic materials. Late Paleo-Indian occupation of the area was indicated by Plainview and Angostura point types. In
addition to period determinations, site activities were inferred from distributions and concentrations of flint flakes, discarded tools, and features, such
as hearths and burned rock middens (Skinner 1974:24:3 I).
During the area survey, artifact illustrations were drawn in the field
notes, but artifacts were not collected. However, six sites were carefully
collected for comparative analysis. The following site-use data is compiled
from detailed descriptions of TAS work in Skinner (1974):
X41KR191: an apparent chipping station with at least two different
occupation periods evidenced by the presence of different point technologies;
X41KR184: possible hunting camp as evidenced by tack of ground stone
tools, abundance of lithic debris, and the presence of a burned rock mound;
X41KR70: burned rock mound and surrounding living area--Archaic
period, based on surface artifacts;
X41KR201: lithic scatter terrace site represents occupation during two
separate time periods;
X41KR128 short-term, single occupation site of the Archaic period
represented by Castroville and Marcos-like points;
X41KR94: terrace site with two burned rock mounds and surrounding
lithic scatter areas that may represent a multiple occupation, based on the
presence of dart and arrow points.
Throughout the survey areas, there was a predominance of lithic
workshop sites, while only 63 burned rock mounds were recorded. Sites

representing Archaic occupations made up about 80 percent of the recorded
sites. Archaic-Late Prehistoric components were evident at 12 sites, and
uncontaminated Late Prehistoric components were present at 3 sites. Based
on this data, the occupation of the Turtle Creek watershed is considered
basically Archaic (Skinner 1974:56-65).
Excavation was conducted at three different types of sites. At the Paris
site (X41KR 1), a burned rock midden, excavation was directed at testing the
hypothesis that living areas were adjacent to, rather than on, middens, and to
isolate a "pure" Archaic living area floor. The living floors that were located
represented both Archaic and Late Prehistoric use areas which were
horizontally separated. Alton Briggs, then survey archeologist for the Office
of the State Archeologist, directed this excavation (Skinner 1971a:3-4;
1972:6).
A second site, Bushwhack Shelter (X41KR116), is a large rockshelter on
Bushwhack Creek (Figure 17). A 5 x 5-foot test square was excavated in the
54-inch-deep deposit in the center of the shelter. A well-stratified occupational
sequence for the shelter was determined on the basis of the test. The shelter
apparently was occupied before 1000 B.C. and was abandoned before the
Historic period--an inference based, at least in part, on the typology
sequence (Skinner 1974:15).
The Real site (X41KRI66), a burned rock midden in the western part of
the field school area, was selected for excavation for comparison with the
Paris midden site. The tools recovered were attributed to a Late Prehistoric
time period. An Archaic living surface underlay the midden. Prior to the Real
site excavation, midden deposits in the area were generally attributed to
Archaic occupations (Skinner 1972b:6).
Two additional studies were conducted by TAS members. The first was a
specialized environmental study of area resources. The second involved TAS
assistance in a Texas Highway Department archeological survey along a
proposed realignment of FM 480 on Verde Creek. Three sites were recorded
within the highway right-of-way, and the information was provided to the
Highway Department survey personnel (Skinner 197 lc:4).
Young peopleâs activities included the excavation of X41KR42, a badly
pothunted site for which the depth and type of site, as well as an estimate of
the types of activities conducted during occupation, were needed. In addition
to the site study, Beaver Patrol supervisors Teddy Lou Stickney and Marge
Fullen conducted various activities in plant and fossil studies. The young
people helped to prepare an interesting exhibit of various plants in the area.
The field school camp was in a tree-shaded area, level and dry, which had
been mowed and sprayed for insects and other pests. In spite of precautions,
ticks and chiggers were abundant--especially the tiny seed ticks--so much so
that the meeting area was dubbed the Tick Bowl. Other unwelcome native
residents included coral snakes. The emphasis at field school is respect for the
environment and its residents, so any snakes were caught and released away
from camp, unharmed (Figure 18). Ticks, however, were killed mercilessly.
Turtle Creek runs parallel to the campsite area and provided TAS
personnel with a swimming hole and recreation area. Late-night revellers
gathered on the limestone ledges above the creek for the traditional nightly
singinâ and guitar pickinâ.

Visitors during the course of the field school included professionals and
students from Southern Methodist University, Texas A&M University, West
Texas State University, Texas State Historical Survey Committee (now

Participants included TAS members from Colorado, Arkansas, and Louisiana, as well as all areas of Texas.
1973: Asa Warner Site (41ML46)
McClennan County, north-central Texas, June 9-17
Archeologist: Alton Briggs; assistant, Robert MaUouf
Site type: alluvial terrace campsite
Work done: excavation--Asa Warner site (41ML46)
Temporal context: Middle Archaic-Late Prehistoric (Caddo)
Number of participants: 200+
The Asa Warner site (41ML46), located about seven miles southeast of
Waco in McClennan County, is situated on an alluvial terrace adjacent to
Branch Creek, which drains into the Brazos River. A general soil profile for
the site area would show an upper plow zone in reddish, sandy clay overlying a
horizon of red clay, which, in turn, overlies a deposit of alluvial sands.
Between the clay and lower alluvial sands is a midden layer (Alton Briggs:
personal communication, n.d.). The site is on the flood plain and could be
destroyed by frequent flooding or construction of flood-control diversions.
Work at the field school included mapping, excavation, and extensive
lab work. Several deep tests were made in the sandy, clayey soil. Since most of
the site area was in a plowed field, there was no shade. As digging progressed,
the heat of the day and the lack of moving air in the bottoms of the pits were
the cause of many caustic comments.
The site appears to consist of two components--a Middle to Late
Archaic open campsite and a very small village, possibly intermittently
occupied, which is either Caddoan or Caddoan influenced. The Caddoaninfluenced occupation, although small, was of sufficient duration for the
formation of a midden. Since the recovered Caddoan ceramics were not made
in the area, the site may have served as a trading outpost (Alton Briggs:
personal communication, n.d.).
The temporal designation of Middle to Late Archaic is based on the
recovery of 38 dart points, including Gary, Fairland, Edgewood, Godley, and
Darl types. During the field school, four burials were located in the Archaic
deposits (Figure 19), and three additional burials were located after the close
of field school. The amount of skeletal material could indicate a possible
cemetery area. Further analysis of the burials and skeletal material may
provide data on the morphological and pathological characteristics of an
Archaic population in Texas, as well as information on Archaic period burial
practices (Alton Briggs: personal communication, n.d.).
The temporal context of the Caddoan-influenced occupation is deduced
primarily from the recovered vessel forms and pottery types, which indicate
an early to late Gibson aspect occupation. Alto and possibly Sanders foci

150

appear to be represented within the Gibson aspect, along with an early Titus
focus of the Fulton aspect. An analysis of the pottery from the Asa Warner
site was conducted by Bob Turner. Further examination of these materials
may provide comparative information for local ceramics and introduced
types from the northeast (Alton Briggs: personal communication, n.d.).
A preliminary lithic analysis by C.K. Chandler indicates that, in addition
to the Archaic-type dart points, 121 arrow points were recovered, approximately 50 percent of which are Perdiz. Scallorn, Alba, and Clifton types
are also represented. Examination of excavation and lithic analysis data
should provide additional correlations to the projectile point chronology
from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period (Alton Briggs: personal
communication, n.d.).
The field school camp area was several miles from the site, where large
trees provided shade for the dining and meeting area. Pests seem to follow the
field school. At Gaulding and Victoria it was mosquitoes, at Kerrville, ticks,
and at Asa Warner, flies. Although it cannot be proved, it is generally believed
flies were the distributors of a "bug" that affected the digestive systems of a
number of field school participants. The situation was serious enough that
some members departed early.
Through it all, the participants retained a sense of humor. After one
particularly frustrating day in the pits, Charlie Bandyâs crew presented him
with a pedestaled, sculpted effigy in their pit. Some avowed the likeness to an
unnamed crew chief was remarkable.

1974: McKinney Falls State Park (41TV289)
Austin, Travis County, Central Texas, June 8-16
Archeologists: Michael McEachern, Ronald W. Ralph
Site type: Historic house site, mill, and cisterns; prehistoric campsite
Work done: excavation--McKinney homestead, mill, and cistern (41 TV289);
survey and mapping--homestead area; survey--12 sites recorded
Temporal context: Archaic; Historic, mid-1800s
Number of particcipants: 230+
The thirteenth annual field school, at McKinney Falls State Park in
Travis County, was conducted with the cooperation of the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department. The area, located on Onion Creek immediately south of
Austin, included the old mill, cisterns, and homesite (Figure 20) of Thomas
McKinney, who lived there in the early 1850s. Since McKinney Falls State
Park was in the process of construction, it was desirable to survey, excavate,
and map historic and prehistoric sites in the park area as soon as possible.
TAS had the personnel and expertise to conduct part of the archeological
investigation.
The goals of the field school as stated by the archeologists were to
illustrate a variety of archeological techniques as well as to appraise the
archeological resources of the McKinney homestead complex. A booklet,
TAS Field School 1974 (McEachern and Ralph 1974), outlined the history,
proposed research plan, field school activities and responsibilities, supplemental activities (including the evening programs and guest speakers),
excavation plan with a detailed explanation of terms and methods, and

152

Texas Archeological Society

examples of various site forms with instructions for completion. This booklet
was made available to field school participants and provided answers to many
of the inevitable questions that arise during any archeological activity. For
the novice, the explanation of terms was especially helpful.
Stone ruins of the two-story McKinney homestead stand on the north
side of Onion Creek immediately east of a low-water crossing of the creek,
where a hundred years of use by wagons and automobiles has left an indelible
record on the limestone creek bed. The lower of the two falls for which the
park is named is 50 to 100 yards downstream from the crossing.
Four experiments in historical archeology were outlined ifi the instructional guide (McEachern and Ralph 1974) and reported by McEachern
and Ralph (1980a:5-127, 1981:5-55) in their two-part review of the Mc Kinney
site work. These experiments included prospecting (examining several
methods of detecting archeological features without resorting to excavation);
conventional excavation in and near the house, using as a guide a simple
predictive model; exploring the value of recent faunal collections from a
cistern excavation; and a long-term study of the rate of environmenta!
processes (McEachern and Ralph 1974:3-4, 1980a:6).
The mill, located on the north edge of Onion Creek about 200 yards east
and south of the McKinney house, was built in 1852. A low dam was built
upstream to divert water to the mill. Drilled holes and cuts in the limestone
bedrock, as well as embedded iron rods, mark the location of the dam and
millrace (McEachern and Ralph 1981:5-7). TAS excavations at the mill site
were done in one-meter squares within a metric grid pattern, and 69 squares
were excavated co varying depths in and around the structura! remains.
Excavated materials were screened and all artifacts and faunal remains were
saved. Metal, glass, and ceramic artifacts were mixed with a variety of soil and
rock deposits within the remaining walls of the mill structure. The ceramics
and some bottle-glass sherds and bases appear to date to the mid-1800s when
the mill was in use (McEachern and Ralph 1981:6, 14-15). Metal artifacts
include cartridges, nails, spikes, bolts, and a variety of broken tools. Nails,
metal construction objects, and some tools seem to date to the time the mill
was in use. Other metal artifacts date from the mid-1800s, the World War I
era, and later. A number of objects have not been dated (McEachern and
Ralph 1981:17-41).
Two cisterns were located to the south and west of the McKinney house,
and one of these was excavated. Analysis of the high artifact yield indicated
the bulk of materials were discarded prior to the mid-1930s, although a few
artifacts dated to post 1940 (McEachern and Ralph 1981:44-45). Before
the cistern was backfilled, a "time capsule" and murals were left for any future
excavators as evidence of the work done by TAS field school members.
The artifact sample recovered from the McKinney site was particularly
important, since it constituted the sample available for analysis. Although
additional work was done after the field school, budgetary restrictions limited
artifact recovery (McEachern and Ralph 1981:6).
Surveying to locate archeological features utilized both the proton
magnetometer (metal detector) and chemical pH and phosphate tests
(McEachern and Ralph 1980a:21-35); Burleigh 1980:162-163). The results of
these tests are not as important to this discussion as is the fact that TAS field

school participants had the opportunity to observe a variety of methods for
determining occupation and occupation density areas. For detailed information see McEachern and Ralph (1980a:21-35) and Burleigh (1980:
162-163).
Jim Calvert and crew conducted an archeological site survey in the
northern one-third of the McKinney Falls State Park. Twelve prehistoric and
historic archeological sites were recorded--41TV302 to 41TV313. Examples
of prehistoric lithic tools and historic artifacts occurred at four sites.
Temporal context for area use inferred from artifactual remains ranges from
Archaic to post A.D. 1900 (Calvert 1981a:56-60).
A get-together of field school participants, local landowners, and others
interested in the work being done is usually held toward the end of the field
school. At McKinney Falls, the evening included exhibits, tours, and
informative talks. Charles Johns (Figure 21), the guest of honor, had lived on
or near the McKinney place most of his life. Johnsâ family had worked for
James Smith, the owner of the property after McKinney, and as a young man
Johns had lived in the McKinney stone house. Johns said he was about 88
years old (born 1885 or 1886), and he had a remarkably clear memory. He was
able to provide invaluable historical information about the house, location
and kinds of outbuildings, and history of the area. A summation of an
interview with Johns is included in the report of McEchern and Ralph
(19801:18-20).
Camp was in a field east of and adjacent to the house ruins. For the most
part, all areas investigated were within walking distance of the camp. The
lower falls pool proved a welcome swimming hole (Figure 22). "Young"
people especially enjoyed sliding down the falls. The late evening sing-along
was held on the limestone slab above the falls, and songs occasionally seemed
to echo from the rocks.
As a direct result of the 1974 field school, Wayne Roberson, an
archeologist then with the Parks and Wildlife Department, requested names
of TAS volunteers around the state that he could call on for help with various
types of archeological projects (A. Fox 1974:3).

1975: Floydada Country Club Site
White River Canyon, Floyd County, Texas Panhandle, June 14-21
Archeologist: S. Alan Skinner
Site type: alluvial terrace occupation area
Work done: excavation--X41FL 1, X41 FL2, X41FL3; surface collection and
shovel tests
Temporal context: Late Archaic-Historic European (estimated A.D. 1000-

1850)
Number of participants: 210+
The fourteenth annual TAS field school was held at the Floydada
Country Club, about seven miles south of Floydada in White River Canyon.
The area is in the central Texas Panhandle where the White River has cut
through the caprock to form a broad, meandering canyon (A. Fox 1975:1-2).

Jim Word had been studying the site area for about 20 years, testing the
site and making a systematic collection of artifacts. A report of his work in the
South Plains Bulletin (Word 1963) was among the readings recommended to
field school participants.
Two major archeological goals were set for the field school: to develop a
well-controlled chronology for this area based on extensive testing for and
excavation of in situ deposits with appropriate artifact collection, and to
determine any correlations between surface artifact concentrations and
subsurface materials through careful excavation of large areas (Skinner
1975a:2-3).
The country club area was divided into three sites: X41FL 1, X41FL2,
and X41FL3. Each of the sites exhibited different predominant flint sources
as well as separate and distinct pottery and artifact distributions.
Site X41FL1 was the most extensive of the three sites. About 1 percent of
the site was tested. The 61 one-by-one-meter squares indicated no vertical
stratification of the site. Several hearths and bone concentrations were
located. The limited amounts and types of artifacts and cultural features led
to the inference that the site represents an intermittently occupied camp.
Occupation appeared to cover a period from A.D. 1000 to 1800, based on
pottery and other prehistoric and historic artifacts. Approximately 70 percent
of the flint at this site appears to have originated in Central Texas (Skinner
1975b:6-7).
At site X41FL2, a large part of the site area had been removed for fill on
the golf course. About 3 percent of the remaining site was excavated.
Accumulations of bison bone and Southwestern pottery types were revealed.
Pottery types included E1 Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black on White,
Ochoa Indented, Pueblo III Corrugated, and Jornada Brown. Known
temporal association of the pottery types indicate an estimated occupation
for the period A.D. 1300-1400. At site X41FL2, 90 percent of the flint was of
Alibates or Tecovas (Quitaque) Panhandle varieties (Skinner 1975b:7).
At site X41FL3, few features were located during excavation of 24
squares. Pottery designation, expected to be East Texas types, is pending
analysis. Flint-origin percentages were not as well defined as those calculated
for X41FL 1 and X41FL2; Central Texas and Alibates-Tecovas varieties each
represented 40 percent, and local flints represented 20 percent (Skinner
1975b:7).
The country club remained active during field school--sometimes to the
dismay of both golfers and field school participants. In one case a golfer "lost"
his ball in one of the excavations; in another instance a crew member received
an unexpected blow from a hard-hit golf ball, but damage was done only to
dignity (Blaine 1975:4). Surface surveyors on the high bluffs adjoining the
golf course on the north and west felt like targets as golf balls landed around
them.
The young people were involved in the study of Indian culture and crafts.
Under the direction of Claude Brown, they learned to weave baskets, make
pottery, build traps for game, and identify natural foods.
The work of the TAS field school resulted in the recovery of much
valuable information. Equally important, this investigation indicated that the

156

Texas Archeological Society

Floydada Country Club site "is a good example of the type of site which is
worthy of study over a long period of time" (Skinner 1975b:7).
As usual, evening lecture sessions were well attended with speakers
emphasizing occupation of, and archeology in, the Panhandle South Plains
region. Alan Skinner summarized field school accomplishments in a lecture
and guided tour of the area.
The camp was in a treeless area in the northwest part of the country club
property. Shade was at a premium (Figure 23). The kitchen trailer again saw
duty, and three meals a day were prepared and served to those not wishing to
prepare their own. It should be noted that the majority of field school
participants took advantage of the meal option.
TAS field schools always seem to be plagued with pesky critters. At
Floydada it was mosquitoes and chiggers. The situation was serious, and
arrangements were made for aerial spraying of the area (Figure 24). For some,
this event may have been the highlight of the field school, and enthusiastic
observers cheered the pilot as he maneuvered through the canyon and over
the site.
Late evening sing-along festivities were held on a rise several hundred
yards above camp. Despite the heat of the day, jackets were welcome in the
late evening. Some of the more enthusiastic participants decided a song book
would be helpful, since not all singers knew the words to the older songs, so
the TAS songbook became available. Flashlights cast eerie glows on faces as
singers peered at the dimly lit words.
1976: Musk Hog Canyon
Crockett County, Southwest Texas, June 12-19
Archeologists: Harry Shafer and Gary Moore
Site types: burned rock midderis, rockshelters, lithic scatters, rock art, and
hearths
Work done: excavation--burned rock midden sites 41CX218, 41CX238,
41CX241, and rockshelter 41CX133; survey--435 sites recorded
Temporal context: Paleo-Indian-Late Prehistoric
Number of participants: not recorded (registration limited to 250)
Musk Hog Canyon is a moderate-sized tributary canyon system of the
Pecos River. The area is eroded limestone plateau country with bare rock
landscape on the slopes and tops of the mesas and moderate to deep alluvial
soils in the canyon floors (Sharer and Moore 1976a:2). In the rugged, rocky
terrain and semidesert environment it seemed that all the plants had thorns or
spines and all the animals either bit or stung.
As stated in an informal report of Sharer and Moore (1976b: 1), "the field
school project was conducted in conjunction with plans to construct
Interstate Highway 10 through part of the canyon and to provide data on an
area which was likely to become a National Register District." Earlier surveys
in the area had shown that Musk Hog Canyon contained a large number of
archeological sites.
Two major goals for the field school were the excavation of several
known sites and the survey of the Musk Hog Canyon system. Field school

participants were divided into two large groups: one under Harry Shafer for
excavations, and the other under Gary Moore for the field survey. Within the
large groups, smaller groups were assigned to crew chiefs and crew chief
supervisors for specific excavations or survey areas. A primary teaching goal
was to have each field school participant observe and participate in an
on-going research project (Shafer and Moore 1976b:1).
The number of field school participants enabled the archeologists to
attempt a 100 percent survey of the Musk Hog Canyon drainage system. Of
the 512 documented archeological sites in the area, 435 were documented by
TAS members during the field school (Shafer and Moore 1976b:3). Site types
include burned rock middens, hearths, lithic and burned rock scatters, and 40
rockshelters, some with associated rock art. Previous work in the Lower
Pecos area by the Iraan Archeological Society and other investigators shows
the area was utilized by hunting and gathering groups from the Paleo-Indian
period through the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, with the Archaic
sequence spanning some 7000 to 8000 years (Shafer and Moore 1976a:2-3).
Test excavations were conducted at five sites: four burned rock middens
(one each at 41CX218 and 41CX238, and two at 41CX241) (Figure 25), and
one rockshelter (41CX 133). The primary purposes of these excavations were
to define and evaluate use areas, to recover charcoal for radiocarbon dating,
to recover plant material for botanical analysis, and to recover an artifact
sample (Shafer and Moore 1976b:4-6).
The young people were divided into two groups: the 6-to-12-year-olds,
who made a number of field trips as well as participating in nature study and
flint knapping; and the 12-to-17-year-olds, who were termed the Young
Archeologists group. The older group undertook two projects: the excavation
of 41CX103 (a burned rock midden), and the experimental baking--and
consumption--of lechuguilla, yucca, and sotol in rock ovens (hearths). After
24 hours, the sotol and yucca were not done, but the lechuguilla was
thoroughly cooked (Shafer and Moore 1976b:6-7).
An independent study on flotation procedures using soil samples taken
from the excavations was conducted by John Keller and Bruce Fullem (1977)
during the field school. Goals for the flotation experiments--primarily the
collection of a floral sample and an evaluation of flotation methods--were
separate from those of the field school. The primary interest of the researchers
was methodology, and a floral analysis was not included in their report.
Field camp was located at the Jeff Owens ranch house (Figure 26). The
house and yard were off limits for TAS members, but shade from the large
trees in the yard was welcome, especially in the late afternoon. Nearby Live
Oak Creek served for both bathing and recreation, but no detergents were
allowed in the water. At the rancherâs request, certain rules were observed: no
firearms, no motorcycles or motorbikes, no pets in camp or in the field, a
20-mile-per-hour speed limit on ranch roads, use of established roads only,
and avoidance of livestock.
Crews usually left camp before 7:00 a.m. and returned at about noon.
Afternoon activities in camp, which included demonstrations of flint
knapping by archeologists, proved popular with both young and old. The
area was populated by a wide variety of birds because of the abundant water
supply at the stock tanks and in the creek. Bird watching was especially good

late in the afternoon. An activity that drew a large audience was Milton Bellâs
demonstration of the construction and use of the atlatl and spear.
Emphasis of the evening programs was on the geology, history,
ethnology, and archeology of West Texas and Northern Mexico. As usual,
speakers were experts in the various fields of study and often included slides
with their presentations. The white side of the cook trailer doubled
satisfactorily as a projection screen.
Several of the field vehicles contained CB radios, and a base station was
set up in camp to monitor the locations of various survey crews and to relay
messages. The survey area was fairly extensive, and the use of CB
communication provided a degree of safety in case of trouble.
It is the exceptional field school that does not have an accident or a near
miss. With over 200 people camping and working in primitive conditions, it is
to be expected. Usually mishaps are minor and require only minimal first aid
and a band-aid. The 1976 field school mishap, unfortunately, was far from
minor. A survey crew ran into a pocket of gas near a buried pipeline, and two
members of the crew were rushed to the Iraan hospital. Fortunately neither
suffered lasting ill effects, and they returned to camp later that evening.
Rattlesnakes were plentiful in the area, but few were seen during the
survey. One exception was the small rock rattler with which crew chief Jimmy
Smith shared a resting place while recording a site.

1977: Sabina Mountain No. 2
Tigua Indian Land, E1 Paso County, far West Texas, June 11-18
Archeologist:
William Mayer-Oakes assisted by Alton Thoms, John
Montgomery, Phil Bandy
Site types: village, Sabina Mountain No. 2; lithic scatters
Work done: instruction at Sabifla Mountain No. 2 in excavation and on-site
survey, laboratory and photographic techniques; off-site survey--37 sites
recorded
Temporal context: E1 Paso phase, Jornada branch, Mogollon culture, A.D.
1300-1400
Number of particcipants: 233
Sabina Mountain No. 2 is a pueblo site located about 22 miles east of E1
Paso near the edge of the Hueco Bolson. It is a desert area (northern
Chihuahuan Desert) with sparse vegetation and sandy soil. The site, an E1
Paso phase agricultural settlement of the Jornada branch of the Mogollon
culture, was probably occupied during A.D. 1300 to 1400 (Mayer-Oakes et al.
1977:1). Such pueblos were built in rows of single-story adobe buildings to
which additional rooms could be added. As indicated by stone tools and
pottery artifacts recovered during the field school investigation, the prehistoric
inhabitants apparently were sedentary agriculturalists who traded with other
communities in Texas, New Mexico, and Northern Mexico (Mayer-Oakes et
al. 1977:1).
The Tigua Indians, on whose lands the field school excavations were
conducted, were congenial and cooperative hosts, and they were interested
visitors to the site.

Richmond, Richmond, and Greer-- TA S Field Schools

Emphasis for the sixteenth annual field school was on education in
archeological technique. Innovative procedures to facilitate the basic goal
included pre-field-school workshops, which were held in E1 Paso in May.
Because of distance and time limitations, the pre-field-school work primarily
involved those TAS members living in or near E1 Paso (Fitzgerald 1977:4).
The Sabina Mountain No. 2 field school possibly was, in terms of
teaching goals, the most carefully planned and organized school yet offered to
TAS members. The school was divided into three broad areas of field
activities: on-site excavations (Figure 27), on-site surveys; and off-site survey.
Related activities, such as laboratory and photographic work, were also
undertaken (Mayer-Oaks 1979:13-16). A great deal of time and effort was
expended by Bill Mayer-Oakes, his staff, and students from Texas Tech
University. The staff archeologists were research persons, leaders, and
teachers for the crew chiefs, who did the actual crew instruction. Four
archeologists, assisted by seven Texas Tech University students, constituted
the staff (Mayer-Oakes 1979:4-5). The goal was to ensure that each field
school participant experienced a representative range of archeological
activities, including excavation, on- and off-site surveys, environmental
studies, and laboratory work (Figure 28).
Excavations were conducted in limited portions of the Salsina Mountain
No. 2 site. With the emphasis on teaching, excavation efforts and data
recovery were limited to two rooms that had been excavated previously.
Approximately 100 one-meter-square units were excavated by 122 people
(Mayer-Oakes 1979:5). Several features noted on the surface were not
sampled in excavation (Bandy 1977:2). An area that had been previously
disturbed by relic hunters was enlarged in an attempt to determine site
stratigraphy.
Various aids and techniques for surface survey, recording, and collecting
were demonstrated and taught. On-site survey by 2-meter-wide travel
corridors and later by transects was conducted. Collecting corridors provided
walkways to undisturbed areas. Some of the survey areas were 100 percent
collected; in other cases features were recorded but no collections were made.
Ceramics and chert were the major classes of collected materials, with E1 Paso
Brown and E1 Paso Polychrome the predominant ceramics (Mayer-Oakes
1979:16). For many features, including large lithic and ceramic scatters and a
burned rock feature, the density of surface materials precluded exhaustive
mapping (Montgomery 1977b:3).
Transect surveys were conducted in areas representing a variety of
environmental zones. Roughly 600 acres were covered in the six-day off-site
survey. Emphasis was placed on site identification and recording procedures.
Participants were able to complete several site survey forms at the 37 sites
located, many of which seem to be hunting-gathering campsites. Ceramics of
the Mesilla or E1 Paso phase provided temporal data, as did the variety of
lithic tools (Thoms 1977b:3-4).
In addition to the field work, a carefully planned lecture program series
and trips to the Tigua Indian reservation and to the Hueco Tanks pictograph
site were entertaining as well as informative.

Field camp was an old Girl Scout camp where there was no shade, plenty
of sand, and a limited water supply. Auxilliary water tanks were supplied
(including one by the Third Cavalry, Fort Bliss) and kept filled by the E1 Paso
County Water Improvement District (Fitzgerald 1977:5). Coping with high
daytime temperatures of over 100 degrees and dessicating winds proved a
challenge to TAS members not used to the West Texas summer. Wind blew
continually, and tents and gear were distributed across the desert in the wake
of the stronger gusts. Other problems were presented by the sand, as vehicles
became stuck and were moved with difficulty. Landmarks were few and
two-track roads numerous, so off-site surveyors at times had difficulty
relocating camp. Although long-sleeved shirts, wide-brimmed hats, and
boots were recommended, some daring excavators and surveyors braved the
desert bareheaded, barebacked, and sandaled.

1978: Galveston Island

Site types: prehistoric camp and cemetery sites, early historic occupation
area, historic house site
Work done:

historic house site (41GV70) and Galveston Island State Park; survey-10 sites recorded
Temporal context: Late Prehistoric, Historic European
Number of participants: 326
The history of Galveston Island and the lure of the seashore (especially
after E1 Paso) proved an enticement for some 326 TAS field school
participants from Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Unfortunately,
there was little shade and a lot of mosquitoes. A large part of the camp area
was located so that it benefitted from a welcome breeze at night, even though
the days were hot and sunny. Participants enjoyed the surf after a hot day of
digging, mapping, or surveying.
Education in archeological techniques and methods was emphasized in a
variety of activities, including location and investigation of prehistoric camp
sites and cemeteries, site surveys of areas of the island and adjacent mainland
by both on-shore and off-shore (flotilla) surveyors, and investigation of the
earliest historic occupation on the west end of Galveston Island. Participants
were introduced to specific field techniques through orientation sessions prior
to field crew assignment (Bruce 1978a:20). Both afternoon and evening
programs were offered; afternoon attendance averaged about 50 and evening
attendance about 230.
Testing at the Warren D.C. Hall site (41GV70), a mansion and its
surrounding grounds, produced both European ceramics, dating to the 1840s,
and Indian materials. One projectile point appears to have been made of
glass, indicating historic Indian occupation (Bruce 1978a:20).
In cooperation with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, an
investigation of the western portion of the Hall site extending into the
Galveston Island State Park was carried out by field school personnel to

determine if the proposed construction of a park maintenance road would
disturb important features in the site. Test work included an intensive survey
of all the site lying within the park boundaries and test excavations in an area
of the site suspected to contain a prehistoric cemetery. The investigation was
authorized by Texas Antiquities Permit No. 176.
Surveys by boat and on foot (Figure 29) located 10 previously
unrecorded prehistoric sites. All were located on the same high ground as the
TAS camp (Bruce 1978a:20).
The Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) is !ocated toward the west end of
Galveston Island, approximately 11 miles west of the city of Galveston.
Prehistoric living areas on the crest of the ridge were excavated. Fauna!
remains, pottery, projectile points, and possible gaming pieces were among

the recovered materials cataloged (Figure 30). Two burials, located the last
full day of digging, were of an adult woman and a four- or five-year-old child.
An arrow point found adjacent to the third lumbar vertebra of the adult was
the apparent cause of death. There was no evidence of the cause of death for
the child. The burial was removed by the staff and a few helpers who
continued to work after the close of the formal field school (Bruce
1978a:20-21).

Texas Archeological Society

The 1979 and 1980 TAS field schools were held at the Eubank Ranch at
the invitation of Bransford Eubank, long-time TAS member and field school
participant. Bransford and Martha Eubank, with Bransfordâs sisters Mabel
and Lydia, hosted TAS members and guests during the field schools (for the
sake of brevity, the two field schools are discussed together in this summary).
The ranch, located about 20 miles north of Brownwood near Cross Cut,
apparently was a favorite camp and living area for both prehistoric nomadic
groups and historic settlers, as evidenced by the lithic scatters and burned
rock middens of prehistoric groups and by log houses, outbuildings, and a
stone bridge among the historic remains.
Eubank Ranch is located along both banks of Pecan Bayou, a permanent
water source in northwestern Central Texas. It is a lightly wooded, brushy
area with soils varying from a reddish sandy loam overlying a red clay, to
yellowish caliche and limestone deposits. Grasses are abundant, and in
historic times livestock have been a primary source of income. Even more
recently, the general area has been targeted for oil exploration and
production.
Field school participants were offered a variety of experiences ranging
from walking surveys and boat surveys along Pecan Bayou to midden
excavations, mapping and excavating old house sites and ruins, archival
searches, compilation of an oral history of the area, and lab work. The 1979
field school concentrated efforts on testing the various known prehistoric
sites (primarily burned rock middens), a possible historic Indian site, and the
various historic sites, including Byrdâs store (Figure 31) and the Dick Stone
log house (G. Humphreys 1979:3; Hoffrichter and Davis 1981). Particular
attention was concentrated on the site surveys along Turkey Creek, Red River
(Brown County), and Pecan Bayou, in addition to the midden excavations.
Some 61 sites were located, of which 5 were historic (Figure 32). One
rockshelter (41BR165) was located during the Moore Ranch survey. The
remainder of the reported sites were prehistoric and included burned rock
middens, lithic scatters, quarries (procurement areas), hearths, and buried
camp sites. Aboriginal site dates estimated from observed and recovered
diagnostic materials ranged from Middle Archaic (Nolan and Pedernales
projectile points), to Late Prehistoric (Scallorn, Perdiz, and Washita point
types).
Middens were classified either as mound middens (those without an
obvious depression or hearth) or ring middens (those with an evident or
apparent central depression). Middens were examined primarily to determine
structure, use, and age. In addition it was hoped that any similarities or
differences between midden sites attributable to physical location could be
determined. Generally, middens contained little artifactual information, but
the surrounding living areas were more productive.
At the 1979 field school a serious attempt was made to involve
participants in writing a major portion of the final report. Norma Hoffrichter
chaired the committee that worked with contributors to aid and encourage
the production of a detailed account of the 1979 field work. The final informal
field school report, edited by Norma with Beth Davis as assistant editor
(1981) appeared as a special TAS field school committee publication, The

Texas Archeological Society

TAS Field School, Cross Cut, Texas, 1979. This report provided a source of
archeological information on the accomplished work, pending the publication
of the archeologistâs formal report.
The writing project was intended to educate participants in the
importance of recording daily activities and observations at all archeological
sites. In the past, field school members were indoctrinated in all phases of field
work, but the keeping of daily and detailed field notes received less emphasis
than excavation, survey, and laboratory techniques. Although crew chiefs
had handled the important field note phase of the work in their daily written
reports to the archeologist, it was felt that all participants could âdevelop
writing skills and an understanding of the importance of publishing results of
archeological work. Recorders were assigned in each crew and daily reports
were turned in to Norma for typing. As could be expected, some efforts were
excellent, some writers needed more than a little encouragement and
guidance, and some gave up in frustration. Admittedly, writing a report of
what has been done is time consuming and not as interesting as field work, but
without the writing, finding artifacts becomes pothunting and site destruction.
Probably one of the most important aspects of the report writing and
detailed record keeping is that reports provide vital physiographic and
environmental information to the archeologist. The archeologist working
with over 200 field school participants may not have time to make detailed
areal observations. Accurate accounts of topography, flora and fauna, soil
variations, and site locations in relation to geographical variations can be
compiled for the archeologistâs report, thus allowing the archeologist to
concentrate efforts on analysis and evaluation (Gerald Humphreys: personal
communication, n.d.).
Midden testing was completed in 1979. During the 1980 field school,
areas surrounding the middens were investigated. Testing at the Fisk Branch
ring midden (41BRI09) indicated the midden had a depth of 60 to 70
centimeters and contained charcoal, flint flakes, clam shells, and charred
seed. A test square north of the midden in what appeared to be an activity area
produced 53 potsherds, flint flakes, and cobbles. Tests to the south of the
midden located the distal tip of a large biface and a spokeshave (Bugnitz
1981:40-41). Further investigation in 1980 indicated an artifact-rich activity
area surrounded the midden. The substantial lithic inventory, including
projectile points, scrapers, drills, and bifaces, was recovered from a large
hearth containing mussel shells and deer bones (G. Humphreys t980b:2).
Two unique areas of small burned limestone rubble were tested at site
41BR 110, the Gilliam Branch mound midden area. Surface finds in the area
included miscellaneous worked flint, a flint knife, and medial blade fragments.
No projectile points or pottery was reported. Bob Burleson (1981) describes
site 41BR 110 as a camping-living-activity area with slab hearths, cores, chips,
and debris, indicating a core reduction or chipping station. Finds in the
midden include two grinding stones, a mussel shell, flint flakes, a projectile
point midsection, and a possible bead. Areas to the south and east of the
midden were tested. To the south two shallow, basinlike hearths and a
probable third hearth were found. Broken metates and cobbles lined the
basins. A test in the area to the east indicated a work area, with about 95

Richmond, Richmond, and Greer-- TAS Field Schools

169

percent of the debris as core reduction flakes; a hammerstone was found in
association with the flakes.
The discovery in 1979 of at least three buried hearths and various lithic
tools at the Salt Well site (41BR 107), a buried site with eroding burned rock,
indicated further archeological potential. Investigations of the area in 1980
show this apparent camp site may be older than the midden sites (G.
Humphreys 1980b:2).
During the 1980 survey, an additional 49 sites were recorded, the
majority of which were along Pecan Bayou, on the Moore Ranch and near the
TAS camp. The prehistoric sites included a number of lithic scatters, possible
campsite locations. One historic site could be the remains of an old house
structure.
An interesting phase of investigation was the interviewing of older area
residents for a history of the area. An archival search and the extremely
interesting accounts of long-time residents provided an understanding of
what life was like in the late 1800s and early 1900s in what is now Brown
County. About 26 people were interviewed in 1979. Information on the Dick
Stone house (41BR 102) included photographs of the area and the family, as
well as data on the succession of occupants and specific information on the
building construction. Numerous stories and legends about Byrdâs store,
Indians, schools, outlaws, saloons, and cattle rustlers not only provided data
on area life-styles, but were also entertaining. One of the most helpful
accounts was that of Mrs. Allie Byrd Hounshell, who was interviewed in 1980.
She was born in 1889 and spent her early years in a log house about a mile
from the Eubank property (G. Humphreys 1980b:3; S. Humphreys 1981:11).
Bransford Eubank also was a valuable source of historic data. Bransford
was born on the ranch, and, except for the years he spent in the ministry and
as a foreign missionary, has always lived there. As a result of his and his
familyâs many years and associations in Brown County, Bransford was able to
recount much of the area history and to suggest area residents who might
supply additional information. Bransford also accompanied a group of area
surveyors and pointed out numerous site locations, thereby saving time as
well as providing valuable information.

Texas Archeological Society

Choke Canyon on the Frio River, now the site of a reservoir, is located in
Live Oak and McMullen counties in South Texas. The area has been the
subject of archeological research by several institutions (including the
University of Texas at Austin, Texas Historical Commission, Texas Tech
University, and Texas A&M University) and since 1977 has been under
intensive investigation by the University of Texas at San Antonio. Approximately 400 sites have been recorded, the majority of which are prehistoric,
representing the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. The few historic sites
date between 1850 and 1880 (Hall 1981a:1).
Grant Hall, associated with the Choke Canyon archeological work,
suggested that TAS conduct the 1981 field school in the area. Among the
specific sites proposed for the study were several prehistoric open campsites
and two historic sites--a dugout homesite (41MC67), the only one known in
the area, and a rock-lined well shaft (41LK202) (Hall 198 l a:2).
The 1981 field school will be added to the list of field schools that are
remembered for the rain and mosquitoes. At Choke Canyon mud was deep in
the camp area, and some tenters awoke to find their personal items afloat.
And it rained! A number of camps were moved in hopes of finding
surroundings that were, if not dry, at least less wet and muddy. Mosquito
spray was at a premium.
Despite the conditions, the participants remained cheerful, and work
continued after clean-up operations. The laboratory was set up in an old
gymnasium building. Field crews surveyed and excavated assigned areas,
albeit in the mud. Rain did curtail the amount of work done, but
accomplishments were significant by the time field school ended.
Sites were selected for study on the basis of informational need and
educational value. Eight sites were selected for excavation, five of which
contained prehistoric remains. In addition to the excavations, archival and
site survey crews conducted additional investigations.
Crews surveyed 1600 acres of an upland area of the H.D. House ranch on
what is now the south side of Choke Canyon Lake. Five sites were recorded,
four of which were prehistoric and consisted primarily of burned rock scatters
with associated cores, thick bifaces, tools (including a Clear Fork gouge), and
debitage. The one historic site located contained wall foundation remains,
some scattered whiteware pottery, and glass sherds. The survey has provided
important comparative data about the character and distribution of area sites
(Hall 198 lb:5).
Archival research was conducted primarily at the courthouses in George
West and Tilden. Two historical house sites (41LK53 and 41MC67) were the
focus of a search for ownership and occupation data. The dugout site
(41 MC67), one of the more interesting historical sites, dates to the early to
middle 1800s and may be the earliest historic structure known in the area.
Artifacts recovered include three smoking pipe fragments, ceramics, a musket
ball, buttons, and a dangle from a Spanish-style bridle bit (Hall 198 lb:5).
TAS crews were unable to complete work on historic site 41LK202, a
house structure with an apparently related rock-lined well shaft, which was
exposed in the eroding river bank. Work conditions were difficult and
somewhat hazardous as crews recorded the superstructure of the well. Rain

Richmond, Richmond, and Greer--TAS Field Schools

and a rising Frio River forced the crews to abandon work before the
excavation was completed (Hall 1981b:4).
Temporal context for the five excavated prehistoric sites varied. At
41LK51 the upper level deposits yielded Late Prehistoric remains, including
arrow points, pottery, and bone. An important find was a piece of obsidian,
which originated far from Choke Canyon. Most cultural material was in the
upper 30 centimeters and indicated a probable occupation between A.D. 1000
and 1500. A Late Archaic horizon evidenced by materials including Ensor
and Fairland dart points was located in the deeper deposits (Hall 198 Ib:3).
Site 41LK74, a relatively shallow site, revealed Kinney, Tortugas, and
Ensor dart points, as well as a great deal of fire-cracked rock. This site is
attributed to the Middle to Late Archaic (Hall 198 lb:4).
At 41 MC55, the activities of one group of people over a short period of
time during the Late Prehistoric seem to be evidenced by the shallow deposit
and an activity area around a hearth. The Late Prehistoric assignment is
based on Perdiz and McGloin arrow points as well as various other artifacts,
including ceramics and debitage. The McGloin point, commonly found in the
Corpus Christi Bay area, may indicate access to coastal resource areas. Dates
for site 41MC55 are estimated at A.D. 1300-1600 (Hall 1981b:3-4).
The most remote site (some 13 miles from camp) was 41 MC296, a Late
Archaic through Late Prehistoric site as evidenced by diagnostic materials,
including Ensor and Tortugas dart points and Perdiz and Scallorn arrow
points. One Mission point and a hand-forged knife blade suggest the presence
of a historic Indian camp (Hall 198 l b:4).
In addition to the traditional evening programs and speakers, afternoon
short courses were offered on a variety of topics, including use of a Brunton
compass in site mapping, historical artifact analysis, use of a plane table and
alidade, making aboriginal-type ceramics, human skeletal material recovery
and analysis, and flint knapping (Hall 1981b:5-6). These short courses,
although not as well attended as the evening programs, were judged both
interesting and helpful by attendees.
1982: Rowe Valley (41WM437)
Williamson County, Central Texas, June 5-12
Archeologist: Elton Prewitt
Site type: Prehistoric campsite
Work done: Excavation--41 WM437; survey: 18 new sites recorded; archival
research
Temporal context: Late Prehistoric (Toyah phase)
Number of participants: 212+
The Rowe Valley site, located on the San Gabriel River about 14 miles
east of Georgetown and approximately 32 miles north of Austin, is a deep
terrace site on the south side of the river. The valley is owned by the Rowe
brothers, Jack and Lee (now deceased), who hosted the more than 200 TAS
members who camped on their property.
The camp, in a grove of pecan, cedar, and elm trees, was immediately
adjacent to the site. The level, grassy area had been mowed, cleaned, and

172

Texas Archeological Society

sprayed prior to the campersâ arrival. The proximity of the camp to the site
(about 50 yards) allowed participants to walk to work in a matter of minutes.
Laboratory facilities were located at the site, and laboratory questions or
problems usually could be answered promptly by crew chiefs. Probably one
of the more valuable aspects of the proximity of site, laboratory facilities, and
camp was that all field school participants could observe the daily progress of
the investigations. Work areas are often remote and members may never see
the various sites and work areas, with the result that only a limited number of
participants may observe and learn the various research techniques used.
For the first time since Guadalupe, the cook trailer was not used. Meals
were catered for those not choosing to prepare their own.
Preliminary work at the site by Elton Prewitt and the Travis County
Archeological Society indicated a Toyah phase component (Perdiz points)
apparently discretely separated from earlier materials. The original plan was
to expose this occupation area horizontally and reconstruct the camp layout.
In addition to the excavation, an area site survey along two stretches of the
San Gabriel River and historic-sites archival research were planned (Prewitt
1982a:2).
About two weeks before field school, a sterile alluvial deposit over the
central portion of the site area was removed by heavy equipment, including a
Gradall and three dump trucks donated for TAS use and manned by
volunteers. Removal of the overburden allowed the TAS members to begin
work at the top of the first cultural zone. The Gradall operator was able to
detect the slightest change in the surface, as well as any rock, flint, or bone,
and in only one day removed the overburden to within an inch of the deposit.
The depth of sterile deposit was less than anticipated, and in parts of the
site bone and burned rock were revealed. The site adjoins an area that has
been used as a gravel borrow pit. Occupational debris (including flakes, tools,
charcoal, and bone) could be seen in three distinct levels in the pit wall. Since
vertical distribution of cultural materials was evident, field school investigations focused on the horizontal patterning of use areas across the site. Only
the upper cultural zone was excavated during the 1982 field school, and even
that excavation was not completed in the eight working days available.
A variety of features, including stone-lined hearths, rock hearths (Figure
33), stone-tool production areas, and bison and deer processing stations have
been located. Butchering stations are on the northern area of the site toward
the San Gabriel River; hearths are generally to the south. A "plaza" area with
no discernible features is in the center of the exposed area (Prewitt 1982b:4).
Two features require further investigation. An unusual hearth, which
may have post molds adjacent to it (possibly representing remains of a
cooking rack), is located at the west side of the site. A concentration of deer
antlers was found in the same area. This find was made late in the week, and,
since such concentrations have been found in association with burials, their
removal was postponed until the 1983 field school (Prewitt 1982b:4; Elton
Prewitt: personal communication, n.d.).
The dominant diagnostic lithic tools found are Perdiz and Clifton arrow
points, basal- and corner-notched arrow points, four-edge beveled knives,
and end scrapers. A number of ceramic sherds, apparently representing at

least four vessels (two of which may be reconstructed), were found. Sherds of
one of the vessels have been tentatively identified as Patton Engraved, a
Caddoan-type pottery that has a temporal range from Protohistoric to early
Historic. Other sherds were described as burnished brownware and redware
pottery types typical of Central Texas. Additional artifacts include tubular
bone beads, a large, flat bone pendant (Figure 34), and possible bone tools
(Prewitt 1982b:4; Elton Prewitt: personal communication, n.d.).
Although the major emphasis was on excavation, site survey and
archival research teams made positive contributions to archeological understanding of the area. The survey teams recorded 18 new sites and revisited one
prehistoric site. Site dates based on diagnostic materials ranged from Early
Archaic to Historic, and all newly reported sites had been disturbed to some
degree by farming activities. Sites were limited to the San Gabriel terraces and
flood plain. The uplands were almost totally lacking in prehistoric materials
(Ralph 1982:8).
Access to Rowe Valley from State Highway 29 was across an old iron
bridge (Figure 35) over the San Gabriel River on County Road 369. The
bridge, rusty and paved with worn wooden planks, was one of the historic
sites researched and recorded by the archival crew. It was learned that the
bridge was originally built in 1909, a new part was added in 1914, and the
bridge was rebuilt after a flood in 1921 (Victor 1982:7). Members and visitors
experienced the thrill of driving over the historic one-way bridge (trailers and
heavy trucks were advised of an alternate route). Shortly after field school the
old bridge was retired in favor of a modern structure. The iron bridge has been
retained as a historic landmark.
An outstanding feature of the 1982 field school was the young peopleâs
program conducted by Bob and Mickey Burleson. Under their direction
brush shelters (Figure 36) and cooking hearths and racks were constructed,
fish were caught, tools made, cooking done, and games played. The Rowes
were impressed with the "village" and asked that it be left for visitors to see.
Media coverage was excellent. Newspaper reporters from Taylor,
Georgetown, and Austin presented both pictorial and narrative accounts of
the site work. Television coverage was given by Temple-Waco and Austin
stations. As a result of media exposure, visitors flocked to the site, where they
were presented a brief introduction to archeology at Rowe Valley.
The usual evening programs included discussions of areal occupation
and history, and other topics related to archeology. On visitors night the local
hosts, dignitaries, and friends were invited to share the evening meal and
participate in an "awards" night. Traditionally, the Titanic was sunk; this year
over 200 people participated in the event, led, as usual by the indomitable E.
Mott Davis and his guitar (Figure 37), with support from the TAS musical
crew.
As usual, work continued to the last day. If a heavy rainstorm had not
occurred on Friday, the work probably would have continued past the end of
field school. The open pits were given time to dry out, and a week after field
school the Travis County Archeological Society helped Elton Prewitt cover
all excavated areas with heavy plastic weighted with sand.

The field school at Rowe Valley in 1983 continues work begun in 1982.
Elton Prewitt continues to serve as archeologist at the site, which holds the
potential for information not previously reported, as well as presenting TAS
members the opportunity to learn and experience a wide variety of
excavations and laboratory techniques.
SUMMARY
The annual field school has progressed steadily over the years since 1962
and the summer dig at the Gilbert site. Early field schools, of necessity,
depended heavily on vocational archeologists for basic and theoretical
instruction, as well as for the more mundane jobs of organization and
direction. A cadre of experienced TAS members grew from the roster of
participants at the first field schools and were able to assume the responsibilities of basic instruction in field archeology. With relief from the responsibilities
of individual instruction, and with the creation of a field school committee to
handle planning and camp arrangements, the archeologists were able to
concentrate on archeological activities.
Competence of field-school-trained members has resulted in suggestions
from state and national agencies (Texas Highway Department, Texas Parks
and Wildlife, National Park Service) that TAS participate in planned
archeological projects. For example, at Musk Hog Canyon, McKinney Falls
State Park, and Guadalupe Mountains National Park, TAS cooperated with
governmental agencies in area site surveys and excavations.

Selection of a location for the annual field school is based on
archeological data need, suitability of the area for both teaching and
educational requirements, and the availability of a professional archeologist
able to donate time and energy to a research design, archeological field work
supervision, and writing or supervising the writing of a formal report of the
work. Preference is given site locations that are in danger of destruction by
construction or natural causes.
Accomplishments of the societyâs summer field school and its contributions to Texas archeology are numerous and widely recognized throughout
the state. The first official archeological excavation of a shell midden on the
Texas coast was that of the TAS field school at the Gaulding site in 1965. As a
result of TAS work in 19 locations around the state, many sites of significant
cultural importance have been investigated and reported by avocational and
vocational archeologists in TAS and local society publications. Formal
reports have included at least one doctoral dissertation (Skinner 1974) and
two masterâs theses (Boisvert 1980; Moore 1982).
The sponsorship by TAS members of young people 17 years old and
younger who have an interest in archeology but would be unable to attend
field school without an adult has encouraged youthful participation and, for
some, the pursuit of archeological careers.
Dissemination of archeological information on various field schools
through media coverage of the activities has helped to make the general public
more aware of local archeological resources and the need for recording
information scientifically.
Field school participation has grown from a handful (often only 6 to 10
people at the site during the week) to 200 to 300 daily participants.
Percentages of the TAS membership attending a field school have varied
from I percent at Oblate to more than 30 percent at Galveston. With this growth
have come improvements in educational procedures and activities, field
school structure, camp management, and equipment. Texas Archeological
Society field schools provide a chance for people of all ages, from all walks of
life and numerous professions, to work in and contribute to the field of
archeology.
