MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), was selected by the City of Del Rio, via
its engineering and environmental permitting contractor, CP&Y, Inc. (CP&Y), to conduct a cultural
resources inventory survey and assessment for the proposed San Felipe Country Club Expansion
Project. The San Felipe Country Club is an existing 9-hole golf course located off the northern
side of US Highway (US) 90 between North Bedell Avenue and San Felipe Springs Road in
eastern Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas. The proposed expansion would involve development
of a currently undeveloped 32.4-hectare (80.0-acre) tract located north of and adjacent to the
existing country club property. For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the project area is
considered to consist of the 32.4-hectare (80.0-acre) expansion tract.
The proposed project is being sponsored by the City of Del Rio, a political subdivision of
the state of Texas. Consequently, the proposed project falls under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal
permits, funding, or licenses have been identified for the project; however, it is possible that
federal permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act (CWA) may be required. In this case, any portion of the overall project area
covered under the federal permit would also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. As the project represents a
publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact potentially significant cultural
resources, the project sponsor was required to perform a cultural resources inventory and
assessment of the project area.
From March 6 to 8, 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana Smith and archeological
technician Jesse Dalton, under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator,
performed an intensive survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that may be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the project area on foot
and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources.
The project area is currently in use as an archery range. The main archery range is
located near the center of the project area. Two-track roads and walking paths circle around the
range, radiating out from them and leading to areas where targets are located. The majority of
the project area is covered in dense vegetation, consisting mainly of mesquite, sagebrush, yucca,

prickly pear cactus, and dense short to tall clump grasses, interspersed with more open areas.
San Felipe Creek flows southward along the eastern margin of the project area, and an unnamed,
intermittent tributary of San Felipe Creek flows southeastward across the project area,
discharging into San Felipe Creek in the southern portion of the project area. The area
surrounding the confluence of the two creeks is poorly drained, and a large pool of standing water
covers much of the surrounding area. A second unnamed, intermittent tributary of San Felipe
Creek flows southeastward through the northeastern portion of the project area, discharging into
San Felipe Creek about 190.0 meters (623.2 feet) south of the northeastern corner of the project
area. The southern portion of the project area nearest to the existing golf course was found to be
extensively disturbed, apparently in association with various ongoing construction activities on the
golf course. Disturbances observed in this area include large, overgrown piles of limestone
cobbles and boulders; brush piles; patches of artificial fill in some areas; and a long, open trench
that was probably excavated for a subsurface utility line. Bulldozers were actively working on
various brush-clearing and earth-moving activities in this portion of the project area during the
survey. The remainder of the project area appears to be largely intact, though construction, use,
and ongoing maintenance of the archery range and brush-clearing to remove mesquite and other
underbrush likely have caused some surficial and shallow subsurface disturbances. Scattered
modern trash piles were observed within the central and southern portions of the project area.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 0.4 hectares (2.0 acres) within
project areas measuring between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11.0 and 100.0 acres) in size. As such,
40 shovel tests would be required within the 32.4-hectare (80.0-acre) project area. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 49 shovel tests. The pedestrian survey with
shovel testing typically revealed silty loam and silty clay loam sediments overlying clay or
limestone bedrock or bedrock gravels. The underlying clay subsoil was encountered at relatively
shallow depths of 30.0 to 55.0 centimeters (11.8 to 21.7 inches) below surface in many shovel
tests, primarily in the western portion of the project area, which is characterized by upland
settings. Limestone bedrock and gravels were observed on the modern ground surface at
scattered locations in this portion of the project area. The overlying silty loam and silty clay loam
sediments extended to depths of 50.0 to 100.0 centimeters (19.7 to 39.4 inches) or more below
surface in shovel tests excavated in the eastern portion of the project area on the floodplain and
terraces of San Felipe Creek.
Portions of three previously recorded archeological sites are located within the project
area—41VV431, 41VV432, and 41VV444—that were reinvestigated during the survey. These
sites were originally recorded by Elton Prewitt in 1973 and 1974 during the San Felipe Watershed
Project survey and during a follow-up undertaking. As originally recorded, all three sites consisted
of scatters of aboriginal midden deposits, including burned rocks, chipped stone artifacts, and
scattered hearth features, dating from the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods. Site
41VV444 additionally contained a historic-era structure, the San Felipe Springs Pumphouse, a
municipal water supply structure constructed in the early 20th century. The pumphouse is located
on the western side of the golf course to the south of the project area and would not be disturbed
as a result of the proposed undertaking. Sites 41VV431 and 41VV432 were designated as
contributing elements of the San Felipe Creek Archeological District along with 11 other sites

recorded along San Felipe Creek to the north of the current project area. The San Felipe Creek
Archeological District is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) in 1974. Site 41VV444 was not designated as a contributing element of the San Felipe
Creek Archeological District, though it has also been determined to be eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP based on numerous eligibility reviews conducted between 1998 and 2000 despite prior
disturbances from construction of the golf course.
Based on Horizon’s investigations, portions of previously recorded sites 41VV431 and
41VV432 contain archeological deposits that have the potential to enhance our understanding of
the prehistoric past; as such, these portions of the sites are eligible for designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under Criterion 4 of 13 TAC 26 (Part 2, Subchapter C, Rule §26.10)
(under the Antiquities Code of Texas) and for listing on the NRHP under Criterion D (under the
NHPA). The SAL-/NRHP-eligible portions of these two sites include approximately the eastern
half of the portion of site 41VV431 as well as all of the portion of site 41VV432 that fall within the
project area. Both sites extend to the north beyond the project area, though Horizon did not
investigate the portions of these sites located outside of the project area. It is Horizon’s opinion
that SAL/NRHP eligibility testing is not warranted to establish the significance of the archeological
deposits on these sites since they have already been determined to be eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP. It is Horizon’s assessment that these archeological deposits retain the characteristics
originally described by Prewitt in 1973 and retain their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP (and for
designation as SALs) and as contributing elements of the San Felipe Creek Archeological District.
While SAL/NRHP eligibility testing may help to define areas of the sites that could most
productively be studied in furtherance of research questions about the prehistoric past,
SAL/NRHP eligibility testing is not recommended at this time to establish significance.
It is Horizon’s assessment that any ground-disturbing activities conducted within the
SAL-/NRHP-eligible archeological deposits on sites 41VV431 and 41VV432 would constitute an
adverse effect to significant cultural resources that are listed on the NRHP, eligible for designation
as SALs, and currently designated as contributing elements of the San Felipe Creek Archeological
District. As such, Horizon recommends that the SAL-/NRHP-eligible portions of these two sites
be avoided and/or placed in preserve and that no construction-related activities occur in this
portion of the project area. Possible avoidance options may include completely avoiding the
eligible portions of the sites, erecting a protective fence and/or warning signage, and/or a program
of filling and capping. In the event that avoidance/preservation is not feasible or desirable,
Horizon recommends that adverse effects to the SAL-/NRHP-eligible deposits on these two sites
that would result from development of the proposed golf course expansion would require
mitigation. Mitigation efforts likely would require some level of data recovery excavations and
analyses of archeological deposits, possibly combined with a program of public outreach and
education.
No further investigations are recommended for the remainder of the project area (i.e.,
beyond the boundaries of the NRHP-eligible archeological deposits on sites 41VV431 and
41VV432). This includes (1) the western half of site 41VV431, which contains only deflated,
surficial cultural materials that are considered to be non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the
site for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; (2) the portion of site 41VV444 that

falls within the southern portion of the project area, which appears to have been effectively
destroyed and does not contain archeological deposits that are considered eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP or for designation as SALs; and (3) the remainder of the project area, in which no
cultural resources were observed on the modern ground surface or in shovel tests.
Furthermore, it should be noted that human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are
protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or
burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery until a qualified archeologist can assess
the find, and the THC should be notified immediately.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), was selected by the City of Del Rio, via
its engineering and environmental permitting contractor, CP&Y, Inc. (CP&Y), to conduct a cultural
resources inventory survey and assessment for the proposed San Felipe Country Club Expansion
Project. The San Felipe Country Club is an existing 9-hole golf course located off the northern
side of US Highway (US) 90 between North Bedell Avenue and San Felipe Springs Road in
eastern Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas. The proposed expansion would involve development
of a currently undeveloped 32.4-hectare (80.0-acre) tract located north of and adjacent to the
existing country club property. For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the project area is
considered to consist of the 32.4-hectare (80.0-acre) expansion tract (Figures 1 to 2).
The proposed project is being sponsored by the City of Del Rio, a political subdivision of
the state of Texas. Consequently, the proposed project falls under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal
permits, funding, or licenses have been identified for the project; however, it is possible that
federal permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act (CWA) may be required. In this case, any portion of the overall project area
covered under the federal permit would also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. As the project represents a
publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact potentially significant cultural
resources, the project sponsor was required to perform a cultural resources inventory and
assessment of the project area.
From March 6 to 8, 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana Smith and archeological
technician Jesse Dalton, under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator,
performed an intensive survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that may be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. The cultural resources investigation consisted of an
archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area, and the production of a report
suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and
cultural backgrounds, respectively, of the project area. Chapter 4.0 describes the results of

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the proposed project area forms part of the Edwards Plateau. The surface
geology of Val Verde County, Texas, consists of sedimentary bedrock derived from deposits of
different geologic periods. The Edwards Plateau is underlain by Cretaceous limestone deposits
of the Comanche and Gulf series (Golden et al. 1982). In general, these limestones are highly
resistant to erosion, but in the vicinity of the junction of the Pecos and Devils rivers with the Rio
Grande, the uplifted and inclined limestone strata are severely eroded and deeply dissected by
narrow stream courses that are bound by steep cliff faces. In recognition of the unique
physiography of this region, it has been termed the Lower Pecos Canyonlands (Hester et al.
1989).
The project area is situated on a combination of alluvial terraces along the western side
of San Felipe Creek and adjacent limestone uplands. Geologically, approximately the western
half of the project area is underlain by the Lower Cretaceous Salmon Peak Limestone Formation
(Ksa), while the eastern half of the project area near San Felipe Creek is situated on Holoceneage alluvium (Qal) (Fisher 1977). Geomorphologically, the project area is composed of a mosaic
of calcareous, gravelly, loamy alluvial sediments, including sediments associated with the
Coahuila, Dev, Reynosa, and Zapata-Vinegarroon soil unites (Table 1; Figure 3). These soils
typically consist of thin, surficial veneer of clay loam, silty clay loam, or gravelly loam overlying
gravelly loam and silty clay loam subsoils.

2.2

HYDROLOGY

The Lower Pecos Canyonlands region lies on the edge of the Pecos River drainage and
includes all of the Devils River drainage, both of which ultimately empty into the Rio Grande.
Generally, the availability of surface water in the region has deteriorated significantly throughout
the past century. Numerous creeks and streams that occasionally carry rainwater traverse the
region and have created a deeply entrenched, rugged topography with a great deal of relief, but
natural springs and artificial wells provide the most reliable sources of water. The nearest source
of water prehistorically would have been San Felipe Creek, which forms the eastern margin of the
project area. There is a group of 10 or more springs extending for more than 1.6 kilometers
(1.0 mile) along San Felipe Creek on the grounds of the San Felipe Country Club and on several

ranches to the north. An unnamed, intermittent tributary of San Felipe Creek flows northwest to
southeast across the project area, discharging into San Felipe Creek in the southern corner of
the project area. A second unnamed, intermittent tributary of San Felipe Creek flows
southeastward through the northeastern portion of the project area, discharging into San Felipe
Creek about 190.0 meters (623.2 feet) south of the northeastern corner of the project area.

2.3

FLORA AND FAUNA

Ecologically, the project area lies within the Balconian biotic province near the boundary
with the Tamaulipan and Chihuahuan provinces (Blair 1950). The most characteristic plant
association of the Balconian province is a scrub forest of Mexican cedar, Texas oak, and scrub
live oak. Much of the project area is covered in dense vegetation, consisting mainly of mesquite,
sagebrush, yucca, prickly pear, and dense tall to short clump grasses, interspersed with patches
of more open vegetation.
The Balconian province is generally confined to the Edwards Plateau and is characterized
by a mixture of faunal elements from the Kansan, Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, and Chihuahuan
biotic provinces. The urban setting of the project area, however, provides poor habitat for wildlife.
No wildlife was observed in the project area during the survey.

2.4

CLIMATE

Val Verde County has a semiarid, continental climate with dry winters and hot summers.
Average annual precipitation is 21.3 centimeters (8.4 inches), while daily temperatures ranges
from an average maximum of 37.3°Celsius (C) (99.2°Fahrenheit [F]) in July to an average
minimum of 3.4°C (38.1°F) in January. Absolute recorded extreme temperatures range from
11.1 to 43.3°C (12.0 to 110.0°F).

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Reconstruction of Late Quaternary paleoenvironment in the vicinity of the project area has
been greatly facilitated by the location of several archeological sites along the Rio Grande and
the Pecos and Devils rivers. These sites include Arenosa Shelter (41VV99), Bonfire Shelter
(41VV218), Baker Cave (41VV213), Centipede Cave (41VV191), Damp Cave (41VV189), Devil’s
Mouth Cave (41VV188), and Hinds Cave (41VV456). Geological, palynological, macrobotanical,
coprolitic, and faunal data from these sites have allowed reconstruction of the paleoenvironment
from the Late Pleistocene through the Holocene (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Patton and Dibble
1982:97-121).
During the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 years before present [B.P.]),
the climate was cooler with more moisture than today. This helped to create a mosaic of
woodlands, pinyon parklands, and scrub grasslands with some juniper present. In the succeeding
Late Glacial period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), a reduction in the pinyon and juniper woodlands is
indicated by the pollen record. Bryant and Holloway (1985:52) suggest that this vegetational
change resulted from a reduced amount of available moisture as a result of changing weather
patterns brought about by glacial retreat.
Between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, the mosaic of vegetation of woodlands, parklands,
and scrub grasslands was gradually replaced by larger areas of scrub grasslands. During this
period, the frequency of fossil pine pollen decreased, while that of herbaceous plants and grasses
increased (Bryant and Holloway 1985:56). Plant remains recovered from Hinds and Baker caves
(Dering 1979) indicate that, by 8,500 B.P., local aboriginal groups were exploiting a full range of
plant resources, including Agave, Yucca, Dasylirion (sotol), and Opuntia, all of which are
associated with xeric environments.
Examination of the plant macrofossil record (Dering 1979), the pollen record (Bryant and
Schafer 1977; Johnson 1963), and the faunal record (Lord 1984) suggests that, by 6,000 B.P.,
aboriginal groups were adjusting to vegetational and climatic conditions that were increasingly
drier (Bryant and Holloway 1985:57). During this same period (7,000 to 4,000 B.P.), southwest
Texas was also subjected to severe flooding as represented in the sediments of archeological
sites such as the Devil’s Mouth Site (Johnson 1964) and Arenosa Shelter (Dibble 1967). Although
the factors behind this erosion and flooding are not fully understood, changes in seasonal rainfall
patterns or shifts in the normal frontal patterns, as have been observed historically, are the
suspected causes.
The pollen record for the past 4,000 years indicates a gradual, but continuous, drying trend
that was interrupted only once, around 2,500 years ago, when increases in the percentages of
pine and grass pollen indicate somewhat cooler and more mesic conditions (Bryant and Holloway
1985). This interval, however, was brief, and the trend toward increased aridity continued until
the present. The landscape as it appears today, however, is not the result of increased aridity
alone. Historical accounts of the early explorers and settlers reveal that the canyon vegetation
and even the upland grasslands were very lush prior to the overgrazing of the region that began
in the late 1880s. The basic subsistence pattern for the aboriginal inhabitants of the region was
therefore probably established as early as 7,000 B.P. and changed very little throughout the
Holocene period.

Proposed 80.0-acre Expansion Tract, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area forms a part of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, which represent a portion
of the Lower Pecos archeological region (Hester et al. 1989). This region includes the area
surrounding the confluences of the Pecos and Devils rivers with the Rio Grande, and it
encompasses the surrounding area of southwestern Texas and north-central Mexico, including
the southwestern extension of the Edwards Plateau and the eastern edge of the Stockton Plateau.
The Lower Pecos archeological region is part of the larger area known as the Trans-Pecos, which
was originally defined as including all of Texas west of the Pecos River plus Val Verde County
(Suhm et al. 1954). Archeologically, the Lower Pecos River region has been defined on the basis
of the distribution of the classic Pecos River style pictographs (Turpin and Bement 1985:5).
The Rio Grande and the Pecos and Devils rivers have incised deep canyons into the
massive Cretaceous limestone deposits in this region, and multiple-canyon systems are quite
common. Erosional processes have also created numerous rockshelters and overhangs, some
of which are quite large, that have facilitated the development of deeply stratified archeological
sites. Most of the best-known sites in the area are located in these dry rockshelters and shallow
erosional cavities along the cliff faces overlooking the rivers (Hester et al. 1989:7).

3.1

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL RESEARCH

The rich prehistoric remains in the Lower Pecos River region have attracted public interest
since before the earliest map makers came to the area in the 1850s (Emory 1857; Young 1853).
Formal archeological investigations here have been restricted to approximately the last 80 years,
beginning in the 1930s with work funded by both private and academic institutions. Much of the
early work was aimed at the recovery of museum-quality specimens from the dry caves and
rockshelters of the area. Archeological investigations in the region have undergone numerous
methodological and theoretical changes within the last 50 years since Amistad Reservoir was
constructed. These more recent studies have attempted to explain the cultural continuity and
change reflected by the artifactual remains of the aboriginal inhabitants rather than to merely seek
out well preserved perishables, as had been done previously.
Excavations begun in the early 1930s were sponsored by various institutions, including
the Witte Museum of San Antonio, the Smithsonian Institution, the University of Texas at Austin,
and Texas Technological University. Key sites excavated during this time period by the Witte
Museum were Eagle Cave (41VV167) near Langtry (Davenport 1938) and the Shumla caves

HJN 170011 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

(41VV112 and 31VV113) near the small settlement of Shumla (Martin 1933). The Smithsonian
Institution promoted excavations at Goat Cave (41VV67) and Moorehead Cave (41VV55) along
the Pecos River throughout the 1930s (Setzler 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1939). Personnel from
the University of Texas at Austin concentrated their efforts in this region on the trenching of Fate
Bell Shelter (41VV74) in Seminole Canyon in 1932 (Pearce and Jackson 1933; Thomas 1933)
and the excavation of Horseshoe Ranch Cave (41VV171) and Kelly Shelter (41VV164) by A.M.
Woolsey in 1936 (Shafer and Zintgraff 1986:228). Also at this time, Murrah Cave (41VV351) on
the Pecos River was excavated as part of Texas Technological University’s fieldwork in the area
(Holden 1937). These early excavations yielded an array of extremely well preserved artifacts,
including wood specimens, mats, baskets, bone tools, sandals, antler implements, and skins, as
well as burials, many of which retained both skin and hair.
Also in the 1930s, several attempts were made to record the rock art in the region. The
first attempt was sponsored by the Witte Museum and was done by Emma Gutzeit and Mary
Virginia Carson in 1931. They crafted free-hand color copies of 18 of the more notable panels in
the area (Turpin 1982:19). Also at this time, Forrest Kirkland, a meticulous artist, and his wife
embarked on a mission to travel across Texas and record as much rock art as possible. Many of
the spectacular pictographs in the Lower Pecos region were included in Kirkland’s work, which
involved painstaking measurements and the use of matched watercolors (Kirkland 1937, 1938,
1939; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967). A.T. Jackson’s (1938) Picture-Writing of Texas Indians was
the first formal archeological study of the pictograph and petroglyph sites in the area. He, like
Kirkland, attempted a systematic documentation of the rock art sites. Jackson’s and Kirkland’s
work laid the groundwork for future research on the remarkable rock art in the Lower Pecos River
region.
During the 1940s, limited formal archeological investigations in the area were undertaken
as a result of World War II. Kelley et al. (1940) divided the Trans-Pecos region into eight cultural
foci based on material recovered from the Big Bend to the Lower Pecos. The Pecos River focus
was one of these foci for which a detailed list of material culture traits was presented. This trait
list was compiled using materials from Fate Bell Shelter, Murrah Cave, Goat Cave, and
Moorehead Cave. Fate Bell Shelter was listed as the type site. One of Kelly’s students, Herbert
Taylor, initiated limited excavations and surveys along both sides of the Rio Grande (Taylor 1948,
1949). After performing a reconnaissance into northern Mexico, Taylor concluded that “Pecos
River Focus sites are to be found south of the Rio Grande near the mouth of the Pecos in virtually
the same locations and numbers in which they occur north of the border” (1948:84). Taylor
proposed that the Pecos River focus was present throughout the Trans-Pecos region, from the
Big Bend to the Lower Pecos, before A.D. 1000. He felt that, around A.D. 1000, this cultural type
abandoned the Big Bend but persisted in the Lower Pecos, creating a long-lived cultural
continuum there (Taylor 1949:86). Suhm et al. (1954) offered a summary of the Lower Pecos
cultural sequence using this background. Their summary placed the Lower Pecos within the
southeastern area of the Trans-Pecos.
The Water Treaty of 1944 between the US and Mexico initiated the next series of
investigations in the Lower Pecos region. This treaty provided for unusual cooperation in the
construction of reservoirs along the Rio Grande to alleviate flooding problems and to allow storage

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the San Felipe Country Club’s
Proposed 80.0-acre Expansion Tract, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

of irrigation water for agricultural areas downstream. One of these reservoirs, Diablo Reservoir
(later renamed Amistad) would inundate an area from the confluence of the Rio Grande with the
Devils River and the Pecos River—and upstream on these two rivers for 48.3 and 32.2 kilometers
(30.0 and 20.0 miles), respectively—to a point about 2.0 kilometers (1.2 miles) downstream on
the Rio Grande. The National Park Service (NPS) was placed in charge of the extensive cultural
resources to be affected by the construction and filling of this reservoir (Bement 1989). The
Archeological Salvage Program Field Office was set up in Austin, Texas (Graham and Davis
1958), and E.B. Jelks of the University of Texas at Austin was put in charge of the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project. The initial inventorying of cultural resources to be adversely
affected by the reservoir began in January 1958 (Jelks 1958). Areal survey, as well as
reconnaissance by raft along the Rio Grande, was used in the identification of sites. This survey
resulted in the recording of 188 archeological sites, of which 49 contained pictographs (Graham
and Davis 1958).
At this time, with the new-found concerns about the archeology of the area, some of the
material excavated in the 1930s was reanalyzed. Mardith Schuertz (1956, 1961, 1963) conducted
the most extensive reevaluations, looking at artifacts from Eagle Cave, the five Shumla caves,
and Jacal Cave (41VV674). She did a thorough study of the recovered sandals, reanalyzed the
projectile points using the formalized typology defined by Suhm et al. (1954), and completed
studies on the wood, bone, antler, stone (pecked, ground, and painted), shell, clay, skins, fiber,
basketry, and matting.
As a result of the 1958 survey of the Amistad Reservoir area, a five-year program was
envisioned to test and excavate many of the recorded sites. This program actually lasted through
the late 1960s with a vast quantity of information being amassed. The first excavations were done
at Centipede Cave (41VV191) and Damp Cave (41VV189) in 1958 by Jeremiah Epstein (1963).
He felt that only the projectile points recovered showed any change through time. The rest of the
artifacts from these two sites showed little variability and were thought to be part of a long-lived
cultural continuum in the area.
Other work associated with the reservoir at this time included additional surveys along the
Pecos, Devils Mouth, and Rio Grande rivers in the US (Parsons 1962) and Mexico (Taylor 1948;
Taylor and Rul 1961); excavations at rockshelters (Alexander 1970; Collins 1969; Dibble 1965;
Nunley et al. 1965; Parsons 1965; Prewitt 1966; Ross 1965) and terrace sites (Dibble 1967;
Johnson 1961, 1964; Sorrow 1968a, 1968b); and additional recording and analyzing of pictograph
sites (Gebhard 1965; Grieder 1965; Parsons 1962).
Dibble’s excavations at Bonfire Shelter (1965) identified four (possibly five) human
utilizations of a bison jump there, with the earliest bone bed possibly due to human involvement
dated to before 10,000 years ago. Alexander’s excavations at Parida Cave (41VV187) along the
Rio Grande recovered human coprolites, identified three extensively used plant taxa (sotol,
lechuguilla, and prickly pear), and noted an increase in the utilization of riverine fauna during Late
Archaic times (Alexander 1970). Eagle Cave was partially excavated in 1963 by Ross (1965),
who developed a projectile point sequence for the site from the Early Archaic through the Late
Archaic. His relative sequence compared favorably with other site sequences from the area.
Most of the projectile point styles, however, occurred chronologically later than had been

HJN 170011 AR

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

hypothesized for the same styles from other sites (Ross 1965:139). Leroy Johnson (1961, 1964)
began work at Devil’s Mouth Cave (41VV188), a deeply stratified alluvial deposit, in the early
1960s. He established a projectile point sequence there identifying a PaleoIndian component
and three subsequent Archaic components. At the same time, Dee Ann Story proposed an eightperiod chronology using radiocarbon dates and associated projectile points from these latest
excavations (Story and Bryant 1966). William Sorrow returned to further excavate the Devil’s
Mouth site in 1967 (Sorrow 1968a) and also did work at the Nopal Terrace site (41VV301) that
same year (Sorrow 1968b). He further refined the cultural sequence for the Amistad area using
Johnson’s Devil’s Mouth data (Story and Bryant 1966) and shorter sequences from seven other
sites in the area. Eight periods were established, with the first seven mirroring the Devil’s Mouth
sequence and the eighth representing the historic period of European contact. The excavations
at Arenosa Shelter (41VV99) by David Dibble (1967) provided the longest cultural sequence of
stratified, radiocarbon-dated episodes from the reservoir to date. Dibble refined an 11-part
chronology for the Lower Pecos region based on the Arenosa sequence and the PaleoIndian data
from Bonfire Shelter.
A relative chronology of the rock art in the area was proposed by David Gebhard in 1960.
He based this chronology on similarities in style and superposition of motifs within a panel (Turpin
1982). His final report in 1965 refined the chronology and included the analysis of additional
panels recorded by Parsons (1962). Terence Grieder (1965) also did some rock art recording at
this time. He visited two sites in Satan Canyon and concluded that all of the painting had been
done within a period of time marked by relatively minor changes in style and that none of the
painting appeared to be of a more recent age than any of the others (Grieder 1965:14).
The reservoir salvage years provided the archeological community with data of
immeasurable value about Lower Pecos prehistory. The absence of large-scale projects since
the salvage program ended has drastically reduced the number of archeological investigations in
this area. Funding for additional surveys and excavations in close proximity to the reservoir has
primarily been provided by grants and research organizations in recent years. The large body of
data from the salvage years in the Lower Pecos enabled some students to complete theses and
dissertations using excavated material (Collins 1974; Marmaduke 1978). Some areas adjacent
to the reservoir were surveyed in the 1970s to further refine the settlement scheme for the area
and to look at the spatial distribution of features (Brown et al. 1976; Marmaduke and Whitsett
1974; Prewitt and Dibble 1974).
Several major rockshelter sites were excavated in the 1970s by academic institutions.
Baker Cave (41VV503) on the Devils River was excavated in the summer of 1976 by the
University of Texas at San Antonio (Chadderdon 1981; Hester 1983). This excavation yielded
both Angostura and Golondrina projectile point types dated to more than 9,000 years ago. The
excavated materials from Baker Cave indicated that lechuguilla and sotol were not part of the
flora during late PaleoIndian times. These plants apparently were not present in the region until
ca. 6000 B.C. (Hester 1983). Texas A&M University conducted excavations at Hinds Cave
(41VV456) along a tributary of the Pecos River over several seasons. This excavation provided
important data concerning the use of the area by the aboriginal occupants and their subsistence
base (Shafer and Bryant 1977). Also, intrasite information was obtained with the discovery of a

12

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the San Felipe Country Club’s
Proposed 80.0-acre Expansion Tract, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

latrine area that provided coprolites for analysis and the location of the areas containing well
preserved floral and faunal remains (Dering 1979; Lord 1984; Williams-Dean 1978). Wellpreserved perishable items, including matting, sandals, and basketry, were found to date back
roughly 5,000 years (Andrews and Adovasio 1980). It was proposed that Hinds Cave was
occupied for extended periods of time lasting several seasons (Shafer 1977; Williams-Dean
1978).
A State Historical Park was created along Seminole and Presa canyons in 1979-1980
when various tracts of land either were donated by landowners or purchased by the state. Many
pictograph sites, including Fate Bell Shelter, were located within the park. The University of Texas
at Austin conducted an inventory of the cultural resources within the park for the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department, locating 38 new sites and reevaluating 32 previously known sites (Turpin
1982). Several new site types were identified during this survey, including signal fire hearths,
oblong burial cairns, and circular stone alignments (i.e., tipi rings) (Turpin 1982, 1984a). One
burial cairn was excavated during this project. A sinkhole, located during this inventory, was later
excavated using funding from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. A rock pile beneath the
vertical shaft entrance to the sinkhole was found to contain the remains of at least 21 individuals
(Bement 1985). This burial population was found to be more than 5,000 years old.
The lower levels of Bonfire Shelter were excavated as part of the 1983-1984 investigations
conducted by the University of Texas at Austin. These excavations explored the PaleoIndian
levels and the levels immediately beneath them. Possible human activities in the shelter between
12,500 and 10,000 B.P. were identified (Bement 1986).
During the 1980s, extensive survey for rock art sites along the three primary rivers in the
area was conducted to provide baseline data for future settlement pattern research (Turpin et al.
n.d.). Another excavation at this time was undertaken at Live Oak Hole (41VV169), a Historic
period aboriginal site (Turpin and Bement 1988). This tipi ring/historic pictograph site contained
brown plainware ceramics, arrow points, Dorso end scrapers, and a Plains-style pictograph. A
continuous circular pile of stones (two stones wide) located on the sloping nose of a creek
meander was excavated, but only a small concentration of burned rock was noted. Oblong cairns
are often associated with such circular alignments, and at this site these cairns were interpreted
as partial rings that had been robbed of stones for the construction of subsequent structures
(Turpin and Bement 1988).
In the mid-1980s, several areas near Hinds Cave were surveyed to develop a subsistence
model for upland areas in the region (Saunders 1986). Saunders concluded that “formal uniface
sites and projectile point sites were associated with separate and distinct economic activities”
(1986:227). He also postulated that large burned rock middens were products of a Middle Archaic
subsistence strategy, while smaller ones represented changing strategies during the Late Archaic
(Saunders 1986:228).
Much emphasis in the 1980s centered on rock art sites in the region (Turpin 1984b, 1986a,
1986b, 1986c, 1986d, 1987, 1988). To date, five pictograph styles have been identified: Pecos
River, Red Linear, Red Monochrome, Bold Line Geometric, and Historic. The Pecos River style
appears to be the earliest and is thought to date to the Middle Archaic, San Felipe phase (3,200 to

HJN 170011 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3,900 years B.P. [Turpin and Bement 1985]). The Red Linear portrays group activities and is
thought to be Late Archaic in age by Turpin (1984b:191-193) due to the lack of bow and arrow
motifs, probable buffalo hunting scenes, and superpositioning over Pecos River style panels. The
Red Monochrome style had been previously dated to the Late Prehistoric period (Kirkland and
Newcomb 1967:84) based on definite bow and arrow depictions. This style is characterized by
naturalistic depictions of humans and animals, with human figures shown facing frontally and
animals drawn in profile (Turpin 1986b). The most recently defined rock art style has been termed
the Bold Line Geometric style (Turpin 1986a). This style is thought to be Late Prehistoric age,
but this hypothesis is tentative. Historic pictographs represent three types of scene: peaceful
depictions of European people and associated material goods, hostilities toward the Spanish, and
hostilities toward Anglo-American settlers (Turpin 1988:283).
The Witte Museum developed a permanent exhibit on the Lower Pecos region using
material from the 1930s excavations at Baker Cave (Bement 1989). The Witte has also
sponsored a book, Ancient Texans (Shafer and Zintgraff 1986), which contains excellent color
plates of many rock art panels as well as the work of many researchers in the Lower Pecos.
In the summer of 1989, the Texas Archeological Society held its annual field school along
the Devils River on newly purchased Texas Parks and Wildlife land. The field school was
designed to help the state inventory the cultural resources present within the approximately
22,000-acre park and to test a number of sites. A total of 158 new sites was recorded, and 37 of
the 52 known sites within the park boundaries were reevaluated. Five sites were tested and/or
excavated, including two rockshelters, one sinkhole/cave, and two midden sites. More recent
archeological studies in the area have consisted of small surveys conducted for cultural resources
management purposes.
In summary, much archeological work has occurred in the Lower Pecos River region in
the last 80 years and has led to the compilation of a vast database for the area. Future work in
the area will undoubtedly build on this database with specific problem-oriented studies dominating
the progress.

3.2

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY IN THE LOWER PECOS RIVER REGION

Numerous researchers have noted an apparent absence of significant technological or
cultural change throughout much of the prehistoric period in the Lower Pecos River region, with
the continuation of an “Archaic” mode of adaptation from the end of the PaleoIndian period at
about 7000 B.C. to the Historic period (Saunders 1986; Turpin 1982). Throughout this long period
of time, the economy was apparently based on collecting plant and shellfish resources along with
hunting small animals and large game.
Because of the excellent preservation conditions in the dry rockshelters, which were
apparently intermittently occupied throughout the prehistoric period, we have a relatively complete
inventory of the material culture of the prehistoric inhabitants. This inventory includes baskets,
various types of netting, bone tools, a wide variety of woven goods, such as bags and sandals,
“middens” of burned rock that are presumed to relate to the preparation of plant foods, and a large
assemblage of lithic tools.

14

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the San Felipe Country Club’s
Proposed 80.0-acre Expansion Tract, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

The perception of the conservative nature of this tradition derives largely from the lithic
industry, which consists of projectile points, bifaces, and unifacial tools. With the exception of
projectile point styles, the lithic assemblage changed little throughout most of the prehistoric
period (Saunders 1986). The most important shift in technology may have occurred around
A.D. 600, when the bow and arrow was introduced into the region, apparently accompanied by a
change in the morphological structure of burned rock middens (Saunders 1986).
As is to be expected given this apparent pattern of cultural conservatism, chronology in
the Lower Pecos River region is based almost entirely on the stylistic seriation of projectile points
that have been excavated from rockshelters and deeply stratified terrace sites in the canyons.
Such sites have provided a rather consistent sequence of projectile point styles that can be
bracketed by radiocarbon dates (Marmaduke 1978:Fig. 18). For our purposes, four major periods
of Native American occupation can be defined: PaleoIndian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Historic (Saunders 1986; Turpin and Bement 1985). The following discussion of these cultural
periods is, of necessity, brief and is limited only to the major innovations or traits that can be firmly
associated with specific points in time.
3.2.1

PaleoIndian Period (ca. 10,000 to 7000 B.C.)

Two phases have been defined for the PaleoIndian period in the Lower Pecos River
region: the Aurora (pre-10,000 B.C.) and the Bonfire (10,000 to 7800 B.C.) phases (Saunders
1986; Turpin and Bement 1985). Evidence for the Aurora phase is rather circumstantial,
consisting only of scattered, broken, or burned bones of extinct Pleistocene fauna recovered from
two rockshelter sites: Cueva Quebrada (41VV162A) (Collins 1976; Lundelius 1984) and Bonfire
Shelter (Bement 1986; Dibble 1970; Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Turpin and Bement 1985:6).
Formal tools and features are lacking from these deposits, and the only evidence for human
activity lies in the burning of the bones and the nature of the breakage patterns. Unfortunately,
such evidence elsewhere has often proved illusory and firm evidence for the existence of this
phase remains to be discovered. Radiocarbon dates associated with this phase range from
12,000 to 10,000 B.C. at Cueva Quebrada and from 10,500 to 8000 B.C. at Bonfire Shelter
(Turpin and Bement 1985:6).
The later phase of the PaleoIndian period, the Bonfire phase, is well represented only at
Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). A massive bone deposit of extinct Bison antiquus and
Equus sp. at this site has yielded radiocarbon dates of 10,000 years ago. The site is estimated
to contain the remains of 120 animals that were driven from the overhanging cliff in at least three
separate episodes. Two distinctive PaleoIndian point types were found in association with these
remains: Folsom and Plainview. Other sites in the region that have yielded remains of Bison
antiquus include Arenosa Shelter and Cueva Quebrada (Turpin and Bement 1985:8). Based on
this evidence, the Lower Pecos River region has been suggested to have been part of a larger
economic pattern of “big game hunting” that was found across much of the western US at this
time. PaleoIndian projectile points of this phase have also been found at Devil’s Mouth Cave in
a context suggestive of an open camping area (Turpin and Bement 1985:6-8).
The period from about 7800 to 7000 B.C. has been placed in the Oriente phase, also
termed “Pre-Archaic” (Turpin and Bement 1985:8). The type site for this “terminal” PaleoIndian

HJN 170011 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

manifestation is Baker Cave, where Golondrina and Angostura points were found in contexts that
show little difference from those of the subsequent Archaic period (Chadderdon 1983; Word and
Douglas 1970). Apparently, by this time, the broad-spectrum, “Archaic” subsistence pattern that
was to characterize the Lower Pecos region for the next 10,000 years was already in place.
Turpin and Bement (1985:8) note that the onset of the dry, post-Pleistocene climatic conditions
was signaled by the appearance of desert succulents, such as prickly pear, as a dietary mainstay.
Work at Hinds Cave as well as Saunders’s (1986) survey data in the surrounding region show
that canyon, upland, and interior upland environments were all being exploited by this time period.
3.2.2

Early Archaic Period (ca. 7000 to 4000 B.C.)

Turpin and Bement (1985:8) have defined the Viejo phase for the Early Archaic period in
the Lower Pecos region. This is the period when the full range of Archaic traits appears in the
dry rockshelters in the region. Specifically, they refer to burned rock middens, hearths, slab- and
grass-lined pits, prickly pear floors, and refuse dumps as being present in several sites, including
Eagle Cave (41VV167) and Hinds Cave (Andrews and Adovasio 1980; Parsons 1965; Shafer and
Bryant 1977; Stock 1983). They also note the appearance at this time of basketry, cordage and
sandals, and the first painted pebbles. Characteristic projectile points of the Viejo phase include
Baker, Bandy, Uvalde, Gower, Martindale, and the Early Barbed series (Turpin and Bement
1985:8).
Coprolite data support an increasing dietary emphasis on vegetation, small animals, and
reptiles, in comparison to the preceding phase. The diet now included agave, sotol, and yucca
plants, as well as selected rodent parts. Saunders’s upland survey data failed to record any
evidence for Early Archaic utilization of these areas, but the remains of upland plants and animals
from Hinds Cave shows that these areas must have been utilized (Saunders 1986:228).
Saunders suggests that the more remote upland areas were not utilized as frequently at this time
as they were in later periods.
3.2.3

Middle Archaic Period (ca. 4000 to 1200 B.C.)

The Middle Archaic period has been divided into two periods: the Eagle Nest phase
(4000 to 1900 B.C.) and the San Felipe phase (1900 to 1200 B.C.). The period defined as the
Eagle Nest phase is now placed in the Middle Archaic period on the basis of the occurrence of
Pandale points (Dibble 1967) and of a pattern of increasing regionalization of traits (Turpin
1982:24; Turpin and Bement 1985:9). Coprolite data reveal an increasing reliance on desert
vegetation and fauna (Williams-Dean 1978), while the dry shelter deposits dating to this period
contain the full range of fiber, wood, bone, and flint industries.
The San Felipe phase (1900 to 1200 B.C.) continues this pattern of regionalization and is
characterized by Langtry, Val Verde, Arledge, and Almagre dart points (Turpin and Bement
1985:9). Turpin and Bement (1985:9) feel that the classic Pecos River rock art style should be
placed in this phase. The subsistence economy mirrors that of the preceding Eagle Nest phase,
although there may have been a shift in some sites toward riverine and upland resources
exploitation.

3.2.4

Late Archaic Period (ca. 1200 B.C. to A.D. 950)

The Late Archaic period has been subdivided into three cultural phases by Turpin and
Bement (1985:9-10): the Cibola phase (1200 to 400 B.C.), the Flanders phase (400 B.C. to
A.D. 200), and the Blue Hills phase (A.D. 200 to 950). The Cibola phase appears to have
occupied a short mesic interlude within the overall trend toward increasing aridity in the Lower
Pecos River region. Bison apparently extended their range southward during this phase, and
northern hunters from the Llano Estacado and Central Texas followed them into the area (Turpin
and Bement 1985:9). The bison jump at Bonfire Shelter was utilized again during this phase, and
characteristic projectile point types include Montell, Castroville, and Marshall. Turpin and Bement
(1985:9) have tentatively placed the Red Linear rock art style within this cultural phase based on
the depiction of bison hunting. Interestingly, domestic dogs are also shown in these paintings at
the same time that canid bones reach a peak in Arenosa Shelter (Turpin and Bement 1985:9).
Projectile point types representative of this phase include Montell, Castroville, and Marshall dart
points.
The subsequent Flanders phase saw the resumption of the previous arid trend in the
Lower Pecos River region and the retreat of the bison back to the north. This apparently
encouraged a return to the “desert-adapted” economy of the Middle Archaic. Turpin and Bement
(1985:9-10) suggest that the lack of continuity during the previous phase was the result of an
intrusive culture, and the resurgence of the earlier pattern is the result of renewed visibility rather
than abrupt cultural change. Dart point types characteristic of this phase include Shumla and
Marcos. Turpin and Bement (1985:10) state that “few distinctive or innovative traits beyond the
characteristic projectile point styles can be securely attributed to this phase.”
The final phase of the Late Archaic period is the Blue Hills phase. This phase witnessed
an intensification of the traditional “desert life-style” of the earlier periods. Sharp increases in
percentages of unifaces are interpreted as indicating an increased emphasis on vegetal
processing. The occurrence of silica sheen on some of these tools would tend to support this
view (Turpin and Bement 1985:10). In addition, there is some evidence for a heavier reliance on
riverine resources (especially fish) during this phase, although this may be more a result of better
preservation than of an actual change in emphasis. Ring middens first appear at this time and
have been interpreted as the remains of burned rock ovens used for the preparation of desert
succulents. Projectile point styles characteristic of this period include the Frio and Ensor types.
There is an elaboration of the fiber industry that incorporated patterned and painted matting and
basketry. Such artifacts were often intended as funerary goods. Burials were usually bundled
and placed in rockshelters, bound and wrapped in shrouds of hide and matting. Finally, stone
features that may be the remnants of supports for huts covered with hide and grass may date to
this phase.
3.2.5

Late Prehistoric Period (ca. A.D. 950 to 1700)

The Late Prehistoric period is divided into the Flecha phase (A.D. 950 to 1500), belonging
to the Late Prehistoric proper, and the protohistoric Infierno phase (A.D. 1500 to 1700). As noted
above, the bow and arrow were introduced into the Lower Pecos River region sometime after
A.D. 600, as indicated by the characteristic point types of the Flecha phase—initially Scallorn and

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Perdiz arrow points, followed by Livermore and Toyah (Turpin and Bement 1985:10).
Rockshelters continued to be occupied during this phase, but there may have been a preference
for upland settlement. Mortuary customs may have shifted to include cairn burial in the uplands,
and circular stone rings can be positively attributed to this phase. Turpin and Bement (1985:10)
feel that the distinctive Red Monochrome pictograph style was introduced during this phase, or
possibly later. Turpin and Bement conclude that, “taken in composite, the attributes of this phase
reflect considerable cultural mobility, most probably effected by the movements of people rather
than diffusion” (1985:10).
The Infierno phase has been referred to as protohistoric based on what appears to be a
completely different artifact assemblage in comparison to earlier assemblages characteristic of
the Lower Pecos River region (Turpin and Bement 1985:10). This artifact assemblage includes
small, triangular arrow points, plain brownware ceramics (some with bone temper), steeply
beveled Dorso end scrapers, and prismatic blades. This material is typically found at stone circle
sites and resembles assemblages from the margins of the Southern Plains more than any
preceding indigenous complex. It has been suggested that this phase reflects a period of cultural
unrest and change during the Late Prehistoric and early Historic periods (Turpin and Bement
1985:10-11). Turpin and Bement feel that some of the late-style monochrome pictographs may
be attributable to the Infierno phase (1985:10).
3.2.6

Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700 to 1850)

The “official” end of the prehistoric period in the Lower Pecos River region can be set at
1590 when the expedition of Gaspar Castaño de Sosa passed through the area on its passage
from Monclova to Pecos (Turpin 1982; Turpin and Bement 1985:11). Serious Anglo-American
penetration of the region began in the mid-1800s, brought about by the need for trade and military
routes (Turpin 1982:29). The area was mapped in 1857 as a result of the Unites States-Mexico
Boundary survey. Attempts to control the region culminated with the construction of the military
road from the Devil’s River to the Pecos to the mouth of the Pecos in 1880. This same route was
followed by the Southern Pacific Railroad two years later in 1882. As is the case in many areas
of the west, the archeological visibility of historic Native American populations, such as the
Apache and later the Comanche, is extremely low. The presence of such groups may only be
revealed by occasional metal arrow points and in the Historic pictograph style, depicting missions,
domestic livestock, and European or Anglo human figures. Turpin and Bement (1985:11) suggest
that “the paucity of sites of this age can be attributed to the short span of this phase and to the
extremely mobile lifeways of these refugees from colonization.”

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) for information on previously recorded cultural
resources sites and historic properties in and near the proposed project area as well as previous
cultural resources investigations conducted in the vicinity of the proposed project area. Based on
this archival research, 13 previously recorded archeological sites and one historic district listed
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are present within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile)
radius of the project area (Figure 4; Table 2). Portions of three of the known archeological sites—
41VV431, 41VV432, and 41VV444—fall within the boundaries of the project area. The rest of the
sites are located well beyond the boundaries of the project area and would have no potential to
experience any disturbances as a result of the proposed undertaking. In addition, approximately
the eastern half of the project area falls within the boundaries of the San Felipe Creek
Archeological District, a historic district listed on the NRHP (see Figure 4; see Table 2). The San
Felipe Creek Archeological District is composed of 13 archeological sites that were recorded by
Elton Prewitt in 1973 during the San Felipe Creek Watershed Project. The historic district was
nominated for and listed on the NRHP in 1974. Two of the previously recorded archeological
sites within the current project area—41VV431 and 41VV432—have been determined to be
eligible for listing on the NRHP and are contributing elements of the historic district. The third site
within the project area—41VV444—has also been determined to be eligible for listing on the
NRHP but is not a contributing element of the historic district.
Located a short distance east of the project area is an Official Texas Historical Marker
(OTHM) designating the location of San Felipe Springs (OTHM No. 4534), which bears the
following inscription:
SAN FELIPE SPRINGS—Oasis for explorers, soldiers, freighters—from 1542 onward. In
1675 priests named the 7 Springs for King of Spain. In 18th Century Comanches camped
here on their war trail into Mexico. In 1808 a mission was established 3 miles downstream,
on San Felipe Creek. By 1856-57, Springs were on the 1470-mile San Antonio-to-San
Diego mail route and on Chihuahua road for wagons hauling silver and gold from Mexico
to Inidanola [sic], then Chief Port on Texas Coast. After settlers came in 1864, irrigation
“Mother Ditch” was dug; soon Del Rio was founded. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark,
1966.

While OTHMs do not, in and of themselves, constitute cultural resources warranting evaluation
under applicable heritage preservation regulations, they do serve to highlight areas of historical
interest.
Approximately the eastern half of the project area, roughly equivalent to the portion of the
project area that is overlapped by the San Felipe Creek Archeological District, was surveyed by
Elton Prewitt in 1974 during the San Felipe Creek Watershed Project (Prewitt and Dibble 1974)
(see Figure 4). It was during this survey that sites 41VV431 and 41VV432, two of the three sites
located within the current project area, were initially recorded.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

From March 6 to 8, 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana Smith and archeological
technician Jesse Dalton, under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator,
performed an intensive survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that may be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the project area on foot
and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources.
The project area is currently in use as an archery range. The main archery range is
located near the center of the project area (Figure 5). Two-track roads and walking paths circle
around the range, radiating out from them and leading to areas where targets are located
(Figures 6 to 7). The majority of the project area is covered in dense vegetation, consisting mainly
of mesquite, sagebrush, yucca, prickly pear, and dense short to tall clump grasses, interspersed
with more open areas (Figures 8 to 9). San Felipe Creek flows southwards along the eastern
margin of the project area (Figure 10), and an unnamed, intermittent tributary of San Felipe Creek
flows southeastwards across the project area, discharging into San Felipe Creek in the southern
portion of the project area. The area surrounding the confluence of the two creeks is very poorly
drained, and a large pool of standing water covers much of the surrounding area. The southern
portion of the project area nearest to the existing golf course was found to be extensively
disturbed, apparently from various construction activities on the golf course. Disturbances
observed in this area include large, overgrown piles of limestone cobbles and boulders, patches
of artificial fill in some areas, and a long, open trench that was probably excavated for a
subsurface utility line (Figures 11 to 12). Bulldozers were actively working on various brushclearing and earth-moving activities in this portion of the project area during the survey.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 0.4 hectares (2.0 acres) within
project areas measuring between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11.0 and 100.0 acres) in size. As such,
40 shovel tests would be required within the 32.4-hectare (80.0-acre) project area. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 49 shovel tests (Figure 13). The pedestrian
survey with shovel testing revealed silty loam and silty clay loam sediments overlying clay at
average depths ranging from 50.0 to 70.0 centimeters (19.7 to 27.6 inches) below surface. The
underlying clay subsoil was encountered at shallower depths ranging from 30.0 to
55.0 centimeters (11.8 to 21.7 inches) in many shovel tests, primarily in the western portion of the
project area. The overlying silty loam and silty clay loam sediments extended below depths of

90.0 to 100.0 centimeters (35.4 to 39.4 inches) in a few shovel tests, mainly in the eastern portion
of the project area nearer to San Felipe Creek. Limestone bedrock was observed on the modern
ground surface in some areas. Scattered modern trash piles were observed within the central
and southern portions of the project area.
Three previously recorded sites located within the project area—41VV431, 41VV432, and
41VV444—were reinvestigated during the survey. In the field, standard site recording forms were
used to record pertinent information on location, physiographic setting, and local environmental
characteristics; types and quantities of artifacts observed; distribution and densities of artifacts;
artificial and natural impacts; and the condition of surface and subsurface archeological deposits.
Scaled sketch maps were drawn that illustrated site boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural
features, and/or material concentrations; as well as notable features of the landscape. The sites
were thoroughly photo-documented using color digital photography, and photographic logs were
maintained of all photographs taken. Based on the information recorded on the standard
archeological site recording forms in the field, Texas Archeological Data Site Update Forms were
completed by Horizon’s laboratory personnel using the most current version of the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL) TexSite archeological data collection software, and
the forms were submitted to TARL to update the existing site files.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log
was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural resources were collected during the survey.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Portions of three previously recorded archeological sites are located within the project
area—41VV431, 41VV432, and 41VV444—that were reinvestigated during the survey
(Figure 14). These sites were originally recorded by Elton Prewitt in 1973 and 1974 during the
San Felipe Watershed Project survey and during a follow-up undertaking. As originally recorded,
all three sites consisted of scatters of aboriginal midden deposits, including burned rocks, chipped
stone artifacts, and scattered hearth features, dating from the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric
periods. Site 41VV444 additionally contained a historic-era structure, the San Felipe Springs
Pumphouse, a municipal water supply structure constructed in the early 20th century. Each site
is described separately below.

6.1

SITE 41VV431

Site 41VV431 was originally described by Prewitt as an aboriginal campsite consisting of
scattered thin, grey, ashy midden deposits; apparently intact burned rock hearths; and burned
rocks and chipped stone debris. A single Ensor projectile point was observed, suggesting a Late
Archaic period occupation.
Archeological deposits extending to depths of 30.0 to
40.0 centimeters (11.8 to 15.7 inches) below surface were noted. The site was recorded on the
floodplain and alluvial terraces on the western side of San Felipe Creek. The original site
dimensions are not noted on the site form, and the site is mapped on the THC’s TASA only with
a site centroid point. An unscaled sketch map was filed with the original site form; however, this
sketch map actually appears to be for site 41VV432. Site 41VV431 has been determined to be
eligible for listing on the NRHP and is one of the 13 archeological sites that has been designated
as a contributing element of the San Felipe Creek Archeological District.
As documented during Horizon’s investigations, site 41VV431 occupies much of the
northern half of the project area, measuring approximately 435.0 meters (1,426.8 feet) east to
west by 250.0 meters (820.0 feet) north to south (Figure 15; also see Figure 14). The site is
bounded by an unnamed tributary of San Felipe Creek on the east, and the site appears to extend
beyond the northern and western boundaries of the project area. The southern site boundary has
been delineated within the project area based on the distribution of cultural materials on the
modern ground surface and in subsurface shovel tests. Approximately the eastern half of the site
is situated on the floodplain and terraces of San Felipe Creek, and the western half of the site
extends up onto the neighboring limestone uplands. Vegetation on the site is relatively dense,
especially in the eastern and central portions of the site, consisting of mesquite, sagebrush,

yucca, prickly pear, and tall to short clump grasses, interspersed with patches of more open
vegetation (Figures 16 to 17). Elevations across the site range from roughly 292.7 to
307.9 meters (960.0 to 1,010.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl). Drainage is to the southeast
toward San Felipe Creek, primarily via overland sheet flow.
Horizon’s archeologists were unable to identify the surficial midden deposits or gray ash
stains described by Prewitt due to dense grass cover resulting from recent rains. However, dense
burned rock accumulations were observed within the southeastern portion of the site as well as
on an eroded upland in the southwestern portion of the site (see Figure 15), and scattered burned
rocks and lithic debitage were observed on the modern ground surface across the entire site.
Horizon excavated a total of 21 shovel tests within the final delineated site boundaries of
site 41VV431, 8 of which yielded subsurface cultural resources (see Figure 15). All 8 of the
positive shovel tests are located in the eastern half of the site, where subsurface archeological
deposits extend from depths of 10.0 to 70.0 centimeters (3.9 to 27.6 inches) below surface.
Archeological materials in the western half of the site appear to be restricted to deflated contexts
on the modern ground surface (Figures 18 to 21).
Cultural materials observed on site 41VV431 during Horizon’s survey include burned
rocks, lithic debitage, small chunks of wood charcoal, and Rabdotus snail shells (Figure 22).
Burned rocks are by far the most common artifact type observed on the site. No faunal remains
were observed, though the preservation of wood charcoal suggests that there is potential for intact
faunal materials to be present. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed during Horizon’s
investigations, so Prewitt’s original assessment of at least a Late Archaic period occupation based
on the recovery of a single Ensor projectile point remains the only available estimate of the
timeframe of habitation. No intact cultural features were observed on the site, though the
presence of moderately dense to dense deposits of burned rocks in subsurface contexts and in
areas of concentration on the modern ground surface, together with the presence of preserved
chunks of wood charcoal in association with subsurface burned rock deposits, suggests that there
is a relatively high potential for intact cultural features to be present on the site.
The western portion of site 41VV431 consists only of a surficial scatter of archeological
materials in an upland setting in deflated contexts lacking integrity. It is Horizon’s opinion that
this portion of site 41VV431 is non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the site for designation
as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and for inclusion in the NRHP. Based on the presence of
apparently intact, subsurface archeological deposits in the eastern portion of the site, it is
Horizon’s opinion that this portion of the site retains the characteristics that originally established
the significance of the site, its eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP, and its designation as a
contributing element of the San Felipe Creek Archeological District. In fact, it is likely that Prewitt’s
1973 investigations were limited to this eastern portion of the site.
Aboriginal sites containing archeological deposits of the depth and apparent integrity such
as those observed in the eastern portion of site 41VV431 are relatively rare in South Texas and
have the potential to enhance our understanding of the prehistoric past; as such, this portion of
the sites is eligible for designation as an SAL under Criterion 4 of 13 TAC 26 (Part 2,
Subchapter C, Rule §26.10) (under the Antiquities Code of Texas) and for listing on the NRHP

under Criterion D (under the NHPA). It is Horizon’s opinion that NRHP eligibility testing is not
warranted to establish the significance of the archeological deposits in the eastern half of site
41VV431 since they have already been determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. It is
Horizon’s assessment that the archeological deposits in the eastern half of the site retain the
characteristics originally described by Prewitt in 1973 and that this portion of the site retains its
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP (and for designation as an SAL). While NRHP eligibility testing
may help to define areas of the site that could most productively be studied in furtherance of
research questions about the prehistoric past, NRHP eligibility testing is not recommended at this
time to establish significance.

6.2

SITE 41VV432

Site 41VV432 was originally described by Prewitt as an aboriginal campsite consisting of
scattered thin, grey, ashy midden deposits; apparently intact burned rock hearths; and burned
rocks and chipped stone debris. In fact, site 41VV432 and neighboring site 41VV431 to the west
(see above) consist of similar archeological deposits and are separated only by an unnamed
tributary of San Felipe Creek; as such, the two sites may represent the same aboriginal
occupation or series of occupations. As described by Prewitt, archeological deposits on site
41VV432 extended to depths of 40.0 to 50.0 centimeters (15.7 to 19.7 inches) below surface
within the southern one-third of the site (i.e., roughly the portion of the site within the current
project area). Archeological materials within the northern two-thirds of the site (i.e., the portion of
the site north of the current project area) were described as very thinly scattered pockets of

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the San Felipe Country Club’s
Proposed 80.0-acre Expansion Tract, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

midden debris and scattered hearth features. The site was recorded as occupying an interfluve
between San Felipe Creek on the east and an unnamed, intermittent tributary of San Felipe Creek
on the west. As noted on the site form, the site extends 300.0 to 400.0 meters (984.0 to
1,312.0 feet) northward from the confluence of these two streams. An unscaled sketch map of
site 41VV432 was inadvertently filed with the original site form for adjacent site 41VV431 that
roughly approximates the known dimensions and location of site 41VV432. Site 41VV432 has
been determined to be eligible for listing on the NRHP and is one of the 13 archeological sites
that has been designated as a contributing element of the San Felipe Creek Archeological District.
As documented during Horizon’s investigations, site 41VV432 occupies the upland
interfluve between San Felipe Creek and one of its unnamed, intermittent tributaries to the east
and west respectively, measuring approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) east to west by
165.0 meters (541.2 feet) north to south (Figure 23; also see Figure 14). The eastern and
western site boundaries are defined by San Felipe Creek and its unnamed tributary, respectively,
and the southern site boundary is formed by the confluence of these two streams. The site
extends beyond the northern boundary of the project area. Vegetation on the site is relatively
dense, consisting of mesquite, sagebrush, yucca, prickly pear, and tall to short clump grasses,
interspersed with patches of more open vegetation (Figures 24 to 25). Elevations across the site
range from roughly 292.7 to 300.3 meters (960.0 to 985.0 feet) amsl. Drainage is to the east,
west, and south toward San Felipe Creek and its tributary, primarily via overland sheet flow.
Horizon’s archeologists were unable to identify the surficial midden deposits or gray ash
stains described by Prewitt due to dense grass cover resulting from recent rains in many areas.
However, dense burned rock accumulations were observed within shovel tests excavated on the
site, and scattered burned rocks and lithic debitage were observed on the modern ground surface
across the investigated site area.
Horizon excavated a total of three shovel tests within the small portion of site 41VV432
that falls within the project area, all of which yielded subsurface cultural resources extending to
depths of 40.0 to 50.0 centimeters (15.7 to 19.7 inches) below surface (see Figure 23).
Cultural materials observed on site 41VV432 during Horizon’s survey include burned
rocks, lithic debitage, small chunks of wood charcoal, and Rabdotus snail shells (Figures 26
to 27). Burned rocks are by far the most common artifact type observed on the site. No faunal
remains were observed, though the preservation of wood charcoal suggests that there is potential
for intact faunal materials to be present. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed during
Horizon’s investigations, and none were noted on Prewitt’s original site form; as such, the site can
be dated only to an undetermined prehistoric timeframe at present. No intact cultural features
were observed on the site, though the presence of moderately dense to dense deposits of burned
rocks in subsurface contexts, together with the presence of preserved chunks of wood charcoal
in association with subsurface burned rock deposits, suggests that there is a relatively high
potential for intact cultural features to be present on the site.
Aboriginal archeological sites containing archeological deposits of the depth and apparent
integrity such as those observed on site 41VV432 are relatively rare in South Texas and have the
potential to enhance our understanding of the prehistoric past; as such, the portion of site

41VV432 within the project area is eligible for designation as an SAL under Criterion 4 of 13 TAC
26 (Part 2, Subchapter C, Rule §26.10) (under the Antiquities Code of Texas) and for listing on
the NRHP as defined under Criterion D of the NRHP. It is Horizon’s opinion that SAL/NRHP
eligibility testing is not warranted to establish the significance of the archeological deposits on site
41VV432 since they have already been determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. It is
Horizon’s assessment that the archeological deposits on site 41VV432 retain the characteristics
originally described by Prewitt in 1973 and that the portion of the site located within the project
area retains its eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP (and for designation as an SAL) and for
designation as a contributing element of the San Felipe Creek Archeological District. While NRHP
eligibility testing may help to define areas of the site that could most productively be studied in
furtherance of research questions about the prehistoric past, NRHP eligibility testing is not
recommended at this time to establish significance.

6.3

SITE 41VV444

Site 41VV444 was originally recorded by an avocational archeologist in 1973 as an
aboriginal lithic artifact scatter. Elton Prewitt revisited the site in 1974 and filed a follow-up site
form, on which he added that the site contained aboriginal Pandale dart points and arrow points
(including Perdiz and others), which would broadly indicate prehistoric occupations dating from
the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods. Aboriginal archeological deposits on site 41VV444
extended to a maximum depth of 50.0 centimeters (19.7 inches) below surface and included dart
and arrow points as well as burned rocks, chipped stone tools, lithic debitage, and one
groundstone tool. During a subsequent revisit to the site in 1997 by Prewitt & Associates, Inc.
(PAI), a historic-age component was recognized in addition to the previously identified prehistoric
component. The historic-age component consists of the San Felipe Springs Pumphouse, a
municipal water storage structure constructed by the city of Del Rio in the 1920s. The pumphouse
is located on the western side of the golf course outside the boundaries of the current project area
(Figure 28). Site 41VV444 was not designated as a contributing element of the San Felipe Creek
Archeological District, though it has also been determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
based on numerous eligibility reviews conducted between 1998 and 2000.
Based on Prewitt’s original investigations, site 41VV444 covers a large area in the
northern section of the San Felipe County Club and golf course and falls mainly to the south of
the current project area (see Figure 14). However, a small, northern extension of the site falls
within the southern corner of the project area. As originally mapped, the portion of site 41VV444
that falls within the current project area measures approximately 190.0 meters (623.2 feet) east
to west by 70.0 meters (229.6 feet) north to south (Figure 29). Horizon inspected the portion of
the site within the current project area, though the portion of the site located on the golf course to
the south was not examined. Of the portion of the site within the current project area, Horizon
found that the western half of the site area was inundated by a large pool of water surrounding
the confluence of San Felipe Creek and one of its unnamed tributaries, which discharges into the
creek from the northwest (Figure 30). The eastern half of the site area exhibited extensive signs
of disturbance, including large piles of limestone boulders and soils (Figures 31 to 32); patches
of artificial fill; and a long, open trench that was probably excavated for a subsurface utility line
(Figure 33). Bulldozers were actively working on various brush-clearing and earth-moving

activities in this portion of the project area during the survey. The profiles of the open trench were
examined for cultural resources, but the trench appeared to have been excavated entirely through
bedrock gravels, and no cultural resources were observed. Horizon’s archeologists attempted to
locate less disturbed areas within the site suitable for shovel testing, but could find none. As a
result, no shovel tests were excavated on site 41VV444. Vegetation on the site is relatively dense,
consisting of mesquite, sagebrush, yucca, prickly pear, and tall to short clump grasses,
interspersed with patches of more open vegetation. Elevations across the site range from roughly
289.6 to 300.3 meters (950.0 to 994.2 feet) amsl. Drainage is to the east, west, and south toward
San Felipe Creek and its tributary, primarily via overland sheet flow.
No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were observed within the small northern
margin of site 41VV444 that falls within the southern portion of the project area. It is Horizon’s
opinion that this portion of site 41VV444 has been effectively destroyed. It is also possible that
the portion of site 41VV444 shown on the THC’s TASA as falling within the current project area’s
boundaries is not accurately mapped and that the site does not, in fact, extend this far north. The
site as a whole has been determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. However, due to
the existing disturbances observed by Horizon, the investigated portion of the site is
recommended as non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the remaining portion of the site
located to the south of the project area within the boundaries of the existing San Felipe Country
Club for inclusion in the NRHP (and for designation as an SAL). No further investigations are
recommended on site 41VV444 in connection with the proposed undertaking.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or federal
codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a
function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs, though
historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important historic events
and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs, respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

Proposed 80.0-acre Expansion Tract, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.3

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

Portions of three previously recorded archeological sites are located within the project
area—41VV431, 41VV432, and 41VV444—that were reinvestigated during the survey (Table 3).
These sites were originally recorded by Elton Prewitt in 1973 and 1974 during the San Felipe
Watershed Project survey and during a follow-up undertaking. As originally recorded, all three
sites consisted of scatters of aboriginal midden deposits, including burned rocks, chipped stone
artifacts, and scattered hearth features, dating from the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods.
Site 41VV444 additionally contained a historic-era structure, the San Felipe Springs Pumphouse,

a municipal water supply structure constructed in the early 20th century. The pumphouse is
located on the western side of the golf course to the south of the project area and would not be
disturbed as a result of the proposed undertaking. Sites 41VV431 and 41VV432 were designated
as contributing elements of the San Felipe Creek Archeological District along with 11 other sites
recorded along San Felipe Creek to the north of the current project area. The San Felipe Creek
Archeological District is a historic district that was listed on the NRHP in 1974. Site 41VV444 was
not designated as a contributing element of the San Felipe Creek Archeological District, though it
has also been determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP based on numerous eligibility
reviews conducted between 1998 and 2000 despite prior disturbances from construction of the
golf course.
Based on Horizon’s investigations, portions of previously recorded sites 41VV431 and
41VV432 contain archeological deposits that have the potential to enhance our understanding of
the prehistoric past; as such, these portions of the sites are eligible for designation as SALs under
Criterion 4 of 13 TAC 26 (Part 2, Subchapter C, Rule §26.10) (under the Antiquities Code of
Texas) and for listing on the NRHP under Criterion D (under the NHPA). The SAL-/NRHP-eligible
portions of these two sites include approximately the eastern half of the portion of site 41VV431
as well as all of the portion of site 41VV432 that fall within the project area (see Figure 14). Both
sites extend to the north beyond the project area, though Horizon did not investigate the portions
of these sites located outside of the project area. It is Horizon’s opinion that SAL/NRHP eligibility
testing is not warranted to establish the significance of the archeological deposits on these sites
since they have already been determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. It is Horizon’s
assessment that these archeological deposits retain the characteristics originally described by
Prewitt in 1973 and retain their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP (and for designation as SALs)
and as contributing elements of the San Felipe Creek Archeological District. While SAL/NRHP
eligibility testing may help to define areas of the sites that could most productively be studied in
furtherance of research questions about the prehistoric past, SAL/NRHP eligibility testing is not
recommended at this time to establish significance.

7.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

It is Horizon’s assessment that any ground-disturbing activities conducted within the
SAL-/NRHP-eligible archeological deposits on sites 41VV431 and 41VV432 would constitute an
adverse effect to significant cultural resources that are listed on the NRHP, eligible for designation
as SALs, and currently designated as contributing elements of the San Felipe Creek Archeological
District. As such, Horizon recommends that the SAL-/NRHP-eligible portions of these two sites
be avoided and/or placed in preserve and that no construction-related activities occur in this
portion of the project area. Possible avoidance options may include completely avoiding the
eligible portions of the sites, erecting a protective fence and/or warning signage, and/or a program
of filling and capping. In the event that avoidance/preservation is not feasible or desirable,
Horizon recommends that adverse effects to the SAL-/NRHP-eligible deposits on these two sites
that would result from development of the proposed golf course expansion would require
mitigation. Mitigation efforts likely would require some level of data recovery excavations and
analyses of archeological deposits, possibly combined with a program of public outreach and
education.

No further investigations are recommended for the remainder of the project area (i.e.,
beyond the boundaries of the NRHP-eligible archeological deposits on sites 41VV431 and
41VV432). This includes (1) the western half of site 41VV431, which contains only deflated,
surficial cultural materials that are considered to be non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the
site for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; (2) the portion of site 41VV444 that
falls within the southern portion of the project area, which appears to have been effectively
destroyed and does not contain archeological deposits that are considered eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP or for designation as SALs; and (3) the remainder of the project area, in which no
cultural resources were observed on the modern ground surface or in shovel tests.
Furthermore, it should be noted that human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are
protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or
burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery until a qualified archeologist can assess
the find, and the THC should be notified immediately.
