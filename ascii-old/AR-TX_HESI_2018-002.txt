MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by CP&Y, Inc. (CP&Y) on
behalf of the City of Woodway to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and
assessment for the proposed Fairway Gravity Sewer Project in Woodway, McLennan County,
Texas. The proposed undertaking would involve replacing approximately 4.8 kilometers
(3.0 miles) of existing wastewater trunk line that meanders between residential subdivisions on
the southern shore of Lake Waco. The proposed right-of-way (ROW) would begin on the northern
side of US Highway (US) 84 roughly between two rows of houses approximately midway between
Bryce Drive and Wooded Crest Drive. From here, the proposed ROW weaves sinuously
northward between rows of houses following the course of an unnamed tributary of the South
Bosque River. The proposed ROW would turn eastward just south of Midway Park, continuing
eastward to its terminus at an existing City of Woodway lift station located off the southwestern
side of State Highway (SH) 6. For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the project area
was considered to consist of the 4.8-kilometer- (3.0-mile-) long proposed ROW within a 30.5meter- (100.0-foot-) wide linear corridor, covering an area of 14.7 hectares (36.4 acres).
The proposed project is being sponsored by the city of Woodway, a political subdivision
of the state of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code
of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). No federal funding has been identified
for the project at this time; however, the project would require use of a federal permit issued by
the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. As such,
any portion of the overall project area that falls within the scope of the federal permit would also
fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended. As the project represents a publicly sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor is
required to provide the Texas Historical Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on
the project’s potential to adversely affect historic properties listed on or considered eligible for
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas and/or for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under the NHPA, as appropriate.
On May 30 to 31, Horizon archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Jared Wiersema,
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities

Management Summary

Permit no. 8443. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the tract and thoroughly inspected the modern
ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The proposed ROW roughly
follows the ROW of the existing sewer trunk line, though variances were observed in some areas.
Roughly the southern half of the proposed ROW (the north-to-south-oriented segment) passes
through a developed suburban area characterized by residential lots, Woodway City Hall, and the
Carleen Bright Arboretum. Segments of the existing sewer are visible on the bed of the unnamed
creek and suspended above the channels of feeder streams in many areas, and pre-cast concrete
manhole cylinders are visible eroding from the creek banks in several areas. Roughly the eastern
half of the proposed ROW (the east-to-west-oriented segment) passes adjacent to a paved hikeand-bike trail through lightly wooded, rolling grasslands located southeast of Midway Park.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) of linear
survey corridor per 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide transect. As such, a total of 48 shovel tests
would be required within the 4.8-kilometer- (3.0-mile-) long by 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide
linear project area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 66 shovel tests. The
pedestrian survey and shovel testing revealed that sediments in the project area consist of
gravelly and marly clay on the modern ground surface or underlying shallow veneers of sand and
silty clay. Bounding subsoil horizons composed of dense clay, gravelly clay, and limestone/marl
bedrock were encountered in all shovel tests at depths ranging from 10.0 to 40.0 centimeters
(3.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface. Shovel testing was capable of fully penetrating sediments
with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits, and it is Horizon’s opinion that the
pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and systematic shovel testing was adequate to
evaluate the cultural resources potential of the project area.
No cultural resources, prehistoric or historic-age, were recorded within the project area
during the survey.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable
and good-faith effort to identify historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources
were identified within the project area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to
13 TAC 26 or for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding
of “no historic properties affected,” and no further cultural resources investigations are
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both
prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that
any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work
should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be
notified immediately.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by CP&Y, Inc. (CP&Y) on
behalf of the City of Woodway to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and
assessment for the proposed Fairway Gravity Sewer Project in Woodway, McLennan County,
Texas (Figures 1 to 3). The proposed undertaking would involve replacing approximately
4.8 kilometers (3.0 miles) of existing wastewater trunk line that meanders between residential

archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. The purpose of the survey was to locate any significant
cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. The cultural
resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey of the
project area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26,
Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources
Management Reports. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit no. 8443.
Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and
cultural backgrounds, respectively, of the project area. Chapter 4.0 describes the results of
background archival research, and Chapter 5.0 discusses cultural resources survey methods.
Chapter 6.0 presents the results of the cultural resources survey, and Chapter 7.0 presents
cultural resources management recommendations for the project. Chapter 8.0 lists the
references cited in the report, and Appendix A summarizes shovel test data.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in central McLennan County, Texas. McLennan County is
located in Central Texas close to the common junction of three significant physiographic
provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the Edwards Plateau, and the Blackland Prairie (Hill 1901;
Hill and Vaughn 1900; Johnson 1931:125). The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone
situated between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low,
rolling land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from
the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is
an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms
and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are
associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between
uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer
rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in
others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone
in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers ranging in elevation from
230.0 to 400.0 meters (754.6 to 1,312.3 feet) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut
Plain forms a limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries,
resulting in landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately broad,
shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna flora,
whereas soil is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian woodlands and
forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and rockshelters, but such are neither common nor
extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but not widespread across the Lampasas Cut Plain
and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the study area is situated on uplands to the southeast of Lake Waco, an
artificial impoundment located at the confluence of the North, Middle, and South Bosque rivers.
Approximately the westernmost 3.1 kilometers (1.9 miles) of the proposed ROW follows the
course of an incised, unnamed tributary of the South Bosque River that drains northward into
Lake Waco. The easternmost 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) of the project area traverses a series of

H030-180118

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

ridge fingers that frame another unnamed tributary of the South Bosque River to the north that
drains westward into Lake Waco. The Bosque River system forms a part of the Brazos River
watershed, and the Bosque River discharges into the Brazos River on the northern side of Waco
approximately 9.7 kilometers (6.0 miles) northeast of the project area. The Brazos River, in turn,
flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging
into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of East Matagorda Bay.
Topographically, the project area traverses a series of dissected upland ridges southeast
of the South Bosque River (now Lake Waco). Elevations across the project area vary from
approximately 152.4 to 243.8 meters (500.0 to 800.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl), with the
higher elevations located toward the south and the lower elevations to the north and east.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the project area is situated on the Upper Cretaceous Lake Waco Formation
(Klw), which forms the lower part of the Eagle Ford Group and is composed of limestone and
shale (BEG 1970). Geomorphologically, the project area traverses three mapped soil units that
consist primarily of residuum weathered in situ from Cretaceous-age bedrock (Figure 4; Table 1)
(NRCS 2018). No Holocene-age alluvial soils are mapped within the project area.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably
cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily

forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by
grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to
5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
McLennan County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate
is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and fall.
Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate characterized
by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in
McLennan County. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (32.0 inches) and
temperature averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest
month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods
lasting from three to seven years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30.5 to 63.5 centimeters
(12.0 to 25.0 inches) were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to 127.0 centimeters
(45 to 50 inches) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall (Baker
1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain that fell
within an 18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9centimeter (22.0-inch) deluge that fell in less than three hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935
(Baker 1975). Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter,
frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing
upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of
the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer,
cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal
convective storms.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits
of their ecological range within the Texan province.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird. Reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat snake, eastern
hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake, copperhead, western
diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog, diamondback water snake,
Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and antelope were common during
the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are no longer native to this region
(Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The indigenous
human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle
throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North America, mobility and
settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9,200 TO 6,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (9,200 to 6,000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with ameliorating
climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the extinction of
herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods within this
stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate projectile
points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and bone
foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little
evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in
North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced
throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into
two periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These include the Early
PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points (i.e., Clovis,

H030-180118

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which is
characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6,000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6,000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation
of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in Central
Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and gathering pattern is
characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the
development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of
projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater diversity
during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6,000 to 3,000 B.C., the Middle Archaic
subperiod extends from 3,000 to 1,000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the
1,000 B.C. to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as
markers differentiating these three subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred
as well. Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic
subperiod, continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the
Late Archaic subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is
often considered to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential preservation
probably at least partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by the
appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north who
lacked the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Alonso
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near

Galveston Bay. However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernible at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased
participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy
settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished.
McLennan County was established by the Texas legislature on January 22, 1850, and
named for Neil McLennan, one of the early settlers.1 The county government was organized in
August 1850 with Waco as its county seat. The county originally included its present area as well
as the land to the northwest as far as the northern boundary of the Robertson colony; it was
reduced to its present size in 1854 when Bosque County was established. Although McLennan
County was organized too late to be included in the 1850 census, its population at that time has
been estimated at several hundred. Rapid growth was possible because, within two years of the
establishment of Waco Village, the frontier was pushed well to the northwest of the area. The
Indians who had lived there were moved to a Texas reservation in 1854 and then to Oklahoma in
1859. Aside from Waco, the earliest communities in the county were at Bosqueville and Bold
Springs (later called West). Most of the settlers who came to the county before the Civil War were
Americans of English, Scottish, and Irish descent who moved from other parts of Texas or from
the southern United States. Many of them were well-educated, well-to-do people with money to
invest in the establishment of new towns, schools, and churches.
The Baptist and Methodist churches were among the earliest to be organized in the
county. A Methodist church was built in Waco in 1850, and a Baptist church followed in 1851.
Episcopal services were held in Waco as early as 1854, but the church was not formally organized
until 1868. A Presbyterian church was organized in 1855. Few Catholics lived in McLennan
County until after the Civil War, when German and Czech immigrants moved to the area; a
Catholic church was built in Waco in 1870. Jewish ceremonies in Waco were celebrated in rented
rooms or private homes prior to the establishment of a synagogue in 1871. The 1860 census
showed the county’s free population to be 3,811; 270 of this number were slaveholders, who
owned a total of 2,395 slaves. The land near the Brazos River lent itself well to the establishment
of large cotton plantations, while the surrounding prairie land was used primarily for livestock.
The 1860 production of the county’s 379 farms included 2,300 bales of cotton, 187,800 bushels
of corn, 39,200 bushels of wheat, 46,600 cattle, and 22,000 sheep.
Richard Coke represented McLennan County at the Secession Convention in January
1861 and voted for secession; McLennan County voters accepted the ordinance later that year
by a margin of 586 to 191. Nevertheless, in spite of the overwhelming support of the county for
secession, the mayor of Waco from 1862 to 1866 was a Unionist. Approximately 1,500 men from
McLennan County served in the Confederate Army, including six generals—Jerome Bonaparte

Robertson, Felix Huston Robertson, Lawrence Sullivan Ross, William H. Parsons, Allison Nelson,
and Hiram Bronson Granbury. A company raised by Peter F. Ross served in the Sixth Texas
Regiment, and the Lone Star Guards became Company E of the Fourth Texas Infantry of Hood’s
Texas Brigade. The city of Waco was occupied by federal troops for a short time in 1868, and,
as in many instances in the South, clashes between federal soldiers and local residents led to
considerable ill-feeling. During the Reconstruction period, the district judge and the county
commissioners arrested each other, the judge citing the commissioners for contempt, and the
commissioners charging the judge with lunacy; all charges were dropped. Election returns for
1869 showed McLennan County voters choosing Edmund J. Davis for governor over Andrew J.
Hamilton by a vote of 797 to 606; however, in the Congressional election held two years later, the
Democratic candidate, Dewitt C. Giddings, carried the county by a vote of 1,520 to 1,162. Waco
lawyer Richard Coke was elected governor in 1873.
Like most areas in the South, McLennan County suffered a severe economic decline
immediately following the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1863
and 1866, the county experienced a 73% loss in property tax receipts. A little more than 38% of
the total property loss was in slaves; the rest came from declines in total farm acreage, farm value,
and livestock value, each of which fell 45% to 70% by the time of the 1870 census. Recovery
was slow because transportation was poor and the economy was so dependent on agriculture.
After the war, many former slaves remained in the area, some choosing to continue working for
former owners, some finding employment in Waco, and still others establishing communities such
as Downsville and Harrison. By 1870, the black population in the county had increased to 4,627,
slightly more than a third of the total number of residents. Over the course of the next several
decades, the number of blacks in the county increased steadily, although the number of white
immigrants was such that blacks as a percentage of the total population fell from 29% in 1880 to
16% in 1960. The McLennan County economy began to show signs of recovery by the late 1870s,
mainly as a result of northern capital, improved transportation, and the influx of European
immigrants. The completion of the Waco Suspension Bridge in 1870 provided a reliable means
of crossing the Brazos River and made Waco a major center for trade. The Waco and
Northwestern Railroad passed through Waco in 1872, laying track from Bremond to Ross and
thereby giving McLennan County access to markets through the Houston and Texas Central.
The overall population of the county rose from 13,500 in 1870 to 26,037 by 1880, and the
census reported 3,256 farms in 1880, up from 937 10 years earlier. Many of the county’s large
plantations were divided into small farms and leased to tenants in the years immediately following
the Civil War; other farms were broken up and sold for taxes. Immigrants from other states, as
well as European countries, were able to take advantage of the availability of land and start new
farms of their own. Farm acreage in the county in 1880 totaled 405,115 acres, an increase of
300% over pre-war numbers. Production in 1880 included 197,520 bushels of wheat, 515,648
bushels of corn, and 12,777 bales of cotton; among the county’s livestock were 30,000 cattle,
12,500 hogs, and 25,000 sheep. More railroads reached McLennan County in the 1880s, making
Waco a principal junction. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe completed its track between Temple
and Fort Worth in 1881; the Texas and St. Louis connected Waco with Corsicana in 1881 and
with Gatesville in 1882; also in 1882, the Missouri, Kansas and Texas laid track between Hillsboro
and Taylor, and the Texas Central connected Ross and Albany; and finally, in 1889 the San

16

Antonio and Aransas Pass laid track from Waco to Lott. The International and Great Northern
Railroad laid track between Marlin and Waco in 1902 and between Waco and Fort Worth in 1903.
An electric interurban line, which was completed between Waco and Dallas in 1913, provided
convenient and inexpensive passenger service until improved highways in the 1940s put it out of
business. With the railroads came new towns such as McGregor, Moody, Crawford, Lott,
Bellmead, Hewitt, Riesel, Battle, Leroy, and Axtell; other towns, like West, Eddy, Mart, Hallsburg,
and Elm Mott, were already in existence when the railroads built through and profited from the
increased economic opportunity; still other communities, like Perry, Mastersville, and Elk, were
bypassed by the railroads and faded as their populations were drawn to more convenient
locations. In 1890, the population of the county was 39,204; by the turn of the century it had risen
to 59,772.
Cotton was the dominant feature of McLennan County agriculture from the 1880s to the
1950s. As the cotton market recovered after Reconstruction, farmers new to the McLennan
County area began cultivating the black, waxy soil in the eastern sections and found that cotton
grew well there. By 1890, the county had several hundred thousand dollars invested in cotton
mills, cotton compresses, and cottonseed oil works; nearly every town on the railroad had at least
one cotton gin to accommodate area farmers. In 1890, farmers planted cotton on more than
73,000 acres, nearly a quarter of the county’s improved land, and produced 30,000 bales; in 1910,
the 240,000 acres planted in cotton represented half of the county’s improved acreage, and the
crop yielded 69,000 bales. The Cotton Palace held an exhibition and carnival in 1894 intended
to be an annual event. It burned in early 1895, but was reestablished in 1910; it continued until
1930, with a 21-year attendance of more than $8 million. In the first quarter of the 20th century,
many rural blacks moved to Waco, attracted by the prospect of better schools and better-paying
jobs. Most settled in black neighborhoods in east Waco. An educated black middle class began
to emerge during these years and was possibly perceived as a threat to the established white
society. Several lynchings occurred in the county between 1905 and 1919, and the increased
intolerance of blacks, as well as Catholics and Jews, permitted the emergence of a strong Ku
Klux Klan in the early 1920s. Klan activities in McLennan County peaked in 1923 with a parade
of 2,000 klansmen in Waco, but the organization soon began to lose popularity because of its
violence. During the 1910s and 1920s, when large numbers of Mexican nationals immigrated to
the United States, hundreds made their way to McLennan County in search of work. According
to the census of 1900, only 100 McLennan County residents were natives of Mexico; however,
by 1930, Mexican Americans in the county numbered more than 4,100, or 4% of the total
population. Some became tenant farmers or sharecroppers, while others became part of a
migratory labor force that helped to sustain the county’s cotton-dependent economy. Mexican
Americans made up 4% of the county’s population through the 1950s, but the percentage began
to rise in the 1960s and 1970s as more people immigrated to join family and friends already in
the area. By 1987, the number of Mexican Americans in McLennan County had risen to 18,872,
10% of the county’s population.
World War I brought Army Camp MacArthur and Rich Field to Waco in 1917, and the
resulting growth in business and population shifted the urban/rural balance of the county. For the
first time, the number of people living in cities and towns was greater than the number of people
living in the country. Waco’s population doubled in the late 1910s, and support services grew

H030-180118

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

rapidly to meet the demand of the larger population. Because many soldiers chose to live in Waco
after the war, expansion continued in the peacetime economy. Although agriculture continued to
dominate the county, industry was gaining a foothold. In addition to small manufacturers who
were already prospering in the towns, several large businesses moved into the area to take
advantage of the ready access to markets offered by Waco. The Barton Dyanshine factory, at
one time the world’s largest shoe polish manufacturer, was established in Waco in 1919 and
remained until 1927, when it was moved to St. Louis. The Borden company, which bottled and
distributed milk, and the Atlas Portland Cement Company, later a subsidiary of US Steel, opened
in Waco in 1929. The Great Depression of the 1930s, complicated by severe drought conditions
in much of the area, slowed the county’s growth considerably. Cotton prices fell from 18 cents
per pound to five cents between 1928 and 1931. Some city residents moved to the country to
find food; some rural residents moved to the city to find work. Waco’s population increased by
only 2.5% between 1930 and 1940; the county as a whole grew by only 3%. The Work Projects
Administration funded several construction projects, such as Tonkawa Park at Crawford and
University High School in Waco. Highway and bridge building projects also provided work,
although much of it was unskilled.
The United States entry into World War II brought an end to the depression and spurred
McLennan County’s industrial growth. During the course of the war, the army established the
Bluebonnet ordnance plant at McGregor and the Waco Army Airfield (later renamed James
Connally Air Force Base) at Waco. The Army Air Corps also leased the municipal airport that
Waco had started building near China Spring and turned the facility into the Blackland Army Air
Field. New companies were established in the Waco area to help the war effort, and they, along
with many existing industries and manufacturers, profited from government contracts. Between
the beginning of the war and December 1944, the federal government spent $42 million on the
construction and maintenance of facilities in McLennan County and $119 million for supply
contracts with local businesses. The industrialization that took place in the 1940s and 1950s
diversified the county’s economic interests and prompted a change in the agricultural system.
Many rural residents, most of them tenant farmers, gave up their farms and moved to the city in
search of industry jobs. Much of the agricultural emphasis was shifted from small family farms to
larger commercial establishments and from cotton to more diverse crops. Between the 1930s
and the 1960s, the number of farms fell sharply, and the average farm size rose from 89 acres to
259 acres. The number of tenant farmers, who had accounted for a sizeable portion of the farming
operations in the county since Reconstruction days, began to decline. In 1930, tenants operated
4,752 farms, more than 70% of the farms in the county; by 1950, they numbered only 1,288, or
one-third of the county’s farmers. This trend continued well into the 1980s, with less than 10% of
the county’s 1,977 farms being operated by tenants in 1987.
In the years following World War II, Waco and McLennan County experienced a
resurgence of population growth, and the transition to a peacetime economy went fairly smoothly.
In 1950, 130,194 people resided in McLennan County; 65% of that total lived in Waco. The
county, and especially Waco, experienced a serious setback in May 1953, when a tornado struck
the downtown area. Several city blocks were flattened, leaving 144 people dead and 1,097
injured. Several hundred homes, cars, and businesses were damaged or completely destroyed,
and many buildings had to be razed. The property damage amounted to $51 million. The 1960s

18

180118_arch_survey_report

Fairway Gravity Sewer Project, Woodway, McLennan County, Texas

found McLennan County facing several problems—the closure of the Connally Air Force Base in
1966 left many people out of work; integration of schools prompted “white flight” to suburban
areas such as Hewitt, Woodway, Beverly Hills, and Robinson; and the decline of the railroad led
to a corresponding decline in several small towns. The decade did bring improvements, however.
Among these were several urban renewal projects, the construction of Interstate Highway 35, the
establishment of McLennan Community College, the enlargement of Lake Waco, and the
establishment of the Texas State Technical College at Waco. A new interest in local history
prompted the reconstruction of Fort Fisher as the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum and
the renovation of the suspension bridge. In the early 1980s, 76% of the land in the county was
devoted to agriculture. Cotton, corn, oats, and wheat were the primary crops, accounting for 90%
of the 310,000 acres harvested; other crops were sorghum, hay, potatoes, tomatoes, and
watermelon. Nearly 60% of the county’s agricultural receipts came from livestock and livestock
products, the most important ones being turkeys, cattle, milk, sheep, wool, angora goats, mohair,
and hogs. Industries in the county surpassed agriculture in terms of income and number of people
employed, but the two spheres were closely interrelated. Poultry processing, manufacture of
prepared feeds, and dairy production were among the county’s important businesses. Other large
employers included professional and related services, wholesale and retail trade, finance,
insurance, and real estate. McLennan County had 170,755 residents in 1980, a 15% increase
over the 1970 population of 147,553, and the population in 1990 was 189,123.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) for information on previously recorded cultural
resources sites and historic properties in and near the project area as well as previous cultural
resources investigations conducted in the vicinity. Based on this archival research, 11 known
archeological sites are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the project area (Table 2;
Figure 5) (THC 2018). No archeological sites, cemeteries, or historic properties listed on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designated as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL)
are located within or adjacent to the project area.
No NRHP-eligible historic bridges, properties, or districts are shown within 1.6 kilometers
(1.0 mile) of the project area on TxDOT’s Historic Bridges of Texas or Historic Districts &
Properties of Texas online databases (TxDOT 2018a, 2018b).
Examination of historical aerial photographs and US Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps indicates that the project area meanders through an area that has consisted
largely of residential subdivisions since the mid-20th century (NETR 2018). In the early
20th century, development in the area was limited to scattered homesteads, as evidenced by
scattered structures on US Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps dating to 1924, 1931,
and 1949. By 1958, a small residential subdivision had grown off the western side of Estates
Drive that formed the core of subsequent development. Only a dozen or so houses, a high school,
and a church are visible on the 1958 USGS topographic map. Residential development appears
to have exploded in the 1960s. By 1970, residential developments covered the entire area
between US 84 and Lake Waco, with the exception of Midway Park along the shore of the lake.
While the majority of the current project area has not been previously surveyed for cultural
resources, two prior cultural resources surveys covered small portions of the current project area.
The earliest of these two prior cultural resources surveys was a survey associated with Lake
Waco sponsored by the USACE in 1984. The first dam was built on Lake Waco in 1930, and this
dam was replaced by a new dam in the 1960s as the city of Waco grew; however, cultural
resources management laws were not passed until later. The USACE’s 1984 survey was
prompted by a proposal to raise the lake level a third time, and the work entailed an intensive
survey along new areas that would be subject to inundation (TBH 2018). While the 1984 USACE
survey is mapped as having covered much of the current footprint of Lake Waco, this prior survey

More recently, a small cultural resources survey was conducted of a parcel located north
of the intersection of Bosque Boulevard and Estates Drive at the approximate mid-point of the
project area. This survey was conducted in 1996 for the City of Woodway, though a report of the
results of this survey is not on file on the THC’s TASA.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

On May 30 to 31, Horizon archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Jared Wiersema,
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the tract and thoroughly
inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The
proposed ROW roughly follows the ROW of the existing sewer trunk line, though variances were
observed in some areas. Roughly the southern half of the proposed ROW (the north-to-southoriented segment) passes through a developed suburban area characterized by residential lots,
Woodway City Hall, and the Carleen Bright Arboretum. Segments of the existing sewer are visible
on the bed of the unnamed creek and suspended above the channels of feeder streams in many
areas, and pre-cast concrete manhole cylinders are visible eroding from the creek banks in
several areas. Roughly the eastern half of the proposed ROW (the east-to-west-oriented
segment) passes adjacent to a paved hike-and-bike trail through lightly wooded, rolling
grasslands located southeast of Midway Park (Figures 6 to 20).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) of linear
survey corridor per 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide transect. As such, a total of 48 shovel tests
would be required within the 4.8-kilometer- (3.0-mile-) long by 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide
linear project area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 66 shovel tests
(Figures 21 to 22). The pedestrian survey and shovel testing revealed that sediments in the
project area consist of gravelly and marly clay on the modern ground surface or underlying shallow
veneers of sand and silty clay. Bounding subsoil horizons composed of dense clay, gravelly clay,
and limestone/marl bedrock were encountered in all shovel tests at depths ranging from 10.0 to
40.0 centimeters (3.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface. Shovel testing was capable of fully
penetrating sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits, and it is
Horizon’s opinion that the pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and systematic shovel
testing was adequate to evaluate the cultural resources potential of the project area.
All sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. The
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests were determined using
hand-held Garmin ForeTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices based on the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel testing was capable of fully penetrating sediments
with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits, and it is Horizon’s opinion that the

pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and systematic shovel testing was adequate to
evaluate the cultural resources potential of the project area. Specific shovel test data for all
66 shovel tests excavated during the survey are summarized in Appendix A.
During the archeological field survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation,
soils, landforms, survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a
photographic log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural
resources. Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s
marks) and non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal
scrap) were to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the
same location in which they were found. As no cultural materials were observed during the
survey, the collection policy was not brought into play.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological and historic-age sites within the project area as
defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the project area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs,
respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The four criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by three requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the four criteria for eligibility listed
above, and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As
discussed here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory
and history according to various periods of development in various times and at various places.
Thus, the significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic
development and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular
period of development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding
of prehistory. All four criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought
to bear for historic sites.

7.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

H030-180118

41

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.4

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

On May 30 to 31, Horizon archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Jared Wiersema,
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the tract and
thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. In addition, Horizon excavated a total of 66 shovel tests within the project area,
thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this length. Shovel testing
generally revealed gravelly and marly clay on the modern ground surface or underlying shallow
veneers of sand and silty clay. Bounding subsoil horizons composed of dense clay, gravelly clay,
and limestone/marl bedrock were encountered in all shovel tests at depths ranging from 10.0 to
40.0 centimeters (3.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface. Shovel testing was capable of fully
penetrating sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits, and it is
Horizon’s opinion that the pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and systematic shovel
testing was adequate to evaluate the cultural resources potential of the project area.
No cultural resources, prehistoric or historic-age, were recorded within the project area
during the survey.

7.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified within the project
area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for listing on the
NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties
affected,” and no further cultural resources investigations are recommended in connection with

the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected
under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects
are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the
project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity
of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be notified immediately.
