Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources background review and
field survey of 7.8 miles on the proposed Allee Lateral Line right-of-way in northwestern Dimmit
County, to be installed by Chesapeake Energy. The project was entirely privately funded, and the
properties across which the pipeline will cross are privately owned; therefore, no Texas
Antiquities Permit was required.
A 100-percent pedestrian survey with shovel testing as prescribed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists and the Texas Historical Commission of the Allee Lateral Line right-of-way was
conducted by four archaeologists during the period 17-20 January, 2011. During the course of our
survey we revisited previously recorded sites 41DM30 and 41DM31. Both are on opposites banks
of the Nueces River, and although the proposed Allee Lateral ROW would normally encounter
the eastern edge of both sites, Chesapeake Energy’s plan of boring approximately 50 feet below
each site and the Nueces River channel will not impact any cultural resources associated with
either site. Although five isolated artifacts were documented along the right-of-way, no previously
undocumented archaeological sites were discovered, and no cultural material of significance was
found. No diagnostic artifacts were observed along the proposed ROW, and no artifacts were
collected.
In sum, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the development of the pipeline be allowed to proceed
as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any additional, undiscovered
cultural resources are encountered during development, such finds should be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly two individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are the Project
Manager, Mr. David Black at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, and Permitting Specialist,
Mr. Ronnie Glenewinkel at Chesapeake Midstream. Both were extremely amiable and helpful
throughout the project, and their overall knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our
understanding of the project’s scope of work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologists Karl
Huebchen, Kevin Hanselka, and Josh Hamilton. All three worked hard, long hours, and each one
expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured this survey was conducted in a thorough and
professional manner.

Introduction
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd.,
requested a cultural resources background
review and field survey of 7.8 miles of the
proposed Allee Lateral Line right-of-way in
northwestern Dimmit County, to be installed by
Chesapeake Energy, and hereinafter referred to
as the Project Area (PA) (Figures 1 and 2).
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations
(TAAI) conducted a 100-percent pedestrian
survey with shovel testing every 100 meters
along the right-of-way on January 17-20, 2011.

Modern Environmental Setting
Figure 1. Location of Dimmit County and the
Climate and Vegetation
Allee Lateral project in Texas.
Dimmit county is located in south-central
Texas near its southern border with Mexico
(see Figure 1). Its current political boundary encompasses 1,307 square miles. The generally flat
to rolling terrain ranges in elevation from about 500-800 feet above mean sea level. Clayey and
loamy soils support the
growth of small
predominately mesquite
trees, and thorny scrub
brush with assorted cacti
and grassy understory.

With its semi-arid
environment, the county
is generally frost-free
from mid-February
through early December,
allowing for a 290-day
growing season. The
average annual rainfall is
about 22 inches, with
most rainfall occurring Figure 2. Allee Lateral Line project shown on USGS 7.5' Carrizo
in May and September. Springs East (1972) topographic map.
These peaks are the
1

result of thunderstorms bearing moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Pacific
Ocean much farther to the west. Dimmit County is known as part of the Winter Garden Region
for the vegetables grown there (Leffler 1996; Stevens and Arriaga 1985).
However, rainfall amounts vary significantly from year to year, and the high evapotranspiration
effects in the area effectively offset any beneficial surplus of annual rainfall. This is another
reason irrigation systems are so necessary, and commonly found in use today throughout the area.
Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently hovering above 1000F, although
humidity is generally low compared to environments closer to the Gulf Coast. Overall, the
county’s climate can be classified as subtropical steppe (Ochoa 1996; Vierra 1998).
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande are the major southeasterly trending rivers draining the
South Texas region. A subtle divide through the northeastern portion of the county causes
numerous intermittent creeks to flow north into the Nueces River, and numerous others of the
same type to drain southward into the Rio Grande. Many drainages intermittently flow into both
rivers during infrequent seasonal periods of abundant rainfall. Although there are many springs
in Dimmit County, very few are active due primarily to the dip of the substrate shales which carry
these subterranean seeps to the south and east. As a result, some of these active seeps/springs can
be found on the Mexican side of the
national border. Ancient springs that may
have existed in the area at one time have
likely succumbed to overgrazing and
irrigation pumping during modern times
(Brune 1981). During our investigation
of the project area in January 2011, we
observed water flowing in Carrizo Creek
and large pools in the Nueces River.
Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South
Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation
area as defined by Gould (1975), and the
regional flora of South Texas has been
classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending
out from northeast Mexico (Figures 3
and 4). This is the only part of Texas
where some vegetation exhibits growth
throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map
2011a). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively
recent occurrence, with a mix of woody
Figure 3. Physiographic regions of Texas
and grassland species providing a

2

savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester
1980; Inglis 1964). The original
vegetation was an open grassland mixed
with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and
ash were common along perennial
streams. Due in part to overgrazing and
the exclusion of fire, the invasion of
woody species has changed the
vegetation into “Texas brush country”
dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny
hackberry, brazil, whitebrush, lotebrush,
and others (Diamond et al. 1987:203221). On sandy soils, the brush includes
mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast,
clay soils support mesquite (Proposis
juliflora), various species of Acacia, and
mimosa, granjeno or desert hackberry
(Celtis pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera Figure 4. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.
angustifolia), cenizo (Leucophyllum
texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana), prickly pear (Opuntia lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia
leptocaulis), and species of Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits some of the greatest mammalian species diversity
in the state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several species of turtles,
salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50 species of fish
have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years
ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
3

It is unlikely that the climate has
changed significantly in the past
few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce
vegetation changes. The greater
changes have been induced by
human intervention through the
clearing of wooded areas along
the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping
more water for irrigation which
has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock.
Although there are still many
seeps, springs, and streams in the
area, they most probably flowed
with greater abundance during
wetter intervals than exist at the
present time, providing an
abundant resource for prehistoric
occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Allee Lateral project lies
within the South Texas
Archaeological region as defined
by Hester (1980, 1995, 2004;
Figure 5). Refining a cultural
chronology for south Texas is
problematic, due to the
compressed nature of the
archaeological record and the
scarcity of stratified sites
excavated within the region.
Hester (1995:433) acknowledges
the paucity of information that
exists for south Texas and as
such offers only a “general
framework” for prehistoric
periods particular to the region
(Figure 5). All dates are given as Figure 5. South Texas Archaeological region cultural
approximate years before chronology.

present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1999). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovistype points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no camp
sites or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as deer, fish,
and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock
cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups
were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including most
of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low during
5

the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization of a
wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as
well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the
South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at
least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P, Some
researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while
others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Subsistence
is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence
base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries indicates that Late
Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “pre-ceramic” until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during
the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented by
diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this marked a transition
period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and a
6

reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter
1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites
were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted.
Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and the
manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
7

Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

Dimmit County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in Dimmit County indicate that the area has been occupied for about 11,000
years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land hospitable.
Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed rabbitskin robes,
8

and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly increased the deadliness
of their spears (Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they learned to make pottery
and to hunt with bows and arrows. “During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the
Coahuiltecan Indians native to Dimmit County were squeezed out by other Indian who were
migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from the south. Many of the
Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and Comanches moved in
to take their place” (Leffler 1996).
“No permanent Spanish settlement seems to have been established in the future Dimmit County.
Beginning in the late 1600s, however, Spaniards passed through the area on the Old San Antonio
Road, a camino real, to and from other Spanish settlements in Texas. After the Mexican War of
Independence the Mexican government used land grants to encourage its citizens to settle in
Texas. Perhaps as many as seven grants were made between 1832 and 1834 that included territory
now in Dimmit County. None of the recipients seems to have made use of the land, however. By
1836, when Texas became independent from Mexico, the area remained populated almost solely
by Indians” (Leffler 1996).
Between the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War (1836–46), most of Dimmit County lay in
the disputed area between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River, and it became a haven for
desperate characters until about 1865. Carrizo Springs was founded in 1865, with the new settlers
who lived in jacals or dugouts frequently being harrassed by hostile Indians and outlaws. Due in
part tobeing pursued by the Texas Rangers, and being decimated by disease, the Indians were
forced to leave Dimmit County by 1877, and in 1880 Carrizo Springs became the county seat for
the newly formed county. By 1880, cattle ranching was firmly established, and although sheep
ranching was also an important part of the economy at the time, by 1900 extended droughts and
an increase in predators combined to make sheep ranching a tough and dwindling business
(Leffler 1996).
Although the residents of Dimmit County learned to cope with the sparse annual rainfall, artesian
wells ushered in an era of large vegetable truck farms in the 1890s, and Dimmit County became
known as part of the Texas Winter Garden Region, one of the most prolific vegetable-growing
areas in the country.
As with rest of the nation, the Great Depression many of the county’s farmers were forced to cut
back their once-lucrative vegetable production during the depression, and fell back on raising
poultry, hogs, and dairy cattle (Leffler 1996). The discovery of large oil and gas fields in the
county in the 1950s certainly bolstered Dimmit County’s economy, and although large ranches
lay claim to most of the land in the county, the production of oil and gas are very much a
progressively increasing part of the county’s development (Leffler 1996).

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review
The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the immediate
area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.

Archaeological Surveys and Sites within One Mile of the Project Area
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archeological sites indicates that
there have been three professional cultural resources surveys conducted within one mile (1,609
meters) of the Allee Lateral Line. The first was conducted in 2004 along the Highway 85 corridor
by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. The second was conducted by PBS&J in 2010 along a pipeline
right-of-way for Anadarko Petroleum (Atlas 2011). Other informal surveys were conducted in the
1960s by the Carrizo Springs High School Archeology Club. Finally, Tierras Antiguas conducted
a cultural resources survey of the Circle T 1H Pipeline in January 2011. As a result, there are
seven recorded archaeological sites within one mile of the Allee Lateral proposed rights-of-way
(Table 1).

Prehistoric Site Potential
A review of the Texas Archeological Site Database (ATLAS) indicated that even though only a
handful of scattered archaeological surveys had been conducted in Dimmit County, these very few
surveys identified over 165 archaeological sites. Archaeological remains such as Clovis, Folsom,
and Plainview artifacts found in Dimmit County indicated that the area was likely occupied by
Native Americans as early as 11,000 years ago.
Without written or oral accounts before the 1700s, it is difficult or impossible to truly say what
bands or tribes were within the modern political boundaries of Dimmit county before then. Only
cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and apparent
lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. Archaeologists
have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites, including large open campsites
that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces with numerous campfires, where
a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered animal remains are
found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or on higher terrain where more
ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can expect stone chipping stations,
or prehistoric quarries.

Historic Site Potential
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the Dimmit
County area, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer de Vaca traversed parts
of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the huntergatherers of Texas and northern Mexico. His account of his experiences in 1533–34 indicates that
groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves to the easily exploitable riverine
environments in the fall, winter, and summer, occasionally sending a hunting party onto the
grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near each other in the semiarid
environs of south Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other succulents (Campbell and
Campbell 1981:13–37).
By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico with
thousands of cattle, and using Native Americans as slave labor. This encroachment by the Spanish
forced groups from northern Mexico to flee into south Texas. In the 1700s and 1800s, there are
documented accounts of Spanish entradas passing through the area, but none have been noted to
establish any sort of permanent structures in the area (Chipman 1992).
It was not until about 1865 that Dimmit County and the surrounding frontier hinterlands were
considered safe enough for white settlers to begin establishing smaller ranches and farmlands
without complete annihilation by the many roving bands of angry Comanche raiders from the
north, as well as other displaced Native American groups (Leffler and Long 2010; Leffler 2010).
Because of the relatively low habitation in generally rural areas that the two pipelines pass
through, little or no attention was given to early aerial photography. In lieu of this, the oldest
topographic maps found of the area were those produced in 1939 by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers for Carrizo Springs and Big wells (Map 2011b, c). Although the maps are not exact
by today’s standards, it is possible that historic water tanks, corrals, outbuildings other structures
related to early ranching activities could be encountered along both lines. For example, five
structures are shown on the 1939 Carrizo Springs topographic map in close proximity to the
extreme western end of the Allee lateral.
A map found in the Texas General Land Office (Texas GLO 2011)indicates that the Allee Lateral
crosses the Nueces River near the Upper Presidio Road Crossing, near present-day Presidio Park
(Figure 6). The Upper Presidio Road was used from about 1800-1870 as a well-traveled route
from Mexico (McGraw 2011). Although there were no documented historical archaeological sites
directly associated with the Upper Presidio Road along the Allee Lateral, the possibility of
undiscovered sites did exist.
In sum, preliminary research indicated that there could be rare and isolated occurrences of early
ranching activities along the Allee Lateral, but the expectations of encountering any
archaeological site of significance from the 1500s through the mid-1900s along the line were
minimal. Technically, any structures older than 45 years are now considered of interest by the
Texas Historical Commission, and this would be considered.

Soils Maps
A review of county soils maps and publications both online and in hard copy format indicated that
there were 11 different soil types to be encountered along the Allee Lateral (Figures 7-9; Table
2). These are of varying depths, with different sedimentation, deposition, and erosional rates
(Stevens and Arriaga 1985; Web Soil Survey 2011). However, terrace deposits in close proximity
to streams offered the highest potential for buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist. In
this case, there appeared to be a moderate to high potential for such deposits to still be extant
within terrace deposits in the southwestern portion of the project area along the upper reaches of
Carrizo Creek, and in the northeastern portion of the project area along the Nueces River.
Otherwise, the Allee Lateral was to traverse through eroded terrain and soils where there very well
could be dispersed archaeological sites, but because of their surficial palimpsest conditions it was
very unlikely that any of these would possess vertical and horizontal integrity, and therefore offer
minimal research potential beyond their positioning on the landscape.

Field Survey Goals and Methodology
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Four archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the 7.8-mile right-of-way
(ROW), meandering back and forth across the 100-foot wide corridor. Surface visibility ranged
from 50 to 100 percent, and all cutbanks, and rodent and mammal backdirt piles were thoroughly
examined. Including those areas that were intended to be deeply bored under, Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) conducted a 100-percent pedestrian survey with shovel
testing every 100 meters along the right-of-way, with closer interval shovel tests dug in close
proximity to stream crossings. A total of 133 shovel tests along the right-of-way, as well as two
on site 41DM30 (Figures 10-21, 27).
Shovel tests were dug in 20-cm levels, and all sediments were screened through 1/4-inch wire
mesh. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not
to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. The results
of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, are on file at the Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations office in Martindale, Texas, and may be made available upon
request.
16

No new sites were discovered, but the lone site revisited (41DM30) was mapped using a paceand-compass method, as well as a hand-held GPS. Field notes were made about the site and a
sketch map was drawn. Artifacts were described, and an outline sketch drawn of each. In
accordance with a general “no collection” policy, the artifacts recovered from all shovel tests were
then returned to the upper 10 cm of the individual tests.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
During the survey it became readily apparent that approximately 80 percent of the project’s
surface area was either disturbed or deflated by natural processes. Sparse vegetation throughout
the 7.8 miles consisted of small mesquite trees, shrubs, mesquite brush, and native grasses. An
exception was along Carrizo Creek and the Nueces River where riverine shade trees and dense
understory was observed. In some areas, the pipeline ROW was disturbed due to apparent
vegetation clearing, and ranch road construction. No previously undocumented archaeological
sites were discovered, but prehistoric site 41DM30 was revisited. Although prehistoric site
41DM31 was mapped as being in the pipeline right-of-way, no evidence of cultural material was
observed in that area. In addition, five remotely dispersed isolated finds were documented along
the right-of-way.

Prehistoric Discoveries
41DM30
Description
When this site was documented in the
1964 by members of the Carrizo Springs
High School Archaeology Club (Atlas
2010), they described it as having flint
and burned rock scattered over the
surface covering perhaps three to four
acres, and maybe three to four feet deep
in some areas. Artifacts observed at that
time included a Perdiz arrow point, a
side-notched dart point, large quantities
of flint flakes, snails, mussel shells, and
some burned rock.
When revisited by Tierras Antiguas 47
years later in January 2011, we observed Figure 22. Shovel testing and recording artifacts at
that the portion of the site within the 41DM30; facing north.
Allee Lateral right-of-way (see Figure 10) was situated on the edge of a steep bluff overlooking
the original channel of the Nueces River. The surface was heavily eroded, and deep gullies were
incised perpendicular to the channel (Figures 22 and 23). As such, surface visibility in January
2011 ranged from 95-100 percent across the site.

Although a niche pool existed in the
bottom of the Nueces River channel
directly below 41DM30, the relict
channel was otherwise dry in January
2011 (Figures 24 and 25), and Figure 26
shows the 8-meter cutbank under
41DM30.
Elevation at the site ranges from 548-552
feet amsl. Soils on the site consist of
Winterhaven silty clay loam, commonly
found on gently undulating uplands in
Dimmit County (Stevens and Arriaga
1985; Web Soil Survey 2011).

Levels of Effort and Results
A surface inspection revealed that the
cultural material was spread across an
area of approximately 30 meters (n-s) x
20 meters (e-w) of the pipeline right-ofway. Numerous push piles were
observed, indicating that the immediate
area had at one time been cleared of
vegetation, and was heavily disturbed.
Surface artifacts observed included four
chert biface fragments, one quartzite
hammerstone, and about two dozen
chert interior and exterior flakes. No
cultural material was observed in either
of the two shovel tests placed on the site
(Figure 27; Table 3).

Summary
The portion of 41DM30 that will be bored under by Chesapeake Energy (see Figure 19) is a very
heavily eroded and disturbed open campsite area consisting of debitage, mussel shells, firecracked rocks, and snails. As such its scientific value in the immediate area is minimal, except
for its positioning on the landscape. Therefore, Tierras Antiguas assesses this portion of the site
as insignificant, and recommends that the pipeline route should be allowed to be constructed as

22

planned. In this case, it becomes a moot point because construction plans call for boring
approximately 50 feet below the site, and the site will not be disturbed.

41DM31
In 1964, 41DM31 was described by members of the Carrizo Springs High School Archaeology
Club as a prehistoric open campsite with burned rocks, and lithic debitage scattered over 4-5 acres. At
that time it was noted that the site was heavily eroded, with no depth. Diagnostics observed included a
Perdiz point and a Frio point. The location of 41DM31 was mapped as directly across the old

Nueces Channel from 41DM30 (Atlas
2011).
In January, 2011 when Tierras Antiguas
archaeologists examined the surface of
the portion of 41DM31 that will be bored
under in order to construct the Allee
Lateral (see Figure 19), they encountered
very rugged, steep, heavily eroded, and
gullied terrain (Figure 28). Although
snail and mussel shell fragments were
visible on several eroded cutbanks, no
definitive cultural material was observed.
As such, our assessment of this portion of
41DM31 that is to be bored under is of
little scientific value, and thus considered Figure 28. Eroded terrain of 41DM31; facing
as non-significant.
west.

Prehistoric Isolated Finds (IFs)
A total of five artifacts were found widely scattered along the Allee Lateral right-of-way, with no
apparent association with other cultural material. As such, they were documented with a sketched
outline and field notes before recording their locations with a hand-held GPS. UTM coordinates
for each of these are available upon request from Tierras Antiguas.
Isolated Find 1 is a bifacial manufacturing interior flake, 2 cm in length, found 45 cmbs in
Shovel Test 16 (see Figure 19). It was chipped from fine-grained, brown, non-heat treated chert.
It is located in an upland area that had been disturbed by vegetation clearing, and is considered
as a non-significant discovery.
Isolated Find 2 is the distal tip of a biface found in a two-track road on a deflated upland surface
between Shovel Tests 84 and 85 (see Figure 13). It was manufactured from gray, non-heated
treated, fine-grained chert. Although it was broken post-depositionally, it exhibited evidence of

23

late stage reduction, and was likely used a knife before it was either lost or discarded. Although
interesting, given its context, it is also considered as a non-significant discovery.
Isolated Find 3 is the medial fragment of a
middle-to-late stage biface that has been heavily
damaged post-depositionally. It is made from
gray, fine-grained, non-heat treated chert. As
shown in Figure 29, it was found on an eroded
surface relatively void of vegetation, in this case
just west of Soldier Slough (aka Turkey Creek)
near Shovel Test 77 (see Figure 15). It is also
considered as a non-significant discovery.
Isolated Find 4 is core reduction flake with
approximately 50 percent cortex remaining on its
dorsal surface. The parent material is gray, non- Figure 29. Isolated Find 3.
heat treated, fine-grained chert. It was
discovered on a heavily eroded and deflated sloping ridge surface near Shovel Test 24 (see Figure
19). Given its context and its redundancy in cultural material, it is considered as a non-significant
discovery.
Isolated Find 5 is an interior, middle-stage biface manufacturing flake made from fine-grained,
tan chert that does not appear to have been subjected to heat treatment. It was found on a deflated
and eroded surface on a low upland extended ridge east of Carrizo Creek immediatly adjacent to
Shovel Test 108 (see Figure 11). As with IF 4, given the context and redundancy in cultural
material, IF 5 is also considered as a non-significant discovery.

Historic Discoveries
Other than modern trash, no historic
cultural material was observed along the
entire length of the Allee Lateral, either
on the surface or in any of the 135
shovel tests. However, as discussed
above, one aspect of this project
included the possibility that the Allee
Lateral would cross or otherwise
intersect the Spanish Camino Real
known as the Upper Presidio Road, used
from about 1800 through about 1870.
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists were
attuned to the possible presence of
ceramics, metal artifacts, and any other Figure 30. Old roadcut into lower terrace of the
items that could be attributed to this time modern-day Nueces River channel off the southeast
edge of Presidio Park; facing east.

period as they inspected the surface and
cutbanks along the old, relict channel of
the Nueces river, as well as the modernday channel directly on the east edge of
the old Presidio Crossing (see Figure 6),
and an area that is now designated as
Presidio Park.
No evidence of cultural material that
could be construed to be of Spanish
Colonial age was found either within, or
adjacent to the proposed Allee Lateral
right-of-way corridor. In addition, from
modern-day Presidio park eastward,
severe erosion, and a shifting river Figure 31. Old roadcut into lower terrace of the
channel has apparently obscured any modern-day Nueces River channel off the

through the area - with possibly one exception.
While examining the western edge of the modern-day Nueces channel, archaeologists observed
an apparent old roadcut leading from Presidio Park into the bottom of the channel (Figures 30 and
31). Although the age of this artificial cut into the bank cannot be determined, we surmise that
it could have been the route of the Upper Presidio Road coming from the west, into the Nueces
River bottom crossing. The UTM coordinates for this roadcut are E424602 N3163938 (NAD 83).
It is situated approximately 70 meters north of the Allee Lateral, and as shown in Figure 19, the
entire area will be bored under and not affected by installation of the Allee Lateral.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100-percent pedestrian survey with shovel testing every 100 meters along the Allee Lateral was
conducted by four archaeologists during the period 17-20 January, 2011. Archaeologists found
no previously undocumented archaeological sites, but did revisit prehistoric sites 41DM30 and
41DM31, both sites recorded some 47 years earlier. In addition, five isolated prehistoric artifacts
were found, and they were sufficiently documented. Historic discoveries included no cultural
material, but an old road cut into a lower terrace of the Nueces River could possibly represent a
route into and out of the Nueces River bottom used by travelers along the Upper Presidio Road
from ca. 1800-1870.
In sum, no significant cultural resources will be impacted by the construction of the Allee Lateral,
and as such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the development of the pipeline be allowed to
proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any additional,
undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development, such finds should be
examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
