Abstract
This report presents an evaluation of high-resolution geophysical survey data collected within a portion of
Block 439, Brazos Area. The survey area is located within state waters just north of the Texas State
Seaward Boundary (3 league line) within Offshore Matagorda County. The survey was conducted for
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Fugro GeoServices, Inc. acquired the high quality geophysical
data aboard the Miss Emma McCall on December 3 and 4, 2013. Work was completed under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 6697. The cultural resources remote-sensing survey encompassed over 219 acres
of water bottom and involved approximately 132,872.00 linear feet (25.2 linear miles) of survey.
Findings submitted in this report are based on the interpretation of side scan sonar, magnetometer,
subbottom profiler, and bathymetry data sets. The data have been assessed for evidence of shipwrecks
and high probability areas for prehistoric archaeological sites associated with formerly subaerially
exposed landforms.
The results of the high-resolution geophysical survey included the identification of three (3) unidentified
magnetic anomalies ranging from 9-gammas to 75-gammas in amplitude and 191-feet to 245-feet in
duration.
Unidentified Magnetic Anomaly No. 1 (9 gammas / 191 feet) and No. 2 (16 gammas / 207 feet) exhibit low
amplitude and relatively short duration. These anomalies do not exhibit characteristic features usually
associated with shipwreck locations. It is highly unlikely these anomalies represent possible shipwreck
remains. These two (2) unidentified magnetic anomalies are interpreted as probable modern debris.
Unidentified Magnetic Anomaly No. 3 exhibited an amplitude of 75 gammas with a duration of 245 feet.
This dipole anomaly also exhibited a north over south orientation. Studies conducted by Pearson (1990)
and Gearhart (2004) concluded that magnetic anomalies representing shipwreck remains exhibited
certain characteristics. These characteristics include an amplitude greater than 50 gammas, a duration of
80 feet or more, dipole or complex in nature, and a north over south orientation. Unidentified Magnetic
Anomaly No. 3 possess all of these characteristics and therefore is interpreted as possibly representing
shipwreck remains. This anomaly should be avoided by 100 meters. This avoidance criteria has been
plotted on the Archaeological, Bathymetry, and Hazard Map and the Magnetic Contour Map.
No side scan sonar contacts were noted within the survey area.
There were no other unusual depressions, scours, sediment changes, unidentified magnetic anomalies or
unidentified seafloor targets observed within the survey area that could represent unidentified shipwreck
remains. There were also no landforms identified within the survey area that could be considered as high
probability areas for prehistoric occupations.

Introduction

This report presents an evaluation of high-resolution geophysical survey data collected within a portion of
Block 439, Brazos Area (BA). The survey area is located within state waters just north of the Texas State
Seaward Boundary (3 league line). The data have been assessed for evidence of high probability areas
for prehistoric occupations and shipwrecks.
This study was conducted for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) to meet requirements
under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Section 106 requires federally
funded or permitted projects to give consideration to historic and prehistoric cultural resources. A review
of the Council of Texas Archaeologistsâ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management (CRM)
Reports indicates that contents for a Full Report must meet all minimum requirements stipulated for a
Short Report, which includes the following: Definition of Study Area, Management Summary, Research
Design, Results, and Recommendations. The Full Report must also include the following sections:

II. Environmental Background
Soils and Geology
The Gulf of Mexico originated in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic with rifting and was marked by crustal
attenuation and sea-floor spreading due to the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea (Weimer et al.,
1998). The basement terrain of the eventual site of the Gulf of Mexico was a suture zone representing an
area of crustal weakness that provided the optimum conditions necessary to lead to the separation of the
supercontinent Pangea and the subsequent formation of the Gulf of Mexico basin (Snelson and Worrall,
1989). Rifting continued during the Middle Jurassic, south of the first episode area, in what is now
referred to as the deep Gulf of Mexico. This rifting event is associated with the deposition of a massive
salt unit known as the Louann Formation (Jamieson, 1996). Aeolian sand deposition on top of a regional
unconformity also characterized the Gulf of Mexico during the Middle Jurassic, while the Late Jurassic
was a time of oceanic spreading spanning ten million years. Carbonates were deposited on top of
continental crust in the northern portion of the Gulf of Mexico from the Middle Jurassic to Cretaceous at
the same time as massive subsidence was occurring in the deep Gulf. This subsidence created a basin
about 3,300 feet deep in which deep-water shales and marls were deposited (Weimer et al., 1998). The
shelf-margin of the Gulf of Mexico during the Cretaceous was marked by two reef-building episodes,
occurring during the Early and Middle Cretaceous periods. The Late Cretaceous period was a time of
massive sedimentation when clastics were deposited in the Gulf of Mexico basin. The Laramide orogeny
occurred during the Tertiary Period, which caused deformation and volcanism to occur in the Gulf of
Mexico region (Snelson and Worrall, 1989). Clastic deposition, as well as massive progradation over the
Jurassic salt, made mobile by the overburden of the sediments, characterized the Cenozoic evolution of
the Gulf Coast (Jamieson, 1996).
The study area is located in an area known as the Texas-Louisiana Shelf. Cenozoic history of this area
was dependent on three major factors: regional subsidence, sea-level changes, and sediment supply.
Generally, the northwestern Gulf of Mexico shelf region exhibits a gulfward shift of progressively younger
sandstone/shale depocenters while the shelf edge became progressively younger basinward as well
(diagram 1). Rates of shelf-edge progradation throughout Cenozoic time fluctuated due to sediment
supply, which was dependent upon tectonic events occurring in the western United States and Mexico.
Report No. 2413-1070

Three distinct events of massive sediment influx into broad structural sags, or embayments, occurred in
the Gulf of Mexico basin during the Cenozoic (diagram 2). During the Paleocene and Eocene, sediment
influx due to orogeny of the Rocky Mountains therefore resulting in massive shelf progradation
concentrated in the Galveston/High Island into what is known as the Houston Embayment. The shelf
edge during the Oligocene exhibited massive progradation in the Matagorda/Brazos area due to large
volumes of sediment influx as a result of the Sierra Madre Occidental volcanism. This area is known as
the Rio Grande Embayment. The Mississippi Embayment, beginning in the Miocene and continuing
today is the result of massive sediment influx and progradation of the shelf due to reactivation of the
southern Rockies, Colorado Plateau and Appalachian uplifts (Galloway et al. 1991).

Seafloor or subbottom sediment cores were not obtained in conjunction with the 2013 survey. Seafloor
sediments across the area are reported to consist of silty-clay (Minerals Management Service, Visual No.
3, 1983).
John E. Chance and Associates performed an Archaeological, Engineering, and Hazard Study within the
Brazos Area in 1981. Twenty-seven (27) sediment cores were obtained along a proposed pipeline route
corridor. Three (3) of the twenty-seven (27) sediment cores were taken within Block 439, Brazos Area.
These three (3) cores confirm that sediments within the study area consist of silty-clays.

III. Cultural Background
Prehistoric Cultural Resources Evaluation
The initial emergence, and subsequent settlement of prehistoric hunters and gatherers into the new world
has long been a controversial issue within the archaeological community. It is generally accepted that the
first human inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere came from northeast Asia during the last glacial
period via the Bering Land Bridge, which connected Alaska and Siberia during various glacial periods.
Once across, these small bands of hunters and gatherers, following herds of megafauna such as
mammoths, mastodons, ancient bison, and caribou, migrated from Alaska southward through Canada in
an âice-free corridorâ located between the two parts of the Canadian ice sheet, the Laurentide to the east
and the Cordilleran to the west. The exact date of when this southward migration took place is a source of
debate among current archaeological researchers. Some researchers contend the first wave of
inhabitants in the new world migrated southward during the Wisconsin glaciation, sometime prior to
25,000 B.C., however there is virtually no definitive empirical evidence in the archaeological record to
support such claims.
The vast majority of American archaeologists adhere to a more conservative estimate of a southward
migration of people sometime at the end of the Late Wisconsin Age (13,000 B.C. - 10,000 B.C.). Securely

dated and widely accepted human settlements, such as the Lehner and Murray Springs sites in Arizona,
that possess a mean age from 21 samples of 11,000Â±200 years seem to support a definite migration of
New World inhabitants at least by the end of the Late Wisconsin Age (Bense 1994). In any event, by
approximately 10,000 B.C., these new inhabitants had settled most of the geographical area south of the
ice sheets, up to and including the tip of South America.
Paleo-Indian sites such as Avery Island, Louisiana and Wascissa River and Little Salt Spring, Florida
indicate that human occupation of the gulf coast of North America had occurred by 12,000 years B.P.
However, it was not until the following Archaic Period (8,000 â 1,000 B.C.) that native populations began
to actively occupy terrestrial landforms that are now submerged along the gulf coast. A vibrocoring project
conducted by Coastal Environments, Inc. (1986) within the relict Sabine River System located offshore
Texas resulted in the recovery of Rangia cuneata shell deposits and quantities of burned and unburned
bone material from relict river terraces buried 5-6 meters and 16-18 meters below the seafloor. These
materials were radiocarbon dated to 8,055 +90 years B.P. Preservation of prehistoric cultural resource
materials within marine sites is particularly vulnerable to high-energy environments associated with wave
attack during initial sea level transgressions. Archaeological artifacts that have been covered by finegrained sediments within low-energy depositional environments, such as floodplains, river terraces, point
bars, bays, lagoons, ponds, subsiding deltas, and sinkholes, prior to marine transgression will be afforded
the best opportunity for preservation (Stright, 1986). The identification of such landforms in presently
submerged areas would represent high probability areas for prehistoric archaeological sites.

Historic Cultural Resources Evaluation
The regional probability for shipwrecks in this area is considered to be moderate; preservation of a wreck
would be moderate to good (Pearson et al. 2003). Analyses of available shipwreck sources, as well as
the FUGRO CHANCE database, indicate that no shipwrecks have been reported within the current
survey area. The information for the nearest reported shipwrecks are listed below:

It is important to note that although there are many sources of information for reported shipwreck
locations in the Gulf of Mexico Region (i.e.: Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System
(AWOIS), Hangs and Obstructions (HO), Coastal Environments Inc. baseline study, etc.), many of these
lists are primarily based on secondary sources of information, shipwreck location coordinates are often
inaccurate, and many only contain information concerning large, twentieth century commercial craft. It is
therefore possible for earlier commercial craft and/or private vessels to be located within the survey area.
The degree to which a shipwreck is preserved is dependant upon the interaction of multiple factors. Hull
composition, sediment type, water depth, wave energy, depth of burial, and biological activity all play a
vital role in determining how much of the original vessel and its associated cargo is preserved once on
bottom.
Studies conducted by Garrison et al. (1989a), Muckelroy (1998), and others suggest that shipwrecks
which are located in low energy environments with fine grained seafloor sediments have the highest
probability for preservation. Conversely, shipwrecks located in high energy, dynamic environments with
courser grained seafloor sediments have the lowest probability for preservation. Based on this model, the
areas within the Gulf of Mexico region that would afford the highest probability for shipwreck preservation
would include the continental shelf region in the northwestern portion of the Gulf, specifically the area
west of the Mississippi River delta. The area of the Gulf where shipwreck preservation would be
considered to be low would include the majority of the Gulf of Mexico region east of the Mississippi River
delta. While this model is generally applicable to most parts of the continental shelf region of the Gulf of
Mexico, exceptions would include coastal areas such as bays and lagoons where protection from full
exposure to wave energy would be anticipated.
Hull composition is also an important factor in determining how much of a vessel will be preserved.
Wooden hulled vessels are subject to biological degradation, such as toredo worms, and destruction of
exposed vessel sections by wave action, currents, and storms. While metal hulled vessels largely remain
intact, corrosion and encrustation can have detrimental affects to the structural integrity of the shipâs hull
and superstructure.
Identification and interpretation of shipwreck remains based on high-resolution geophysical data is a
complex and highly variable process. Attempts to differentiate between modern ferromagnetic debris and
shipwrecks have been conducted by numerous marine archaeologists such as Arnold (1982), Saltus
(1986), Gearhart (1988), and others, with variable degrees of success. An analysis and compilation of
these studies by Garrison et al. (1989b) resulted in the outlining of several salient criteria in differentiating
between the two types of anomalies. The study found that magnetic anomalies indicative of shipwreck
sites include as follows: multiple peak anomalies, anomalies with spatial frequency, differential amplitude
anomalies, anomalies spread over a 10,000 m2 area or greater, anomalies with long durations, and
anomalies with axial or linear configurations. Individually, these anomaly types may not be indicative of
high probabilities for the existence of a shipwreck within a given area. However, the probability for the
presence of a shipwreck should be considered high where these types of anomalies co-occur.
The side scan sonar, when used in conjunction with the magnetometer, can also aid in the identification
of shipwreck remains. Seafloor depressions, scours, and geometrically complex contacts are common
sonar contacts associated with known shipwreck sites throughout the Gulf of Mexico region. In areas
where hard seafloor bottoms exist, wreck debris may be visually identifiable resting on the seafloor.
Bathymetric and subbottom profiler systems may also prove useful in the identification of shipwreck
remains within a survey area. In those instances where a survey trackline passes directly over a buried
shipwreck, a diffraction anomaly, much like those observed over pipelines, may be visible. Where
multibeam bathymetric systems are used, shipwrecks partially or fully exposed may appear as
topographic anomalies rising above the surrounding ambient seafloor.

IV. Previous Investigations
A review of the FGSI, FUGRO Chance, and John E. Chance & Associates, Inc. file inventory, indicate
one (1) previous remote sensing survey performed within Block 439, Brazos Area.
Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corporation of Houston, Texas contracted John E. Chance & Associates,
Inc. to perform an Archaeological, Engineering, and Hazard Study for a proposed 36-inch pipeline from
Block 538-L to 504-S, Brazos Area, offshore Texas. The survey fieldwork was conducted from August 13
to 19, 1981. Twenty-seven soil cores were also acquired along the proposed pipeline route. Robert J.
Floyd, Marine Archaeologist, authored the 1981 Archaeological Assessment. The survey coverage for
the 1981 proposed pipeline is located northeast of the proposed reef site location.
Geophysical systems utilized during the study included a proton magnetometer, side scan sonar, and
sub-bottom profiler units (boomer and pinger). Vessel positioning during the survey was accomplished by
a Cubic Western DM-54 Automatic Range Grid Overlay (ARGO). Range error of the ARGO system was
Â±3 meters. The subbottom system included an ORE Model 140 Transceiver (1-12 kHz) pinger. The
boomer system consisted of an EPC 4100 recorder, EGG transducer driver, boomer plate transducer,
Krohn Hite 3500 filter, and a ten element hydrophone streamer manufactured by Hydrosurveys. The
sonar system utilized was an EG&G Model SMS 960 Seafloor Mapping System. A Geometrics Marine
Magnetometer Model 801/03 was utilized to detect anomalies in the magnetic field within the survey area.
A modified Kullenburg piston corer was used to collect soil samples along the proposed pipeline route.
During the 1981 geophysical survey, two (2) side scan sonar contacts were noted within Block 407,
Brazos Area. The first sonar contact measured 50 feet in length, 25 feet in width, with a height of 2 feet
above the seafloor. A 14-gamma magnetic anomaly was associated with this contact. This contact was
interpreted as a framework structure or pipe joints associated with previous construction activities. The
second sonar contact measured 25 feet in length, 10 feet in width, with no height above the surrounding
seafloor. A 12-gamma magnetic anomaly was associated with this contact. This contact was very faint
and the exact nature of the object could not be determined. Three (3) additional magnetic anomalies
were noted within the survey area. These anomalies ranged in amplitude from 10 to 14 gammas. No
anomalous seafloor features were noted within close proximity to these magnetic anomalies. These
magnetic anomalies were noted within Blocks 407, 439, and 510. The magnetic anomaly noted with
BA439 exhibited an amplitude of 10 gammas and was noted almost directly on the existing (now
removed) Transco 30-inch pipeline. The location of this magnetic anomaly falls outside coverage
provided by the current/2013 survey.
The sub-bottom profiles and core samples acquired along the centerline indicate that the overconsolidated, oxidized top soils of the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation would be impacted by pipeline
construction over the northern extent of the proposed route. Evidence of oxidized clay was noted within
two feet of the mudline from Block 439, just inside the 3 League Line, northward to the termination of the
survey in Block 504-S. Sonar records highlighted an area of increased bottom density within Blocks 504,
505, 510, and 511, Brazos Area. Core No. 1, taken within the increased bottom density zone within Block
505, consisted of 12 inches of highly oxidized clays. This soil sample suggests that the entire zone of
dense material noted on sonar records represents an outcropping of the Pleistocene top soils. These
soils were exposed to thousands of years of subaerial weathering during the Late Wisconsin glaciation
and low sea-level stage. Several river channels were noted on sub-bottom profiles in this area. These
rivers were cut during the Late Wisconsin period and gradually infilled as sea-level rose during the
Holocene transgression.
No side scan sonar contacts were noted within BA439 during the 1981 Archaeological, Engineering, and
Hazard Study. One (1) 10-gamma unidentified magnetic anomaly was noted within BA439. This
anomaly was noted within close proximity to the existing Transco 30-inch pipeline and was interpreted as
modern debris associated with prior construction activities. There were no landforms identified within
BA439 that could be considered as high probability areas for prehistoric occupations. It was suggested in
Report No. 2413-1070

the 1981 Archaeological Assessment that the near-surface channel system and the outcropping clay
zone in Blocks 504, 505, 510, and 511, should be noted as areas for possible future research on
prehistoric human habitations.

V. Methods
Remote-Sensing Survey
Fugro GeoServices, Inc. (FGSI) acquired the high quality geophysical data aboard the Miss Emma
McCall on December 3 and 4, 2013. Sea conditions during data acquisition were moderate with seas
ranging from 4 to 6 feet and winds from 15 to 20 knots. The quality of the geophysical data collected
aboard the survey vessel was good. Horizontal positioning of the survey vessel was accomplished with
the FUGRO STARFIXï£¨ Differential Global Positioning System, which has a field accuracy of Â±1 meter.
Geophysical systems deployed included the Odom Echotrac Fathometer MKlll, EdgeTech 4200 side scan
sonar, SeaSpy Magnetometer and GeoPulse Pinger Sub-bottom Profiler.
Survey coverage consists of twenty-seven (27) north-south primary track lines (Lines 100-126) run at a
30-meter (~98.4 feet) line spacing and nine (9) east-west tie-lines (Lines 200-208) run at a 100-meter
(~328 feet) line spacing. To ensure record quality, several track lines were rerun and designated with a
letter suffix (Line 126A being a rerun of Line 126). Navigational fixes (shot points) were recorded and
annotated at 410-feet (125-meter) intervals on all data and the study maps. The cultural resources
remote-sensing survey encompassed over 219 acres of water bottom and involved approximately
132,872.00 linear feet (25.2 linear miles) of survey. The survey grid was designed to provide complete
coverage of the seafloor with the sonar and a thorough sampling with all other systems.

Data Processing
During the cultural resources remote-sensing survey, the Echotrac DF3200 MKIII bathymetric data was
collected using Starfix.NAV. The collected bathymetry data was then processed with the collected
navigation data. The soundings were then adjusted to compensate for the boat draft and transducer
depth. The digital echo sounder data were converted from two-way traveltime to depths in feet by
application of a harmonic mean velocity function derived from local velocimeter casts. The bathymetric
data was then tide corrected to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) datum based on the NOAA tide gage at
the USCG Freeport Station (28Â° 94.33â N, -95Â° 30.25â W). The water column velocity data, velocity
profile, and tide tables are included in Appendix B.
The SeaSpy Magnetometer data was collected using Starfix.NAV. Cable layback values were also
recorded using Starfix.NAV. The corrected navigation data as well as the collected layback value data
were processed using Starfix.PROC. The processed navigation data including layback values are
inserted into the collected magnetometer data utilizing Sonarwiz.map. Information regarding the SeaSpy
GSM-19MD Towed Overhauser Magnetometer and the above mentioned processing tools can be found
in Appendix C.
The Edgetech 4200 side scan sonar data was collected in raw XTF format utilizing Sonarwiz.map.
Navigation and cable layback values were recorded with Starfix.NAV. The corrected navigation data as
well as the collected layback value data were processed using Starfix.PROC. The raw XTFs were then
merged with corrected navigation data and processed utilizing Sonarwiz.MAP. Information regarding the
EdgeTech Model 4200 Side-Scan Sonar and the above mentioned processing tools can be found in
Appendix C.

Data Interpretation
Once the Towed Overhauser Magnetometer data was processed, Fugro researchers began interpretation
of the data utilizing SonarWiz for the identification of potential shipwreck sites. As it is impossible to
associate a specific magnetic signature to a shipwreck, more intensive methods of identifying shipwrecks
must be employed when interpreting magnetometer data. These methods include the characteristics of
the individual anomalies, association with other magnetic anomalies or side scan sonar contacts,
negative to positive amplitude ratio, and continuity.
The earth has an ambient magnetic field that ferrous metal objects deviate from. The magnetometer
detects these disruptions in the magnetic field. Because of this, the use of the magnetometer to locate
th
and identify shipwrecks is the most common and efficient method. All ships whether 16 century
th
wooden-hulled vessels or 20 century metal-hulled vessels have a magnetic signature. This is because
much of the metal used in the components of a ship are ferrous in origin.
One of the most widely used methods for identifying shipwrecks is the strength and duration of the
magnetic anomaly. Studies have shown that shipwrecks tend to have a magnetic strength greater than
50 gammas and durations of 80 feet or greater, âthe amplitude of magnetic anomalies associated with
shipwrecks vary considerably but in general the signature of large watercraft or portions of watercraft
range from moderate to high intensity (>50 gammas) when the sensor is at distances of 20 feet or soâ
(Pearson et al. 1990:70). In a recent report (Linden and Pearson 2014:12), Pearson has refined the
duration in this interpretative model to include magnetic targets of 50 gammas with a duration greater
than 65 feet.
Another method used was anomaly form. Magnetic anomalies are presented in the magnetic record as a
monopole, dipole, or complex anomaly. A monopole is a single spike or dip in the data stream. A dipole
occurs when a reading goes above and below the ambient magnetic field. A complex reading occurs
when there are several monopoles and dipoles grouped together as a single anomaly. Researchers
looked at the whether the anomaly was a monopole, dipole or complex formation. Shipwrecks were
thought to be dipoles or complex anomalies.
A cluster of magnetic anomalies that range in amplitude and duration is also another method used in the
identification of shipwrecks. Often a shipwreck occurs during a situation that results in damage to the
vessel. This means that as the vessel is sinking, parts of the ship are breaking or falling off. These
artifacts can leave a trail or debris field along the seafloor. Since many items within a ship are ferrous
metal these artifacts have their own distinct magnetic signature.
In recent years the methods have changed as a study conducted by Gearhart (2004) found that the
magnetic signature of a shipwreck tends to orient towards magnetic north. There are two different types
of magnetic orientation that a magnetometer can detect from an object. The first is permanent
magnetization and the second is induced magnetization. Individual artifacts with ferrous metal content
have a magnetic orientation created when the metal is heated above 770Â°C. This magnetic orientation is
set in whichever direction magnetic north is relative to the location the artifact is created. This magnetic
signature is known as the permanent magnetization. Permanent magnetization is much stronger that
induced magnetization on an individual object so when a group of these artifacts, each with their own
permanent magnetic orientation, are grouped together they cancel each other out. This leaves the
induced magnetic orientation as the strongest magnetic signature for a shipwreck. The induced
magnetization occurs after the artifact has cooled. This magnetization is a result of any movement of the
object where a very small number of particles in the object realign with true magnetic north.
In using this concept put forth by Gearhart, the best method to see whether a magnetic anomaly has a
stronger induced or permanent orientation is through contouring. Contoured magnetometer data will
show the orientation of a magnetic anomaly. If the anomaly has a stronger induced magnetization then
the negative polarity will point to magnetic north and the positive polarity will point to magnetic south (in
Report No. 2413-1070

the northern hemisphere). If the anomaly has a stronger permanent magnetization then the polarity of the
anomaly could point in any direction (Gearhart 2011).
Fugro GeoServices Inc. researchers interpreted the magnetometer data utilizing SonarWiz processing
and interpretation software. Each survey line was reviewed for disruptions in the earthâs magnetic field.
Once all survey lines were reviewed for magnetic anomalies, the researcherâs interpretation was exported
in DXF format to be imported in AutoCAD for the production of Study Maps.
The use of side scan sonar to detect shipwrecks has become the main method for deep water wrecks.
However for shallow waters it is used in conjunction with magnetometer data. Side scan sonar images of
shipwrecks, depending on sonar strength, often are complex with varying widths lengths and heights
within a single contact. As with magnetometer anomalies side scan sonar contacts of shipwrecks can
exhibit a trail or debris field. Finally a combination of multiple sonar contacts and magnetic anomalies
would signify a potential shipwreck.
Fugro GeoServices Inc. researchers interpreted the side scan sonar data utilizing SonarWiz processing
and interpretation software. Each survey line was reviewed for potential debris targets or disturbed
seafloor sediments. Once all survey lines were reviewed for sonar targets, the researcherâs interpretation
was exported in DXF format to be imported in AutoCAD for the production of Study Maps.

VI. Results
Bathymetry Analysis
The water depths were contoured at a one-foot contour interval as displayed on the enclosed
Archaeological, Bathymetry, and Hazard Map (Map 1). Water depths range from 59 feet to 60 feet below
mean lower low water. Bathymetric profiles reveal a slightly irregular seafloor sloping to the south (Figure
No. 3).
There were no topographic anomalies or relict coastal land forms identified on the bathymetry data that
could be interpreted as possible shipwreck remains.

Subbottom Profiler Analysis
The lowering of sea level during the Late Wisconsin Age was a response to expansion of the glacial ice
sheets in the polar regions of the continents. By the time of maximum glaciation, the storage of water in
the glaciers resulted in the lowering of sea level from about 300 to 500 feet below the present high stand.
This maximum Late Wisconsin sea level recession occurred between 24,000 and 12,000 years ago, and
much of the continental shelf was exposed as dry land at this time. The drop in sea level led to a
progressive lowering of stream base levels, and rivers entrenched channels and valleys into the upper
Pleistocene strata; the Pleistocene horizon outside the river courses became overconsolidated by
oxidation and weathering. Eventually climatic conditions warmed, and the meltwater runoff from the polar
ice caps gradually raised sea level. During this Late Wisconsin/Holocene transgression, there was a
gradual reduction in the gradients of the rivers entering the Gulf of Mexico, and the associated reduction
in carrying capacity of the rivers brought on a progressive infilling of channels and entrenched valleys.
The subbottom profiles were examined for evidence of former subaerial landforms that could have been
inhabited by prehistoric human groups. Regional geologic interpretations presented by Berryhill (1981 &
1986) have been reviewed to develop an overall framework for the observed subbottom features. Berryhill
reports that during the Late Wisconsin low stand, the area of Block 439, Brazos Area was situated within
the ancestral Colorado/Brazos delta system. Regional studies in the area indicate Late
Wisconsin/Holocene sediment thickness in the area is approximately 10 to 20 feet thick.

The subbottom profiler data recorded acoustic penetration to approximately 15 to 20 feet below the
seafloor (Figure No. 5). The sediment sequence consists of continuous, parallel, variable amplitude
reflectors. Attenuation of the subbottom signal occurs below this near seafloor sequence. Signal
attenuation is likely due to shallow subsurface gas that absorbs and distorts the seismic signal. The
biogenic gas accumulates from decomposition of organic material intermixed with rapidly deposited
Holocene prodelta and deltaic sediments associated with the ancestral Colorado/Brazos delta system.
The gas consists primarily of carbon dioxide and methane. Whelan (1977) suggests acoustically
impenetrable or turbid zones on high frequency seismic profiles can result from gas concentrations in
excess of 30 ml/liter.
Poorly defined marine scour features were noted downcutting from within 5 feet of the seafloor, however
due to the fragmented nature of these features, they could not be mapped across the survey area (Figure
No. 5). These features are completely gassed out, and no interior morphological features were
identifiable. These features are within sediments that have never been subaerially exposed since the
time of deposition, and would never have been inhabited prehistorically.

Side Scan Sonar and Magnetometer Analysis
The sonar was run at 300-600 kHz; data quality was good (Figure No. 4). The side scan sonar data
depicts an acoustically medium-textured seafloor devoid of any significant naturally occurring bathymetric
features. There were no seafloor targets noted on the sonograms. Numerous trawl drag marks and other
seafloor scars were noted on the data (Figure No. 4). Seafloor sediments in this area are reported to
consist of silty clay (M.M.S., Visual No. 3, 1983).
There were no unusual depressions, scours, sediment changes, or unidentified seafloor targets observed
within the survey area that could represent unidentified shipwreck remains.
The magnetometer recorded data on 100-gamma and 1,000-gamma scales at a one-half second sample
rate (Figure No. 6). The sensor was towed within 20 feet of the seafloor. Sensor depths below sea level
were annotated in the logs at the beginning and end of each track line (Appendix D).
The background noise was generally one to two gammas peak to peak. The magnetometer detected
three (3) anomalies within the area and they are all unidentified (Figure No. 6). The unidentified magnetic
anomalies recorded in the survey area range from 9-gammas to 75-gammas in amplitude and 191-feet to
245-feet in duration. All of the magnetic anomalies are listed and described in the Table of Magnetic
Anomalies in Appendix A, sequentially by anomaly number, and the anomalies are charted on the
Archaeological, Bathymetry, and Hazard Map and the Magnetic Contour Map, their positions corrected for
sensor setback.
Unidentified Magnetic Anomaly No. 1 (9 gammas / 191 feet) and No. 2 (16 gammas / 207 feet) exhibit low
amplitude and relatively short duration. These anomalies do not exhibit characteristic features usually
associated with shipwreck locations. It is highly unlikely these anomalies represent possible shipwreck
remains. These two (2) unidentified magnetic anomalies are interpreted as probable modern debris.
Unidentified Magnetic Anomaly No. 3 exhibited an amplitude of 75 gammas with a duration of 245 feet.
This dipole anomaly also exhibited a north over south orientation. Studies conducted by Pearson (1990)
and Gearhart (2004) concluded that magnetic anomalies representing shipwreck remains exhibited
certain characteristics. These characteristics include an amplitude greater than 50 gammas, a duration of
80 feet or more, dipole or complex in nature, and a north over south orientation. Unidentified Magnetic
Anomaly No. 3 possess all of these characteristics and therefore is interpreted as possibly representing
shipwreck remains. This anomaly should be avoided by 100 meters. This avoidance criteria has been
plotted on the Archaeological, Bathymetry, and Hazard Map and the Magnetic Contour Map.

A magnetic contour map was created depicting isolines at a 2-gamma contour interval illustrating the
complexity and intensity of the recorded magnetic anomalies (Map 4). The average magnetic ambient
field (gammas) for the survey area was removed from the collected magnetometer data set to establish a
positive/negative anomaly relationship. Positive gamma signatures are depicted as red isolines, while
negative gamma signatures are depicted as blue isolines.

VII. Conclusions and Recommendations
The evaluation of the high-resolution geophysical survey data from a survey conducted within Block 439,
Brazos Area, offshore Texas indicates that there were no landforms identified within the survey area that
could be considered as high probability areas for prehistoric occupations.
There were no sonar contacts identified within the survey area.
Unidentified Magnetic Anomaly No. 1 (9 gammas / 191 feet) and No. 2 (16 gammas / 207 feet) exhibit low
amplitude and relatively short duration. These anomalies do not exhibit characteristic features usually
associated with shipwreck locations. It is highly unlikely these anomalies represent possible shipwreck
remains. These two (2) unidentified magnetic anomalies are interpreted as probable modern debris.
Unidentified Magnetic Anomaly No. 3 exhibited an amplitude of 75 gammas with a duration of 245 feet.
This dipole anomaly also exhibited of a north over south orientation. Studies conducted by Pearson
(1990) and Gearhart (2004) concluded that magnetic anomalies representing shipwreck remains
exhibited certain characteristics. These characteristics include an amplitude greater than 50 gammas, a
duration of 80 feet or more, dipole or complex in nature, and a north over south orientation. Unidentified
Magnetic Anomaly No. 3 possess all of these characteristics and therefore is interpreted as possibly
representing shipwreck remains. This anomaly should be avoided by 100 meters. This avoidance criteria
has been plotted on the Archaeological, bathymetry, and Hazard Map and the Magnetic Contour Map.
There were no other unusual depressions, scours, sediment changes, unidentified magnetic anomalies or
unidentified seafloor targets observed within the survey area that could represent unidentified shipwreck
remains.
It is possible that historic shipwreck materials may not be detected by the geophysical instruments or may
be obscured by modern debris. If wooden planking or other cultural materials that could represent
shipwreck remains are encountered, field operations should cease and a representative from the Texas
Historical Commission should be contacted to provide further guidance.

â¢

Amplitude in Gammas - Maximum magnetic field deflection from crest to trough of an
anomaly.

â¢

Width in Feet - The distance from start of magnetic field deviation to end.

â¢

Monopole/Dipole/Complex - Description of anomaly signature. Either it has a positive
or negative field change (Monopole), the signature changes from positive to negative
across a single anomaly (Dipole), or the signature changes from positive to negative

STARFIX.HP
Starfix.HP High Precision
Starfix.HP (High Precision) is a dual frequency GPS carrier phase based service which offers sub-decimetre horizontal position accuracies (95%) at
distances up to 500km and 10cm horizontal position accuracies up to 1000km from the closest reference station. Vertical accuracies are 15cm and
30 cm, respectively. Fugro operates an extensive network of over 100 high accuracy dual frequency reference stations world-wide. The network
has 100% redundancy in both infrastructure and control.

Key Features:
Â

Â
Â
Â

Capable of 10cm (95%) accuracy in horizontal and 15cm (95%) in
vertical domain.
HDOP < 2.5 (Within coverage areas)
Dual delivery satellite beams â high power and low power
Extensive QC monitoring in line with UKOOA standards
Real-time system performance information available on-line
Compatible with existing SkyFix hardware

Starfix.HP Technology
GPS user accuracy is limited by how well the different error sources are known at the user location.
Standard DGPS techniques typically lump all errors (orbit, ionosphere, troposphere, clock, multi-path)
into a single range (Prc) and range rate (Rrc) term. As long as the reference and user GPS receiver
sees the same errors then the user position will be accurate to some level. As the distance between the
user and reference station increases, the effects of error de-correlation become significant, increasing
the position error observed by the user. As the solar activity has increased the effect of error decorrelation in the ionosphere is predominant compared to the other error sources.
By using dual frequency GPS receivers we can measure the true ionosphere at the reference and user
locations, substantially eliminating this error. Using these iono-free measurements with information
contained in the receiver carrier phase data, we are able to create wide area positioning results of
unmatched accuracy and performance.
Starfix.HP uses proprietary algorithms to provide 10cm level accurate positioning solutions.

HP Performance
Improved performance of decimetre level phase based systems is seen in the
difference between errors in Easting and Northing with HP (top) and VBS (bottom).
Regular movement in HP northing is reflected in HP Northing as vessel was at
harbour.

Starfix Subscription
In 2005 the Starfix network introduced Starfix subscription, it is now possible to
subscribe to the Starfix network only when required, providing a pay-for-use system
that is enabled and disabled without the need to remove hardware.

HP vs. VBS

HP Position Calculation
Starfix.HP is one of Fugroâs high precision GNSS services. GNSS stands for
Global Navigation Satellite System, which includes GPS, the Russian Glonass and
European Galileo systems. HP is currently based on GPS only, but Glonass and
Galileo are in the process of being implemented.
Starfix.HP is based on differential techniques, using a network of reference
stations to reduce or eliminate biases due to the troposphere, satellites orbits and
clocks. Ionospheric effects are eliminated by forming linear combinations of L1 and
L2 observations (the ionospheric effects are frequency-dependent). Data from the
reference stations is transmitted to mobile users using geostationary
(communication) satellites, like Easat, Amsat, etc. Fugroâs Starfix Satellite uplink
yard. Fugroâs global network of reference stations (together with the areas covered
by the geostationary satellites), provide the reference station data to users. Some
stations are used for services other than HP, such as standard DGPS, which
provide accuracies at the metre level.
Today precise (10-20 cm standard deviation) orbits and clocks are available in
real-time. For long baselines or when large height differences are involved,
tropospheric effects have to be estimated, whereas ionospheric effects are
eliminated, not by using a differential set-up, but by forming linear combinations
of observations. Another reason for applying differential techniques is that
convergence time can be reduced, since it allows for the resolution of the
integer ambiguities; however, this will work only for relatively short baselines.
The State Space corrections consist of the differences between precise
satellite positions and clock offsets, and those computed using the parameters,
transmitted by the satellites in their navigation messages. Starfix.HP
corrections are added to the parameters computed using the broadcast
navigation messages, resulting in precise satellite positions and clock offsets.

In the picture opposite an example of a convergence period for a
moving receiver is shown (HP).
The initial precision is comparable to the one obtained from
absolute positioning using code observations only. After a while,
the precision improves, due to the increased weight of the carrier
observations. RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) techniques take
advantage of the integer nature of the carrier ambiguities, but can
be applied to relatively short baselines only.
For HP, the baselines are in general too long to resolve the integer
ambiguities. As a result, the convergence takes a long time.
In general, a 45-60 minutes convergence period is acceptable for
HP users. However, sometimes lock to the GNSS signalâs is lost
due to obstructions or interference. In those cases, users donât
like to wait another hour before to reach decimetre accuracy.
Fugro has developed and implemented a technique for fast reconvergence, which makes it possible to bridge gaps in GNSS
signal reception of up to 60-90 seconds. Once the satellite
signals are re-acquired after a gap, positioning will almost
instantaneously revert to the high precisions available before the
gap.
Note: HP will start a convergence after each GPS interruption.

SKYFIX-XP
SkyFix-XP (Decimetric Differential GPS)
SkyFix-XP is a GPS positioning system that is based on clock and orbit corrections supplied by NASAâs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). SkyFixXP is a Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technology, which distinguishes itself from the traditional differential approach as satellite errors are not
lumped together but estimated per source, per satellite; it is also known as a âState Space solutionâ. The GPS clock and orbit corrections are
computed independently, free of ionospheric and tropospheric effects.

Key Features:
Â
Â
Â
Â
Â
Â
Â

Capable of 10cm accuracy in horizontal and 20cm in vertical domain.
Truly global coverage with no range restrictions from stations
Dual delivery satellite beams â high power and low power
Extensive QC monitoring in line with UKOOA standards
Real-time system performance information available on-line
Compatible with existing SkyFix hardware
Truly independent of Starfix systems

SkyFix-XP Technology
Traditional Differential GPS services use the fixed location of a single reference station to measure the
ranges to all GPS satellites in view. These measurements are then compared to the computed ranges
at that location and the resulting differences in the observations are transmitted as pseudo-range
corrections. This technique introduces some inaccuracies as the distance from the reference station
grows.
SkyFix-XP removes this range limitation by using a completely new technique known as Satellite
Differential GPS (SDGPS). Orbit and clock corrections are determined for each satellite continuously
utilizing Fugroâs global network of reference stations. These corrections are then broadcast to the user
and can be used at any location, regardless if the distance to any reference station, making the system
truly global.
The orbit and clock corrections are contained in a set of proprietary RTCM messages, which can be
received using the existing SkyFix decoders. Users require dual-frequency DGPS receiver as well as
the MultiFix 5 positioning and QC software. The high accuracy is obtained by new processing
techniques within MultiFix 5 that correct, estimate and /or eliminate the common GPS error sources
(orbits, clocks, troposphere, ionosphere, multi-path and noise).
Local tropospheric and ionospheric errors are corrected at the user end by using a dual GPS frequency
receiver. Multipath and receiver noise are addressed by using carrier phase observations within the XP
calculation.

Advantages of SkyFix XP
Â
Â
Â

A single set of corrections per satellite valid independent of the geographic location.
Independence from the existing Fugro reference station network
Simplicity for the user

Direct comparisons with competing providersâ capabilities and performance show that
Fugro continues to lead in accuracy and robustness of solution.

Quality Control and Verification
SkyFix-XP data is rigorously checked for accuracy, advanced statistical testing is performed using UKOOA recommendations. SkyFix-XP utilises
MultiFix 5, Fugroâs latest version of its GPS QC software. MultiFix 5 can also be configured with a number of back-up solutions for the primary
SkyFix-XP calculation to provide optimum redundancy. This allows the system to switch automatically to an alternative DGPS solution such as
SkyFix or SkyFix Premier. These back-up processes are performance (rather than availability) based, giving the operator maximum confidence in
the system.

Standard DGPS vs. SkyFix-XP
To provide a confirmation of accuracy, Fugro has installed regional monitoring systems located at key oil and gas hot spots around the world.
These provide real-time system performance information via the Starfix website (www.skyfix.com).

System Overview
The hardware configuration for SkyFix-XP is similar is similar to that of the standard SkyFix system, it is possible to share hardware or upgrade an
existing system with the addition of a dual frequency GPS receiver and the new MultiFix 5 software.
Typical SkyFix-XP system configuration:

The additional SkyFix-XP correction messages can be received with all existing SkyFix decoders. MultiFix 5 is compatible with most leading GPS
receivers including units produced by Thales, Trimble and Novatel.

ECHOTRAC MODEL DF 3200

The Echotrac DF3200 echo sounder (including the MarkII
and MarkIII series) by ODOM Hydrographic Systems, Inc.
collects analog paper records as well as digitized depth
information for output to a data logger. Digital depth data
can be logged direct to the navigation computer along with
date, time, and position for later post processing and
mapping. The system can be deployed on a small
workboat or inflatable, and includes a recording unit with
built in digitizer and transceiver, and a side mounted
transducer. The unit utilizes a combination of dynamic
gating and velocity fit to track the true bottom through
advanced microprocessor technology, solving the normal
problems associated with conventional depth sounders.
For example, if the "fixed gate" mode is activated, signal
digitizing can be restricted to a user-defined range,
rejecting unwanted returns during bar-check calibrations.
The acoustic pulse is generated with the Model OHS
200-24/9-19 dual frequency transducer, which operates
with a beam width of 9Â° at 200 kHz and 19Â° at 24 kHz.
The shipborn transceiver automatically adjusts power
output in proportion to the return signal yielding a clear,
unambiguous record in shallow as well as deep water.
The self-adjusting power varies from 1 to 225 watts at
200 kHz or 1 to 500 watts at 24 kHz. Return signals are
optimized by Time Varie d Gain and Automatic Gain
Control.
A thermal paper recording is printed in real-time where
automated scale changes prevent the bottom from
"running" off the chart. Scale widths are selectable in
either meters, 2 to 1,000, or feet, 10 to 3,000; however,
routine operating scales are 10 to 100 feet. Key system
parameters, i.e., velocity of sound, draft, and time, are
input from the recorder's front panel. A tide correction
may be introduced without altering the analog record in
any way. A line is added to the chart to indicate where
the bottom would be if corrected for water level.

GEOACOUSTICS GEOPULSE PINGER PROFILER
DESCRIPTION
The GeoAcoustics GeoPulse Subbottom Profiling System incorporates a variable frequency transducer array, which
consists of four transducers mounted on a plate at the end of an over-the-side gimbaled staff (Model 132) or the plate is
installed within a tow body (Model 136). Survey vessels owned and operated by FGSI are equipped with a transducer
array (Model 132) which is raised and lowered on an extending ram through the hull, amidships. The transducer array of
each system can be operated in:
â¢

"combined" mode where all four elements are driven by O.R.E. Model 140 10 kilowatt, variable frequency
Transceiver for maximum power;

â¢

"separate" mode with two elements driven by the transceiver and two used for listening (useful when a
wider beam width is desirable).

Records are obtained by first transmitting pulses of acoustic energy into the water column. Reflecting pulses from the
seafloor and substrata are received by the same transducer array used for transmission. Controlling beam widths of 55Â°
(3.5 kHz) to 30Â° (7.0 kHz) permit the operator to trade off between penetration and resolution while observing real-time
recordings. Other features include range gating, which allows scale changes to enhance structure details, and Time
Varying Gain, which triggers as the first bottom echo returns to optimize penetration without masking deeper reflections.
The Model 5210A Receiver combines the traditional compliment of filters, amplifiers, swell filter, TVG, and AGC
components. With a maximum gain of 100 dB, the 5210A allows an operator to process signals from 20 Hz to 15 kHz,
insuring compatibility with various seismic sources. A principal component of the Model 5210A is the provision of an
optical command key to the power supply. Requiring a key pulse from the graphic recorder, the key circuitry allows the
operator to manipulate the rate at which the power supply is triggered.
An integral part of the GeoPulse system is a built in "swell" filter. This adds the ability to compensate for vertical
displacement of both the source and the receiving array, which result from wave and swell action.
APPLICATIONS
The GeoPulse Model 5430A Transmitter is designed to operate with the GeoPulse Model 5210A Receiver to function as
a transceiver in a GeoPulse âpingerâ profiling system. It provides a powerful transmitted pulse at an operated selected
variable frequency, with an adjustable bandwidth, time varying gain receiver, to form a multi-purpose system applicable
to bathymetric surveys and/or subbottom profiling. The 3.5 kHz frequency in conjunction with the 10 kilowatt power
output generally achieves 20 to 100 milliseconds, or approximately 50 to 250 feet, of bottom penetration, detailing the
near-surface strata and density layers. The two-way travel time of the acoustic signal, from firing to receiving, is recorded
on an EPC Model 4800 (electrostatic) or Model 1086 (thermal) chart recorder. Travel time measurements are
subsequently applied to water column velocity information, system delays, and appropriate tow depth corrections to
calculate water depths and/or depths to subsurface events. The degree of ocean bottom penetration is variable
depending on properties of the bottom and near-surface materials, the output power, and carrier frequency. The pinger
is often used to supplement higher energy seismic systems or coring data to obtain accurate profiles of large areas.
When the pinger system is used in conjunction with the TSS Model 320 Heave Compensator, a portable system for
measuring the vertical motion of the transducer array, recorded images of the seafloor and subbottom profile are
enhanced. The obvious effect of unwanted vessel motion or varying depths of a towed transducer in deep water seafloor
mapping surveys is removed by integrating the heave compensator into the profiling system. Thus, the analog output of
the pinger profiles is effectively smoothed, permitting detailed interpretations of rugged terrain and complex subbottom
strata.

SONAR WIZ SUB-BOTTOM PROFILER

The Sonar Wiz Sub-bottom Profiler, by
Chesapeake Technology, Inc., is a high
resolution sub-bottom profiling system
that is dependable and precise, yet
simple to use. SonarWiz.SBP digitizes
sub-bottom profiler signals and
integrates navigation inputs to produce
high-quality georeferenced SEG-Y data.
SonarWiz.SBP interfaces with most
analog and digital sub-bottom profilers.
It includes support for thermal plotters for
hardcopy output in real-time and
playback, and features text annotation
support, cleverly stored in a user-defined
area of the SEG-Y trace header for
subsequent playback.
The Sonar
Wiz.SBP offers a redundant data
recording option, color and contrast
controls and a built-in deep water delay.
It interfaces with Hypack, NMEA-0183,
and contains custom navigation
interfaces, while working in meters, feet
or milliseconds.
SonarWiz.SBP continues to be the most
versatile and preferred choice for high
quality sonar data acquisition and
processing software.

Features
* Real time seismic data display and playback
* Amplitude scope trace monitor
* Digital recording in 16-bit SEG-Y format
* Flexible internal or external event generation
* Built in deep water delay
* Multi-ping support for high resolution coverage in
deep water
* 64, 32 or 20kHz sampling rate with 16-bit
resolution
