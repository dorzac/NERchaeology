MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Archeologists from Geo-Marine, Inc., were subcontracted through Prewitt and Associates, Inc., of
Austin to conduct National Register of Historic Places evaluative testing at archeological site
41TR170, located in Tarrant County, Texas. This work (Geo-Marine project number
30353.06.02) was conducted for the Environmental Affairs Division of the Texas Department of
Transportation under contract/work authorization 57524SA006. The archeological remains are
located on and in the alluvial terrace of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, within the proposed
130-meter-wide right-of-way of State Highway 121 in southwestern Fort Worth. The work was
conducted to comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1969, as
amended (Public Law 89-665); the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89670); and the Antiquities Code of Texas, as incorporated into Title 98, Chapter 191, of the
Natural Resources Code of Texas of 1977, as amended. The work was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 3699 issued by the Texas Historical Commission.
A three-stage field tactic was used during the testing of the site. Stage 1, conducted between
March 15 and 29, 2005, consisted of archeological monitoring of the mechanical excavation of 28
backhoe trenches, followed by geomorphological field studies of the trench profiles. Trenches
were placed both north and south of a relic channel of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River; the
present channel was formed in the late 1960s by river-straightening channelization efforts.
Efforts were made to ensure archeological sampling of all feature- and artifact-bearing areas
previously identified in trenches dug during the 2000 archeological survey. The second stage,
which occurred between March 21 and April 29, 2005, involved the manual excavation of 10 test
units to depths of 2 meters below surface using standard 10-centimeter-thick levels. The purpose
of this phase was to assess the reliability of the backhoe trench monitoring activities and to locate
occupation zones worthy of further excavations. The third stage of field investigations was
conducted between May 2 and June 3, 2005, and consisted of the mechanical stripping of the
overburden above target occupation surfaces and the manual excavation of three block
excavations, each 9 square meters, to a depth of 40 centimeters below surface. Upon completion
of the fieldwork, a fourth stage comprised a limited analysis to document the nature of the
recovered assemblage and to make National Register recommendations about the site, and a final
stage was to design a plan for further study or analysis that would then be based on the results of
an interim report.
iii

The geomorphic investigations, coupled with the processing of eight radiocarbon dates,
ascertained that the upper 2 meters of the Clear Fork sediments date to the past 2,900 years. All
trenches contained evidence of the regionally dominant West Fork paleosol that is buried under a
thin layer of recent alluvium. Beneath the West Fork paleosol were grayish and yellowish clayey
strata, and stringers of pea-sized gravels could be correlated to many of the trenches onsite. The
substrate for a series of trenches dug into the south edge of the site encountered cemented gravels
that likely date to the Pleistocene age. These gravels extend above the Holocene alluvial
sediments onsite and provide some minor relief above the floodplain. Although some
bioturbation has blurred boundaries between the West Fork paleosol and more recent sediments,
the degree of sediment movement is not as pronounced as observed in many other parts of Texas.
The excavations generally documented a series of low-density, highly stratified occupations that
could not be correlated with any great assurance. The site context and integrity of deposits are
generally excellent. Nevertheless, the paucity of remains in most areas is generally insufficient to
provide data necessary to address many regional research questions. Site 41TR170 is not unique
in this regard, because many sites within the Trinity River basin seem to be short-term specialized
logistical extractive activity areas rather than campsites. Two areas of 41TR170, however, seem
to be exceptions to low-density, brief occupations and contain a range of features unlike any
previously encountered or recorded in the Clear Fork of the Trinity River.
In an area located about 60 meters north of the relic river channel, Block 2 exposed part of a
deeply buried (180â220 centimeters below surface) ashy zone with abundant charcoal flecks and
burned clay daub that occasionally retained impressions of sticks and small posts. Three burned
rock features (small pits, scattered rocks, and rock dump concentrations) were found within this
ashy zone, but they were not associated with the genesis of the ash. Bone preservation in this
zone was good (numbering 121 specimens), but only one stone tool and four pieces of
manufacture/maintenance debris were found. Based on the stratigraphic position and the
recovery of one unclassified dart point, this feature is possibly Transitional Archaic in affiliation.
Indeed, four radiocarbon dates from two features and the top and bottom of the ashy zone
reaffirm that the occupation dates between A.D. 540 and 710 (two sigma dates, tree-ring
calibrated), and relates to the Transitional Archaic period. The genesis of the thick ashy zone is
problematic and not well understood. The radiocarbon dates suggest that the 40-centimeter-thick
ashy zone did not develop instantaneously but rather apparently accumulated over a span of about
180 years (ca. 1,270 and 1,450 years ago). Even though a few rock features and some relatively
high density of bone are preserved in this ashy sediment, the low density of remains suggests that
the deposit cannot be considered an occupation midden. The age range also suggests that this is
not a burned architectural structure. The formation process resulting in a 40-centimeter-thick
ashy zone remains unknown.
In an area almost 150 meters south of the relic channel, an extensive area of burned rock covering
at least 12-x-12 meters was encountered. Noncontiguous Blocks 1 and 3 were opened to explore
the variability of burned rock features and ascertain the kinds of remains present. The recovery
of two dart points (a Trinity and a Yarbrough) at comparable depths of 90 to 130 centimeters
below surface suggests that this area along the edge of the Pleistocene gravel terrace was
repeatedly occupied during the Late Archaic period. Among the burned rock features revealed in
Block 3 was one large incipient burned rock oven with a pit measuring 2.54 meters in diameter
surrounded by a discard ring of burned rocks that were only some 20 centimeters thick. Another
cluster of burned rock more deeply buried in the sediments suggests multiple occupations. In
adjacent Block 1 were two smaller (possible) pit ovens about 1 meter in diameter, an elongated
iv

pile of rock stored for reuse, a few rake-off piles or dumps, and one area of fitted burned rock that
might have served as a large griddle-like feature. Tools and chipped stone debris were
moderately abundant in Block 1, but rare in Block 3. Bone preservation in this area was very
poor, although several hundred fragments of scattered freshwater mussel shell were present.
Analysis of shell umbos or hinges indicates that about 59 shells were present in Block 1 and only
50 hinges in Block 3; none were concentrated into discrete discard features. The size, density,
and morphological variability of the burned rock features are unlike anything previously seen in
the Trinity River basin. Four radiocarbon dates from Blocks 1 and 3 suggest that the series of
occupations date between A.D. 540 and 780 (2-sigma dates, tree-ring calibrated). Indeed the
radiocarbon dates indicate that the activities resulting in the accumulation of dense burned rock
features exposed in Blocks 1 and 3 are culturally contemporaneous with the activities occurring in
the thick ashy zone located some 170 to 210 meters apart, even though they undoubtedly
represent multiple reuse of the area. The two areas may not have been occupied simultaneously,
for the low artifact density suggests that comparable groups of people from the Transitional
Archaic period made the distinctly different occupational signatures in the two areas.
The testing phase of work at 41TR170 has documented considerable variability in feature forms
during the Transitional Archaic period for the Trinity River basin. Test probes also strongly
suggest that many more burned rock features occur parallel to the Pleistocene gravel terrace. In
this regard, the testing has not exhausted the information potential related to the spatial patterning
in activities by these people. However, the associated stone, shell, and bone artifact assemblages
are relatively meager. Similarly, extensive flotation has failed to find any macrobotanical
remains other than a single nutshell and small amounts of wood charcoal. Efforts to retrieve
lipids samples from the burned rock feature proved to be successful, but the results were not very
helpful in providing insight into the diversity of feature activities. Although examination of more
burned rock features may stumble on examples of cooking accidents that preserve ancient
foodstuff, the current robust level of testing suggests that the information content from the site is
relatively limited. For this reason, even though the site is of considerable interest from a regional
perspective, the site seemingly does not have the potential to make further contributions to the
knowledge of the region. Thus, site 41TR170 fails to meet the standards of Criterion D or any
other significance standard required for assessing National Register eligibility. Site 41TR170 is
recommended as not eligible for National Register inclusion, and no further archeological
investigations are recommended.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

THE PROJECT
On February 4, 2005, archeologists from Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), were subcontracted through
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., of Austin to conduct National Register evaluative testing at
archeological site 41TR170 in Tarrant County, Texas. This work (GMI project number
30353.06.02) was conducted for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
Environmental Affairs Division (ENV) under contract/work authorization 57524SA006. The
archeological remains are located on and in the alluvial terrace of the Clear Fork of the Trinity
River, within the proposed right-of-way (ROW) of State Highway (SH) 121 in southwestern Fort
Worth (Figure 1). SH 121 is sponsored by the Fort Worth District of TxDOT, and cultural
resources testing is required to comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1969, as amended (Public Law [PL] 89-665), the Department of Transportation Act of
1966 (P.L. 89-670), and the Antiquities Code of Texas, as incorporated into Title 98, Chapter
191, of the Natural Resources Code of Texas of 1977, as amended.
The project was conceived by TxDOT ENV staff to secure information about the alluvial
depositional history and prehistoric cultural history of the site by examining its geomorphology,
archeological content, and artifact and feature abundance and diversity. Through these means, an
evaluation could be made regarding National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility of the
site by assessing whether it contains the information potential to contribute significantly to local,
regional, or national research issues. If information derived from artifacts, features, and other
forms of material remains were regarded as significant, additional investigations must be
undertaken to mitigate the effects of road construction on the cultural resources before the site is
adversely affected. If no significant data were recovered, then the site would be considered not
eligible for NRHP inclusion, and the proposed highway development could proceed without
further cultural resources concerns.
Insofar as archeology is a discovery process, TxDOT ENV prefers to contract testing and data
recovery investigations in three distinct phases: (1) development of the scope, budgets, and
permits for the fieldwork portion of the project, (2) implementation of field excavations and
development of an interim report and analysis plan, and (3) preparation of a detailed analysis and
final report. This tactic is used to evaluate the artifact returns and allow the contract archeologists
1

to focus studies on the range of materials actually recovered from the site, rather than being based
on optimistic expectations developed before the beginning of excavations. Initially, the portion
of site 41TR170 within the proposed TxDOT ROW was thought to be about 7 acres in size;
however, further examination of the aerial photographs ascertained that the site occurred within
an 11.5-acre area. Accordingly, the stipulated level of effort at the site was expressed as a range
in the numbers of backhoe trenches, test units, and block excavations. The field project
archeologists were given latitude to use field judgment to determine the appropriate point for
terminating the testing phase within the stipulated range of units placed, provided that the areas
were adequately covered and afforded a true assessment of the site.
The first phase of the project was conducted between February 4 and March 11 and consisted of
converting the contractual scope of work into a project scope, developing the field and interim
report budgets, coordinating with Native American groups, and applying for the Texas Historical
Commission permit. These efforts led to the issuance of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 3699
for conducting the testing phase investigations at site 41TR170.
The second phase of the testing project, as conceived by TxDOT ENV, consisted of three stages
of fieldwork and the development of an interim report. Stage 1 called for the excavation of
between 21 and 35 backhoe trenches and the description and interpretation of the sediments in
each trench by a professional geomorphologist. Archeologists monitored the mechanical
excavations of 28 trench holes and examined the corresponding backdirt, recording the presence
of artifacts and bone/shell ecofacts for each mechanically dug trench. The geomorphologist
described the trench profiles and collected samples for dating and sediment characterization. This
fieldwork stage was conducted between March 15 and 29, 2005.
Stage 2 also called for 10 to 17 test units, placed adjacent to backhoe trenches, to be manually
excavated in levels of 10 centimeters (cm) to depths of 2 meters (m) below surface (bs). These
units were a means of assessing the accuracy of the archeological monitoring of the mechanical
trench excavations and of obtaining data on the depth, occurrence, and abundance of
archeological remains. Most test units were required to be placed adjacent to positive trenches,
but a few must also be next to negative trenches to test the reliability of trench monitoring. A
total of 10 test units was excavated: nine next to trenches with positive artifact remains and one,
Unit 9, next to a trench without artifacts (Figure 2). Fieldwork for these investigations of 10 test
units took place between March 21 and April 29, 2005.
Stage 3 required the examination of between three and five targeted occupation zones, the
mechanical stripping of overburden, and the manual excavation of nine adjacent square meters in
each block to a depth of approximately 40 cm. The purpose of this stage was to examine the
occurrence of features and the density/diversity of archeological remains preserved in the site in
order to assess the integrity and information content from specific components. Excavators
examined three excavation blocks ranging from 90 to 180 cm bs during the period of May 2 to
June 3, 2005.
An interim report provided an overview of the background, methods, and fieldwork, as well as an
initial description of the features and preliminary tabulations and distributions of the recovered
archeological remains. Subsequent sections evaluated the information content and made
recommendations as to the kinds of analyses and specialized studies performed to understand the
results of the testing phase. A recommendation of the NRHP eligibility of site 41TR170 was
presented, justified by the kinds of information that could be extracted from this location to better
understand the sites in the region. Appendices provided data for materials and samples collected
from the testing phase of the project.
3

Due to the nature and diversity of the many burned rock features found on the site, the initial
interim report stipulated that the site was being recommended as eligible for the NRHP and that
further excavations would be prudent to salvage more data from the feature areas. A TxDOT
ENV review of the initial interim report determined that insufficient information about the
features was developed and that some additional processing of the site information was needed
before a concurrence decision could be made about the contractorâs recommendation. The
requested additional information included (1) the processing of a series of feature matrix flotation
samples in order to extract macrobotanical preservation data, (2) the radiocarbon dating of these
macrobotanical remains from several features to understand the age and chronology of the
cultural occupations, (3) the processing of some of the feature burned rocks to ascertain the
condition of prehistoric lipid remains, and (4) refinements in the counts of shells and bones to
ascertain the minimum number of individuals, rather than the count of fragmentary specimens. In
addition, TxDOT ENV requested that a regional overview of burned rock features be developed
for portions of the Trinity and Brazos river basins so that the contextual uniqueness of these kinds
of burned rock features could be interpreted. Information from these new kinds of data was also
to be integrated into the recommendation and summary portions of this current report.

HISTORY OF INVESTIGATIONS AT SITE 41TR170
Site 41TR170 was discovered in 2000 as one of two sites found during the surface and subsurface
survey of the proposed SH 121 across the Clear Fork of the Trinity River floodplain (Seibel et al.
2000:43). The second site, 41TR171, is along a T-2 terrace remnant on the north edge of the
Clear Fork floodplain and represents the remains of a historic ranch complex that contains mixed
historic and modern materials, but lacked integrity; it was recommended as not eligible for the
NRHP or for Texas State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation.
During the initial survey, archeologists from Hicks and Company dug a total of 37 shovel tests
and 17 backhoe trenches at 41TR170 along both sides of a natural meander channel of the Clear
Fork that was bypassed by the historically dug channelization process. During the survey phase,
numerous shovel tests were dug to depths of 100 cm bs, but at least one shovel test yielded
burned rock at a depth of 130 cm bs. The 37 shovel tests recovered at least 24 pieces of burned
rock, two flakes, 10 freshwater mussel shell fragments, five lots of charcoal, and one bone
fragment, and identified three rock features (Features 4, 7, and 8).
Most of the 17 survey phase backhoe trenches were dug to depths of 190 to 200 cm bs, but two
trenches recovered burned rocks from depths of 250 and 280 cm bs. These trenches recorded 26
lots of burned rock, six flakes, 22 lots of freshwater mussel shell (one lot had 35 shells with
umbos and likely was a feature), 10 lots of charcoal, and six lots of bone.
Hicks and Company archeologists defined the northern edge of site 41TR170 as the south edge of
the modern river channel and a hike-and-bike trail, and the southern edge of the site was
delineated by disturbances erroneously attributed to gravel-quarrying activities. The overall site
within the proposed ROW covers both sides of the old meander channel and reportedly measured
about 385 m (1,263 feet [ft]) north-south, by 128 m (420 ft) east-west. However, as noted below,
no gravel quarries are depicted on the 1981 aerial photographs, and the ranch manager (Scott
Walker, personal communication 2005) knows of no such activities occurring on this part of the
site.

4

Overall, the survey assessed 41TR170 as a highly stratified, low-density multicomponent, special
activity or brief campsite used by highly mobile peoples during the past two or more millennia.
The cultural remains within the proposed highway ROW cover about 11.5 acres on both sides of
the abandoned relic channel. Due to the presence of low-density archeological remains of lithics,
bone, mussel and snail shell, and burned rock associated with features, Hicks and Company
archeologists recommended that the site be tested to determine its eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP. That recommendation led to the present investigations at the site.

CHAPTER 2
BACKGROUND

This section summarizes the modern environmental conditions at the site and then provides a
brief overview of the cultural sequence known for the region. Particular attention is paid in the
environmental section to the local geology and geomorphology, as well as historic impacts, since
these have bearings on the overall site integrity and resource acquisition for the cultural features
discussed in later chapters of this report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Site 41TR170 consists of features and artifacts occurring along both sides of a relict channel of
the Clear Fork of the Trinity River in western Tarrant County. This area is in the Grand Prairie
portion of the Central Texas section of the southern Great Plains of North America (Fenneman
1931:9â10, 54â57, 1938; Kier et al. 1977). The Grand Prairie tends to be a relatively flat
landscape that slopes gently toward the southeast. Soils in this area are brown and lighter in color
than those of the adjacent Blackland Prairie to the east.

Topography
Site 41TR170 is located on the floodplain of the Clear Fork branch of the Trinity River at an
approximate elevation of 180 m (590 ft) above mean sea level. At this location, the alluvial fill of
the Clear Fork valley is about 935â1,635 m (3,065â5,360 ft) wide and is flanked by relatively
steep valley walls about 27.5 m (90 ft) in height before they transition into rolling upland hills.
The Clear Fork floodplain near the site drains from the southwest to the northeast in one of the
rare northeast-trending portions of the river. The floodplain elevation drops an average of 2.9 m
per kilometer (km; 15 ft per mile). Numbers of ridges intruding into the valley represent
remnants of Pleistocene terraces; one prominent ridge is located just upstream from the site and
gently rises some 9 m (30 ft) above the surrounding floodplain.

9

The archeological remains at 41TR170 occur on both sides of an incised relic river channel about
60 m (200 ft) wide that has cut less than 6 m (20 ft) into the old floodplain of the Clear Fork of
the Trinity River. The relic channel is currently dry, but the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
Benbrook 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle indicates that the main channel of the Clear Fork
was rerouted and straightened sometime between 1955 and 1981. Discussions with the property
manager indicated that the mechanical channelization occurred around 1968â1969, but before
then, the relic channel was the main river channel (Scott Walker, personal communication 2005).

Geology
The regional surface geology is composed of a series of Lower Cretaceous formations incised by
the channel of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River and filled with Quaternary age sediments.
Thus, within 2 miles of the project area, the earliest rock deposits consist of the Goodland
Limestone, overlain by the Kiamichi Formation, and in turn by the Duck Creek Formation (on the
west side of the valley) and the Fort Worth Limestone (on the east side of the valley). All of
these Lower Cretaceous formations contain limestone, but the Kiamichi alone reportedly also
yields sandstone (Barnes 1988). Potential bedrock exposures of these limestone resources range
from 700 m (2,300 ft) to 1,400 m (4,600 ft) away from the center of 41TR170, with the sandstone
resources potentially occurring about 700 m (2,300 ft) to the north and 1,160 m (3,800 ft) to the
south.
The Quaternary sediments within the Clear Fork near 41TR170 are constrained within a valley
935â1,635 m (3,065â5,360 ft) wide. These consist of both remnant Pleistocene fluviate terrace
deposits composed mostly of subangular limestone cobbles and Holocene fine alluvial sediments.
An extensive remnant of Pleistocene gravels projects into the valley immediately upstream from
the site. Undoubtedly, these gravels form the basis of the quarries reported by the Hicks
archeologists that created the southwestern site boundary and the occurrence of gravels
encountered in the lower deposits of the backhoe trenches placed along the southern edge of site
41TR170. Based on the size and angularity of the cobbles, and the fact that many of these rocks
were cemented with caliche, these cobbles were not the primary source of the stone used in the
burned rock features on the site.

Soils
The soils along the Clear Fork of the Trinity floodplain are classified as belonging to the FrioTrinity Association, a nearly level, deep clayey soil on floodplains (Ressel 1981). More specific
to 41TR170, detailed mapping of the site shows it to be on the Frio silty clay that is occasionally
flooded (Figure 3, areas marked 26). More technically, these constitute fine, mixed thermic,
cumulic Haplustolls, which simply mean that they are relatively soft, thick, dark-colored, humicrich sediments that formed from the decomposition of organic residues in the presence of
calcium-rich deposits under an arid moisture regime. The genesis of most of the organic matter is
derived from grasses and forbs, as well as modern plant roots.
One interesting aspect of the soil map as depicted by Ressel (1981:Sheet 41) is the presence of
small gravel quarries associated with Sunev soils that formed on the Pleistocene gravel remnant
that extends onto the floodplain southwest of the site (see Figure 3, areas marked 43, 44, 78, and
79). These quarries, however, are between 760 and 1,190 m (2,493â3,904 ft) away from the
10

center of 41TR170 at the relic channel and do not encroach on the southwestern limits of the site,
as suggested by Hicks and Company archeologists (Seibel et al. 2000). There is also a rather
large area of Arent soil at least 460 m (1,500 ft) south of the relic river channel and the middle of
site 41TR170 (see Figure 3, area marked 7). Arent soil deposits represent areas containing the
overburden from excavated sand and gravel quarries (Ressel 1981). Based on the aerial
photographs predating 1981 in the soil manual and discussions with the manager of the
landowning company, no extensive gravel quarries have encroached upon the edge of 41TR170
(Scott Walker, personal communication 2005). Quite likely, some exploratory trenching to assess
the quality of gravel deposits or trenching to control surface water flow may have occurred in the
area of the site, but these disturbances have not delineated the boundary of the site as suggested
by previous investigators (Seibel et al. 2000:18, Figures 4 and 5).

Hydrology
The Clear Fork is a main western branch of the West Fork that, along with the other two main
tributariesâthe Elm and East forksâmake up the Trinity River basin that drains most of
Northcentral Texas and empties into Trinity Bay at the Gulf of Mexico more than 560 km
(350 miles) to the southeast. The Clear Fork heads in northwestern Parker County and flows
southeastward for about 62 km (39 miles), before turning northeast and traversing another 24 km
(15 miles) to the confluence with the West Fork of the Trinity River. The Clear Fork is the first
main branch east of the Brazos River divide in the upper Trinity River basin. As the name
implies, the Clear Fork historically has been regarded as being of good water quality with
relatively low amounts of salts and other dissolved particles, and may have been a preferred place
for settlements.
Much of the water from the Clear Fork derives from a combination of surface runoff and
numerous springs (Brune 1981:352). As described in 1877, a pool of water at the headwaters of
the Clear Fork was 200 m (656 ft) long at the site of Poolsville, Texas; unfortunately, poor land
management decisions caused erosion of the Paluxy sands, and now this pool is completely filled
in. Numerous springs occurred all along the Clear Fork throughout Parker and western Tarrant
counties. Intense settlement of the region gradually lowered the aquifer levels and most springs
are no longer active.

Vegetation and Animals
Northcentral Texas consists of a series of relatively narrow, north-south alternating vegetation
bands of oak-hickory forests and open grasslands. From west to east, these are the Western Cross
Timbers, the Grand Prairie, the Eastern Cross Timbers, and the Blackland Prairie. Archeological
site 41TR170 occurs in the Grand Prairie portion of the region. Much of the native vegetation has
been destroyed by urban sprawl, but the Clear Fork bottomlands are covered in a dense growth of
oaks that represent the floodplain forests that once covered the region. The presence of thick
paleosol deposits, however, also suggests that dense stands of grass covered the region.
The region is also assigned to the Texan Biotic Province, which is representative of its
intermediate location between the grasslands of the Southern Plains to the west and the deciduous
forests of the Southeast. There are no endemic vertebrate species in the Texas biotic province,
but 49 species of mammals occur in the region. Important species that exist or once existed in the
12

area include white-tailed deer, bison, bear, squirrel, rabbit, and raccoon. Along with a wide range
of turtle, snake, frog, fish, freshwater mussel shell, and bird species, the region has a wide range
of resources for supporting indigenous groups.
Site vegetation consists mostly of dense stands of mature oak-hickory forest, with a dense
understory of greenbrier and acacia brush. Vegetation is especially thick where deep alluvial
sediments occur in the valley. Conversely, in areas of dense gravels near the surface, especially
along the southern margin of the site, aerial photographs show a marked decrease in the
upperstory tree cover. Likely, this marked and drastic vegetation change led the previous
archeologists to conclude erroneously that the southern boundary of the site had been quarried in
the past.

Climate
The climate of Tarrant County is classified as subtropical with humid, hot summers and mild
winters, except when âblue northersâ blow in periodically. A wide range of annual temperature
extremes characterizes the region. Periods of cold temperature are short-lived; temperatures
falling to or below 20oF average only six days per year. For Tarrant County, the records for daily
extremes reflect a low of -8oF in February 1899 and a high of 113oF in June 1980. Typically,
temperatures average 47.4oF in the winter season (DecemberâFebruary) and 83.3oF in the
summer season (JuneâAugust) (Ressel 1981:Table 2).
The region has an average annual precipitation of 81.5 cm (32.1 inches [in]); the greatest amount
occurs in April and May, when slightly more than a quarter of the annual precipitation falls
during the summer. Indeed, about 60 percent of the precipitation occurs during the six-month
interval of April through September. Rainfall usually occurs at night with an average of about 44
rainfall events a year. The maximum historically recorded one-day rainfall amount on record is
24.3 cm (9.57 in), which happened in 1932. Only 7.4 cm (2.9 in) of precipitation fall on average
as snow, and frozen precipitation occurs in three of four years. Hailstorms typically occur on two
or three days a year. The region has on average 249 freeze-free periods.
The region receives sunshine about 76 percent of the time. The prevailing winds are usually from
the south, and the highest speeds reach 22.5 km (14 miles) per hour in March and April.

Geomorphology
Studies elsewhere in the Trinity River basin have identified a series of Holocene-aged cut-and-fill
alluvial sequences that seem to correlate across the river basin and indeed correlate with events
identified in the Colorado and Brazos rivers. In addition, during periods of terrace construction,
the vegetation cover (probably grasslands) contributed organic carbon at a rate faster than
sediment deposition, resulting in a series of buried soils and the accumulation of soils as the
terrace treads aggraded. These soils have been named and radiocarbon-dated at several locales
across the Trinity River basin. The following is an overview of the geomorphic situation
expected for the region.

13

From studies elsewhere in the upper Trinity River basin, it is likely that as many as three
alloformational stratigraphic units comprise the Holocene terrace (Ferring 2001:28â39). Each is
marked by an erosional unconformity at the top and pedogenic or soil development. Along the
Elm Fork, these consist of the Aubrey Alloformation, dating ca. 14,200 to perhaps 13,400 years
ago, at the bottom; the Sanger Alloformation dating between 10,900 and 5,700 years ago; and
capped by the Pilot Point Alloformation that dates from 4,525 to about 700 years ago (Ferring
1990a:47â48). The Arlington paleosol developed in the upper part of the Sanger Alloformation
depositional unit, whereas the West Fork paleosol developed in the Pilot Point Alloformation. In
some places, an unnamed recent alluvium measuring up to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) thick caps the Pilot Point
alluvium, and it too has developed a pronounced soil in some places.
Most of the mechanical excavations at 41TR170 were restricted to the upper 2 m (6.6 ft) of the
deposits and primarily examined the recent sediments, the West Fork paleosol, and some of the
underlying sediments. In this report, Ferringâs terms for the allomorphic depositional packages
(e.g., Pilot Point, Sanger, and Aubrey alluvium) are not used, in part due to the shallow depth of
the mechanical trenching and in part due to the recent age of the radiocarbon dates (spanning only
the past 3,000 years). Instead, material correlations are tied to the stratigraphic position relative
to the prominent West Fork paleosol identified in all trenches onsite. Nonetheless, because of the
extent of meso- and micro-scale bioturbation in the sediments at 41TR170, stratigraphic
unconformities so easily observed elsewhere on the Southern Plains (including the top of the
West Fork paleosol) are difficult to identify. All or nearly all of the sediments and the associated
archeological remains exposed in the trench profiles likely relate to the Pilot Point and recent
sediments. However, further contemplation of how the stratigraphy of 41TR170, especially
involving the clays and dense gravel deposits along the southern edge of the site near Trenches 18
and 19 and Blocks 1 and 3, relates to Ferringâs (1990) Trinity River regional stratigraphic model
is under consideration. At this time, none of the cultural deposits from the site appears to be more
than ca. 3,000 years old.

Historical Impacts and Land Use
Site 41TR170 occurs on relatively undeveloped lands owned by Edwards Geren Limited, which
operated the area as a ranch since the area was settled. Overall, little development is evident
relative to the housing and business developments that surround the remaining ranch lands. The
property is still used as a ranch and is leased for raising cattle.
Aerial photographs show small gravel quarries on the Pleistocene terrace remnant that are located
about 760 m (2,500 ft) south and 1,190 m (3900 ft) southeast of the relic channel at 41TR170
(Ressel 1981:Sheet 41). As discussed above, a large area of Ardent soils that represent
overburden from quarry activities is located some 460 m (1,509 ft) to the south of the site. The
source of this fill is unknown, but it may be possible that some quarrying has occurred in this area
460 m south of the relic channel. The date of these possible gravel-quarrying operations is
unknown. However, none of these areas impact site 41TR170.
Despite the rural nature of the area, several recent changes have modified the land (Scott Walker,
personal communication 2005). In 1963, a large sewer line was installed at a depth of about 6 m
(20 ft) across the property and crosses 41TR170, and the SH 121 highway is proposed north of
the relic channel. The sewer line was upgraded in the 1990s, and it currently has access manholes
spaced along the route; the alignment serves as one of the main access routes through the wooded
bottomlands.
14

As mentioned above, in 1968 or 1969 the new channel of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River was
excavated to a depth of more than 4 m (13 ft) and perhaps a width of 60 m (197 ft) into the
floodplain to straighten and deepen the riverbed to reduce the risk of flooding. This
channelization left the older channel dry. The original depth of the relic channel and the amount
of historic infilling is unknown. Current attempts to trench the bottom of the relic channel along
the edges of the sewer line ROW were completely thwarted in three trenches by the presence of
massive (2+ m long by roughly 1 m thick) limestone blocks that seem to have been set or placed
together and buried under about 0.5 m of sediment. Although it is possible that these blocks and
the channel infilling occurred simultaneously with the channelization project, the effort to fit
blocks together (if valid) in the relic channel seems at odds with the need to haul away quantities
of fill from the major excavation effort. The placement of these blocks along the sewer line road
and tens of meters west of the road in the channel bottom either might reflect early flood
control/bank stabilization efforts or might possibly be related to the sewer line development. The
date of the placement and the depth of fill added to the relict channel are unknown.
Shortly after the river was diverted, a second raw sewer line was installed from a private school
located on the hills south of the Clear Fork. This second pipeline was placed in the ROW
corridor of the first pipeline, but it is not marked on the surface, and the depth and precise
location are not known.
During the early 1990s, a housing development was established on the floodplain east of the main
ranch property. Although the deepened river channel was regarded as adequate to remove waters
coming down the Clear Fork, concerns arose over secondary flooding from adjacent hillslope
runoff. To diminish that possibility, a bulldozer informally recontoured the lands in 1990 or
1991. Some gullies were bulldozed to straighten or redirect surface runoff, and a large berm or
earthen dike was built from the sewer line road, angling toward the northeast and stopping at the
property edge of the public hike-and-bike trail. Other modifications may include various
bulldozer cuts that, when coupled with the marked vegetation shifts over the dense gravel areas,
may have been misconstrued as the edge of gravel quarry operations near the site.
The final modification of unknown age is the creation of a series of hike-and-bike trails, some in
gravel and others in concrete, built on publicly owned property on both sides of the constructed
river channel. Some branches of the trail east of the site cut down the embankment and cross the
Clear Fork by means of a bridge. Periodically, benches have been placed along the trail to
enhance public use. The trail and the adjacent property fence line constitute the northern edge of
the site as defined during the initial survey.

CULTURAL OVERVIEW
Several major reports concerning the archeology of the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987, 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize most of the
history of archeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the culturalhistorical framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have resulted in recording numerous sites, it is apparent that much research remains
to be done.

15

The chronological framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed. Prikryl
(1987) has presented a chronological sequence of six prehistoric periods based primarily on
cross-dating diagnostic projectile point forms from mostly surface contexts, and the sequence
based on Joe Pool Reservoir investigations adds a Protohistoric period (Table 1; Peter and
McGregor 1988). For purposes of this report, in light of the radiocarbon dates on geomorphic
contexts that indicate the deposits date to the past 2,900 years and based on the few diagnostic
dart points recovered from site 41TR170, the following summarizes only the Archaic through
historic sequences.

Archaic Periods
The Archaic period in Northcentral Texas is tentatively dated between 6550 B.C. and A.D. 700.
As is true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of Early, Middle,
and Late subperiods, has been applied in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990). Thus, the Early
Archaic has been dated from 6550 to 4050 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4050 to 1550 B.C., and
the Late Archaic from 1550 B.C. to A.D. 700. Archaic remains are usually found in upland
settings and are frequently mixed with later material. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic
period in Northcentral Texas (Crook and Harris 1952) that defined the Carrollton and Elam foci
was based upon materials from such mixed terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space
constructs are no longer recognized as being acceptable for this area of Texas (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). General trends that have been proposed
as characterizing the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas include an increasing complexity of
settlement systems, increasing population size and density, decreasing mobility, and the
development of distinct group territories (Prikryl 1990; Story 1985:52).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 6550â4050 B.C.), in general, the occurrence of small and widely
distributed sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly defined
territories, with a generalized hunting-and-gathering economy (Story 1985:35, 39).
Unfortunately, Early Archaic occupations in Northcentral Texas are poorly documented, and no
sites with isolated Early Archaic components in this area are known (Prikryl 1990). Based on
16

surface collections, Prikryl (1990) hypothesizes a generalized hunting-and-gathering economy
during this period, with high group mobility, a lack of regionalization, and âlittle in the way of
recognized territorial boundariesâ (Prikryl 1990:71). Projectile point forms that may be
associated with the Early Archaic in Northcentral Texas include Early Split Stemmed and
possibly Angostura points (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990b:Figure 31).
In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period in Northcentral Texas (4050â1550
B.C.) is even less well known. Fewer sites are known with Middle Archaic components than for
any other period, but the few surface collections available suggest the beginnings of regional
cultural differences by the end of the period (Prikryl 1990). Diagnostic dart points that may be
associated with the Middle Archaic include the Basal Notched group (which includes Calf Creek,
Bell, and Andice), Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990b:Figure
31). An intact Middle Archaic component was identified at the Calvert site (41DN102) at Lake
Ray Roberts and is summarized by Ferring and Yates (1997:305):
Hearths, a burial, an unmixed assemblage of artifacts and fauna provide new evidence of adaptations to
a drier middle Holocene landscape. Artifact types are similar to those from adjacent regions (Story
1990) suggesting broad cultural interactions. The foraging economy emphasized procurement of small
game and deer. It is assumed that these people were quite mobile, as repeated occupations of the site
during the Middle Archaic period are evident.

Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period in Northcentral
Texas (ca. 1550 B.C.âA.D. 700), as indicated by an apparent increase in the number of sites, a
greater distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of decreasing mobility (Prikryl
1990). At the same time, as group mobility may have become more limited, interregional contact
may have diminished. If greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling error due to
unequal destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system making increasing
use of all available floral and faunal resources. Throughout Northcentral Texas, Late Archaic
period occupation sites are relatively common in the uplands, and a relatively large number of
shallow buried sites are known from the Trinity River floodplain (Ferring 1990a:51). Dart points
that may be diagnostic of the Late Archaic include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Ellis,
Trinity, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990b:Figure
31).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and
Yates 1997) indicate that remains of the Late Archaic period are characterized by assemblages
apparently left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a
limited time and then moved to another locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied
numerous times on a seasonal basis. Faunal remains indicate that Late Archaic populations
exploited a mix of prairie, forest, and riparian species, with white-tailed deer, rabbit, turtle, and
freshwater mussel shells being primary food resources (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). The results of
investigations at numbers of Late Archaic sites at Lake Ray Roberts are summarized by Ferring
and Yates (1997:305).
The most substantial occupations of the project area took place in the later part (post-3,000 yr b.p.) of
the Late Archaic period. This is clearly a broad regional trend . . . although poor site exposure limits
our understanding of earlier periods. Late Archaic sites here uniformly register mobile foragers that
exploited all habitats available to them. Residential mobility . . . is implied. Repeated occupations at
multiple sites were characterized by use of rock-lined and unlined hearths. On stable surfaces these are
recorded as rock middens. In aggrading environments, discrete hearth construction events are clear.
17

Import and curation of chert tools is evident, and contrasts with core-biface curation in the Middle
Archaic period. Chert was preferentially used for straight, expanding and corner-notched points, while
local raw materials were reduced on-site and dominate the contracting-stemmed forms. Despite quite
good resource availability, dietary stress is recorded from skeletal and dental analyses. . . .

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of what is called the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin (ca.
A.D. 700â1700) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the
start of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage
to the west. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) propose that the Late Prehistoric period be
divided into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the
foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting
Southern Plains influences. In this view, the early phase dates between A.D. 700 and 1200, and is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba
arrow points (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). The late phase dates from A.D. 1200 to 1700 and is
associated with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various
unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Maud, Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), and the Perdiz point
(Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites
of this period.
Investigations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988)
have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has yielded
house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules.
Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or
early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive
Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred, in at
least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that
ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarize the results of that research:
There are no woodland-like sites in north central Texas, suggesting that Plains Woodland influence or
contact did not characterize the transition to the Late Prehistoric period. No ceramics were found with
LPI [Late Prehistoric I] assemblages, which have Scallorn, Alba and small Gary points. These appear
to be short-term occupations that took place under conditions of reduced precipitation compared to the
Late Archaic. Except for the replacement of darts with bow-arrow weaponry, these occupations are
essentially similar to the Late Archaic. Regional exchange of technological information, rather than
environmental change, probably is the factor behind the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric shift.
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites,
which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500â650 yr b.p. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the LPII faunas indicate a foraging strategy that emphasized deer
procurement, and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw materials was about
as frequent as in the LA, and long-distance raw material acquisition (e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not
evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced shell-tempered wares, which by this
time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally. As recorded by previous synthesis
18

(Story 1990), little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts
prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of the LP period largely
independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.

In light of these results, the status of the Cobb-Pool site is even more striking. Whether the CobbPool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive change separate
from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however, recent analysis of a
Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in Dallas County also
suggests maize consumption. The individual was a female around 50 years old. Radiocarbon
dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155â1275; a carbon isotope ratio of
-17.7 â° suggests that maize was consumed, but it did not form a major part of her diet (Peter and
Clow 1999). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a small grouping of disturbed
human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) in Dallas County. This site,
located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River), yielded remains of at
least four individuals, dated by tree-ring calibrated radiocarbon dates on bone collagen to cal A.D.
1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although shell beads and a shell
gorget were present; a carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 â° suggests that the groupâs diet was not high
in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the Harbor Pointe burials compared
to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is possible that maize agriculture was introduced to the Dallas area
ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this same evidence may indicate that divergent subsistence patterns
were practiced by groups in the Dallas area.

Protohistoric Period and Historic Native American Groups
Within Northcentral Texas, the time from A.D. 1600 to 1800 has been designated the Protohistoric
period. Prior to the founding of New Mexico in 1598, European presence in the Southwest and
on the Southern Plains had been sporadic at best (Coronado in 1540â1541, the RodriguezChamuscado party in 1581, Espejo in 1582â1583, etc.). However, after 1598, Spanish influence
was never absent from the Southern Plains, although actual contact with Europeans continued to
be limited and there are only brief records of journeys into or through the area. Despite this, it
was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that the physical presence of Europeans on
the Southern Plains became commonplaceâthe result of increasingly peaceful relations between
the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north, and the acquisition of Louisiana by the
United States in 1803. Prior to about 1725â1750, Apachean groups appear to have dominated the
western portion of the Southern Plains, known as the High Plains, but after this time the area was
increasingly controlled by the Comanche and Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern
Plains, within the area now known as the Lower Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes
became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman 1989:91).
Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River
basin during the Protohistoric period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were
residing in the Dallas/Fort Worth area at the beginning of this period. What is clear is that the
Protohistoric period in Northcentral Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and
amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993). Available data suggest that many, if not all, aboriginal
occupants of the eastern margin of the Great Plains, including Northcentral Texas, were Caddoan
language speakers, from the Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this
light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested that the Socoatino, who were encountered
by the survivors of the De Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and
19

were the same group as the Canohatino identified by the French in the latter part of the
seventeenth century. The latter group was apparently located at that time âon the Blackland
Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin,
and Wacoâ (Newcomb 1993:24). If the prehistoric occupants of the eastern plains margin in
Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers, then it would explain how these groups were absorbed
very early into other Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni,
Taovayas, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in Northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth
and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form the historicera Wichita Tribe, but some were probably absorbed by the united Caddo tribes, and some may
even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa, during the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Many of these groups along with the Comanche were
called the NorteÃ±os by the Spanish, and the historic archeological remains of these peoples
postdating ca. 1750 are designated the NorteÃ±o Focus for the region.

Historic Utilization and Occupation
The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have occurred in 1542 when the
remnants of the De Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered the area that
would become present-day Texas in an effort to find a land route to New Spain. Some
researchers believe that the expedition crossed Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61),
although others place the route much farther to the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991;
Chipman 1992). A consistent European presence to the region did not occur until the early
1700s, when French traders from Louisiana began to move west along the Red River. French
traders were residing among the fortified Wichita villages near Spanish Fort, Texas, and were
probably partly responsible for inciting the raid against the Spanish missions.
The earliest recent history of Tarrant County is poorly documented. The first Euro-Americans to
settle in the region were primarily from Arkansas Territory. In 1840, Capt. Jonathan Bird and a
small group of settlers (commonly referred to as Peters Colonists) established a blockhouse called
Birdâs Fort along the West Fork of the Trinity River. The fortâconsisting of three buildings
surrounded by a stockadeâwas inadequately manned to be a significant defensive locale against
roving Apache and Comanche and instead served as a trading station rather than a fort.
Additional families joined the initial occupants of Birdâs Fort in the fall of 1841, but the fort was
entirely abandoned by the spring of 1842.
In 1845, a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Springs (later named Mary Le Bone
Springs) along Johnson Creek (formerly called Mill Creek). Although Werdmanâs (1969:10)
account of its location suggests either a Rush Creek or Johnson Creek location, an 1872 map of
Texas (Petermann 1872) places Marrow Bone Springs on Johnson Creek. Col. Middleton Tate
Johnson and a company of Texas Rangers also established their headquarters at Marrow Bone
Springs in 1847. Two years later, Colonel Johnson received a land grant for his services, and he
established a plantation near Marrow Bone Springs. The community that grew around the
colonelâs plantation came to be known as Johnson Station.
Shortly after the establishment of Johnson Station, Camp Worth was established in 1849 at the
junction of the Clear and West forks of the Trinity River in order to provide protection for settlers
along the western frontier. In the same year, Colonel Johnson was instrumental in the political
process of establishing Tarrant County. By 1860, the population of Fort Worth had grown
20

sufficiently to cause the county seat to be moved from Birdville to Fort Worth. The coming of
the railroad and the discovery of oil after 1900 significantly affected the economy and market
accessibility of the area.

METHODS

The methods used for testing 41TR170 are based on the three field stages, as outlined in Chapter
1. This section reiterates and expands upon the methods used to test the site. All reported field
investigations occur within the known footprint of the proposed roadway. In order to guarantee
this claim, the aerial photographs used in the projectâs environmental assessment posted on the
TxDOT website were downloaded, rectified to standard geo-coordinates. The Universal
Transmercator (UTM) locations of the ROW margins were ascertained for the following points:
(1) the east and west edges of the ROW along the fence line forming the northern boundary of the
archeological site as defined by the archeologists from Hicks and Company; (2) the east and west
boundaries of the ROW in the river channel meander, (3) the east boundary of the project ROW
along the northwest-southeast âsewer lineâ road across the site, and (4) the east and west
boundaries along the southern edge of the site as measured from the aerial map provided in the
Hicks and Company report. The various points were plotted in the field and demarcated by
flagging tape in lieu of any other engineering data. The TxDOT protocol for dealing with human
remains was stipulated as part of the permit application; since no human remains were found,
those procedures are not discussed in this report.

STAGE 1: BACKHOE TRENCHING AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
The first stage of fieldwork consisted of the excavation of standard backhoe trenches, which were
monitored by archeologists and described by the project geomorphologist, Dr. Stephen Hall. The
THC permit guidelines stipulated that the actual number of trenches to be dug (between 21 and
35) depended upon the frequency of trenches containing observed artifacts (burned rock and
chipped stone tools) and ecofacts (bone, shell) and the adequacy of site sampling across all areas
of the site within the proposed ROW. If backhoe trenches sampled all portions of the site within
the ROW and artifact/ecofacts were found in at least 15 to 20 trenches with materials, then the
total number of trenches could be scaled down below the maximum number of 35. The
placement of many of the trenches within the project ROW was based on the judgment of Dr.
Hall to maximize the information retrieval for the geomorphological study of the Clear Fork of
the Trinity River. Secondary consideration was to ensure that all areas identified by the Hicks
and Company archeologists as containing artifacts and features were trenched. Some of the GMI
trenches were placed to cover areas not intensely investigated during the survey. Based on the
stipulations outlined above, an initial 28 backhoe trenches were dug at the site (Table 2). In most

cases, considerable effort was spent in mechanically clearing small brush from the dense
vegetation cover on the site, although every effort was made to honor the landownerâs request not
to knock down trees larger than 15 cm (6 in) in diameter. A few supplemental trenches (Trenches
AâD) beyond the initial 28 were dug late in the testing program, especially near Blocks 1 and 3,
to ascertain the extent of cultural burned rock or define the depths of deposits. Since these
trenches were placed to refine the extent of materials, the project geomorphologist did not have
the opportunity to see or document these latter trenches.
The backhoe trenches were demarcated by numbered pieces of flagging tape tied to adjacent
brush, and the locations were recorded using a global positioning system (GPS). The backhoe
trenches ranged from 3.8 to 16.3 m (12.5â53.5 ft) in length. Mechanical excavations were
conducted with a toothed bucket to various depths, with an estimated average of 20â30-cm (7.9â
11.8 in) intervals, to a depth of 200 cm (78.8 in) due to the density of roots in most areas of the
site. Actual depths of mechanically dug trenches ranged from 1.80 to 2.68 m (5.9â8.8 ft), except
for three trenches that were terminated when encountering limestone blocks placed in the old
meander channel as an early bank stabilization effort.
Two archeological monitors were present during the trench excavations. The goal of monitoring
mechanical excavations was to identify locations where artifact density was high enough to be
readily detectable and, therefore, potentially exploitable for a data recovery excavation. These
areas were to be verified by the manual excavations of the 1-x-1-m test units, and the importance
of some areas was to be assessed through the excavation of the small blocks to obtain data on
material abundance, diversity, and spatial distribution. Although the monitoring process was
uneven at the outset of the program, the team of monitors developed a routine geared toward
watching for and recording the occurrence of buried materials onsite. In principal, one monitor
watched the excavation process to identify in situ materials, and to measure and record the
general depth of the trench at each pass of the bucket; the second monitor watched the dumping
of the back dirt, looking for bone, burned rock, freshwater mussel shell, or other materials
showing up in the spoil pile. The second monitor also used a shovel to probe the back dirt to
check for materials, but no effort was made to systematically screen samples of the back dirt.
The removed fill was probed as a standard good faith effort to find artifacts that would likely be
used by monitors on other projects. When artifacts were noticed, the monitors used a monitoring
form to record their discoveries, along with the trench number and relative depth of the identified
materials. Unless the objects were diagnostic implements, little attempt was made to collect
fragments of burned rock, shell, and bone. In practice, the attempt to gather depth observations
on artifacts was not as smoothly implemented as desired.
Even though microtopography is clearly evident on the landscape, no attempt was made to
compile a topographic map of the alluvial terrace due to the dense vegetation cover over most of
the site. Instead, the locations of the backhoe trenches were documented using a GPS device, and
the results were imposed over the project area aerial photograph. The GPS data were also used to
document trench locations sketched on 11-x-17-inch graph paper that was annotated and used as a
guide for plotting observations throughout the field project. Additional data about the size and
depth of each trench were manually recorded and retained.
Upon completion of the excavations, the project geomorphologist photographed and provided
geomorphic descriptions of each trench. Typically, the machine-smeared wall was cleaned prior
to making descriptions, and standard soil taxonomy methods were used to provide a measured
description of a representative wall from each trench. The geomorphologist also collected a
25

series of samples from each stratum that could be used to process radiocarbon samples and for
texture and chemistry analyses. A preliminary series of eight sediment and charcoal samples was
submitted for dating, and the results are integrated in the geomorphic descriptions below and in a
report appendix. Information from the geomorphology and trench monitoring activities helped
determine the placement of hand-dug test units.

STAGE 2: DEEP TEST UNIT MANUAL EXCAVATIONS
Simultaneously with the geomorphic investigations, a series of 10 hand-dug test units was placed
at select exposures in order to sample the occurrence and diversity of materials relative to the
kinds of items observed in mechanical trenching. The contract and permit called for the
placement of most units on trenches yielding artifact evidence from the monitoring exercise, but
at least one test unit was required next to a âculturally sterileâ trench to evaluate the reliability of
the trench monitoring activity. Due to the scarcity of materials observed during trench
monitoring, only 10 test units were excavated. These units, measuring 1-x-1 m (3.3-x-3.3 ft),
were excavated in 10-cm (4 in) arbitrary intervals from surface to a depth of 2.00 m (6.6 ft) or
2.10 m (6.9 ft) if cultural remains were found at the twentieth level. The ground surface served as
the basis for measuring depths of levels. Fill from test units was screened through 0.625
millimeter (mm; .025 in) hardware cloth; all lithic debris, chipped and ground stone tools, bones,
and freshwater mussel shells were collected, but only a sample of 10 Rabdotus snails per level
and burned rock was kept. In many instances, the test units were placed near areas where
artifacts or debris were noted during the monitoring activities. Only when concentrations of
artifacts (burned rock) were encountered were sediments collected for later flotation.
As a result of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) safety standards that
require special stepped excavations if test excavations exceed 5 feet (1.5 m), GMI crews were
required to mechanically strip off a 0.5-m-thick (1.6 ft) safety bench around the tops of all 1-x-1m units targeted for manual excavation before reaching the defined OSHA depth in order to
accommodate safety requirements. The use of sloping sidewalls was rejected as impractical due
to the goals of the excavations. The project geomorphologist was designated as the responsible
party to assess the sediment safety from sidewall collapse. Thus, the test units were initially
excavated to depths of between 0.5 and 1.2 m (1.6 and 3.9 ft). Nails were inserted into the test
unit wall to document the boundaries between levels as subsurface elevation data. The upper
profiles of each unit were drawn and photographed. Then the backhoe mechanically stripped off
a âsafety collarâ of at least 0.5 m (1.6 ft) thick. Crews manually cleaned the rubble from the
holes, and the nail referencing elevation data were used to reestablish the test units. Manual
excavations resumed to depths of 200 or 210 cm (79 or 83 in) bs without requiring OSHAregulated safety shoring or trench-stepping procedures. The field director and the principal
investigator used the results from the various test units to evaluate the number and placement of
occupation zones worthy of testing through formal 9-square- meter (m2) areas.
In addition to the stratigraphic samples collected by the geomorphologist, the field archeologists
collected a continuous set of samples (10-x-10 cm horizontally by 5 cm vertically [4-x-4-x-2 in])
from three columns of sediments from surface to a depth of 2.00 m (6.6 ft) next to Trenches 1, 19,
and 22. These samples provide a continuous record of artifact density of materials such as snails,
etc., that were sampled only during the excavation of the test units. The column samples also
have the potential to provide data on magnetic susceptibility of the deposits and can supplement
color, texture, and chemical samples collected from particular zones by the geomorphologist.
26

Two of the three columns were collected from areas that served as a focus for block excavations,
and the column samples have direct relevance for contributing further information about these
block areas.
The dark sediments of the West Fork paleosol were found in all excavation trenches, and the
enriched organic horizon was generally too dark or bioturbated to permit the recognition of
prehistoric pits or posthole features and perhaps even some stratigraphic unconformities. During
mechanical trenching, several areas contained amorphous charcoal and/or oxidized burned stains
spanning 50 cm (20 in) or more of the profile and often angling at step inclines; these were
regarded as tree burn events and were not treated as cultural features. Based on prior experience
in excavations in the Trinity River alluvium at 41TR174 (Lintz et al. 2004), it was thought that
freshwater mussel shell or bone concentrations might be encountered and these would warrant
feature designation. However, such was not the case at 41TR170. The primary material classes
designated as features were multiple pieces of burned rock in clusters, mounds, or depressions.
Other concentrations of bones and soil discolorations beneath the paleosol had the potential to be
designated as features but were rarely used. Only eight features were designated during the initial
backhoe trenching and excavation of the deep test units. These consist of one area with
concentrated charcoal flecking (Feature 5) and seven burned rock concentrations (Features 1â4,
7â9; Feature 6 was used in later block excavations).
The designation of rock clusters as features afforded greater documentation, and they were
excavated differently from the standard levels. In general, rocks comprising a feature were
exposed in plan view and were profiled. Each was mapped in plan view and profile, and each
feature was photographed. Many rocks were assigned a specimen number, and the top and
bottom elevations of the rocks were recorded. On some maps, the direction of the downward
slope of the rocks was recorded. Initially, when few rocks were treated as features, each rock was
bagged with the number corresponding to the plan view map and returned to the laboratory for
further analysis regarding size, shape, and material type. However, later when large rock features
were encountered, the rocks were documented in the field. Rock sizes were measured in 5-cm (2
in) intervals (<5, 5â10, 10â15, 15â20, 20>, etc.), sorted into size groups and material types
(sandstone, limestone, or other), and weighed as a class grouping. Burned sandstone rocks were
numbered on the site maps and individually collected to provide maximum context data on
specimens for possible lipid residue analysis.
In an effort to recover minute charred plant remains from features, a series of sediment samples
from feature fill was collected. These samples consisted of sediments from one or more bags
each of a 12-liter galvanized bucket. In addition, the presence of rock features also signified the
possibility of an associated occupation surface. Therefore, other sediment samples were collected
from one corner of each level of test units containing a feature during the deep testing and during
the subsequent block excavation phase of investigations. These samples were collected for
waterscreening or flotation to recover minute artifacts that would be missed during conventional
screening and macrobotanical remains for dating and subsistence analysis. Insofar as few of
these samples have been processed to date, it is possible that the frequency of artifact counts
reported in this report may increase, especially since these samples were from layers that likely
represent cultural zones.

27

STAGE 3: MANUAL EXCAVATION OF SMALL BLOCKS
The final phase of fieldwork called for archeologists to establish no fewer than three and no more
than five 9-m2 blocks next to trenches with the highest potential to contain archeologically
exploitable deposits. Due to the paucity of cultural material found through deep testing, only
three blocks were examined during the testing at 41TR170. The principal investigator and project
archeologist chose the locations for the blocks based on the results of trenching and deep test unit
excavations. One main source of information was the tabulation of artifacts (flakes, tools, bones,
shell, burned rock, etc.) on individual level forms maintained during the manual excavation of the
deep test units. These data were supplemented by stratigraphic observations of sediments and the
distribution of features.
The shape of the blocks varied in configuration (i.e., 3-x-3 m, 1-x-9 m, or another layout) based
on the presence of cultural zones, distribution of features, or other considerations, including the
configuration of the stripped overburden above the target excavation area. The results from these
block excavations serve as the basis for assessing the potential for the recovery of horizontally
distributed cultural materials associated with single occupations or repeated occupation over
relatively short time periods.
The scope of work called for the blocks to be excavated in layers no thicker than 40 cm (16 in),
specifically targeting culturally dense occupation zones. Furthermore, the units comprising the
excavation blocks were to be dug in incremental units no larger than 1-x-1 m (3.3-x-3.3 ft) in size
and in levels no thicker than 10 cm (4 in). Identified features might cause deviation in these
standard methods in order to maximize the understanding of the feature context and the
associated materials. The fill overlying the targeted occupation zones was mechanically stripped,
and for targeted zones deeper than 1.5 m (4.9 ft), a larger excavation hole or safety benches were
mechanically stripped around the edge of the block in compliance with OSHA safety
requirements.
The project scope stipulated that blocks be placed next to different trenches unless locations were
not available in five different trenches or some other compelling reason (including absence of
suitable cultural zones) existed to concentrate the blocks in fewer than three locations. Initial
assessment of the artifact recovery identified two areas yielding burned rock features about
100 cm (39 in) deep near Trench 19 along the south edge of the site (Block 1) and massive ashy
deposits with bone preservation and artifacts about 200 cm (79 in) deep at Trench 22 north of the
relic river channel (Block 2).
The mechanical excavation of Trench 19 encountered an unusually high density of burned rock
features. As a means of determining the configuration of the burned rock extent and to help plan
the configuration of Block 1 and maximize the information recovery, a series of supplemental test
trenches (designated AâE) was dug, and the overburden was stripped away to just above the
burned rock in a fairly large area. This led to the recognition of concentrated burned rock over a
sizable area measuring at least 12-x-12 m (39-x-39 ft). Discussions with regional archeologists
ascertained that no comparable density or size of burned rock feature has been documented in the
Trinity River basin (Duane Peter, Dan McGregor, Maynard Cliff, personal communications
2005). The density of features in this area contrasted with the overall very low occurrence of
remains in other parts of the site within the TxDOT ROW. The principal investigator and the
project archeologist decided that the investigation area of Block 1 was too small and inadequate
to assess the size, shape, and diversity, as well as the significance, of large burned rock features in
28

this large area. In order to enhance an understanding of the burned rock density and diversity in
this amorphously stripped area, a 2-x-2-m (6.6-x-6.6 ft) grid oriented to that used for Block 1 was
expanded over the stripped area, and the presence of burned rock was determined by probes
placed at a series of 50-cm (20 in) intervals along the grid (Figure 4). Consultation with TxDOT
archeologists was conducted, and a second noncontiguous manually dug area (Block 3) was
placed near a trench used to delineate the extent of burned rock (subsequently designated as
Trench 29, although this trench was not documented by the project geomorphologist). Thus,
noncontiguous Blocks 1 and 3 were placed over this occupation zone to increase an
understanding of the diversity and complexity of features in this large burned rock area (Figure
5).
In addition to the standard photographic documentation of the feature areas, detailed mapping of
burned rock and other feature information was compiled on plan maps that encompassed multiple
excavation units of any particular block. Such maps were compiled for each level of an
excavation block. The maps also document the spatial clustering of the rocks and help delineate
the limit of discrete features.
As required by the scope of work, test units were excavated in series of 1-x-1-m (3.3-x-3.3 ft)
units that were assigned sequential numbers bearing no coordinates within the blocks. In Block
1, eight full 1-x-1-m (3.3-x-3.3 ft) units were excavated in a 3-x-3-m block configuration adjacent
to deep Test Unit 2. In addition, the northern halves of two other test units were dug to capture
the parts of a burned rock feature exposed in the sidewall of Trench 19. Thus, the test units
comprising Block 1 were designated 2, 11â18, N19 (north half), and N29 (north half). The units
for Block 2, placed north of the relic channel adjacent to Trench 22 and Test Unit 4, were
designated Test Units 20â28, and excavated squares comprising Block 3, in proximity to Block 1,
were designated Test Units 30â38. The distribution of test unit numbers in each of the three
blocks is provided in Figure 6.
Following the scope of work guidelines, all units were excavated in 10-cm (4 in) intervals to a
depth of 40 cm (16 in). However, excavation of Block 2, north of the relic channel, investigated a
thick ashy zone containing abundant small, burned clay daub and charcoal, with bones, shells,
and artifacts, which tended to be about 40 cm (16 in) thick but sloped slightly down toward the
relic river channel. By the end of the excavation of the 40-cm-thick (16 in) occupation zone
(170â210 cm [67â83 in] bs), a number of test units along the south edge of the block still
contained the ashy matrix. Investigators suspected that the matrix might reflect parts of a
prehistoric house structure, but had yet to find conclusive evidence of postholes or hearth features
at the basal contact of the excavation zone. In order to examine the basal contact of the ashy
zone, excavators removed the ashy fill from Level 22 (below 210 cm [83 in] bs) as a natural level
(to the basal contact with the nonashy substrate) from these test units to look for evidence of
structural features; no evidence of architectural features was found.
Features excavated during Stage 3 were treated in the same manner as in the second stage of
fieldwork. Features were exposed in plan view and cross-sectioned. A series of large-scale block
maps was developed to show the spatial occurrence of features. At times, the surface slope of the
rocks was indicated. Many rocks were assigned specific numbers on the base maps, and these
were point-plotted with top and bottom elevations and collected for further studies; special
emphasis was placed on saving sandstone rocks for possible lipid analysis. Several liters of
feature sediment were collected for flotation and waterscreening. Specific feature forms were
completed, and the features were photographed. When high densities of burned rock were

encountered, the process of recording number, size grade, material type, and weight was
completed in the field, and the rocks were left onsite. Altogether, five features each were
documented in nearby Blocks 1 and 3 at the south end of the site, and three features were
recorded in Block 2, located north of the relic channel (Table 3).
Upon completion of the excavation of the three blocks, all excavation units were mechanically
backfilled. No further efforts to dig trenches to discern limits of the ash features in Block 2 were
authorized or undertaken. The procedures used to backfill the site involved the placement of
black plastic sheeting along the walls of the three excavation blocks and addition of about 30 cm
(12 in) of backfill over the excavation area. Then, orange plastic trench protective webbing was

placed over the excavation area as a warning marker to delineate the locations of the entire
mechanically stripped areas that contained three excavation blocks. Should additional
excavations be required in these areas, the webbing was to signal the approach of the target
excavation areas, and the black plastic wrapping the walls of the 40-cm-block (16 in) limits
should serve as an indication of where the controlled excavations stopped. After mechanical
backfilling, the ground surface was restored to pre-excavation grade.

STAGE 4: INITIAL PROCESSING AND PREPARATION OF AN INTERIM REPORT
Simultaneously with fieldwork, laboratory staff began the process of cleaning and sorting the
artifacts obtained from the excavations. The individually collected artifacts were washed and
dried, then sorted and counted by material class within discrete bags. The cleaned artifacts were
not labeled with site numbers, but maintained in bags assigned discrete numbers for each artifact
provenience. The artifact counts for items such as bone and shell reflect the number of
fragmentary specimens present and do not reflect the minimum number of individuals or
minimum number of elements; thus, if one bone was broken into a dozen pieces, the entry
recorded a dozen items of bone from the provenience lot. These data were used to establish an
Access database that lists the Field Specimen (FS) number, the provenience of materials, the
rough counts of artifacts, and the general artifact classes from the project. Coordination with the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), which will ultimately curate the collections
from 41TR170, indicates that catalog lot numbers for the testing phase of the project should start
with #76 and photographic prints should start with #58, so that the artifact processing does not
duplicate the lot numbers assigned during the survey phase from the site.
All photographs from the project have been processed, and the field photographic logs have been
entered into an electronic database. Site records were organized and grouped by test units in file
folders and notebooks. In addition, GPS data on backhoe trench, test units, and excavation block
locations were plotted, rectified, and superimposed over aerial photographs that also depict the
proposed ROW edge as published in the environmental assessment report posted on the TxDOT
web site. Other graphics were developed from select field maps in both electronic and paper
formats.
No detailed or formal analysis of the artifacts was undertaken for preparation of the initial interim
report. However, the chipped stone debris was examined to identify the approximate number and
general kinds of stone tools in the assemblage. Similar examinations were conducted on historic
artifacts and ground stone tools. Bones and shell were checked to ascertain whether seemingly
high counts of remains were real or the result of excavation damage.
Only 12 of the 149 collected sediment samples from feature and nonfeature (test unit) contexts
were initially processed by GMI staff in order to identify the presence of organic material
preservation. A 5-liter (5.3 quarts [qt]) subsample of each sediment bag was extracted for
flotation recovery using 0.5-mm (.02 in) and 6.25-mm (.25 in) geological sieves to capture very
fine and coarse particles. The remainder of the sample was processed using waterscreening
methods through a 6.25-mm (.25 in) screen and a pressure hose in order to retrieve artifacts
comparable to that from the dry screening methods used in the field. The flotation was designed
to obtain a minimally damaged assemblage of small charred remains from the specific
provenience context. The heavy fraction component was also saved and dried. Only a cursory
examination of these samples to look for the existence of organic remains was made during
development of the initial interim report.
34

Later, 15 other sediment samples were sent to Dr. Phil Dering for flotation recovery and
macrobotanical identification. These samples ranged from 3 to 5 liters (3.2â5.3 qt) each, but the
submittal of multiple samples from the same feature was designed to examine the recovery of
macrobotanical remains from up to 10-liters (11 qt) of sediments from a single feature. Some of
the identified charred botanical remains were then submitted for radiocarbon dating of specific
features.
Eight bulk sediment and carbon samples collected by the geomorphologist were prepared and
submitted through TxDOT ENV for radiocarbon dating to define the geomorphic context of the
site. These samples were explicitly collected near stratigraphic boundary zones to provide
information about the changing depositional regimes on site. During later stages of the analysis,
eight other macrobotanical samples were submitted through TxDOT ENV in order to
chronometrically date the cultural features and occupations from the three target excavation
blocks.
The interim report was based primarily on information derived from the Access database. After
data were entered, the database entries were proofed for typographical accuracies. Some
rechecking of data occurred during this period. Specific material classes derived from this project
consist of one continuous sediment column sample of alluvial terrace sediments and other
sediment samples from features and occupation surfaces for flotation and fine screening. Also
collected were burned sandstone samples for lipid studies, other burned rocks from feature and
nonfeature contexts, organic/charcoal samples, burned clay or daub samples, lithic debris and
lithic tools, ground stone tools, bones, freshwater mussel shells, land snails, and historic artifacts.

STAGE 5: SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING FOR THE REVISED INTERIM REPORT
Upon review of the initial interim report, TxDOT ENV staff directed GMI to conduct additional
laboratory studies in order to further document the age of the important cultural components and
further document the preservation conditions for the organic remains from the site. Additional
literature review was also requested in order to provide a context for making recommendations
and guiding further work if the site were to be deemed eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and
future investigations were warranted. Information from these studies was to be integrated into the
body of the report.
The freshwater mussel shells and bones were examined for this stage of investigation. For the
freshwater shells, a count was made of the umbos or hinge segments as a means of quantifying
the frequency of the number of individual specimens (NISP), as opposed to the raw count of total
fragments or number of specimens (NSP) (Appendix H). This distinction becomes critical since
freshwater mussel shells tend to readily fragment into many pieces, which provides a very
misleading count of individuals.
One significant data gap in the initial interim report involved ascertaining the preservation of
macrobotanical remains, especially from feature contexts. Since charred macrobotanical remains
are rarely reported from sites in the Trinity River basin, such data have tremendous potential to
provide information about prehistoric subsistence activities or regional habitat conditions.
Accordingly, 15 sediment samples were selected from feature and nonfeature contexts from the
three main excavation blocks and sent to Dr. Phil Dering. A consistent 5-liter (5.3 qt) sample of
matrix from each feature was processed using a flotation device, and both the light and heavy
35

fractions of these samples were identified. The macrobotanical data are integrated into this report
and provided as an appendix at the end of the report. Similarly, Dr. Mary Malainey was sent a
single burned rock from two features in each of the three blocks for the extraction and general
identification of prehistoric lipid residues from the outside of the heated stones. Her results based
on these six lipid samples are also summarized in the report and provided as an appendix to this
report. In addition, a series of eight identified macrobotanical/charred wood samples from direct
feature contexts as identified by Dr. Dering was submitted to Beta Analytic Radiocarbon Dating
Laboratory (Beta Analytic) to chronometrically date the cultural features found in the three
excavation blocks at the site. These results are also integrated into the body of the final report
and included as an appendix. Note that the specific samples sent to outside consultants are
referenced in this report by the original FS number, the TARL catalog lot number, and
sometimes, with the lipid samples, a specific rock number. This cross-referencing ensures a
cross-referenced procedure that maximizes the retention of provenience data.
Finally, in order to understand the importance of the burned rock features at 41TR170, a literature
review was conducted to determine the prevalence of burned rock features in the region, as well
as to provide some baseline data about the uniqueness of the kinds of burned rock features present
at the site. The impression gained from many archeologists working in the Dallas-Fort Worth
region is that, unlike Central Texas, burned rock features are relatively rare or, when encountered,
tend to be small. Insofar as a relatively high density of burned rock features was found at specific
settings at 41TR170, the popular perception was that the situation was a rather rare event.
However, since the site is along the Clear Fork of the Trinity River and is only some 8 km (5 mi)
from the Brazos River drainage divide, any regional summary must include data from both the
upper Trinity and middle Brazos river basins.
In order to collect information about the occurrence of burned rock features in the region, an 80km (50-mile) radius around 41TR170 was selected as a target area. Information on isolated and
feature-based burned rock from all 15 counties within this target radius was included in the study
area. Data from the Trinity River basin were derived for Wise, Denton, Collin, Tarrant, Dallas,
Ellis, and portions of Jack, Parker, Johnson, and Hill counties. Data from the Brazos River basin
were derived for Palo Pinto, Erath, Hood, Somervell, Bosque, and portions of Jack, Parker,
Johnson, and Hill counties. The initial sources for data about burned rock occurrences and
feature types were the electronic Texas sites atlas maintained by the THC and TARL.
Refinements in the nature of sites in the region were obtained by consulting regional overview
studies. The results are presented in Chapter 6.

STAGE 6: DETAILED ANALYSES AND FINAL REPORT PREPARATION
The final stage of investigation consisted of detailed analyses and the preparation of a final report.
The tasks included in this phase of investigation include geomorphological analysis, inventory,
screening and discard, detailed lithic and faunal analyses, and the preparation of a draft and final
report, as well as the preparation of materials for curation. Due to the recovery of little to no
macrobotanical remains, the washing and inventory of all materials collected during archeological
testing included screening all of the sediment samples. All but one of the column samples taken
during the testing phase were screened as well. One column sample from Trench 19 was retained
for curation.

36

Detailed geomorphological analyses include textural and chemical analyses of the geomorphic
sediment samples collected during testing to better document the various depositional units in the
Clear Fork terrace.
These analyses will contribute important information about the
paleoenvironmental sequence of the region since they are associated with dated sediments. The
proposed analyses consist of the following: granulometric analyses of sand (1-phi), silt, clay,
organic matter, and carbonates; and stable carbon isotope analysis of the organic matter from
Trenches 6 and 14.

Laboratory Methods and Artifact Analysis
Initially, all artifacts were cleaned and placed in 4-mil plastic bags. Artifacts were rough-sorted
into different bags based on material and artifact type within provenience. These bags, in turn,
were placed in fresh 4-mil level bags, and each bag was labeled on the outside with its
provenience with permanent marker. Information on the outside of bags included project
number, site number, test unit number, level number and depth, collectorâs initials, and date.
All artifact analyses were conducted by the principal investigator, qualified project archeologists,
and/or outside consultants demonstrating the necessary expertise. Laboratory technicians assisted
in analyses.

Lithic Artifact Analysis
The goals of the lithic analysis were to provide information about site function, technology and
production, lithic source procurement (exchange/interaction), and cultural affiliation based on the
presence of diagnostic chipped stone tool types. In order to address these diverse issues, stone
materials were initially separated into five main classes: (1) chipped stone tools, (2) chipped
stone debitage, (3) cores, (4) ground, pecked, and battered stone artifacts, and (5) unworked
lithics (fire-cracked/burned rock and manuports).
All artifacts were examined macroscopically, or occasionally with a 15X hand lens, to search for
signs of use and wear. Only stone pieces with formal retouch, consistent incidental flake scars, or
formal shaping were classified as tools; other materials were classified as manufacturing
debitage, cores, or nonchipped-stone items. Without the use of a high-power microscope, it is
difficult to differentiate purposeful edge modification from edge damage that occurs as a result of
use or postdepositional disturbance.
Chipped stone lithic materials (tools, debitage, and cores) were sorted by class or implement type,
stone tool material type (siltstone, chert, etc.), condition (proximal, medial, distal, indeterminate),
percent of cortex present (100 percent, primary; 1â99 percent, secondary; or 0 percent, tertiary),
size, and evidence of heat treatment as indicated by potlid, crazing, or discoloration. Counts and
weights were collected for each sorted group.
Lithic material types were identified based on attributes of texture, color, luster, and rock
classification. Many of the cherts were obviously river gravels from the San Antonio River.
River gravels tended to have rounded edges and were stained to a yellow-brown color. Similarly,
instances of thermal alteration were noted by the occurrence of heat treatment or damage as
indicated by potlidded surfaces, crazing, or reddish discoloration.
37

The primary distinction for chipped stone is between tools, which include any flaked stone
artifacts that exhibit either use-wear or purposeful modification, and debitage, which is
manufacturing debris, or flakes, that does not show any macroscopically obvious signs of retouch
or edge damage. Chipped stone tools, at a minimum, include bifaces, projectile points, flake
tools, and unifaces. By definition, a biface is any flaked stone tool that has substantially modified
ventral and dorsal surfaces; bifacial flaking is not limited to the edge of the artifact. Relatively
unrefined bifaces may be modified over less than 50 percent of either or both faces, but all later
stage bifaces must be modified over at least 50 percent of both dorsal and ventral faces. A
projectile point is (usually) a finished bifacial tool that appears to have been hafted on a spear,
dart, or arrow and whose main function appears to have been penetrating the hide of prey. Any
finished (i.e., finely worked) biface, regardless of size, with a formal sharpened tip or evidence of
hafting is considered a projectile point. Some âunifacialâ projectile points that do not fulfill the
entire biface definition may still be considered projectile points because of their sharp tips and
evidence of preparation for hafting.
Flake tools are those flakes that show purposeful retouch to one or more edges and include the
forms that are traditionally known as side scrapers, end scrapers, spokeshaves, and other lessrefined forms. They are distinct from edge-modified flakes, which are flakes whose edges have
been altered only through use or postdepositional damage. Without the use of a high-power
microscope, it is difficult to differentiate between purposeful edge modification and edge damage
that occurs as a result of use or postdepositional disturbance. Flakes with modified edges are
only considered flake tools if the flake scars along the edge of the piece âinvadeâ either the dorsal
or ventral face of the tool more than 2 mm. Although somewhat arbitrary, this is a standard
measurement used in other studies. The distinction between flake tools and edge-modified flakes
helps distinguish those artifacts in which a significant amount of effort was invested in their
shaping from those that were used with less refinement.
Cores (also known as âobjective piecesâ) are pieces of flaked stone used primarily as sources for
flakes that were further reduced/manufactured into tools; occasionally, however, the core itself
was used as a core/cobble tool. Cores are found in a variety of forms, but amorphous cores with
multiple platforms and little deliberate shaping are probably the most common. Other forms
include bipolar cores, which are created through use of a hammer and anvil, and unidirectional
cores, which have a single platform.

Chipped Stone Tool
Chipped stone artifacts with formal symmetrical or asymmetrical shaping or exhibiting
systematic unifacial or bifacial flake scars were regarded as tools, separate and distinct from cores
or debitage. Chipped stone tools were separated into three classes: (1) projectile points or
portions of projectile points (established as a distinct category because many are time and
culturally diagnostic), (2) bifacial implements, and (3) unifacial implements. The size of
individual pieces was measured using spreading calipers to the nearest tenth of a millimeter.
Items were counted and weighed to the nearest tenth of a gram. Other observations included the
amount of extant cortex, stone material type, and condition. Each tool was counted and specific
attributes recorded.

38

Projectile points were classified as haftable bifaces with a defined base, stem, and shoulders. The
distinction between dart (large) and arrow (small) points was based on overall size. If sufficient
amount of the point was present, it was compared to established named types (Turner and Hester
1999). These names form the basis for ascertaining the cultural affiliations and time periods
present. In addition, measurements were taken for the maximum overall size, and the length and
width of the stem element.
Projectile points are likely to be the only reliable indicators of relative site age during fieldwork
and as such are of critical importance to the chronological research domain. Application of
comparative type-variety analysis provides both refined temporal data and sociocultural group
relationships in cases where specific varieties of a type have complementary distributions
interpretable as sociocultural group boundaries. Identification of nonlocal raw material sources
for projectile points, and their potentially derived thinning flakes, provides data on the locations
of previously visited localities. Material source identification thus helps reconstruct part of any
seasonal round of movement, trade, and/or areas exploited by extractive teams operating from the
same base camp(s) as those present at the study area (Brown and Vierra 1983; Nance 1987;
Stafford 1991, 1994). The utility of projectile point data is largely dependent on the overall
sample size and the relative frequency of projectile points.
Bifacial implements refer to nonprojectile point implements. If a generalized biface, rather than
an elaborate form, was represented, the specimen was classified according to the Callahan biface
reduction or manufacturing stages (Callahan 1979). Callahanâs Stage 1 was not used, since it
refers to an unmodified and unshaped blank suitable for making a biface. The following are
summaries of Callahanâs Biface Stages 2 through 5:
â¢ Stage 2 biface, also called a rough-out, generally has little emphasis on shape reduction or
thinning, but instead has a few large flake scars removed to create an initial bifacial
working edge around the circumference of the objective piece. These crude bifaces tend to
be thick relative to width (a width-to-thickness ratio ranging from 2:1 to 3:1) and have very
sinuous edges and no emphasis on reduction in the middle of the biface.
â¢ Stage 3 biface, also called primary preform, exhibits initial stages of thinning and shaping.
These specimens show the initial efforts to drive flakes entirely across the face of the
implements and have lenticular cross sections and a centered biconvex edge. They tend to
be somewhat thinner (width-to-thickness ratio ranging from 3:1 to 4:1) and have the
beginning of a generalized geometric shape and slightly less sinuous edges.
â¢ Stage 4 biface, also called secondary preform, demonstrates a focus on creating a
symmetrical outline with a flattened, lenticular cross section and straighter, slightly
sinuous, centered, bi-convex edges. The width-to-thickness ratio ranges from 4:1 to 5:1.
â¢ Stage 5 biface, also called final or thinned preform, is symmetrical, with a relatively
parallel-sided outline reminiscent of the final tool shape. These bifaces have a flattened,
lenticular cross section and straight, nonsinuous edges. The width-to-thickness crosssection ratio ranges from roughly 5:1 to as thin as 10:1.

Some bifacial implements were produced as other formal tools and were identified based on
specialized shape and functional requirements. Bifacial implements were classified by function,
such as knife, perforator/drill, graver, etc., or by Callahan production stage. Typology and
terminology generally followed that provided by Turner and Hester (1999).
Unifacial tools referred to formally and informally shaped implements with edge modification
and retouch solely on one face. Formal, shaped unifaces can include scrapers, Albany unifaces,
etc. Scrapers were subdivided into categories of end scrapers, side scrapers, end/side scrapers,
and scrapers with spurs based on the location of modification on the implement. Informally
shaped unifaces included modified flakes, gravers, and notch/spokeshaves. Note that the term
modified flake is used to describe visible edge modifications on edge-modified pieces rather than
the term utilized flake, which is often based on judgmental opinion on a presumed cause of edge
alteration.
Analysis of flake tools can address the technological activities research domain and, if specific
types of tasks can be associated with specific locations, also the subsistence patterns domain.
Examination of apparent working edges of flake tools attempted to provide insight into this area
by identification of probable uses producing the observed wear characteristics, such as scraper
use on hides vs. wood, when possible.

Chipped Stone Debitage
Debitage analysis was undertaken on each of the assemblages collected during the current project.
Discarded remains from chipped stone tool manufacture were assigned to the category of chipped
stone debitage. Material in this class was sorted into subgroups of flakes (core, biface thinning,
blades, notching flakes, tool rejuvenation, and indeterminate fragments), shatter, or potlids. The
focus of this analysis was to determine the types of lithic technologies represented at each site and
to delineate the specific reduction stage or tool use that occurred. Analysis focused on three
factors: (1) material type, (2) cortical stage of decortication flakes, and (3) reduction stage of
postdecortication flakes. The cortical and reduction stages are defined as follows:
CORTICAL STAGE
Primary
Secondary
Tertiary

CRITERIA
99 % or more cortex on dorsal surface
1â99 % cortex on dorsal surface
No cortex on dorsal surface; includes interior flakes and biface thinning flakes

REDUCTION STAGE CRITERIA
Shatter
Dorsal and ventral surfaces cannot be identified; can occur at any stage
Core/Decortication Flake:
Early Core
Primary flake with planar platform and less than 3 dorsal ridges
Late Core
Primary or secondary flake with planar platform and 3 or more dorsal ridges
Interior Flake

Tertiary flake with planar platform

Biface Thinning Flake:
Early Biface
Secondary or tertiary flake with moderate longitudinal curvature, moderately
steep platform, and less than 3 dorsal ridges
Late Biface
Tertiary flake with moderate to strong longitudinal curvature, moderately steep to
steep platform, and 3 or more dorsal ridges

40

Pressure Retouch Elongated or teardrop-shaped flake, not more than 5 mm in thickness with nippleshaped platform

All debitage was sorted into the following size ranges:
< 6.4 mm (< Â¼ in)
6.4 to 12.7 mm (Â¼ to Â½ in)
12.7 to 19.0 mm (Â½ to Â¾ in)
19.0 to 25.4 mm (Â¾ to 1 in)
25.4 to 38.1 mm (1 to 1Â½ in)
38.1 to 50.8 mm (1Â½ to 2 in)
> 50.8 mm (> 2 in)
Source stone material type for all debitage was identified. Other recorded attributes included the
amount of cortex present on the dorsal surface (100 percent, 1â99 percent, 0 percent, platform
only, indeterminate) and presence/absence of heat treatment or thermal damage (none, discolored,
potlidded, crazed, curved thermal spall).
âFlakeâ was defined as a sharp piece of stone with defined dorsal and ventral surfaces and, if the
platform was present, a series of attributes that delineate the striking point that removed the flake
from the core. In contrast to flakes, which can be oriented, the term âshatterâ was applied to
angular blocky chunks of stone, with or without cortex, that do not exhibit ripple marks or other
indications that permit orientation of the specimen.
Whole and proximal flake portions that retain the striking platforms were subdivided into core or
biface thinning flakes. The distinction was not based on a single attribute, but rather on an
impression of a cluster of attributes. Core flakes tend to be thick, with salient bulbs, steep
platform-to-dorsal surface angle, and no ridge crests across their platforms. In contrast, biface
thinning flakes tend to be thin, with acute platform-to-dorsal surface angle, one or more ridges on
the platform surface, and occasionally a lipped surface. The classification of core and biface
thinning flakes indicate the range of reduction present onsite. Medial and distal flake fragments
lacking a platform were classified as indeterminate.
Blades are special kinds of flakes that typically are twice as long as wide, but they also refer to a
reduction strategy and the use of specific kinds of cores. Notching flakes are a relatively rare
kind of small flake with a concave-convex platform. They are produced during the attempt to add
notches to projectile points during initial manufacture. Tool rejuvenation flakes reflect a special
kind of knapping in which a flake was struck along the margin of the working blade in order to
remove a series of overhanging resharpening flake scars (Shafer 1970). Typically, they are
narrow curving flakes that have distinctive flake scars along the dorsal ridge. The distinctive
scars along the dorsal ridge can either be unifacial scars, many with step or hinge scars, or
bifacial flake removals with comparable damage.

Core
Cores refer to raw nodules or reduced objective pieces that are used to make flakes to be
fashioned into tools, or that represent the early reduction stages of a cobble itself on its way to
becoming a cobble/core tool. No cores were recovered from site 41TR170.

Ground Stone and Cobble Artifact
Ground stone tools consist of nonsiliceous/noncutting tools such as milling stones and hand
stones, mortars and pestles, and axes/adzes/chisels. Other forms include pitted anvil stones, often
with grinding wear on the faces and hammerstone usage on the edges, and shaft abraders
identified by grooves worn in abrasive stone such as sandstone. Analysis of size and wear
attributes of the ground stone artifacts potentially addressed the subsistence pattern, community
structure, and technological activities research domains.

Unworked Lithics
This category included unworked lithics associated with human occupation such as fire-cracked
rock, burned rock, and griddle stones that were used but not formally flaked or shaped
(manuports, unaltered, nonindigenous stones brought onsite by the occupants, is also classified as
unworked lithics). Burned rock was the main component remaining in cooking and heating
features at this site. Burned rock recovered from test unit levels was weighed separately from
rock recovered from feature contexts. Most of the burned rock was recorded by lithic material,
weight, rough size, and description in the field and not collected.
Burned rock samples were collected for lipid analysis from several features. In addition, a great
deal of burned rock was collected from particular features during excavation as well as included
inadvertently as a part of the sediment samples. All of the rock collected was counted and
weighed in the laboratory and was included with the field counts of burned rock in the excavation
results before being discarded.

Faunal Analysis
Specimens are assigned to class, order, suborder, family, genus, and species according to their
identifiability. Size classes are used to describe remains that bear no diagnostic features but are
similar in size and shape to portions from a particular element from a species; the class âmedium
ungulateâ is less diagnostic than âdeer sizeâ and tends to comprise long-bone midshaft fragments.
Specimens assigned to medium ungulate are not included in the systematic paleontology. Given
the low density of elements from the axial skeleton and the taxonomic overlap in morphological
characteristics of rib fragments in particular, several fragments are considered âunidentified.â
When identifications of such elements are possible (including long-bone shaft fragments), they
are offered in terms of size class, which is a conservative approach. A discussion of taphonomy
of the fauna is covered. Freshwater bivalve remains are identified through comparison to modern
specimens from the region and through use of published criteria. Specimens were counted using
two quantitative units: NSP (number of specimens) and NISP (number of identified specimens)
(Lyman 1994).
Fragmentary non-umbo freshwater mussel shells were discarded; umbos and fragments with
evidence of hinges were retained. Approximately 2,000 snail shells (mostly Rabdotus and
Helicina) were collected. Of these, 10 were retained for curation and the potential of future
studies that may investigate sediment integrity via epimerization studies. The remainder of the
snail shells were counted and discarded.

42

Baked Clay Analysis
Baked clay (daub and burned clay) specimens are distinguished from vessel sherds by several
indicators. Those pieces exhibiting impressions of vegetal fibers or other vegetal remains are
indicative of architectural daub from wattle-and-daub structures. If, however, no impressions are
present, the fragments are considered to be unimpressed burned clay, the nondiagnostic clay
fragments of unknown origin that could represent the residue of hearths or other open-firing
activities, the remains of burned clay cooking balls, or even possibly indistinguishable fragments
of architectural daub. Baked clay specimens collected in the field were weighed, after
determination of whether each piece was daub or burned clay.

Curation
All artifacts were catalogued, labeled, and bagged in compliance with standards, procedures, and
guidelines set forth in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 79, âCuration of Federally Owned
and Administered Archeological Collections.â All documentation and photographic records
compiled during the investigations were catalogued in compliance with these standards. At the
termination of this project, all cultural material and documentation generated during this
investigation will be curated at TARL, the University of Texas, in accordance with TARL
requirements.

CHAPTER 4
GEOMORPHOLOGICAL RESULTS

Archeological site 41TR170 occurs on an abandoned or stranded floodplain terrace of the Clear
Fork of the Trinity River in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas. An artificial channel of the Clear
Fork was cut down more than 4 m into Cretaceous limestone during channelization, leaving the
older natural channel and its floodplain terrace high and dry. The older channel is visible on the
1981 USGS Benbrook 7.5 minute quadrangle map. Site 41TR170 is located along a southturning bend of the old channel in the middle of the alluvial valley.
HOLOCENE STRATIGRAPHY
The valley fill deposits at site 41TR170 are not exposed in outcrops but instead have been
inspected in a series of 28 2-m-deep backhoe trenches located throughout the site on both the
north and south side of the old natural channel of the Clear Fork (stratigraphic sections in
Appendix I). The overall stratigraphy shown in the trenches is fairly uniform from exposure to
exposure and reflects the late Holocene floodplain environment of the Clear Fork at this locality
(Figure 7). The dominant geologic feature of the floodplain is the West Fork paleosol. Its
ubiquitous presence serves as a marker for correlation of archeological remains and features
within the floodplain stratigraphic sequence.
Pre-Paleosol Sediments
Based on information from the basal sediments observed in trenches at site 41TR170, three prepaleosol units are present (oldest to youngest): cemented gravels (late Pleistocene), yellow clay
(late Holocene), and gray clay (late Holocene).
Cemented Gravels
Carbonate-cemented, rounded limestone gravels occur at the base of Trenches 18 and 19; only the
upper 30 cm of the gravel deposit are exposed. The gravels have a yellowish clay matrix. The
gravels exhibit a moderate amount of sorting. Individual gravels are generally less than 20 mm in
diameter although rare individual clasts are larger than 40 mm in diameter. The individual
limestone clasts are white with a weak yellowish weathering rind about 2 mm thick.

the dark material at the floor of the trench is clay that has been cleaned off of the exposure; yellow tags mark
unit boundaries; 1-m scale with 10-cm intervals.

Carbonate coats on the gravels are thin, less than 0.5 mm in thickness. Carbonate cementation of
the gravels occurs in subrounded lenses or masses; some gravel clasts are not cemented together.
The secondary carbonate cementation is likely related to former higher water table positions in
the alluvial valley during the late Pleistocene. The gravels probably represent the top edge of a
late Pleistocene buried terrace deposit. An extensive Pleistocene terrace outcrops above the
Holocene floodplain along the Clear Fork valley and is previously mapped (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1972). The gravels may correlate with the late Wisconsinan Carrollton alluvium
beneath a buried eroded margin of the Denton Creek terrace complex (Ferring 1990).
46

Yellow Clay
The yellow clay unit (yellowish brown, 10YR 5/6) is about 1 m thick, is exposed in only
Trenches 18 and 19, and rests directly on cemented gravels with which it has a sharp basal
contact. It is silty and sandy, massive with no bedding, calcareous with faint carbonate filaments
in the lower 30 cm, and contains occasional small isolated rounded limestone pebbles. Bulk
sediment from the lower 12 cm of the yellowish brown clay has a conventional radiocarbon age
of 2,910 Â± 60 14C years B.P., the earliest radiocarbon age from site 41TR170.
The yellow clay may have been more extensive in the late Holocene local valley fill but now is
eroded and missing from the base of most trenches, although remnants of it may occur at greater
depth. Based on the radiocarbon ages of the yellow clay and overlying gray clay, the episode of
erosion occurred ca. 2,500 14C years B.P. There is an outside possibility that the yellow clay is a
weathered component of the gravel deposit and that its radiocarbon age is spurious. However, the
clay-gravel basal contact is an erosional unconformity, and the bulk sediment was pretreated to
remove carbonates before dating. Otherwise, stratigraphic position, the geography, and the
radiocarbon age are consistent within the context of the small area studied at 41TR170.
At Trenches 18 and 19, a 16â26-cm-thick zone of limestone gravels overlies the yellow clay. The
clay-gravel contact is sharp and represents the erosional episode ca. 2,500 14C years B.P. after
which the gravels were deposited. The gray clay unit is missing at Trenches 18 and 19, never
deposited in this small area, and the West Fork paleosol occurs directly on the thin zone of
gravels.

Gray Clay
The basal alluvial sediment directly beneath the West Fork paleosol and exposed in most of the
trenches at site 41TR170 is grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clayey silt and very fine sand. The
alluvium is massive with no primary bedding features preserved. It is strongly calcareous and
commonly includes numerous carbonate filaments along small root traces but does not include
carbonate nodules. The carbonate filaments become less abundant in the upper part of the unit
where it grades into the overlying paleosol; the secondary carbonate filaments are related to
groundwater rather than downward-percolating water from precipitation.
The gray clay and the West Fork paleosol represent a single continuously deposited body of
alluvium without a discernible unconformity. The primary difference between the two is
sedimentation rate, the paleosol accumulating more slowly than the gray clay.
Two accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon ages on isolated detrital charcoal from
this unit are 2,360 Â± 40 and 1,630 Â± 40 14C years B.P.; the latter age may be a few hundred years
too young. Although not directly observed, an erosional unconformity occurs between the older
yellow and the younger gray clay; to reiterate, the episode of erosion occurred about 2,500 14C
years B.P.

47

Floodplain Paleo-Topography and Cumulic Soil Development
The yellow clay and gray clay units together form a surface on which the West Fork paleosol
developed. The pre-paleosol floodplain surface topography in the study area is not flat; it has a
relief of 93 cm (assuming the modern surface as the elevational datum; precise total station or
high resolution GPS data are not available). Prior to the overbank or valley-wide flooding that
produced the slowly accumulating paleosol, there were areas of topographic high as well as
adjacent areas of topographic low, probably a result of erosion and floodplain scouring about
2,500 years ago. The locality of Trenches 18 and 19 was a topographic high, the deposits at that
place composed of an erosional remnant of the yellow clay and underlying cemented-gravel units.
During flooding events on the paleofloodplain, low areas would be flooded more frequently and,
consequently, the cumulic West Fork paleosol will have accumulated first in these low areas and
the resulting paleosol will be comparatively thick. Specifically, the early stage of cumulic soil
development as illustrated by the 140-cm-thick paleosol in Trench 23 began by about 2,300 Â± 50
14
C years B.P. (Figure 8). Topographic high areas have a cumulic paleosol that is less thick and
that may have begun forming a few hundred years after paleosol accumulation in low areas.

West Fork Paleosol
The West Fork paleosol was named from floodplain bank exposures along the West Fork of the
Trinity River, central Tarrant County, Texas (Ferring 1986:93). Subsequent studies along the
Elm Fork of the Trinity River show that the West Fork paleosol is a prominent basin-wide soilgeomorphic feature (Ferring 1987:40). In the present investigation at site 41TR170 on the Clear
Fork, the paleosol is also present and is a cumulic over-thickened A horizon soil, formed by slow
fluvial aggradation on the floodplain over a comparatively long period of time. The cumulic soil
is largely devoid of pedogenic features, such as clay skins or clay accumulation, blocky or ped
structure, or secondary carbonates. The cumulic soil is called a âpaleosolâ instead of âsoilâ in
this investigation. A paleosol is a soil that formed in the past under conditions of the physical
landscape, geomorphology, vegetation, hydrology, and climate that no longer occur at that
location, a situation that certainly applies specifically in this case along Clear Fork as well as
throughout the Trinity River drainage basin and elsewhere in the southcentral United States. In
other words, the environmental conditions that produced the West Fork paleosol no longer exist.
48

The West Fork paleosol at site 41TR170 is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clayey silt and very
fine sand; its dark color distinguishes it from older and younger alluvium (Table 4). The
thickness of the paleosol ranges from 59 cm (Trench 12) to 152 cm (Trench 21) and averages
about 85 cm (these numbers excluded paleosol localities where historic activity may have
resulted in the removal of the top part of the old soil; Trenches 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20). The
fluvial sediments that make up the paleosol are all fine-grained sands, silt, and clay derived from
Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, mostly limestone, shales, marls, and sandstone, that
outcrop in the Clear Fork drainage. The paleosol itself formed by very slow aggradation on the
Clear Fork floodplain, an average sedimentation rate of perhaps no more than 1 mm per year.
The soil is massive, lacking any evidence of primary bedding. The slow sedimentation rate
coupled with bioturbation by burrowing insects, snails, and earthworms resulted in the
obliteration of micro-sedimentary layers. To reiterate, the paleosol does not exhibit secondary
pedogenic features at this locality.

Carbonates
The paleosol sediments are all highly calcareous, ranging from 32 to 41 percent and probably
representing calcite particles derived from limestone and marl bedrock in the watershed. Visible
secondary carbonates in the form of filaments along root traces are rare in the sediment column of
the paleosol but are generally abundant in the lower 15 cm of the paleosol and especially in the
underlying alluvium. These secondary carbonates are probably derived from dissolution of
detrital calcite clasts in the fine sediment and transported by groundwater in the more permeable
alluvium beneath the less permeable clayey paleosol. Given the overall abundance of carbonates
and the youthfulness of the paleosol, it would otherwise be difficult to account for the presence of
secondary carbonates only at depths of 70 cm or more and the absence of filaments in the upper
70 cm of the paleosol. The carbonates at the base of the paleosol are not related to soil-forming
processes but instead are a byproduct of water uptake and respiration by rootlets.

Paleosol Chronology and Correlation
A few radiocarbon ages from site 41TR170 indicate that the paleosol began to accumulate by
about 2,300 Â± 50 14C years B.P. and that paleosol accumulation ended after 1,240 Â± 40 14C years

B.P. but perhaps continuing as late as 860 Â± 70 C years B.P. Thus, the West Fork paleosol
14
ranges from about 2,300 to roughly 1,000 C years B.P.; additional radiocarbon ages would help
refine the chronology.
A similar cumulic paleosol is reported from late Holocene floodplains throughout the Southern
Plains. Its significance was first recognized and documented by Hall (1977, 1978, 1979, 1982,
1988; Hall and Lintz 1984) where it is known as the Copan paleosol, named for the community of
Copan, Washington Company, northeastern Oklahoma. Subsequently, the equivalent paleosol
was recognized in Texas where it has been called the Navarro paleosol (Bruseth et al. 1987), Asa
soil (Waters and Nordt 1995), and the West Fork paleosol (Ferring 1986). The Copan paleosol
and its geomorphology, geochronology, and paleoecology, as well as its nomenclatural
equivalents, were reviewed by Hall (1990).

Absence of Evidence for Channel Cutting 1,000 Years Ago
Many of the late Holocene alluvial sequences reported from the Southern Plains, beginning with
early studies in Oklahoma and including more recent investigations in Texas, are dominated by
the cumulic A horizon Copan paleosol and its equivalent. The formation of this paleosol is
terminated by down-cutting of floodplains in river basin after river basin across the broad
subcontinent region about 1,000 14C years B.P. (Blum and Valastro 1994; Hall 1990). Alluvial
sequences that exhibit 1,000-year B.P. channeling also generally exhibit a sharp erosional
boundary between the Copan paleosol and overlying alluvium. At site 41TR170, no evidence for
the post-paleosol channel trenching was observed, and the boundary between the West Fork
paleosol and overlying alluvium is gradational, obscured by bioturbation (Figure 9). The small
project area may simply not be large enough to incorporate a post-paleosol channel fill.

Post-Paleosol Alluvium
The slow development of the cumulic West Fork paleosol ended upon its burial by recent
alluvium. The post-paleosol alluvium caps the paleosol in every trench exposure at site 41TR170
except in those few cases where historic disturbance has resulted in sediment removal, exposing
the top of the paleosol at the disturbed surface. The post-paleosol alluvium is uniformly a grayish
brown (10YR 5/2) clayey silt and fine sand, lighter in color than the dark gray paleosol. It
averages 48 cm in thickness and ranges from 34 cm (Trench 8) to 68 cm (Trench 7) in thickness.
It is massive without primary bedding structures preserved. The sediments are calcareous but
lack visible carbonates such as filaments along root traces. A single radiocarbon age of 150 Â± 40
14
C years B.P. on charcoal (Trench 6) from a buried burned tree was obtained on the post-paleosol
alluvium. The post-paleosol alluvium, if correlative with other post-paleosol alluvial units in the
region, may have been deposited between about 800 and 100 years ago. If so, its sedimentation
rate may be similar to that of the underlying paleosol. However, in contrast to the cumulic soil
depositional environment, the post-paleosol alluvium likely accumulated during fewer flood
events, but each flood produced a thicker layer of sandy sediment deposited on the wooded
floodplain. A deeper channel may have been present in the Clear Fork valley during the past 800
years at the time of the deposition of the post-paleosol alluvium.
A historic A horizon soil sometimes occurs at the modern surface of late Holocene floodplain
terraces in the region. A faint hint of a very weak A horizon was observed in the uppermost 5â10
cm at a few trench exposures (cf. Trenches 23 and 24) at site 41TR170.
51

Sediment Characteristics

Sand, Silt, Clay
Alluvium, including the West Fork paleosol, from two trenches at site 41TR170 was analyzed for
texture, organic carbon, and carbonates (see Table 4). As can be seen from the data, the alluvial
sediments are predominantly fine-textured sandy, clayey silt. The sediments from Trench 6 are
uniformly finer grained with larger amounts of silt than sediments from Trench 14. This
relationship may be due to the presence of Trench 6 on the inside of the Clear Fork meander
curve, resulting in less sand and more clayey silt deposited on the floodplain during flooding.
Trench 14 is located on the outside of the meander curve. The sand fraction is dominated by very
fine to fine quartz sand. Again, the sediment column from Trench 6 is finer textured than the
sediments from Trench 14.

Organic Carbon
The sediments from the West Fork paleosol have a higher amount of organic carbon than does the
underlying and overlying alluvium in Trench 14. However, in Trench 6, organic carbon is
moderately high in both paleosol and nonpaleosol sediments alike.

Carbonates
All of the alluvium has a high amount of CaCO3 ranging from approximately 31 to 43 percent.
There does not seem to be a pattern to the carbonate content in the alluvium. The carbonates may
be largely detrital, derived from the local nearby Cretaceous limestone and marl bedrock. In
Trench 6, there is a slight increase in carbonates with depth, probably related to groundwater.

Gravels

Gravels in the Late Holocene Alluvium
The alluvium along the Clear Fork is generally fine-grained silty, fine sand, and clay, reflecting
the Lower Cretaceous limestone bedrock in the Clear Fork drainage. Occasionally, the fine
overbank alluvium will contain small, rounded, isolated limestone pebbles with occasional
Cretaceous oyster shells and clam fragments. These isolated occurrences of small individual
gravels are generally between 4 mm and 16 mm in diameter and are natural components of the
alluvium. The isolated gravels occur in the grayish brown clay unit and in the West Fork
paleosol. The small limestone pebbles all have a carbonate crust (<0.5 mm thick) and a thin
yellow weathering rind (ca. 1-4 mm thick); these properties indicate that the pebbles are reworked
from older gravels in the Clear Fork river valley. The occurrence of larger stones in excess of 40
mm in diameter may indicate prehistoric cultural activity; stones of these sizes are too large to be
transported in suspension and deposited with muds in overbank alluvium.

52

Zones of gravels occur in basal West Fork paleosol sediments in Trenches 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23,
and 24. The gravel zones range from 10 cm (Trench 23) to 44 cm (Trench 9) in thickness. A
single zone of gravel averaging 24 cm thick occurs at the base of the paleosol in Trenches 17, 18,
19, and 20. Two gravel zones, each averaging 13 cm thick, occur in Trenches 8, 9, 23, and 24
(the gravel zone in Trench 9 is a thick single layer of gravel that correlates with the two layers of
gravel in adjacent Trench 8; in other words, the gravel in Trench 9 represents the same two
episodes of deposition observed in Trench 8 but not separated by a clay, thus it appears to be a
single layer of gravel instead of two).
In most cases, the base of the West Fork paleosol coincides with the top of the gravel zone. The
gravels range in size from 2 mm in diameter (the lower limit of the definition of gravel) to 130
mm in diameter. Most of the gravels are in the 2â4-mm-diameter size class. The gravels are
poorly sorted and may have been deposited by a single flood event with sufficient stream
discharge to entrain, suspend, transport, and deposit them on the broad floodplain during the early
stage of cumulic soil development.
As can be seen in Figure 10, size frequency of gravels (2,001 clasts) in the late Holocene
alluvium can be compared with basal cemented gravels of possible Pleistocene age (1,191 clasts)
but both groups of gravels are dominated by granules in the 2â4-mm category. Although some
differences are apparent, the similarities in the size data suggest that either the sources of gravels
during the Pleistocene and Holocene are the same or that the Holocene gravels are reworked from
the Pleistocene gravel deposits. If the Holocene gravels are reworked from older deposits, it
would account for the presence of gravels only in the earliest late Holocene floodplain alluvium.
By the time the West Fork paleosol and post-paleosol alluvium were deposited, the Pleistocene
gravels would be buried and not available for reworking. On the other hand, mean clast size of
the Holocene gravels is larger than that of the Pleistocene gravels. It would be expected that, if
the Holocene gravels are simply reworked Pleistocene gravels, the Holocene gravels should be
generally smaller in size, not the other way around. The only explanation that seems reasonable
is that the Pleistocene gravels observed and sampled in Trench 19 are not representative of the
larger gravel population in the Clear Fork drainage basin and that the gravels elsewhere upstream
are larger than the ones reported in this investigation.

Pleistocene Gravels
Carbonate-cemented gravels occur at the base of Trenches 18 and 19 and, although undated, may
represent a buried edge of the late Pleistocene Carrollton alluvial gravels (Ferring 1990). The
gravel deposit has a yellow clay matrix. The gravels are entirely rounded limestone and exhibit
weak sorting. Clasts are generally < 20 mm in diameter, with large individual clasts, to 40 mm in
diameter. The whitish limestone gravels have 2-mm-thick yellow weathering rinds as well as
carbonate coats approximately 0.5 mm thick. Cemented masses of gravels occur in lenses instead
of a single layer; secondary carbonates appear to be water-table-related rather than pedogenic.
The degree of cementation and thickness of weathering rinds indicate that the gravel deposit in
Trenches 18 and 19 may be Pleistocene in age.

Fossil Snail and Mussel Shells

Snails
All of the late Holocene alluvium at site 41TR170 contains isolated shells of fossil snails of a
variety of species. The larger, more conspicuous shells are of the land snail Rabdotus and the
smaller Helicina. Aquatic species are rare in the alluvial deposits, occurring mainly at the base of
Trench 14. Rabdotus is uncommon at the site today, having been replaced by a polygyrid as the
dominant large land snail.
Also common on the modern wooded floodplain-terrace surface is Rumina decollata, a European
import that is considered a garden pest today in Texas. It was first reported in the United States
in South Carolina in 1822, and later in Brownsville, Texas, in 1913, and in Dallas, Texas, in 1933
(Pilsbry 1946:170). Although it burrows, shells of this species were not observed in the recent
alluvium overlying the West Fork paleosol, indicating that the young post-paleosol alluvium may
be predominantly older than the twentieth century.
54

Freshwater Mussel Shells
Occasional mussel shells occur in the late Holocene alluvium, mostly in the clays of the West
Fork paleosol. Many of the shells observed in trench walls are concave up. Because of the shape
of curved shells and their dynamics with running water, the natural mode of deposition of these
shells in a stream environment is concave down. Thus, it is reasonable to attribute these
occurrences of mussels to human activity.

Radiocarbon Dates
Eight radiocarbon dates provide a good, internally consistent foundation for the alluvial
chronology of the Clear Fork valley (Table 5). The entire alluvial sequence above the cemented
gravels is less than 3,000 years old. The radiocarbon geochronology of the alluvium at 41TR170
is consistent with the regional late Holocene record.

in Appendix I.

Three ages from Trench 14, however, seem to be at least 25 percent too young (bulk sediment
and charcoal alike). The three ages are internally consistent, suggesting that the young ages are
site-specific. The West Fork paleosol at Trench 14 is only 65 cm thick, one of the thinnest
locations of the paleosol except at Trenches 18 and 19. If the paleotopography of the Clear Fork
floodplain was slightly higher where Trench 14 was dug, the systematic youngness of the
paleosol and other alluvium can be explained. Overbank sediments, including the cumulic
55

paleosol, would accumulate earliest in topographically low areas on the floodplain and,
accordingly, later on topographically high areas. Thus, differences of a few hundred years in the
geochronology of the formation of the West Fork paleosol can be accounted for. Unfortunately,
high-resolution GPS elevational data that would provide information on floodplain topography
and paleotopography, thereby verifying the above explanation of age differences in the alluvium,
were not taken during the study.
Additional radiocarbon dates on wood charcoal were obtained from buried cultural features and
are presented elsewhere in this report. The ages of the features and the age of the associated
alluvial stratigraphy appear to be discordant, the features generally younger than the correlated
alluvium. Some of the differences may be related to paleotopography of the 2,000- to 1,000-yearold floodplain surface such as may account for the variability in radiocarbon ages of the alluvial
sediment discussed above. Prehistoric cultural activity on the floodplain may have been
concentrated on topographic high points, avoiding the lower wet places. If so, the radiocarbon
ages, while correct, may seem too young when compared with ages from alluvium that represents
both low and high points on the floodplain depositional surface.

HOLOCENE LANDSCAPE AND ENVIRONMENT
Earth science processes are not random across the landscape. Patterns exist due to variations in
bedrock, vegetation, hydrology, and climate, producing unique records. As one variable shifts,
others do as well, altering the consequences and producing a new record of events.

Clear Fork
The channel of the Clear Fork and other tributaries of the Trinity as well as the Trinity River itself
exhibit moderately formed meander geometry, suggesting that the channel moves or meanders
across its floodplain through time, continuously cutting and backfilling. If the streams in the
Trinity River drainage were meandering back and forth across their floodplains, the stratigraphic
as well as the archeological record would be obliterated with the passage of time. However, this
does not appear to be the case. While the stream channels have a meander pattern geometry, the
sediments do not indicate a history of meandering cut-and-fill valley process. Rather, the history
of the Clear Fork as well as other regional streams is a pattern of basin-wide sedimentation and
down-cutting that is in response to regional climate change, a pattern that occurs simultaneously
throughout a drainage basin (Figure 11). The meander channel geometry either developed prior
to overbank sedimentation 3,000 years ago, or it was a shallow meandering channel that down-cut
and stabilized ca. 1,000 years ago when other channels became incised in the region or ca. 100Â±
years ago accompanying land clearance and introduction of livestock by American settlers.

Paleoecology of West Fork Paleosol
Over-thickened A horizon cumulic soils are not common in alluvial records. Some thinner A
horizons may represent local floodplain stability for a century or two, long enough for organic
matter to accumulate in a distinct zone. Cumulic soils a meter thick such as the Copan-West
Fork, however, represent a major significant event in the fluvial history of stream valleys in the
southcentral United States.

and only channel of the Clear Fork in this area of the valley.

Sedimentation
The thick cumulic soil forms by slow aggradation on a broad flat alluvial valley. The valley may
or may not have a channel. If a channel is present, it is shallow. If a channel is not present,
runoff spreads over the valley floor. Sedimentation is by overbank or valley-wide spreading.
The sediments deposited are fine textured: very fine sand, silt, and clay. The 1-m-thick West
Fork paleosol accumulated over a period of about 1,000 to 1,500 years, resulting in a
sedimentation rate of 0.7â1.0 mm per year. Because of the slow rate of sediment accumulation,
primary sedimentologic structures such as laminations, cross-bedding, and clay drapes are
obliterated by the bioturbation effects of burrowing animals.

Paleoclimate
Thick cumulic soils form in Great Plains stream valleys during periods of comparatively wet
climate. The amount of moisture is uncertain, but the interaction of surface moisture and
vegetation density is crucial. Increased precipitation increases plant density, whether prairie or
woodland, thereby increasing water retention in local soils. Although surface water is more
abundant, streams transport less sediment because the watersheds are more densely vegetated,
and sediment supply by sheet erosion is largely diminished. Other effects are high water tables in
alluvial valleys, abundant springs, and perennial stream flow. Valley floors are wet meadows
where the plant communities are dominated by sedges and riparian grasses (as indicated below by
carbon isotopes).
A review of the paleoenvironmental record from southcentral United States shows that plant
communities (pollen), vertebrate faunas, and molluscan faunas reflect moister conditions about
2,000 to 1,000 years ago, the period of formation of the Copan-West Fork paleosol (Hall 1982,
57

1988, 1990). An exhaustive faunal study at Hallâs Cave also shows a comparatively wet period
between about 2,000 and 1,000 years ago in Central Texas (Toomey 1993). Other studies show
the corroboration of faunal, paleoclimatic, and fluvial evidence (Blum et al. 1994; Toomey et al.
1993). The paleolandscape record is clear and consistent.
The empirical paleoenvironmental record also shows that about 1,000 years ago the moist
conditions that led to the development of the Copan-West Fork paleosol ended. Decreased
precipitation led to a decrease in plant cover, an increase in runoff and a greater sediment load in
streams, a lowering of the alluvial water table, and incision of valley floors. The Clear Fork
channel may have deepened at this time, and occasional floods carried greater amounts of
sediment onto the floodplain, burying the West Fork paleosol by 0.5 m of sandy clay.

Carbon Isotopes and Late Holocene Vegetation
C4 plants have isotope values ranging from -16 to -9 â° with a mean value of -13 â°. C4 plants
are few in number and on a continental scale are regarded as warm-season grasses and are
generally absent from cooler regions. C3 plants have carbon isotope values ranging from -33 to 22 with a mean value of -27 â°. C3 species are cool-season grasses and are all of the woody
plants in the vegetation. Because the vegetation is made up of both C3 and C4 species, the carbon
isotopic composition of soils will be an amalgam of the two groups and will fall between -27 and
-13 â°. When Î´13C values fall above -20 â°, C4 plants dominate, and where Î´13C values fall
below -20 â°, C3 plants dominate the vegetation. The general abundance of C4 plants on a
subcontinental scale across North America has been compared with various climatic variables and
has been found to correlate positively with temperature, especially mean July minimum
temperatures (Teeri and Stowe 1976).
The Î´13C values from two separate sections in the late Holocene Clear Fork alluvium show a
consistent pattern (Figure 12). In both sections, the pre-paleosol and West Fork paleosol
alluvium have mean Î´13C values of -18.4 Â± 0.36 and -18.3 Â± 0.28 â°, respectively. The postpaleosol alluvium has a mean Î´13C value of -20.8 Â± 1.07 â°. The data are presented in Table 6.
A literal interpretation of the carbon isotope data is that the proportion of C3 and C4 plants in the
vegetation at TR170 has remained the same during the period ca. 2400 to 1000 years BP with C4
plants dominating the community. Subsequent to the end of the formation of the West Fork
paleosol, after ca. 1000 years BP, the vegetation shifted to a local community dominated by C3
plants (Figure 13).

Stable Carbon Isotopes and Paleoclimate at Site 41TR170
Given the positive relationship between the abundance of C4 plants and temperature (Boutton
1996), a literal interpretation of a shift from C4 to C3 plants represents a corresponding shift from
warm-season to cool-season grasses and a general lowering of temperatures. Paleoclimatic
reconstructions, using the modern analog, generally equate lower temperatures with increased
moisture and higher temperatures with decreased moisture, a relationship that is observed in
many cases (Boutton et al. 1980). Thus, the alluvial isotope record can be interpreted literally as
a late Holocene shift from comparatively warm-dry to cool-wet conditions in north-central Texas.

Distribution of Î´13C values from late Holocene Clear Fork alluvium at site 41TR170

Figure 12. Distribution of Î´13C values from late Holocene Clear Fork alluvium at site 41TR170; carbon isotope and
organic carbon values from Table 4; West Fork paleosol has higher amounts of organic carbon than prepaleosol alluvium; however, the carbon isotope signature of the paleosol and pre-paleosol alluvium is the
same; the post-paleosol alluvium has lower Î´13C values (more negative) than the paleosol or pre-paleosol
alluvium

The above paleoclimatic reconstruction, however, is at odds with other paleoecological records
from the region. Indeed, the above interpretation of the Î´13C record from late Holocene alluvium
is entirely counter to the published information from regional alluvial stratigraphy,
sedimentology, fossil vertebrates, and land snails (Hall 1982, 1988, 1990; Blum et al. 1994;
Toomey 1993; Toomey et al. 1993).
The question remains: What does the Î´13C record from late Holocene alluvium show if not a shift
in C4-C3 plants and climate? First, it is important to point out that the modern C4-climate
relationship was established from upland plant communities. Plant species from riparian habitats
were not included in the analyses. This omission may be important when looking at Î´13C values
from alluvium. A number of C4 species are riparian plants: sedges (Carex), sacaton (Sporobolus),
reed (Phragmites), and cane (Arundinaria), all with species that are found on wet meadows and
floodplains of aggrading streams with a high alluvial water table. Thus, alluvial sediments of
floodplains will have an organic carbon Î´13C signature that reflects at least in part the riparian
plant community. During floods, sediment that is derived from sheet erosion of upland top soils
is deposited on floodplains. As a result, fine-textured overbank alluvium will contain a mix of
organic carbon originating from both upland and riparian plant communities. If a floodplain is
small, the input of organic carbon from riparian species may also be small compared with that
derived from upland top soils. If a floodplain is wide, however, a riparian component of the
organic carbon content of the alluvium may be substantial.
In the case of Clear Fork Trinity River at 41TR170, the floodplain is fairly wide, 0.6 to 1.0 miles
across. The meandering channel was approx 60 m wide and approx. 3-4 m deep prior to it being
filled with construction debris (see Figure 11). The sediments that make up the late Holocene

alluvium are fine-textured clayey and sandy silts; the sand fraction is generally very fine to fine
quartz (see Table 4). The organic carbon content ranges from 0.73 to 1.50 % (see Table 6). The
fine-textured sediments are characteristic of overbank floodplain deposits. The West Fork
paleosol is part of the sediment package. It is a cumulic over-thickened A horizon soil
characterized by higher percentages of organic carbon than older or younger alluvium (see Figure
12). The higher amounts of organic carbon in the paleosol may reflect lower sedimentation rates.
With a slower rate of alluviation, larger amounts of organic carbon from riparian plants will be
incorporated into the floodplain deposits.

Stratigraphic sequence of carbon isotopes in late Holocene alluvium at site 41TR170

Figure 13. Stratigraphic sequence of carbon isotopes in late Holocene alluvium at site 41TR170; the radiocarbon ages
from Trench 14 are consistently too young compared with the other dated sections as discussed in the text;
carbon isotope data from Table 6.

The West Fork paleosol and alluvium underlying the paleosol collectively have a mean Î´13C
signature of -18.3 Â± 0.32 â°. These organic carbon isotope values are a result of a mix of riparian
C4 and upland C3 sources. The enriched (less negative) Î´13C signature is a result of the wetground floodplain environment and the presence of sedges and other riparian C4 species.
The end of the formation of the West Fork paleosol ca. 1000 years ago was caused by a regional
climatic change to drier conditions and the deepening of the Clear Fork channel (discussed by
Hall 1990). Channel erosion and lowering of the alluvial water table occurred together, resulting
in a drying of the floodplain and a change in the riparian plant community. Wet meadow C4
plants were replaced by dry-habitat C3 species. Accordingly, the organic carbon contribution to
the old floodplain surface experienced a shift in Î´13C values reflecting the shift from C4 to C3
plants. As a consequence of the change in riparian and floodplain vegetation, post-paleosol
alluvium incorporated greatly reduced amounts of organic carbon derived from C4 species,
resulting in a depleted (more negative) Î´13C values as documented in the alluvial sequence (see
Figure 13).
The above scenario describes a case study where processes of sedimentation and geomorphology
partially dictate the direction of the Î´13C trends in alluvium. The organic carbon found in alluvial
deposits is derived from both upland and riparian environments that can have differing C4 and C3
plant communities. Overbank sediments deposited on the wide floodplain of a moderate to large
stream will have a Î´13C signature that reflects the blend of organic carbon derived from the
uplands in the watershed and from the streamâs floodplain. A shift in the sedimentation or
geomorphology of a stream valley may result in a shift in the proportion of organic carbon from
C4 and C3 species that is incorporated in the alluvium, giving a false signal of vegetation and
climatic change.

61

Other Stable Isotope Studies
Fort Hood. A long sequence of carbon isotopes has been documented from Holocene alluvium
in central Texas (Nordt et al. 1994). The sequence parallels that from Clear Fork with Î´13C
values indicating a dominance of C4 plants during the late Holocene and a shift to significantly
lower amounts of C4 species in the past 400 years. The carbon isotope record is conservatively
interpreted as representing 60-65% warm-season grasses (C4) from ca. 4000 to 2000 years BP and
a shift to 65-70% warm-season grasses (C4) ca. 2000 years BP to present with a short-duration
warming episode ca. 2000 years BP.
The issue of upland versus a riparian origin of the organic carbon (and the resulting Î´13C
signature) in alluvium was recognized and addressed by Nordt et al. (1994:114):
Throughout most of the Holocene, the streams in Fort Hood had entrenched channels and low
floodplain water tables. These factors, coupled with numerous flash-flood events, have prevented
appreciable colonization of riparian plants on point bars and along the channel that may contribute
spurious transported Î´13C signatures to the alluvial sequence.

The above situation does not apply to Clear Fork where the wide floodplain and late Holocene
sequence of slowly-accumulating overbank deposits in a floodplain environment differ from the
smaller streams with flashy discharge at Fort Hood, central Texas.
Aubrey Clovis site. A 14,000-year section of alluvium from the Aubrey Clovis site on the Elm
Fork Trinity River, Denton Co., has been investigated for a stable carbon and oxygen isotope
record (Humphrey and Ferring 1994; Ferring 1990). Unfortunately for comparison with the Clear
Fork record, the late Holocene alluvium dated between 3030 and 1730 years BP is documented
by only six carbon isotope samples; younger isotope data were not reported (Humphrey and
Ferring 1994:205).
Although the isotope data are sparse, a paleoclimatic sequence is presented by Humphrey and
Ferring (1994:211) that first appeared in Ferring (1990:44). The climatic reconstruction shows a
wet climate 5000-2000 and 1000 years BP to present and a dry climate from 2000 to 1000 years
BP. The empirical basis that is cited for a generally wetter climate during the late Holocene is the
pollen records from Ferndale (SE Oklahoma) and Boriack bogs (E Texas). While the pollen
records show that the late Holocene climate was indeed recovering from a mid-Holocene dry
period and becoming wetter, the pollen records do not show evidence for alternating wet-dry-wet
episodes that correlate with the late Holocene alluvial sequences. Furthermore, the late Holocene
climate reconstruction presented by Ferring (1990) and Humphrey and Ferring (1994) is at odds
with the published paleoecological record from Texas and Oklahoma.
GEOARCHEOLOGY
As earth science processes are not random, the archeological record is likewise not random across
the landscape. An understanding of their relationships provides insight to both. Portions of site
41TR170 are buried by 1â2 m of alluvial clays. Multiple-stone features were found at the base
(Trench 22) and below the base (Trench 19) of the West Fork paleosol. Why are the features at
this depth and not at a more shallow depth? One explanation may be that at the time of
occupation, the floodplain was not flooding as much and may have been wooded. Second, the
location of the site at Trench 19 coincides with a topographic high on the pre-paleosol floodplain.
The site was 139 cm above the low point in the floodplain about 2,300 years ago.
62

Isolated burned stones and mussel shells occur at various depths within the West Fork paleosol
sediments, as encountered in backhoe trenches. Their presence is likely cultural in origin; the
stones and shells are too large to be easily transported by overbank or valley-spreading
floodwater.
The fine-textured alluvial clays are strongly bioturbated by small burrowing animals such as
earthworms, insects, and land snails. Consequently, sharp boundaries that distinguish primary
sedimentologic structures such as lamellae and cross-beds are lost. Also lost are the sharp
stratigraphic boundaries between alluvial units and erosional unconformities such as shown in
Figure 8. The sharp borders of some prehistoric cultural features may become obscure as well.
Theoretically and in practice, materials within the sediment column, such as pollen, soil
chemistry and isotopes, magnetic particles, seeds, small bones, and snail shells, are also moved
around, potentially masking direct stratigraphic relationships with cultural features.
Scale and degree of bioturbation are the prime issues to be addressed in relation to the
archeological record preserved at a site. Of course, soil particles and small objects within the soil
are still there; they have just been moved from their primary context. In the case of site
41TR170, the scale of movement is comparatively small because the burrowing animals are
small. In an estimation of the degree of turbation that would take place at a single horizon, it is
likely that 50 percent of the particles are moved less than 5 cm, 35 percent have been moved 5â10
cm, and 15 percent have been moved more than 10 cm. This assumes 100 percent bioturbation, a
number that may be too high as well as not possible to really know. The amount of movement
can be estimated based on the degree of particle displacement seen in Figure 9 where the
unconformity between the paleosol and post-paleosol sediment is obscured by small burrow fills.
The small scale and high degree of bioturbation accompanying cumulic A horizon soil
accumulation (such as the West Fork paleosol) is probably universal (Courty et al. 1989:140â146;
Retallack 2001:128â159). However, the fine clayey texture of these cumulic soils is a substrate
generally avoided by burrowing rodents and other mammals. As a result, the severe bioturbation
characteristic of sandy soils of West and East Texas has not occurred along the Clear Fork
(Johnson 1989, 1990). In some sandy regions, such as seen at Fort Bliss, badgers literally churn
up almost the entire upper meter of surficial sediment (Johnson and Johnson 2004). This extreme
scale of bioturbation has not occurred at site 41TR170 where, instead, the scale of bioturbation is
comparatively small and stratigraphic units maintain their overall integrity.
Because the burrowing animals along the Clear Fork valley are small, they have not disturbed
small stones and rocks that make up cultural features. An earthworm will go around an obstacle
such as a small stone (> 20 mm in diameter), leaving the stoneâs position and orientation intact.
Earthworm burrow fills are about 4 mm in diameter, insects produce burrow fills about 6 mm in
diameter, and land snail burrow fills are generally no larger than about 8 mm in diameter
(Johnson et al. 2005).
In conclusion, while bioturbation of clayey sediments and the West Fork paleosol at site
41TR170 is strong, the scale of turbation is comparatively small. Regions with sandy soils will
be characterized by more severe bioturbation by rodents and larger mammals than present in
Tarrant County. The scale and amount of bioturbation at this site is no more and no less than that
occurring at similar sites along stream valleys in the Trinity River drainage basin.

63

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The Clear Fork alluvial record at site 41TR170 is less than 3,000 years old. About 3,000 to 2,500
years ago, yellow clayey alluvium was deposited on an old surface composed of cemented
limestone gravels (Pleistocene?). About 2,500 years ago, these valley yellow clay deposits were
eroded during a brief episode of incision. By about 2,400 years, the valley began to aggrade
again, and gray clay and a thin layer of gravels were deposited on the eroded yellow clay. Soon
afterwards, perhaps as early as 2,300 years ago, the climate changed to increased precipitation.
The alluvial water table rose, stream flow became permanent, and the floodplain became a wet
meadow. Silt and clay carried by occasional floodwaters spread over the valley floor. The slow
accumulation of muds formed a 1-m-thick cumulic soil between about 2,300 and 1,000 years ago.
Regional climate changed again about 1,000 years ago to drier conditions. The alluvial water
table dropped. The Clear Fork channel down-cut through its floodplain. After down-cutting, the
cumulic soil no longer formed, and floods deposited sediments on top of the old soil (now called
the West Fork paleosol), burying it by 0.5 m of sandy clay.

CHAPTER 5
ARCHEOLOGICAL RESULTS

This section presents the results of the 2005 GMI archeological investigations conducted at site
41TR170. The 19 features encountered during the project are described before the discussion of
the material remains recovered from the project. A final section briefly summarizes the
distribution of features and artifacts encountered in the 10 deep test units and the three excavation
blocks.

FEATURES
A total of 19 features was identified across the site area of 41TR170 (Table 7). The features are
numbered consecutively from 1â18 and the final feature is number 20. The number 19 was not
assigned. These cultural anomalies occur both north (Features 3, 4, 5, 12, and 20) and south (the
14 other features) of the relic channel of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River. Based on the feature
distribution, the area south of the relic channel appears to be the more intensively used, due to the
prominent occurrence of features near the edge of the Pleistocene gravel bar, which represents an
area with some relief near the river.
All features, except Feature 5, which is a charcoal-flecked stained area, consist of burned limestone
or sandstone rocks that were transported to their current locations. The rocks tend to be larger than
those found in the cemented gravel zone of the Pleistocene channel as exposed in Trenches 19
and 20 along the southern site area. Thus, the burned rocks are derived from either the incised
paleochannels, which may coincide with the modern relic channel in the middle of the site, or the
Duck Creek, Kiamichi, and Goodland geological exposures along the valley margins. Most of
the rock features encountered during Stage 3 excavations were found in the southerly Blocks 1
and 3. The predominant limestones and sandstones in these features were probably carried south
from the presumed location of the relic channel about 150 m away or from the base of the
geological exposures more than 700 m away. Although there is strong evidence noted for the
reuse of rock in burned features, the quantities of burned rock found along the southern margin of
the site indicate a considerable labor expenditure involved in the initial rock procurement.

Based on the morphology of the 18 features with burned rock, six different kinds of named
functions are postulated (Table 8). These include shallow rock-filled warming pits (Features 8, 9,
20, and possibly 13), a formal deep hearth or roasting pit (Feature 12), a very large incipient earth
oven (Feature 17) with a concentric series of low dump piles (Features 14, 15, 16), other small
rake-off or rock dump features (Features 2, 3, possibly 4 and 11), possible recycled burned rock
stock pile (Features 6 and possibly 11), a large fitted griddle area (Feature 10), and several
features of unknown or undetermined function (Features 1, 7, and 18). Various artifacts and
ecofacts (including flakes, projectile points, freshwater mussel shell, and bone) were recovered
near several features, and an array of samples (including sediments for flotation, lipid, and
radiocarbon assays) were collected from these features in hopes of identifying economic activities
and determining absolute dates. The numbers, kinds, and diversity of materials associated with
the features must be regarded as a minimal count due to the collection of sediment samples and
the preliminary tally provided herein. Each feature is discussed below in order of its assigned
number.

Features from Deep Test Units

Feature 1 (Deep Test Unit 1; 84â90 cm bs)
Feature 1 consisted of a tight cluster of six burned rocks protruding from the sidewall of the
northwest corner of Test Unit 1, a deep test unit, located adjacent to Trench 1 just south of the
relic river channel. No further units were excavated to open this area and fully expose the feature
since the goal of excavations at the time was to dig Unit 1 to a depth of 2 m. Thus, little
information was gained about the nature of these rocks, their construction, or their function.
Essentially six burned limestone rocks weighing 741g were tightly clustered in an area measuring
at least 25 cm (north-south) by 10 cm (east-west) in the upper portion of the West Fork paleosol.
The upper portions of the burned rocks were at a depth of 84 cm and extended to 90 cm below
surface. Stratigraphically, this 6-cm-thick burned rock cluster represented one of the youngest
features within the site. The rocks might be the edge of a hearth, part of a dump, or a rake-off
cluster, but mapping showed them to be confined to a very compact area. No charcoal was
observed with these cobbles. A sample of sediments collected from the southeastern corner of the
unit for flotation yielded only a rhabdotus snail shell and a 10-x-4-x-6 cm piece of concrete with
one finished surface. The six burned rocks were collected. Other materials from the same level
as the feature included 17 freshwater mussel shells, 16 of which were unidentifiable shell
fragments, and one was classified as a Plectomerus dombeyanus. Two unidentifiable animal
bones as well as 10 small fragments of possible baked clay were also recovered from this level.

Feature 2 (Deep Test Unit 1; 142â155 cm bs)
Feature 2 was a tight cluster of five burned rocks within a 24-cm (north-south) by 20-cm (eastwest) area in the southwest corner of Test Unit 1 at a depth of 142â155 cm bs (Figure 14). This
13-cm-thick feature was east of and about 55 cm below Feature 1 and was obviously from a much
earlier component. Due to the small area of the clustered rocks and the lack of associated
occurrence of charcoal, this feature probably represented a discard pile or rake-off cluster of
burned rock materials from a more formal feature that occurred beyond the present limits of the
test unit. No further investigations were expanded in this area to ascertain the nature of this
cluster of rocks. Sixty-two burned rocks totaling 2,169 g were collected from this feature context.
The four mussel shell fragments consist of three unidentified specimens and one Quadrula
pustulosa mortoni. One secondary flake and one possible spokeshave were recovered from this
level; both are made from Brazos/Uvalde Gravel. One piece of animal bone recovered near the
feature was identified as a medium-sized ungulate specimen exhibiting a green fracture.

Feature 4 (Deep Test Unit 3; 115â122 cm bs)
Feature 4 was a tight concentration of burned limestone and a few other outlying clasts exposed
in the east wall of Trench 23 at a depth of 115â122 cm bs. Test Unit 3 was placed on the east
side of Trench 23 to investigate these rocks. The rocks comprising Feature 4 were discrete from a
dark charcoal-flecked stain and a few rocks noted in the southeast corner of the same test unit at
the same depth, designated as Feature 5.

The rock cluster from Feature 4 consisted of about 20 rock clasts measuring 5â18 cm in diameter
that were compacted in an area measuring 50 cm (north-south) by at least 35 cm (east-west) and
about 7 cm thick (Figure 15). Ten other clasts were scattered up to 30 cm from this cluster in the
upper part of the feature and were regarded as part of the rock concentration. Thus, the total
extant feature was confined within a 98-cm (north-south) by 72-cm (east-west) area. The extent
of disturbance to the feature from backhoe trenching is unknown. The cross-section observations
indicated that the rocks were on an amorphous surface, but plan maps indicated that the rocks are
at least two courses high with the lower level consisting of six rocks within a 50-x-28-cm area
directly beneath the greatest concentration in the higher level. Several pieces of charcoal were
directly associated with the burned rocks. The dark sediments of the West Fork paleosol
prevented detection of any pit feature. The occurrence of confined rocks over two layers
suggested that they might be in a pit or in a pile. The function of the burned rock cluster is
uncertain. If a basin were present, then the rocks might reflect some primary stone-heating
element, or perhaps a small roasting pit; alternatively, if they represent a pile, then the rocks may
signify a rake-off, dump, or discard from hearth clearing or heating activities.
Materials recovered from Feature 4 include snails, three small (>19 mm) chipped stone flakes
(two are secondary and one is tertiary), three animal bones identified as turtle, and 104 (5.5 kg) of
burned rock.

Feature 5 (Deep Test Unit 3; 120â124 cm bs)
Feature 5 consisted of an area of darker stained soil with concentrated charcoal flecking in the
southeastern corner of Test Unit 3 at a depth of 120â124 cm bs (Figure 16). The 4-cm-thick
charcoal-stained lens occurred in an area measuring at least 60 cm (north-south) by 60 cm (eastwest) and was not associated with an oxidized base. Four small (roughly 7-cm diameter) burned
rocks, 11 unidentified mussel shell fragments, and seven snail shells were found with the feature.
The dark staining and charcoal occurred 60 cm east of the clustered rocks and 24 cm to the east of
the outlier rocks of Feature 4 within Test Unit 3. The dark charcoal-flecked area was relatively
shallow and hence might be either a shallow heating basin in primary context that did not oxidize
the basal soil, or the scraped-off cleaning matrix from some hearth feature that was buried by
alluvial deposits soon after the cleaning event.

Feature 7 (Deep Test Unit 6; 133â144 cm bs)
Feature 7 represented a tight cluster and adjacent wide scatter of burned limestone rock in the
extreme northwest corner of Test Unit 6 at a depth of 133â144 cm bs (Figure 17). The test unit
was located next to Backhoe Trench 25, which was some 10 m south of the relic channel of the
Clear Fork of the Trinity River.

The tight rock cluster was restricted to an 11-cm-thick area in the extreme corner of the test unit
and measured 20 cm (north-south) by 25 cm (east-west); presumably parts of this cluster
extended beyond the north and west walls of the unit. Other burned rocks occurred haphazardly
and widely spaced across the floor of the test unit and appeared to be scattered by flooding events
or foot traffic. These outlying stones demarcated an ephemeral occupation zone. The function of
this rock feature is unknown due to the small area of exposure, but it might be related to Feature
8. No artifacts were identified during excavation of the feature, but one sediment sample was
collected for waterscreening. Three pieces of baked clay were recovered as well as six flakes and
one piece of shatter. Thirty-three (1,213 g) burned rocks were recovered from 130â140 cm bs.
Charcoal, one piece of concrete, 18 unidentified mussel shell fragments, and eight snail shells
were also identified. Only two pieces of bone were recovered from this level; one is a green
fractured bone from a medium ungulate, the other is partially calcined but unidentifiable.

Feature 8 (Deep Test Unit 6; 149â169 cm bs)
Feature 8 occurred just below and to the east of Feature 7 within the northeast quadrant of Test
Unit 6. Feature 8 was an oval, basin-shaped hearth in the northeast corner of Test Unit 6,
adjacent to Backhoe Trench 25 (Figure 18). This feature measured 40 cm (north-south) by 58 cm
(east-west) and extended from 149â169 cm bs for a total depth of 20 cm. The upper 10 cm of this
feature consisted of a nearly level layer of concentrated burned rock numbering about 33 clasts,
and the lower 10 cm were composed of charcoal-flecked sediments lacking rocks confined to a
straight-walled pit with relatively flat base. Possible pit feature fill occurred above the rock layer,
but was not identified until the rocks were encountered. The profile indicated the lower
sediments and the overall feature to be contained within a straight-walled basin. This was clearly
a deep pit hearth or small oven feature, with a layer of rocks capping the fill matrix.
Two tertiary flakes and one piece of shatter were recovered from 145â150 cm bs, one small
secondary flake was recovered from 150â160 cm bs, and one bone fragment was identified just
south of this feature, but their association is uncertain. The 33 constituent burned rocks of the
feature were collected for analysis of size, shape, and weight data. A total of 107 (approximately
10.2 kg) burned rocks were recovered from 150â160 cm bs. One charcoal sample was collected.
No further investigations were undertaken in this area.

Features from Block 1

Feature 6 (Block 1, Unit 18; 88â100 cm bs)
Feature 6 was designated as a dense concentration of large burned limestone and sandstone rocks
located in the western half of Test Unit 18 of Block 1 (Figure 19). The rocks occurred in two-tothree tiers and consisted of mostly elongated limestone clasts measuring up to 20 cm long, which
was larger than most rocks found with features in Block 1. The overall dimension of Feature 6
was 82 cm (north-south) by 40 cm (east-west), and it extended from 88â100 cm bs for a total
thickness of 12 cm. Although densely packed, the rocks were apparently not directly touching
rocks in the adjacent layer. Due to the overall larger size of the clasts compared to those
occurring in adjacent features, the elongated shape of the rock cluster, and the lack of inherent
structure to the rock placement, it is possible that these rocks were culled from other features and

were piled as recycled lithic resources to be used in other rock-heating features. The structure,
form, and composition of these rocks differed from those of nearby Features 9 and 10 (see Figure
19).
Materials associated with Feature 6 include a wide range of cultural remains, including nine small
tertiary and secondary flakes, one edge-modified flake, 38 pieces of freshwater mussel shell
including Plectomerus dombeyanus and Quadrula pustulosa mortoni, 0.2 g of charcoal, and 271
rocks weighing about 11.1 kg. Six of the sandstone rocks from this cluster were collected for
lipid residue analysis.

Feature 9 (Block 1, Units 2 and 13; 91â121 cm bs)
Feature 9 was initially assigned to the general massive series of clusters and scatters of burned
rock in the southern portion of the site, about 148 m south of the relic river channel. Initial
efforts to open Trench 19 encountered massive quantities of burned rock at approximately 90 cm
bs. Accordingly, the trench was twice mechanically expanded south before an area of diminished
burned rock was found and the trench could be placed without destroying much of the feature
area. However, Deep Unit 2, which extended from the undisturbed ground surface through the
burned rock zone designated as Feature 9 to cemented caliche at a depth of 175, was placed 2.5 m
north of Trench 19. The designation was initially retained during the excavation of Units 2, 11,
and 12, which formed a north-south trench extending toward Trench 19. Nevertheless, the plan
of these units showed differential densities in the clustering of burned rock, and the profile of
these three units showed that burned rock extended into a shallow basin pit. At that point, the
Feature 9 designation was applied to the massive layer of burned rock and the underlying pit
feature with burned rock that was in the west half of Unit 2 and the east half of adjacent Unit 13
(see Figure 19). This concentration of rock first appeared at a depth of 91 cm bs and extended 30
cm in profile to a depth of 121 cm bs. Other scattered rocks, which were smaller and more
diffuse the farther from the pit feature, occurred mostly at the occupation surface in adjacent units
11, 13, and 14 over an area measuring some 130 cm (north-south) by 145 cm (east-west).
Materials associated with Feature 9 in Units 2 and 13 include nine flakes, 61 pieces of freshwater
mussel shell including Quadrula pustulosa mortoni, Amblema plicata, Fusconaia askewi,
Lampsilis teres, two small samples of charcoal, and some snails. In addition, 14 sandstone
cobbles were collected for possible lipid studies. About 58.6 kg of burned rock were collected,
and an additional 32.3 kg of burned rock were analyzed and left in the field; nearly all of it was
limestone.
Extraction of macrobotanical remains was undertaken on a single 5-liter sediment sample (Lot
342/FS 407) associated with Feature 9, 100â110 cm bs, in Unit 13 (see Appendix F). Light
fraction obtained by flotation was composed of 32 milliliters (ml; 6.1 g) of mostly modern
rootlets. Analysis of the residue noted the presence of moderate amounts of snails and two
uncharred (modern) seeds, but no charcoal whatsoever. The occurrence of abundant rootlet and
modern unburned seeds suggests that some displacement of recent remains has occurred at this
feature. No useful subsistence, economic, or activity data were obtained from the macrobotanical
analysis.

75

A small piece of wood charcoal weighing 0.2 g was recovered by GMI technicians from sediment
sample Lot 151/FS 286 using flotation methods. The charcoal came from Level 11 (100â110 cm
bs) of Test Unit 2 and was associated with Feature 9. This piece of charcoal was not sent for
macrobotanical identification, but was submitted to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon dating.
Despite the ability to extract the wood flecks from flotation, upon completion of radiocarbon
pretreatment, insufficient carbon was recovered; however, a humin fraction of the charred
material was recovered for dating. The resulting uncorrected radiocarbon date is 3630 Â± 40 B.P.
(Beta-213092) with a 13C/12C value of -22.5 â° that yields a conventional radiocarbon date of
3670 Â± 40 B.P. The 2-sigma calibration for this sample is cal B.C. 2140 to 1940 or cal B.P. 4100 to
3880. Note that the humin fraction has the potential to include older carbon from sediments or
even reworked paleosols redeposited during flood events; as such, the radiocarbon date does not
reliably reflect the age of the cultural occupation and is about 1,300 years earlier than the adjacent
radiocarbon date from Feature 13 in the same excavation block. The importance of the date does
provide insights into the degree of older carbon in the paleosols of the surrounding sediments.
Lipid analysis was conducted from a single rock from Feature 9. The specimen (Lot 341) came
from the northeast quarter of Unit 13, bottom half of Level 11 (105â110 cm bs). The lipid results
(6GM 1) indicated an extremely high fat content, possibly indicative of residues from seeds, nuts,
or rendered fats from non-large herbivore mammals. Based on the C18:1 isomers, the remains
were more likely from plants, although the specific plant(s) were not identified.

Feature 10 (Block 1, Units 12, 15, N19, N29; 88â100 cm bs)
Feature 10 represented a large circular concentration of burned rock in Test Units 12, 15, the
north half of 19, and the north half of 29, immediately north of Trench 19 and along the southern
edge of Block 1 (see Figure 19). Other features associated with this occupation zone in Block 1
included Features 6, 9, 11, and 13.
The concentration of rock comprising Feature 10 measured 110 cm (north-south) by 130 cm
(east-west) and ranged from 88â100 cm bs for a total depth 12 cm. The rocks comprising the
feature were relatively large (more than 10 cm in diameter) and unusually flat. Indeed, the upper
surface of these rocks seemed to have the same elevations as if they were fitted together to create
a single smooth surface. Some âheavy oxidationâ of sediments was noted under some burned
rocks, but charcoal and burned clay were sparse; the oxidation suggested that the heating
occurred in situ. In light of the tight placement of the flat rocks that appeared to be fitted together
to form a continuous surface with a similar upper elevation, it is possible that this feature might
have served as a large griddle or some other kind of flat heating hearth surface.
Chipped stone materials associated with Feature 10 include 31 lithic flakes, four pieces of shatter,
and one edge-modified flake. A total of 168 fragments of freshwater mussel shell was recovered,
these included Lampsilis teres, Quadrula pustulosa mortoni, Amblema plicata, Lampsilis
hydiana, Tritogonia verrucosa, Ligumia subrostrata. One possible ground stone (tool sharpening
abrader?) and some snails were also collected. Fourteen rocks were collected specifically for
lipid residue analysis. The amount of burned rock attributed to this feature is about 1,104
(approximately 44.1 kg) pieces.

76

Feature 11 (Block 1, Unit 16; 85â95 cm bs)
Located in Test Unit 16 in the northwest corner of Block 1, Feature 11 was a circular cluster of
burned rock just west of Feature 9, and partially overlying Feature 13. The rocks consisted of
medium to small pieces of angular limestone that were concentrated in an area about 70 cm in
diameter, with a scatter of sparse rocks on the living surface covering a larger area (Figure 20).
The rocks tended to be concentrated in a 10-cm-thick zone between 85 and 95 cm bs. About half
of the rocks were flat, but unlike Feature 10, these rocks appeared to be jumbled and with less
structure. The lack of a pit or depression suggested that these rocks were not part of a hearth or
cooking feature. The function of this feature is unknown; perhaps the stones represent a stockpile
of burned rock or a rake-off dump of rocks from adjacent Feature 9.
Figure

In the immediate vicinity of the feature, eight flakes, one piece of shatter, 6.6 g of charcoal, and a
sample of nine Rabdotus snails were recovered. In addition, 67 fragments of freshwater mussel
shell were collected, species identified included Ligumia subrostrata, Tritogonia cf. verrucosa,
Quadrula sp., Lampsilis teres, and Fusconaia askewi. A 5-liter sample of collected material
submitted for macrobotanical analysis revealed only insect parts and roots (see Appendix F).
Three rocks were collected for possible lipid residue analyses and 25 other limestone rocks and
seven sandstone rocks were collected as part of a sediment sample. The burned rocks associated
with the feature were analyzed in the field and consisted of 129 specimens weighing a total of
7.8 kg.

77

Feature 13 (Block 1, Units 16 and 17; 101â116 cm bs)
Feature 13 was part of an oval-shaped pile of burned rocks that occurred in Test Units 16 and 17
within the northwest corner of Block 1 underneath Feature 11 (Figure 21). Despite its occurrence
only 10 cm below Feature 11, Feature 13 was regarded as a distinctly different feature because of
a 50-cm lateral shift to the west in the concentration of stones and the occurrence of a separate
expansive scatter of rock documented in Level 11 that reflected an earlier occupation in this area.
The rocks present in Levels 11 and 12 extended into the west sidewall of Block 1, which
prevented complete delineation of the size of the feature.
Figure

21.

Figure 21. Photograph of Feature 13, Block 1; photographer is facing west.

No basin or pit was discerned during excavation or in the profile of this feature, but there was a
distinct contraction in the horizontal distribution of rocks in the deeper level, so a pit might have
been present. However, the surrounding matrix was not discolored, and rocks occurred
throughout the matrix, which indicated that if a pit were present, the stones were in the fill and
78

not lining the base. Alternatively, these may be piled discard rocks that were dumped into a
depression. These burned limestone rocks occurred in an area measuring 111 cm (north-south)
by at least 63 cm (east-west) and were recovered from 101â116 cm bs for a maximum thickness
of 15 cm. The rocks were noted in three to four layers or elevations, which also indicated some
depth to the feature. For the most part, larger rocks occurred along the northern end of the feature
in Level 11, which was directly over the concentration of rocks in Level 12; the smaller rocks to
the south were believed to be a broadcast scatter of rocks on the occupation surface.
Artifacts associated with Feature 13 include eight flakes (one secondary, six tertiary, and one
retaining cortex on the platform alone), 3.1 g of charcoal, and snail shell. Eighteen mussel shells
and mussel shell fragments were also recovered; these included Amblema plicata, Tritogonia cf.
verrucosa, Plectomerus dombeyanus. In addition, 12 sandstone cobbles were collected for
possible lipid residue analysis and 221 pieces (11,527 g) of rock were collected as part of soil
samples. Another 22.0 kg of burned rocks from the feature were analyzed and left in the field.
Two sediment samples (Lot 405/FS 464 and Lot 423/FS 484) from the east halves of Units 16
and 17, associated with Feature 13, were submitted for flotation to recover macrobotanical
remains (see Appendix F). The combined prefloated samples measured 8.5 g and were from
110â120 cm bs of Block 1. They yielded moderate amounts (40 ml; 6.5 g) of plant remains,
composed mostly of modern roots and some snails. A small amount (0.5 g) of charred plant
remains obtained from Lot 423/FS 484 measured only 3.5 liters before processing; no charred
remains came from the other 5.0-liter sample.
Three macrobotanical pieces were large enough to conduct charred wood cell structural analysis
for species identification. One was determined to be Juglandaceae (hickory type; <0.1 g), another
was Quercus (oak; 0.2 g), and a third specimen was an unidentifiable species (0.3 g). The two
recognized tree species are comparable to modern species in the region. None of the burned
botanical pieces represented parts of plants from an annual. None of the charred plant parts from
the 10 liters of sediments provided insights into the prehistoric subsistence economies or specific
activities associated with this thermal feature.
The small piece of Quercus or oak wood charcoal weighing 0.1 g was recovered from the
flotation sample (Lot 423/FS 484) from Level 12 (110â120 cm bs) in the eastern half of Test Unit
17 and directly associated with Feature 13. The resulting uncorrected radiocarbon date is 1360 Â±
40 B.P. (Beta-213094) with a 13C/12C value of -25.3 â° that yields a conventional radiocarbon date
of 1360 Â± 40 B.P. The 2-sigma calibration date for this sample is cal A.D. 630 to 710 or cal B.P.
1320 to 1240. The date is relatively contemporaneous with the two radiocarbon dates from
Features 16 and 17 in nearby Block 3 and is regarded as a reliable date for the cultural component
associated with the rock features in Block 1.
Lipid analysis was conducted from a single rock from Feature 13. The specimen (Lot 421) came
from the westcentral edge of Unit 17, Level 11 (103â110 cm bs). The lipid results (6GM 2)
indicated residues with an extremely high fat content, which possibly suggests oily remains from
seeds, nuts, or rendered fats from non-large herbivore mammals. Based on the C18:1 isomers,
the remains were more likely from plants, although the specific plant(s) were not identified.

79

Features from Block 2

Feature 3 (Block 2, Units 4 and 20; 175â192 cm bs)
Feature 3 consisted of an occupation zone of scattered burned rock that initially appeared at the
south end of Trench 22 within Unit 4 as an occupation zone located from 175â192 cm bs.
Initially (at roughly 175 cm bs), the feature was a widely dispersed scatter of burned rock with
ashy matrix and charcoal flecking throughout the unit and the floor of the adjacent trench;
however, by 180â190 cm bs, the rocks became more organized and were tightly clustered in the
southeastern corner of Unit 4 (Figure 22). Since the distribution of rocks on the upper level did
not provide data on the compaction in the lower levels, and the ashy matrix occurred uniformly
both within and outside the rock cluster, it is uncertain whether multiple occupation surfaces with
different rock functions were present, or if the cluster of rocks occurred in a lower pit-like feature.
Based on these materials and especially the presence of a thick ashy zone with charcoal flecking,
Block 2 was established south and east of the occupation zone, and additional features were
encountered in the expanded block.

The initial large, amorphous scatter of burned rocks at 175â180 cm bs may represent the discard
of rocks on a living surface; its dimensions were not fully ascertained since rocks clearly
extended into the walls of the unit, and some of the scattered rocks exposed later in Block 2 may
be from the same event. Based on the lack of a clear cluster, it appeared that the burned rocks
had been kicked around and scattered. The source feature of this rock scatter is unknown.
Between 180â192 cm, the rocks became concentrated in the southeastern corner of Unit 4. At
least 28 distinct cobbles were clustered in an area measuring 55 cm (east-west) by at least 30 cm
(north-south) and 12 cm thick, with the feature extending into the southern edge of the unit. If the
materials were not associated with an upper living surface scatter, then these rocks might be a
small rake-off mound or concentration of burned stones derived from an adjacent rock-filled pit,
Feature 12, located immediately to the south and occurring at depths of 190â200 cm bs.
Materials recovered from Feature 3 include 37 pieces (8.6 g) of bone (fish, turtle, and deer-sized
mammal), 35 g of burned clay daub, and 485 pieces (approximately 14.4 kg) of burned limestone.
In addition, 140 fragments of freshwater mussel shell were recovered including Quadrula
pustulosa mortoni, Amblema plicata, and Lampsilis hydiana. Seven sediment samples were
collected and processed by GMI using waterscreen methods; a total of 3.7 g of charcoal and some
of the burned clay were recovered.

Feature 12 (Block 2, Unit 20; 182â198 cm bs)
Feature 12 was a circular, basin-shaped, pit hearth or small roasting pit that contained a
predominance of burned rock along the upper rim and occasional stone occurring inside the
hearth feature matrix (Figure 23). It was immediately south of Feature 3 in Test Unit 20 of Block
2, north of the relic channel of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River.
The burned rock associated with Feature 12 formed a circular outline and sloped toward the inner
part of the hearth. It had a matrix of silty clay with a relatively high quantity of charcoal,
although it occurred within the upper part of the thick, ashy, and daub-laden matrix found
throughout Block 2. The pit orifice of Feature 12 measured 72 cm in diameter and the burned
rock occurred from 182â198 cm bs for a total depth of 16 cm. This feature was generally below
the level of the burned rocks representing adjacent Feature 3, which may be the discard from this
hearth or roasting pit.
No chipped stone was recovered during excavation of this feature. A number of chunks of
charcoal totaling 9.6 g were piece-plotted and collected, and a charcoal-laden sediment sample
weighing 321 g was specifically collected for extracting carbon for dating. A total of 22.6 g of
baked clay was also collected. Four bags of sediment were collected for waterscreening. Five
rocks were collected for lipid samples. The 257 burned rocks from the feature weighed roughly
12.9 kg. This feature was completely excavated.
Two sediment samples (Lot 464/FS 470 and Lot 465/FS 471) from the east and west halves of
Feature 12 were submitted for macrobotanical flotation to recover remains (see Appendix F).
They came from depths of 190â200 cm bs in Block 2. The 10 liters of sediments yielded
moderate amounts of remains, consisting of 38 ml (5.8 g) of plant remains. Analysis indicated
that most was modern rootlets, although 2.5 g of charcoal wood was also recovered. Analysis of
charred cell structure of wood on six of the larger specimens indicated that half the sample

consisted of unidentified species of wood. Two pieces of Juglandaceae (hickory type) was
present, as was a single specimen of Quercus (oak). Individual samples of wood charcoal ranged
from <0.1 g to 1.2 g in weight. The identified tree species were comparable to modern species in
the region. None of the burned botanical pieces represented parts of plants from an annual,
although one twig likely represented growth close to the age of wood procurement. The twig
sample was submitted for radiocarbon dating. None of the charred plant parts provided insights
into the prehistoric subsistence economies or specific activities associated with this thermal
feature.
The small twig of unidentified wood charcoal, weighing 0.2 g, was recovered from the flotation
sample (Lot 464/FS 470) from the small basin-shaped rock-lined hearth, Feature 12. The sample
was recovered from Level 20 (190â198 cm bs) in the eastern half of Test Unit 20. The resulting
uncorrected radiocarbon date is 1420 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213093) with a 13C/12C value of -28.4 â°
and yields a conventional radiocarbon date of 1360 Â± 40 B.P. The 2-sigma calibration date for
this sample is cal A.D. 630 to 710 or cal B.P. 1320 to 1240. The date is contemporaneous with all
three other radiocarbon dates from Block 2. It is regarded as a reliable date for the cultural
component associated with the rock features and thick ashy zone in Block 2.
Lipid analysis was conducted from a single rock from Feature 12. The specimen (Lot 468) came
from the southeast quarter of Unit 20, Level 20 (196â198 cm bs). The lipid results (6GM 3)
indicated a medium fat content, possibly signifying residues from mesquite beans, cholla cactus
fruits, or perhaps fish. Based on the C18:1 isomers, the remains were more likely from plants,
although the specific kinds of resources were not identified.
82

Feature 20 (Block 2, Units 21, 22, 24, and 25; 196â204 cm bs).
Feature 20 was a small hearth associated with a small, tight cluster of burned rocks at the
intersection of Units 21, 22, 24, and 25 in the northeast corner of Block 2 (Figure 24). This
hearth was noted mostly for the concentration of seven limestone cobbles measuring about 8â15
cm in diameter that were tightly clustered in an area 50 cm in diameter, at a depth of 196â204 cm
bs. Beneath the 8-cm-thick single layer of rock was a faint red oxidized layer under three of the
rocks on the west side of the feature, which suggested that the rocks had been heated in place.
Most likely, this was a small hearth used to heat stones for some unknown activity that might
have involved stone cooking, plant or animal resource processing, or tasks involving prolonged
heat radiation. A piece of freshwater mussel shell was found with the rocks.

No artifacts were directly associated with this feature. A small sample (6.8 g) of charcoal and
sediments was collected for dating. Five of the rocks were collected for possible lipid analysis.
An additional 0.2 g of charcoal and 4.4 g of baked clay were recovered from sediment samples
screened in the laboratory. There was a total of 141 rocks from the feature weighing 3.5 kg.
Two sediment samples (Lot 487/FS 618 and Lot 499/FS 619) retrieved from 200â210 cm bs in
Test Unit 22 and directly from Feature 20 were submitted for macrobotanical flotation to recover
remains (see Appendix F). The 10 liters of sediment yielded moderate amounts (47 ml; 6.5 g) of
botanical remains, but most of it consisted of unburned rootlets and moderate to high quantities of
land snails. Only about 0.3 g of charred wood was recovered from the 10 liters of sediment
83

sample. Analysis of charred wood cell structure of four specimens indicated that two were
unidentified species of wood, one was Juglandaceae (hickory type; 0.1g), and the other was
Quercus (oak; 0.2 g). Individual weights of wood charcoal ranged from <0.1 g to 0.2 g. The tree
species are comparable to modern species in the region. The oak specimen was submitted for
radiocarbon dating. None of the charred plant parts provided insights into the prehistoric
subsistence economies or specific activities associated with this thermal feature.
The small piece of Quercus or oak wood charcoal weighing 0.2 g was recovered from the
flotation sample (Lot 487/FS 618) associated with the small cluster designated as Feature 20.
This flotation sample was recovered from Level 20 (200â210 cm bs) of Test Unit 22. The sample
was submitted to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon dating. The resulting uncorrected radiocarbon
date is 1600 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213096) with a 13C/12C value of -26.7 â° that yields a conventional
radiocarbon date of 1570 Â± 40 B.P. The 2-sigma calibration for this sample is cal A.D. 410 to 580
or B.P. 1540 to 1360. The date is about 120 years earlier than the radiocarbon date collected from
the base of the general ashy area and of Block 2 (Beta-213097), even though the feature is clearly
within the ashy zone. Thus, this date is stratigraphically incongruent and slightly earlier than
expected, based on three other dates from Block 2 area. Overall, the magnitude of the difference
is not great relative to the known cultural sequences developed for the region.
Lipid analysis was conducted from a single rock from Feature 20. The specimen (Lot 557) came
from the northwest quarter of Unit 25, Level 21 (198â203 cm bs). The lipid results (6GM 4)
indicated similarities to residues derived from a large herbivore mixed with plant remains or, less
likely, the bone marrow residues from a large herbivore. Although the specific species was
uncertain, the results were compatible to residues derived from bison, deer, javelina, and perhaps
sotol.

Features from Block 3

Feature 14 (Block 3, Unit 38; 95â117 cm bs)
Feature 14 was a dense burned rock feature partially exposed within the west half of Test Unit 38
in the extreme northwest corner of Block 3 (Figure 25). Feature 14 continued mostly into the
west and perhaps into the north walls of this unit and beyond the limits of the block. The rocks of
this feature were distinct from those in Feature 15, located some 50â60 cm to the east.
Feature 14 was a massive layer of burned rock, mostly lying flat in three to four noncontiguous
tiers of sediments, that extended 80 cm (north-south) by at least 50 cm (east-west) at a depth
between 95â117 cm bs. Based on the curvature of the dense rock cluster, slightly less than onehalf of this feature has been exposed. The entire feature may represent a circular concentration of
stones that measured about 100 cm in diameter, and the three to four tiers of stone were at least
22 cm thick. The presence of sediments separating the clasts suggested that all may not have
been deposited in a single instantaneous event, but might have accumulated at this spot. The
profile did not indicate that the rocks were sloping into a pit feature, so the function of these
burned stones is unknown. Possibly, they represented a pile or heap of sediments and burned
rocks that might have been pulled from the deep pit Feature 17, located to the south, or perhaps
represented a rake-off area or dump event, albeit a large one.

No artifacts were observed in association with this rock cluster during excavation. However, five
sediment samples collected for waterscreening yielded one small secondary flake, and 21 mussel
shell fragments. Five rocks were saved for lipid residue studies. Approximately 257 burned
rocks (13.9 kg) were analyzed in the field or collected for analysis. All of the rock, with the
exception of 15 pieces of sandstone, was recorded as limestone.

Feature 15 (Block 3, Units 33 and 38; 93â119 cm bs)
The burned rocks from Feature 15 completely covered the area of Test Unit 33 and the eastern
quarter of Test Unit 38 to the west in the northern edge of Block 3; based on the density and
limits of the feature, the rocks also extended beyond the excavation limits to the north and east
(Figure 26). Feature 15 was a 26-cm-thick amorphous cluster of burned rock that measured at
least 120 cm (east-west) by more than 85 cm (north-south). In profile, the rocks were on a
relatively flat basal surface, two to three layers thick, and varied from stacked elements without
intervening sediments to areas of the feature well separated by fine sediments. The presence of
sediments between rocks suggested that they might represent a 26-cm-tall heap of burned rock
and sediments, perhaps, like those present in adjacent Features 14 and 16, discard residues and
dumps from a very large main rock pit, Feature 17, located along the south edge of Block 3.
Two small tertiary flakes and a possible Trinity dart point were recovered from this feature, along
with 23 pieces of freshwater mussel shell including Quadrula sp., Tritogonia verrucosa, and
Amblema plicata. No charcoal was recovered during the excavations. Eight rocks were
originally collected for lipid analysis. Altogether, the rocks attributed to Feature 15 totaled 520
and weighed about 24.3 kg.

Feature 16 (Block 3, Units 32, 26, and 37; 103â117 cm bs)
Feature 16 was a very large and complex accumulation of burned rock partially exposed in three
test units (32, 36, and 37) making up the eastern wall of Block 3 (Figure 27). Most of the rocks
extended east of the block, so the actual configuration of the rocks was uncertain. In plan view,
the rocks appeared to expand as lobes into the southeast corner of Unit 37 toward the south and
covered almost all of the floor surface of Unit 32 in the north, but in intermediate Unit 36, they
only extended some 20 cm from the edge of the block. Thus, in plan view, the rocks were
concentrated in an area measuring more than 3 m (north-south) by more than 20 to 112 cm (eastwest). In profile, the rocks were jumbled in a 14-cm-thick zone that had sediments separating the
rock clasts in some areas and rock-on-rock contact in other areas. Some of the relatively tabular
rocks were sloping, but there was no consistency in the direction or steepness of angles. Overall,
this feature appeared to be a long, linear dump heap of sediments and burned rock that
surrounded a large pit oven, Feature 17.
Associated materials include three flakes, one edge-modified flake, 0.8 g of baked clay, charcoal,
and 151 pieces of freshwater mussel shell including Amblema plicata, Fusconaia askewi,
Tritogonia verrucosa, Quadrula pustulosa mortoni, Lampsilis teres, Plectomerus dombeyanus,
and Quadrula apiculata.. Several sandstone rocks were plotted on maps and saved for possible
lipid studies. A total of 1,485 burned rocks weighing 85.9 kg was recorded in association with
Feature 16.

Two sediment samples from 110â120 cm bs in Unit 36 and 100â110 cm bs in Unit 32, were
collected from the debris discard ring, Feature 16, and submitted for flotation to recover
macrobotanical remains (see Appendix F). One 5-liter sediment sample yielded a small amount
(15 ml; 3.9 g) of botanical remains, but all of it consisted of unburned rootlets and land snails.
No burned wood, seeds, or other prehistoric macrobotanical remains were found. The second
sample was from 100â110 cm bs in Unit 32. This 5-liter sediment sample also yielded small
amounts (22 ml; 2.3 g) of organic remains. Most consisted of rootlets, insect parts, and < 0.1 g
charred materials. The charred remains were composed of five pieces of unidentified wood and
three twig fragments from unidentified tree species. The recovery of only charred wood species
from these two samples indicated that no useful data on prehistoric subsistence economies or
specific activities were derived from these sediment samples from the discard debris ring.
A small, unidentifiable twig of wood charcoal weighing <0.1 g was recovered from the flotation
sample (Lot 631/FS 662) from Level 11 (100â110 cm bs) of Test Unit 32 and was directly
associated with the mounded heap of burned rock debris (Feature 16) removed from the adjacent
87

large earth oven Feature 17. The small twig very likely represented the yearâs growth and should
accurately date the cultural event that is unbiased by old wood or cross sectional problems. The
sample was submitted to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon dating. The resulting uncorrected
radiocarbon date is 1400 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213098) with a 13C/12C value of -22.2 â° that yields a
conventional radiocarbon date of 1450 Â± 40 B.P. The 2-sigma calibration for this sample is cal
A.D. 540 to 660 or cal B.P. 1410 to 1290. Even though the spatial relationship between archshaped debris ring (Feature 16) and the central pit (Feature-17) indicated that they are partially
contemporaneous, the date from Feature 16 is some 140 years earlier than that from the adjacent
central pit (Beta-213099). Assuming that either old wood or cross sectional factors have not
adversely affected the ages of these two samples, the only way to interpret them is to suggest that
the charcoal from the large earth oven pit may represent some different cooking event.
Lipid analysis was conducted from a single rock from the linear heap of rocks, Feature 16,
surrounding the large oven feature, Feature 17. The specimen (Lot 711) came from the southwest
quarter of Unit 37, Level 12 (106.5â115 cm bs). The lipid results (6GM 6) indicated a high fat
content, possibly suggesting residues from seeds or nuts. The specific plant(s) processed in the
feature were not identified.

Feature 17 (Block 3, Units 34, 35, S30, S31, SW36, and W37; 108â129 cm bs)
Feature 17 was a very large and moderately deep basin-shaped pit with jumbles of burned rock
present within 30 cm of the walls and floor, but only fine sediments without rocks in the middle
or upper parts of the pit (Figure 28). Feature 17 was centered in Units 34 and 35, but part of the
orifice extended into the south half of Units 30 and 31, the southwest edge of Unit 36, and the
west edge of 37. Based on the distribution of rocks, the pit measured about 2.54 m (north-south)
by 2.17 m (east-west) and extended from 108â129 cm below surface, for a total pit depth of
21 cm.
The base of the pit was 10â15 cm deeper than the base of the rocks in surrounding Features 14,
15, or 16, which tended to be concentric to the pit. Since the edge of these three features was
some 80â110 cm from the edge of the Feature 17 pit, there appeared to be a modest âwork areaâ
between the pit and the clusters of burned rock that likely came from Feature 17. It was also
interesting to note that whereas the tops of the dense rock of Features 14, 15, and 16 were clearly
all evident by 110 cm bs, there was virtually no rock present in the area of the pit. By all
accounts, this seemed to be an incipient earth oven feature with a modest discontinuous ring of
rock and sediment dumps about 20 cm tall surrounding the oven pit. Assuming that the burned
rock and sediments were derived from the large pit, then Feature 17 was an earth oven and not an
open-air roasting pit.
Materials associated with the oven include two secondary flakes, snail shell, three unidentifiable
bone fragments, and 0.5 g of charcoal. A total of 116 mussel shell fragments was recovered
including Ligumia subrostrata, Quadrula sp., Lampsilis teres, Amblema plicata, Plectomerus
dombeyanus, Quadrula pustulosa mortoni, and Quadrula apiculata. In addition, 10 burned
sandstone rocks were removed for lipid analysis and 13 flotation samples were taken from the
inside of the pit. The rocks from the pit analyzed in the field weighed 90.4 kg.

Two sediment samples (Lot 662/FS 680, and Lots 613, 624/FS 706, 707) totaling 8 liters were
submitted for macrobotanical flotation from the large pit oven, Feature 17 (see Appendix F). A
3-liter sample (Lot 662/FS 680) came from around rocks 110â130 cm bs from the south half of
Unit 34; and a 5-liter sample (Lots 613, 624/FS 706, 707) came from 110â120 cm bs in Units 30
and 31. The single 3-liter sample (Lot 662/FS 680) yielded only 8 ml of rootlets and 1.3 g of
snail shell. No charred remains were recovered from such a small sample. The 5-liter sediment
sample (Lots 613, 624/FS 706, 707) yielded 22 ml (2.8 g) of macrobotanical remains. The main
macrobotanical component was composed of modern roots and two pieces of charred twigs
(<0.1 g) of an indeterminate wood species. None of the charred plant parts provided insight into
the prehistoric subsistence economies, past environmental conditions, or specific activities
associated with this pit oven feature.
The small twigs of unidentified wood charcoal weighing <0.1 g from the flotation samples (Lots
613, 624/FS 706 and 707) were submitted to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon dating. The resulting
uncorrected radiocarbon date is 1340 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213099) with a 13C/12C value of -26.9 â°
that yields a conventional radiocarbon date of 1310 Â± 40 B.P. The 2-sigma calibration for this
sample is cal A.D. 650 to 780 or cal B.P. 1300 to 1170. This date is slightly more recent than the
radiocarbon date from the debris ring on the northeast part of the oven feature. Quite likely, the
date from the pit oven represents a use-episode separate from and more recent than the older
discontinuous debris ring (Feature 16) deposited on the northeast side of the large pit.

89

Lipid analysis was conducted from a single rock from the large pit feature oven, Feature 17. The
specimen (Lot 626) came from the southcentral edge of Unit 31, bottom half of Level 12 (113 to
115 cm bs). The lipid results (6GM 5) indicated an extremely high fat content, possibly residues
from seeds, nuts, or rendered fats from non-large herbivore mammals. Based on the C18:1
isomers, the remains were more likely from plants, although the specific plant(s) were not
identified.

Feature 18 (Block 3, Units 30 and 38; 117â128 cm bs)
Located in Block 3, Feature 18 was a small oval-shaped cluster of burned rock that occurred in
Test Unit 38 (northwest portion of Block 3) but at a depth below and distinct from burned rock
dump Features 14, 15, 16, and the orifice of pit Feature 17 (Figure 29). Spatially, Feature 18 was
in the âwork zone areaâ rock void between the Feature 17 earth oven and Feature 14 dump pile to
the north. The main portion of Feature 18 consisted of only 14 rocks confined to an area
measuring 36 cm (north-south) by about 52 cm (east-west) and occurring at a depth from 117â
128 cm. Profile of this 11-cm-thick zone of burned rocks showed several rocks sloping at various
angles, and in a few places, one rock resting on top of another. The sloping rocks might simply
reflect some bioturbation or the settling of stones in old tree root cavities. Unless these rocks
were in a small pit or depression, they likely represented different and earlier activities from those
responsible for the incipient earth oven and surrounding dump piles. No sediment staining,
oxidation, or charcoal flecking was observed near the rocks. Its function is unknown. Two small
flakes, one tertiary and one secondary, were recovered in this area as well as 48 mussel shell
fragments including Amblema plicata, Plectomerus dombeyanus, and Quadrula pustulosa
mortoni. Two sediment samples were collected from the feature, and the total number of rock
collected from Feature 18 was 137 (5.6 kg).

MATERIAL OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE

Lithic Materials
Lithic analysis provides information about site function, technology and production, lithic source
procurement (exchange/interaction), and cultural affiliation based on the presence of diagnostic
stone tool types. In order to address these diverse issues, stone materials were initially separated
into five main classes: (1) chipped stone tools, (2) chipped stone debitage, (3) cores, (4) ground,
pecked, and battered stone artifacts, and (5) unworked lithics (fire-cracked/burned rock and
manuports).
Acquisition of siliceous lithic materials generally comes from a primary geological source or
from secondary alluvial sources in which the materials are available as water-worn cobbles of
various sizes, degrees of weathering, and surface wear, and from geological sources within the
drainage area. Quarried material as well as cobble usage from local alluvial deposits can be
determined through examination of chipped decortication debris. Quarried material retains
evidence of weathered cortex, while cobble and gravel-derived material shows stream wear on the
exterior cortex. These distinctive surfaces are present on the dorsal faces of decortication debris
and bifacial items on which least some of the original exterior surface of the source material
remains. This evidence provides basic information on the nature of local extraction activities.

Lithic materials are acquired, shaped into functional tools, used, and modified until final discard
through a process of progressive reduction in bulk and form. This process normally proceeds
through a series of definable stages that leave their own identifiable patterns. Use of cobbles
from alluvial deposits does not ordinarily leave archeological evidence of its practice in the form
of exploitation traces in streambeds, but is evident from the stream wear on the preserved cobble
surface of chipping debris and other artifacts. Initial stage lithic reduction activity is thus
indicated by the production of portable lithic items for later reduction as needed, leaving behind
primarily decortication debitage, shattered stone from flaws or removal of chunks of cortex, and
only a few more-finished items.
Further reduction into thinner bifaces and other usable items results in numerous interior flakes
lacking cortex or stream wear as well as some biface thinning flakes and discarded cores. Some
items are placed into use as simple unifacial or bifacial tools without more specialized flaking, for
such activities as digging, chopping, and expedient scraping, while others are further refined into
more specialized items such as projectile point/knives, drills, adzes, or formal scrapers.
Production of these items results primarily in thinning flakes removed from thin bifaces or broken
tools.
Debitage analysis obviously addresses the technological activities research domain. However,
these data also apply to additional domains: the settlement pattern research domain is addressed
by discriminating between special use sites (cobble assaying areas, economic resource
procurement sites, loci where a single tool was used and sharpened, etc.) and general use or
residential sites. In examining the patterning of special use and generalized sites on the
landscape, the community pattern research domain is potentially addressed, and examination of
91

lithic material types addresses the extra-regional trade research domain. In all cases other than
the technological activities research domain, debitage data play a âsupportingâ role to additional
lines of inquiry, which again underscores the importance of a holistic approach to the analysis and
synthesis of artifact data.
A total of 233 chipped stone artifacts was recovered during test excavations at 41TR170. Of this
chipped stone material, at least 81 percent (n=188) is composed of gravel cherts and 74.2 percent
(n=173) of the chipped stone material is composed of one specific type of gravel chert source.
This most common raw material is a river-worn gravel chert that ranges in color from opaque
cream to pale tan with occasional dark speckles and a smooth, yellowish tan to reddish brown
cortex. This material is most likely Brazos/Uvalde Gravel from the Brazos River approximately
40 km to the west (Johnny Byers, Archeologist, University of North Texas, personal
communication May 18, 2007). In addition, Cretaceous gravels are available on some of the
upland ridges and major divides in the region. Other chipped stone raw materials documented in
minor amounts include chalcedonic chert, Edwards chert, undifferentiated chert, and one piece of
jasper.

Lithic Debitage
A total of 219 pieces of flintknapping debris was recovered during test excavations at 41TR170.
Biface thinning flakes represent 33.7 percent (n=74) of the debitage, and core flakes represent
17.8 percent (n=39). Flake fragments comprise 33.8 percent (n=74) of the debitage and shatter
makes up 8.6 percent (n=19). Rejuvenation flakes, blades, and potlids make up the remaining 5.2
percent of the debitage recovered from this site. No cores were identified in this assemblage.
Seventy-three percent (n=160) of this debitage was produced as a by-product of the reduction of
pale tan Brazos/Uvalde Gravel.
The distribution of debitage morphological categories indicates that a continuum of lithic
reduction stages is represented. Only 17.8 percent of the debitage recovered from this site is
made up of core flakes, though only four are primary flakes retaining cortex on the entire dorsal
surface. Among the flake fragments, 26 percent (n=19) retain portions of the cortical surface, and
again, only four are primary flakes. The moderate proportion of flakes retaining some cortex
among the core flakes and flake fragments indicates that some relatively early stage biface
reduction and preparation activities occurred onsite. As no chert raw material sources are
available locally, occupants of 41TR170 appear to have brought in initially prepared raw
materials as biface preforms and blanks, often retaining areas of cortical surface. This is
supported by the lack of cores recovered from this site. At least 75 percent of the core flakes are
composed of pale tan Brazos/Uvalde Gravel chert as are 77 percent of the flake fragments
recovered onsite.
Later stage reduction activities are even more strongly represented by the lithic assemblage
recovered during excavation at site 41TR170. Representation of biface thinning flakes surpasses
that of core reduction flakes (74:39). Over 90 percent (n=67) of the biface thinning flakes
recovered are tertiary interior flakes. In addition, 90 percent (n=66) of the biface thinning flakes
measure less than 19 mm (.75 in). This strong representation of small, thin, tertiary biface
thinning flakes is an indication that informal and formal tool production was the primary lithic
reduction activity occurring onsite. As with the core flakes and flake fragments, a great majority
of biface thinning flakes (78 percent; n=53) was made from pale tan Brazos/Uvalde Gravel chert.
92

Initially prepared biface preforms were transported to 41TR170 from areas along the Brazos
River. Further reduction of these bifaces onsite resulted in the creation of smaller discarded flake
debitage and larger flakes that were employed for expedient utilization. Reduction of the biface
blanks proceeded in this way until a bifacial tool (e.g., knife or dart point) was produced. The
presence of nine rejuvenation flakes indicates that tool maintenance as well as production was
occurring. Considering this sequence of biface reduction and the generally curatorial use of raw
material, the absence of cores amongst this assemblage is not unexpected.
Chipped Stone Tools
Perhaps the most compelling argument for late stage reduction and final tool production onsite
was revealed during analysis of the chipped stone tools. Thirteen of the 14 formal and informal
tools recovered from this site are composed of the same Brazos/Uvalde Gravel chert that is
represented among the earlier stage chipped stone materials. These tools include four projectile
points, one biface, one possible spokeshave, and eight edge-modified flake implements.
The projectile points are all regarded as dart point forms and include one small, thick specimen
classified as a probable Dallas point, one unidentifiable dart point blade, one Trinity point, and
one Yarborough point (Figure 30). All identifiable dart points are regarded as Archaic types that
were produced during the Middle and Late Archaic periods (Turner and Hester 1999:98, 190,
197). The single biface recovered during testing is a small fragment of a lateral side. The
fragmentary portion of this biface is too small to derive meaningful measurements.
The single spokeshave and eight edge-modified flakes are all of pale tan Brazos/Uvalde Gravel
chert material. The spokeshave was formed on the distal end of a large secondary flake;
therefore, it does not exhibit a steep working edge. It is referred to as a spokeshave only in the
sense that a pattern of use-wear is apparent along a concave segment of the flake edge. Five of
the edge-modified flakes are formed on tertiary flakes; all but one is larger than 19 mm in size.
Three of the edge-modified flakes were formed on secondary flakes and one on a primary flake;
these flakes measure 19â38.1 mm. All of the thin, edge-modified flakes exhibit retouch flake
scars or use wear along straight to convex edges. The working edges of these flakes are not steep,
as would be expected for scraping and other heavy-use activities. Instead, these thin flakes were
likely used as cutting and slicing tools. These kinds of implements are usually regarded as
expedient tools, but in light of the scarcity of locally available lithic resources, these implements
may have been saved and curated from one site and task to the next.
Ground Stone Tools
Two pieces of ground stone were collected from 41TR170. One of the ground stone specimens is
an amorphous piece of sandstone with a slight carbonate encrustation from the perched water
table. The evidence for use of this piece as a possible ground stone consists of a series of
striations on one face that extends under the carbonate layer. Most likely, this is the kind of
informal abrading implement used to sharpen bones or sticks. This possible ground stone tool
came from Block 1 at the south end of the site and measures 57-x-84-x-14 mm in maximum
dimension. The second ground stone fragment is a tabular sandstone piece that appears to be a
fire-cracked griddle stone. This piece was recovered from Trench 21 and only one of the original
smoothed surfaces is intact; the remainder has been broken off as a result of thermal fracturing.
Black soot is evident on the remaining smooth surface. This fractured piece measures 74-x-59-x20 mm in maximum dimension.

point (Block 1, Test Unit 13).

Burned Rock
Considerable quantities of burned rock were encountered during excavations, indeed far more
than expected for Trinity River basin sites. With an initial expectation of low frequencies of
burned rocks, excavators were asked to collect samples to characterize size, material, and
angularity, but later, much of these data were taken only in the field. Information on 8,303 pieces
of burned rock weighing just under 451 kg was recorded during testing. Another 7,980 pieces of
burned rock weighing just under 262 kg represent samples collected and weighed in the
laboratory.

Ochre
The only piece of ochre recovered from the project is an amorphous piece of red hematite no
larger than a small crumb that shows no evidence of striations, smoothing, or other forms of
modifications. Whereas this small chunk might have been broken from a natural nodule carried
to the site, there are no signs of cultural modification. Accordingly, this piece is regarded as a
natural or noncultural inclusion, although naturally occurring hematite is very rare in these
outwash sediments of Northcentral Texas.
94

Faunal Material

Bone
A total of 268 bone fragments was recovered during the excavations of 41TR170. However, the
frequencies of bone from two proveniences are artificially inflated. For example, a total of 16
fragments is listed from Test Unit 6, Level 7, but they represent a single element that was
damaged during excavation; another 26 bone fragments from Test Unit 7, Level 5, represent
excavation-damaged fragments of 10 elements from an apparently articulated deer fore leg, which
shows no evidence of modification, although carnivore gnawing is evident. The 41TR170
archeofauna produced a sizeable amount of faunal material primarily consisting of fragmented
artiodactyl remains and bivalve shell fragments. There is a signature of Bison bison at the site,
and other taxa that are represented include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), rabbits and
hares (Lepus and Sylvilagus), turtles (terrestrial and aquatic), Canis (probably dog), fish, and
hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) (Table 9, Appendix H).

A high proportion of vertebrate remains from 41TR170 exhibits weathering, which may account
for the low proportion that exhibits green fracturing because weathering tends to erode fracture
morphology. The presence of weathering suggests that many of these remains were exposed on a
relatively stable surface for an unknown period and were not rapidly buried. On the other hand,
the ratio data between the numbers of vertebrate remains (Number of Specimens [NSP])
95

compared to the Number of Identifiable Specimens (NISP) indicate that remains from the site are
not extremely fragmented compared to other sites from Texas (Figure 31, Table 10). As the
NSP:NISP ratio increases, fragment size decreases. Low NSP:NISP suggests low intensity of
fragmentation in a fauna in that the proportion of large, identifiable specimens is relatively high.
The relative infrequency of cut marks and evidence of burning on the vertebrate remains and the
fact that multiple white-tailed deer elements are relatively whole suggest that the ungulate
remains are relatively unmodified by human butchering behavior. This, however, does not mean
that the fauna are not archeological; the 41TR170 assemblage is taxonomically characteristic of
an archeological rather than a paleontological fauna in that represented taxa, with the exception of
Sigmodon hispidus, are commonly thought to have been prey for prehistoric human hunters.

Figure 31. The relationship between fragment weight and NSP:NISP for sites in Texas (see Table 10). The sample of
assemblages is small, but it demonstrates that as fragment size decreases, intensity of fragmentation
(NSP:NISP) increases. The 41TR170 fauna is in the middle of the distribution at medium intensity of
fragmentation.

Freshwater Mussel Shell
A total of 2,254 freshwater mussel shell fragments was recovered from the excavations. This
count reflects the NSP of shell, and not the NISP; in most cases, the NSP counts are inflated due
to excavation damage or postdepositional shell degradation. A reexamination of the shell
assemblage was made to gather data on the frequency of hinge or umbo fragments by specific
species of mussels as a closer examination of the NISP present in the various excavation areas.
This study determined only 192 hinge elements were present, representing Amblema plicata
(n=65; 33.8 percent), Lampsilis sp. (n=37; 19.2 percent), Quadrula sp. (n=31; 16.1 percent),
Plectomerus dombeyanus (n=22; 11.4 percent), Tritogonia verrucosa (n=16; 8.3 percent),
Ligumia subrostrata (n=15; 7.8 percent), Fusconaia askewi (n=3; 1.5 percent), and Potamilus
purpuratus (n=3; 1.5 percent).

Based on excavation results, no large discrete freshwater mussel shell dumps from single or
multiple meals were present in the investigated areas. Only six unit/level proveniences contained
more than four umbo fragments in excavation Blocks 1 and 3, and five unit/level proveniences
from Block 2. The maximum hinge number from a single level consisted of eight specimens
from Block 1, Unit 14, Level 10. Overall, the densities of freshwater mussel shell hinges per
cubic meter of occupation zone fill from the intense cultural occupation zones in Blocks 1â3,
were 14.8, 12.0, and 12.5, respectively. These low densities of umbo hinges stand in contrast to
the often-frequent occurrence of shell features at sites within the Trinity River basin, especially
along Denton Creek (Anthony and Brown 1994). The invertebrate fauna exhibit characteristics
related to human use of the remains. Shell remains from Trench 9 are burned, and 11 fragments
exhibit modification related to incision of the shells, presumably to remove portions for use in
other contexts (e.g., bead-making or tool-making). Although only a small proportion of the
remains exhibit evidence of burning and cutting (< 1 %), this likely relates to the fact that the
shellfish remains tend to be highly fragmented, in this case NSP:NISP is 11:74 (Appendix H).

Snails
Approximately 1,926 snails were obtained during the testing phase at 41TR170. Snails have
potential to be proxies for reconstructing the paleoenvironmental conditions of the site and for
providing an assessment of sediment integrity through the use of epimerization analysis or snails
of a single species from single stratigraphic proveniences.
The sample of recovered snails taken from the screen during excavations represents a very small
percentage of the snail number and diversity present in the Trinity River sediments at the site.
Snails were present in virtually all proveniences of the site. Although very abundant, they were
not systematically collected because their minute size makes them extremely susceptible to
fluvial transport in alluvial settings. This uncertainty of cultural association and the loss of
minute specimens (sometimes representing whole species) during the dry screening activities
prevents systematic study of snails except from bulk sediment samples. Only some 10 specimens
of Rabdotus snails were collected during dry screening from specific proveniences in the remote
chance that new researchers may replace the investigative efforts of the late Dr. Glen Goodfriend
in conducting sediment integrity studies using snail epimerization methods.

97

Ceramics
No evidence of prehistoric pottery was found during the excavation of 41TR170. A few small
pieces of burned clay had what appeared to be a finished, fiber-impressed surface and an irregular
bumpy paste that resembled chunks of grog. Nevertheless, in lieu of clearer evidence for the
unequivocal presence of grog temper, such as evidence of clay particles discolored from firing
environments different from that used to fire the vessel, or finished (smoothed/decorated)
surfaces on some grog particles, etc., there is no unequivocal evidence for the presence of pottery
at the site. Accordingly, all of the pieces of burned clay from the site are regarded as burned clay
daub.

Burned Clay Daub
A total of some 175 pieces of burned clay was collected during the testing phase, but the deep
ashy zone in excavation Block 2 was also mottled with abundant bits of small brown chunks of
daub that often broke up and passed through the 6.25-mm screen. The recovered pieces of daub
represent only a small portion of the daub present in this area of the site. Most of the recovered
daub is plain, although some show impressions of grass on some surfaces, and a few pieces are
large curved segments that encased sticks or poles up to a few centimeters in diameter.
Preliminary examination of the daub failed to note any pieces that were porous with fiber
inclusions, and none of the pieces appeared to have parallel alignments of twigs or other patterns
of lashings. Burned clay pellets found in isolated contexts may be incidentally burned earth from
either tree burns below surface or perhaps from isolated hearths, but in areas containing abundant
ash and daub in zones several centimeters thick over a large area, the source of daub is apt to be
from a structural feature.

Sample Analyses

Sediment Samples
A total of 148 sediment samples was collected from feature contexts and from specific quadrants
in occupations zones usually associated with the block excavations on living surfaces.
Approximately 64 bags are from direct feature context, 52 bags are from quadrant contexts, and
33 other samples are from contrasting feature contexts. Each sample constitutes one or more bags
of sediment collected in a 12-liter galvanized bucket and bagged for later processing using a
combination of flotation and waterscreening methods through fine mesh hardware cloth. Initial
processing of 12 samples by GMI staff was started by floating 5 liters of sediment, with the
volume of the remainder of the sediment samples being measured before being waterscreened.
These samples were to be used for the extraction of macrobotanical samples for economic plants
and organic remains useful for radiocarbon dating. In addition, the heavy fraction component is
apt to yield small resharpening flakes and smaller artifacts that might pass through the standard
6.25-mm mesh screens.

98

Charcoal and Macrobotanical Remains
Charcoal was present in the alluvial sediments in contextsâusually above the West Fork
paleosolâthat reflected tree-burning events and as flecks and chunks of charcoal associated with
features and occupation zones. When abundant chunks of charcoal were noted in near-surface
contexts and the concentrations of charcoal chunks extended over several adjacent levels, those
areas were regarded as noncultural episodes. Excavators were instructed not to sample those
contexts for charcoal. In contrast, charcoal found with features or in layers containing artifacts
was sought, and often these samples were point-plotted on maps and collected as discrete chunks,
or gathered as a sediment matrix in a bag. In addition, some charred remains came from flotation
and waterscreening activities.
A series of 15 sediment samples ranging from 3 to 5 liters each (71.5 liters total volume) was
submitted to Dr. Phil Dering for flotation and macrobotanical identification (see Appendix F).
These samples were directly associated with feature contexts from Blocks 1, 2, or 3, or were from
the thick ashy zone found in Block 2. Five of the 15 samples yielded no charred remains
whatsoever. The other 10 samples yielded very sparse quantities of charred remains, with only
three samples yielding more than 0.2 g per 5-liter sample. Only one of the 10 samples weighed
more than 0.6 g, and this sample (Lot 465/FS 471) weighed 1.9 g. This indicated that charcoal
was very sparse, and cooking accidents, which might have left preserved tangible evidence of
botanical remains indicative of economic activities, were not present among the sampled features.
Analysis of the recovered charred remains document that most were charred pieces of wood or
bark, but one piece resembled a fragment similar to the thin-walled nutshell from Carya/pecan.
Although very small fragments, wood was identified as being from Celtis/hackberry (one
provenience; 0.2 g), Juglandaceae/hickory (seven proveniences; <0.7 g), Quercus/oak (three
proveniences; 1.6 g), and indeterminate charred wood (10 proveniences; 2.1 g). Most of the
wood probably served as fuel used in cooking operations. Based on the analyzed samples,
macrobotanical remains have not yielded much informative data regarding the kinds of economic
resources processed at the thermal features examined in the three excavation blocks. This is not
to say that other features onsite may not have better preservation of macrobotanical remains from
cooking accidents. However, based on the level of testing, the likelihood of preserved charred
macrobotanical remains is regarded as poor. Even though 5-liter samples are adequate for the
recovery of macrobotanical remains from activities involving semipermanent occupations,
possibly larger volumes are needed to adequately sample macrobotanical remains from the
relatively brief occupations in hunter-gatherer components, as represented at 41TR170.

Radiocarbon Results from Cultural Contexts
Eight macrobotanical samples recovered from the flotation of 5-liter samples associated with
cultural feature contexts in Blocks 1-3 were submitted for AMS radiocarbon dating in order to
understand the age of the cultural features in the three excavation blocks. Samples included wood
fragments from Features 9 and 13 in Block 1, Features 16 and 17 in Block 3, and Features 12 and
20 as well as charcoal from the top and bottom of the ashy zone in Block 2. During pretreatment,
insufficient charcoal was preserved from the sample obtained from Feature 9 (Block 1), but a
humin fraction was obtained and dated; the results of the humin fraction do not reliably date the
cultural components and its results are discussed separately below.

99

Seven radiocarbon dates on solid carbon indicate that, despite the difference in depth of more
than 1 meter between Block 2 and Blocks 1 and 3, all three targeted block areas were relatively
contemporaneous (Table 11). Four AMS dates on carbon are available from Block 2. The treering calibrated ages (2 standard deviation; 95 percent confidence) range from A.D. 410â580
(Beta-213096) to A.D. 670â870 (Beta-213095). However, the earliest date from Block 2,
associated with Feature 20 within the ashy zone, is stratigraphically inconsistent with the AMS
radiocarbon date from the base of the same ashy layer at A.D. 540â660 (Beta-213097). No
independent chronometric data exist to help resolve which date is in the correct stratigraphic
context; so the age of the entire ashy zone between 190 and 220 cm bs in Block 2 could range
between A.D. 540â660 (Beta-213097) and A.D. 670â870 (Beta-213095) and. These ages indicate
that the ashy zone and both Features 12 and 20 date to the terminal Late Archaic period.

Radiocarbon data from Beta Analytic, Miami, Florida; calibrations from Stuiver et al. 1998, Radiocarbon 40:1041â1083.

Two AMS radiocarbon dates were derived from solid charcoal floated from sediments extracted
from a large pit oven (Feature 17) and a mounded arc of burned rock debris (Feature 16) that
encircled the pit oven in Block 3. The tree-ring calibrated ages (2 standard deviation; 95 percent
confidence) range from A.D. 540â660 (Beta-213098) to A.D. 650â780 (Beta-213099). Since the
more recent date is from the oven pit feature, it likely provides an age estimate of the terminal use
of the oven feature. The earlier date from the adjacent encircling linear alignment of burned rock
debris undoubtedly dates to an earlier use-event of the oven feature, since the date was derived
from a burned twig that should reflect minimal chronometric error from cross-sectional and oldwood effects. Even though the two dates from Block 3 are not contemporaneous, they occur
within the same time span as that attributed to the ashy zone found in Block 2.

100

Although two dates were processed from distinct feature contexts in Block 1, only one date was
based on solid carbon, which should reliably reflect the age of the block. This single sample
associated with Feature 13 provides a tree-ring calibrated age (2 standard deviation; 95 percent
confidence) of A.D. 630â710 (Beta-213094). Since Block 1 is located about 4 m southeast of
Block 3, and the one date falls within the temporal range ascribed to the features from Block 3,
the features in both blocks are contemporaneous. Thus, Feature 13 (Block 1) and Features 16 and
17 (Block 3) are chronometrically contemporaneous. The main excavation focus of cultural
activities encountered in Blocks 1, 2, and 3 represents cultural occupations from the terminal
Archaic period and at a maximum represents a roughly 330-year range from A.D. 540â660 to A.D.
670â870, provided that the earliest and stratigraphically inconsistent date of A.D. 410â580 is
discarded.
A single AMS radiocarbon date was based on the humin fraction of charred materials collected
from a degraded piece of unidentified wood charcoal associated with Feature 9 in Block 1. This
tree-ring calibrated (2 standard deviation; 95 percent confidence) AMS result provides an
anomalously early age of B.C. 2140â1940; B.P. 4100â3800 (Beta-213092). Dates derived from
the humin fraction are susceptible to contamination from organic acids resulting from ground
waters or pedogenic or soil formation processes. Their results typically provide ages earlier than
the target cultural event.
In this case, the resulting date on the humin fraction is some 2,470 to 3,020 years earlier than the
span attributed to the cultural components based on the other seven AMS radiocarbon dates from
cultural features. The date is also some 640 to 1,230 years earlier than the earliest geomorphic
date based on the bulk humate sediments from the basal yellow clay (Beta-205061). The humin
fraction date is some 1,520 to 1,940 years earlier than the bulk humate sediments from the base of
the West Fork paleosol (Beta-205062: see Appendix J). Perhaps some of the anomalously early
geomorphology dates obtained on bulk sediment samples from Trench 14 are related to the
elevated amounts of early humin acids present in some of these deposits.

Lipid Studies
Studies conducted in South Texas have documented the retention of lipids or fatty acids bound
inside the cores of porous burned rocks or on the surfaces of nonporous burned rocks. Extraction
and analysis of lipids can contribute information to the activities and subsistence practices of
prehistoric groups. A total of 93 pieces of burned sandstone and limestone, weighing about 61.8
kg, was targeted in the field for collection as lipid residue samples. All or nearly all are directly
from feature or excavation block contexts. During recovery, specific lipid samples were
annotated on the block excavation feature maps with a sample number, point-plotted both
horizontally and vertically, and collected so that the specific provenience for the context of
specimens could be evaluated.
Single burned rocks from each of six features (two features per block) were submitted for lipid
analysis as a trial test to determine whether fatty acids were preserved and to determine if
meaningful information could be extracted from lipid studies of burned rocks (Appendix G). The
results of this limited sample indicate that lipids are preserved on rock clasts in every burned rock
feature examined. The residue signatures for two of six samples were deemed low but sufficient
to obtain interpretable data. Three samples yielded extremely high C18:1 isomers and one
yielded high amounts of C18:1 isomers. The lipid results provide general fatty acid signature
101

classes to general plants and/or animal resources, but not the same definitive identifications as
obtained from macrobotanical remains. As such, their precision is not great for the identification
of specific resources, as is often desirable for reconstructing prehistoric resources. Interestingly,
the four samples with high (6GM 6) and extremely high (6GM 1, 2, and 5) forms of C18:1
isomers all came from features in adjacent Blocks 1 and 3 in the south end of the site. They all
suggest decomposed foods with very high fat contents (such as seed and nuts), or rendered fats
from animals other than large herbivores. However, the elevated C18:2 and long fatty acid chains
suggest that burned rock Features 9 and 13 in Block 1 and the large oven (Feature 17) and dump
ring (Feature 16) in Block 3 were likely used to cook plant remains with relatively high fat
contents.
The two other samples (6GM 3 and 4) came from features in the ashy zone of Block 2 north of
the relic channel. Recovery of lipids from these two samples was lower than the four samples
from the south edge of the site, but any effect caused by the presence of the thick ashy zone is
uncertain. The fatty acid signature from 6GM 3 (Feature 12) was indicative of mesquite, cholla,
corn, or perhaps fish, but the long chain saturated fat component suggested the use or presence of
the plant component. In light of the radiocarbon date from Feature 12 that is indicative of a
Transitional Archaic age, the presence of corn is regarded as unlikely. The lipid signature from
6GM 4 (Feature 20) was found to be consistent with that from the processing of large herbivore
(bison, deer, javelina) marrow extraction, in combination with the presence of plants such as sotol
hearts. The bones from the excavation block were predominantly of deer, and no sotol remains
have been recovered from the few flotation samples processed from the ashy zone in Block 2.

Column Samples
Three series of sediment samples, each measuring 10-x-10 cm by 5 cm thick, were collected as
columns to provide fine scale resolution (thin levels) of materials from different parts of the site.
The three columns were taken adjacent to Trench 1, Test Unit 1; Trench 19, Test Unit 4, Block 1;
and Trench 22, Test Unit 2, Block 2. The purpose of these 120 discrete samples was to obtain a
continuous column of sediments from surface to 2 m deep that might be used to systematically
extract materials such as snails for environmental reconstruction, or phytoliths, or even magnetic
susceptibility measurements that might be useful in determining occupation signatures. Only the
column sample from Trench 19 will be curated; the remaining two were screened in the
laboratory.

Historic Remains
Five historic artifacts and two pieces of concrete were recovered from four proveniences during
the excavations of the 2-m-deep test units. The historic materials consist of two pieces of aqua
glass, one piece of clear glass, one whiteware sauce rim, and one piece of corroded iron likely
from a metal can. Due to their rare occurrence, it is not possible to determine whether they
represent ephemeral activities on the floodplain or flotsam from periodic flood events. They are
not regarded as important and will be discarded.

MATERIAL DISTRIBUTION AND RESULTS FROM TRENCH MONITORING AND
DEEP TEST UNITS
This section characterizes the information available for mechanical trench monitoring that
occurred before the deep test unit excavations. Subsequent sections discuss the results of feature
and material remains from the trenches and deep test pits.

Trench Monitoring
The results of monitoring mechanical excavations and the cultural materials recovered during this
process are detailed in Table 12. Despite attempts to control monitoring of trenches and backdirt
for signs of artifacts, the thickness of the mechanical excavated levels proved to be difficult to
manage. Consequently, the general depth of materials from monitoring is less than precise.
Twelve of the 29 trenches were excavated north of the relic river channel (see Table 12). Four of
these were void of cultural material, and in the remainder, cultural materials were recovered
between 40 and 200 cm bs and consisted of burned rock, mussel shell, charcoal, one possible
griddle stone, bone, and charcoal. Three backhoe trenches (2, 3, and 4) were excavated in the
location of the relic channel. The excavation of these trenches was halted when large limestone
blocks were encountered. These blocks appear to have been placed within the old river channel
as erosion prevention measures. No artifacts were found associated with these three trenches.
Fourteen trenches were excavated south of the relic channel; three (11, 18, and 29) were void of
cultural material.
An examination of the data in Table 12 shows that cultural materials were observed during
monitoring in all but ten of the 29 backhoe trenches excavated. Those with no artifacts present
were Backhoe Trenches 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Test Unit 9 was placed at Trench 28
specifically to evaluate the lack of artifacts noted during monitoring. However, six distinct
classes of cultural material (lithics, bone, freshwater mussel shell, burned rock, charcoal, and
historic glass) were recovered during excavation of this unit. Overall, manual excavation of the
10 deep test units recovered at least five or more classes of artifacts (lithic debris, burned clay
daub, bone, freshwater mussel shell, charcoal, snail, historic artifacts, stone tools, and burned
rock). Appendix A shows the comparison of artifacts observed during monitoring with the
materials recovered during manual excavation of test units adjacent to the trenches. The least
diverse range of materials came from Test Unit 8, which yielded only charcoal, snails, and one
historic artifact during manual excavation.
Most remains observed while monitoring mechanical excavations consisted of burned rock,
followed (in decreasing amounts) by freshwater mussel shell, charcoal flecks, and bone. About
half of the burned rock clusters encountered during the manual excavations of the deep test units
were found during mechanical monitoring (cf. Feature 3, Feature 4, Feature 9), and many other
features were encountered during efforts to determine the origin of scattered rocks identified in
backhoe dump piles.

Deep Test Units
The 10 deep test units comprise about two-thirds (20.0 m3) of the total manually excavated
volume of sediments (approximately 30.80 m3) examined during the testing phase. Five test units
(Units 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10) were excavated north of the relic channel and five (Units 1, 2, 6, 7, and
8) were excavated south of the channel. Excavations in Unit 2 were terminated when cemented
Pleistocene gravels were encountered about 180 cm bs; but Test Unit 4 was dug to 210 cm bs to
capture the base of an ashy occupation zone. Test Units 2 and 4 were eventually expanded and
incorporated into Blocks 1 and 2, respectively. The materials associated with these units will be
discussed as a part of the appropriate block discussions. A summary of features recorded and
artifacts collected from the deep test units is available in Appendix B.
The deep test units yielded eight (42.1 percent) of the 19 features. They also produced 15.9
percent (n=35) of the lithic debris, 28 percent (n=4) of the chipped stone tools, four percent (12.3
g) of the burned clay, 50 percent (n=107) of the bone, and 4 percent (9.4 g) charcoal samples.
The deep units also yielded 24 percent (n=542) of the total recovered freshwater mussel shell,
seven percent (n=1,137) of the burned rock by count, and 5.1 percent (36.8 kg) of the burned rock
by weight, as well as all seven of the historic artifacts from the project assemblage. Most of the
historic artifacts came from the upper 30 cm of deposits. However, the one piece of corroded
iron (can fragment?) from 90â100 cm bs in Unit 5 is believed to be intrusiveâeither from rodents
or wall slump. No ground stone artifacts were recovered from the deep test units.

Features
Two of the eight features encountered during deep test unit excavations occurred in areas that
were subsequently expanded into Blocks 1 and 2 and will be discussed in conjunction with the
block. The other six features came from three of the 10 deep test units: Units 1, 3, and 6 located
next to Trenches 1, 23, and 25, respectively. The two features from Test Unit 3 near Trench 23,
at the extreme north end of the site, consist of a concentration of burned rocks within an
approximately 50-cm-diameter buried 115â122 cm bs (Feature 4), and a concentration of
charcoal flecks in a 60-cm area at a depth of 120â124 cm bs (Feature 5). Due to the similarity of
depths from this one unit and the proximity of the features, both might be associated with one
occupation surface. However, the lack of features found in adjacent Test Unit 24, only some 7 m
away, suggests that the features are localized. Limited information can be gained from the small
area opened at the extreme north edge of the site.
The other four features occur in Trenches 1 and 25 located about 18 m apart along the south bank
of the relic river channel. One feature, Feature 1, is a small cluster of rocks exposed in the corner
of Test Unit 1 at a depth of 84â90 cm bs. Nothing is known about this fairly recent feature.
The other three features all occur at the same general depth (Feature 2, 142â155 cm bs, Test Unit
1; Feature 7, 133â144 cm bs, Test Unit 6; and Feature 8, 149â169 cm bs, Test Unit 6). All three
features are small (roughly 22, 22, and 50 cm diameters) clusters of burned rock that are
tentatively identified as residual remains of hearth rake-off or dump events, or in situ hearths with
oxidized surfaces. Due to the paucity of associated remains, no further excavations were
regarded as being warranted here.

Material Remains

Chipped Stone
Four chipped stone tools were recovered from only one test unit; Unit 1 yielded one Dallas type
dart point, one biface fragment, one edge-modified flake, and one spokeshave. One fragment of
ground stone recovered from Unit 1 may represent a portion of a griddle stone. A total of 35
pieces (16 percent) of debitage was also recovered from Units 1, 3, 6, 9, and 10 (Table 13). In
addition to the possible Dallas type dart point, Unit 1 yielded 10 pieces of debitage. Six pieces of
debitage were recovered from Unit 3; 14 from Unit 6; one from Unit 9; and four from Unit 10.

The small possible Dallas point from Unit 1 is a nonbarbed dart point with broad side notches that
appears to have been resharpened extensively. It was recovered from 110â120 cm bs and is of
red jasper. The extreme distal tip is broken and missing. The blade edges are slightly convex and
resharpened with an alternate bevel. The shoulders are asymmetrically placed relative to the midline axis and are âweak,â rounded or unbarbed. The stem was made by the placement of wide
side notches, which produces a slightly expanding stem, whose edges are crushed but not ground.
The base is defined by rounded tangs and a convex base. The specimen is 231+ mm long, with a
138-mm shoulder width, 84-mm stem width, 92-mm base width, 58-mm thickness, and 120-mm
stem length. The overall morphology and size bear some resemblance to a Dallas point (Turner
and Hester 2001:98), which is attributed to the Late Archaic period. Although this point is small
enough to fall within the size range of many arrow points, this specimen is likely a dart point that
has been extensively resharpened, based on the stem thickness.
The edge-modified flake, spokeshave, and biface fragment recovered from Unit 1 are all of
Brazos/Uvalde Gravel. The biface appears to be a small lateral edge fragment from which little
additional information can be determined. The spokeshave was formed on the distal end of a
large secondary flake and does not exhibit a steep working edge. A pattern of use-wear is
apparent along a concave segment of the flake edge. The edge-modified flake is a large
secondary flake measuring in the 25.4â38.1 mm size range with minimal retouch along a lateral
edge.
106

Vertebrate Fauna
A total of 112 bones (41.7 percent) weighing 278.7 g came from the deep test units. Represented
among these specimens are Bison bison, bison-sized mammal, Canis sp. (dog or wolf),
Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer), turtle, Pseudemys sp. (slider or cooter), deer-sized
mammal, and medium-sized ungulate. Green fracturing was observed on deer-sized mammal and
medium-sized ungulate specimens, but cut marks were observed on white-tailed deer and
Pseudemys sp. specimens. Weathering was present on deer-sized mammal, medium-sized
ungulate, medium-sized mammal, and white-tailed deer specimens. Partial calcining was
observed on one turtle specimen and three unidentified specimens.

Invertebrate Fauna
Freshwater mussel shell fragments (n=346; 15.4 percent) were recovered from the deep test units
and trenches. Seventeen of the fragments retained hinges or umbos to enable species level
identification (Table 14). One of the unidentified mussel shell fragments from Trench 22 shows
damage near the posterior ridge, and several of the unidentified fragments from Trench 9 are
burned.

Additional Materials and Samples
Thirty-one pieces (33.1 percent of the site assemblage) of burned clay came from four of the
units. A total of 31 samples of charcoal was collected from nine units. Burned rock recorded
from Test Units 1â10, excluding Units 2 and 4, accounted for 6.3 percent (n=1,040) of the total
41TR170 burned rock count and 3.9 percent (28.2 kg) by weight. Limestone was by far the most
abundant rock type used; it accounted for 94.8 percent of the total burned rock by weight.
Sandstone and quartzite were also present in minor amounts.

107

MATERIAL DISTRIBUTION AND RESULTS: BLOCK UNIT EXCAVATIONS
The three block excavations comprised about 12.1 m3 or a little more than one-third of the total
32.2 m3 volume of sediments manually excavated during the testing phase. Blocks 1 and 3 were
placed close to each other near Trench 19 about 140 m south of the relic channel next to the edge
of the Pleistocene gravel bar at the south edge of the site to examine an large area of burned rock
buried about 1 m deep. The features exposed in Blocks 1 and 3 occurred at the base of the West
Fork paleosol, and the recovery a single Yarborough dart point in each of these blocks suggests
that they are Late Archaic occupations. Block 2 was placed about 70 m north of the relic channel
and was used to examine a zone of ash, daub, rocks, and artifacts that appeared nearly 2 m deep.
Despite much greater depth, it too appeared beneath the West Fork paleosol, and the recovery of
an unidentified dart point suggests that it is also an Archaic component. A series of seven AMS
radiocarbon dates run on macrobotanical remains recovered by flotation methods from cultural
feature contexts indicated that the cultural activities in all three excavation blocks were relatively
contemporaneous and occurred within the period A.D. 540â870. Due to the proximity of Blocks 1
and 3, they are discussed sequentially, followed by the results from Block 2.

Block 1
Block 1 consisted of the placement of eight full 1-x-1-m blocks, and two 1-x-.5-m test units
adjacent to Deep Test Unit 2 in order to examine a number of burned rock features in the south
edge of the site. The following describes the features that occurred between 90 and 130 cm bs in
this 10 m2 area. The volume of fill excavated from the new test units in Block 1 was 3.6 m3,
which along with the fill examined from the deep unit testing brings the total volume for Block 1
to 4.0 m3. This represents about 12.4 percent of the manually excavated fill from this project.

Features
Five burned rock features in Block 1 represent a diversity of feature types (Figure 32). As
discussed above, they include two shallow, rock-filled basin pit features, each about 1 m in
diameter (Feature 9, Feature 13); an elongated cluster of large burned rocks believed to be a stock
pile culled from earlier features and possibly intended for recycling into other features (Feature
6); a large area of stones fitted together to form a flat surface that might be a griddle-like feature
(Feature 10); and a possible dump or rake-off pile (Feature 11). All are exterior cooking or small
oven features that may likely have been used in baking or roasting forms of cooking. The
occurrence of Feature 13 beneath the level of the other features suggests that multiple
components are likely present. This interpretation is also hinted at by the vertical distribution of
artifacts from this block (Appendix C).
Four sediment samples totaling 20 liters were processed for macrobotanical remains from
Features 9, 11 and 13; however only one sample associated with Feature 13 yielded
macrobotanical remains, which were only <0.6 g of charred wood that was identified as Quercus,
Juglandaceae, and indeterminate types. Part of this identified charcoal sample from Feature 13
was submitted for radiocarbon dating. It yielded an uncorrected date of 1360 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta213094) and provided a 2-standard-deviation calibrated age of A.D. 630â710. A second sample
not identified by a paleobotanist was selected from field samples collected by excavators from
Feature 9. This sample did not survive pretreatment intact, but dating of the humin acid yielded

an uncorrected date of 3,640 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213092) and provided a 2-standard-deviation
calibrated age of B.C. 2140 to 1940. The latter date does not provide an accurate age for Feature 9
and is earlier than the radiocarbon date from the yellow clay basal deposits at the site. The date
from Feature 13 is temporally consistent with the stratigraphic context and with dates from
features in the adjacent Block 3 area.

Material Remains
The artifacts from Block 1 are moderately abundant for this and other sites in the Trinity River
valley, although the assemblage is apt to be judged as meager in relation to the abundance of
remains from Central Texas or other areas closer to chert resources. Although the volume of
sediments examined in Block 1 constitutes about one-tenth of the total amount excavated, the
area yielded over two-thirds of the flake debris, half of the stone tools, and a third of all
freshwater mussel shell and burned rock documented during the testing phase. However, no
animal bone and only five small pieces of burned clay were recovered, and organic remains were
represented by one-twentieth of the amount from the entire testing phase.

Chipped Stone
Stone tools from Block 1 consist of six edge-modified flakes, one Yarborough dart point, and one
possible ground stone abrading implement. Of the 219 total flakes, 158 (72.1 percent) were
found in this area. All of the chipped stone tools and 75.4 percent of the chipped stone debitage
from Block 1 are Brazos/Uvalde Gravel chert.
The dart point recovered from Unit 14, Level 13 (120â130 cm bs), in Block 1 is a medium to
large refined dart point base with prominent, unbarbed shoulders and a straight base (see Figure
30). It is of tan Brazos/Uvalde Gravel chert. The specimen is symmetrically biconvex, and the
stem is aligned with the blade axis. The entire tip and distal blade are missing. The blade edges
are convex, with one edge relatively uniform and the other undulating. The proximal blade edges
are nearly parallel and straight. Shoulders are well defined, prominent, and unbarbed. The stem
is slightly expanding and meets the straight base in sharply pointed tangs. The original unbroken
specimen was much longer than the remaining 358+ mm. It has a 238-mm shoulder width, 139mm stem width, 171-mm base width, 81-mm blade thickness, and 159-mm stem length. The
morphology compares favorably to the Yarborough type, which was made during the Archaic
period and into the Late Archaic (Turner and Hester 1999:197).
The six edge-modified flakes recovered from Block 1 are all of pale tan Brazos/Uvalde Gravel
chert. Four of the edge-modified flakes are tertiary flakes; one measures in the 6.4â12.7-mm
range, another in the 19â25.4-mm range, and two in the 25.4â38.1-mm range. The last two edgemodified flakes are a primary flake and a secondary flake, both measuring in the 25.4â38.1-mm
range. Considering the lack of a steep working edge, none of the six edge-modified flakes was
selected for durability. These flakes were not intended for wood or bone working, nor for hide
processing; it is more likely that these items were intended for use as cutting implements for meat
or vegetation.

110

The chipped stone debitage consists of 55 biface thinning flakes, 27 core flakes, 53 flake
fragments, 14 pieces of shatter, one potlid, and eight rejuvenation flakes (Figure 33). Fifty of the
biface thinning flakes are tertiary flakes, and only five are secondary (Table 15). Forty-nine of
the biface thinning flakes are smaller than 19 mm, and only six are between 19 mm and 38.1 mm.
Of the 27 core flakes, two are primary, 19 are secondary, and six have cortex on the platform only
(see Table 15). Eighteen core flakes measure smaller than 19 mm and nine measure between
19 mm and 38.1 mm. Of the 53 flake fragments, two are primary, eight are secondary, and 43 are
tertiary. This distribution of chipped stone, particularly the dominance of biface thinning flakes
and tertiary flake fragments, demonstrates that stone tool manufacture, use, and rejuvenation were
the primary lithic technological activities represented in the Block 1 area.

Invertebrate Fauna
Among the site assemblage, a total of 771 (34 percent) freshwater mussel shell fragments was
recovered from Block 1 excavation contexts. Sixty-three of these specimens retain hinges or
umbos allowing for species-level identification; the remaining 708 fragments were unidentifiable
(Table 16). One Lampsilis sp. specimen was modified by a rectilinear excision from near the
posterior ridge.

Additional Materials and Samples
About 8,064 burned rocks weighing 297.2 kg were documented from this block. Limestone
accounts for 86.8 percent of the rock from Block 1 by weight, sandstone accounts for 12.3
percent, and conglomerate 0.7 percent. A total of 49 rocks, mostly sandstone, was point-plotted
and collected for possible lipid analysis. Single burned rocks from Features 9 and 13 were
processed for the recovery of prehistoric lipid residues. Both results (6GM 1 and 6GM 2) yielded
extremely high readings of C18:1 isomers, which are interpreted as perhaps being derived from
fatty plants, such as seeds or nuts, or perhaps rendered fats from herbivores.
Block 1 also yielded five small pieces of unimpressed burned clay, six charcoal samples, and one
very small piece of unmodified red hematite ocher.

Block 3
This block was placed next to exploratory Trench 29 dug to ascertain the extent of burned rock in
the areas north of Trench 19 and Block 1. Block 3 is not contiguous with Block 1, but is located
about 4 m to the northeast. A total of nine 1-x-1-m units was dug to explore the density and
diversity of burned rock features along the south edge of the site. Altogether, about 4.0 m3 of
sediments were excavated from this block and represent 12.4 percent of the total volume
manually dug during this testing phase project.

Features
Five more feature numbers were assigned to discrete dump piles or rock-filled depressions
(Figure 34). Overall, it seems that Features 14, 15, and 16 reflect relatively discrete low (15â
20 cm tall) mounds or dumps of burned rock and sediments derived from the adjacent large
burned-rockâfilled pit. The Feature 17 rock pit is likely an incipient burned rock oven feature,
but it is more than double the size and volume of the two possible pits found in Block 1. The

rock dump piles are concentric to the pit but are located about 80 cm away from the edge of the
depression. This intervening area is an activity zone around the rim of the pit. The bases of the
rock mounds are about the same elevation as the rim of the pit.
In contrast, Feature 18 is a small cluster of burned rock that occurred at a greater depth than the
features comprising the burned rock mounds and incipient earth oven. Unless these rocks
occurred in a pit, the feature elevation provides tantalizing evidence for multiple stratified
occupations in this area.
Four sediment samples totaling 18 liters were processed for macrobotanical remains from
Features 16 and 17; however only one sample associated with each feature yielded <0.2 g of
macrobotanical remains, identified as indeterminate wood type. Charcoal from Feature 16 was
submitted for radiocarbon dating. It yielded an uncorrected date of 1400 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213098)
and provided a 2-standard-deviation calibrated age of A.D. 540â660. A second charcoal sample
from Feature 17 yielded an uncorrected date of 1340 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213099) and provided a 2standard-deviation calibrated age of A.D. 650â780. These dates are temporally consistent with
the stratigraphic context and with dates from features in the adjacent Block 1 area.

Material Remains
The artifacts associated with Block 3 were very sparse and contrast markedly to the quantity of
remains from Block 1, located only a few meters away. The low densities of remains are likely
the result of excavations focusing on the features relating to a single activity and the presence of
the exceptionally large oven feature and incipient dump ring with little sampling in peripheral
areas where processing activities may have taken place. The most abundant class of materials is
the burned rock. About half of all the burned rock from the entire testing phase came from this
block. Other remains were rarely found. Only one-fifth of the recovered freshwater mussel shell
came from here, but tools and debitage constitute about one-tenth of the assemblage; charcoal
samples and snails are represented by only some five percent. Burned clay daub and bone are
represented by about one percent of the total testing assemblage. No ground stone or historic
artifacts were found.

Chipped Stone
The stone tools from Block 3 consist only of one Axtell or Trinity dart point and one edgemodified flake; these two artifacts represent about 14 percent of the 14 recognized tools from the
site. Both tools are from the Brazos/Uvalde Gravel chert source.
The dart point recovered from Block 3, Unit 33, at a depth 113 cm bs is of tan gravel chert
material that does not clearly exhibit heat treatment (see Figure 30). The projectile point is
medium to large and crudely made. The specimen is biconvex but has stacked hinge fractures on
one side that produce a thick, asymmetrical cross section, and the blade is skewed from the
orientation of the stem. The tip shows a minimal amount of excavation damage. The blade edges
are convex, with one edge relatively uniform and the other undulating. The shoulders are well
defined, prominent, and unbarbed. The stem is slightly expanding with rounded tangs that meet
the convex base. The stem seems to have been much better finished than the blade. The
specimen is 429+ mm long, with a 222-mm shoulder width, 127-mm stem width, 133-mm base
114

width, 92 mm blade thickness, and 122-mm stem length. The morphology compares favorably to
the Axtell and Trinity types, which are both Middle to Late Archaic period points (Turner and
Hester 2001:190).
The edge-modified flake recovered from Block 3 is a tertiary flake with a relatively small
working edge. It appears that it may have served a limited expedient scraping function, though it
is a utilized flake, with no apparent formal retouch. This piece measures between 19.4 and
25.4 mm.
Only 22 (10 percent) of the 219 pieces of chipped stone debitage came from Block 3 (Figure 35).
The debitage includes nine biface thinning flakes less than 19 mm in size; seven are tertiary and
two are secondary. Chipped stone from Block 3 also includes three secondary core flakes less
than 19 mm in size, seven flake fragments, one potlid, and two pieces of shatter (see Figure 35).
Fifty percent (n=11) of the chipped stone debitage is composed of pale tan Brazos/Uvalde Gravel
material. The remaining fifty-percent includes undifferentiated chert, chalcedonic chert, and
Edwards chert.

Vertebrate Fauna
Only four fragments of bone were recovered from Block 3 during testing. None of the faunal
specimens was identifiable to species, although one fragment from 110â120 cm bs in Unit 35 was
carbonized.
Invertebrate Fauna
Freshwater mussel shell is represented by some 466 fragments (20.6 percent of the site sample).
Fifty-three of the fragments retain hinges or umbos to enable species-level identification (Table
17). Seven of the mussel shells from Block 3 show modification. Two Amblema plicata shells
exhibit a rectilinear incision near the posterior ridge or ventral margin, and two others show
damage near the posterior ridge. Two unidentified shell fragments and one Plectomerus
dombeyanus specimen also show modification through a small rectilinear incision near the
posterior ridge.

Additional Materials and Samples
Burned clay daub is represented by three pieces and may have been accidentally fired hunks of
clay associated with the oven feature. Seven samples of charcoal were collected from the feature.
A total of 5,592 pieces (34.3 percent of the site sample) of burned rock was documented from this
area, and it represents about 312.2 kg (43.8 percent of the site sample) of the burned rock in the
testing site assemblage. Ninety-four percent (293.3 kg) of the rock from Block 3 by weight is
limestone, and the remainder is sandstone. Single burned rocks from Features 16 and 17 were
processed for the recovery of prehistoric lipid resides. Similar to nearby Block 1, both results
(6GM 6 and 6GM 5, respectively) yielded extremely high readings of C18:1 isomers, which are
interpreted as perhaps being derived from fatty plants such as seeds or nuts, or perhaps rendered
fats from herbivores.

Block 2
Block 2, north of the relic channel at the south end of Trench 22 and southeast of Deep Test Unit
4, was excavated in order to investigate an expansive occupation surface associated with a thick
ashy zone located about 190â220 cm bs. Nine test units were placed south and east of deep Test
Unit 4, bringing the total surface area of the block to 10 m2 and a total volume of 4.1 m3. The
manual excavations in Block 3 represent some 12.7 percent of the total controlled excavations
conducting during this testing phase project. The characteristics of the features and artifacts from
this small block contrast with those found in Blocks 1 and 3.

Features
Three burned rock features were documented in these excavations, but the entire ashy matrix in
this area is also enigmatic and warrants further comment. Feature numbers were assigned to a
small basin-shaped, rock-ringed pit hearth (Feature 12), an adjacent rake-off or dump area to the
northwest (Feature 3), and a second ephemeral hearth represented by a small cluster of stones
116

over an oxidized surface (Feature 20; Figure 36). The occurrence of the latter feature at a deeper
depth suggests that multiple components are present in this part of the site. In addition to these
formally defined features, relatively small burned rocks were widely scattered across the entire
excavation block, but they formed no discernable pattern. As such, they roughly denote an
occupation surface.
Four sediment samples were processed for macrobotanical remains from Features 12 and 20.
These generally yielded small quantities of wood charcoal ranging from 0.2 to 1.9 grams.
Identifications usually reflected Quercus, Juglandaceae, and indeterminate types. Two charcoal
samples from feature contexts were submitted for radiocarbon dating. One sample from Feature
12 yielded an uncorrected date of 1420 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213093) and provided a 2-standarddeviation calibrated age of A.D. 630â710. A second charcoal sample from Feature 20 yielded an
uncorrected date of 1600 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213096) and provided a 2-standard-deviation calibrated
age of A.D. 410â580. The latter date is stratigraphically inconsistent with a radiocarbon date on
charcoal from the base of the ashy zone.
Most intriguing was the thick ashy matrix that occurred completely across the entire 10-m2
excavation block. In contrast to the overlying and underlying strata, this 40-cm-thick zone was
characterized by grayish ashy deposits with regular densities of charcoal flecking and small
charred twig segments. No large posts were noticed. Pockets of the ashy matrix contained
concentrated pea gravel, but it is uncertain whether this represents intrusive fill from rodent
burrows or remnants of flood events near the base of the West Fork paleosol. Interestingly, some
areas of the floor surface contained high densities of fine brown daub and poorly fired burned
clay. Much of this was too friable and small to be saved, and so most was lost during screening.
However, periodic chunks of larger daub were found. Other pieces of daub retained stick
impressions, but never multiple parallel impressions in a series. One piece of daub is curved and
retains a post or small branch impression. The volume of ashy deposits spanning 40 cm in
thickness is remarkable. The fact that cultural remains and features occur throughout this zone
leads to the conclusion that it likely had a cultural origin, rather than representing a natural fire
along the creek bank. However, the basal contact of the ashy zone is abrupt without an oxidized
surface. The basal contact of the ashy zone across the 10-m2 area was scraped in an effort to
locate postholes, fire pits, or other signs of architectural features, but nothing was found. The
target occupation zone may represent a dense midden deposit and/or the remains of a very large
structure or dwelling that greatly exceeds the size of the excavation block. None of the stray
rocks in the block represents stone shims for posts or other forms of bracing for some
superstructure.
Three sediment samples from the general ashy zone were collected and submitted for flotation
analysis to extract macrobotanical remains (see Appendix F). Two of these samples (Lot 479/FS
469 and Lot 562/FS 576; 10 liters) came from the upper part of the ashy zone (190â200 cm bs);
whereas one sample (Lot 569/FS 629; 5 liters) came from the base of the ashy zone (210â220 cm
bs). Altogether, the 15 liters of sediment yielded 66 ml (12.3 g) of plant remains, most of which
were rootlets and small land snails. Also found were four uncharred (modern) seeds, along with
five fragments of charred nuts, one piece of burned bark, and six chunks of wood charcoal. The
total charred remains weighed about 0.6 g. Analysis of charred wood cell structure and nuts
identified the following. The upper sample yielded pieces of burned Carya (thick hickory/cf.
pecan) nutshell, two pieces of Juglandaceae (hickory type; 0.2 g), and indeterminate wood and
bark species (total 0.1g). The sample from the lower deposits yielded about 0.3 g of wood
charcoal representing Juglandaceae (hickory; 0.1 g), Celtis sp. (hackberry; 0.2 g), and a twig of

an indeterminate wood species (<0.1 g). The tree species are comparable to modern species in
the region. The oak specimen was submitted for radiocarbon dating. Only the charred nutshells
provide tentative evidence of economic activities and perhaps a fall to winter season of use. The
nutshell does not provide convincing evidence that could account for the thick layer of ash buried
at depth.
Two flotation samples were collected from the top and bottom of the general ashy zone
recognized in Block 2, and should provide bracket ages for the stratigraphic zone and its
associated features and cultural remains. One sample from near the top of the ashy zone
consisted of a small piece (<0.1 g) of charred Carya (hickory or pecan) nut hull recovered from
flotation sample Lot 562/FS 576 from Level 20 (190â200 cm bs) in the southwestern quarter of
Test Unit 26. The sample was submitted to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon dating. The resulting
uncorrected radiocarbon date is 1270 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213095) with a 13C/12C value of -25.1 â°
that yields a conventional radiocarbon date of 1270 Â± 40 B.P. The 2-sigma calibration for this
sample is cal A.D. 670â870 or cal B.P. 1280â1080. The dating of a charred nut hull represents an
annual growth, so the age should reflect no cross-sectional effect as commonly found in wood.
The date is the most recent of four dates processed from Block 2 and is stratigraphically and
temporally consistent. The sample probably represents an accurate terminal age for the ashy
deposit in this part of the site.
The second sample from the general ashy fill comes from near the bottom of the fill. The sample
is a small twig of unidentified wood charcoal weighing <0.1 g recovered from flotation sample
Lot 569/FS 629 from Level 22 (210â220 cm bs) in the southwest quarter of Test Unit 26. The
sample was submitted to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon dating. The resulting uncorrected
radiocarbon date is 1480 Â± 40 B.P. (Beta-213097) with a 13C/12C value of -27.1 â° that yields a
conventional radiocarbon date of 1450 Â± 40 B.P. The 2-sigma calibration for this sample is cal
A.D. 540â660 or cal B.P. 1410â1290. The date is believed to provide an age for the beginning of
the general ashy deposit found in Block 2 and to bracket the ages of the dates associated with
Features 12 and 20. However, radiocarbon date Beta-213096 from Feature 20 is younger by
about 120 years than the date from the base of the ashy deposits. Insufficient information is
available to determine which of these two dates is stratigraphically inconsistent.

Material Remains
Block 2 is situated across the relic channel from Blocks 1 and 3 and appears to exhibit a very
different occupation signature. The ashy matrix of the block enhanced the preservation of bone
and other organic remains, but the overall quantities of burned rock, chipped stone tools, and
debris are meager.

Chipped Stone
Block 2 only yielded four (1.8 percent) of the 219 pieces of debitage and only one chipped stone
tool. The four chipped stone flakes include one small tertiary biface thinning flake, one primary
core flake, one small tertiary blade flake, and one secondary flake fragment, all of pale tan
Brazos/Uvalde Gravel material.

119

The single stone implement from Block 2 is an unidentified dart point fragment recovered from
Unit 22 at a depth of 185 cm bs (see Figure 30). This is a medium-sized dart point fragment of
tan gravel chert with some pink tinges indicative of heat treatment. The extreme distal tip shows
a minor impact spall. The blade edges are straight, symmetrical, and biconvex. The shoulders
are weak, rounded, and unbarbed. The stem contracts slightly and has a convex base. One side
of the base is broken, perhaps by the same event that caused the loss of the distal tip. The
specimen is 352+ mm in length, with a 66-mm blade thickness, 166-mm shoulder width, 126-mm
stem width, 108-mm stem length, and a base width of 97+ mm. The morphology does not clearly
compare to any defined dart point type.
Undoubtedly, stone tool manufacturing and resharpening are not activities represented in this
area. In contrast, about two-thirds of all burned clay, bone, and charcoal were recovered from
this block. Freshwater mussel shell from this block constitutes 29.6 percent (n=669) of the
testing assemblage. Burned rock from Block 2 represents 12.9 percent of this class of material by
weight recovered during testing.

Vertebrate Fauna
Faunal remains represented among the 153 specimens collected from Block 2 include Odocoileus
virginianus (white-tailed deer), Testudinata (turtle), Terrepene sp. (box turtle), Pseudemys sp.
(slider or cooter), Sylvilagus floridanus (eastern cottontail rabbit), Lepus californicus (jackrabbit),
Sigmodon hispidus (hispid cotton rat), Pisces (fish), deer-sized mammal, and medium-sized
ungulate. Green fracturing was observed on deer-sized mammal and medium-sized ungulate
specimens. Carbonization or calcination was observed on two unidentified specimens and two
medium-sized ungulate specimens. Weathering was present on deer-sized mammal, mediumsized ungulate, white-tailed deer specimens, Pseudemys sp., and unidentified specimens.

Invertebrate Fauna
Of the site assemblage, freshwater mussel shell is represented by some 669 fragments (29.6
percent). Fifty-eight of the fragments retain hinges or umbos to enable species-level
identification (Table 18). No modifications were observed on the invertebrate fauna from Block
2.

Additional Materials and Samples
Only 1,490 pieces (9.1 percent of the site sample) of burned rock by count and 66.1 kg (9.2
percent of the site sample) by weight were documented for this block. Ninety-eight percent
(64.7 kg) of the burned rock from Block 2 is limestone. Single burned rocks from Features 12
and 20 were processed for the recovery of prehistoric lipid resides. Both results (6GM 3 and
6GM 4) returned lower levels of fatty residues than the four samples from the southern edge of
the site. The residue signature from Feature 12 resembles the lipids from mesquite, cholla cactus,
fish, or corn, although the corn identification is remote in regard of the early age of the
occupation. The signature from Feature 20 resembles that derived from large herbivores, perhaps
bison, deer, or javelina, or sotol.

The density of baked clay (200 pieces, 196.1 g) and daub (32 pieces, 83.6 g) was greater in Block
2 than any other area of the site. Thirty-five grams of charcoal samples were obtained from
Block 2. The abundance of charcoal flecking observed in the ashy matrix during fieldwork
indicated the potential for obtaining macrobotanical remains from this site. Nonetheless, the
processing of some 35 liters of sediment from the ashy zone and associated features in Block 2
only yielded some 3.3 g of macrobotanical remains, which consisted mostly of charred wood.
The interpretive returns after analysis for this effort seem to be low.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY, COMPARISONS, AND CONCLUSIONS

This chapter accomplishes two goals. First, it summarizes the results of the current workâthe
methods, geomorphic studies, and the archeological discoveriesâconducted at site 41TR170.
Second, it presents a review of the regional literature to ascertain how common or uncommon
such burned rock features are in the upper Trinity River and middle Brazos River basins. Efforts
are made to document the horizontal and temporal occurrence of similar sites in the region.

SUMMARY OF THE TESTING RESULTS AT SITE 41TR170
The archeological testing of the alluvial sediments at 41TR170 involved a three-stage approach
that included (1) monitoring mechanical backhoe trenches, with geomorphological studies; (2)
manual excavation of 10 test units that, with the exception of Unit 2 that encountered cemented
gravels 175 cm bs, reached to depths of 200 or 210 cm bs; and (3) manual excavation of 9 m2
more at each of three target occupation zones identified during deep testing. The trenches were
placed north and south of a relic meander of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, which was in use
until historically channelized and straightened about 40 years ago. The backhoe trenching
focused on examining all areas that had previously reported features or artifacts recorded during
the archeological survey by Seibel et al. (2000).
The geomorphic study indicates that the upper 2 m of the site generally contain deposits dating to
the last 2,900 years. The prominent geomorphic feature in most trenches was the presence of the
buried West Fork paleosol, which was capped by more-recent sediments. The underlying basal
sediments consisted of either grayish clay or yellowish clay (see Appendix I). At the extreme
southern end of the site, the trenching and manual excavations encountered cemented gravels that
likely represent a Pleistocene-age gravel bar that rises above the more modern deposits in the
Clear Fork floodplain, just south of the site. The lack of an abrupt boundary in the soil strata
suggests that the deposits have been subjected to some bioturbation by roots, earthworms, and
rodents; but the damage and deposit mixing have not been as severe as found in many other parts
of the Southern Plains.

123

The manual excavations at site 41TR170 documented, with few exceptions, a general low density
of archeological remains but extreme clarity of deposits. This pattern suggests that, by and large,
prehistoric human use of the Clear Fork floodplain during the past 2,900 years involved mostly
short-term, probably specialized extractive or processing activities, but camps near the river were
rare and of brief duration. Reasons for this pattern are uncertain, but such issues as dense
vegetation near the river, irritating insects, and/or uncertainty about flooding events were likely
contributing factors. Indeed, some of the regional settlement trends along the Clear Fork of the
Trinity suggest that camps tend to be located on the low hills or floodplain terraces at the margins
of the valley (cf. Ferring and Byers 2004). Accordingly, a concentration of burned rock features
identified in the southern portion of 41TR170 occurs near the edge of a slightly elevated
Pleistocene gravel terrace. Although the sizes of the rock clasts of the terrace are too small to
have contributed to the numerous thermal features, the elevated setting is apt to have been a
factor in the occupation settlement strategy so that people could escape muddy standing water
during periodic episodes on the floodplain.
Importantly, the archeological remains that were periodically left on the lower alluvial settings
tended to enter the archeological record quickly. The coarser sediment texture of the Clear Fork
alluvium is not prone to excessive shrink-swell fluctuations or the formation of cracks in clays
that allow archeological materials to accelerate the diffusion of occupation zones. The alluvial
sediments offer great potential for finding discrete, unmixed, archeological remains. The overall
assessment is that the site has a high degree of integrity, with low bioturbation of major clasts.
The third phase of excavations focused on three blocks, each measuring about 9 m2 each. Blocks
1 and 3 were along the south edge of the site and contained a multitude of burned rock features
within a 40-cm-thick zone buried about 90 cm bs. In contrast, investigations of Block 2, located
north of the relic river channel, about 275 m away, found a thick, ashy zone containing small
burned rock features at a depth of about 200 cm bs. Eight radiocarbon dates derived from cultural
feature contexts yielded seven reliable dates based on wood charcoal and one anomalously early
date based on humin acid, probably derived from translocation of substances coming from
reworked older sediments in the river.
Despite the large horizontal and vertical separation of the three excavation blocks, the features in
all three are essentially contemporaneous. The one acceptable date from Block 1 provides a 2standard-deviation calibrated span of A.D. 630 to 700. Two dates from the features in adjacent
Block 3 provide a 2-standard-deviation calibrated span of A.D. 540 to 780 (with a 10-year overlap
between the two dates ca. A.D. 650 to 660). Four dates from the thick ashy lens in Block 2 range
from A.D. 540 to 870, although the date from Feature 20 in the middle of the ashy zone yielded a
slightly older date of A.D. 410 to 580. Based on the range of dates and minor elevation and
perhaps stratigraphic differences, it seems that at least two portions of the valley at 41TR170
were intermittently used for a range of purposes by Transitional Archaic people between ca. A.D.
540 and 870. The intensity of these occupations far outweighs evidence for any other period in
this part of the Clear Fork valley.
Despite the significant integrity of features, the abundance of artifacts must be judged as low.
Indeed, the recovery of fewer than 230 pieces of flake debris, four dart points, one small biface
fragment, and nine edge-modified flakes from the about 30 m3 of manually dug and screened
deposits is a very sparse artifact assemblage relative to Central Texas standards. Nonetheless,
most sites in the Trinity River basin have yielded sparse assemblages (Yates and Ferring 1986).

124

Although small, the chipped stone assemblage does reveal some interesting patterns. As at other
sites along the Clear Fork, all of the chipped stone is composed of chert; no quartzite was present.
Of this, at least 81 percent (n=188) is composed of chert that is obviously gravel-derived and 74.2
percent (n=173) of that is composed of one specific type of gravel chert source. This material
appears to represent Brazos/Uvalde Gravel from the Brazos River (Johnny Byers, Archeologist,
University of North Texas, personal communication May 18, 2007). As no chert raw material
sources are available locally, occupants of 41TR170 appear to have brought in initially prepared
raw materials as biface preforms and blanks, often retaining small areas of cortical surface. This
is supported by the lack of cores recovered from this site. In addition, the edge-modified flakes
from this site all are thin and exhibit retouch flake scars or use wear along straight to convex
edges. The working edges of these flakes are not steep, as would be expected for scraping and
other heavy-use activities. Instead, these thin flakes were likely used as cutting and slicing tools.
These kinds of implements are usually regarded as expedient tools, but in light of the scarcity of
locally available lithic resources, these implements may have been saved and curated from one
site and task to the next.
The feature diversity, as well as the presence and absence of select feature types, is the most
outstanding attribute of 41TR170. Unlike many sites in the Trinity River basin, discrete
freshwater mussel shell piles are scarce at 41TR170 (cf. Anthony and Brown 1994; Lintz et al.
2004; Yates and Ferring 1986). Also the size, density, and diversity of the rock features found at
the south edge of 41TR170 are rarely observed among the Trinity River basin sites, and this issue
will be dealt with in greater detail below. Whereas most burned rock features in the Trinity River
tend to be small clusters of burned rock weighing only a few kilograms, the quantity of rock
found in Blocks 1 and 3 is large and diverse. These two blocks represent a minimum of 20
percent of the horizontal extent of burned rock features in the south part of the site, and they
yielded 12,781 of the 16,283 burned rock clasts weighing about 578.2 kg of the total 712.5 kg
collected from the project. Results from testing, trenching, and probing indicate that a zone of
burned rock features, perhaps 20â30 m wide, is apt to occur along the margin of the elevated
Pleistocene terrace. Based on the differences in the sizes of stone clasts in the burned rock
features relative to the size of gravel in the Pleistocene gravels, nearly all of the feature rocks
were hauled from valley margin exposures more than a kilometer away.
The discovery of 10 discrete burned rock features buried about 90â120 cm deep in adjacent
Blocks 1 and 3, which together encompass a total of 19 m2, is remarkable, both in terms of the
density of features, the sizes of features, and the diversity of postulated forms. The large burned
rock features at 41TR170 are quite varied. They include an exceptionally large (2.54 m) incipient
pit oven encircled by a series of low (20-cm tall) mounds of discard burned rock and sediments in
Block 3. In nearby Block 1, two much smaller (roughly 1-m diameter) pits with burned rock lack
the encircling discarded rocks. However, other burned rock features are interpreted as cull piles
of rocks awaiting recycling into other features, or rake-off or dumps from the smaller oven/pits;
an unusual fitted layer of burned rock is interpreted as a large griddle. In other words, the rock
features in the southern part of the site seem to relate to preparations for cooking (cull pile),
cooking activities (pit features, griddle) or postcooking rake-off/discard piles (encircling ring
about Feature 17 in Block 3). These include features that are situated both above the paleosurface
(piles and dumps) as well features excavated below the paleosurface (pits). This range of features
above and below the prehistoric surface accounts for the 30-cm range in elevations where features
are recorded in this area.

125

The diversity of rock features in Blocks 1 and 3 is mirrored in the variety of material remains in
the south edge of the site. The recovery of Yarborough and Trinity type dart points in
combination with the radiocarbon dates from Blocks 1 and 3 supports the use of both areas by a
late Transitional Archaic people over a relatively brief time. These points and the radiocarbon
dates suggest that the occupations were relatively contemporaneous. Whereas Block 1 yielded
158 flakes and six tools, including a ground stone abrader, a series of edge-modified implements,
and the Yarborough point, Block 3 with the large oven feature yielded only 22 flakes, one Trinity
point, and one edge-modified tool. Bone, burned clay daub, and charcoal are relatively rare in
Blocks 1 and 3. Although 771 and 461 fragments of freshwater mussel shell fragments were
recovered as nonclustered scatters from the two blocks, the count of identifiable hinge or umbo
fragments is 63 and 50, respectively. Thus, freshwater mussel procurement and processing seems
to have been a low-level activity relative to the amount of burned rock present along the southern
edge of the site. Attempts to derive information about the resources cooked at these features were
not entirely successful, based on the macrobotanical and lipid residue analyses. Even though the
recovery of useful information was not profitable in the areas examined, probing has shown that
considerable areas of burned rock remain near the Pleistocene terrace.
In contrast, the excavations conducted in Block 2, north of the relic channel, encountered a deeply
buried ashy zone associated with two discrete burned rock pit features and one burned rock rakeoff dump. These also represent Transitional Archaic period features. Although not identical in
form, the recovery of one nondiagnostic large dart point and radiocarbon dates suggests that the
features and ash zone (190â230 cm bs) are generally contemporaneous with the large rock
features and activities farther south.
One of the most outstanding attributes of Block 2 is the ashy matrix, which includes a fair degree
of bone preservation, abundant charcoal, and quantities of daub or burned clay, some of which
have impressions of sticks and twigs. A total of 153 pieces of animal bone was recovered from
Block 2, a substantial amount compared to the four pieces recovered from Blocks 1 and 3
combined. Nevertheless, lithic remains are all but absent from this area; only one point and four
flakes were found in the 3.6-m3 excavation on this occupation zone. Despite careful attention to
the abrupt basal contact of the ashy zone, no postholes, hearth features, or other architectural
attributes were observed. The presence of burned rock features within the ash zone and the bone
indicate that the ash may have been derived from cultural activities. The nature of those activities
that created the ashy matrix is presently unknown. The attribution of the ashy zone to a simple
midden function belies the abundance of charcoal and fired daub with stick impressions. If these
lines of evidence reflect a burned structure, then the lack of architectural features found at the
basal contact would suggest that the house must be very large and very different from those found
at Lake Granbury (Skinner 1971). In light of the age of the ashy deposits dating to the middle of
the first millennium A.D., the prospects of the ash representing a structure is remote.
Nevertheless, ashy âmiddensâ have been occasionally found at 41TR174 and other sites in the
Trinity River basin (Burson et al. 2000). Unfortunately, no excavations have examined a
sufficiently large area to precisely determine what caused these middens or how they were
formed. Clarification on the nature of these features is not discernable without further fieldwork.
Excavations on both the north and the south sides of the relic channel of the Clear Fork River
revealed the presence of terminal Archaic occupations. However, there are substantial
differences in the material expression of the occupations on each side of the river. Excavations
north of the relic channel in Block 2 revealed an ashy site matrix not observed south of the
channel and recovered a greater density of animal bone (n=153) compared to that recovered in
126

Blocks 1 and 3 (n=4). Only five chipped stone artifacts were recovered from Block 2 compared
to the 190 chipped stone artifacts from Blocks 1 and 3. Only 1,490 pieces of burned rock
comprising three features, one small pile of burned rock, and two small hearths (<50 cm in
diameter) were recorded in Block 2. These findings are in contrast to 10 features in Blocks 1 and
3 including a substantial incipient burned rock oven, two large pit hearths/ovens, one possible
griddle feature, one unknown burned rock feature, and five rake-off/dump piles. This is a strong
indication that, while roughly contemporaneous, activities occurring on each side of the river
were distinct enough to produce very different signatures on the archeological record. Although
these two laterally separate portions of site 41TR170 were both occupied between ca. A.D. 540
and 870 and cannot be distinguished from one another temporally, their substantial dissimilarity
suggests that they may be treated as separate components of this site. Table 19 summarizes the
data obtained during testing from each cultural component identified at site 41TR170; two
laterally defined components are listedâone north of the relict channel and one south of the relict
channel.
The contrast in feature morphology between Block 2 and Blocks 1 and 3 indicate that very
different subsistence resources were likely being processed in these activity areas. It is suspected
that, as in Central Texas and indeed the Brazos River valley, the more intensively used ovens and
dump piles in the southern portion of the site accumulated as a result of baking and steaming
plant resources that require longer roasting times. The minimal amount of bone recovered from
this southern portion of the site seems to support this emphasis on plant resources, though
differential preservation may also be a factor. In addition, analysis of the chipped stone debitage
and flake tools from the southern portion of the site indicates that these materials served as
cutting and slicing implements. None of the tools recovered exhibited the kind of steep working
edge that is typically required for hide processing or other heavy-use activities associated with
game processing.
In both the north and the south portions of this site, separate occupations are suggested by slight
differences in depth of features and by overlapping and laterally shifted features. Attempts to
differentiate distinct occupation surfaces were complicated by the presence of features of two
types: those that were situated on and above the terminal Archaic surface (i.e., piles of rock and
dumps), and those that were prehistorically excavated below the terminal Archaic surface (i.e.,
earth oven basins and pit hearths). Therefore, stratigraphically distinct components could not be
identified within Blocks 1, 2, or 3.

THERMAL FEATURES IN THE TRINITY AND BRAZOS RIVER DRAINAGES

Distribution of Burned-Rock-Feature Sites in Northcentral Texas
Initial perceptions among several practicing professional archeologists in the Dallas/Fort Worth
area who observed the burned rock features at 41TR170 indicated that the number and sizes of
such features were relatively unique for the Trinity River basin. Many of the burned rock
features reported for sites along the Trinity River consist of small (50â72-cm diameter) clusters of
burned/fire-cracked rock, comparable to Features 12 and 20 found in Block 2 at 41TR170.
However, the large burned rock areas in Blocks 1 and 3 at 41TR170 are unusual in their
individual sizes, density, structure, and clarity in feature discreteness. The common rock features
in Block 1 seem to be concentrations of burned rocks, several clasts thick, in large, shallow (15â

30-cm thick) basins measuring up to 1.5 m in diameter with lighter scatters of rock covering
larger areas (Features 9 and 13). However, another feature seems to be stockpiles of rocks for
thermal use, based on differences in the sizes of individual rock elements, their degree of
concentration in an amorphous 40-x-80-cm area, and the heaped appearance on the living surface
(Feature 6). Still another feature (Feature 10) appeared as a pavement of heated rocks that, due to
the uniformity of the upper surface, seemed to be a multirock griddle apparatus measuring about
1.3 m in diameter. In nearby Block 3 was found a large (2.1â2.5-m diameter), 21-cm-deep basin
pit with scattered burned rock (Feature 17) surrounded by discontinuous linear heaps of
concentrated burned rock (Features 14, 15, and 16). All four features were interpreted as a large
earth oven with discarded piles of hot stones that were removed to extract unknown baked
foodstuff. Radiocarbon dates suggest that the rock features in all three areas were relatively
128

contemporaneous (Transitional Archaic ages) with a minor degree of stratification, indicative of
intermittent, multi-occupational usage spanning a few hundred years. The dates on the pit oven
feature and the surrounding dump heaps clearly document feature reuse.
The subjective impressions for the uniqueness of these kinds of features in the Trinity River basin
needed to be supported by an examination of the regional archeological record to determine how
common they are. The following discussion presents first the literature survey of Trinity River
basin archeology to see how frequently thermal features have been reported and, if possible, the
kinds of inferred uses for such thermal features. Next are the summaries of burned rock mounds,
ovens, and rock middens in Central Texas, and a review of the distributional extent northward
toward the Trinity River basin. Some of the literature on rock ovens found north of the Red River
is also reviewed to show that, although rare, ovens do occur in Oklahoma and southwestern
Kansas. Most of these studies are fraught with problems due to the lack of adequate excavations
necessary to understand these kinds of features, the lack of rigorous observations that result in
unreliable descriptions/interpretations, and the nomenclature limitations that mask the true
variation of the these classes of features. Finally, a new summary of burned rock features is
presented, compiled from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database for the 15-county region
within 50 miles (80 km) of site 41TR170. Special emphasis is placed on the differential densities
of sites containing burned rock scatters, hearth features, and oven features that occur within the
upper Trinity River and middle Brazos River basins. These data form the basis for supporting or
refuting claims for the uniqueness of the rock features at 41TR170. The issues over the
information available from such kinds of sites are distinct from these surveys.

A Review of Trinity River Archeology Overview Studies
A few regional archeological syntheses have been prepared for the Trinity River basin, but most
provide precious little information about the type, kind, or class of burned rocks observed on sites
in the region (Biesaart et al. 1985; Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990; Skinner et al. 1978; Yates and
Ferring 1986). Avocational archeologists or hobbyists reported many of the earliest archeological
discoveries in the region; however, the quality of their records is sometimes poor. Brief site
reports in the Dallas Archeological Society journal, The Record, indicate that, based on the
diversity of projectile point styles in private artifact collections, many sites were reoccupied over
thousands of years (see Lynott 1977 and Prikryl 1990). Thermal features from such sites are
difficult to interpret, unless they have been directly dated, since the stratigraphic and cultural
context is often lacking. The problem is further compounded by the common use of generalized
functional terminology such as âhearthâ for describing the size, extent, and composition of
features. In the Trinity River basin, many âhearthsâ consist of burned clay layers, but some have
small clusters of thermally altered rock. Some may be haphazard burned rock dumps, while
others are well-formed basins inside prehistoric structures.
Burned rock features are apparently so rare that one relatively early synthesis of the Trinity River
basin does not even list burned rock as a class of artifact, feature, or type of site (Skinner et al.
1978). A contemporaneous study mentions the occurrence of âhearths,â but fails to differentiate
among the various kinds of heating elements (Lynott 1977:Appendices DâG). Although Lynott
(1977:Appendices DâG) does use such terms as cooking âashpitsâ (sic), baking pits, or cooking
pits in his data compilation, he fails to clarify whether or not these pits contain thermal rock
elements. Lynott (1977:Appendices D, E) does mention that 10 of 25 sites (40 percent) in the
East Fork and Elm Fork regions have âhearthsâ (types unknown), but only four (16 percent) are
129

reported to have more than three hearth features; a maximum number of 21 hearths is reported for
one site along the Elm Fork of the Trinity. In contrast, his summary of 29 excavated sites in the
central Brazos River basin noted that 19 (66 percent) contain reported hearths (types unknown),
and 10 (34 percent) of these sites have more than three hearths, with the maximum number of
hearths reported to be 135 features (Lynott 1977:Appendix G). Thus, Lynottâs early compilation
of data supports the notion that hearths are more common in the Brazos River basin than in the
Trinity River basin.
In the early 1980s, the Office of the State Archeologist at the Texas Historical Commission
compiled summary statistics of regions and counties throughout Texas (Biessart et al. 1985). The
database compiled general feature types, but the information was presented in a format that does
not permit sorting by multiple attributes such as cultural affiliations or specific site numbers. The
data collection cut-off was established as May 1981. Four classes of burned features were
recorded: (1) hearths in subsistence setting, (2) hearths in social/ceremonial settings (inside
house structures?), (3) burned rock middens, and (4) burned rock features of unspecified type.
The specific kinds of hearths are not specified, so any hearth association with heated rocks is not
known.
The data on these four classes of features from the 15-county region encompassing the 50-mile
(80 km) area around 41TR170 are presented by drainage basin in Table 20. Thermal features are
present at 182 of the 940 sites. As of 1981, most reported sites (n=548; 58.3 percent) occurred in
the Brazos River basin as opposed the number of sites (n=392; 41.7 percent) in the Trinity River
basin. The combined number of sites with subsistence and social/ceremonial hearths occurs in
percentages comparable to total site occurrences for the two drainage basin regions (n=38; 55.9
percent, Brazos River; n=30; 44.1 percent Trinity River basin). Nevertheless, burned rock
middens occur 8.5 times more often in the Brazos River basin (n=34; 89.5 percent) than they do
in the Trinity River basin (n=4; 10.5 percent). Even though the information is 25 years out of
date, a strong pattern is evident in the scarcity of burned rock middens in the Trinity River basin
region.
Another synthesis used a geoarcheological approach for modeling the distribution of sites on the
Trinity River terraces (Yates and Ferring 1986). A survey of 148 archeological reports prepared
between 1923 and 1985 found that, overall, slightly more than half (51.4 percent) were prepared
by avocational archeologists, slightly more than a quarter (26.4 percent) were developed by
archeologists under federal contract, and more than one-fifth (22.3 percent) were reports on
academic work conducted for degree theses or research grants (Yates and Ferring 1986:Table5.1).
Upon closer examination, however, 75.6 percent of the reports written before 1970 were prepared
by avocationalists. After that date, the hobbyists contributed a scant 16.9 percent of the
archeological reports included in the literature survey. These figures support the perception that
avocationalists have made important early contributions to the archeological literature of the
region.
The summary by Yates and Ferring (1986:Table 5.3) of 81 sites recorded prior to 1985 on eight
7.5 topographic quadrangles (approximately 506.64 square miles; 1,323.41 square kilometers)
discerns that only 15 sites (18.5 percent) reportedly contained hearths, although the frequency and
kinds of hearths were unspecified. The cultural affiliations attributed to these hearth-bearing sites
consisted of Late Archaic (n=1), Late Prehistoric (n=1), multiple component (n=6), and unknown
prehistoric (n=7). Not much was known about the cultural affiliation of burned rock features in
1986, and unfortunately, things have not improved appreciably in the subsequent years.

Prikryl (1990) prepared an archeological synthesis of the Elm Fork drainage of the Trinity River.
His overview of a 300-mi2 (777 km2) area was supplemented by field visits to many of these sites
and documentation of many avocational collections. He compiled information on 238
archeological sites, but most of his data relate to the kinds of tool forms, especially projectile
point types, and the kinds of raw lithic materials used during various cultural periods, with little
discussion regarding features at these sites. Prikrylâs site data appendix lists only nine sites (3.8
percent) with hearths: one site has burned clay hearths, three have rock-lined hearths, but in the
five other instances, hearth types are unspecified. Cultural affiliations for the eight sites with
rock-lined or unspecified hearths consist of Late Archaic (n=1), multiple component (n=4), and
unknown prehistoric (n=3). Prikryl (1990:83) mentions that Archaic component sites occur at
depth and are underrepresented in his summary; however, with his emphasis on artifacts held in
private collections, feature documentation are also underreported.
131

Thus, even though a number of archeological regional summaries have dealt with sites in the
Trinity River basin, the nature of thermal features in Northcentral Texas is still poorly known.
The quality of reported information is of questionable reliability, and the data from most sites are
too poor to ascertain whether most hearths are associated with heated stones. One tentative trend
developed from these studies is that burned rock ovens with large central pits are very rare in the
Trinity River basin relative to those found in the Brazos River valley.

A Review of Texas Burned-Rock-Midden Distribution Overviews
Despite the seemingly rare occurrence of large burned rock features in Northcentral Texas, they
are very common across the Edwards Plateau and especially in counties along the Balcones
Escarpment and the Lower Pecos regions. Over 150 midden sites in greater Central Texas have
been dug by archeologists over the past 90 years (Black et al. 1997:269). The general lack of new
information derived from most of these excavations prompted the Texas State Historic
Preservation Officer to declare in the mid-1980s that his office would no longer support
recommendations for mitigation of such features until explicit new advances in approaches were
developed. This led to considerable debate and data syntheses leading to reformulation of
research designs and field and analytical tactics to be used on burned rock midden features (cf.
Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991). These studies resulted in vast improvements in documenting the
structure of rock clasts and the fine sediment component of features, their ages, and their
association with artifacts and macrobotanical remains.
Regional distributional studies of excavated burned rock features documented for Central Texas
mostly cover a 30-county region extending north and west of the Balcones Escarpment, west to
the Pecos River, and north to the Colorado River in Tom Green, Coleman, and Runnels counties
(Creel 1991, 1997; Howard 1991:55). The farthest occurrences of excavated burned rock
middens toward Fort Worth are in Bosque and Johnson counties, within the Brazos River basin
and within 50 miles of 41TR170. Howardâs tabulation of excavated sites includes 224 features
from 142 sites, which closely agrees with the more recent tabulation by Black et al. (1997).
Considerably more known sites contain unexcavated burned rock middens. One study of an 18county region (extending from Coleman and Brown counties on the north to Medina, Uvalde, and
Kinney counties on the south) indicates 3,341 site records, but reliable records exist for only
some 2,975 sites (Black et al. 1997). Of these, 760 sites contain a minimum of 1,271 burned rock
midden features in a variety of shapes ranging from domed (77 percent), to annular mound (17
percent), and sheet midden (6 percent; Taylor 1997:751). These data compilations suggest that
large ovens and middens may be uncommon in the Trinity River basin.
The scarcity of rock oven features north of the Central Texas region denotes some degree of
decrease in the use of hot stone technological features that form rock middens and oven mounds.
Nonetheless, a number of burned rock mounds and rock ovens have been recorded in southcentral
Oklahoma (cf. sites 34Jn-32, 34At-81, 34At-90, 34Mi-68, 34Mi-253; Lintz and Vehik 1986;
Wyckoff 1984; Wyckoff and Brooks 1983:Table 14). Although no systematic study has been
conducted in Oklahoma and Kansas, many burned rock features may occur along the eastern edge
of the Cross Timbers woodland region and near the tall grass prairies. Insufficient studies have
been conducted on the Oklahoma features to clarify the kinds of resources cooked in these ovens.
Probably, similar resources occur in the Trinity River basin, since the same post oak woodlands
extend south into Northcentral Texas. Reasons for the scarcity of these features in the Trinity
River basin remain unclear.
132

Most archeologists have suggested that the large burned rock features and rock middens represent
predominantly Archaic-age cooking features, since many are associated with various Archaicstyle dart points. However, extensive excavations conducted in large annular rock oven middens
at four sites in the O. H. Ivie Reservoir along the Colorado River found that despite the recovery
of many Archaic projectile points, charcoal recovered from stratified midden deposits yielded
internally-consistent Late Prehistoric dates. The incongruity of early period dart points in a late
period midden was attributed to the use of Archaic-age sediments with incidental artifacts dug
from off-mound for use as an earthen buffer or to protect the foodstuff from excessive heating in
the core element of the oven. Upon retrieval of the cooked food, the fine sediments and older dart
points were tossed out of the central oven pit and subsequently buried by the addition of later
cooking episodes; the radiocarbon dating of these features readily points out the age incongruity
indicated by the dart points and the carbon dates (Treece 1992:Table 52). Clearly, low
confidence in age or cultural affiliation assignation should apply to burned rock features based
only on âassociated artifactsâ (Black et al. 1997:280). A compilation of 141 radiocarbon dates
from 35 Central Texas middens discerned that 81 percent dated to after A.D. 800 and were Late
Prehistoric in age. The earliest date on a midden was nearly 6,700 years old. Black and
colleagues caution that the ages are skewed against the earlier dates due to various charcoal
preservation factors and the tendency for archeologists to choose better preserved and morerecent features. Nevertheless, the results clearly indicate that earth ovens and mounds in Central
Texas have a long history of use and that many date to the Late Prehistoric period.

A Review of Thermal Features in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Database
The foregoing reviews of the regional archeological literature of the Trinity River basin and the
burned rock literature for Central Texas suggest that large burned rock features are uncommon.
However, many of these syntheses are quite old and do not incorporate the most recent site file
data. The following discussion updates the distribution of burned rock features by using the sites
atlas electronic database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission. The data reflect
conditions of the site records as of April 2006.
Insofar as site 41TR170 is located only some 5 miles (8 km) from the drainage divide between
the Trinity and Brazos river basins, any regional survey of site databases should include portions
of the adjacent river valley. In order to assess the uniqueness of sites with burned rock close to
41TR170, a series of steps was implemented in compiling and analyzing data from the electronic
site files. Initially, the target region for consideration involved all counties within an 80-km (50mi) radius of site 41TR170 in total or in part. This target region consisted of some 15 counties.
Table 21 lists for each of the 15 counties the percentage of the county within the 50-mile radius
search area, the nearest and farthest points of the county from site 41TR170, the occurrence and
estimated percent of the county within the Trinity and Brazos river basins, and the total number
of archeological sites recorded in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database.
The number of sites recorded for any county merely reflects the intensity of previous
archeological investigations conducted in response to proposed development. Some counties,
such as Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant, have many recorded sites due to urban development and the
incidence of many archeological studies. A large number of sites in other counties, including
Bosque, Hill, and Palo Pinto, relate to studies conducted at proposed reservoir projects. Other
counties with few reported sites, such as Jack, Erath, and Johnson, merely reflect the scarcity of
archeological projects rather than a genuine absence of archeological remains.

Subsequent to the delineation of the target sample, data on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
was queried using the advanced keyword search function to find those sites with recorded thermal
features. Three general classes of burned rock were postulated. âClass 1 burned rockâ refers to
sites with widely dispersed scatters of burned rock recorded on the site; these may be various
kinds of thermal features destroyed/scattered by either natural erosion or cultural activities such
as plowing. âClass 2 burned rockâ refers to âhearthsâ that might reflect relatively small areas of
clustered burned rock; unfortunately, due to taxonomic vagaries and poor descriptions, some
classes of hearths might not contain burned rocks. âClass 3 burned rockâ refers to large burned
rock features such as ovens or rock mounds. Due to the high potential for multitudes of
archeologists to use nonstandardized terms in recording burned rock, 13 different terms were
searched on the electronic database to capture most thermal features recorded in the target region.
The words used in the initial search in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database for Class 1
burned rock include âfire cracked rockâ/âfire-cracked rock,â âburned rock,â âFCR,â and âburnt
rock.â A total of 329 records (11.1 percent) of probable scatters was identified using these terms.
The initial search for Class 2 types of small, discrete features was conducted on the words
âhearth,â ârock filled hearth,â ârock lined hearth,â and ârock hearth.â A total of 64 sites (2.2
percent) with small hearths was initially identified. The search for Class 3 features was
conducted on ârock oven,â âoven,â âburned rock mound,â âburned rock midden,â and âBRM.â A
total of 28 records (0.9 percent) lists these kinds of large rock features.
The total number of sites containing records for the three classes of burned rock is about 422
records. This is a misleading number, since it includes duplicate listing for each time a site was
revisited during different phases of investigations. Eliminating these multiple listings for specific
kinds of features at the same site drops the number to 367 sites. However, this number is still too
134

high, since the sites are listed each time a different class of burned rock feature is used in the site
form. Thus, for example, if the field records indicate that a discrete hearth is present on a site
with an oven, the site will be counted twice. When these duplicate records are eliminated by
manually checking for redundancy among site numbers, the list of unique sites with reported
burned rock dropped to only 322 of the total 2,963 sites (10.87 percent) in the 15-county target
region.
However, further inspection of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database using the keyword
function still over-inflated the count of sites due to vagaries in the terminologies used by the
recording archeologists completing the site forms. For example, the word âovensâ elicited
positive responses for sites with historic baked enamel stoves/ovens and with historic cookware
pottery marked as being âoven-safe.â Other errors occurred when archeologists stated negative
occurrences on the electronic site forms; for example, a few sites report that âno oven featuresâ
are present. Similarly, searches conducted on the general term âhearthâ yielded positive
responses for sites with just oxidized clay layers observed in backhoe trenches without associated
burned rock or, in some cases, even any artifacts or ecofacts. Such oxidized soils might just be
naturally burned tree events that became buried and may have no cultural genesis whatsoever. In
some cases, archeologists noted that a few scattered rocks (a Class 1 descriptor) indicated the
eroded presence of âhearthsâ (a Class 2 descriptor). Sites identified with the problems listed
above were deleted or manually changed to fit the circumstance in the initial file search. All
electronic site forms for Classes 2 or 3 (features with integrity and substance) were thoroughly
reviewed, but no time was spent reviewing site forms with scattered rock. In lieu of standardized
archeological terminology and nomenclature, such problems will likely persist within the Texas
sites atlas database. These kinds of errors limit the usefulness of the electronic site atlas, and the
resulting site counts should be regarded as approximately correct. Following revisions, the
adjusted count of Class 1 sites with scattered burned rock is 283 (9.5 percent of all recorded
sites), Class 2 sites with discrete hearths is 52 (1.8 percent), and Class 3 sites with ovens/middens
is 26 (0.9 percent). Considering just the subset of sites with thermal features, sites found in both
drainages with Class I isolated or scattered remains is 283 (88.2 percent), Class 2 sites with small
hearth features occur at 52 places (16.2 percent), and Class 3 ovens/mound/middens occur at only
26 sites (8.1 percent) with thermal features within the entire study region.
When the site/feature class data from specific counties are grouped by river drainage basin, an
interesting pattern emerges (Table 22). Only 321 of the 2,963 recorded sites (10.8 percent) in the
entire region report the occurrence of burned rock as scatters or features. Although the greater
number of sites occurs in counties completely or mostly within the Trinity River basin (1,639 of
2,963; 55.3 percent), the greater number of sites with any kind of reported thermal/burned rock
features (211 of 321; 65.7 percent) is in counties wholly or mostly within the Brazos River basin.
Sites with thermal features are nearly twice as common in the Brazos River basin (211; 65.7
percent) than they are in the Trinity River Basin (110; 34.3 percent).
Striking differences are evident when the distribution of the specific kinds of discrete features is
compiled. Figure 37 shows the percentage of a specific feature class to the total number of sites
reported for each county in the study area. The percentage of counties with reported Class 1â
scattered burned or fire-cracked rockâin the Trinity River basin ranges from 0.00 to 14.63
percent, with only two of seven counties containing more than 6.0 percent. In contrast, the
percentages for counties in the Brazos River basin range from 6.41 to 22.45 percent, with all eight
counties containing more than 6.0 percent of sites with burned or fire-cracked rock.

When the same approach is used for Class 2âsmall hearth featuresâsimilar patterns are
apparent. The percentage of counties with discrete features ranges from 0.00 to 4.39 percent in
the Trinity River basin, and four of the counties report no occurrence of discrete hearths; five of
seven counties have less than 3 percent small, discrete features. In contrast, the percentage of
small features in the Brazos River basin ranges from 0.63 to 6.82 percent; small hearths occur in
all counties; and five of eight counties report between 3 percent and 9 percent.
The situation is most pronounced for counties with Class 3âoven features. The percentage of
counties with oven features ranges from 0.00 to 0.49 percent, with only two of seven counties
reporting oven features in the Trinity River basin. However, in the Brazos River basin, the
percentage of ovens ranges from 0.00 to 4.08 percent, with rock ovens occurring in six of eight
counties.
Restated another way, for counties that are wholly or partly in the Trinity River basin, Class 1
scatters occur at 98 of the 110 (89.1 percent) sites with thermal features; whereas Class 2 sites
with discrete features are represented by 18 of 110 (16.4 percent) sites with features. Class 3
oven sites are present on only 2 of 110 (1.8 percent) sites with features in the Trinity River basin.
The previously recorded sites with ovens are 41DN197 and 41TR147.
Turning to the Brazos River basin, the instances of Classes 1 and 2 sites occur in percentages
nearly comparable to those reported above for the Trinity River basin (87.6 percent, 185 of 211
sites with scatters; 16.1 percent, 34 of 211 sites with discrete hearths). The biggest difference is
in the reported sites with earth ovens. The 24 of 211 sites with ovens (11.37 percent) in the
Brazos River basin represent a ten-fold increase over the percentage of sites with ovens in the
Trinity River basin.
Efforts to use the Texas sites atlas to delineate temporal affiliations of hot rock features were
completely thwarted. Very few sites with thermal features were assigned to a single component,
or to any component at all. Indeed, 19 of the 26 Class 3 sites with oven features were attributed
to undefined prehistoric period. Of the seven other sites with oven features, four were attributed
to Archaic affiliations and three were mixed Archaic and Late Prehistoric affiliations. Detailed
chronometric studies for oven sites in Central Texas have documented that archeologists
historically have shown a temporal bias by ascribing oven features to the Archaic period, when
most radiocarbon dates are Late Prehistoric (Black et al. 1997). At this time, insufficient data are
available to judge the age of oven features in the region. Comparable trends are evident in the
Class 2 sites with discrete hearths. Two factors underlie the lack of chronometric data: (1) few
large-scale excavations have been conducted at sites with rock features, and (2) the practice of
submitting site forms to TARL for site numbers usually precedes the availability of chronometric
results or sometimes even a clear understanding of the components represented.

Summary of Burned Rock Feature Distributions
The regional literature review clearly denotes strong differences exist in the distribution of oven
features between the Trinity River and Central Texas. Without doubt, these patterns suggest very
different resource procurement and processing activities in the Trinity River basin from those
commonly found in the middle Brazos River region and across the Edwards Plateau. Since
limestone is abundant across the Trinity River region, the differences are not related to source of
heating elements. Most likely, the patterns are due to some differences found in the economically
138

important tubers, bulbs, or sotol heads or cactus pads in post oak or savannah regions of the
Trinity River basin. Identification of the specific kinds of resources may require the discovery of
accidental cooking events, because the simple charring of cellular plant remains is not necessarily
indicative of cooking. Thus, greater intensity of investigating burned rock features in the Trinity
River basin is needed in order to provide the opportunity of finding such cooking mistakes.
Although the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database reaffirms that the thermal feature
differences are authentic, further studies are needed to deduce the environmental constraints that
restricted the resources in the region. Clearly, the prehistoric activities in regard to hot rock
features in the Trinity River basin are not at all similar to those found in Central Texas.

CHAPTER 7
RECOMMENDATIONS

This chapter presents an assessment of the eligibility of site 41TR170 for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places and for designation as a Texas State Archeological
Landmark (SAL). The following provides discussions about the criteria for eligibility in these
two programs and the potential of the site to yield data that would address the range of research
topics.

SIGNIFICANCE OF SITE 41TR170
The purpose for conducting archeological testing at site 41TR170 was to assess the significance
of the site regarding its integrity and information potential to determine if the proposed
construction of SH 121 would adversely affect a significant site. Site significance is defined on
the federal level by the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through
2000 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470 et seq.; P.L. 89â665; 80 Stat. 915] and through Section 106 of that act. A
testing phase is integral to evaluating whether properties are eligible for inclusion in the National
Register. The qualification for a property to be considered eligible for listing in the NRHP is
based on four criteria of evaluation defined by 36 CFR Part 60. These four criteria are applied
following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions.
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeological, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
Â§ 60.4].
141

Criterion D is most often applicable to prehistoric, and to many historic, sites. Important
information is generally recognized to refer to scientific importance (Butler 1987). However,
scientific importance is partially driven by the research perspectives of the time and in part by the
state of available information regarding a particular research topic in a specific research area.
The purpose for conducting archeology should not be to fill museum drawers with relics, but
rather to fill information gaps in knowledge about specific research domains. As research
progresses within a region, well-excavated sites contribute information to some research domains.
Through time, data needs for some research questions may be addressed to various degrees, even
though complementary data are often needed from different periods, seasons, settings, and site
types to fully understand the diversity of activities. As data required to address specific questions
approach redundancy, such information may diminish the priority of that kind of repetitive
information needed from nearby sites. This suggests that the identification criteria of important
historic properties (i.e., sites considered eligible for or listed on the National Register) are tied to
both a specific geographical area reflecting a cultural adaptation or region and a state of
accumulated knowledge about a research domain. Archeological sites with integrity that contain
artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing research issues are
regarded as significant and are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Archeological sites that exist on static landforms, such as bedrock surfaces or ancient upland
hilltops that lack aeolian sands, can contain concentrated densities of artifacts and feature
remains. Such palimpsest remains of occupations are generally regarded as worthless for
unraveling or contributing useful information toward the understanding of prehistory because the
artifact assemblages are mixed and uninterpretable. In such cases, the sites are not regarded as
scientifically important, and in general, these kinds of sites are not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP.
The most ideal kinds of archeological remains are those left in rapidly aggrading settings, where
there is a chance for noncultural sediments to separate a series of materials and residues
representing brief, short-term activities. Usually, alluvial terraces (during general building
periods), wind-blown or aeolian sand sheets and dunes, and sometimes colluvial slope wash are
the kinds of settings and events that are apt to quickly bury archeological remains and preserve
the discreteness of activities. The evaluation of the depositional potential is one of the key
characteristics for distinguishing the integrity of deposits. As discussed in preceding chapters,
site 41TR170 retains integrity and may have stratigraphically isolatable deposits.
However, while the existence of prehistoric remains in clear or unmixed archeological context is
one key variable for distinguishing important sites, other variables include issues of preservation
and the robustness of the archeological record. In some cases, the activities are simply too
ephemeral to have left evidence, or the evidence is too sparse for interpretation and contribution
to the regional information base. In such cases, despite exceptional depositional segregation of
occupations, the sites cannot be regarded as scientifically important, for the information is simply
uninterpretable. In general, these kinds of sites are also not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
In regard to this latter concept, the artifact assemblage from 41TR170 is regarded as paltry or
sparse relative to the quantities of artifacts common on sites in the Brazos or Colorado river
basins, but the abundance is comparable to many Late and Transitional Archaic sites in the
Trinity River basin (cf. Yates and Ferring 1986). If there is to be any progress in understanding
the prehistory of vast regions of Northcentral Texas, archeologists must shift their thinking to the
comparability of assemblages present in chert-poor and feature-poor regions such as Northcentral
Texas and not focus on artifact materials from chert-rich regions such as found in Central Texas.
142

At the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
(1) The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
(2) The archeological site is situated on private lands that have been specifically designated as an
SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the siteâs original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

Since site 41TR170 is on property to be purchased by the city of Fort Worth and/or TxDOT, it
technically meets SAL Condition 1, regarding political subentities of Texas. At issue, however,
is whether a site meeting that criterion is significant and eligible for designation as an SAL or for
inclusion in the NRHP. In considering the five criteria specifically listed for SAL Condition 2, it
seems that the testing phase at site 41TR170 has demonstrated that within the investigated area
most criteria do not apply. The application of standard archeological techniques (SAL Condition
2A) did not yield significant quantities, abundance, or robustness of information from the tested
area of site 41TR170. The potential of the investigated portion of the site to contribute significant
or new information to the cumulative culture history (SAL Condition 2C) is not encouraging,
based on the information returns obtained so far. The relatively small size of the artifact
assemblage is common for sites in such chert-poor regions as Northcentral Texas. However, the
quantity of burned rock features and documentation that the heated stones were used in nearly a
half dozen feature types is something quite rare in the Trinity River basin. The regional overview
above suggests that such features tend to be more common in the Brazos River basin, a mere 5
miles to the west. The information potential about the nature, diversity, and function of the
features in the areas of Blocks 1, 2, and 3 may not have been exhausted, especially in regard to
the overall diversity and spatial relationships. However, various studies have shown that the
meager returns are frustratingly difficult to use.

POTENTIAL FOR SITE 41TR170 TO ADDRESS REGIONAL RESEARCH DOMAINS
Several research domains were formulated in the research design chapter above. Detailed studies
of the recovered assemblages of artifacts and processing of select samples for macrobotanical
analysis, lipid identification, and radiocarbon dating all provide insights into the kind of
preservation present at site 41TR170. The results are summarized in Table 23.

The radiocarbon dating studies have provided adequate results so that the processing of further
samples would contribute little new meaning or information. In other instances, such as lipid and
macrobotanical recovery, the test samples returned positive results, but either the diversity of
recovered remains was limited and failed to turn up economically useful macrobotanical remains
or the lipids only provided insights into general food classes that provide little interpretative
refinement. Other avenues of investigations, such as exploring hot rock technology through
thermal breakage patterns and clasts size, are certainly possible, but it is unlikely that the
necessary time and efforts expended would provide deeper insights into the nature of the features.
For most research issues, unsettling questions remain about whether further excavations of
41TR170 materials would add to knowledge regarding Transitional Archaic lifestyles in
Northcentral Texas. Based on the results from a rather robust testing phase, the meager material
returns from the site seem to signal that further work would not be very productive.
144

There is no doubt that further excavations along the south edge of the site would provide
potentially important data about the distribution of other rock features adjacent to the Pleistocene
gravel bar. As yet, no satisfactory explanation exists for the cause of the thick ashy deposits
encountered in Block 2. In light of the overlapping and potentially stratified features, it seems
that the ash is likely a cultural midden. Perhaps sediment chemistry and/or magnetic
susceptibility could provide new kinds of information that could shed light on the accumulation
of this midden-like deposit. With the exception of community patterning issues, it seems that
recovered remains may return redundant kinds of information at an expenditure of considerable
effort.
The testing phase at 41TR170âespecially work along the south edge of the siteâhas
documented considerable variability in feature forms during the Transitional Archaic period for
the Trinity River basin. Test probes also strongly suggest that many more burned rock features
occur parallel to the Pleistocene gravel terrace. In this regard, the testing has not exhausted the
information potential related to the community structure or the spatial patterning of activities by
these people. However, the associated stone, shell, and bone artifact assemblages are meager.
Flotation of more then 70 liters of sediments from feature contexts has failed to find economically
useful macrobotanical remains other than a single nutshell and small amounts of wood charcoal.
Efforts to retrieve lipids samples from the burned rock features proved to be successful, but the
results indicate general classes of plants and animals; analysis was not very helpful in isolating
the resources processed in these hot rock features. Although examination of more burned rock
features may stumble onto examples of cooking accidents that preserve ancient foodstuff, the
current robust level of testing suggests that the information content from the site is relatively
limited.
The literature review of the surrounding 15-county region indicates that 41TR170 is unusual for
sites in the Trinity River basin due to the abundance of large burned rock features. However, it is
located only some 5 miles from the Trinity-Brazos river drainage divide, where such features in
the Brazos River basin are far more common. The scarcity of comparable kinds of sites in the
Trinity River basin might be due to the particular setting of 41TR170. The potential that this site
represents an aberrational northeastern expression of an otherwise Brazos River tradition is
suggested not only by the prevalence and density of burned rock features but also by the lithic
assemblage. The chipped stone assemblage from this site appears to reflect curatorial behavior
and exhibits an extremely high proportion of Brazos/Uvalde Gravel cherts. High quality gravel
and cobble cherts were likely obtained from the Brazos Riverâthe shortest distance to the river
from 41TR170 is 40 km (24.8 mi) to the west.
Most survey and testing phases in this portion of the Trinity River valley examine areas near
modern and relic channels, and little attention has been paid to valley margins near Pleistocene
terraces. Such distal terrace settings have not been rigorously examined to adequately
characterize the prehistoric encampments that are primarily located in these settings. Previous
research suggests that archeological sites found within the valleys of the West and Clear Forks of
the Trinity River fall within three general patterns (Ellis 1998). The first includes sites that are
located on the uplands and exhibit a wide range of artifact classes and diagnostics artifacts; often
these sites are the result of multiple occupations creating a palimpsest due to the lack of rapid
sedimentation. Second, are sites that occur on the floodplains or low terraces away from the
river; these sites exhibit narrower occupations spans and a broad array of artifacts. These sites
are the result alluvial stratification of the same occupation and activity patterns that contributed to
the formation of the upland sites. Finally, sites located near the channel of the river are those
with a narrow range of artifacts found in low density.
145

Site 41TR170 most appropriately falls within the second archeological site pattern observed
within the Trinity River valley. This is particularly true for the southern site component located
near the edge of the river valley where flooding would have been less frequent. Although the
range of artifacts and artifact classes may not be broad compared to Central Texas standards, it is
within the expected range for the upper Trinity River valley. More telling perhaps than the range
of artifacts is the diversity and density of the features recorded at this site. The archeological
features at 41TR170 tell a story of repeated occupation and use of this site between A.D. 540 and
870. In both the northern and southern portions of the site, the pattern of site-use and activities
appears to have remained relatively consistent during each episode of occupation, creating a
dense record of subsistence activity separated by minimal alluvial sedimentation.
The low artifact density at 41TR170 is commonly considered to be a function of the lack of
accessible quality chert resources in the Trinity River basin. Still, based on the intensity of
testing conducted at 41TR170, the artifact returns seem somewhat sparse even for a site in
alluvial settings in the Trinity River basin. If this site represents intermittent use by people
accustomed to traditions and cooking technologies more commonly associated with the Brazos
River valley, the low density may instead be a function of the distance of the occupants from their
residential base and their resulting curatorial behavior with regard to chipped stone resources.
Alternatively, the scant nature of the artifact assemblage may have been a function of the minimal
needs associated with the specific activities occurring on site during the Transitional Archaic.
For instance, perhaps the particular plants or other foods that were cooked in the burned rock
ovens and pit hearths at this site required little processing with stone tools, thus resulting in
minimal discard.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Even though site 41TR170 and its features are interesting from a regional perspective, the site has
very limited potential of making further contributions to the archeological knowledge of the
region beyond what has been gathered from this intensive testing phase. For the reasons outlined
above, the site does not meet the standards of Criterion D or any other significance standard
required for assessing National Register eligibility. Similarly, for reasons stated above, the site is
not worthy of SAL designation because it fails to meet the criteria listed under Condition 2.
Thus, site 41TR170 is considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion and no further archeological
fieldwork is recommended.

APPENDIX F
FEASIBILITY STUDY OF MACROBOTANICAL
PRESERVATION
AND IDENTIFICATION FROM SITE 41TR170
by
Dr. Phil Dering
Shumla Archeobotanical Services

Fifteen flotation samples totaling 71.5-liters were examined in this study. The flotation effort
averaged 4.8 liters-per-sample. The samples were recovered from seven features and an ashy
occupation zone located in two excavation blocks.

LABORATORY METHODS
Flotation. Flotation is the process by which organic remains, primarily charred plant fragments,
are recovered from archeological sediments using water as the separating agent. The samples
from 41TR170 were processed using a simple continuous flow device and a 0.0375 mm mesh
collection screen. The heavy material, consisting of large clasts, some bone, and occasionally
heartwood charcoal or nut charcoal, falls to the bottom of the bucket, and the lighter material,
including most of the plant material, both carbonized and uncarbonized, floats to the surface and
flows into the collection screen. This floating material is called the light fraction. The material
that sinks to the bottom, termed the heavy fraction, is rinsed into a 1-mm stainless steel screen.
Both fractions are tagged and slowly dried before they are examined in the laboratory. Flotation
recovery was tested in two samples using 50 poppy seeds, and 96 percent of the poppy seeds were
recovered.
Laboratory Procedures. The analysis follows standard archeobotanical laboratory procedures.
The light fraction of each flotation sample is passed through a nested set of screens of 4-mm, 2mm, 1-mm, and 0.450-mm mesh and examined for charred material that is separated for
identification. Carbonized wood from the 4mm and 2mm screens (smaller pieces are seldom
identifiable) is separated in a 25-piece grab sample and identified. Care is taken to select
representative materials from both levels (cf. Diehl 2003:213; Huckell 2002:645; Miksicek
1994:243). If the sample contains more than 25 fragments, instead of providing counts, I scan the
material, separate it into categories, and record the volume and weight of each taxon or type.
Charred material caught on all of the sieve levels, including the bottom pan, is scanned for floral
parts, fruits, seeds, and other potentially edible plant parts such as nut or maize fragments, and
these plant parts are counted and examined for identification.
Disturbance Indicators. Sample content may be affected by various physical and biological
disturbance factors, including insect or small mammal activity, and plant root growth. In an
effort to assess this impact, the amount of roots, insect parts, termite pellets, gastropods, rodent
fecal pellets, and other biological material is estimated. These amounts are reported on a scale of
1-25 (+), 25-50 (++), and over 50 (+++).
Identification. Due to the rapid decomposition of plant material in soils, only carbonized seeds
and wood fragments are considered to be a part of the archeological sample. Identification of
carbonized wood is accomplished by using the snap technique, examining the transverse, radial,
and tangential surfaces at 8 to 45 power with a binocular dissecting microscope, and comparing
the material to reference specimens in the Shumla Archeobotanical Services herbarium. The
anatomy of some woods is so similar that identification to species or even genus is not possible.
For this reason I combine some taxa into wood types. All identifications in the âtypeâ category
represent identifications to the taxon level indicated by the name of the type. For example, small
walnut (Juglans sp.) or hickory/pecan (Carya spp.) wood fragments may be indistinguishable.
These are placed in a more general category, walnut family-type (Juglandaceae).
F-3

Generally speaking, there are three types of nuts that grow in Trinity River valley, hickory nuts
(Carya spp.), pecans (Carya illinoiensis), and walnuts (Juglans nigra). Many of the charred nut
fragments found in archeological samples consist of the hardened pericarp, commonly called the
nut-shell. These small fragments are often difficult to separate into species, and instead are
placed in a type, usually designated thin-nut and thick-nut. Thin nuts resemble pecan pericarps,
and thick nuts resemble either hickory or walnut pericarps. Although the identification is not as
precise as a species-level identification, thin nut fragments are most likely pecan fragments.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The analysis is summarized in Tables F-1 and F-2. The overview in Table F-1 presents flotation
sample volume, seed density, seed taxa abundance, and disturbance indicators. Table F-2
presents the identifications and counts of charred plant material recovered from the flotation
samples.
As noted in Table F-1, modern contaminants, primarily roots, were found in abundant quantities
in all of the flotation samples. Roots were present in all of the samples, and gastropods occurred
in eight of the samples. Uncarbonized seeds were observed in three of the samples. The
abundance of roots and uncarbonized seeds indicates that the deposits were affected by plant
growth and animal burrowing activity.
Charcoal weights were low, varying from a maximum of 1.9-g in FS 471 from the western half of
Feature 12, to six samples that had no charcoal. Charcoal weight totaled approximately 3.8 g for
all samples. The majority of the charred material was wood charcoal. All of the identified
material was recovered from the 2 mm and 1 mm screens, an indication that the assemblage was
greatly reduced in size as well as quantity. Although overall charcoal recovery was low,
carbonized nut fragments were recovered from FS 576.
Wood. Three wood types and the indeterminate category were noted in the samples. Identified
wood types were the walnut/hickory type (Juglandaceae), oak (Quercus sp.), and hackberry
(Celtis sp.). Walnut/hickory-type wood charcoal may be walnut, hickory, or pecan wood. The
walnut/hickory type fragments from the flotation samples were too small to identify to the genus
level. Walnuts, hickories, hackberries and oaks are trees that would have been growing in the
Trinity River valley during the occupation of site 41TR170.
Nuts. Nut fragments were recovered from FS 576 in the ashy occupation zone in Block 2,
between 190-200 cm below the surface and 2-meters from Feature 12, which was located in the
same level. The recovery of pecan fragments from an occupation zone with a significant quantity
of ash and daub suggests that pecan was harvested and processed during the occupation, and
some shells were incidentally introduced into hearths nearby. The fragments were part of a thin
pericarp or nut shell fragment discarded during processing. Repeated use and cleaning of hearths
spread the ashy zone across the occupation surface.
Nuts were probably harvested, consumed, and stores in large quantities along the Trinity River
bottoms. However, unlike hickory, pecan is not recovered in very large quantities from
archeological sites, probably because pecan does not need to be boiled to extract the oils and nut
meat from the shell. The processes that are involved in pecan harvesting and consumption do not
encourage charring, one of the factors that may contribute to the under-representation of pecan in
the archeological record (Hall 2003:108).

Consequently, despite its remarkable potential as a food resource, the use of pecan is not
documented at many sites in Texas. Pecan fragments have been recovered from sites in Central
Texas from the Kyle site in Hill County and from Bird Point Island in north-central Texas (Fritz
1987; Jelks 1962). Additionally, pecan has been noted in a few Woodland and Caddo sites in
northeast Texas (Dering 1992; 1993; 1995).
There are only scattered ethnohistoric references to pecan, primarily because the Spanish writers
did not often distinguish the types of nuts they were observing. Hall (2003:106-108) has
assembled most of these observations, and he reiterates the difficulty in distinguishing nut types
from accounts related in the journals kept by the Spanish observers. Cabeza de Vaca noted the
collection of nuts along rivers of the Texas coastal plain. These can be identified as pecan

because pecan trees dominate the overstory of the rivers on the central and upper Texas coast, and
because Cabeza de Vaca states that they produce only every other year (Covey 1983 [1961]:69).
The Mendoza-Lopez expedition of 1683-4 also encountered pecans at the western edge of their
distribution, probably on the Middle Concho River and to the east near the Tom Green and
Concho County line (Wade 2003:106-7; 113). Along the Middle Concho River, the Spaniards
were accompanied by Jumanos or Piros who presumably shared in the pecan feast, although the
account of pecan utilization is not very clear. In 1709 Fray Isidro Espinosa encountered Native
Americans with pecans in April, noting that they collected them, shelled them, and kept them
throughout the year for consumption (Tous 1930:10-11). Both Hall (2003:107) and Campbell
(1975:18) note that these were Payaya, and the area was most likely the Medina River south of
San Antonio. Most significant is Espinosa's description of processing; they simply shelled the
F-6

pecans and kept the nutmeat in bags, or on strings. This is clearly not a process that involves the
use of fire or the rendering of fat from the nut. Pecan cotyledons (the nut meat) are so large that
they are easily separated from the shell and consumed outright or mixed into other foods. During
a later expedition around 1720, Espinosa noted that the Caddo in northeastern Texas collected a
small, thick-shelled hickory nut and also a thin-shelled nut, clearly a reference to pecan (Hatcher
1927:153).

CONCLUSIONS
The 15 flotation samples examined in this study contained three wood charcoal types and pecan
nut fragments. Charred plant remains from all samples weighed just 3.8 g, a rather low total
weight. Wood types, including walnut family (Juglandaceae), hackberry, and oak, are typical
elements of riparian vegetation in northern Texas. Pecan fragments were recovered from FS 571,
one of the few examples from an archeological site in northern Texas. The fragments were
recovered about 2-meters from the nearest heating feature, from an occupation zone with ash and
daub. This may indicate that pecan was harvested at the site and introduced into the deposits as
background refuse not associated specifically with any feature described during the excavations.
The energy potential for pecan in the prehistoric economy has been demonstrated by Hall (2003)
who also noted that dense pecan along many rivers in Texas may have had a profound effect on
social and subsistence organization in prehistory. Despite this recognized potential, the use of
pecan is not documented very well in the archeological record. Part of the problem may be
under-representation due to the lack of burning associated with pecan processing, but it also may
be due to the lack of research and recovery in the areas where pecan groves are dominant.
Examples from the Kyle Site (Jelks 1962) and Baker Cave (Chadderdon 1983) indicate that
uncarbonized pecans are recovered in substantial quantities from sheltered sites near stands of
pecan. Continued excavation and recovery of botanical materials from open sites should help to
fill the gap in our understanding of prehistoric subsistence resources and organization.

FEASIBILITY STUDY OF LIPID RESIDUES
ON BURNED ROCK FROM SITE 41TR170
by

Canada R2M 0R9

INTRODUCTION
A total of six burned rock samples were submitted for analysis. Subsamples were taken, then
exterior surfaces were ground off to remove any contaminants. Samples were powdered and
absorbed lipids were extracted with organic solvents. Fatty acid components of the lipid extracts
were analyzed using gas chromatography. Residues were identified using criteria developed from
the decomposition patterns of experimental residues. The first section of this report outlines the
development of the identification criteria. Following this, analytical procedures and results are
presented.

FATTY ACIDS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA

Introduction and Previous Research
Fatty acids are the major constituents of fats and oils (lipids) and occur in nature as triglycerides,
consisting of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule by ester-linkages. The shorthand
convention for designating fatty acids, Cx:yÏz, contains three components. The âCxâ refers to a
fatty acid with a carbon chain length of x number of atoms. The âyâ represents the number of
double bonds or points of unsaturation, and the âÏzâ indicates the location of the most distal
double bond on the carbon chain, i.e. closest to the methyl end. Thus, the fatty acid expressed as
C18:1Ï9, refers to a mono-unsaturated isomer with a chain length of 18 carbon atoms with a
single double bond located nine carbons from the methyl end of the chain. Similarly, the
shorthand designation, C16:0, refers to a saturated fatty acid with a chain length of 16 carbons.
Their insolubility in water and relative abundance compared to other classes of lipids, such as
sterols and waxes, make fatty acids suitable for residue analysis. Since employed by Condamin
et al. (1976), gas chromatography has been used extensively to analyze the fatty acid component
of absorbed archaeological residues. The composition of uncooked plants and animals provides
important baseline information, but it is not possible to directly compare modern uncooked plants
and animals with highly degraded archaeological residues. Unsaturated fatty acids, which are
found widely in fish and plants, decompose more readily than saturated fatty acids, sterols or
waxes. In the course of decomposition, simple addition reactions might occur at points of
unsaturation (Solomons 1980) or peroxidation might lead to the formation of a variety of volatile
and nonvolatile products which continue to degrade (Frankel 1991). Peroxidation occurs most
readily in fatty acids with more than one point of unsaturation.
Attempts have been made to identify archaeological residues using criteria that discriminate
uncooked foods (Marchbanks 1989; Skibo 1992; Loy 1994). Marchbanksâ (1989) percent of
saturated fatty acids (%S) criteria has been applied to residues from a variety of materials
including pottery, stone tools and burned rocks (Marchbanks 1989; Marchbanks and Quigg 1990;
Collins et al. 1990). Skibo (1992:89) could not apply the %S technique and instead used two
ratios of fatty acids, C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1/C16:0. He (1992) reported that it was possible to
link the uncooked foods with residues extracted from modern cooking pots actively used to
prepare one type of food; however, the ratios could not identify food mixtures. The utility of
these ratios did not extend to residues extracted from archaeological potsherds because the ratios
of the major fatty acids in the residue changed with decomposition (Skibo 1992:97). Loy (1994)
proposed the use of a Saturation Index (SI), determined by the ratio: SI = 1G-3

[(C18:1+C18:2)/C12:0+C14:0+C16:0+C18:0)]. He (1994) admitted, however, that poorly
understood decompositional changes to the original suite of fatty acids make it difficult to
develop criteria for distinguishing animal and plant fatty acid profiles in archaeological residues.
The major drawback of the distinguishing ratios proposed by Marchbanks (1989), Skibo (1992)
and Loy (1994) is they have never been empirically tested. The proposed ratios are based on
criteria that discriminate food classes on the basis of their original fatty acid composition. The
resistance of these criteria to the effects of decompositional changes has not been demonstrated.
Rather, Skibo (1992) found his fatty acid ratio criteria could not be used to identify highly
decomposed archaeological samples.
In order to identify a fatty acid ratio unaffected by degradation processes, Patrick et al. (1985)
simulated the long-term decomposition of one sample and monitored the resulting changes. An
experimental cooking residue of seal was prepared and degraded in order to identify a stable fatty
acid ratio. Patrick et al. (1985) found that the ratio of two C18:1 isomers, oleic and vaccenic, did
not change with decomposition; this fatty acid ratio was then used to identify an archaeological
vessel residue as seal. While the fatty acid composition of uncooked foods must be known,
Patrick et al. (1985) showed that the effects of cooking and decomposition over long periods of
time on the fatty acids must also be understood.
Development of the Identification Criteria
As the first stage in developing the identification criteria used herein, the fatty acid compositions
of more than 130 uncooked Native food plants and animals from Western Canada were
determined using gas chromatography (Malainey 1997; Malainey et al. 1999a). When the fatty
acid compositions of modern food plants and animals were subject to cluster and principal
component analyses, the resultant groupings generally corresponded to divisions that exist in
nature (Table G-1). Clear differences in the fatty acid composition of large mammal fat, large
herbivore meat, fish, plant roots, greens and berries/seeds/nuts were detected, but the fatty acid
composition of meat from medium-sized mammals resembles berries/seeds/nuts.
Samples in cluster A, the large mammal and fish cluster had elevated levels of C16:0 and C18:1
(see Table G-1). Divisions within this cluster stemmed from the very high level of C18:1 isomers
in fat, high levels of C18:0 in bison and deer meat and high levels of very long chain unsaturated
fatty acids (VLCU) in fish. Differences in the fatty acid composition of plant roots, greens and
berries/seeds/nuts reflect the amounts of C18:2 and C18:3Ï3 present. The berry, seed, nut and
small mammal meat samples appearing in cluster B have very high levels of C18:2, ranging from
35 percent to 64 percent (see Table G-1). Samples in subclusters V, VI and VII have levels of
C18:1 isomers from 29 percent to 51 percent, as well. Plant roots, plant greens and some berries
appear in cluster C. All cluster C samples have moderately high levels of C18:2; except for the
berries in subcluster XII, levels of C16:0 are also elevated. Higher levels of C18:3Ï3 and/or very
long chain saturated fatty acids (VLCS) are also common except in the roots, which form
subcluster XV.
Secondly, the effects of cooking and degradation over time on fatty acid compositions were
examined. Originally, 19 modern residues of plants and animals from the plains, parkland and
forests of Western Canada were prepared by cooking samples of meats, fish and plants, alone or
combined, in replica vessels over an open fire (Malainey 1997; Malainey et al. 1999b). After
four days at room temperature, the vessels were broken and a set of sherds analysed to determine

changes after a short term of decomposition. A second set of sherds remained at room
temperature for 80 days, then placed in an oven at 75Â°C for a period of 30 days in order to
simulate the processes of long-term decomposition. The relative percentages were calculated on
the basis of the ten fatty acids (C12:0, C14:0, C15:0, C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C18:1w9,
C18:1w11, C18:2) that regularly appeared in Precontact Period vessel residues from Western
Canada. Observed changes in fatty acid composition of the experimental cooking residues
enabled the development of a method for identifying the archaeological residues (Table G-2).

It was determined that levels of medium chain fatty acids (C12:0, C14:0 and C15:0), C18:0 and
C18:1 isomers in the sample could be used to distinguish degraded experimental cooking residues
(Malainey 1997; Malainey et al. 1999b). These fatty acids are suitable for the identification
criteria because saturated fatty acids are stable and the mono-unsaturated fatty acid degrades very
slowly, as compared to polyunsaturated fatty acids (deMan 1992). Higher levels of medium
chain fatty acids, combined with low levels of C18:0 and C18:1 isomers, were detected in the
decomposed experimental residues of plants, such as roots, greens and most berries. High levels
of C18:0 indicated the presence of large herbivores. Moderate levels of C18:1 isomers, with low
levels of C18:0, indicated the presence of either fish or foods similar in composition to corn.
High levels of C18:1 isomers with low levels of C18:0, were found in residues of beaver or foods
of similar fatty acid composition. The criteria for identifying six types of residues were
established experimentally; the seventh type, plant with large herbivore, was inferred (see Table
G-2). These criteria were applied to residues extracted from more than 200 pottery cooking
vessels from 18 Western Canadian sites (Malainey 1997; Malainey et al. 1999c; 2001b). The
identifications were found to be consistent with the evidence from faunal and tool assemblages
for each site.
Work has continued to understand the decomposition patterns of various foods and food
combinations (Malainey et al. 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2001a; Quigg et al. 2001). The collection of
modern foods has expanded to include plants from the Southern Plains. The fatty acid
compositions of mesquite beans (Prosopis glandulosa), Texas ebony seeds (Pithecellobium
ebano Berlandier), tasajillo berry (Opuntia leptocaulis), prickly pear fruit and pads (Opuntia
engelmannii), Spanish dagger pods (Yucca treculeana), cooked sotol (Dasylirion wheeler), agave
G-6

(Agave lechuguilla), cholla (Opuntia imbricata), piÃ±on (Pinus edulis) and Texas mountain laurel
(or mescal) seed (Sophora secundiflora) have been determined. Experimental residues of many
of these plants, alone or in combination with deer meat, have been prepared by boiling foods in
clay cylinders or using sandstone for either stone boiling (Quigg et al. 2000) or as a griddle. In
order to accelerate the processes of oxidative degradation that naturally occur at a slow rate with
the passage of time, the rock or clay tile containing the experimental residue was placed in an
oven at 75Â°C. After either 30 or 68 days, residues were extracted and analysed using gas
chromatography. The results of these decomposition studies enabled refinement of the
identification criteria.
Methodology
Descriptions of the samples are presented in Table G-3. Possible contaminants were removed by
grinding off exterior surfaces with a DremelÂ® tool fitted with a silicon carbide bit. Immediately
thereafter, the sample was crushed with a hammer mortar and pestle and the powder transferred to
an Erlenmeyer flask. Lipids were extracted using a variation of the method developed by Folch
et al. (1957). The powdered sample was mixed with a 2:1 mixture, by volume, of chloroform and
methanol (2 X 30 mL) using ultrasonication (2 X 10 min). Solids were removed by filtering the
solvent mixture into a separatory funnel. The lipid/solvent filtrate was washed with 16 mL of
ultrapure water. Once separation into two phases was complete, the lower chloroform-lipid phase
was transferred to a round-bottomed flask and the chloroform removed by rotary evaporation.
Any remaining water was removed by evaporation with benzene (1.5 mL); 1.5 mL of chloroformmethanol (2:1, v/v) was used to transfer the dry total lipid extract to a screw-top glass vial with a
TeflonÂ®-lined cap. The sample was flushed with nitrogen and stored in a -20Â°C freezer.

A 400 Î¼L sample of the total lipid extract solution was placed in a screw-top test tube and dried
in a heating block under nitrogen. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) were prepared by treating
the dry lipid with 5 mL of 0.5 N anhydrous hydrochloric acid in methanol (68oC; 60 min). Fatty
acids that occur in the sample as di- or triglycerides are detached from the glycerol molecule and
converted to methyl esters. After cooling to room temperature, 3.4 mL of ultrapure water was
added. FAMES were recovered with petroleum ether (2.5 mL) and transferred to a vial. The
solvent was removed by heat under a gentle stream of nitrogen; the FAMES were dissolved in 75
ÂµL of iso-octane then transferred to a GC vial with a conical glass insert.
G-7

Solvents and chemicals were checked for purity by running a sample blank. The entire lipid
extraction and methyl esterification process was performed and FAMES were dissolved in 75 Î¼L
of iso-octane. Traces of contamination were subtracted from sample chromatograms. The
relative percentage composition was calculated by dividing the integrated peak area of each fatty
acid by the total area of fatty acids present in the sample.
The step in the extraction procedure where the chloroform, methanol and lipid mixture is washed
with water is standard procedure for the extraction of lipids from modern samples. Following
Evershed et al. (1990), who reported that this step was unnecessary for the analysis of
archaeological residues, previously the solvent-lipid mixture was not washed. This step was
recently adopted to remove impurities so that clearer chromatograms could be obtained in the
region where very long chain fatty acids (C20:0, C20:1, C22:0 and C24:0) occur. It was
anticipated that the detection and accurate assessment of these fatty acids could be instrumental in
separating residues of animal origin from those of plant (Malainey et al. 2000a, 2000b, 2000c,
2001a).
In order to identify the residue, the relative percentage composition was determined first with
respect to all fatty acids present in the sample (including very long chain fatty acids) (see Table 4)
and secondly with respect to the ten fatty acids utilized in the development of the identification
criteria (C12:0, C14:0, C15:0, C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C18:1w9, C18:1w11 and C18:2) (not
shown). The second step is necessary for the application of the identification criteria presented in
Table G-2.
It must be understood that the identifications given do not necessarily mean that those particular
foods were actually prepared because different foods of similar fatty acid composition and lipid
content would produce similar residues. It is possible only to say that the material of origin for
the residue was similar in composition to the food(s) indicated.
Gas Chromatography Analysis Parameters
The Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis was performed on a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph
fitted with a flame ionization detector connected to a personal computer. Samples were separated
using a DB-23 fused silica capillary column (30 m X 0.25 mm I.D.; J&W Scientific; Folsom,
CA). An autosampler injected a 1 Î¼L sample using a split/splitless injection system. Hydrogen
was used as the carrier gas with a column flow of 1.0 mL/min. Column temperature was held at
80oC for 1 minute then increased to 140oC at a rate of 20oC per minute. It was then programmed
from 140 to 230oC at 4oC per minute. The upper temperature was held for 15 minutes.
Chromatogram peaks were integrated using Varian MS WorkstationÂ® software and identified
through comparisons with external qualitative standards (NuCheck Prep; Elysian, MN).
Results of Archaeological Data Analysis
The fatty acid compositions of residues extracted from the burned rocks are presented in Table G4. The term, Area, represents the area under the chromatographic peak of a given fatty acid, as
calculated by the Varian MS Workstation Â® software minus the solvent blank. The term, Rel%,
represents the relative percentage of the fatty acid with respect to the total fatty acids in the
sample. Hydroxide or peroxide degradation products can interfere with the integration of the
C22:0 and C22:1 peaks; these fatty acids were excluded from the analysis.

High fat content

While all samples contained sufficient fatty acids to attempt identification, recoveries from 6GM
3 and 6GM 4 were quite low; somewhat more lipid was recovered from 6GM 6. In comparison,
recoveries from the other three samples, 6GM 1, 6GM 2 and 6GM 5, were significantly higher.
Three burned rock residues have significantly elevated levels of C18:1 isomers, which indicates
the presence of fat or oil in the residue. Levels of C18:1 isomers in 6GM 1, 6GM 2 and 6GM 5
are extremely high, ranging from 69.25 percent to 76.37 percent. These levels are observed in the
decomposed residues of foods of very high fat content seeds or nuts, such as piÃ±on. Rendered
fats of certain mammals (other than large herbivores) exhibit similarly very high levels of fat
content when fresh. Given that these represent partially decomposed archaeological burned rock
residues, a plant origin is more likely.
One residue, 6GM 6, is characterized by high levels of C18:1 isomers. The most probable source
of this residue is locally available high fat content seeds and nuts. Given the elevated levels of
C18:2, medium chain fatty acids and very long chain fatty acids in this residue, it is more likely to
be of plant origin.
One residue, 6GM 3, appears to result from the preparation of medium fat content foods, such as
mesquite, corn and cholla. This residue has elevated levels of C18:1 isomers and relatively lower
levels of C18:0. Fish produces similar residues; but the elevated levels of C18:2 and medium and
very long chain saturated fatty acids are indicative of a plant origin.
One residue, 6GM 4, is consistent with the preparation of large herbivore in combination with
plants or large herbivore bone marrow. These residues are characterized by elevated levels of
C18:0 and C18:1 isomers. The elevated levels of medium and very long chain saturated fatty
acids in this residue support a large herbivore meat and plant combination, rather than large
herbivore bone marrow. In the Great Plains, bison and deer are the most likely source of residues
with elevated levels of C18:0; however, javelina and the seeds of certain cacti are known to
produce similar residues. It is possible that this residue represents a combination of javelina or
cacti seeds, such as sotol, with plant.

INTRODUCTION
The site 41TR170 archaeofauna produced a sizeable amount of faunal material primarily
consisting of fragmented artiodactyl remains and bivalve shell fragments. There is a signature of
Bison bison at the site, and other taxa that are represented include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), leporids (Lepus and Sylvilagus), turtles (terrestrial and aquatic), Canis (probably
dog), fish, the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), and several shellfish taxa (Table H-1). This
report summarizes basic criteria for identification of the specimens followed by a brief statement
on taphomony. The number of identifified specimens (NISP) is reported in Table H-1. Burning,
weathering, and green fracturing are recorded in the appendix, but they are discussed only briefly
in the report. Biological nomenclature throughout this report follows Hall (1981) with updates
from Schmidly (1994) for vertebrates and Howells et al. (1996) for invertebrates.

SYSTEMATIC PALEONTOLOGY
Specimens are assigned to class, order, suborder, family, genus, and species according to their
identifiability. Size classes (e.g., âmedium ungulateâ and âdeer sizeâ) are used to describe
remains that bear no diagnostic features but are similar in size and shape to portions from a
particular element from a species; the class âmedium ungulateâ is less diagnostic than âdeer sizeâ
and tends to comprise long-bone midshaft fragments. Specimens assigned to medium ungulate
are not included in the systematic paleontology. Given the low density of elements from the axial
skeleton and the taxonomic overlap in morphological characteristics of rib fragments in
particular, several fragments are considered âunidentified.â When identifications of such
elements are possible (including long-bone shaft fragments), they are offered in terms of size
class, which is a conservative approach. Two specimens are referred to Pisces and are not given
further attention in the report. Freshwater bivalve remains are identified through comparison to
modern specimens from the region and through use of published criteria discussed in more detail
below.
Vertebrate Fauna
Class Mammalia (mammals)
Order Artiodactyla (even-hooved animals)
Family Cervidae (deer, elk, and moose)
Deer size (compares in size to Odocoileus virginianus)
NISP: 1 left mandibular ascending ramus, 1 left anterior lumbar vertebral zygapophysis,
1 right medial femur shaft fragment, 1 metapodial shaft fragment.
Total NISP = 4
Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer)
NISP: 7 right humerus fragments (refit), 1 right distal humerus fragment, 3 left radius fragments
(refit), 1 right radius (complete), 2 right ulna fragments (refit), 1 right ulna shaft fragment, 1 left
ulna shaft fragment, 1 left cuneiform, 1 left lunar, 1 left scaphoid, 1 left trapezoid magnum, 1 left
unciform, 1 left astragalus, 1 right astragalus, 1 first phalanx, 3 third phalanx fragments (refit).
Total NISP = 27
H-4

Remarks: These specimens were identified in comparison to modern specimens and according to
criteria outlined by Lawrence (1951). Long-bone midshafts are not diagnostic and were assigned
to âmedium ungulateâ as a result (Appendix 1A). Remains of white-tailed deer are common in
archaeological sites that date to the Holocene in Texas (see references in Perttula 2004), and
though mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) have occurred in the state, their historic distribution is
farther west (Schmidly 1994). Further, white-tailed deer tend to be slightly smaller than mule
deer (though there is overlap). The specimens from 41TR170 compare in size quite favorably to
small white-tailed deer. White-tailed deer represents the largest-bodied, consistently available
prey to humans in eastern North America during most of the Holoceneâ¯ranging between 22.5
and 180 kg (Schmidly 1994; Smith 1991). Elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) were
also available in areas of the eastern woodlands, the mid-south, and the Midwest (e.g., Wolverton
2002). However, white-tailed deer were extremely important prey because their range extends
across all of eastern North America and they thrive in many kinds of habitat (Hall 1981;
Hamilton and Whitaker 1979; Smith 1991). Further, it is well documented that deer were heavily
hunted by prehistoric humans and that this taxon was an extremely important source of protein
during much of the Holocene, especially during the late Holocene (e.g., Wolverton 2005).
Several specimens appear to have come from the front limbs of the same individual in that limb
elements are for the most part paired from similar horizontal and vertical contexts. Only the first
phalanx appears to have been fractured when fresh, though one radius exhibits a potential
cutmark at its distal end. Along similar lines there is a nearly complete set of left carpals that
anatomically refit with one another. That one of the radii is complete is almost unheard of in
archaeological contexts in that marrow-bearing limb bones are ubiquitously fragmented to
retrieve within-bone nutrients. There is little to no evidence that these white-tailed deer front
limbs were processed for within-bone nutrients; however, the absence of cutmarks does not
indicate that the limbs were not butchered for meat in that cutmarks are epiphenomena, i.e., they
are accidental marks left not in attempts to butcher bone but in attempts to remove meat (Lyman
1994).
There is a poor record of prehistoric white-tailed deer body size in north Texas compared to other
portions of the state. Two astragali from 41TR170 add to the small database in that the astragalus
is a useful indicator of body size in ungulates (Purdue 1987, 1989; Wolverton et al. 2007).
Southeast Texas deer are extremely small as observed in the large late Holocene sample from the
Eagleâs Ridge site (41CH252). During the Holocene deer from central Texas were relatively
large in comparison to those from southeast Texas. Size of north Texas white-tailed deer during
the late Holocene appears to fall between the southeast and central Texas distributions (Figure H1). As the database grows it will be possible to determine whether or not the four astragali
sampled represent body size or sexual dimorphism, i.e., they might be from does.
Family Bovidae (antelopes, cattle, gazelles, goats, sheep, and relatives)
Bison bison (bison)
NISP: 1 left upper molar, 2 left astragali (refit).
Total NISP = 2
Remarks: The Bison bison specimens exhibit diagnostic features that allow them to be
distinguished from domestic cattle using modern comparative materials and published criteria.
The astragalus was identified using criteria described by Olsen (1960). The main criterion used
in this identification is the position of the medial tubercle in relation to the distal trochlea on the
anterior surface of the astragalus; the tubercle is relatively distal in Bos taurus. Further

distinction is possible using the shape of the posterior articular surface of the astragalus
(Lawrence 1951). The left upper molar is either an M1 or M2, which cannot be easily
distinguished when isolated from the maxilla. From a biogeographic perspective, this site is
important because it offers additional evidence as to the Holocene distribution of Bison bison in
Texas.
Order Lagomorpha (hares, rabbits and pikas)
Family Leporidae (rabbits and hares)
Lepus californicus (jackrabbit)
NISP: 1 left ilium fragment.
Total NISP = 1
Remarks: The ilium fragment is too large to be from cottontail and is thus assigned to Lepus.
Postcranial elements of Lepus are difficult to separate to species; only the black-tailed jackrabbit
(Lepus californicus) occurs in Texas historically (Schmidly 1994). Other members of Lepus tend
to occur to the west and north of Texas (Dunn et al. 1982).
Sylvilagus floridanus (eastern cottontail rabbit)
NISP: 1 right anterior mandible fragment with P4.
Total NISP = 1

H-6

Remarks: This specimen was identified through comparison to modern specimens. Although
diagnostic characteristics of jackrabbits (Lepus sp.) and swamp rabbits (Sylvilagus aquaticus) are
similar to those of the eastern cottontail (S. floridanus) and the marsh rabbit (S. palustris), the
latter two species tend to be much smaller in body size. The range of S. palustris includes the
southeastern United States, but its range during the historic period is east of Louisiana (Hall
1981). In contrast, the range of the eastern cottontail extends through much of eastern North
America. Based on size and modern ranges, the mandible specimen is assigned to S. floridanus.
The eastern cottontail tolerates a diverse array of habitats but generally prefers brushy areas along
timbered edges, which includes river and stream corridors (Jones et al. 1985). Relative to many
other prey taxa (e.g., white tailed deer and turkey [Meleagris gallopavo]) the cottontail would
have offered relatively low returns in that their body size is small. However, trapping and/or
netting technologies substantially decrease the cost of acquiring rabbits, which increases their net
caloric return rate to humans.
Order Rodentia (rodents)
Family Muridae (mice and rats)
Sigmodon hispidus (hispid cotton rat)
NISP: 1 right proximal femur.
Total NISP = 1
Remarks: The hispid cotton rat is common in most areas of Texas including Tarrant County. This
specimen compares closely in size and morphology to Sigmodon hispidus using modern
comparative materials in our collection. This burrowing rodent is likely to be intrusive to the
cultural deposit at 41TR170.
Order Carnivora (carnivores)
Family Canidae (dogs, foxes, and relatives)
Canis sp.
NISP: 1 right proximal humerus
Total NISP = 1
Remarks: This specimen compares favorably to domestic dog (C. familiaris) or wolf (C. lupus).
The designation as Canis sp. reflects that it is difficult to distinguish domestic dog post-cranial
remains from those of wolves and large coyote (C. latrans) (Kranz 1959; Nowak 1979).
Proximal breadth (33.1 mm) and proximal depth (47.1 mm) were taken following Von den
Driesch (1976), but no morphometric comparisons to other canids are made here.
Class Reptilia (reptiles)
Order Testudinata (turtles and tortoises)
NISP: 1 peripheral carapace fragment, 7 carapace fragments, 6 carapace/plastron fragments, 18
plastron fragments.
Total NISP = 32
Remarks: Specimens in Testudinata are clearly turtle but are too fragmentary to assign to a more
specific taxon.
cf. Pseudemys sp. (compares favorably with cooters and sliders)
NISP: 17 carapace fragments, 7 carapace/plastron fragments, 1 costal carapace fragment, 1
peripheral carapace fragment, 1 left proximal humerus.
Total NISP = 27
H-7

Remarks: No member of Pseudemys is common in the Upper Trinity River drainage today,
though P. texanaâs (Texas cooter) modern range is just to the south in central Texas and several
species of the genus occur in east Texas (Garrett and Barker 1987). The fragmentary nature of
the remains makes it difficult to assign them to a particular species with confidence, hence the
designation as cf. Pseudemys sp. The peripheral carapace fragment exhibits a potential cutmark.
Terrepene sp. (box turtle)
NISP: 1 costal carapace fragment, 1 vertebral carapace fragment.
Total NISP =2
Remarks: These specimens are identified to Terrepene sp. through comparison to modern
materials. The costal fragment is too curved to be assigned to any other turtle taxon, and the
vertebral carapace fragment is an exact morphological match with modern members of the genus.
Two species of box turtle in the genus Terrepene occur within Texas today, the ornate box turtle
(Terrepene ornata) and the three-toed box turtle (Terrepene carolina). The ornate box turtle is
the western form, though the species are capable of hybridization where their ranges overlap
(Ernst et al. 1994). The ranges of T. ornata and T. carolina converge in central Texas, though T.
ornata is more common across Texas (Dixon 1987; Garrett and Barker 1987). It is likely that
turtle remains at 41TR170 are from prey hunted by humans (Wolverton 2005).
Invertebrate Fauna
Phylum Mollusca (molluscs)
Class Bivalvia (bivalves)
Order Unionoida (freshwater mussels)
Family Unionidae (pearly mussels)
Genus Amblema
Amblema plicata (threeridge)
NISP: 65 valves.
Remarks: Specimens identified as A. plicata are heavy shelled, and characterized by the presence
of 3 to 7 ridges, which run diagonal to the ventral margin. The pseudocardinal teeth for these
specimens are also diagnostic: the left valve contains two large, divergent, grooved, triangular
pseudocardinal teeth. The right valve has one elevated, grooved, triangular pseudocardinal tooth.
Threeridge is a robust species, tolerant of drought and low water quality, and potentially inhabits
both lakes and streams (Howells et al. 1996). The species examined are elongated and relatively
compressed, which is indicative of species found in lotic systems. Three of the 65 valves
examined have probable cutmarks near the posterior most ridge; these valves contain rectangular
excisions, which appear physically different than wearing of the shell due to hydrological or
taphonomic processes. The excisions are a probable byproduct of human exploitation for food
and tool or jewelry use (Howells et al. 1996; Peacock 2000).
Genus Fusconaia
Fusconaia askewi (Texas pigtoe)
NISP: 3 valves.
Remarks: Texas pigtoes are small rhomboidal to elliptical shaped with moderately thick shells.
The main criteria used in identification are posterior truncation and ventral indentation near the
posterior ridge. F. askewi is often confused with freshwater mussels from the genus Quadrula.
H-8

The three specimens examined were compared to modern samples from the Upper Trinity River
Drainage. Texas Pigtoe is a lotic species found inhabiting various substrates and tolerates
flowing to standing water (Howells et al. 1996). F. askewi is intolerant to changes in
environmental conditions, and thus a reasonable indicator of stream health. The presence of
Texas Pigtoe at 41TR170 is unique, in that it exceeds the known modern range for this species.
Genus Lampsilis
NISP: 11
Lampsilis teres (yellow sandshell)
NISP: 18 valves.
Lampsilis cf. teres (compares favorably with yellow sandshell)
NISP: 1 valve.
Remarks: Specimens identified to the genus Lampsilis, possess pseudocardinal teeth synonymous
with this genus. The right valve contains two pseudocardinal teeth; the anterior tooth is low and
compressed, the posterior tooth is triangular, striated and raised above the hinge line. The left
valve is characterized by two divergent, compressed pseudocardinal teeth, which are elevated
above the hinge line and may be emarginated in some species. Yellow sandshell is elongate in
outline, with thick shells that taper to a point at the posterior margin. The pseudocardinal teeth
are typical of species from this genus. The specimens examined were identified to the species
level, using modern comparative specimens. The main characteristic used in distinguishing this
species from others in the Lampsilis or Ligumia genus is the presence of moderately raised beaks
lacking shell ornamentation. Similar to the Texas pigtoe, yellow sandshell is intolerant of
environmental perturbations, and is found only in lotic habitats.
Lampsilis hydiana (Louisiana fatmucket)
NISP: 7 valves.
Remarks: Specimens identified as Lampsilis hydiana are characterized by being large, swollen
and rhomboidal in shape. The umbo is used as the main diagnostic feature to distinguish L.
hydiana from similar species. The beak cavity for the Louisiana fatmucket is moderately deep;
the umbo is raised well above the hinge line and lacks ornamentation such as v-shaped ridges. L.
hydiana is relatively tolerant of environmental disturbances and can adapt to both lentic and lotic
systems. This species can also tolerate low flow and backwater areas (Howells et al. 1996).
Genus Ligumia
Ligumia subrostrata (pondmussel)
NISP: 15 valves.
Remarks: Ligumia subrostrata is identified by the presence of wide v-shaped ridges radiating out
from the umbo. The use of shell ornamentation for identification is due to similarities in general
shell morphology among species in the genus Lampsilis, Toxolasma and Ligumia. Pondmussel,
unlike the other species recovered at 41TR170, is unique in that it can tolerate a variety of lotic
habitats, but adapts well to small streams, ponds and backwater areas (Howells et al., 1996). The
presence of Ligumia subrostrata is also significant, in that it exceeds the known range for this
species.

H-9

Genus Plectomerus
Plectomerus dombeyanus (bankclimber)
NISP: 19 valves.
Plectomerus cf. dombeyanus (compares favorably with bankclimber)
NISP: 3 valves.
Remarks: Specimens identified as P. dombeyanus have a pronounced posterior ridge, which
extends from the ventral margin and terminates near the umbo. The surface of bankclimber is
also used in differentiating this species from Tritogonia verrucosa. Specifically, shell
ornamentation in the form of pustules and tubercles is restricted to the beak area, while in T.
verrucosa shell ornamentation is found throughout the shell surface. The pseudocardinal teeth for
these specimens are diagnostic as well: the left valve contains two large, divergent, grooved
pseudocardinal teeth separated by a shallow notch. The right valve has one elevated, grooved,
pseudocardinal tooth with an anterior and posterior denticle. Bankclimber is often found near the
banks or shallow areas of large, slow flowing rivers (Howells et al. 1996). The presence of P.
dombeyanus is significant because it is found only in these prehistoric assemblages in the north
Texas region.
Potamilus purpuratus (bleufer)
NISP: 2 valves.
Potamilus cf. purpuratus (compares favorably with bleufer)
NISP: 1 valve.
Remarks: Bleufer is characterized by having a large oblong, compressed shell that is
subrhomboidal to subellipitcal in appearance. None of the specimens from 41TR170 are
completely intact, but the thickness of the shell and lack of ornamentation or ridges is useful in
identification. The main criterion used in identifying P. purpuratus is the morphology of the
pseudocardinal teeth: the left valve contains two large, striated, erect, pseudocardinal teeth
separated by a shallow notch. The posterior tooth is square to subrectangular in shape, while the
anterior tooth is pointed and always forward of the umbo. The right valve has one slightly
compressed pointed pseudocardinal tooth and a thin compressed anterior denticle. Bleufer is
found in both lentic and lotic systems, preferring deep bodies of water with muddy to sandy
bottoms (Howells et al. 1996).
Genus Quadrula
NISP: 12 valves.
Quadrula apiculata (southern mapleleaf)
NISP: 2 valves.
Remarks: Specimens identified to the genus Quadrula are classified based on the pseudocardinal
teeth, which are fairly conserved throughout this genus. The right valve for quadrulids contains
one pseudocardinal tooth, which is rectangular or columnar in shape, heavily striated, and
elevated above the hinge line. In some specimens an anterior denticle may be present. The left
valve for this genus contains two pseudocardinal teeth, which are rectangular to subtriangular in
shape, striated and elevated above the hinge line. The left pseudocardinal teeth tend not to be
widely separated, and the anterior tooth is much larger than the posterior pseudocardinal tooth.
Southern mapleaf is identified primarily based on shell ornamentation and comparison with
contemporary specimens. Both of the valves examined have small pimples anterior to the sulcus.
One valve examined is covered entirely with pimples, suggesting that it may have been a juvenile
H-10

(less than two years of age). Q. apiculata is a ubiquitous species able to inhabit both lakes and
streams and that tends to establish large populations (Howells et al. 1996). It is interesting to note
that only 2 valves were recovered.
Quadrula mortoni (western pimpleback)
NISP: 17 valves.
Remarks: Specimens identified as Western Pimpleback have pseudocardinal teeth typical of
quadrulids. One important difference is the teeth found in the left valve. The pseudocardinal
teeth in the left valve are similar to other members of this genus, except that the anterior tooth is
more massive, and tends to be greater in stature than the posterior tooth. The external
morphology of the Western pimpleback is another criterion used in differentiating this species.
Q. mortoni possesses a heavy, thick shell with little or no ornamentation that may range from
globular to subrhombodial in shape. This species may at times be confused with the pigtoe, but
can be differentiated based on a more inflated, globular appearance and a posterior ridge that is
rounded rather than defined. Western Pimpleback occurs in both lentic and lotic habitats, and
appears to be ecophenotypically plastic. The specimens from 41TR170 are more round-shaped,
which is indicative of a lotic habitat. The presence of Western Pimpleback at 41TR170 is unique,
in that it exceeds the known range for this species. Finally, it is important to note that Quadrula
pustulosa morton is used interchangeably with Quadrula mortoni, but should be referred to as Q.
mortoni based on recent molecular findings (Serb et al. 2003).
Genus Tritogonia
Tritogonia verrucosa (pistolgrip)
NISP: 13 valves.
Tritogonia cf. verrucosa (compares favorably with pistolgrip)
NISP: 3 valves.
Remarks: Pistolgrip is identified using shell morphology and by comparing pseudocardinal teeth
with contemporary specimens. The surface of pistolgrip is covered with pimples, pustules and
small tubercles. The overall shape of the valve is elongated and rhomboid in appearance. The
valves are thick, and squarely or obliquely truncated near the interface between the posterior and
ventral margin. The beaks are slightly elevated above the hinge line and are helpful in
differentiating T. verrucosa from bankclimber. The pseudocardinal teeth for these specimens are
diagnostic as well: the left valve contains two large, divergent, serrated, triangular pseudocardinal
teeth, which may be oblique to one another. The right valve has one elevated, grooved, triangular
pseudocardinal tooth with only an anterior denticle. Pistolgrip is a lotic species found often in
riffles, but may also tolerate slow flowing rivers (Howells et al., 1996). Like other lotic species,
the pistolgrip is intolerant to environmental disturbance.

TAPHONOMY
A high proportion of vertebrate remains from 41TR170 exhibits weathering (Table H-2), which
may account for the low proportion that exhibit green fracturing in that weathering tends to erode
fracture morphology. The presence of weathering suggests that many of these remains were
exposed on a relatively stable surface for an unknown period; many of these remains were not
rapidly buried. On the other hand, NSP:NISP data indicate that remains from the site are not
extremely fragmented compared to other sites from Texas (Table H-3; Figure H-2). NSP:NISP is

Figure H-2. The relationship between fragment weight and NSP:NISP for sites in Texas (see Table H-3). The sample

fragmentation.

H-12

a ratio between the number of vertebrate remains (Number of Specimens [NSP]) in a fauna
compared to the Number of Identifiable Specimens (NISP); as the ratio increases a fragment size
decreases. Low NSP:NISP suggests low intensity of fragmentation in a fauna in that the
proportion of large, identifiable specimens is relatively high. That cutmarks and evidence of
burning are infrequent on the vertebrate remains(see Table H-2) and that multiple white-tailed
deer elements are relatively whole suggest that the ungulate remains are relatively unmodified by
human butchery behaviors. This, however, does not mean that the fauna is not archaeological;
the 41TR170 assemblage is taxonomically characteristic of an archaeological rather than a
paleontological fauna in that represented taxa, with the exception of Sigmodon hispidus, are
commonly thought to have been prey for prehistoric human hunters.
The invertebrate fauna exhibits characteristics related to human use of the remains. Shell remains
from Trench 9 are burned, and 11 fragments exhibit modification related incision of the shells
presumably to remove portions for use in other contexts (e.g., bead-making or tool-making).
Although only a small proportion of the remains exhibit evidence of burning and cutting (< 1 %)
this likely relates to the fact shellfish remains tend to be highly fragmented, in this case
NSP:NISP is 11.74.

SUMMARY
This report offers criteria for element and taxonomic identifications. Many of the specimens are
too fragmented to provide diagnostic criteria for identification. As a result, only brief discussion
of taphonomy is possible (see above). The fauna contains remains of a taxa that are important in
terms of biogeographyâBison bison, Plectomerus dombeyanus, Fusconaia askewi, Ligumia
subrostrata, and Quadrula mortoni. Further, the invertebrate fauna is important in terms of
environmental science in that it reflects prehistoric hydrological conditions in the Upper Trinity
River that are less common today (e.g., ubiquitous, perennial, deep-flowing streams). Whitetailed deer are commonly represented as remains of prehistoric diet throughout much of the
Midwest and Texas. The cotton rat femur was likely to have been naturally deposited. The fauna
is fairly uniform in its taphonomy in that many remains exhibit weathering, which suggests that
parts of the fauna were exposed on the surface for some period.

STRATIGRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF 28 TRENCHES
AT SITE 41TR170, TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS
by
Stephen A. Hall, Ph.D.
Red Rock Geological Enterprises

Stratigraphy of 28 trenches, site 41TR170, Tarrant County, Texas; texture follows Wentworth
scale; dry sediment color from Munsell Soil Color Charts where indicated; numbers are
centimeters depth from modern [2005] surface; radiocarbon dates are summarized in Table 4.
Trench 1 (South), located perpendicular to south-side bend in old Clear Fork channel;
photograph of West Fork paleosol and post-paleosol contact shown in Figure 7
0-53 cm

Post-paleosol alluvium, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), silt, clayey, sandy, massive with
no visible bedding, calcareous but no visible carbonates, occas. land snail shell
(Rabdotus) and shell fragments, no pebbles, soft when damp, hard when dry, earth
worm and burrowing insect traces, A horizon soil absent at upper surface; lower
boundary with paleosol indistinct and gradational due to bioturbation across
boundary

53-182

West Fork paleosol, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), silt, clayey, sandy, massive
without visible bedding or microstratigraphy, absence of slickensides, soft when
damp, hard when dry, calcareous but no visible carbonates, occas. land snail shells
(Rabdotus, Helicina), earth worm traces throughout; lower boundary grades to
underlying silt within a few centimeters; lower boundary of paleosol is not at same
depth and is 23 cm more shallow elsewhere in trench exposure; some carbonate
filaments occur in lower 14 cm of paleosol at measured section (fewer in upper and
more in lower part of this zone); isolated mussel shell at 95 cm depth; isolated in situ
stones at 92 and 112 cm depth and 2 stones, one on top of the other, at 133 cm
depth; conventional radiocarbon age on bulk sediment from 66â72 cm depth is 1240
Â± 40 14C yrs B.P. (Beta-205063); age represents near last stage of paleosol
development

182-194+

Pre-paleosol alluvium, grayish brown to brown (10YR 5/2â3), silt, clayey, sandy,
occas. pebbles (< 8 mm dia.), massive with no visible bedding, calcareous with
abundant carbonate filaments; isolated mussel shell at 188 cm depth

Trench 1 (North), south edge of old Clear Fork channel; trench dissects the old floodplain
containing the paleosol sequence (described below) and adjacent slumped sediment along right
bank of old channel
0-47 cm

Post-paleosol alluvium, grayish brown, silt, clayey, sandy, massive with no visible
bedding, soft, earth worm traces, calcareous with no visible carbonates

47-165

West Fork paleosol, dark grayish brown, silt, clayey, sandy, massive, calcareous,
occas. faint carbonate filaments throughout (filaments absent in trench 1 south
section), soft when damp, occas. land snail shells (Rabdotus); lower 16 cm of
paleosol has low to moderate number of carbonate filaments; isolated in situ stone at
88 cm depth

165-186+

Pre-paleosol alluvium, grayish brown, silt, clayey, sandy, occas. pebble (< 10 mm
dia.), massive, hard, calcareous with large number of carbonate filaments

Within 2 meters north of the above section, the sediment exposed in the trench is a deposit of
unstratified grayish brown clayey silt that slumped into the old Clear Fork channel.
I-3

Trench 2, located just north of trench 1 in the south edge of the old Clear Fork channel
0-115+cm Mixed and pseudo-stratified deposit of limestone blocks, yellowish brown clay with
rounded gravels, grayish brown silt and clay with gravels, decaying wood; this
material represents artificial fill that was dumped in the old channel sometime within
the past 50 years
Trench 3, located in middle of old channel of Clear Fork
0-180+

cm Mixture of limestone blocks, yellowish clay with rounded gravels, brown sandy
clay with gravels; this material represent artificial fill in the old channel

Trench 4, located at lowest point in old Clear Fork channel
0-175+cm Mixture of limestone blocks and brown sandy clay with gravels; this material is
artificial fill in the old channel and means that the original channel floor (if still
intact) occurs below 2 meters or more below the present surface of the artificial fill
deposit
Trench 5, located on the slope of the north bank (inside bend) of the old Clear Fork channel;
sandy deposits (rare in the study area) may represent weak point-bar development on the inside
curve of the old channel
0-52 cm

Limestone blocks, resting on old slope of channel bank deposits; pieces of undecomposed wood at base of rubble; this debris layer at the top of the trench
exposure thickens from 15 to 75 cm north-to-south towards channel, sharp basal
contact with underlying deposits

52-172+

Medium light brown, sand, fine to very fine, lenses of sand 5-6 cm thick, calcareous
but no visible carbonates, occas. pebble, land snail shells (Rabdotus), sand bedding
discontinuous due to severe bioturbation by rodent-sized burrows; a massive block of
grayish brown clayey silt at north end of trench exposure may represent a slumped
mass of the West Fork paleosol and associated flood-terrace alluvium

Trench 6, located on the floodplain north of the old Clear Fork channel
0-65 cm

Post-paleosol alluvium, grayish brown, silt, clayey, fine sand, massive with lack of
distinct bedding, soft when damp, calcareous but with no visible carbonates, occas.
land snail shell (Rabdotus, Helicina), earthworm traces, bone fragment at 36 cm
depth; A horizon soil absent from top of sequence; AMS radiocarbon age on charcoal
from 35-42 cm depth is 150 Â± 40 14C yrs B.P. (Beta-204912)

65-160

West Fork paleosol, dark grayish brown, silt, clayey, fine-very fine sand, massive
with absence of bedding features, soft when damp, hard when dry, calcareous but no
visible carbonates, earthworm traces, lower 12 cm of paleosol has small number of
weak carbonate filaments, basal contact transitional with underlying lighter-colored
silt

I-4

160-205+

Pre-paleosol alluvium, grayish brown silt, clayey, sandy, massive with absence of
bedding, hard, calcareous with carbonate filaments in pockets, more filaments that in
lower part of paleosol; AMS radiocarbon age on charcoal from 200-205 cm depth is
2360 Â± 40 14C yrs B.P. (Beta-204913)

Trench 7, located north of and adjacent old Clear Fork channel just north of Trench 5
