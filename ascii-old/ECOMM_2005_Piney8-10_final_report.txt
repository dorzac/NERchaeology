This report documents a cultural resource inventory conducted on seven separate tracts of land totaling 1,414 acres in
Bowie, Upshur, and Marion Counties, Texas. Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of
the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting
and, in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was undertaken to ensure
that cultural resource sites located within the parcels would be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was between October 6, and November 11, 2004. Fieldwork included a 100% pedestrian
inventory accompanied by 984 shovel tests. Recovered artifacts included prehistoric flakes and ceramics, and historic
ceramics, metal, and glass. All subsurface artifacts were recovered and will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory.
Twenty-three archeological sites were documented including eight previously recorded sites and fifteen newly
discovered sites. Of these, 10 sites (41BW22, 41BW706, 41BW707, 41BW709, 41BW710, 41BW708, 41BW711, 41MR114,
41MR180, 41MR265) are assessed as not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP and no further work is warranted. The
remaining 13 sites (41BW53, 41BW62, 41BW69, 41BW712, 41MR4, 41MR227, 41MR263, 41MR264, 41MR266, 41UR310,
41UR311, 41UR312 41UR313) could not be clearly assessed using the limited shovel testing inventory tactics, and the
NRHP eligibility of sites is unknown. These sites should be avoided and protected from adverse impacts or, if they
cannot be protected, should be further investigated to clearly determine NRHP eligibility

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on seven separate tracts of land, totaling 1,414 acres, in Bowie,
Upshur, and Marion Counties in East Texas. The project area includes 885 acres in three
inventory parcels at Lake Wright Patman and 529 acres in four parcels at Lake O’ the Pines.
Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting
within the parcels, and in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act,
the inventory was undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the parcels
would be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was conducted in two sessions between October 6-15, and November 311, 2004. Fieldwork included a 100% pedestrian inventory accompanied by intensive and
systematic shovel testing. Nine hundred eighty-four shovel tests were manually excavated.
Recovered artifacts included prehistoric flakes, ceramic sherds, and historic ceramics, metal, and
glass. All subsurface artifacts were recovered and will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL).
Twenty-three archeological sites were documented within the project areas including eight
previously recorded sites and fifteen newly discovered sites. Of these, 10 sites are considered
not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and the remaining 13 sites
could not be clearly assessed using the limited shovel testing inventory tactics.
Sites 41BW22, 41BW706, 41BW707, 41BW709, 41BW710, 41BW708, 41BW711, 41MR114,
41MR180, and 41MR265 are assessed as not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP and no further
work is warranted.
The NRHP eligibility of sites 41BW53, 41BW62, 41BW69, 41BW712, 41MR4, 41MR227, 41MR263,
41MR264, 41MR266, 41UR310, 41UR311, 41UR312 and 41UR313 is unknown. These sites should
be avoided and protected from adverse impacts. If they cannot be protected, these sites should
be further investigated to clearly determine NRHP eligibility.

1.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1 THE UNDERTAKING
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs and
navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 45,063 acres at Lake Wright
Patman and 9,251 acres at Lake O’ the Pines (acreages are outside conservation pools). Much of
this acreage is forested by mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. In conjunction with the
existing management plans for the reservoirs and in accordance with accepted silviculture
methodologies, the USACE has planned certain management areas for selective timber thinning.
Commercial thinning removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through
single tree selection. Removal of crop trees often disturbs the ground surface, but extensive
subsurface disturbance is not common.
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account; therefore, in compliance with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89-665
et seq.), the inventory was authorized by the USACE to identify any archeological sites,
buildings, structures, or other resources that may be eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All inventories were conducted and all sites are located on
lands owned by the Federal Government and managed by the USACE.

1.2 LOCATION
The project area is comprised of seven separate parcels located at Lake Wright Patman in Bowie
County, and Lake O’ the Pines in Marion and Upshur Counties, Texas (Figure 1-1). Together,
the seven parcels total 1,414 acres and range in size from 56 acres (Oak Park North) to 420 acres
(Kelly Creek). The seven parcels are listed in Table 1-1.

1.2.1 Lake Wright Patman
Lake Wright Patman is on the Sulphur River 18 km southwest of Texarkana in Bowie and Cass
Counties (Figure 1-1). The far upstream portions of the reservoir extend into Morris, Titus, and
Red River Counties. Initially known as Texarkana Reservoir, the lake was renamed in the late
1970s in honor of the East Texas congressman (Breeding 2002). The dam was constructed
between 1948 and 1957 for flood-control, conservation and recreational purposes. Elevation of
the conservation pool typically varies seasonally; normal elevation in winter is 220.6 ft above
mean sea level (AMSL) and 227.5 ft. AMSL in summer. Flood storage capacity is 259.5 ft.
AMSL. During the summer the lake can cover 33,750 acres; the normal winter conservation

pool is 20,300 acres. Four parcels totaling 885 acres are currently planned for timber thinning
(Figure 1-2).

The Kelly Creek Area is located in Bowie County on the north side of Lake Wright Patman,
about 7 km south of Redwater and 18 km southwest of Texarkana (Figure 1-2). This inventory
area contains two sub-areas designated Kelly Creek East and Kelley Creek West and totals 420
acres. The western portion of USACE Kelly Creek Park is situated within the southern half of
the Kelly Creek East survey parcel. The Kelly Creek East tract measures approximately 860m
(E-W) by 1.7km (N-S), and the Kelly Creek West parcel measures about 1km (E-W) by 1.2km

1.2.2 Lake O’ the Pines
Lake O’ the Pines is located on Big Cypress Creek 14 km west of Jefferson and approximately
40 km northeast of Longview in Marion, Harrison, Morris, Upshur, and Camp Counties. The
earthen dam that formed the lake was constructed between 1955 and 1959 and impounds
approximately 18,700 surface acres of water along the Big Cypress Creek drainage. The lake is
used for flood control, recreation, and water and wildlife conservation (Breeding 2002a). Four
tracts totaling 551 acres are currently planned for timber thinning (Figure 1-3).
The Oak Park Area is located in Marion County on the north side of Lake O’ the Pines, about 5.5

1.3 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project is located in the Piney Woods region of East Texas. Forested areas in the region
included secondary growth and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands observed
during the field inventory were typically comprised of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus
echinata), and longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees were predominantly various
oaks, including southern red oak (Quercus falcate) and white oak (Quercus alba), and the
American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). Figures 1-4 and 1-5 illustrate typical landscape
views for the project.

Figure 1-5. Typical vegetation encountered on flood plains.

Wildlife common to the area included whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red fox (Vulpes
Vulpes), bobcat (Felis rufus), tree squirrels, raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphus
virginiana), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), nutria (Myocastor coypus), river
otter (Lutra Canadensis), and mink (Mustela vison). Lake habitats support a variety of turtles,
frogs and snakes, as well as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides salmoides), flathead
(Pylodictis olivaris) and channel (Ictalurus punctatus) catfish, white (Pomoxis annularis) and
black (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) crappie, white bass (Morone chrysops), bluegill (Lepomis
macrochirus), and other sunfish. Bird species include the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker
(Picoides borealis), as well as bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), osprey (Pandion
haliaetus), bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), white pelicans
(Elecanus erythrorhynchos), common loons (Gavia immer), herons, and egrets.

1.4 BEDROCK GEOLOGY AND SOILS
1.4.1 Lake Wright Patman
The bedrock geology encountered within all four project areas at Lake Wright Patman is
predominately comprised of mostly silt and sandy clay deposits of Wilcox Group undivided
(Ewi) sediments (Table 1-2) which formed approximately 40-45 million years ago during the
Middle Eocene (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality [TCEQ] 2004; Sellards et al.
1932:530). During this time period the project area would have been located within a shallowwater reef of the Kincaid Sea, which covered large areas of the North American Southeast.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 7

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

Wilcox Group formations extend approximately 200m in depth and rest on upon an upper base
of Midway Group deposits which date to the Early Eocene (Sellards et al. 1932).
Within central Bowie County, a Miocene to Pliocene aged gravel formation called ‘Bowie
Gravels’ can sometimes be seen resting upon a base of Wilcox Group geologic deposits in
upland areas along the headwaters of Elliot Creek (Peter and Cliff 1990a). The fact that Bowie
Gravels occur over Wilcox formations suggests the gravels are possibly contemporaneous to
Uvalde Gravels which were deposited during the Miocene and Pliocene epoch of the Tertiary
(ca. 23.8 – 1.8 million years ago). These gravels offered a readily available source of chert to the
Native American populations of the area.
According to Fox (1980), the four inventory parcels situated along Lake Wright Patman
contained six documented soil types which formed over the Wilcox Group (Ewi) and/or Bowie
Gravels geologic deposits, including the Woodtell, Blevins, Sawyer, Ruston, Adaton, and Sardis
soils (Table 1-2). Cultural deposits in these soils are generally fairly shallowly buried and are
adequately investigated by manual shovel testing.

1.4.2 Lake O’ the Pines
The bedrock geology encountered within the Oak Park and Longview Intake parcels is
comprised of Queen City Formation (Eqc) deposits of quartz sand (with thin beds of clay). The

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 9

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

Queen City Formation (Eqc) is a continental fluviatile deposit that was laid down during the
Middle Eocene (ca. 45-50 million years ago) by meandering rivers on a flat coastal plain. The
Queen City Formation (Eqc) extends approximately 120 meters in depth and conformably rests
upon a base of Reklaw Formation (Er) clay deposits which also date to the Middle Eocene
(Sellards et al. 1932; TCEQ 2004).
The Oak Park North and Hwy. 259 South #2 parcels are comprised of Recent Quaternary
Alluvium (Qal), which represents approximately 12,000 years of alluvial floodplain deposition
along the Big Cypress Creek drainage (Table 1-3). Within both project areas, Qal deposits
extend approximately 6-10 meters and rest upon a base of Queen City Formation (Eqc) quartz
sand (TCEQ 2004).
Due to the fact that a soil survey has not been published for Marion County, a detailed soil listing
for the three inventory parcels in Marion County (Oak Park, Oak Park North, Longview Intake)
is not available (Table 1-3). However, the three parcels mentioned above are listed as falling
under the general Bowie-Kirvin map unit (see U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1974). A detailed soil listing was possible for the single
inventory parcel (Hwy. 259 South #2) located in Upshur County (Table 1-3).

The soils encountered within all inventory parcels at Lake O’ the Pines accumulated (to varying
depths) above the Queen City Formation (Eqc) bedrock unit (TCEQ 2004) and are described as
follows:
Bowie-Kirvin soils are located primarily on upland stream divides and concave areas along small
drainage ways, and Kirvin soils are located on low, oval upland hills or convex ridgetops higher
than the Bowie soils (Roberts 1983). Other soils within this unit include Ruston, Sacul, Libert,
Tenaha, Briley and Iuka. Of the 529 acres inventoried at Lake O’ the Pines, 39% (203 of 529

acres) fell under the Bowie-Culthbert-Kirvin general map unit. Bowie soils typically have the
following pedon:
0-6 inches, brown fine sandy loam.
6-12 inches, pale brown fine sandy loam.
12-72 inches, yellowish brown sandy clay loam with red clay mottling.

Kirvin soils typically have the following pedon:

10-42 inches, red clay (Pleistocene).
42-57 inches, red cay mottled with yellow and gray clay.
57-65 inches, stratified shaly clay and sandy clay loam.

Mollville soils are deep, poorly drained, soils which form on sandy and loamy alluvial sediments
on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Of the 551 acres inventoried at Lake O’
the Pines, 18% (97 of 529 acres) fell within the Mollville soil series (Table 1-3). Mollville soils
have the following characteristic pedon:
0-3 inches, dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) very fine sandy loam.

Big Creek
Five previously recorded sites (41BW71, 75, 77, 78, 79) are located within one mile of the Big
Creek inventory parcel (Table 2-2). All of the sites were recorded by Malone in 1970 were along
the beach of Lake Wright Patman in close proximity to eroding terraces (ca.230’ AMSL). Two
of the sites (i.e., 41BW71, 77) appeared to be eroded campsites containing surface deposits of
both lithic debitage and ceramic sherds while the remaining three (i.e., 41BW75, 78, 79) are
surface lithic scatters.
Hay Meadow
Twelve previously recorded prehistoric sites (41BW20, 21, 50, 52, 59, 60, 61, 66, 67, 99, 108, 109)
and one historic site (41BW678) have been recorded within one mile of the Hay Meadow
inventory parcel (Table 2-3). All of the sites, with the exception of 41BW109 and 41BW108,
were recorded within the northern valley axis of the Elliott Creek drainage. Six of the sites
(41BW59, 60, 61, 67, 99, 109) are surface lithic scatters or campsites recorded along beaches in
close proximity to eroded terraces (ca.225’ AMSL), while the majority of apparently intact sites
(i.e., 41BW20, 21, 50, 52, 66, 108, 678) were recorded on the elevated terraces (ca.250’ AMSL) of
Elliot Creek (Table 2-3; TADF-TARL). Four of the sites (including two large villages [i.e.,

Page 14

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas
41BW21, 50]) contained artifact assemblages that date from the Early Ceramic to Late Prehistoric
periods. The one historic site (i.e., 41BW678) was recorded by Geo Marine, Inc., in 2000 and is a

mid-nineteenth century farmstead that also contained a small family cemetery.
2.1.2.2

Lake O’ the Pines

Twenty-four archeological sites have been recorded within one mile of the four Lake O’ the
Pines parcels inventoried by EComm. All the sites were recorded during previous investigations
conducted in 1957 by E. Mott Davis, in 1986 by Skipper Scott, in 1995 by Michael Turner, in
1995, 1997 and 1998 by Bo Nelson, in 2001 by Geo Marine, Inc., and in 2003 by EComm (Table

Oak Park
Twelve previously recorded sites (41MR31, 170-178, 198, 262) are located within one mile of the
Oak Park inventory parcel (Table 2-3). All of the sites recorded by Nelson in 1997 and 1998
(41MR170-178, 198) and one of the sites recorded by Davis (41MR31) were surface lithic scatters,
middens, campsites, and cemeteries located along the beach of Lake O’ the Pines in close
proximity to eroding terraces (ca. 225’ to 240’ AMSL). With the exception of 41MR198, all of

the sites recorded by Nelson contained eroded surface deposits of material that ranged in age
from Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric time periods (Table 2-3).
Approximately one kilometer of an abandoned railroad grade was noted within the Oak Park
parcel during the inventory. This historic site, 41MR262, was initially recorded by EComm in
2003 at a location on the west shore of Lake O’ the Pines, approximately 2.5 km west of the Oak
Park project area. It was the abandoned railroad grade of the Port Bolivar Iron Ore Railroad,
operational from 1912 to 1927, which previously extended across the local landscape for
approximately 50 miles (Trierweiler and Bonine 2004) . Because the route of the railroad grade
is an out-parcel within the Oak Park inventory area, it was not surveyed and site 41MR262 is not
included within the results section of this report. However, the site form has been revised and
submitted to TARL noting the expanded location of 41MR262 including the Oak Park parcel.
Oak Park North
A total of seven previously recorded sites (41MR201-207) are located within one mile of the Oak
Park North inventory parcel (Table 2-3). All of the sites were recorded by Nelson in 1998 along
the shoreline of Lake O’ the Pines in close proximity to eroding terraces (ca. 225 AMSL). In
addition, all of the sites were classified as eroded surface artifact scatters of undetermined age.
Longview Intake
A total of two previously recorded prehistoric sites (41MR115, 193) were within one mile of the
Longview Intake inventory parcel. Both sites were recorded by Nelson in 1995 (41MR115) and
1998 (41MR193) along the shoreline of Lake O’ the Pines in close proximity to eroding terraces
(ca. 225 AMSL). Site 41MR115 is an eroded campsite containing Late Caddoan cultural material
while 41MR193 is regarded as an eroded lithic scatter of undetermined age (Table 2-3).
Highway 259 South #2
Three previously recorded prehistoric sites (41MX28, 41UR155, 41UR156) were within one mile
of the Highway 259 South #2 parcel. Site 41MX28 was recorded by Scott in 1986 while
41UR155 and 41UR156 were recorded by Turner in 1995. Site 41MX28 is a large (42,250m²)
prehistoric cemetery of undetermined age located on an elevated terrace (ca. 250’ AMSL) east
and adjacent to Big Cypress Creek. Sites 41UR155 and 41UR156 are prehistoric campsites of
undetermined age located on slightly elevated terraces (ca. 235’ AMSL) north of Jones Creek
(Table 2-3).

2.2 PREHISTORIC CULTURAL FRAMEWORK
Humans have lived in the East Texas region for at least 11,000 years. The currently accepted
framework of culture history has been outlined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) in a planning
document for East Texas. This framework includes Paleo-Indian populations (prior to 7000
B.C.), Archaic (ca. 7000-200 B.C.) and Woodland (ca. 200 B.C. – A.D. 900) hunter gatherers,
through the Caddo horticultural adaptations (A.D. 900-1700). These time periods are based on

Page 16

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

changes in environment, technology, and/or population requiring cultural adaptations to meet
varying circumstances.
The prehistory of East Texas has been recorded by many archeological investigations. For
cultural-historical details of the prehistoric period, the reader is referred to Kenmotsu and
Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993a; 1995; 2004). Many small investigations have been
conducted by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) on rural developments by the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and various projects for utilities and mineral
interests. Of these small projects, the inventories crossing lowland areas have generally recorded
higher site densities than the upland inventories. Large investigations in the region generally
show that both prehistoric and historic sites were found adjacent to the floodplains on first
terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges. In general, areas around stream confluences and
on small rises within floodplains had a good to excellent chance of containing prehistoric cultural
resources while historic resources can be in more diverse conditions, including areas away from
water.
2.3 HISTORIC PERIOD
The original inhabitants of East Texas are believed to have been first contacted by Europeans
between 1528 and 1533 by the Spanish explorer, Cabeza de Vaca. This foray may have
encountered Caddo people somewhere between Nacogdoches, Texas and Natchitoches,
Louisiana. It was followed by the explorer Moscoso, whose report of crossing what may have
been the Angelina River mentions several distinct Caddo groups including the Ayish, Nondacoa,
Nasoni, Nacacahoz, and Naquisca. In 1685, the French Explorer La Salle reported Hasinai
Caddo near Nacogdoches, and in 1690 the Spanish began establishing a series of missions in the
area including one at Nacogdoches by 1716. The Spaniards reported that the local people
actively cultivated fields of maize, which they supplemented with gardens of beans, squash, and
other vegetables, as well as hunting and fishing. Trotlining was a common fishing technique and
surplus maize was often traded with neighboring people.
The Historic Period (1700-present) describes the history behind the current cultural setting of the
area and also marks a transition from the native populations to the European immigrants’
establishment of farms, towns, and counties. As the indigenous groups were exposed to
Europeans, trade items such as glass beads, metal points, buttons, and gun parts made their way
into the archeological record. Unfortunately, contact with the Europeans also brought new
diseases which severely reduced the populations of the Caddo villages. The descendants of these
Caddo people were forced out of Texas in 1859. They now live all over the country and have a
federally recognized tribal government with offices located near the town of Binger, Oklahoma.
2.3.1 Area of Lake Wright Patman
The first likely European expedition into the area around Lake Wright Patman was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition into
the southeastern U.S. and took over after he died. Looking for an overland route back to New
Spain, Moscoso crossed into the territory that became Bowie County and used existing trails
established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning around and

traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993). French visitors to the area included
Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who went to the area
to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2002b). Permanent European presence began
in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious was established by the French at a location just to the
northwest of Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as a trading
station and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years after the
Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish, under the
name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were trying to foster a
relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2002). Finally, the Americans explored the area in
1806 when the Red River Expedition launched by Thomas Jefferson traveled up the Red River to
Spanish Bluff, where they were forced to turn back by Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties began in
the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and
Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years. By
1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been resolved.
The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton plantations as
well as raising corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave population
outnumbered the white population in Bowie County, and numbered just under half in Cass
County (Harper 2002a; Harper 2002b). As was expected, the white population strongly
supported the secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took
place in the area, federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmen’s
Bureau to assist black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed
white residents, who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and they secretly
supported anti-black movements such as Cullen Baker’s gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up in
the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where two
major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the largest
trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was founded
in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding rural
community (Hazlewood 2002; Harper 2002c).
The entire area remained primarily rural with an agricultural economy, but small manufacturing
also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the
area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from
that point forward (Harper 2002a). Changes in the economic market drew many people away
from farming and into manufacturing and trade. However, populations grew slowly, if at all, and
the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Lake Wright Patman was completed in 1957 and
provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.

2.3.2 Area of Lake O’ the Pines
Much of the area around Big Cypress Creek and what would become Lake O’ the Pines
remained uninhabited for most of the eighteenth century. The first Anglo-American settlements
were formed in the 1840s, and the town of Jefferson was founded at that time. The settlers were
primarily from Tennessee and Alabama; the area of east Upshur County and Marion County
were inhabited by those from Alabama. They set up a way of life similar to what they had at
home, which included large cotton plantations using slave labor (Atkins 2002; Kirby 2002).
Jefferson quickly became a booming river port town, in fact the largest inland port in Texas.
North Texas agricultural produce was shipped to Shreveport and New Orleans, and as a result of
this connection with the Mississippi River system and factories to the east, new amenities such as
refrigeration, soda water, artificial gas for lighting, and ice production made their first
appearance as early as the 1870s (Atkins 2002). The white population supported the secession
movement and the Confederacy in the Civil War. Ordnance, rifles, and tinned food were
manufactured for the Confederate forces. Military occupation followed the Civil War, although
white suppression of the black majority continued to persist. Jefferson declined significantly in
1873 when the destruction of the “raft” – a massive log jam - on the Red River above Shreveport
reduced the water levels of Big Cypress Creek, as well as the establishment of rail transportation
in other parts of the state (Long 2002a).
Rich iron ore deposits in eastern Upshur County were mined on and off since the 1860s, but the
town of Ore City was not founded until 1911, anticipating the arrival of the Port Bolivar Iron Ore
Railroad. This railroad was chartered in December, 1910 to connect Longview with an area rich
in iron ore near Hughes Springs, a distance of about 50 miles. Construction began in 1912, but
World War I halted completion of the line and it was abandoned in 1927 (Young 2002). Ore
City operated as a mining and lumbering center, and managed to survive after these major
industries became non-operational (Long 2002b). Oil was discovered in the 1910s and gave a
boost to the manufacturing sector. The Depression dealt the area a hard blow, especially the
agricultural economy, but rising oil prices and federal assistance helped the area recover more
quickly than other areas of Texas. The economy and population of the area declined slightly
over the next 30 years, but the area moved more toward a tourist economy with the development
of urban heritage sites in Jefferson, obtaining NRHP status in 1971, as well as water recreation
from Caddo Lake State Park and Lake O’ the Pines, which were developed in the 1930s and
1950s, respectively.

3.0 FIELD METHODS
The archeological field inventory was conducted in two field sessions from October 6-15 and
from November 2-11, 2004. Sixty-four person-days were spent in the field. Methods and
density of shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements for field tactics
stipulated by the USACE (2002:10-44).

3.1 SURVEY TACTICS
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with transect lines indicated at 20 m
intervals on aerial photographs. Each field archeologist was given a copy of the aerial and was
assigned a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were designated
with an alpha prefix and individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered, so that
shovel test G-5 identified the fifth test along the seventh transect (Transect G). In general, each
crew member followed his/her own transect, walking in parallel with the other crew members.
Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crew members doubled up with one person digging the
shovel tests and another screening and recording the field forms, or two crew members would
“leapfrog” along one transect, each digging alternating shovel tests. While approximately even
coverage was attempted, surveyors were also directed to test likely locations such as topographic
rises.
Special effort was made to relocate the numerous previously recorded sites in several of the
parcels. For each of these sites, the field crew used multiple lines of evidence to ascertain the
location, or suspected location, of the site. The crew referred to the site’s plot on the USGS
topographic maps at TARL, to the original site sketch map (when on file at TARL), and to the
UTM (or latitude/longitude) coordinates of the site. Allowances were made for possible
conversion errors in coordinate systems, and for possible map plotting errors. At each suspected
location(s), the crew conducted a pedestrian inspection of the vicinity. If no surface evidence of
the site was seen, the crew shovel tested the most probable location(s) based on the above lines
of evidence.
At selected shovel tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect and shovel test locations.
Tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be preferred site
locations, such as ridge lines, knolls, and promontories. In some cases, shovel tests could not be
dug due to standing water, erosion, or steep slopes, and these locations were individually
recorded on the shovel testing log.
All shovel tests were 30 to 35 cm in diameter. All tests were dug to the bottom of the Holocene
deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm below ground surface if no clay was present. Tests
were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material
present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness and all
excavated material was screened through ¼-inch (6.4 mm) mesh.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

All cultural material within shovel tests was collected with the exception of recent objects such
as bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate recent
disturbance and were not collected. At the remaining sites, only diagnostic material and sample
collections were recovered due to high artifact quantities of the surface artifacts. All shovel tests
were backfilled.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in the
immediate vicinity at 5 to 15 m distances up to six tests in an area. If more than one of these
tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the location
was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an isolated occurrence.
The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected, but these were not
further recorded. The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were similarly investigated
using multiple shovel tests. On each site a permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch
iron re-bar fixed with an aluminum survey cap. Caps were stamped with “ECOM 2004” and with a
temporary site number for newly recorded sites and existing trinomials for prerecorded sites.
Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones
of zero or low artifact presence. Generally, these were in cardinal directions from the initial
positive test, unless topography suggested an alternative tactic. Site boundaries were defined on
on the basis of subsurface artifact distribution, complemented by topography, soil exposures, and
other relevant criteria. Additionally, sites along the shoreline were visually inspected for artifact
distribution, and site size was determined by the extent of the surface artifacts. Based on the
distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of surface artifacts, site boundaries were
prominently marked with fluorescent pink flagging tape. Sites were photographed, sketch and
mapped, and all site data was recorded onto State of Texas site data forms. All recovered
artifacts were processed and analyzed by the authors, of this report, in EComm’s Austin
laboratory, and the artifacts, notes and records will be curated at TARL upon completion of
analysis.

3.2 DENSITY OF SHOVEL TESTING
The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel
test was to be excavated per three acres (equivalent to 0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate of
coverage, a total of 466 shovel tests was the minimum required to inventory the 1,414 acres
(Table 3-1). In an attempt to ensure greater coverage than this minimum, a total of 984 shovel
tests were actually excavated, or more than double the contractual minimum. Intensity of shovel
testing varied from parcel to parcel depending on ground visibility, vegetation and topography.
Shovel Testing density varied from a minimum of 0.4 tests per acre (2.56 acres per test) at the
Big Creek parcel at Lake Wright Patman to a maximum of 1.3 tests per acre at the Longview
Intake parcel at Lake O’ the Pines. For the project as a whole, final coverage averaged about 0.7
tests per acre (1.4 acres per test).

4.0 RESULTS
The investigation of the 1,414 acres documented 23 cultural resource sites including eight
previously recorded and 15 new archeological sites. Site locations are depicted, in Appendix D,
on USGS topographic quadrangles, and completed State of Texas site forms are presented in
Appendix E. (Both appendices are restricted distribution on CD-ROM).

4.1 LAKE WRIGHT PATMAN
4.1.1 Kelly Creek
The Kelly Creek area consisted of two nonadjacent
survey areas, designated East and West, which totaled
420 acres. The two parcels were investigated using 335
shovel tests for a density of 0.80 shovel tests per acre.
Six cultural resource sites, including one previously
recorded site, were recorded within the project areas
(Table 4-1). A map showing the locations of all shovel
tests excavated within the Kelly Creek project area is
provided in Appendix A.

41BW69
Prehistoric site 41BW69 (Figures 4-1 and 4-2) was initially recorded by Alton Briggs in 1970
while conducting a shoreline inventory of Lake Wight Patman (then named Lake Texarkana) for
the New Orleans District of the USACE (Texas Archeological Data Site Form on file at the
Texas Archeological Research
Lab-oratory, University of Texas at
Austin [TADSF-TARL]). Briggs
(TADSF-TARL) described the site
as a 200-x-20m prehistoric site
located along the lake shoreline at
an elevation of 221.1 ft above sea
level (ASL). In addition, Briggs
described the site as being heavily
disturbed and surface collected by
people visiting the USACE Kelly
Creek Park (located east and
adjacent to the site).
Briggs
collected three unidentified dart
points, one point base, two biface
fragments, and an unknown
number of cores within the site
Figure 4-1. Shoreline encountered at 41BW69
(TADSF-TARL).

The site is situated on the
northern shoreline of Lake
Wright Patman within the
Kelley Creek drainage. The
topography
gradually
increases east of the site in
proximity to an elevated
ridge line.
Vegetation
within the area varied from
small cedars along the shore
to mixed hardwoods and
pine along the elevated ridge
and terrace. According to Fox
(1980), the site contains
very fine sandy loam soils
that fall within the Woodtell
series.
Based on the site map drawn
(not to scale) by Briggs in
1970, the site boundary
appears to extend along the
shoreline to the north for an
unknown distance (TADSFTARL). Since 1970, water
levels within the lake have
fluctuated greatly during dry
and wet seasons/years. At
the time of the field
inventory, the lake elevation
was approximately 225 ft
ASL, or four feet higher
than the level encountered
by Briggs in 1970. As a
result, it appears the
majority
of
cultural
resources recorded in 1970
along the shoreline are
currently below water.

Figure 4-2. Site map, 41BW69.

In addition to the pedestrian survey, a total of ten shovel tests were excavated in portions of the
site extending above water in order to determine the nature of cultural resource deposition and
site boundaries. Cultural resources were not encountered on the ground surface during the
pedestrian survey or below the surface during shovel test excavations.

41BW706
Site 41BW706 (Figures 4-3 and 4-4)
is a 30-x-19m mid-twentieth century
surface debris scatter located within
a east-west running dry arroyo that
connects to an unnamed tributary of
the Sulphur River. Erosion along
the arroyo during periods of flooding
has
apparently
removed
an
undetermined amount of topsoil
throughout the site, thus exposing
sterile Pleistocene clays just below
the surface.
The site contains
Blevins silt loam which supports
large stands of oak and pine (Fox
1980).
The typical pedon for
Blevins series soils is presented in
Chapter 1.0. Surface visibility was
approximately 20 percent.

Figure 4-3. 41BW706, facing east

During the pedestrian survey, a surface
artifact inventory was conducted within the
site in order to assess artifacts and
determine the site boundary. A total of
eleven artifacts that approximately date to
the mid-twentieth century were recorded on
the surface of the site (Table 4-2).
The brown wine bottle was produced by
the Owens-Illinois Glass Company which
started to produce bottles in the U.S. in
1929 (Glass Factory Marks on Bottles
2005). The “7” left of the trademark
indicates the bottle was specifically
manufactured at the manufacturing and
mold plant in Alton, Illinois (closed in
1978) while the “6” specifies the last digit
of the year the bottle was produced (i.e.,
1936, 1946, 1956, 1966, 1976). The blue
Vicks “Vap-O-Rub” jar was produced by
the Maryland Glass Company in Baltimore,
Maryland. The M in a circle is commonly
seen on all cobalt blue medicine jars (i.e.,
Phillips Milk of Magnesia, Bromo-Seltzer,
Vicks) produced by the company between
1921 to ca. 1970.

Due to the location of the site within an arroyo, it was determined that intensive shovel testing
within the drainage feature would not be appropriate. However, two shovel tests were excavated
along the banks of the arroyo in order to record the nature of soil deposition and also check for
possible shallowly buried cultural components. Cultural material was not encountered within the
two shovel tests excavated within the site. Sterile Pleistocene clay (5YR5/6) was exposed during
shovel testing between 10-30 cmbs.
Prior to conducting fieldwork, archival
research was conducted in order to ascertain
the locations of possible historic structures.
Aerial photographs of the project area taken in
1949, 1954, 1960, and 1970 were examined.
On aerial photographs taken between 1949
and 1960, the project area is shown as being
cleared of trees and utilized as an agricultural
field with no apparent structures. Sometime
between 1960 and 1970 the project area was
planted with timber and ephemeral 2-track
roads (possibly relating to logging activities)
are evident in close proximity to the project
area.
41BW707
Site 41BW707 (Figures 4-5 and 4-6) is a 48-x28m early to mid twentieth century surface
artifact scatter located along the edge and
northern talus slope of a heavily wooded

Typical vegetation encountered
within the site included mixed
hardwoods and pine (Figure 45). The site contains Woodtell
very fine sandy loam (Fox
1980). The typical pedon for
Woodtell
series
soils
is
presented in Chapter 1.0.
Erosion has probably impacted
an undetermined amount of the
sites topsoil. Surface visibility
was approximately 20 percent.
During the pedestrian survey, a
surface artifact inventory was
conducted within the site in
order to assess the temporal
origin of artifacts and site
boundary.
A total of 56
artifacts that approximately date
to the early to mid twentieth
century were recorded on the
surface of the site (Table 4-3).
The clear glass bottle with the
label “Monticello Illinois” “Dr.
W.B. Caldwell Div” was
manufactured by Dr. W.B.
Caldwell Co., Division of
Sterling Drugs, Inc. in 1943 and
contained a pepsin syrup

laxative (History of the Pepsin
Syrup Company 2005). The three “Ball” mason jars found on the site feature a design that was
first marketed by the Ball Bros Glass Company and sold after 1933. The clear glass bottle with
the “J R Watkins Co” makers mark is similar in appearance to bottles manufactured by the J.R.
Watkins Company during the 1930’s containing machine oil. The blue Vicks “Vap-O-Rub” jar
was produced by the Maryland Glass Company in Baltimore, Maryland (Glass Factory Makers
Marks on Bottles 2005).
Five shovel tests were excavated within the site in order to assess cultural resource deposition
and site boundaries. All five shovel tests did not contain cultural resources. Sterile Pleistocene
clay was encountered between 30-60 cmbs during excavations.
Prior to conducting fieldwork, archival research was conducted to ascertain the locations of
possible historic structures. Aerial photographs of the project area taken in 1949, 1954, 1960,
1970, and 1995 were examined. Between 1949 and 1954 the site location is shown within a

lightly wooded area that was not utilized for agriculture and had no visible structures. On the
photographs taken between 1960 and 1995 the site is shown within a heavily wooded area. This
suggests that timber planting within the immediate site location occurred sometime between
1954 and 1960.

41BW709
Prior to conducting fieldwork, archival research was conducted in order to ascertain the locations
of possible historic structures. Aerial photographs taken within the project area on 1949, 1954,
1960, 1970, and 1995 were reviewed. During this analysis, one historic homestead (i.e.,
41BW709) was discovered within the Kelly Creek East project area on aerials taken between
1949 and 1970. According to a neighbor, the homestead was resided in and constructed by a Mr.
Charlie Rogers in 1905 and was subsequently razed some time after USACE took control of the
property (Kenneth Strickland, personnel communication 2005). The information regarding the
date the structure was razed appears to be corroborated when one compares the aerials taken on
1970 and 1995.
41BW709 (Figures 4-9 and 4-10) is a
97-x-91m early twentieth century
homestead located within a heavily
wooded upland setting (270 AMSL)
approximately 220m west of an
unnamed drainage which flows south
into Lake Wright Patman. Vegetation
within the site included thick stands of
mixed hardwoods and pine (Figure 49). The site contains Blevins silt loam
(Fox 1980). The typical pedon for
Blevins series soils is presented in
Chapter 1.0. No natural or artificial
disturbances were observed within the
confines of the site. Surface visibility
was approximately 20 percent.

As noted, the main structure for
the site was bulldozed in 1972.
During the survey, the area where
this structure once stood was
overgrown with thick vegetation
and no material evidence of the
structure was identified on the
surface.
However, the bulldozed remnant
of possible brick lined patio
(Feature 1) was identified during
the pedestrian survey in the westcentral portion of the site (Figure
4-11). Feature 1 occupied an area
approximately 5-x-7m in size and
consisted of approximately 15
bricks stamped “Atlanta Texas”
set side by side in the ground with
no apparent mortar. According to
Steinbomer (1983), bricks with the
“Atlanta Texas” makers mark were
produced by the Atlanta Brick
Company in Atlanta, Texas between
1915 and 1940.
In addition, during the pedestrian
survey a pile of fifteen 7’ long
railroad ties was recorded in the
northern portion of the site (Figure
4-9). The railroad ties were former
fence posts that were probably
removed in the early 1970’s when
the site was demolished.
An inventory of surface artifacts
was conducted within the site in
order to assess the temporal origin
of artifacts and site boundary. A
total of 25 artifacts were recorded on
the surface of the site (Table 4-5).
Diagnostic material consisted of 15
ca. 1915-1940 bricks and one clear
glass bottle manufactured by the
Owens-Illinois Glass Company
ca.1929+ (Table 4-5).

Seven shovel tests were excavated in order to assess cultural resource deposition and site
boundaries. None of the seven shovel tests contained any cultural resources. Sterile Pleistocene
clay was encountered between 20-40 cmbs during excavations.
41BW710
Site 41BW710 (Figures 4-12 and 413) is a 100-x-130 m location of a
razed early to mid twentieth
century homestead located within
a cleared grass field (260’ AMSL)
approximately 500m south of
Farm Road 2624.
Vegetation
within the site included high
grasses surrounded by thick stands
of mixed hardwoods and pine
(Figure 4-12). The site contains
Blevins silt loam (Fox 1980). The
typical pedon for Blevins series
soils is presented in Chapter 1.
Surface
visibility
was
approximately
20
percent.
According to a nearby neighbor,
Figure 4-12. 41BW710, facing south
the general site area was possibly
inhabited during the early to mid
twentieth century by family members of a Mr. Pink Rogers (Kenneth Strickland, personnel
communication 2005). As mentioned above, Charlie Rogers (the son of Pink Rogers) reportedly
inhabited the nearby location of 41BW709.
While conducting the pedestrian survey, the bulldozed remnants of a chimney (Feature 1) were
recorded in the central portion of the site (Figure 4-14). Feature 1 occupied an area 3-x-10 m in
size and consisted of approximately 40 locally produced bricks with no makers mark . At the
time of collapse the chimney apparently toppled over in a southwesterly direction, thus
dispersing bricks approximately 8 meters in that general direction. No other artifacts or features
were encountered on the surface during the pedestrian survey.

Nine shovel tests were
excavated in order to assess
cultural resource deposition
and site boundaries. A
total of 72 artifacts that
date from the early to mid
twentieth century were
recovered between 0-40
cmbs in seven of the nine
shovel tests excavated
(Table 4-6). Due to the
fact that the site was razed,
many of the artifacts were
recorded in mixed contexts
(e.g., modern glass below
ca. 1900 window glass in
ST3). Interestingly, some
of the artifacts (i.e., one
brown glass in ST1B and
two aqua glass fragments
in ST2B) appeared to show
damage from intensive
exposure to heat.
This
could possibly indicate the
site was heavily damaged
by fire before or after
demolition. Sterile Pleistocene clay (5YR4/6) was
encountered throughout the
site at shallow depths
ranging from 10 to 45
cmbs.

within the southern valley axis of the
Big Creek drainage. A large drainage
feature is located immediately north
of the site. In all likelihood, erosion
has impacted an undetermined
amount of soils in the northern
portion of the site in proximity to the
ridge line. According to Fox (1980),
the site contains Ruston series fine
sandy loam. The typical pedon for
Ruston soils is presented in Chapter
1.0. Large stands of loblolly and
shortleaf pine were observed within
the site (Figure 4-15).
Surface
visibility was approximately 20

In addition to conducting a pedestrian
survey, a total of seven shovel tests
were excavated in order to determine
the nature of cultural resource
deposition and site boundaries. A
total of two lithic artifacts were

(AB2, 1W) of the seven shovel tests
excavated. Sterile Pleistocene clay
(5YR5/6) was encountered during
shovel testing at depths ranging

Stephenson in 1949 and was described as
a prehistoric site of undetermined size
located within an agricultural field along a
low sandy ridge west and adjacent to a
small tributary of Elliot Creek. At
41BW22,
Stephenson collected an
unknown number of unidentified points,
ceramics, and scrapers (TADSF-TARL).
The site is a 45-x-60 m prehistoric site of
undetermined age located east and
adjacent to Fleming Creek along an
elevated T2 and T1 terrace that ranges in
elevation between 260’ (AMSL) on the
western T2 terrace to 250’ (AMSL) on the
eastern T1 terrace. Vegetation within the
site varies from a grass field in the western
portion of the site to mixed hardwoods
and pines in the eastern portion of the site
(Figure 4-17).
Natural and artificial disturbances
identified within the site include: probable
erosion on the eastern portion of the site in
proximity to Fleming Creek; and a northsouth running 2-track road and irrigation
ditch in the western portion of the site
(Figure 4-17). According to Fox (1980),
the site contains Sawyer series silt loam.

41BW53
Prehistoric site 41BW53 (Figures 4-19 and 4-20) was initially recorded by Alton Briggs and
James Malone in 1970 while conducting a shoreline inventory of Lake Texarkana (currently
named Wright Patman) for the USACE (Briggs and Malone 1970; TADSF-TARL). Site
41BW53 was a large 200-x-75 m prehistoric site located along an elevated bluff overlooking
Lake Texarkana to the south.
Within the site they recorded
one large truncated or conical
mound (with deep looters pits)
that had a possible ramp on the
western face; a possible village
area of undetermined size
located north of the mound; and
a possible rectangular mound or
midden
located
an
undetermined distance west of
the truncated/conical mound.
During this original inventory,
one test pit of undetermined
size was excavated within an
unknown portion of 41BW53
resulting in the collection of a
non-specified number of flint
flakes, ceramics (type not
Figure 4-19. Archeologist excavating a shovel test on
specified), and points (type not
41BW53.
specified) (TADSF-TARL).

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

The site is recorded as a 360-x-100
m prehistoric probable village
located along an elevated terrace
situated within the northern valley
axis of the Elliot Creek drainage.
The terrace ranges in elevation
between 250’ AMSL in the central
portion of the site to 230’ AMSL in
the southern portion where the
terrace forms a peninsula that
extends into Lake Wright Patman.
Vegetation in the site varies from a
grass field along the upper terrace
to mixed hardwoods and pine in the
southern portion of the site in
proximity to Lake Wright Patman
(Figure 4-19). Natural and artificial
impacts identified within the site
include: 1) probable erosion has
impacted the east and southern
portions of the site in proximity to
Lake Wright Patman and Fleming
Creek; 2) a path has been bulldozed
in the northern portion of the site
where an east-west running
electrical power line is located; and
3) a deep hole was excavated within
the northern portion of the site in
order to install a large electrical line
tower.
According to Fox (1980), the site
contains Sawyer series silt loam.
The typical pedon for Sawyer soils
is presented in Chapter 1.0 Surface
visibility was approximately 25
percent.

Figure 4-20. Site map, 41BW53.

During the pedestrian survey, the cultural features identified by Briggs and Malone in 1970 (i.e.,
two mounds, ramp) were not apparent within the project area. However, an area that possibly
corresponds to what Briggs and Malone described as a “mound with ramp” was observed along a
peninsula which extends past the designated project boundary to the southeast (Figure 4-20).
The portion of the site within the current project area appears to correlate with what Briggs and
Malone described on a site map (drawn not to scale) as the “estimated village area” (TADSFTARL).

Nineteen shovel tests were excavated and a total of 82 artifacts were recovered between 0-40
cmbs in 11 of the 19 shovel tests excavated (Table 4-9). Seventy-four percent (61 of 82) of all

The possible Colbert point compares favorable to that illustrated by Turner and Hester
(1993:209) and was comprised of a yellowish brown (10YR5/8) chert and measured 1.7-x-1.2

The specimen has a high degree of luster and was possibly heat-treated prior to use.
One drill was collected between 0-20 cmbs in ST5. The specimen was comprised of black
(10YR2/1) chert and measured 2-x-1.5 cm (Figure 4-22). A noticeable hinge fracture is apparent
on the proximal end of the drill where the tip is missing.

41BW62
Prehistoric site 41BW62 (Figures
4-23 and 4-24) was initially
recorded by James Malone in
1970
while
conducting
a
shoreline inventory of Lake
Texarkana (currently named
Wright Patman).
Malone
described 41BW62 as a prehistoric
site over 100 square meters in
size located on the crest and SW
slope of a hill. During the survey,
Malone conducted a surface
collection within an unknown
portion of the site and collected
an unknown number of lithic
flakes (TADSF-TARL).
The original location coordinates
provided by Malone centered on a
point located within a swampy,

boundary. However, during the
inventory the hill described by
Malone appeared to closely
resemble
the
topography
encountered on an elevated
terrace (240 AMSL) located
along the northern axis of the
Elliot Creek drainage. Vegetation
within the terrace was comprised
of young hardwoods and pine
(Figure 4-23). The only disturbances

noted within this portion of the
project area consisted of erosion
along the western edge of the
terrace. According to Fox (1980),
the area contains Sawyer series
silt loam. The typical pedon for
Sawyer soils is presented in
Chapter 1.0. Surface visibility
was approximately 25 percent.
In addition to the pedestrian
survey, EComm excavated six

shovel tests on the western terrace
based on: 1) the areas topographic
similarity to Malone’s site description; and 2) Malone’s generalized description (i.e., over 100
square meters) of the sites boundaries. Cultural resources were not encountered on the surface
during the pedestrian survey or below surface during shovel test excavation.
41BW712
Site 41BW712 (Figures 4-25 and 426) is a 42-x-40m site located east
and adjacent to Fleming Creek on a
slightly elevated and frequently
flooded terrace. Vegetation in the site
consisted of stands of mixed
hardwoods and pine (Figure 4-25).
According to Fox (1980), the site
contains Sardis series silt loam. The
typical pedon for Sardis soils is
presented in Chapter 1. Erosion
along the eastern bank of Fleming
Creek appears to be undercutting

terrace deposits in the extreme western
portion of the site. In addition, erosion
appears to have removed a significant
amount of Holocene aged topsoil
throughout the entire site and exposed an
upland deposit of Bowie Gravels at shallow
depths. Given the large quantity of gravels
and close proximity of three large village
sites (i.e., 41BW21, 50, 53) within one mile
of the project area, the site probably
functioned as a lithic quarry/workshop for
the local prehistoric inhabitants. Surface
visibility was approximately 25 percent.
In addition to the pedestrian survey, a total
of twelve shovel tests were excavated in
order to determine the nature of cultural
resource deposition and site boundaries.
During excavations, large quantities of
gravels were encountered in all shovel tests
excavated. A total of twenty artifacts were
recovered between 0-40 cmbs in five of the
twelve shovel tests excavated (Table 4-11).
Internal and external flakes comprised 85%
(17 of 20) of all material (Table 4-11). Due
to dense gravel concentrations, the
maximum depths attained for shovel tests
within the site ranged between 40-120
cmbs.

4.2 LAKE O’ THE PINES
4.2.1 Oak Park
The Oak Park area totaled 112
acres and was completely
inventoried using 90 shovel tests
for a density of 0.80 shovel tests
per acre. One cultural resource
site was present. A map showing
the locations of all shovel tests
excavated within the Oak Park
area is provided in Appendix A.
41MR4
Prehistoric site 41MR4 (Figures
4-27 and 4-28) was initially
recorded by E. Mott Davis in
1957 while conducting a surface
recon-naissance
within
the
extreme western portion of the
Oak Park parcel (TADSFTARL).
During
the
reconnaissance, Davis noted one
45-x-30m “flat-topped mound”
that appeared to have been
extensively looted.

Figure 4-27. 41MR4, facing south.

In 1958, the site was revisited by
Davis and R. Stevenson (TADSFTARL) who conducted a surface
collection on the mound and
collected an unknown number of
unidentified ceramic sherds and
lithic debitage.
In addition,
Davis and Stevenson reported
that the proposed construction of
a nearby water intake by the
Mims Water Supply Company
would destroy the mound
(TADSF-TARL).
Only a small portion of the
originally recorded site area is
located on USACE fee lands
Figure 4-28. Site map, 41MR4
Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 45

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

(Figure 4-28). According to site maps maintained at TARL, 41MR4 measured about 400-x300m.
Over the years the site has been moderately to severely impacted by construction activities.
These have included the early twentieth century raised railroad grade of the Port Bolivar Iron
Ore Railroad thru the southern portion of the site; the 1960 water intake and associated facilities
on the western portion of the site; and one paved and three unimproved dirt roads in the central
and southern portions of the site. Large portions of the site were severely impacted and cleared
for the construction of the water intake and pipelines by the Mims Water Supply Company. This
portion of the site, west of the USACE fee lands, is probably the location of the ‘flat-topped
mound” noted by Davis and has been largely destroyed. In addition, the western portion of the
site has probably been impacted by erosion from the waves of nearby Lake O’ the Pines.
The site is located east and adjacent to Lake O’ the Pines within the northern valley axis of the
Big Cypress Creek drainage. Topography within the site ranges in elevation from 300’ AMSL
along the northern elevated terrace to 230’ AMSL in the western portion of the site by Lake O’
the Pines. Vegetation within the small portion of the site that extended into the USACE project
area was comprised of young stands of various hardwoods and pine. West of the USACE fee
lands, the terrain is highly eroded. Soils within the site fall within the Bowie-Kirvin map unit.
The typical pedon for these soil types is presented in Chapter 1.0. Surface visibility was
approximately 20 percent.
Sixteen shovel tests were excavated within the USACE fee lands portion of the site and a total of
only four lithic artifacts were recovered between 0-70 cmbs in four of the sixteen shovel tests
(Table 4-12). In addition, one non-diagnostic ceramic sherd was recovered in STC1 between 020 cmbs. A detailed analysis of the ceramic recovered within the site is presented in Appendix C.
Sterile Pleistocene clay (5YR5/6) was encountered during shovel testing at depths ranging
between 50-100 cmbs (Table 4-12).

for a density of 0.98 shovel tests
per acre. Two cultural resource
sites were present.
A map
showing the locations of all

41MR265
41MR265 is a prehistoric site of

undetermined age measuring 37x-24m in size. It is located on a
small frequently flooded terrace
(275 AMSL) within the northern
valley axis of the Big Cypress
Creek drainage (Figures 4-29 and
4-30). A small arroyo runs thru
the northern portion of the site in
an east to west direction. Erosion
along the arroyo and terrace has
removed an undetermined amount
of topsoil throughout the site.
Typical vegetation encountered
within the site included mixed
hardwood and pine (Figure 4-30).
Soils within the site fall within the
Bowie-Kirvin map unit. The
typical pedon for this soil type is
presented in Chapter 1. Surface
visibility was approximately 20

41MR266
41MR266 is a 38-x-35m
prehistoric site situated in a
floodplain at 230’ AMSL. It is
within the northern valley axis of
the Big Cypress Creek drainage
and approximately 60m south of
an unnamed drainage (Figures 431 and 4-32). Soils observed
within the site were alluvially
deposited within the floodplain
during flooding episodes along
the unnamed drainage. The
typical pedon for this soil type is
presented in Chapter 1.0.
Vegetation encountered within
the
site
included
mixed
hardwood and pine (Figure 431).
Surface visibility was
approximately 20 percent.
In addition to the pedestrian
survey, a total of ten shovel tests

Page 48

Figure 4-31. 41MR266, facing south.

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

were excavated in order to
determine the nature of cultural
resource deposition and site
boundaries. A total of two grogtempered non-diagnostic ceramic
sherds were recovered between
40-60 cmbs in two of the ten
shovel tests excavated (Table 414). A detailed analysis of both
sherds is presented in Appendix
C.
The soil pedon consisted of deep
floodplain alluvium that featured
distinct horizons with abrupt
lower boundaries. Due to the
proximity of Lake O’ the Pines,
the water became increasingly
saturated
with
depth.
Accordingly,
the
maximum
depths
attained
during
excavations within the site ranged
between 50-80 cmbs (Table 4-14).

41MR114
Prehistoric site 41MR114 (Figures
4-33 and 4-34) was originally
recorded by Bo Nelson in 1996
while conducting a survey along the
shoreline of Lake O’ the Pines
approximately 100m east of an
unnamed tributary of Big Cypress
Creek. Nelson described 41MR114
as an archaic site of undetermined
size located along an exposed beach
and speculated that the boundaries
possibly extended to the south onto
an elevated terrace/bluff (TADSFTARL).

Figure 4-33. 41MR114, facing east.

During the survey, Nelson recorded and collected four lithic flakes and one unidentified dart
point on the surface of the beach. According to Nelson, the site had been impacted by wave
erosion and extensively looted by multiple point collectors (TADS-TARL). At the time of this
survey, the lake water level was approximately 228’ AMSL.
In 1997, 41MR114 was revisited and shovel
tested by archeologist William Moore while
conducting a survey for the USACE and the
City of Longview for a proposed water pump
station. During the survey, Moore excavated
thirteen shovel tests along the edge of the
elevated terrace described by Nelson in 1996
and collected numerous artifacts (i.e., one
point and FCR, six flakes, six ceramic
sherds) within a single cultural component
that extended 20-70 cmbs (TADSF-TARL).
Based on the ceramics collected during
excavations, Moore defined 41MR114 as a
30-x-60m Middle to Late Caddoan campsite
located along the northern edge of an
elevated bluff which had been extensively
undercut by waves from the encroaching
waters of Lake O’ the Pines (Moore 1998).
At the time of this survey, the lake water
level was approximately 230’ AMSL.
Moore estimated that as much as 80% of the
site to the north had been destroyed by wave
erosion (TADSF-TARL).
Figure 4-34. Site map, 41MR114.
Page 50

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

As previously stated, in 1997 the site was recorded by William Moore on an elevated terrace
(240’ AMSL) adjacent to Lake O’ the Pines within the southern valley axis of the Big Cypress
Creek drainage. Since 1997, wave erosion and down slope erosion along the bluff has removed a
large portion of the terrace that was recorded by Moore in 1997 thus, completely impacting intact
portions of 41MR114 located on the former terrace and covering it with lake water. However, a
small area of what was the extreme southern portion of the site in 1997 is located along an
exposed beach (Figure 4-33). In this portion of the site all the artifacts were observed deflated on
the surface within a palimpsest that represents a secondary disturbed context.
Since the site was visited by Moore in 1997, water levels within the lake have fluctuated between
227’ AMSL to a high of 244’ AMSL recorded in March 2001 (2005 U. S. Army Corps of
Engineers, Ft. Worth District, Reservoir Control Office). One could speculate that the majority
of the site was destroyed by accelerated erosion in 2001 when lake water levels were high and
the majority of the site recorded by Moore in 1997 was underwater. Soils within the surveyed
area fall within the Bowie-Kirvin map unit. The typical pedon for these soil types is presented in
Chapter 1. Vegetation within the area included mixed hardwood and pine. Surface visibility was
approximately 20 percent on the terrace and 90% along the beach.
While conducting the pedestrian survey, a surface inventory was conducted along the beach
where ceramic sherds were observed within a secondary surface context (Figure 4-34). Within
this area a total of 19 ceramic sherds were recorded and collected in order to aid in defining a
general occupational chronology for the site. The ceramics collected on the site generally
correspond with Moore’s initial assessment of an occupation that dates from the Middle to Late
Caddoan period (1200-1500 AD) (see Appendix C).
A total of five shovel tests were excavated south of the site along an elevated terrace where wave
erosion had not impacted the integrity of soils (Figure 4-34). None of the five shovel tests
contained any cultural material. Shovel tests were not excavated on the beach due to: 1) the
disturbed/eroded context of the beach matrix; and 2) the shallow water table depth (ca. 5 cmbs).
In addition, during the pedestrian survey EComm thoroughly inspected the terrace cut-bank and
found no cultural material eroding from the exposed southern profile.
41MR180
41MR180 (Figures 4-35 and 4-36) was

initially recorded by William Moore in
1997 while conducting a survey for the
USACE and the City of Longview for a
proposed water pump station. Moore
described 41MR180 as a prehistoric site
of undetermined size located on an
elevated terrace overlooking the
floodplain and lower terraces along Big
Cyprus
Creek
(TADSF-TARL).
During the survey, Moore excavated
one shovel test within the site and
Figure 4-35. 41MR180, facing east.
Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 51

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

recovered two lithic flakes between 10 and 50 cmbs. According to Moore, approximately 80% of
the site had been impacted by erosion along Lake O’ the Pines. At the time of this survey, the
lake water level was approximately 230’ AMSL.
After reviewing earlier findings,
Perttula and Nelson (1998) concluded
that 41MR180 and the former location
of 41MR162 (currently 100% impacted
by the pump station) to be actually one
site (designated 41MR162/180) which
is approximately 200-x-300m in size
(Figure 4-36). According to Perttula
and Nelson (1998) the overall low
density of artifacts combined with the
overall lack of FCR and features, and
shallow depth of Pleistocene soils
suggests
the
probability
of
encountering buried archaeo-logical
components within the site to be low.

approximately 200-x-300m in size and
is currently located on an elevated
terrace (240’ AMSL) that overlooks
Lake O’ the Pines to the north and the
Longview Pump Station to the east
(Figure 4-36). During the survey, the
following disturbances were noted
within the site: 1) erosion along the
northern terrace bank; 2) an east-west
running path had been bulldozed thru
the central portion of the site while
bank stabilization activities were being
conducted along the western terrace
bank; and 3) a recently constructed

running road were observed on the
former location of 41MR162 in the central portion of the site. Soils within the site area fall
within the Bowie-Kirvin map unit. The typical pedon for these soil types is presented in Chapter
1.0. Vegetation within the area included mixed hardwood and pine. Surface visibility was
approximately 20 percent.
41MR180

In addition to the pedestrian survey, a total of fifteen shovel tests were excavated within the site
boundary described by Perttula and Nelson in 1998 (Figure 4-36). Cultural material was not
encountered in all fifteen shovel tests. As was previously indicated by Perttula and Nelson
(1998), Pleistocene clays occur within the site at relatively shallow depths. During the

41MR227
Site 41MR227 (Figures 4-37 and 438) was initially recorded by Bo
Nelson and Tim Perttula in 1999
while conducting an independent
non-funded survey pursuant to an
ARPA permit issued by the USACE
(TADSF-TARL).
Nelson
and
Perttula describe the site as a 100-x100m prehistoric campsite located
along the northern shoreline of Lake
O’ the Pines approximately 100m
east of an unnamed tributary to Big
Cypress Creek. At 41MR227, Nelson
and Perttula excavated three shovels
tests and recovered a total of two
flakes, one ceramic sherd, and one
FCR between 0-100 cmbs (TADSFTARL).

has probably impacted portions of
the site located in proximity to the
lake. Typical vegetation within the
site included mixed hardwood and
pine. Soils within the site fall within

5.0 HISTORIC CONTEXTS
The NHPA of 1966, as amended, [16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.] created the NRHP to preserve and
protect important aspects of our nation’s cultural heritage. Among other actions, the Act directs
federal agencies to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties located on
their land or controlled by them and further stipulates that such agencies must take into account
the effects of their actions on cultural resources. Pursuant to this direction, agencies are required
to locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all properties owned or under
their control that appear to qualify for inclusion on the NRHP.
Eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP is specified at 36 CFR part 60 and is restricted to
properties that possess “significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering,
and culture…”; that possess “integrity”; and that meet certain further criteria. Of four criteria,
archeological properties are nearly always assessed under criterion (d) which specifies properties
“that have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or history.”
In practice, the NRHP eligibility of an archeological site is generally determined by matching the
formal attributes of the site (its date, type, size, artifact content, etc.) to previously developed
“historic contexts”. These are broad research themes that identify key research questions,
together with the types of data that are necessary to satisfactorily address them. Sites that
possess data types that can address many of the research questions are determined to be
significant; sites that possess few or no such data types are considered to be not significant.
This chapter briefly summarizes several historic contexts which are commonly applied to
evaluate the significance of archeological sites in East Texas. The contexts are closely adapted
from those developed by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), and the reader is directed to
that comprehensive planning document for the essential details for each of the following
contextual themes. For Northeast Texas, four broad research contexts are here identified: (1)
early hunter-gatherer mobility; (2) the emergence of sedentism; (3) the development of
agriculture; and (4) the effects of European contact. An overview of each of these themes is
summarized below, focusing on the data needs that can be used to infer the research value of a
given site.

5.1 HUNTER GATHERER MOBILITY
Questions of hunter-gather mobility in Northeast Texas have been most fully developed by
Fields and Tomka (1993: 69-96) and focus on the Paleoindian Period from 9,500 to 7,000 B.C.
and the Archaic Period from about 7,000 to 200 B.C. This time range overlaps marginally with
that identified in the Emergence of Sedentism context. Archeological knowledge of this period
is still broadly sketched in many aspects and the research needs that are identified under this
context are fairly basic. Important new research under this context will focus on the following
topics:

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 65

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

5.1.1 Chronology and Typology
Additional well-controlled chronometric information associated with a variety of site types and
artifact types is needed to refine the fundamental space-time systematics for this broad time
range in Northeast Texas.
5.1.2 Settlement Systems
Research is necessary to better understand the variability between different non-sedentary
settlements. New information is needed about the relative permanence of settlements, their
intensity of occupation, and general land use strategies. Observations about the internal
configurations of residential sites and the degree of variability between these are critical.
5.1.3 Subsistence
Much more information is needed regarding the diversity of food resources which contributed to
human diet during this time period and to changes in the resource mix over time. Especially
interesting will be research examining the relative contributions of plant and animal taxa, and the
decision-making framework that determined which resources were economically exploited. In
addition, stable isotope analyses of human skeletal remains are called for to provide for indirect
reconstruction of diet.
5.1.4 Trade and Exchange
New research should seek to better understand the role of local and regional trade systems,
especially with regards to the acquisition of key non-food resources such as lithic raw materials
and status goods. Such research will inform on the nature and extent of territorial ranges, the
isolation and stability of populations and the development of inter-group exchange networks.
5.1.5 Technology and Change
More investigation is warranted into the complex interrelationships between food-getting
strategies, group mobility, and technology, especially with regards to changes over time in lithic
tools and alternative manufacturing processes.

5.2 THE EMERGENCE OF SEDENTISM
The transition from mobile to sedentary populations in northeast Texas, and the consequent
increase in overall cultural complexity is still poorly understood. This historic context focuses
on the period from about 500 B.C to A.D. 1000, including the Late Archaic Period from about
500 to 200 B.C., the Early Ceramic Period to A.D. 800 and the Formative Caddoan Period from
A.D. 800 to 1000. The synthesis of Perttula, et al. (1993: 97-120) develops a diverse suite of
research objectives including the following:

Page 66

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

5.2.1 Settlement Systems
To understand the process and tempo of increasing sedentism during the Late Archaic and Early
Ceramic Periods, new data are needed about the population sizes and spatial distribution of
settlements, their successful duration, and their general land use strategies. As with the
comparable focus under the Hunter Gatherer Mobility context, observations about the internal
configuration of residential sites will be important, including the diversity and ubiquity of feature
types.
5.2.2 Subsistence
More research is warranted into changes in resource selection and procurement in response to
increasing sedentism. Key questions will focus on which resources were replaced by
horticulture, and to what degree, and the nature of the relationships between increasing
population size, reduced mobility, and resource procurement.
5.2.3 Social Systems
As sedentism increased in Northeast Texas, social organization and political structures changed.
An increased understanding of these changes will examine community hierarchies, ceremonial
activities, and political and social stratification through analyses of diversity in mound features
and status goods and their spatial distributions.
5.2.4 Demography and Health
Reliable data are needed that inform on changes and trends in regional and local population sizes
and densities and in the spatial distribution of populations across the landscape. In addition,
isotopic and forensic examinations of well-dated human skeletal assemblages will be key sources
of information about human health and demography.
5.2.5 Mortuary Practices
As human populations became increasingly sedentary during this time period, their treatment of
the dead changed. Important new research will examine the development of formal cemeteries
during this period, including the differences in mound and non-mound burials, and between
cremations and flexed interments through the acquisition of new basic burial data, including
grave goods.
5.2.6 Trade and Exchange
With increased sedentism and the related potential for increased complexity in material goods
came the development of new economic exchange networks. Valuable research in Northeast
Texas will address the relationships between politics and these economic networks, especially
the political controls over access to raw materials and the political relationships between
archeological sites that may be “central places”. Research should also examine changes over
time in these intra-regional and inter-regional interaction patterns.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

5.2.7 Technological Change and Ceramics
Increased sedentism and the development of new subsistence strategies were accompanied by a
suite of new technologies. The timing and distribution of these are important keys to
understanding culture change in general during this period. Especially, the introduction of
ceramics suggests a decrease in mobility as well as increased storage capacity and changes in
horticultural production strategies. Early ceramic manufacturing strategies need research,
including selection of raw materials. Other technological attributes of sedentism include storage
facilities and permanent architecture.

5.3 THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE
The adoption of agriculture in Northeast Texas during the Caddoan Period from about A.D. 800
to 1680 was arguably the most important cultural innovation to date, creating an increasingly
intense positive feedback loop between sedentism, population size, and technological change.
The research themes under this historic context have been most succinctly treated by Perttula
(1993a: 121-146) and include the following:
5.3.1 Subsistence Patterns
Key to understanding human adaptations during this period are changes in the economic resource
mix, especially timing and extent of the shift from the opportunistic horticulture of native
cultigens to intensive maize cultivation. Isotopic analyses of skeletal assemblages will provide
valuable inferences on human diet.
5.3.2 Settlement Systems
As agriculture became the dominant food-getting strategy, changes occurred in the preferred
places for habitation, in the relationships between populations within a region, and in the internal
complexity of habitations. These developments may be examined though examining changes in
architecture, settlement composition and arrangement, and diversity in overall settlement sizes.
Research should look at the composition and internal arrangement of farming communities and
their relationships to ceremonial centers. Additional knowledge of trail systems between
population centers and ceremonial centers are needed.
5.3.3 Social and Political Complexity
Significant changes in political organizations were facilitated by agriculture and sedentism. The
examination of the distribution of status goods and the development of public architecture will
provide insights into political structures, as will the analysis of the hierarchical complexity of
settlement types.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

5.3.4 Demography
The adoption of agriculture fundamentally changed human societies in Northeast Texas. A
detailed understanding of the timing, intensity, and spatial distribution of changes in population
sizes, both positive and negative, will allow a deeper understanding of the adoption of
agriculture. A regional analysis of habitation sites will provide a broad perspective, while
forensic examination of skeletal assemblages will provide detailed inform on population
structures.
5.3.5 Mortuary Practices
Research into mortuary practices is potentially informative about developments in social
organization, and ritual and belief systems. During the Caddoan Period, the distribution and
complexity of community cemeteries is of special interest, including the use of shaft burials
within earthen mounds.
5.3.6 Trade and Exchange
As populations grew in size and complexity during this period, exchange networks broadened.
Exotic goods were introduced through long distance trade and local style became a recognizable
variable in the production of material goods. Examination of the temporal and spatial
distributions of these markers will assist the understanding of both intra-regional and interregional exchange networks.
5.3.7 Technology and Changes in Material Culture
This theme overlaps to some extent with similar ideas under the previous Emergence of
Sedentism context. Additional research is warranted into the emergence and spread of new
technologies including the bow and arrow, various agricultural implements, and pottery. These
developments occurred parallel with changes in architecture and building materials and as a
more diverse set of raw materials became available through the wider exchange networks.

5.4 THE EFFECTS OF EUROPEAN CONTACTS
Contact with Europeans left unprecedented and indelible changes on the peoples of Northeast
Texas. Examination of these changes focuses on the Protohistoric Period from A.D. 1540 to
1680 as well as the Historic Indian Period from about A.D. 1680 to 1860. These changes are
explored in depth by Perttula (1992), and the relevant research themes have also been
summarized by Perttula (1993b). Unique to this time period is the availability of archival and
ethnohistoric sources to supplement archeological data.
5.4.1 Demography and Public Health
As a direct result of contact with Europeans, population sizes in Northeast Texas plummeted due
to the introduction of new epidemic diseases. The catastrophic population declines in turn

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

triggered significant changes in politics and social organization. Forensic examinations of
skeletal assemblages are fundamental sources of important information about human populations
and public health.
5.4.2 Language and Ideology
Significant research into the related issues of language and ideology is uniquely possible during
the Historic Period. Archival documents record place names and tribal names and meticulous
archival and ethnohistoric research can identify and infer a measure of the impact Europeans
brought on language and on traditional belief systems. Changes in ceremonialism following the
catastrophic effects of new diseases can be traced through ceremonial architecture and the
introduction and spread of new exotic goods.
5.4.3 Status, Social Structure and Political Organization
As contact with Europeans precipitated decreases in population size, Caddo societies adapted by
evolving modified social hierarchies and complex social organizations. These changes can be
examined through the distribution and ubiquity of status markers, such as European trade goods,
symbology, and public architecture. Archival and ethnohistoric research can illuminate
migrations, alliances, and subjugation.
5.4.4 Subsistence and Economy
The introduction of new technologies, especially firearms and the horse, permitted and, to an
extent, forced significant changes in economic strategies. Archeological evidence for the
introduction and spread of these new technologies is vital, together with data informing on the
replacement of traditional cultigens and domesticates with introduced ones such as chickens and
cows. Other important research will investigate changes in food processing and food storage
strategies.
5.4.5 Technology
Contact with Europeans brought knowledge of new materials, new manufacturing techniques,
and whole new industries (such as animal husbandry). Firearms and the introduction of the horse
brought permanent changes to Caddoan societies. More research is needed into the spatial and
temporal distribution of introduced goods such as metal tools, implements and containers. The
historic time period affords an ideal opportunity to understand the general mechanisms and rates
by which various new artifact types are adopted into traditional systems and replace earlier
technologies.
5.4.6 Trade and Exchange
With Europeans came exposure to much wider economic networks. New types of goods and
new raw materials were introduced while at the same time European markets created increased
demand for traditional goods such as salt and furs. The distribution through time and space of

Page 70

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

introduced artifact materials such as metal and glass are keys to understanding the effects that
European contacts had on traditional trade networks.
5.4.7 Acculturation
During the Historic Period, acculturating the native peoples was an explicit objective of the
Europeans. The formal relationships between the French and then the Spanish and the Caddo are
a key research objective. Overlapping greatly with the closely related themes of ideology,
economy, status, technology, and trade, more archeological research is needed of the villages
that were associated with missions and European settlements.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 INVENTORY SUMMARY
This cultural resources inventory investigated seven separate locations in three counties of east
Texas. Three parcels were at Lake Wright Patman in Bowie County, and four parcels were at
Lake O’ the Pines in Upshur and Marion Counties. The sample consisted of 1,414 acres and the
parcels ranged in size from 56 to 420 acres. Field methods included a pedestrian inventory
accompanied by excavation of 984 shovel tests. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in
diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or to 80 cm below the surface. Overall testing
density for the project was 0.70 tests per acre (or, 1.4 acres per test).
The inventory documented 23 archeological sites including eight previously known sites and
fifteen newly discovered sites. No intact historic building or structure (greater than 50 years old)
was present in any of the inventory areas. Density of sites ranged from a low at Big Creek (Lake
Wright Patman) of one site per 322 acres to a high at Longview Intake (Lake O’ the Pines) of
one site per 12 acres (Table 6.1)
Of the 984 shovel tests dug within all inventory areas, 68 were positive for an overall yield of
6.9% (Table 6-1). Sixty-three of these positive tests were on the 23 sites and five were isolated
tests not clearly associated with any site. The remaining 916 shovel tests were negative,
including 157 negative tests that were excavated on sites and 759 negative tests that were dug on
transects.

6.2 SITE SUMMARY AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Using the limited shovel testing inventory tactics, a clear site evaluation could not be reached for
13 of the 23 sites (Table 6-2). At present, it is unknown whether or not these 13 sites may be
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP, and they should be protected from adverse impacts. If they
cannot be protected, these sites should be further investigated to clearly determine NRHP
eligibility. The remaining ten sites are considered not eligible for the NRHP and no further work

• 41BW22 is a prehistoric site of undetermined age that contains a small amount of nondiagnostic lithic debitage between 0-20 cmbs. Cultural resources were not observed on the
surface during the pedestrian survey. Based on the overall lack of features, diagnostics, and
low artifact yield, the site appears to offer little or no potential to answer significant questions
regarding regional or local archeology. As a result, site 41BW22 is assessed as a nonsignificant site that is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. No further research is
recommended.
• 41BW53. Nineteen shovel tests were excavated on 41BW53, and 83 artifacts were recovered
between 0-40 cmbs in eleven of the nineteen shovel tests. The presence of one Colbert point
(0-20 cmbs, ST9) and a Crockett Curvilinear incised ceramic sherd (20-40 cmbs, ST5)
suggest the site has an upper Early to Late Caddoan cultural component (0-20 cmbs) overlying
an older Woodland to Formative Caddoan component between 20-40 cmbs (Perttula 2004:378;
Turner Hester 1993:209). All the FCR recorded on the site (11 specimens) were within the
upper Early to Late Caddoan cultural component. This could indicate the presence of buried
burned rock hearths or oven features within the site. One unidentified bone fragment was
recorded within the lower Woodland to Formative Caddoan cultural component. The presence
of bone at this depth could indicate the subsurface geology of 41BW53 is conducive to the
preservation of biotic materials; additional intact biotic remains may be buried within the site.
The recovery of additional bone within the site could provide clues relating the floral/faunal
resources being consumed along with the seasonality of exploitation. The large site size and
moderate amount of FCR and ceramic artifacts recovered during shovel test excavations
suggest that the site was a large campsite or possible village located on a prominent terrace
overlooking the Sulphur River drainage to the south. The site could potentially provide data
that can help answer research themes such as prehistoric human subsistence and adaptation
that specifically relate to the Caddo that settled along the Sulphur River drainage from the later
stages of the Woodland to Late Caddoan time periods. However, additional testing is
necessary to determine if intact buried deposits are present.
• 41BW62. Six shovel tests were excavated on previously recorded site 41BW62 in order to
assess cultural resource deposition and site size. Cultural resources were not observed on the
surface or below the surface in any of the shovel tests. However, most of the site appears to
exist where shovel testing was not done, outside of the current project boundaries.
Accordingly, the site should be regarded as of unknown NRHP eligibility until such time as
additional testing can be conducted.
• 41BW69. Ten shovel tests were excavated within the confines of previously recorded site
41BW69. Cultural resources were not observed on the surface or in any of the shovel tests.
However, current lake levels are approximately 4 ft. higher than when the site was recorded in
1970, and the recorded previously cultural resources may be currently underwater. If present,
these materials may possibly be contained in intact buried deposits. Until such time as these
deposits can be tested, the site should be regarded as being of unknown NRHP eligibility.
• 41BW706 is a small surface scattering of early to mid twentieth century material within the
secondary disturbed context of an arroyo. Two shovel tests were excavated but yielded no
cultural material and exposed sterile clay at shallow depths (10-30 cmbs). A total of eleven

Ecological Communications Corporation

artifacts were recorded on the surface of the site while conducting the inventory. The artifacts
date to a time period that corresponds to the earliest possible manufacture date attained from a
wine bottle on the site (ca. 1936+). Aerial photographs taken between 1960 and 1970 show
the landscape of the site area as heavily impacted by timber planting. In all likelihood, the
artifacts were pushed into the arroyo during this time period and thus, are within a secondary
disturbed context. Based on the overall low integrity of the site and lack of features, further
investigations within the site will not produce significant data. Accordingly, the site is
considered as not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP and no further archeological work is
warranted.
• 41BW707 is a scatter of early to mid-twentieth century artifacts. A surface inventory was
conducted and five shovel tests were excavated in order to assess the nature of cultural
resource deposition and site size. Shovel tests yielded no cultural material and exposed sterile
clay at depths ranging from 30 to 60 cmbs. A total of 56 artifacts were recorded on the surface
of the site. The manufacture dates acquired from three bottles on the site (BALL mason jar,
laxative syrup bottle, machine oil bottle) suggest a date range between 1933 to 1943. The two
corrugated iron sheets and numerous household related artifacts on the surface possibly
indicate the site was occupied and had some sort of structure. However, the lack of clearly
discernable structural features (e.g., foundation, chimney, etc.) suggests the possible structure
may have been of a temporary construction (e.g., a squatters shack). The lack of structures on
ca. 1949 aerial imagery suggests the possible structure was demolished sometime between
1943 and 1949 . On the basis of the lack of structural evidence and lack of subsurface artifacts,
EComm recommends 41BW707 as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No further work
is warranted.
• 41BW708 contains a surface scattering of historic artifacts within a disturbed secondary
context that is also being impacted by erosion. An artifact inventory was conducted and five
shovel tests were excavated. Shovel tests yielded no cultural material and exposed sterile clay
at shallow depths ranging from 20 to 30 cmbs. Ten artifacts were recorded on the surface of
the site. Date of manufacture from two glass bottles (Anchor-Hocking and 3-Rivers) suggest
the material on the site was deposited sometime after 1937. The shallow depth of clay and the
artifacts location on the talus slope of a terrace strongly suggests the material is within a
secondary “push pile” surface context which is being impacted by colluvial (down slope)
erosion. Structural features were not apparent in the areas surrounding the site during the
pedestrian survey or on aerial imagery taken between 1949-1995. Based on the sites overall
low integrity and lack of features, further investigations within the site will not produce
significant data and the site is considered as not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. No further
archeological work is warranted.
• 41BW709. According to a local informant, 41BW709 contains a razed homestead that was
occupied and constructed by a local resident named Charlie Rogers in 1905 and which was
demolished in 1972 . One brick lined patio feature (Feature 1) was encountered in the western
portion of the site . All the bricks within the feature were produced by the Atlanta Brick
Company sometime between 1915 and 1940. Seven shovel tests were excavated but yielded
no cultural material and exposed sterile clay at depths ranging from 20 to 40 cmbs. A total of
25 artifacts were recorded on the surface. Besides the bricks recorded in Feature 1, the only

Page 76

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,414 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

other diagnostic artifact was a glass bottle that was manufactured sometime after 1929. On the
basis of the absence of subsurface artifacts and the lack of features other than the brick patio, it
is unlikely that further field investigation of this site would yield significant information about
early 20th century occupations of the area. As a result, the site is assessed as not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
• 41BW710 contains the razed remnants of an early to mid twentieth century homestead which,
according to a nearby neighbor, was possibly occupied by the children of Pink Rogers who
settled the region during the late nineteenth century. Nine shovel tests were excavated, and 72
artifacts were recovered between 0-40 cmbs in seven of the nine shovel tests. The toppled
remains of a brick chimney (Feature 1) were encountered in the central portion of the site. The
chimney was comprised of locally produced bricks that featured no makers mark stamp or
label. The presence of modern bottle glass below a 1900 era widow glass fragment in one of
the shovel tests suggests the site was heavily impacted when it was demolished. The absence
of discernable structures within the site area on aerial photographs taken between 1949-1995
suggest the structure dates to sometime prior to 1949. On the basis of the severely disturbed
context, the site is assessed as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is
warranted.
• 41BW711 is a prehistoric site of undetermined age that contained a small amount of nondiagnostic lithic debitage between 60-80 cmbs. Cultural resources were not observed on the
surface. Based on the overall lack of features, diagnostics, and low artifact yield, it is unlikely
that the site contains any potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local
archeology. As a result, site 41BW711 is evaluated as not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP
and no further work is warranted.
• 41BW712 appears to be a small prehistoric lithic workshop/quarry in which artifacts were
probably deposited during various stages of manufacture. A total of twelve shovel tests were
excavated, and 20 artifacts were recorded between 0-40 cmbs in five of the twelve shovel tests.
All of the artifacts were recovered within the context of an upland Bowie Gravel formation
which has been previously documented along the headwaters of Elliot Creek (Peter and Cliff
1990a). Given the large quantity of gravels and close proximity of three probable village sites
(41BW21, 41BW50, 41BW53) within one mile of the project area, the site may have
functioned as a lithic quarry/workshop. Based on the limited data collected on the site, the
NRHP eligibility status of 41BW710 is considered unknown and the site be avoided. If
avoidance is not possible, then further investigations would be necessary in order to clearly
determine the sites NRHP eligibility.
• 41MR4 is a previously recorded prehistoric campsite. A total of 16 shovel tests were
excavated and four lithic flakes and one non-diagnostic ceramic sherd were recovered between
0-70 cmbs in four of the 16 shovel tests. No artifacts were observed on the surface. The
eastern portion of 41MR4 that extends into the project area contains a low density 0-70 cm
deposit of cultural material within an intact soil matrix. Based on the limited data collected on
the site, the NRHP eligibility of the site should be considered unknown and the site should be
avoided. If avoidance is not possible, then further investigations would be necessary in order
to determine the sites NRHP eligibility status.

• 41MR114 is a previously recorded prehistoric campsite. Since 1997, erosion from waves and
down slope erosion along the bluff has removed a large portion of the terrace that was
recorded by Moore in 1997 thus, completely impacting intact portions of 41MR114 located on
the former terrace and covering it with lake water. However, a small area of what was the
extreme southern portion of the site in 1997 is located along an exposed beach. In this portion
of the site all the artifacts were observed deflated on the surface in a secondary disturbed
context. Within this area, 19 ceramic sherds were recorded and collected in order to date the
site. The ceramics collected on the site generally correspond with Moore’s initial assessment
of an occupation that dates from the Middle to Late Caddoan (1200-1500 AD) (see Appendix
C). Five shovel tests were excavated south of the site along an elevated terrace where wave
erosion had not impacted the integrity of soils. None of these five tests contain any cultural
material. An inspection of the terrace cut-bank found no cultural material eroding from the
exposed southern profile. Based on the fact that 41MR114 has been 100% impacted by
intensive erosion, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding
regional or local archeology. As a result, site 41MR144 is assessed as not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP. No further work is warranted.
• 41MR180 is a previously recorded low density prehistoric site. Cultural resources were not
observed on the surface. Fifteen shovel tests were excavated, but no artifacts were present and
Pleistocene clays were encountered at depths ranging between 20-60 cmbs. It is unlikely that
further investigations of the site would yield significant data and the site is recommended as
not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. No further archeological work is warranted.
• 41MR227 is a previously recorded low density prehistoric site. Artifacts were not observed
on the surface. Eight shovel tests were excavated and a total of three lithic flakes were
recovered in two separate and intact components between 0-20 and 60-80 cmbs. Site
41MR227 is a multi-component prehistoric site of undetermined age that contained a small
amount of artifacts within two intact components. Based on the limited data collected on the
site, the NRHP eligibility status of 41MR227 should be considered to be unknown and the site
be avoided. If avoidance is not possible, then further investigations would be necessary in
order to determine the extent of cultural resource deposition and the NRHP eligibility status of
the site.
• 41MR263 is a prehistoric campsite of undetermined age that contained a moderate amount of
artifacts within an intact soil matrix. Artifacts were not seen on the surface. Eight shovel tests
were excavated and 13 lithic and one FCR were recovered in an intact component between 060 cmbs. The FCR collected could indicate the presence of buried burned rock hearths or
oven features within the site. Based on the limited data collected on the site, the NRHP
eligibility status of 41MR263 should be considered unknown and the site should be avoided.
If avoidance is deemed impractical, further investigations would be necessary in order to
determine the extent of cultural resource deposition and the sites NRHP eligibility status.
• 41MR264. Fifteen shovel tests were excavated and 13 non-diagnostic ceramics (including one
pipe stem fragment), one FCR, and six lithic flakes were recovered between 0-70 cmbs within
an intact soil matrix. Artifacts were not observed on the surface. The moderate amount of
ceramics and presence of FCR indicate the site was a campsite of undetermined age

Page 78

overlooking the Big Cypress Creek drainage to the north. The FCR collected could indicate the
presence of buried burned rock hearths or oven features within the site. Based on the limited
data collected on the site, the NRHP eligibility status of 41MR264 should be considered to be
unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is not possible, then further
investigations may be necessary in order to determine the extent of cultural resource
deposition and the sites NRHP eligibility status.
• 41MR265. a total of nine shovel tests were excavated and four lithic flakes were recovered
between 0-20 cmbs in three of the tests. Heavy erosion within the site has removed an
undetermined amount of topsoil and exposed sterile Pleistocene clays at depths ranging
between 20-40 cmbs. Artifacts were not observed on the surface. Based on the overall lack of
features, diagnostics, low artifact yield, and low site integrity, this site offers little or no
potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local archeology. As a result, it
is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
• 41MR266. a total of ten shovel tests were excavated and two non-diagnostic and grogtempered ceramic sherds were recovered between 20-60 cmbs in two of the ten tests. The soil
pedon encountered consisted of intact deep alluvial floodplain deposits that featured distinct
horizons with abrupt lower boundaries. Due to heavy water saturation, maximum attained
shovel test depths ranged from 50-80 cmbs. No artifacts were not observed on the surface.
The site is located in an area where flooding has deposited deep multi-horizon deposits of fine
grained alluvium. Based on this setting, there is a high likelihood of encountering additional
buried cultural resources within the site. Based on the limited data collected on the site, the
NRHP eligibility status of 41MR266 should be considered as unknown and the site should be
avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to
clearly determine the sites NRHP eligibility status.
• 41UR310 is a newly recorded prehistoric site that contains a single intact Late Caddoan
cultural component. Eleven shovel tests were excavated and seven ceramic sherds were
recovered in intact soils between 0-40 cmbs. The presence of a Ripley Engraved ceramic
sherd suggests the site was occupied during the Late Caddoan period. Based on the limited
data collected on the site, the NRHP eligibility status of 41UR310 is uncertain and the site
should be avoided. If avoidance is not possible, then further investigations may be necessary
to clearly determine the extent of cultural deposits and the NRHP eligibility of the site.
• 41UR311 is a newly recorded multi-component prehistoric site of undetermined age that
contains a small amount of artifacts within three intact components. Ten shovel tests were
excavated and recovered four lithic flakes in three separate components between 0-20, 40-60,
and 80-100 cmbs. No artifacts were observed on the surface. Based on the limited data
collected on the site, its NRHP eligibility status is considered unknown and the site should be
avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical then further investigations may be necessary to
determine the extent of cultural deposits and the sites NRHP eligibility.
• 41UR312 is a newly recorded prehistoric campsite of undetermined age that contains a low
density of artifacts in intact soils between 0-100 cmbs. Six shovel tests were excavated and six
lithic flakes were recovered. No artifacts were observed on the surface. Based on the limited

fourteen shovel tests were excavated and 20 lithic flakes, three FCR, and one
unidentified bone fragment were recovered in two intact components between 0-60 and 80-100
cmbs. No artifacts were observed on the surface. The moderate amount of lithic debitage and
FCR indicate the site was a campsite of undetermined age overlooking the Big Cypress Creek
drainage to the east. The FCR collected could indicate the presence of buried burned rock
hearths or oven features within the site. The presence of bone at this depth could indicate the
subsurface geology of 41UR313 is conducive to the preservation of biotic materials, thus there
is a possibility that additional intact biotic remains may be buried within the site. The future
recovery of additional bone could provide clues to the floral/faunal resources being consumed,
along with the seasonality of exploitation. However, additional investigations are needed to
determine if this site contains intact features.

PREHISTORIC CERAMIC ANALYSIS
Victor Galan

C.1 INTRODUCTION
The ceramic analysis focused on describing sherd attributes, vessel manufacture, and decorative
techniques. The data collected from the sherds, along with comments about unique
characteristics, are presented in Table C-1. Interpretation was broad as the sample size was small
from each site. In addition, none of the collected artifacts were from large-scale block
excavations. A total of 53 artifacts were examined and described from six sites in the Lake O’
the Pines and Lake Wright Patman areas. Sites 41MR114 (n=19), 41MR264 (n=9), 41MR4 (n=1),
41UR310 (n=4), and 41MR266 (n=2) were near Lake O’ the Pines and site 41BW53 (n=18) was
near Lake Wright Patman. The ceramic description and analysis found the decorations and
temper suggest most of the sherds came from Caddo and utilitarian vessels with one exception: a
pipe bowl fragment was found at site 41MR264.

C.2 DEFINITIONS
Sherd attributes included collection data on vessel part, sherd size, and sherd thickness. Vessel
parts were recorded as base, rim, and body. Base sherds were identified by a flat and generally
thicker cross section from the underside of the vessel. Rim sherds included the lip of the vessel.
No rims were large enough to make an estimate of vessel size. Body sherds comprise the surface
of the vessel between the rim and base sherds. Sherd size was determined by placing the sherd
in the center of a scale of concentric rings with a 5 millimeter separation. Size was determined
as the ring closest to the edge of the sherd. Thickness was measured in millimeters (mm) with
calipers as the maximum perpendicular distance between the interior and exterior surfaces of the
sherd by pinching the thickest portion of the sherd between parallel edges of the calipers.
Vessel manufacture description included examining temper and firing techniques. For this
analysis, temper was bone, shell, or grog. Temper was observed using a reflective light
microscope set at 25 x magnifications. Bone temper was identified by several white angular
inclusions in the vessel paste. Shell temper was identified by several white linear and some
times flakey inclusions in the vessel paste. Grog was identified by several fine angular
inclusions of fired clay in the vessel paste. Firing was described using Teltser’s (1993:530-543)
article with a chart of oxidization patterns in sherd cross-sections.
Decoration techniques described included decoration type, location, and surface treatment.
Decoration type included incised, engraved, punctated, brushed, as well as plain categories for
this analysis. Some decorative elements were distinctive enough to relate to a specific vessel
type. Without decorative elements only decorative and manufacture data was obtained. As

stated in Suhm and Jelks (1962:19), several varieties of vessels were only decorated around the
rim leaving a large portion of the vessel undecorated. Decoration location was on the exterior of
the sherd (convex side) only for this analysis and surface treatments were recorded as smooth
with surfaces being created while the vessel was wet.

C.3 SAMPLE DESCRIPTIONS
C.3.1 Lake O’ the Pines
Site 41MR114
Site 41MR114 ceramic sherd sample included 19 specimens including two rims, two body/base
junctions, and 15 body fragments. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of 11 (58%)
sherds which included two brushed, one punctated, one punctated incised, and seven incised
sherds. Unfortunately, all of the decorated sherds were relatively small. No clear association
were made between the collection and any existing types. Incised and punctated decorations
included parallel lines and punctuations. Surface treatment was smoothed on all sherds except
four which had eroded surfaces. Temper inspection found 12 (63%) exclusively grog, one
bone/grog, three exclusively bone, and three shell temper sherds. Thickness range from 5 mm to
9 mm with no obvious correlations to decoration, temper, or firing. Firing reduction was
predominant on 13 (68%) of the sherds followed by five (26%) sherds with mixed oxidization
and reduction, and only one sherd completely oxidized. Moore (1998) documented site
41MR114 as a Middle to Late Caddo occupation. The current collected artifacts corresponded
with Moore’s initial assessment.
Site 41MR264
A total of nine ceramic sherds were found; eight
were analyzed and one was a sherdlet. Seven of
the eight analyzed sherds were body sherds with
grog temper. The eighth sherd was part of a pipe
bowl with grog temper. All but three sherds were
plain. Decorated sherds included one brushed
and one incised. The vessel sherds were between
5 and 8 mm thick. Of the eight sherds analyzed,
five (62%) had mixed oxidized and reduced
cores.
The remaining three sherds were
completely reduced.
The pipe bowl fragment included a small portion
of the elbow between the bowl and the stem. The
fragment had one horizontal line near the base
with several vertical lines extending upwards
from the horizontal line (Figure C-1). No
association could be made with existing ceramic

41MR264.

types; however, other pipes and fragments found in the region are most commonly associated
with the Red River type initially described by Hoffman (1967). The two reports referenced for
this analysis are Stokes and Woodring (1981:144) description of the assemblage found at the
George C. Davis Site and Bruseth and Perttula’s (1981:91) description of the assemblage from
six sites in the Lake Fork Reservoir. Both use Hoffman’s classification but none of the figures in
the reports were comparable to the small segment of the elbow found in during the survey.
Given the total sherd count and lack of decoration, no correlations or patterns could be
determined beyond describing these sherds as Caddoan utility wares and one small pipe bowl
fragment.
Sites 41MR4, 41UR310, and 41MR266
A total of seven ceramic sherds were found on
these three sites; site 41MR4 had one sherdlet,
site 41UR310 had four sherds; and site 41MR266
had two sherds. All of the sheds had grog
temper, smoothed surfaces, and had thicknesses
between 4 and 8 mm thick. One sherd on site
41UR310 was an engraved rim sherd; the
remaining six were body sherds.
Other
decorations included one brushed sherd from site
41MR266, two brushed sherds from site 41UR310,
and one punctuated sherd from site 41UR310.
The engraved sherd is most similar to Ripley
Engraved (Suhm and Jelks 1962:127) with a
whole excised triangle along a border line and a
diamond in diamond pattern (Figure C-2).
C.3.2 Lake Wright Patman

Figure C-2. Ripley Engraved sherd from
41UR310.

41BW53
Site 41BW53 ceramic sherd sample included 18 specimen included nine body sherds, one rim
sherd, and eight sherdlets that were not analyzed. Decorated sherds included one grog tempered,
incised body sherd with three circles 3 mm in diameter each on one side of a straight line. This
sherds was most similar to the Crockett Curvilinear Incised (850-1300 AD) example E on Plate
16 or examples H and I on Plate 17 in Shum and Jelks (1962). The rim sherd had a collared
standing flat rim (Figure C-3). Of the ten sherds analyzed, all but three had smoothed surfaces
and grog temper; the three remaining sherds had bone/grog, bone, and shell/grog tempers.
Thickness ranged from 5 to 8 mm with the thinnest sherd having the shell/grog temper. Firing
oxidization and reduction was mixed with almost equal numbers of sherd in varying degrees of
reduction. No accurate statement of cultural affiliation beyond Caddo period utilitarian ceramics
can be made with only one decorated sherd that most resembles an Early to Middle Caddo
occupation.

C.4 CONCLUSIONS
The analysis of the ceramic collections from
the six sites found evidence of Caddo ceramics.
In the Lake O’ the Pines area Site 41UR310’s
Ripley Engraved like sherd was suggestive of
an occupation between A.D. 1430-1680 (Suhm
and Jelks 1962:127). The analysis of the
ceramics from 41MR114 roughly correspond
with Moore’s assessment of the A.D. 12001500 time frame as well.
Neither sites
41MR264, 41MR4 or 41MR266 contained
diagnostic sherds although the near 100% use
of grog temper, well produced ceramics with
engraved, brushed, and punctate designs are
consistent with Caddo occupations in northeast
Texas. Site 41BW53 in the Lake Wright
Patman area contained a Crockett Curvilinear
Incised (A.D. 850 – 1300) like sherd. Overall,
the fact that the ceramic samples are so small
suggest either more excavations are required to
gather a representative sample.
