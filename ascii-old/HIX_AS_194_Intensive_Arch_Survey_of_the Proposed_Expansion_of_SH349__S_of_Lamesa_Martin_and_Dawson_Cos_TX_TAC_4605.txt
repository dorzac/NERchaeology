Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company conducted an intensive archeological survey along the
existing and proposed new right-of-way for the State Highway (SH) 349
improvements (CSJ# 0380-08-012, 0380-07-018) in Martin and Dawson
counties, Texas. The survey was conducted in compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas (13 TAC 26) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (36 CFR 800), under TAC Permit #4605. The project is considered a linear
survey; the total distance for the planned highway improvement is
approximately 42.5 miles, with a typical expansion of the existing ROW of 100 to
110 feet. The survey took place in both the existing TxDOT ROW and within the
proposed ROW on privately owned property. The total SH 349 project area
including both the existing and proposed ROW is 1306.59 acres. Archeologists
surveyed the entire existing ROW, plus all areas where right-of-entry (ROE) had
been granted. Archeologists secured ROE from 61% of the landowners, totaling
20.969 linear miles of survey area (275.51 Acres). The survey involved
pedestrian survey as well as the excavation of 160 shovel tests, of which only six
were positive for cultural materials. Due to limitations relating to lack of intact
deposits, no ROE and restrictions concerning mechanical excavation on private
lands spelled out in the ROE letters, backhoe trenching was not conducted. The
survey documented five new archeological sites within the proposed ROW. Sites
41DS13 and 41MT44 are both early to mid-twentieth century farmsteads or
trash dumps. Sites 41DS14, 41MT42, and 41MT43 are all prehistoric campsites
of unknown age. None of the five sites contained intact archeological deposits,
and none have potential for new data through additional investigation. As a
result, none of the five sites are recommended as eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Archeological Landmarks
(SALâs). Consequently, in all portions of the existing ROW and surveyed portions
of the proposed ROW within the SH 349 project area, Hicks & Company
recommends that no additional investigation is necessary for the project to
proceed to construction. In areas where no ROE was granted, attempts to assess
the possibility of cultural resources and to clear properties were effected through
reconnaissance level survey. Hicks & Company recommends survey for a limited
portion of these properties where surface visibility was low.
No artifact collections were made during the course of this project. All site forms,
photographs and project related records will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In July of 2007, Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an intensive linear
pedestrian archeological survey along the route of the proposed highway
improvement to State Highway (SH) 349 in Martin and Dawson counties in west
Texas (Figure 1). The proposed roadway expansion would extend approximately
42.5 miles from a point two miles north of the Midland and Martin County line
to a point 1.26 miles south of the intersection of SH 349 and FM 2052 south of
Lamesa, Texas. The project is intended to improve the existing roadway in order
to develop SH 349 to Texas Trunk System Standards. This project is sponsored
by TxDOT and the FHWA and the survey is conducted in compliance with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26).
The proposed improvements to SH 349 plan to expand the current two lane
roadway into a four lane divided highway through the addition of 100-110 feet of
additional right-of-way (ROW). The placement of proposed ROW expansion varies
throughout the project area, though it most often parallels the eastern edge of
the existing ROW in order to avoid a fiber optic line that runs on the western
edge of SH 349. However, other preexisting structures and utility or gas lines
necessitated that the improvements be located on the western side of the
existing ROW in several locations throughout the project area. In addition to the
expansion of the roadway, it is proposed to improve the interchange at the
junction of SH 349 and SH 176 through the construction of new access roads on
the northeastern side of the existing interchange. Originally, several alternatives
were proposed for a bypass through the town of Patricia, however, the final
design utilizes the existing ROW through the town. Based on available
schematics, the roadway will be built at grade or upon fill in most places within
the newly acquired right-of-way. The area of potential effects (APE) comprises
the entire footprint of the proposed roadway expansion in the existing and newly
acquired right-of-way (100-110 feet wide) and the areas of the proposed
interchange improvement. The vertical extent of the APE appears minimal with
typical impacts less than three and a half feet (1 meter) in depth. At the time the
field investigations were conducted, the total SH 349 roadway improvement
project area including the existing and proposed ROW consisted of 1306.59
acres. Of this, 541.61 acres was proposed new ROW.

Introduction and Management Summary

Funding for the archeological survey was provided through the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) with oversight from TxDOTâs Odessa
District and the Environmental Affairs Division who are overseeing the highway
construction.
The portion of SH 349 investigated in this survey crosses through a landscape
that is primarily utilized for agriculture, grazing and oil and gas extraction. Only
one town is present in the project area, Patricia, a small community located in
southern Dawson County. The landscape is relatively flat rolling plains
punctuated by playas and a single draw, Mustang Draw. Though oil and gas
extraction occurs throughout the project area, there is a notable shift from
south to north in land use practices corresponding to geology and soils.
Generally speaking, properties south of the intersection of SH 349 and County
Road (CR) 2051 are used for rangeland. This land use closely matches soil
distributions in the project area. The lands utilized for grazing are generally
characterized by shallow Slaughter-Kimbrough association soils overlying
indurated caliche (Figure 2). In contrast, the portions of the project area roughly
north of CR 2051, including all of Dawson County, are characterized primarily
by intensive agricultural use and deep Amarillo association sandy loam soils
(Figure 3). Broadly speaking, the construction of the existing SH 349 highway
and agricultural production have resulted in significant disturbance to the
natural deposits in the northern parts of the project area in Dawson County and
northern Martin County. In the southern portions of the project area,
disturbance outside the current SH 349 roadway is more sporadic resulting from
oil and gas exploration and the associated pipeline infrastructure.

Introduction and Management Summary

Figure 3: Typical agricultural land in northern portions of project area, looking
south along SH 349 (Dawson County)

The project took place within the existing ROW and on private land where rightÂ­
of-entry (ROE) has been acquired. At the time that the survey was conducted,
approximately 61% of the landowners had granted ROE for the archeological
survey. However, many of those who had not granted permission were some of
the larger landholders in the project area and thus only approximately 51% of
the proposed ROW in the project area was able to be surveyed. Where survey
was impossible, the edge of the proposed ROW was inspected from the current
ROW and assessed for the presence of cultural materials.
Accordingly, Hicks & Company archeologists focused their efforts on the
portions of the proposed ROW where right-of-entry had been granted and along
the existing TxDOT ROW. The areas of the proposed ROW were surveyed
following the methodology stated in the TAC Permit Application (Appendix 1).
Surveyors walked the proposed ROW in two or three parallel transects and
shovel tested areas in which surface visibility was less than 30% as per the
THCâs minimum standards for archeological survey. Throughout the project area
surface visibility varied considerably. In northern portions of the project area
where agricultural land use dominated, surface visibility was excellent to good
(100-60%) (Figure 4). In areas of rangeland or fallow fields, surface visibility
often fluctuated considerably, from low (0-30%) to very good (80-90%) (Figure
5). One hundred and forty-nine shovel tests were dug in the proposed ROW and
an additional 11 within the existing ROW for a total of 160 shovel tests.

Introduction and Management Summary

NEWLY-RECORDED SITES
During the course of the survey Hicks & Company archeologists recorded five
new archeological sites: 41DS13, 41DS14, 41MT42, 41MT43, and 41MT44.
These consisted of two historic twentieth century artifact scatters, 41DS13 and
41MT44, and three prehistoric sites of unknown age: 41DS14, 41MT42, and
41MT43. Site 41DS13 is a medium density scatter of historic glass, metal and
ceramic artifacts dating to the early to mid-twentieth century. The site is
disturbed by cultivation and there are no associated features. The site appears
to be a farmstead or an accumulation of dumped historic debris badly disturbed
by the plowing of the site. Site 41MT44 is also an early to mid-twentieth century
historic site with a scatter of metal, glass and ceramic artifacts. In addition,
several features including a concrete trough, metal poles and a possibly
intentional accumulation of rock were identified and mapped as part of this site.
Shovel testing showed no intact subsurface components, and the site appears to
be a demolished field house or homestead associated with ranching, farming or
oil drilling activities occurring on the property. Site 41DS14 is a prehistoric
campsite of unknown age situated on a low hill with views of four surrounding
playas. Though two artifacts were found within the upper 20 centimeters of the
site deposits, the site is primarily composed of a surface scatter of burned
caliche, lithic debitage, and non-diagnostic lithic tools. This site is heavily
disturbed by plowing. Site 41MT42 is another surface scatter of burned caliche
and lithic debitage of unknown age located on a low rise near a playa in a
currently uncultivated property. No tools, diagnostic artifacts or intact features
were identified. Site 41MT43 is the final prehistoric site and consists of a medial
biface fragment and very low density scatter of burned caliche and a piece of
chert debitage. Again, no intact features or temporally diagnostic artifacts were
recovered and the site appears to be the remains of a small campsite of
unknown age that has been seriously disturbed by plowing. None of the five
sites investigated exhibited evidence for the presence of buried or intact
subsurface features or contexts. As a result of the low site integrity and lack of
potential for additional information to be gathered through additional
investigations, none of the identified sites are being recommended for additional
testing and none of the sites are eligible for registration on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) or nomination as State Archeological Landmarks
(SALâs)

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
Bradford M. Jones was the Principal Investigator for this project. The field crew
consisted of Bradford M. Jones and Matthew Stotts, who were both present
throughout the full period of fieldwork from July 17th to July 26th, 2007, and
Rachel Feit who assisted with fieldwork for the first six days of the project. All
field crew members are Hicks & Company staff archeologists. All work has been
conducted under the terms and conditions of the First Amended Programmatic
Agreement (2005) among the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), TxDOT,
the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (TSHPO), the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (ACHP) and the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
between TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The survey
occurred on both state owned land (SH 349 ROW) and private property where
right-of-entry had been granted. The field survey was conducted under a nocollection policy and all artifacts discovered in the field were photographed and
described. Thus no artifacts were collected or will be curated, however, all
project notes, forms, drawings and photographs will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory. This report is offered in partial fulfillment of
TAC Permit # 4605.

Environmental Background

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The project area lies at the southeastern edge of the Llano Estacado which forms
the southernmost extension of the American High Plains region. Local streams
and creeks drain to tributaries of the Colorado River. Major local surface water
features include Mustang Draw, as well as numerous playa lakes into which
most surface water drains. The hilltops between the playa lakes offer 360Â° views
of the surrounding landscape.
The Hobbs and Big Spring Geologic Atlas of Texas maps indicate that the
underlying geology of the project area is made up of a combination of primarily
Holocene and Pleistocene deposits (Tahoka (Qta), Alluvium (Qal), Pond (Qun),
Caliche (Qcc), Windblown sand (Qcs)) and a very limited area of the
Miocene/Pliocene age Ogallala Formation. The SCS County Soil Surveys for
Martin and Dawson counties mapped twenty-one different soils (Table 1) within
the project area (Stoner and Dixon 1974, Sanders 1960). The most common are
soils mapped in the Slaughter-Kimbrough association and the Amarillo
association. Amarillo association soils are deep, nearly level to gently sloping,
loamy soils with a fine sandy loam surface layer and lower layers of sandy clay
loam (Figure 6). These soils are commonly cultivated. These soils are the most
common soil type within the project area north of the intersection of SH 349 and
SH 176 in northern Martin County and all of Dawson County. SlaughterKimbrough association soils are shallow to very shallow, nearly level to gently
sloping, loamy soils with a loam upper layer and a clay loam lower layer
underlain by indurated caliche 7 to 12 inches below the surface (Figure 7).
These soils are commonly used for rangeland and are the dominant soil type
within the project area south of the intersection of SH 349 with SH 176 in
Martin County. Only in the vicinity of Mustang Draw are other major soil
associations traversed by the proposed SH 349 highway improvement. On either
side of Mustang Draw are found a narrow band of Potter-Mansker association
soils. These are very shallow to deep, nearly level to steep, loamy soils. The
Potter-Mansker association soils are in turn bounded on either side by MilesPatricia association soils. These soils are deep, nearly level to gently sloping,
sandy soils. Overall, soils within the project area range from 0-72 inches in
depth and may have the potential for buried deposits. However, the use of these
soils for agricultural purposes and the presence of urban landscapes within the
project area mean there is a high potential for surface disturbance within the
project area. In addition, preexisting utility lines, wells, homes and businesses
are present along the project area, increasing the likelihood for disturbance to
the soils and any buried deposits that may be present.

The project area lies within the High Plains vegetation area of Texas, near its
ecotonal margin with the Edwards Plateau, Rolling Plains, and Trans-Pecos
vegetational areas (Gould 1975). The High Plains of Texas represent the
southernmost extension of the American Great Plains and were originally
classified as semi-arid shortgrass, tallgrass, and mixed prairie dominated by
various gramas (Bouteloua spp.), bluestems (Andropogon and Schizachyrium
spp.), buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides), and dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.)
(Hatch et al. 1990, Correll and Johnston 1979).
With the increase in
agricultural practices, much of the original vegetation has been converted to
cropland and rangeland. Woody species including sand sagebrush (Artemisia
filifolia), prickly-pear (Opuntia spp.), yucca (Yucca spp.), and mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa) have invaded many sandy sites (Hatch et al. 1990) in this region.
Areas of dune sand are commonly wooded with shin oak (Quercus havardii).
Because of the project areaâs proximity to the margins of three other vegetational
areas, species representative of each of the vegetational areas would be expected
to occur.
Project area vegetation consists of brush-dominated rangeland, typical of the
mesquite shrub/grassland vegetation type as described by McMahan et al.
(1984). Specific vegetation within the project area includes various gramas
(Bouteloua spp.), aster (Aster sp.), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), pricklypear (Opuntia spp.), western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), American
basketflower (Centaurea americana), horse crippler (Echinocactus spp.), threeawns (Aristida spp.), vine-mesquite (Panicum obtusum), with a woody component
consisting of mesquite, acacias (Acacia spp.), yucca, and lotebush (Ziziphus
obtusifolia). The northern half of the project area is devoted almost entirely to
crops such as cotton, peanuts and corn.

Environmental Background

In terms of wildlife, the project area falls within the Kansan biotic province of
Texas, as described by Blair (1950), near its ecotonal margin with the Balconian
and Chihuahuan provinces. The Kansan province encompasses the Texas
panhandle region and portions of adjacent states. Typical terrestrial species
include Western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Couchâs spadefoot
toad (Scaphiopus couchii), Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata emoryi), coyote
(Canis latrans), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), and black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus).
Wildlife species observed during field investigations were noted. Common avian
species noted during field visits include American Crow (Corvus brachyrhyncos),
Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), and
Scottâs Oriole (Icterus parisorum). Terrestrial species observed include coyote,
black-tailed jackrabbit, desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), Mexican ground
squirrel (Spermophilus mexicanus), Western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus
atrox), ground snake (Sonora semiannulata), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma
cornutum), tarantulas, and black widow spiders. Species noted around the
playas, which were full of water at the time of survey, included spotted
salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) and seagulls.
The climate ranges from an average 28Â° F in the January to an average 94Â° in
July. The region is arid, receiving approximately 16 inches of rainfall a year.
The growing season lasts for approximately 212 days annually (Gelin and Odintz
2001). At the time of the survey, the region had experienced an unusual amount
of rainfall and below average temperatures.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
Martin and Dawson counties are located in western Texas on the southeastern
edge of Southern Plains, also known as the Llano Estacado. Archeologically this
region has a documented history of human occupation spanning the Paleoindian
period through the current day, over 11,500 years of time (Johnson & Holliday
2004: 283). The commonly employed cultural chronology for the region has five
basic periods: the Paleoindian Period (ca 11,500-8550 BP), the Archaic Period
(ca 8,500-2000 BP), the Ceramic Period (2,000-500 BP), the Protohistoric Period
(500-300 BP), and the Historic Period (300 BP â present) (Johnson & Holliday
2004: 284).
Paleoindian Period (ca 11,500-8,550 BP)
The Paleoindian Period is the earliest period of known human habitation in the
Southern Plains, and has been subdivided based on distinct projectile point
types with consistent radiocarbon dates into Clovis, Folsom, and Late
Paleoindian periods (Johnson and Holliday 2004: 285-289). Sites and artifacts
dating to the Paleoindian period are most numerous in upland contexts, though
still rare, and are generally not found in situ. Exceptions to this general pattern
tend to be sites located on upland playas where there is sufficient sedimentation
to preserve sites. The most archeologically significant sites, however, have been
located in the draws that developed during the Pleistocene and where streams
continued to flow until about 9,500 BP. Generally speaking, Paleoindian groups
in the region are characterized as hunter-gathers who had an orientation
towards a broad-spectrum hunting base in the Clovis Period, which gradually
narrowed with an increasing emphasis on bison as the primary focus as the
region underwent a long term process of increasing seasonality, warming and
increasing aridity.
Archaic Period (ca 8,500-2,000 BP)
The Archaic Period, commonly subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late Periods,
shows a continuation of a hunting and gathering lifeways in the Southern Plains
(Johnson and Holliday 2004: 290-292). In the Early and Middle Archaic Periods,
the environment has been reconstructed to suggest increasing aridity that peaks
in the Middle Archaic period. Early Archaic sites remain poorly documented, but
Middle Archaic sites are better represented by excavated stratified archeological
sites. Both Early and Middle Archaic period sites continue to be associated with
bison hunting and processing, but additionally large oven processing of
presumably vegetal materials has been documented with associated
groundstone implements. During this period several sites such as the
Blackwater Draw, Mustang Springs and Marks Beach have evidence of the
construction of wells by the Archaic peoples. By the Late Archaic the harsh
climate conditions of the Early and Middle Archaic ameliorated with increasingly
moist conditions. However, the Late Archaic is also associated with only
localized sedimentation resulting in few stratified archeological sites from this
period. Only the San Jon Site has been identified as a bison kill site. Other Late
Archaic period sites are interpreted as camping locales with evidence of lithic
manufacture, corner- and side-notched Late Archaic style dart points, and
burned caliche hearthstones.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

Ceramic Period (2,000-500 BP)
The succeeding Ceramic Period marks the shift to the adoption of the bow and
arrow and ceramics within the larger Southern Plains region (Johnson and
Holliday 2004: 292-293). Scallorn and Deadman points are common arrow
points recovered from sites during this period. Early ceramics are coarsetempered and cord marked. In many sites of this period both arrow points and
darts points are found in association. After 1,000 BP, sites are commonly
associated with âPuebloan trade pottery and Plains lithic tool typesâ(Johnson &
Holliday 2004: 293). Though termed the Ceramic Period, it should be noted that
many sites of this period do not have pottery. For example, excavations at the
Lubbock Lake site have found stratified radiocarbon dated features from this
period, but none have produced pottery.
Protohistoric Period (500-300 BP)
The Protohistoric Period is characterized by serially occupied camping and kill
sites, including bison kill sites (Johnson and Holliday 2004: 293). At Lubbock
Lake, this period was associated with the recovery of Garza Points and
associated hearths as well as the processing of large game. Though European
colonization of the Americas had begun at this point, it was not until later that
indigenous people in this region began to be increasingly impacted by European
expansion.
Historic Period (300 BP â present)
Finally, the Historic Period encompasses all of recent history since the arrival of
European trade goods and the modern horse (Johnson and Holliday 2004: 293).
In general, Historic Period sites associated with the indigenous population are
much like Ceramic and Protohistoric Period sites but with the notable inclusion
of horse and modern trade goods such as glass beads. Washita points were
commonly associated with sites of this period at Lubbock Lake.
Martin County was formed in 1876, but was first part of Mitchell County, then
Howard County before being organized into its present form in 1884 with
Mariensfield (now Stanton) as the county seat (Hunt & Leffler 2001). Known
Indian groups residing in Martin County included the Lipan Apache and later
the Comanche in the mid-1800âs. The first permanent European settlement in
what would become Martin County was established at Grelton in 1881 by John
Konz. Early settlement was promoted and sponsored by the Texas and Pacific
Railway. Early settlers were principally farmers and ranchers, with cattle
ranching becoming a major industry by the 1890âs. Population levels remained
low in the county until the 1900âs, after which point settlement began to
increase steadily, and farming, especially cotton farming, began to take a more
prominent place in the county economy. Agriculture continues to this day to be
the backbone of the local economy. Oil and gas exploration did, however,
commence in the 1920âs, though it was not until late 1940âs and 1950âs that it
began to play a significant part in the local economy.
Dawson County was also formed on August 21, 1876, but remained judicially
tied to Howard County until 1905 (Gelin and Odintz 2001). In the 1870âs the
region was home to both Comanche and Kiowa Indian groups. Reports from
surveyors of the Texas and Pacific Railway lands reported large numbers of
buffalo in the region in 1875, which attracted many hunters to the area. Though
portions of the county had been included in an 1827 land grant issued to Dr.

John Cameron by the Mexican government, there does not appear to have been
any European settlement of the area until the 1880âs, at which time most of the
county was part of four large cattle ranches. The first decades of the twentieth
century, however, saw a sudden rise in the local population as settlers began to
acquire lands and establish farms. Population continued to climb until the
1960âs, but has slowly declined since then. In 1905 Lamesa became the seat of
the county and in 1911 the Santa Fe railroad was constructed through Lamesa.
By 1914 or 1915 cotton had become the main crop and remains the most
important agricultural product in the county today. During the 1930âs oil and
gas extraction began, and this has also become an important component of the
local economy. Both agriculture and oil remain the basis of the countyâs
economy.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
According to records researched on the Texas Historical Commission Sites Atlas,
only one previously conducted survey overlaps the project area near the
southern terminus. This areal survey was conducted for the FAA, and is
bounded on its western edge by the current SH 349 ROW. No cultural resources
were identified in the course of that survey. Another areal survey was conducted
by the TNRCC approximately a kilometer northeast of the northern project
terminus. No sites were identified in the course of this survey.

PREVIOUSLY-RECORDED SITES
Prior to the conduct of this survey 41 sites had been recorded in Martin County
and only 12 in Dawson County. Sites encountered included all time periods from
the Paleoindian Period through the Historic Period. According to records
researched on the Texas Historical Commission Sites Atlas, no previously
recorded sites are present within the project area. Three sites â 41DS2, 41DS8,
and 41MT11 â are located within close proximity of the project area. Site 41DS8,
located just south of the TNRCC areal survey and approximately 3,083.99 feet
(940 meters) northeast of the northern project terminus, is the closest site. No
information concerning the site is available on THC Sites Atlas. Site 41DS2, the
White Site, is a Late Prehistoric (Ceramic or Protohistoric Period) bison kill site
and possible camp site located 7,808.4 feet (2,380 meters) east of the project
area at the edge of a playa. Recorded in a road cut in 1982, the site had
exposed bison bone, burned rock, and lithic tools including scrapers and a
Harrell and a Fresno point found in association. Additional bone was noted on
the surface in adjacent corn fields. No formal archeological investigations were
conducted at the time that it was recorded, but test excavations were
recommended to determine site potential. Finally, 41MT11 is approximately
7,874 feet (2,400 meters) west of the project area on the east side of McKenzie
Draw. The site was recorded by archeologists from the University of Texas and
consists of a surface scatter of burned rock and chert flakes that was seriously
disturbed as a result of plowing and natural erosion. Given the poor site
preservation, no further work was recommended for the site and it was
considered ineligible for NRHP/SAL listing.
Archeological research associated with the construction of the Sulpher Springs
Draw Reservoir (Quigg, et. al. 1994) and the Red Lake Reservoir (Quigg, et. al.
1993), both west of the project area, encountered multiple prehistoric and
historic archeological sites adjacent to draws and playas. Deposits were
generally limited to the surface, though several sites had deposits .33-.98 feet

(10-30 centimeters) in depth below surface. Only two sites exhibited greater
depth: 41MT41 had material present to a depth of 1.97 feet (60 centimeters)
below surface and 41MT21 had artifacts present to depths of over one meter.
Prehistoric artifacts consisted primarily of burned rock and caliche, lithic
debitage and occasional chipped or ground stone tools. Several sites also had
historic components. In all cases, regardless of depth of deposits, artifacts were
visible on the surface.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
During the course of the archeological survey along the proposed improvements
to SH 349 in Dawson and Martin counties, archeologists traversed
approximately 20.97 miles (275.51 acres) of the proposed ROW and the entire
existing TxDOT ROW corridor. Because right-of-entry was not granted to 20.71
miles (266.1 acres) of the proposed new ROW, archeologists only observed,
photographed and took notes on these areas from the edge of the existing
TxDOT ROW. In properties within the project area where ROE was granted, the
area of the proposed ROW was shovel tested at a rate of 16 shovel tests per
linear mile per 100 feet of width in areas with less than 30% surface visibility, in
accordance with the THCâs minimum standards for archeological survey. In
addition shovel testing was also conducted at the discretion of the surveyors in
locations where it was deemed that archeological sites were more likely to be
encountered, primarily in the vicinity of playas. Shovel tests were excavated to a
depth of one meter, to bedrock or to culturally sterile ancient soils, whichever
was encountered first. Soil from all shovel tests was screened through Â¼â
hardware mesh. Investigators recorded their observations and the results of
shovel tests through notes, standardized shovel test forms, and photographs.
Any archeological sites identified during the survey were investigated by means
of no fewer than six shovel tests in order to define site boundaries relative to the
project corridor. Artifacts encountered on the surface or in the course of
subsurface testing were not to be collected, but fully photo documented in the
field. Archeologists excavated a total of 160 shovel tests, with only six shovel
tests being positive for cultural materials. A total of five new sites â 41DS13,
41DS14, 41MT42, 41MT43, and 41MT44 â were identified during the course of
the survey. What follows is a discussion of the results of the field investigations
along the entire project area beginning with an overview of the existing ROW, a
comment on properties where no ROE was granted, and followed by a detailed
discussion of the proposed ROW. In order organize the discussion of the survey
of the proposed ROW, it is broken down into multiple segments along the entire
length of the project area and discusses both properties where ROE was granted
and those where it was not.

EXISTING RIGHT-OF-WAY
Survey within the existing TxDOT ROW along SH 349 indicated that throughout
the entire length of the project area significant disturbance was present. Clearly
visible in many places were drainage culverts generally placed along both sides
of the existing road (Figure 8). In other areas the use of fill to raise the surface
for the road was also notable, as were locations where existing landforms were
flattened. At times the construction of these culverts and the leveling of the road
bed resulted in the creation of significant spoil piles at the edge of the ROW
(Figure 9). In addition, drains were regularly placed running under the existing
road, resulting not only in disturbance due to their construction, but increased
erosional action as well (Figure 10). Other clearly visible forms of disturbance
included areas of gravels and caliche fill materials within the right-of-way
(Figure 11). The use of fill material to grade the existing roadbed was commonly
noted dispersed across the ground surface within and adjacent to the ROW. This
material was particularly notable on the surface of active agricultural fields
lining the ROW, where pieces of caliche and quartzite (the most common fill
materials noted by investigators) were often found scattered across the surface
up to 65.62 feet (20 meters) beyond the current ROW limits.

Other forms of disturbance within, or more commonly, on the edge of the
existing ROW, included the placement of utility lines and poles, gas lines, and
numerous driveways and farm road and county road intersections. In particular,
the many county and ranch roads that intersect SH 349 were areas where
disturbance was significant. In most cases the road was constructed by

bulldozing or leveling the ground, leaving the road as a cut through the surface
sediments (Figure 12). Other areas of the ROW had been disturbed due to heavy
vehicles driving on the ROW, some perhaps a result of farming activities in
adjacent fields (Figure 13).

Figure 13: View of ground surface in existing ROW disturbed by heavy vehicle

Shovel testing within the existing ROW was limited, amounting to only 11 shovel
tests, owing to the clear disturbance and often greater than 30% surface
visibility encountered. All shovel tests in the ROW were negative for cultural
materials. However, those shovel tests placed within the existing ROW clearly
reinforced the evidence for disturbance visible on the surface. Shovel tests
generally encountered heavily compacted sediment mixed with road fill and
modern trash in the upper 10-30 centimeters with a gradually decreasing
percentage of road fill with depth. In most of the project area fill was present to
approximately 30-70 centimeters below surface, though at times it was observed
to a depth of a meter. One striking example of the effects of the original SH 349
highway construction on the existing surface was recorded during shovel testing
in the ROW on the north side of Mustang Draw where it is crossed by the project
area. In shovel test RF#8, placed at the very western edge of the existing ROW,
the stratigraphy in the test was clearly divided between the eastern and western
halves. In the eastern half road fill was encountered mixed with sediment to the
bottom of the shovel test, and in the western half of the shovel test only
disturbed and partially intact sediment lacking road fill was observed.

NON RIGHT-OF-ENTRY AREAS
Though access was granted to approximately 275.51 acres of proposed ROW, a
significant portion of the proposed ROW (approximately 266.1 acres) was not
accessible at the time of the survey. Nonetheless, a concerted effort was made to
assess and clear the properties through observation from the edge of the current
ROW and by documenting any observed evidence for disturbance or cultural
materials visible on the surface. Generally speaking, lack of ROE presented a
larger problem in the project area in Martin County where large tracts of lands
owned by two major landholders, the Holts and the Mabee families, were
inaccessible. In contrast, in the northern portions of the project area in Dawson

and Martin counties, access was greater and the lack of ROE was partially
ameliorated by the patchy nature of the entry where small properties with no
ROE were interspersed with properties with ROE. Furthermore, in Dawson and
Martin County north of the intersection of SH 349 and CR 2052, much of the
land is being actively cultivated which enabled surveyors to get a much better
sense of what was on the surface as well as to assess the possibility for sites
being located there. In those areas where disturbance is clearly manifested, lack
of ROE was not relevant in assessing the need for portions of these properties to
be cleared without further survey, though in most cases disturbance was limited
in scope and did not de facto present justification for clearing entire unsurveyed
properties. Because of the large number of no ROE properties interspersed with
properties with ROE, individual properties with no ROE are discussed within the
proposed expanded ROW section in order to better situate them within the
context of the archeological survey.

PROPOSED EXPANDED RIGHT-OF-WAY
In all properties where Hicks & Company archeologists had ROE, the proposed
ROW was intensively surveyed on foot with shovel testing occurring in areas
where surface visibility was less than 30%. Overall, ground surface visibility
varied widely both within the project area and even within individual properties,
depending on both the use of the land and the types of soils present. For
example, areas with active cultivation had extremely good surface visibility â
between 90-100%. In areas with Amarillo association soils that were
uncultivated, visibility varied between 20-75%, though most areas had visibility
between 40% and 60%. These areas tended to be dominated by grass and
mesquite that grew relatively tall, but which tended to be spaced apart providing
good overall surface visibility. Areas of uncultivated rangeland with SlaughterKimbrough association soils, however, often exhibited much lower overall
surface visibility (15-60%) necessitating more regular shovel testing in the
southern portion of the project area where these soils are most common.
Because the survey was conducted over a large distance with patchy ROE, the
discussion of the results of the investigation in the proposed ROW is broken
down into a series of segments defined by the intersection of the SH 349 project
area with county roads (CR), ranch roads (RR), and state highways (SH). The
orientation is north to south. In general, the proposed ROW passes on the
eastern side of the current SH 349 ROW and the reader should understand that
unless otherwise stated, this is the case throughout the descriptions.
CR 29 to CR 23/CR 1( Plate 1)
The first segment of the survey extends from the northernmost portion of the
project area at County Road (CR) 29 and continues to the intersection of SH 349
with CR 23 and CR 1. The first property in this segment is owned by Charles L.
Anderson, who granted ROE. The property is currently being planted with cotton
and had excellent surface visibility (95-100%) with a light scatter of road base
present on the surface 32.81-65.62 feet (10-20 meters) east of the existing
TxDOT ROW (Figure 14). Though the excellent surface visibility did not
necessitate the placement of shovel tests on this property, a single shovel test
(BJ#1) was placed in this property in order to establish a baseline for
subsequent results. The resulting shovel test encountered an upper 50
centimeters of loose yellow-brown (10YR5/4) sandy loam which grows
increasingly compacted with depth. The upper 20 to 30 centimeters are part of
the current plow zone. At 50 centimeters below the surface there is a very

noticeable shift to a dense sandy yellow-red (5YR4/6) clay present to a meter
with gradually increasing compactness. In addition, shovel tests MS#1 and
RF#1 were intentionally placed in the existing ROW on opposite sides of SH 349
in order to examine the condition of deposits within the ROW. Both shovel tests
encountered a loose to compact upper 30 to 50 centimeters of red-brown sandy
loam with intermixed road base and modern artifacts. This was underlain by
compacted red-brown clay.
The next two properties are jointly owned by the Connie Smith Trustee, Rex W.
Nolan, and Iris Millender. No ROE was granted for these properties. The
properties are active agricultural fields with high ground surface visibility
(Figure 15). From the edge of the TxDOT ROW no artifacts or evidence for
archeological materials was noted. Two shovel tests placed in the adjacent ROW
(MS#2, RF#2) encountered road base and modern glass to depths of up to 60
centimeters below surface.
In the southern portion of the Connie Smith Trustee, et. al. property, the
proposed SH 349 ROW shifts to the west side of the road for a short distance
passing first through the Atchley Property for which no ROE was granted. The
portion of the property through which the proposed ROW passes is unused and
covered in short and tall grasses with little to no surface visibility. A single
shovel test in the TxDOT ROW (BJ#2) encountered disturbed and very
compacted sandy loam with small caliche nodules. Outside the TxDOT ROW
there is a notable artificial rise to the land surface suggesting it was formed
during the cutting of the road and culverts (Figure 16).
Still on the west side of SH 349, the final property before CR 23 was the Martha
Lou Neil property. Where this property is within the proposed ROW it forms a
small triangle bounded on the north by CR 1 and the south by CR 23, which
converge in an intersection with SH 349 (Figure 17). Right-of-entry had been
granted for this property. The field was covered in wildflowers and had low
surface visibility (20-40%). Two shovel tests (RF#3, RF#4) placed in this property
within the proposed ROW were negative for cultural materials.

CR 23/CR 1 to CR 24 (Plates 1-2)
The segment from CR 23 to CR 24 consists of properties where ROE was both
granted and was not. Immediately south of CR 23 the proposed SH 349 ROW
begins shifting back to the eastern side of the current roadway, passing through
a property belonging to Patsy Anne Shook which is bisected by SH 349 and for
which no ROE was granted. Currently the property is not being used for
agriculture and is overgrown with short and tall grasses. Surface visibility is
poor, making assessment from the TxDOT ROW difficult (Figure 18). A single
shovel test (BJ#3) placed at the edge of TxDOT ROW on the west side of SH 349
near the proposed ROW encountered modern materials in disturbed contexts to
a depth of 30 centimeters below the surface. Sterile sandy clay sediments were
encountered below.
The property of Donald Vogler, for which ROE was granted, was situated south
of the Shook property and extends to the intersection of CR24 and SH 349. The
property encompasses a low area and associated playa east of the proposed
ROW. This property is currently being used to cultivate corn and has excellent
surface visibility. Because of the proximity of the playa, a single negative shovel
test (BJ#4) was placed at the northern edge of the property near the top of the
rise. Subsequently, historic artifacts were observed scattered across the surface
of the proposed ROW on the upper part of the property situated on the north
side of the playa. This early twentieth century site was recorded as 41DS13 (see
Site Discussion section). In the lowest portion of the property west of the playa a
large drain running under the highway has resulted in increased erosion and
disturbance to the proposed ROW (Figure 10). No evidence of prehistoric or
historic occupation was registered on the portion of the property south of
41DS13.

CR 24 to CR H (Plate 2)
This very small segment passes through the Marvin Kid property. The proposed
ROW was surveyed owing to the ROE given. Surface visibility was good to
excellent and no shovel testing was conducted on the property. No artifacts of a
prehistoric or historic nature were observed. Notable was the presence of a large
artificial berm on the western side of SH 349 indicative of the types of
disturbance common to the ROW and immediately adjacent areas.
CH H to CR 25 (Plate 2)
The northern portion of this segment belongs jointly to the Connie Smith Trust,
Rex W. Nolan, and Iris Millender, and no ROE was provided. The land is
currently being utilized to grow crops and the portions within the proposed ROW
had excellent surface visibility (Figure 19). From the vantage point of the
adjacent TxDOT ROW modern trash and road base were observed scattered in
the fields near the current ROW, but no historic or prehistoric artifacts or sites
were observed.
The next property south of the Connie Smith Trust, et al. property is owned by
John Saleh. ROE had been granted and the proposed ROW was fully surveyed in
this property. The property is currently a cultivated field with excellent surface
visibility. This property is followed by the Dianne Murphy property, which is in
turn bounded on the south by CR 25. ROE was provided for Dianne Murphyâs
cultivated field, which had excellent surface visibility and was fully surveyed. No
prehistoric or historic artifacts or sites were observed on either property.

CR 25 to CR G (Plate 2)
This segment crosses two properties, both with ROE granted. The first is another
property owned by Donald Vogler and the second by Doris Jean Foster. Both
properties are being actively cultivated with excellent (95-100%) surface
visibility. Disturbance associated with the maintenance or construction of the
current fields was observed at the boundary juncture of the two properties. Just
east of the boundary between the Vogler and Foster properties a small playa is
present (Figure 20). Though ground surface was sufficient to assess the project
area within the two properties, three shovel tests (RF#9, MS#8, BJ#11) were
placed at approximately 328 foot (100 meter) intervals in order to test for
possibly buried deposits near the playa. No artifacts were observed on the
surface and all shovel tests were negative.

CR G to CR 26 (Plate 2)
This segment crosses an active agricultural field owned by the Oscar Paul Vogler
Estate. ROE had been granted and the entire proposed ROW was surveyed.
Surface visibility was excellent. At the south edge of the property where it abuts
CR 26, a scatter of burned caliche, chert and quartzite debitage, and nondiagnostic lithic tools was identified on the surface. This prehistoric site of
unknown age, 41DS14, was subsequently shovel tested and found to continue
as a surface deposit on the other side of the road (also an Oscar Paul Vogler
property). Further discussion of the site is provided in the Site Discussion
section.
CR 26 to CR F (Plate 3)
As noted above, the northernmost portion of this segment contains site 41DS14
in property owned by the Oscar Paul Vogler Estate. The remainder of the
segment was all agricultural fields, with the southern half owned by Henry F.

Vogler. ROE was granted for all property in this segment. Surface visibility was
excellent in both fields. South of the limits of 41DS14 no additional artifacts of a
prehistoric or historic character were encountered by the surveyors.
CR F to CR 27 (Plate 3)
This short segment crosses an active agricultural owned by Henry F. Vogler, who
granted permission to survey the property. Surface visibility continued to be
excellent owing to the plowing and cultivation of the field. No artifacts or sites
were registered in this property.
CR 27 to CR 28 (Plate 3)
This segment crosses three different private properties. The northernmost
property is owned by the Glynn I. & Wanda J. Snell Living Trust and was not
surveyed because ROE was not given. The property is currently utilized for
agriculture and is the site of a small playa (Figure 21). Observations of the
property made from the eastern edge of the TxDOT ROW indicated that surface
visibility was excellent. No artifacts or indications of historic or prehistoric sites
were noted.
The subsequent two properties were both fully surveyed as permission for
survey had been granted by the owners. The property south of the Snell Living
Trust field is owned by Roy Huffaker, and only a small portion of the northwest
corner of the property will be affected by the proposed ROW expansion. Ground
surface visibility was excellent given use of the property for agriculture. The
southernmost property in this segment, owned by James A. Martin, was not
being actively cultivated and was characterized by short and long grasses and
wildflowers which resulting in only good to low surface visibility (Figure 22).
Owing to this factor and the presence of a small playa to the west, four shovel
tests were dug (MS#10, RF#13, RF#14, BJ#14) to assess for the possibility of
archeological deposits. Deposits were characterized by 20-60 centimeters of
sandy reddish yellow (5YR6/6) followed by compact red (2YR4.5/8) sandy clay.
All shovel tests were negative for cultural materials.

CR 28 to RR 829 (Plate 3)
This short segment comprises the northwest corner of Calvin Fosterâs property.
ROE for this property was granted and the proposed ROW was surveyed.
Surface visibility was good (60-90%) and no cultural materials were noted within
the project area.
RR 829 to RR 828 (Plate 3-4)
The segment between RR 829 and RR 828 is a section in the proposed project
area where the proposed ROW narrows to match the existing TxDOT ROW as it
enters into town of Patricia. The segment crosses two properties. The
northernmost, for which no ROE was granted, is owned by Harris Heirs, Lois
Echols Life Estate and Gloria Echols Johnson. The southern property, for which
ROE was granted, is owned jointly by Abel Perez, Ackerly Oil Co., Inc, and the
M. M. Brown Childrenâs Trust. Both properties are active agricultural fields with
excellent (95-100%) surface visibility (Figure 23). Survey along the west edge of
the Echols property in the existing ROW did not result in the identification of
any cultural artifacts, nor did survey in the proposed ROW in the Perez, et al.
property.

Patricia (Plate 4)
According to the existing plans for the improvements to SH 349, as it passes
through the small town of Patricia, the highway will utilize the existing ROW.
Survey through the town indicated that the present ROW has the same types of
disturbance present throughout the project area: grading and the creation of
drainage culverts. In addition the residential and commercial development
along the road has contributed to the disturbance through the construction of
driveways and yards as well as the placement of utility infrastructure (Figures
24-26). Owing to the extensive disturbance in this portion of the project area,

and the fact that all sites in this area are confined to the surface, no shovel tests
were dug and the area was photo documented.

Patricia to CR D (Plate 4)
This segment extends from the southern edge of development associated with
Patricia and crosses two private properties. The northern property in the
proposed ROW, owned by the Jose Medina & Maria Gallo Trust, was fully
surveyed. At the time of the survey the property was not being actively cultivated
and was covered in short and tall grasses and wildflowers. Nonetheless, surface
visibility remained good (50-75%) and no shovel testing was deemed necessary.
No cultural artifacts were identified during the survey of this property. The
adjoining property to the south, owned by Carol Fry Ray, was actively cultivated
farmland with excellent surface visibility, though ROE was not granted for this
property. Survey along the existing TxDOT ROW did not indicate the presence of
any cultural materials on the surface of the property adjacent to the ROW.
CR D to CR 30 (Plate 4)
This segment of the survey crossed the property of Nora Espindola & Sam and
Syble Parham, who granted ROE to survey the proposed ROW. The property is
an active agricultural field with excellent (95-100%) surface visibility. During the
course of the survey a small scatter of approximately 5 burned pieces caliche
was found. This area measured less than 16.4 X 6.56 feet (5 X 2 meters).
Intensive surface inspection of the surrounding area failed to find other burned
caliche or other types of cultural artifacts. In addition, three shovel tests were
placed at 100 meter intervals in the field to investigate the possibility of buried
deposits. All shovel tests were negative and encountered an upper deposit of
loose brown (7.5YR4/4) sandy loam plow zone from 20 to 35 centimeters below
the surface overlaying compact dark brown (7.5YR3/3) sandy clay. Because of
the lack of other cultural material of definite prehistoric age as well as the small
size of the burned caliche scatter, the investigators did not believe that this
amounted to sufficient evidence to indicate that a site was present. No other

cultural artifacts or evidence for prehistoric or historic occupation of the site was
recorded in the course of surveying this property.
CR 30 to CR C (Plate 4)
Within this small segment for which ROE was granted by the owners Jerry
Mitchell and Sam and Syble Parham, a single piece of chert debitage was
encountered on the ground surface. The property is an active agricultural field
with excellent (95-100%) surface visibility. Subsequent to locating the flake,
intensive inspection of the ground surface in the field and in the existing TxDOT
ROW on both sides of SH 349 was conducted. No additional cultural artifacts
were found to be present on the surface. Additionally, three shovel tests (RF#15,
MS#11, BJ#15) were dug adjacent to the area in which the flake was found. All
shovel tests were negative for cultural materials. Based on the lack of additional
evidence, the flake was recorded as an isolated find (IF#1) and not registered as
a site.
CR C to CR 31 (Plate 4)
This segment was located entirely within an agricultural field owned by Nora
Phillips and ROE was given to survey the proposed ROW. The majority of the
property was active agricultural land with excellent surface visibility (95-100%).
No prehistoric or historic cultural materials were noted during the survey of the
property. At the southern end of the property where it abutted CR 31, an
artificial rise was noted and investigated (Figure 27). The rise is vegetated with
short and tall grasses and weeds and has large modern trash and debris at the
apex. The rise appears to have been constructed by pushing or possibly
dumping a large amount of soil and caliche here and clearly demonstrates
disturbance on this portion of the property.

In this segment the proposed SH 349 project area crosses into Martin County
just south of CR 31. No ROE was granted for either of the two properties within
this segment. The northern property is owned jointly by David Riker, Joan Riker
Haney, and Jayne Riker Olear, and the southern property by Alissa Paige,
Cawfield Howard, and Stephen Lee Cawfield. Both properties are being
cultivated and have excellent (95-100%) ground surface visibility (Figures 28,
29). As observed from the eastern edge of the existing TxDOT ROW, no
prehistoric or historic cultural artifacts were noted as present.

CR 5100 to CR 2651 (Plate 5)
Through this segment the proposed SH 349 ROW crosses four different
properties. Only the southernmost property owned by the Heddy Mitchel Myrtle
Estate granted ROE to survey the proposed ROW. The other three properties,
from north to south, were the G. I. Snell property, C. R. Hightower property, and
the J & K Farms property. Of these three no ROE properties, the G. I. Snell
property is actively being cultivated and provided excellent (95-100%) surface
visibility from the eastern edge of the existing TxDOT ROW (Figure 30). No
prehistoric or historic cultural materials were observed when investigating the
property from the existing ROW. The other two properties are both currently
uncultivated and covered in moderate to dense ground cover which limited
observation of the properties from the existing ROW, though no artifacts were
noted in the ROW or on what could be seen of the surface of the two properties
(Figure 31). Finally, the Myrtle Estate property was surveyed within the
proposed ROW. Given the good (60%) to very good (80%) surface visibility on the
property, no shovel tests were dug and no archeological artifacts were observed.

CR2651 to CR 4800 (Plates 5-6)
This segment crossed six separate properties for which all but the southern two
ROE had been granted. The northern property in the segment is owned by the
KNAB Corporation and is not currently being utilized. Ground surface visibility
was moderate to very good (40-80%) with short and tall grasses, mesquite and
cactus present. A small playa located on the east side of SH 349 is in the center
of the property. On the south and eastern sides of the playa there is a very
notable rise in the topography just outside the ROW. It is unclear if this rise is a
natural or artificial feature. At the southern end of the property at the top of a
rise on the southern side of the playa a low density scatter of burned caliche and
lithic debitage was recorded as 41MT42 (see Site Discussion section below). Six
shovel tests were dug in association with the recording of 41MT42.
South of the KNAB Property and 41MT42, the next property was an agricultural
field with excellent surface visibility owned by T. Shook. No cultural materials
were noted during the survey of this property. South of the Shook property
another KNAB Corp. property was surveyed. As with the first KNAB Corp.
property, this land was currently unused and overgrown with short and tall
grasses, mesquite, and cactus. In the northern end of the property the ground
surface visibility was less than 30% and two shovel tests (BJ#18, MS#14) placed
100 meters apart were dug. Sediments encountered in the shovel tests
consisted of loose dark yellow brown (10YR4/6) sandy clay which transitioned to
dark brown (7.5YR3/3) clay at 60-65 centimeters below the surface. Both
shovel tests were negative and no artifacts were observed on the surface of the
property. In the adjoining uncultivated property to the south, owned by J.P.
Vogler, survey in the proposed ROW encountered generally low surface visibility.
As a result four shovel tests (BJ#17, MS#13, RF#17, RF#18) were dug to
investigate for cultural resources. All shovel tests were negative for cultural
materials, encountering sterile dark yellow brown (7.5YR4/6) compact sandy
clay to a depth of 35-60 centimeters below the surface underlain by strong
brown (7.5YR4/6) clay.
No ROE was granted for the Lee Graves or JRC Land & Cattle properties in the
southern portion of this segment. Neither property was currently being utilized
and offered low surface visibility from the vantage of the existing TxDOT ROW
(Figure 32). From limited observation no cultural material was noted as present
in either property adjacent to the existing ROW. At the southern end of the JRC
Land & Cattle Property an area of disturbance consisting of an artificial rise
adjacent to an access road and capped by a juncture of gas pipelines was
documented (Figure 33).

CR 4800 to CR 2051 (Plate 6-7)
The CR 4800 to CR 2051 segment begins in the north in the property of B. J.
Lambright for which ROE was granted. This property is a cultivated field with
excellent surface visibility. Near the north end of the property a very low density
scatter of burned caliche, lithic debitage and a medial biface fragment was
recorded as a unknown aged prehistoric Site 41MT43 (see below for further
discussion). Six shovel tests were dug in relation to this site. Survey in the
southern portions of the property did not identify any additional prehistoric or
historic cultural material. South of this northern Lambright property the
proposed ROW crosses the northwest corner of an agricultural field owned by F.
Deatherage. ROE for this property was granted and survey of this field with
excellent visibility did not identify any archeological materials. South of this
property the proposed ROW enters a property owned by G. L. Snell for which no
ROE was provided. Approximately half way through the Snell property, which is
cultivated and presents excellent surface visibility, the proposed ROW crosses to
the western side of the existing SH 349 into more property owned by B. J.
Lambright. Within the Lambright property, which is uncultivated, surface
visibility was low to moderate requiring that three shovel tests (BJ#50, BJ#51,
MS#57) be dug to assess the possible presence of cultural material. All shovel
tests were negative. At the southern end of this Lambright property, the
proposed ROW passes through the northeast corner of a property owned by
Paige Echols for which no ROE was granted. This property has low to moderate
surface visibility but is also clearly disturbed by the presence of several
transmission lines and access roads (Figure 34). South of the Paige Echols
property more property owned by B. J. Lambright was surveyed. The ground
visibility was low to moderate throughout the northern portions of this property.
As a result four shovel tests were placed in areas of low visibility (MS#58,
MS#59, BJ#52, BJ#53). All four shovel tests were negative for cultural materials.
At the southern end of this Lambright property surface visibility was much
improved (50-90%).
Near the middle of this B. J. Lambright property, disturbance associated with
the Patricia Substation operated by Seminole Pipeline was documented in the
proposed ROW (Figure 35). South of the Patricia Substation where the proposed
ROW continues to pass west of SH 349 there is extensive disturbance present
throughout the proposed ROW in the B. J. Lambright, W. P. Hatchett and
Jimmy G. Brown properties (all granted ROE). At least two subsurface gas lines
â one natural gas and another poisonous gas â run south paralleling SH 349
through the proposed ROW (Figure 36). On the eastern edge of the proposed
ROW a buried fiber optic cable is present and an overhead transmission line.
Additional disturbance associated with access roads to oil field sites and gas
lines that connect with the north south lines occur regularly throughout this
southern portion of the segment. At the southernmost terminus of this segment
on the Jimmy G. Brown property, there is a large area of disturbance where
numerous gas lines converge on the west edge of SH 349, apparently before
passing under the highway to a large gas processing or pumping station on the
east side of the highway outside of the proposed ROW (Figures 37, 38).

This long segment is the largest area in the project area where no ROE was
granted. The property in this segment is held by either R. B. Holt et. al. or J. G.
Mabee. In the northernmost portion the proposed ROW crosses SH 349 to again
parallel the eastern edge of the existing ROW. In this same area the project area
also crosses Mustang Draw. Mustang Draw is nearly imperceptible, marked by
broad low valley with rises on both sides (Figure 39). The draw has no clearly
defined channel. Surface visibility is low in lower portions of the draw, which are
overgrown with short and tall grasses and wildflowers. Disturbance is evident on
the surface of the existing ROW where road base covers much of the surface of
the rise north of the draw and concrete retaining walls have been placed in the
ROW to minimize erosion (Figure 40, 41). Originally, backhoe trenching had
been proposed for properties crossing Mustang Draw. However, owing to the fact
that ROE was not granted in this area and five shovel tests (RF#8, MS#5, MS#6,
BJ#9, BJ#10) in the existing ROW demonstrated significant disturbance within
the existing ROW, no backhoe trenching was conducted. The five shovel tests all
indicated that the construction of the highway had disturbed the deposits in the
existing ROW in a manner consistent with that observed elsewhere in the project
area. Modern trash and road base are present in the upper 40 to 80 centimeters
of deposits, and sterile compact sandy clay is present below. No evidence of
cultural material was noted on the surface or in the shovel tests. However, a
white cross with a red plate was situated at the top of the rise above Mustang
Draw on the west edge of the existing ROW commemorating the death of Sue
Allen Scism due to an accident on November 5, 1972 (Figure 42).
Throughout the remainder of the segment efforts were made to assess the
possibility of cultural materials in the proposed ROW from the existing ROW.
Generally, this land is uncultivated and has poor to moderate surface visibility,

oriented subsurface gas lines, access roads, a large cleared area with two oil
tanks (3.8 miles south of CR 2051 on Mabee property), and a large âstock tankâ
(2,460 feet (750 meters) north of SH 176 on Holt property) resulted in isolated
disturbance to the proposed ROW visible from the existing ROW (Figures 43,
44). In attempting to assess the proposed ROW, particular focus was placed on
rises near playas, since prehistoric and historic archeological sites occur on
these landforms both in the project area and in the broader region. While
significant modification of the existing ROW was documented, no cultural
materials were identified at any point along the segment. North of SH176 on the
Holt property a large stock tank or similar construction was documented as
clear disturbance within the proposed ROW. Within this northern area of the
Holt property plans are for the proposed ROW to be straightened and moved
further east of the current road than is typical in the project area (Figure 45,
Plate 9). An improved interchange is proposed for this area as well. None of
these proposed ROW areas or improvements could be assessed from the existing
ROW due to a lack of ROE.

SH176 to CR3200 (Plates 10-12)
The northern end of this long segment continues crossing Mabee and Holt
properties to which no ROE had been granted. Both properties are uncultivated
range land and oil leases. Here the proposed SH 349 ROW varies in its location

relative to the existing ROW, being situated on Holt property on the eastern side
of SH 349 as it crosses under SH 176, before crossing to the western side of SH
349 in the southern portion of the Mabee property. Surface visibility from the
existing ROW for both properties was low to good (30-60%). From the existing
ROW no cultural materials were observed. A small playa is present near the SH
176 overpass on the west side of the road and a larger playa is present on the
eastern side of the road in the southern portion of the Holt property. An access
road leading to oil and gas drilling equipment has also impacted the proposed
ROW on the Holt property.
South of the Mabee property where the proposed ROW continues along the
western side of SH 349 it crosses a series of small properties. The first is the
Mrs. W. S. Kelton property. ROE was granted to this property. In the proposed
ROW the property has been completely disturbed through the construction of a
large oil or gas refining or pumping station (Figure 46). Here the surface has
been stripped and resurfaced and several different structures constructed. The
adjacent L. F. Cowden property also had ROE granted. Here the surface visibility
was low to moderate (15-50%). Three shovel tests (MS#60, BJ#54, BJ#55) were
excavated in this property to investigate the possibility of cultural resources. All
three shovel tests were negative for cultural resources and encountered a layer
of compact brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay with increasing caliche content with
depth. Impenetrable caliche was encountered from 18 to 45 centimeters below
surface. In addition, disturbance was recorded along the eastern edge of the
proposed ROW were a small dirt road with two visible ruts paralleled the
fenceline (Figure 47). Within this dirt track numerous caliche cobbles were
visible on the surface, indicating disturbance. The E. F. Kelton property south of
the Cowden property was only minimally in the proposed ROW as it again moves
to the eastern side of SH 349 and back on to the Holt property. In this property
within the proposed ROW the small dirt track was present indicating clear
subsurface disturbance.
After crossing back to the eastern side of SH 349 onto the Holt property, the
proposed ROW quickly proceeds onto a large parcel of land owned by C.
Scharbauer Jr.. From this point the proposed ROW continues along the eastern
side of the SH 349 for the remainder of this segment. As ROE was granted for
the Scharbauer property, it was completely surveyed through this segment. Near
the northern end where it abuts the Holt property, a slight rise and adjacent
upland south of a playa was found to have a light to moderate density scatter of
historic artifacts and small surface features from the twentieth century. This
scatter was registered as site 41MT44 and six shovel tests were excavated in
association (see Site Discussion section). Survey throughout this extensive
Scharbauer property encountered a wide range of surface conditions with
surface visibility ranging from low (15%) to excellent (90%) (Figures 48, 49).
Broadly speaking, except in areas near or in two playas, the northern portions of
the Scharbauer area had higher surface visibility, in part due to recent burning
of the ground surface. As a result less intensive shovel testing was conducted
with twenty shovel tests dug in areas of lower visibility in the northern portion
(BJ#39-49, MS#48-56). In the final approximately 1.45 miles (2,340 meters) of
the Scharbauer property, surface visibility was consistently poorer (less than
30%) and 24 shovel tests were dug at approximately 328 foot (100 meter)
intervals in this portion of the project area. With the exception of shovel tests
dug within the boundaries of 41MT44, all shovel tests were negative for cultural
materials. Soils within the shovel tests tended towards deeper sandy loams in
the northern portions and shallow sandy clays with caliche in the south.

Throughout the project area within this Scharbauer property, evidence of an old
dirt track was intermittently observed running along the eastern edge of the
property fenceline, resulting in disturbance to western edge of the proposed
ROW. Occasional buried gas lines were also noted.
The final property in this segment is owned by EDMC and entry was not
granted. The property is a plowed and cultivated field with excellent surface
visibility (Figure 50). Survey along the edge of the property did not identify any
cultural materials.

The final segment of the proposed SH 349 improvement begins along the eastern
edge of SH 349 in a property owned by J. G. Mabee et. al., and for which no
ROE was granted. It then switches to the western side of SH 349 where it
continues on Mabee property and then crosses onto property owned jointly by

George W. Gass and Monta Johnson, which also was unable to be surveyed due
to a lack of access. Both the Mabee et. al. and the Gass and Johnson properties
are uncultivated range land and have multiple oil jacks and access roads.
Surface visibility in both was low to good (20-60%). From the existing ROW no
cultural materials were observed.
South of the Gass and Johnson property, the proposed ROW again switches to
the eastern side of SH 349 and onto lands owned exclusively by Monta Johnson
(the Johnson Ranch). ROE to this property had been granted and the proposed
ROW throughout this property was fully surveyed. In general, surface visibility
was less than 30% and 23 shovel tests (MS#20-21, BJ#27-31, RF#26-31) were
excavated at 100 meter intervals except were significant disturbance was
present. All of the shovel tests were negative for cultural materials. Typical
shovel tests encountered compact yellow-red (10YR5/4) sandy clay overlaying
caliche at a depth from 15-25 centimeters below the surface. At the main
entrance to the Johnson Ranch, extensive disturbance as noted in association
with the gate and an access road and subsurface waterline being built (Figure
51). Additional disturbance was noted associated with occasional subsurface
gas lines on the property. Finally, evidence of a dirt track nearly identical to the
one on the Scharbauer property was recorded along the western edge of the
current fenceline (and western edge of the proposed ROW) south of the Johnson
Ranch entrance and continuing to the end of the property (Figure 52). The track
is roughly 10 feet (3 meters) wide, with two shallow ruts and occasional wooden
fence posts marking the eastern edge. Where the track is present the subsurface
deposits have clearly been disturbed, marked by the presence of significant
quantities of caliche cobbles on the surface.
South of the Johnson property the proposed ROW crosses onto lands owned by
G. H. Gass and for which no ROE was provided. Surface visibility was low to
moderate and no cultural materials were identified on the surface from the
existing ROW. A single access road presents the only clear disturbance to the
property.
In the final approximately 4,724.41 feet (1,440 meters) of proposed ROW at the
southern terminus of the project area, the proposed ROW switches back to the
western side of SH 349. This property is owned by C. Scharbauer Jr. and ROE
was granted. Survey of the property encountered low to moderate surface
visibility, with areas of exposed caliche visible on the surface (Figure 53).
Fourteen shovel tests (BJ#22-26, MS#15-19, RF#22-25) were excavated within
this property. All shovel tests were negative for cultural materials and
encountered shallow yellowish-red (10YR5/4) sandy clay soils overlying caliche
at depths ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters below surface. In addition a buried
fiber optic cable runs along the eastern edge of the proposed ROW in this
property, as it does through all properties on the western side of SH 349.

SITE DISCUSSIONS
Five new archeological sites were recorded during the course of the survey of the
proposed SH 349 improvements. In this section a description of each of these
sites is presented. Because right-of-entry was restricted to 150 feet beyond the
existing TxDOT ROW, lateral definitions of site boundaries are in several cases
arbitrarily fixed at the edge or slightly beyond the proposed ROW based on the
presence of artifacts within the area of ROE, not full assessment of the possible
extent of these sites from systematic surface or subsurface observations.
Notably, all sites were located on the upper slopes and tops of uplands
surrounding playas. This pattern is well established in the regional archeological
literature and doubtless reflects the importance of available water for sustaining
both local human and animal populations. As such the results of this survey
contribute to the construction of a basic predictive model for the location of
archeological sites, particularly prehistoric and Protohistoric sites. In those
areas adjacent to playas, the likelihood of encountering archeological sites is
clearly the highest. Though survey and shovel testing within the existing ROW
in Mustang Draw failed to encounter any cultural resources, based on previous
investigations in the region and in the South Plains in general, the uplands
adjacent to draws also represent areas of high probability for encountering
archeological sites. In contrast, upland areas away from playas and draws
represent areas of low probability for encountering archeological sites,
particularly prehistoric sites. Though this model was applicable to historic sites
within the surveyed areas of the proposed SH 349 ROW, the model seems
particularly well suited for predicting the likelihood of encountering prehistoric
sites. The probability of encountering historic sites associated with European
settlement and occupation of the region is still considered to be potentially
higher in areas away from playas and draws, and will require additional
research to further refine the applicability of this model to sites of this period.

41DS13
Site 41DS13 is a moderately dense surface scatter of historic artifacts located on
the eastern side of SH 349 in southern Dawson County on a slight rise above a
large playa located 820.29 feet (250 meters) to the southeast (Figures 54, 55).
Currently the site is located in an actively cultivated corn field on private
property belonging to Donald Vogler. Based on the presence of surface artifacts,
the site area was delineated entirely within the proposed ROW at 344.49 feet
(105 meters) north-south by 98.43 feet (30 meters) east-west (.79 acres (3,150
sq. meters), though modern agriculture has clearly displaced many of the
surface artifacts (Figure 56). The densest area of artifacts was observed near the
top of the rise approximately 49.21-114.83 feet (15-35 meters) east of the
current road.
Across the site the soil is a red-brown sandy loam belonging to the Amarillo
association. Six shovel tests were dug to determine site boundaries and to
investigate for the possibility of intact buried components (Table 2). Though
three shovel tests recorded small numbers of fragmented historic remains to
depths of up to 40 centimeters below surface, this depth remained within the
range of plow zone, and it is believed that the vertical distribution of artifacts is
a factor of the disturbance to the site resulting from agricultural land use
patterns. No evidence for intact structural features was observed and there is no
indication that intact deposits exist within the project area.

The artifacts observed and collected from the surface and the shovel tests
consist primarily of typical twentieth century household items such as clear,
green and brown bottle glass and container shards, milk glass container
fragments, whiteware and glazed stoneware sherds, shell buttons, and two glass
marbles (Figure 57). One of the clear glass fragments is a portion of the body of
an embossed Coca-Cola bottle. A neck and handle of a brown glass bottle is
similar to many bleach bottles or other cleaning supplies. Other artifacts of note
included nails, window glass, modern brick and a porcelain electric fence
insulator, all architectural elements suggesting a structure may once have been
present. Several metal artifacts of unknown function, including a brass valve,
were found that may pertain to architectural elements or activities such as
farming practiced by the residents. Overall the artifacts appear to date to the
1940âs. Though temporally specific diagnostic attributes were generally missing
from the collection, embossing on an Owens-Illinois bottle base indicates a date
of 1943 based on the presence of an embossed âDuraglasâ logo and â3.â found to
the right of the bottle manufacturing mark (Lockhart 2004). No other artifacts in
the collection suggest that the assemblage consists of objects manufactured
prior to the 1940âs. All of the glass bottles appear to be made in an Automatic
Bottle Machine and have screw caps, and none of the glass uses manganese
bleaching to achieve a clear color.
Deed research indicates that this property was originally surveyed as part of
Section 34, Block 36, Township 5 of the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company
Survey in Dawson County. Though property ownership was not well documented
in the Dawson County Clerks files, it appears that the current owner Donald
Vogler acquired the property as an 87.5 acre tract from Ernest G. Carr in 1975
(Dawson County Deed Records Vol. 320: 412). Carr had in turn purchased the
property from O. M. Murphy on May 12, 1959 (Dawson County Deed Records
Vol. 170: 449). Though the original deed for Murphyâs purchase was not found
in the Dawson County Deed Records dating back to the turn of the century, no
other deeds or evidence for sale were present either, strongly suggesting that the
property had been in Murphyâs hands for some time and very likely long before

the 1940âs period to which the diagnostic artifacts date. A search for O. M.
Murphy in the Handbook of Texas was negative.
Based on the artifacts present on the site, 41DS13 is interpreted as a scatter of
1940âs historic artifacts likely associated with a small residence or field house
located on the property when it was in the possession of O.M. Murphy. It is not
clear if any structure that would have been present here was the house of a
tenant, the owners, or possibly a field house associated with ranching or
agricultural activities on the site. The density of the remains and the lack of
much time depth strongly argue in favor of an interpretation that whatever the
function of the property, it was not a significant residence. The seemingly
constricted time period for the artifacts and the lack of any intact architectural
remains suggest that any residence that may have once stood on the site has
been completely demolished. The site may also represent a dump of materials
from elsewhere. Based on the lack of site integrity and the poor research
possibilities presented by this site, Hicks & Company archeologists do not find
that this site is eligible for the National Register under any of the criteria, nor do
we find that the site is eligible for listing as a State Archeological Landmark.

Figure 56: Example of artifacts collected from site surface of 41DS13

41DS14
Site 41DS14 is a low density scatter of burned caliche and lithic manufacturing
debris and tools located on a hilltop on the east side of SH 349 from which four
different playas are visible (Figure 57, 58). The site is bisected by CR 26 and is
currently being actively cultivated for cotton. Site size was calculated as 1.89
acres (7,650 square meters) based on the surface distribution of artifacts within
the project ROW (Figure 59). The north-south axis was able to be firmly
established at a length of 557.74 feet (170 meters). The site extends to the east
outside of the proposed ROW. As artifact counts tended to be slightly higher on
the eastern edge of the site, especially in the portions south of CR 26, it is
assumed that the site is actually larger and extends further to the east, though
to what degree the current authors cannot speculate.
Six shovel tests were dug to define the boundaries of the site and to identify any
potentially buried and intact archeological deposits (Table 3). The shovel tests
encountered Amarillo series red-brown fine sandy loam to depths of over 80
centimeters. Only two shovel tests were found to be positive for cultural
material, with artifacts found to a depth of 20 centimeters within the active plow
zone. Based on the results of shovel testing and the presence of artifacts on the
surface, the site has no intact buried archeological deposits or features, and has
been severely disturbed by the effects of agriculture.

Artifacts documented at the site were all lithic materials including stone tools,
manufacturing debris and burned rock (Figure 60). Artifact density per square
meter averaged only 1-2 artifacts per square meter. Two areas of higher artifact
concentrations were noted, and overall the southeast sector of the site exhibited
a slightly higher incidence of artifact recovery. The four stone tools found
during the survey were all made of chert and included three edge modified flakes
and a uniface. The edge modified flakes were all tertiary flakes less than 4
centimeters in size and exhibited minute flaking and edge damage along at least
one edge. All three specimens were from differently colored chert source
materials. One example was found in shovel test RF#10, and the remaining
examples were collected from the site surface. The uniface, collected from the
surface along the edge of CR 26, was manufactured on a secondary flake of grey
chert with brown and white mottles removed from a small cobble with a tanwhite cortex. The edge opposite the cortex has been systematically chipped to
form a steep edge and was likely used as an end scraper. Twenty three pieces of
manufacturing debris were also documented. Most were generally small in size,
ranging from less than one to approximately four centimeters in length, and all
but two were tertiary flakes. One piece was a fine grained purple quartzite, and
the remaining specimens consisted of cherts of a wide range of colors.
Based on the types of artifacts observed and the location of the site, site 41DS14
appears to have functioned as a small campsite for prehistoric peoples. The lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts makes it impossible to date the site. The
location of the site seems to be particularly salient to its choice as a campsite
given the excellent visibility afforded of the local landscape from this higher
vantage as well as the accessibility to water provided by the four playas that
surround the site. The lack of evidence for intact occupation surfaces or
features, the disturbance of the site by modern agricultural practices, and the
lack of research potential makes the portion of the site within the proposed ROW
ineligible for either listing on the National Register of Historic Places or as a
State Archeological Landmark. Since the same conditions apply outside the
proposed ROW, it is the recommendation of the Principal Investigator that the
site as a whole does not have potential to be listed on the NRHP or as an SAL.
Thus no further work is recommended for site 41DS14.

41MT42
Site 41MT42 is a very low density scatter of lithic manufacturing debris and
burned caliche of unknown age located on a rise on the south side of a playa in
the proposed ROW on the eastern side of SH 349 in northern Martin County
(Figures 61, 62). The site is located on the property of the KNAB Corporation,
and is currently unused. The ground surface is covered in short and tall grasses
and mesquite trees with a surface visibility between 40-70 percent. Based on the
presence of artifacts on the surface, the site size is mapped as 213.25 feet (65
meters) in length northeast-southwest and 98.43 feet (30 meters) in width
northwest-southeast for a total area of .73 acres (2,950 square meters) (Figure
63). The site extends an unknown distance outside the proposed ROW to the
east. A dramatic topographic rise occurs east of the site and appears to ring the
south and east sides of the adjacent playa. It is unclear if this landscape feature
represents an actual natural formation or is an artificial rise constructed in the
past during the preparation of adjoining agricultural fields.
Six shovel tests were placed within the area of Site 41MT42 in order to assess
the possibility of intact subsurface deposits or features and to delineate the site
boundaries (Table 4). All six shovel tests were negative for cultural materials
and encountered Amarillo fine sandy loam to depths of 40-75 centimeters below
the surface underlain by compact clay.

Artifact density on the surface was very low with artifacts found scattered across
the surface as isolated individual specimens (Figure 64). No concentrations
were noted across the site. The most common artifacts were small pieces of grey,
burned caliche less than 5 centimeters in size. A total of ten tertiary chert flakes
were recorded on the surface. Most chert was a yellow-white to tan-brown color
with a single dark grey piece, but was not collected. At least two examples
appeared to have been burned.
Based on the debitage and burned caliche, the site appears to have served as a
short term campsite for prehistoric people. The lack of diagnostic artifacts
makes placement of the site within the regional archeological chronology
impossible. The chert manufacturing debris suggests that at least some
resharpening of tools or flake manufacture was occurring on site, and the
burned caliche hints at the presence of hearth features on site at one time.
However, natural erosion and modern land use practices appear to have
disturbed the site and compromised the site integrity. The lack of intact
subsurface occupation surfaces or features further indicates that the site has
little or no future research potential. As a result, the portion of Site 41MT42
located within the proposed ROW contains no elements that have potential to
contribute to the siteâs overall eligibility for the NRHP or as an SAL. Hicks &
Company recommends that no additional work is necessary for site 41MT42
within the proposed ROW.

41MT43
Site 41MT43 consists of a very dispersed scatter of burned caliche and two lithic
artifacts located in an active cotton field belonging to B. J. Lambright in the
proposed SH 349 ROW on the east side of SH 349 in northern Martin County
(Figure 65). The site is located on the upper portions of a very gentle slope
overlooking a playa 984.25 feet (300 meters) to the west. The site size was
measured at 377.27 feet (115 meters) northeast-southwest and 98.43 feet (30
meters) northwest-southeast or .85 acres (3.450 square meters) (Figure 66).
Based on the occurrence of surface artifacts, the site does not extend outside of
the proposed ROW.
Six shovel tests were dug within the site boundaries to assess for the possibility
of intact subsurface deposits and features (Table 5). All six shovel tests were
negative for cultural materials and encountered a deep deposit of Amarillo fine
sandy loam to a depth of approximately 50 centimeters below surface underlain
by compact sandy clay. Surface inspection of the property on the opposite side
of SH 349 did not reveal any evidence of artifacts west of the site boundary as it
was mapped.

Artifacts encountered on site consisted of approximately 20 small pieces of
burned caliche scattered across the site surface in very low density (Figure 67).
The only other items of prehistoric age were a piece of secondary chert debitage
and a medial biface fragment (Figure 68). The biface fragment was
manufactured on a flake of gray chert and is finely worked on the dorsal face
and minimally worked on the ventral face. The ventral face also exhibited
potlidding. The size and thinness of the piece suggests it may be a medial
fragment of a dart point.
The presence of burned caliche, a piece of debitage and a broken chert bifacial
tool suggest this area served as an ephemeral campsite for prehistoric people.
Unfortunately, the lack of diagnostic artifacts makes ascertaining the period of
habitation impossible. The lack of intact subsurface features or occupation
surfaces, in conjunction with the clearly disturbed nature of the site due to
cultivation, render the site of little or no future research value. In light of this,
Site 41MT43 is not considered eligible for listing on the NRHP or as an SAL.
Hicks & Company archeologists recommend that no further work is required for
this site.

Site 41MT44 is a scatter of twentieth century domestic and architectural
artifacts associated with a concrete âtroughâ, a roughly circular concentration of
stone, and two metal poles anchored in the ground. The site is located on the
northern end of the Scharbauer property on the east side of SH 349 just south

of the intersection with SH 176, and situated on a rise above a playa located 328
feet (100 meters) to the north (Figure 69). The site size, based on the extent of
the surface artifact scatter, was measured at 426.52 feet (130 meters) northsouth and 131.23 feet (40 meters) east-west, for a total area of 1.28 acres (5,200
square meters) (Figure 70). The site extends from the eastern edge of the
current TxDOT ROW to the approximate limit of the proposed ROW, and is
entirely within the proposed ROW. Based on the artifact scatter and features
identified on the surface, the site appears to have served as a residence or field
house for ranching, farming, or oil and gas extraction activities. In general
artifact densities were highest in the southwestern portions of the site near the
current TxDOT ROW and west of the visible surface features. In addition, pieces
of machine made brick were found scattered on the surface for at least 60
meters to the north of the primary artifact scatters and features. This
widespread distribution of brick on the surface strongly suggests that a brick
structure was present on the site and then demolished. Subsequently, or
possibly as a consequence of the demolition, the construction material became
widely dispersed across the general area.
The site surface is covered with short and tall grasses, mesquite and various
cacti. Surface visibility was good, ranging from 50-75%. Six shovel tests were
placed within the site boundaries to assess the potential for intact buried
deposits and further assist in delineating the site boundaries (Table 6). With the
exception of shovel test MS#42 from which a piece of graphite-like material of
unknown function was recovered 30 centimeters below the surface, shovel
testing did not suggest the presence of any intact subsurface deposits. Soils at
the site consisted of a strong brown (6.5YR4/6) compact sand or a yellowish
brown (7.5YR5/4) sand to a depth of at least 50 centimeters below the surface.

The artifacts observed and recorded on the site consisted of a variety of domestic
materials and architectural elements (Figure 71). Domestic type artifacts
included glass bottles and containers of clear, brown, blue, green and milk
glass, whiteware and porcelain ceramics, rusted cans, and a metal sieve likely
for flour. Notable among the glass domestic wares were a complete brown bottle
- likely a container for hydrogen peroxide - and a partial milk glass cream jar
with the Ponds brand name on the base; both reflect personal hygiene and
medical items commonly found on twentieth century sites. The brown glass
bottle had an Owens-Illinois makerâs mark on the base with an âIâ inside an âOâ
with the number 7 in the date mark location. This version of the company logo
was not utilized until at least 1954, and the 7 at the right likely indicates a date
of 1957. Other bottles likely related to kitchen activities included numerous
fragments of clear, green and brown bottles. An oval clear glass base bore an

earlier Owens-Illinois makerâs mark â the âIâ in the âOâ inside a triangle â with a
date mark that may indicate 1936 or 1946 (Lockhart 2004). The ceramics
recovered included a diverse assortment of transfer printed and glazed
whiteware plate, bowl and cup fragments as well as a piece of transfer printed
porcelain and a glazed earthenware. None of the ceramics bore makerâs marks.
Architectural elements included metal hinges and over twenty orange paste
bricks that were all broken. The bricks were embossed with the âGroesbeckâ
name. Though it is plausible to suggest that Groesbeck bricks may have been
manufactured in the town of Groesbeck in Limestone County, Texas, research
could not identify when the company existed or where it was precisely located.
Several of the bricks still had a white mortar with large aggregate adhered to
them. A porcelain electric fence insulator was also collected that was marked
âBRUNTâ. The G.F. Brunt company of East Liverpool, Ohio manufactured and
sold these types of insulators from approximately 1900-1914 (http://www.rÂ­
infinity.com/Companies/index.htm). While the electric fence insulator does
suggest an artifact that dates to the first two decades of the twentieth century,
in light of the two temporally diagnostic bottle marks and the general character
of the observed artifact scatter, the site was occupied primarily between the midÂ­
1930âs and possibly into the late 1950âs or 1960âs.
In addition to artifacts, the survey of the site also identified three surface
features that may have been associated with a no longer stranding structure.
The first of these is a rectangular concrete âtroughâ placed into the ground near
the southeastern portion of the site (Figure 72). The opening of this feature is
5.05 feet (154 centimeters) in length and 1.02 feet (33 centimeters) in width, the
depth was greater than one foot but the presence of trash and dirt fill did not
permit a full measurement of the depth. It is not clear what the purpose of this
feature was. Approximately 20 feet (6 meters) to the northwest of the trough was
an approximately 16 by 16 foot (5 X 5 meter) area of stones 4-8 inches 10-20
centimeters) in size (Figure 73). Though no clear organization of the stones
could be ascertained that would help in determining their functional purpose,
one group of stones in the southwestern portion of the stone scatter appeared to
have a roughly circular organization. It is possible that these stones represent
old remnants of a foundation. Near the southern boundary of the site area two
metal poles were identified. The first was 2.4 inches (6 centimeters) in diameter
and placed vertically, reaching a height of 2.62 feet (80 centimeters) above the
surface (Figure 74). The second metal pole was located 5.25 feet (160
centimeters) southwest of the first and was smaller at 1.57 inches (4
centimeters) in diameter (Figure 75). This pole appeared to enter the ground at
an angle, though it only extended less than 4 inches (10 centimeters) above the
current surface. The poles appear to be standard metal poles for fencing, and
these poles may be remnants of a small fence or gate related to a now destroyed
building and the associated artifact scatter.
Deed research at the Martin County courthouse was able to establish the chain
of title for this property. The site is located in Tract 323 of the Lasalle County
School Land. Tract 323 is part of a larger grant of land described in the original
patent given by Governor John Ireland on September 1, 1883 to the County of
Lasalle (Martin County Deed Records Vol. 9: 183). In 1893 Tract 323 was part of
a land purchase by Ed Woodall, Patrick E. Hooks, W. J. Robertson and Ed
Wilkenson (Martin County Deed Records Vol. 3: 103). Subsequently, Clarence
Scharbauer purchased Tract 323 from the aforementioned individuals for the
Scharbauer Cattle Company in 1917 (Martin County Deed Records Vol. 16:
506). Clarence Scharbauer, who moved to Midland, Texas in 1889, became a

significant member of the community after becoming manager of Scharbauer
Cattle Company, an enterprise he entered into with his uncle and brother
(Connor 2001). The Scharbauer Cattle Company dissolved in 1912 and then
reincorporated in 1914. The Scharbauer family has since remained important
cattle ranchers in the area, and the purchase of Tract 323 in 1917 marks an
example of the continued growth of the Scharbauer Cattle Company after its
reincorporation. The property remains in the Scharbauer familyâs possession to
this day.
In 1935, Clarence Scharbauer also became increasingly involved in the oil and
gas industry after oil was found on his properties, though his interests in oil and
gas developed earlier. Shortly after purchasing Tract 323 in 1917, actions were
taken by Clarence Scharbauer in May of 1919 to lease this property as well as
Tracts 324 and 325 to the Trustees of Midland Tulsa Oil Company for gas
exploration (Martin County Deed Records Vol. 18: 207). Interestingly, the
trustees included O. B. Holt (whose family currently retains very large land
holdings in the SH 349 project corridor and the property just north of 41MT44),
G. W. Walcott, and Clarence Scharbauer himself. Ultimately the lease was
voided in September of 1919 due the inability of the Midland Tulsa Oil Company
to complete incorporation. Of note in the first lease proceedings was a
stipulation by Scharbauer to provide free gas service for the stove and lights to a
house and barn within the lease. Unfortunately more specific information on the
location of these structures is not given, but the dates seem too early for the
artifact assemblage at 41MT44. In 1938, however, the Scharbauer Cattle
Company did lease part of Tract 323 to the British American Oil Company &
Sunray Oil Company for oil and gas exploration and extraction (Oil, Gas &
Mineral Lease Records Vol. 4: 157).
Based on the dating of the artifacts and the use of the land as both cattle
pasturage by the Scharbauer Cattle Company from 1917 until the present, and
for oil and gas extraction beginning in the 1930âs, the artifact scatter and
features observed at Site 41MT44 likely represent occupation related to these
activities. Considering that the area continues to be used for gas and oil
extraction, the transient nature of the site occupation, and the lack of any other
residential dwellings in the vicinity, it seems most reasonable to assume that
this site may have been a small field house associated with a period of oil and
gas exploration on the property. Once the lease expired and/or the resources on
the property were tapped, the site may have been abandoned and the house
demolished in order to return the property to cattle grazing lands.
Given the lack of intact subsurface deposits and the low probability that the site
has the potential to contribute to our understanding of the history of the region,
this site is not considered to be eligible for listing on the NRHP or as an SAL.
Hicks & Company recommends no additional research is necessary for Site
41MT44.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an intensive linear archeological
survey along the 42.5 mile length of the proposed SH 349 Highway Improvement
project in Dawson and Martin counties. Because of limited ROE to properties
within the project area, intensive survey was restricted to only 51% of the
proposed ROW and to the existing ROW. Properties to which archeologists did
not have ROE were subject to reconnaissance level survey as could best be
performed given the conditions of the property and the ground surface visibility.
The survey was completed in July of 2007 on behalf of the Texas Department of
Transportation.
Within the existing ROW, archeologists observed significant disturbance to
deposits resulting from the grading and filling of the roadbed, the cutting of
drainage ditches alongside the roadway and the placement of drainage features
under the roadway. In addition, transmission lines, subsurface gas lines, and
access roads were present within the TxDOT ROW resulting in additional
disturbance to natural deposits. The results of 11 shovel tests within the
existing ROW and surface inspection supported these observations indicating
that deposits were extensively disturbed and mixed to depths of 1-3.3 feet (30Â­
100 centimeters). Even where sites were encountered during the survey of the
proposed ROW, inspection of the adjacent ROW repeatedly demonstrated that
artifacts were consistently absent, suggesting that highway construction has
already possibly destroyed portions of sites within the ROW. This is not
surprising given the lack of subsurface deposits associated with these sites.
Based on these observations it is the opinion of Hicks & Company that there is
no potential for deposits in the existing ROW to contain intact cultural
materials. As a result, any construction within the existing ROW is
recommended to proceed without further investigation.
Within the proposed expanded ROW archeologists were granted access to
approximately 20.969 linear miles (275.51 acres) of private land to survey for
cultural resources. During the course of surveying these properties 149 shovel
tests were dug, only six of which were positive for cultural materials. Within the
areas of proposed ROW that were able to be surveyed, five archeological sites
were identified as well as a scatter of burned rock and an isolated chert flake.
These latter two discoveries were recorded but not deemed sufficiently
significant to warrant registration as archeological sites, much less as NRHP or
as SALâs. Site 41DS13 is a medium density scatter of various historic glass,
metal and ceramic artifacts dating to the early to mid-twentieth century. The site
is disturbed by cultivation and there are no associated features. The site
appears to be the remnants of either a badly disturbed farmstead or an
accumulation of dumped historic debris. Site 41MT44 is also an early to midtwentieth century historic site with a scatter of metal, glass and ceramic
artifacts. In addition, several features including a concrete trough, metal poles
and a possibly intentional accumulation of rock were identified and mapped as
part of this site. Shovel testing showed no intact subsurface components, and
the site appears to be a demolished field house or homestead associated with
ranching, farming or oil drilling activities occurring on the property. Site 41DS14
is a prehistoric site of unknown age situated on a low hill with views of four
surrounding playas. The site is composed of a surface scatter of burned caliche,
lithic debitage, and non-diagnostic tools, and the site appears to have functioned
as a prehistoric campsite. Though two artifacts were found within the upper 20
centimeters of the soil, site deposits have been heavily disturbed by plowing of

Conclusions and Recommendations

the property and no intact deposits are present. Site 41MT42 is another surface
scatter of burned caliche and lithic debitage of unknown edge located on a low
rise near a playa. No tools, diagnostic artifacts or intact features were identified.
Site 41MT43 is the final prehistoric site and consists of a medial biface fragment
and very low density scatter of burned caliche and a piece of debitage. Again, no
intact features or temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered and the site
appears to be the remains of a small campsite of unknown age that has been
completely disturbed by plowing.
In summary none of the five archeological sites investigated exhibited evidence
for the presence of buried or intact subsurface features or contexts or additional
research potential. Their greatest research value consists of being identified and
registered as archeological sites contributing to settlement pattern information
for the regional landscape. As a result of the low site integrity and the lack of
potential for substantive new information to be gathered through additional
investigations, none of the identified sites are being recommended for additional
testing and none of the sites are eligible for registration on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) or for nomination as State Archeological Landmarks
(SALâs). It is thus recommended that the within the portions of the proposed
ROW that have been fully archeologically surveyed that the project may proceed
to construction without any further investigation.
Finally, Hicks & Company archeologists attempted to assess the potential for
those properties in the proposed ROW for which ROE was not granted to have
cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed improvements to SH
349. Decisions to recommend additional survey for properties for which no ROE
was given were predicated on the following criteria: (1) surface visibility, (2)
general location on the landscape, and (3) likelihood of containing intact
deposits. The first criterion, surface visibility, was the most significant in terms
of being able to assess the proposed ROW on a property. In those properties
where the fields were currently under cultivation, surface visibility was superb
and allowed a thorough visual assessment to be made. In contrast, uncultivated
tracts of land generally had poor to good surface visibility, but due to the
vegetation it was only possible to assess the proposed ROW within a narrow
tract immediately adjacent to the existing ROW. As a result, only properties that
were actively cultivated at the time of the survey were recommended for
clearance. The other two criteria are based on the results of the survey within
the proposed ROW where access was granted. Results of the survey indicated
that the probability of encountering an archeological site within the project area
was highest on the upland high points adjacent to playas. Thus properties
where such topographic features are present are considered as having a higher
probability of containing archeological sites and were recommended for
additional survey. The third criterion reflects the observation that all sites within
the project area were surficial in nature and clearly lacked integrity when
encountered within active agricultural fields. In practice the third and first
criteria are interdependent. Based on these criteria, Hicks & Company
recommends clearance for a total of 4.719 miles (67.59 acres) of proposed ROW
in properties where ROE was not granted (see Plates 1-15). Additional survey is
recommended for the remaining 15.989 miles (198.51 acres) of proposed ROW
where ROE was not granted (see Plates 1-15).
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit #4605. All project
related records and photos will be curated at TARL.

Scope of Work for
SH 349 Highway Improvement
From Two Miles North of Midland & Martin County Line to FM 2052 in Martin and
Dawson Counties, Texas
TxDOT Odessa District
CSJ#: 0380-07-018
This scope of work describes a 100% intensive linear pedestrian archeological
survey along the route of the proposed highway improvement to SH 349 in
Martin and Dawson Counties in west Texas (Figure 1). The proposed roadway
expansion would extend 42.5 miles from a point two miles north of the Midland
and Martin County line to the intersection of SH 349 and FM 2052 south of
Lamesa, Texas. The project is intended to improve the existing roadway in order
to develop SH 349 to Texas Trunk System Standards. The preferred alternative
proposes to improve the highway by expanding the current roadway into a four
lane divided highway through the addition of 100-110 feet of additional right-ofÂ­
way. Based on available schematics, the roadway will be built at grade or upon
fill in most places within the newly acquired right-of-way. In addition to the
expansion of the roadway, it is proposed to improve the interchange at the
junction of SH 349 and SH 176, and construct new bypasses around Patricia
and just south of Lamesa at FM 2052. At present four alternatives have been
proposed for the improvement of the SH 349/SH 176 interchange with six
proposed alternatives for the Patricia bypass. The proposed Lamesa bypass is
still under development.
Based on available construction schematics/plans the area of potential effects
(APE) comprises the entire footprint of the proposed roadway expansion in the
existing and newly acquired right-of-way (100-110 feet wide) and the areas of the
proposed interchange improvement and bypasses. Based on the available plans
the roadway will be built on grade, and the vertical extent of the APE appears
minimal throughout the project area. Final project profiles are not yet available,
however, based on projects of this type, it is estimated that the vertical APE will
typically extend only a few feet in depth.
The total SH 349 roadway
improvement project will consist of approximately 647 acres of new highway
right-of-way. The project will take place within the existing right-of-way and on
private land where right-of-entry has been acquired. As of June 26th, 2007,
approximately 61% of the landowners had granted right-of-entry for the
archeological survey.

The Hobbs and Big Spring Geologic Atlas of Texas maps indicate that the
underlying geology of the project area is made up of a combination of primarily
Holocene and Pleistocene deposits (Tahoka (Qta), Alluvium (Qal), Pond (Qun),
Caliche (Qcc), Windblown sand (Qcs)) and a very limited area of the
Miocene/Pliocene age Ogallala Formation. The SCS County Soil Surveys for
Martin and Dawson counties mapped twenty-one different soils (Table 1) within
the project area (Stoner and Dixon 1974, Sanders 1960). The most common are
soils mapped in the Slaughter-Kimbrough association and the Amarillo
association. Amarillo association soils are deep, nearly level to gently sloping,
loamy soils with a fine sandy loam surface layer and lower layers of sandy clay
loam. These soils are commonly cultivated. These soils are the most common
soil type within the project area north of the intersection of SH 349 and SH 176
in northern Martin County and all of Dawson County. Slaughter-Kimbrough
association soils are shallow to very shallow, nearly level to gently sloping, loamy
soils with a loam upper layer and a clay loam lower layer underlain by indurated
caliche 7 to 12 inches below the surface. These soils are commonly used for
rangeland and are the dominant soil type within the project area south of the
intersection of SH 349 with SH 176 in Martin County. Only in the vicinity of
Mustang Draw are other major soil associations traversed by the proposed SH
349 highway improvement. On either side of Mustang Draw are found a narrow
band of Potter-Mansker association soils. These are very shallow to deep, nearly
level to steep, loamy soils. The Potter-Mansker association soils are in turn
bounded on either side by Miles-Patricia association soils. These soils are deep,
nearly level to gently sloping, sandy soils. Overall, soils within the project area
range from 0-72 inches in depth and may have the potential for buried deposits.
However, the use of these soils for agricultural purposes and the presence of
urban landscapes within the project area mean there is a high potential for
surface disturbance within the project area (see attached aerial photos). In
addition, preexisting utility lines, wells, homes and businesses are present along
the project area, increasing the likelihood for disturbance to the soils and any
buried deposits that may be present.

According to records researched on the Texas Historical Commission Sites Atlas,
no previously recorded sites are present within the project area. Only one
previously conducted survey overlaps the project area in its southern extreme.
This areal survey was conducted for the FAA, and is bounded on its western
edge by SH 349. No cultural resources were identified in the course of that
survey. Another areal survey was conducted by the TNRCC approximately a
kilometer northeast of the northern project terminus. No sites were identified in
the course of this survey. Three sites â 41DS2, 41DS8, and 41MT11 â are
located within close proximity of the project area. Site 41DS8, located just
south of the TNRCC areal survey and approximately 940 meters northeast of the
northern project terminus, is the closest site. No information concerning the
site is available on THC Sites Atlas. Site 41DS2, the White Site, is a Late
Prehistoric bison kill site and possible camp site located 2380 meters east of the
project area at the edge of a playa. Recorded in a road cut in 1982, the site had
exposed bison bone, burned rock, and lithic tools including scrapers and a
Harrell and a Fresno point found in association. Additional bone was noted on
the surface in adjacent corn fields. No formal archeological investigations were
conducted at the time that it was recorded, but test excavations were
recommended to determine site potential. Finally, 41MT11 is approximately
2400 meters west of the project area on the east side of McKenzie Draw (Figure
1). The site was recorded by archeologists from the University of Texas and
consists of a surface scatter of burned rock and chert flakes that was seriously
disturbed as a result of plowing and natural erosion. Given the poor site
preservation, no further work was recommended for the site and it was
considered ineligible for NRHP/SAL listing.
Archeological research associated with the construction of the Sulpher Springs
Draw Reservoir (Quigg, et. al. 1994) and the Red Lake Reservoir (Quigg, et. al.
1993), both west of the project area, encountered multiple prehistoric and
historic archeological sites adjacent to draws and playas. Deposits were
generally limited to the surface, though several sites had deposits 10-30
centimeters in depth below surface. Only two sites exhibited greater depth:
41MT41 had material present to a depth of 60 centimeters below surface and
41MT21 had artifacts present to depths of over one meter. Prehistoric artifacts
consisted primarily of burned rock and caliche, lithic debitage and occasional
chipped or ground stone tools. Several sites also had historic components. In all
cases, regardless of depth of deposits, artifacts were visible on the surface.
In summary, examination of the USGS topographical quad maps, the Hobbs and
Big Spring Geologic Atlas of Texas maps, SCS County Soil Series maps, available
areal photographs, and known site distributions suggests that the possibility for
encountering archeological sites is relatively low except in areas where the
project crosses draws and playas. Over the course of the 42.5 mile length of the
project only one draw is crossed â Mustang Draw. In addition a second
ephemeral stream shown on the USGS topographical maps and eleven playas
are crossed or passed within close proximity. As the proposed project alignment
follows the existing roadway and passes through terrain that is currently used
for agricultural production as well as oil and gas extraction, and given the active

plowing of the fields, any sites in these areas will have lost much of their
integrity, if they have not been completely destroyed. In general, surface
visibility is expected to be good to very good along the project area depending on
surface vegetation.
The project area will be shovel tested at a rate of 16 shovel tests per linear mile
per 100 feet of width in areas with less than 30% surface visibility, in
accordance with the THCâs minimum standards for archeological survey. Shovel
tests will be excavated to a depth of one meter, to bedrock or to culturally sterile
soils, whichever is encountered first. Soil from all shovel tests will be screened
through Â¼â hardware mesh. Investigators will record their observations and the
results of shovel tests through notes, standardized shovel test forms, and
photographs. Any archeological sites identified during the survey will be
investigated by means of no fewer than six shovel tests in order to define site
boundaries relative to the project corridor. Artifacts encountered on the surface
or in the course of subsurface testing will not be collected, but will be fully photo
documented in the field.
In addition to shovel testing, backhoe trenching will be employed to investigate
for buried deposits on both sides of Mustang Draw. Backhoe trenching is also
proposed to test for deeply buried components of any sites encountered during
the survey that exhibit the possibility of possessing deposits at depths of greater
than one meter.
As per the THCâs Policy on Late-19th- and Early-20th-Century Sites (Denton
1999), any historical sites identified during the survey will be documented not
only through field efforts, but also through survey level archival research. This
research will include an attempt to determine the history of ownership and land
use for the site through oral interviews, deed research, or map research,
whenever possible. Census records for the names of the individuals associated
with the site will be checked, and the names of individuals will also be checked
in the New Handbook of Texas History. Based on a combination of archival
research, oral history, and artifact analysis, investigators will make
recommendations for further archival or archeological work (outside the current
scope) to determine NRHP/SAL eligibility.
All work will be conducted under the terms and conditions of the First Amended
Programmatic Agreement (2005) among the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), TxDOT, the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (TSHPO) and the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) and the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC.
The results of the investigation will be compiled into a professional report as
required under Chapter 26 of the THCâs Rules of Practice and Procedure and in
conformance with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (1966, as
amended). The report will discuss all sites identified, including identifying the
ownership of the land on which the site is located, and it will make
recommendations about their eligibility with respect to the National Historic
Preservation Act and as State Archeological Landmarks. The report will make
clear recommendations about the need for further testing of archeological sites.
The recommendations will be justified based on the requirements of 13 TAC
26.5(35) and 13 TAFC 26.20(2). This report will be submitted to TxDOT-ENV
and the THC for review and comment, and if required, Hicks & Company will
address all comments and resubmit the report for final approval.
All

archeological sites located during the survey will be recorded at TARL, and all
project photographs and records will be curated at that facility according to their
standards. Upon acceptance of the draft report by TxDOT-ENV and the THC, 25
bound color copies will be sent to TxDOT-ENV (20 for the THC to satisfy the
conditions of the permit) and two bound color hard copies to the Odessa
District.
