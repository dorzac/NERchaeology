Notes on Coahuiltecan Ethnography
RUDOLPH C. TROIKE

Prior to the nineteenth century, the area which today comprises
southern Texas and northeastern Mexico was inhabited by roving
bands of hunting-and-gathering Indians known collectively as
Coahuiltecans. The name "Coahuiltecan" was first used in a linguistic
sense by J. W. Powell ( 1891: 68) to refer to the related dialects
spoken throughout this area. He adapted the term from the designation "Coahuilteco" coined earlier by Orozco y Berra ( 1864) from the
state name of Coahuila, Mexico. There is no evidence, however, that
these groups of Indians ever considered themselves a single people.
On the contrary, the Spanish sources refer to numerous small bands
which bore distinct names and which were often at war with one
another.
The size and composition of these bands must have differed considerably, and probably even varied seasonally with changes in the
available food supply. The combination of a simple technology and a
harsh environment made it necessary for them to spend most of their
time in the quest for food. Except in summer, when plant foods were
abundant, starvation was an ever-present threat to these people.
Nevertheless, the adaptation of their culture to the environment was
sufficiently successful to permit a much higher concentration of population than is found in many parts of the same area today.
By 1800 the Coahuiltecans had virtually disappeared due to the
combined effects of war, disease, and acculturation. Our somewhat
meagre knowledge of their culture is derived principally from seventeenth and eighteenth century Spanish accounts. Most of the available
information on Coahuiltecan culture has been summarized and analyzed in a series of articles by Ruecking, ( 1953, 1954a, 1954b, 1955 ),
and a small amount of additional data from documentary sources has
been published recently (Troike, 1959). In general, ethnographic
references to the Coahuiltecans are so fragmentary and scarce that it
seems worthwhile to translate and publish them in order to make the
data more readily available.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

In 1749 Jose de Escandon established the first Spanish settlements
in the colony of Nuevo Santander (the present-day state of
Tamaulipas, Mexico ). He was accompanied on this colonizing expedition by Fray Simon del Hierro, who left a valuable diary covering the
activities of the expedition from December, 1748, to June, 1749
(Lejarza, 1947: 29*-57*; Archivo General de la Nacion, Mexico,
Ramo Historia, Torno 29, Exp. 20 ). Hierro mentions numerous encounters with groups of Indians throughout the territory, and occasionally gives information of ethnographic significance.
While Escandon's party was camped along the Soto la Marina River
east of the Sierra de Tamaulipas, a group of Indians came from the
Sierra to meet them. Hierro (Lejarza, 1947: 51 *) identifies them as
Pasitas Indians. He states (Lejarza, 1947: 32*; translation mine ) that
there were
about 150 tramp Indians, well armed, all strong, stout, and of similar
stature, about ZO years old and upwards. They came in peace, loaded with
squash, sweet potatoes, and beans, so that they provided food for all the
companies of settlers and soldiers for some time. After three days they
promised to return, and they returned loaded in the same fashion, so that
there were squash and beans to eat along much of the distance of the road
until the return to the north .

The Spaniards distributed gifts of clothing and trinkets to the Indians, but succeeded only in causing dissatisfaction among them because some Indians received more gifts than others. In addition to the
150 Pasitas who came the first time, Hierro states that more than 50
additional warriors remained behind as a rear guard.
The Pasitas Indians were evidently agricultural, as indicated by
the reference to squash, sweet potatoes, and beans, and the large number of warriors in the party which met Escandon. Hierro (Lejarza,
1947: 51 *) confirms this when he describes the Pasitas as the "best"
(most advanced?) and most numerous "nation" of Indians in the
colony, and states that "They sow much corn, squash, sweet potatoes,
and tobacco." This appears to be the northernmost occurrence of agriculture in Tamaulipas known from ethnographic sources. These ethnographic data correspond closely to the archeological evidence for the
northward extension of agriculture in the Sierra de Tamaulipas (MacNeish, 1958), and indicate that it was still being practiced at the time
of Spanish contact.
The only additional information on Pasitas culture in Hierro's account concerns an interesting ritual performed by the Pasitas leader to

COAHUILTECAN ETHNOGRAPHY

59

signalize peace between themselves and the Spanish (Lejarza, 1947,
32 *; translation mine).
The leader of these Indians, who was a captain, asked for a jar of water
and, beginning with the Colonel [Escandon], went about washing the
hands of all the captains and chiefs who were seated at the table. Afterward, gracefully taking off the breech-cloth which covered him between
his two legs, with it he went about cleaning the washed hands in sign of
peace. He washed and cleaned the hands of the Priest, who was also seated
at the table, and the top of his head as well. Indeed the admonition was
necessary not to laugh; as he did it with such seriousness, the same was
shown: but then and afterwards the joke was celebrated among those who
had been washed.

This unusual ceremony is somewhat reminiscent of the Caddo practice of washing the faces of visitors (Swanton, 1942: 178-181), though
the similarity may well be fortuitous. Culturally, the Pasitas must be
classified as a peripheral Mesoamerican group rather than as part of
the Coahuiltecan (or Western Gulf) area, because of their knowledge
of agriculture. Since they were the closest Mesoamerican group to the
Caddo area, further information on their culture and language would
be very desirable.
Along the route of the expedition Hierro records encounters with
various bands of Indians. During the journey from Barra de las Salinas (near San Fernando) to Camargo, the Spaniards followed the Rio
San Fernando and the Arroyo San Lorenzo (Lejarza, 1947: 36*-37*).
The party left Barra de las Salinas on April 25, following the river
upstream. On April 26 they encountered some Pintos Indians, who
guided them as far as the Sierra de los Pamonares, where they found a
camp of Pamonares Indians. These Indians guided them the next day,
until they came to a place with some pools of water, which they named
San Macario. Here they encountered a Boca Prieta Indian who seems
to have been a somewhat Hispanicized band leader. He led them as far
as the juncture of the river with the Arroyo San Lorenzo and thence
up the arroyo to the Charco de Ramirez.
From here on the Boca Prieta said that he did not know the road, because
these were now the lands of other different rancherias. They either did not
want to pass for fear of the other Indians, or b ecause each one observed
the boundaries of his lands. The same almost happened with the Pinto and
Pamorano [sic] Indians who served as guides the previous days. (Lejarza,
1947: 37*; translation mine.)

It is evident from this remark that the bands did observe some sort of
territorial boundaries, within which they carried on their nomadic
existence.
Hierro mentions the location of two Indian camps ( rancherias ) with
sufficient precision that it might be possible to locate the corresponding
archeological sites. Such a possibility would be significant for the development of historical archeology in the area. A camp of Pinto Indians was reported as being located on the Arroyo de las Chorreras
about three leagues from San Fernando, at a place where there was a
spring of good water. Escandon ordered that a mission should be established there for the Pintos (Lejarza, 1947: 39"'-40*). The second site
is stated to have been on the road from Santander (Jimenez ) to La
Barra, at a distance of four leagues (presumably from Santander),
where a very thick growth of tall royal palms was found around a
spring. The Indians were identified only by the name of their leader,
Santiago. An interesting reflection of Spanish influence beyond the
boundaries of actual settlement was revealed in the fact that a number
of the Indians in this band understood and spoke Spanish, albeit poorly
(Lejarza, 1947: 40* ).
Ruecking ( 1955: 377) notes only one reference to the taking of
heads of enemies killed in battle, and this instance occurred north of
the Rio Grande. The trait was also found in southern Tamaulipas,
however. While Escandon's party was at Horcasitas, word arrived
from Llera of a fight between the Spanish and the Janambre Indians.
The Janambres killed two Spaniards in the battle, then fled the field,
taking the heads with them and leaving the decapitated bodies behind
(Lejarza, 1947: 45*). Usually, however, the Indians of Tamaulipas
tried to carry off the entire bodies of enemies fallen in battle (Santa
Maria, c. 1795: 418 ).
Demographic data on Coahuiltecan groups are rather scarce; however, some population data are available for Indian groups living in or
near the missions of Nuevo Santander. The information given in two
reports, one written in 175 7 by Jose Tienda de Cuervo and the other in
1770 by Lino Nepomuceno Gomez (Cervantes, 1942 ), is summarized
in Table 1. Unfortunately, comparable figures are not available for
most groups, and those for which such figures are given (Pisones, Janambres ) are not properly Coahuiltecan groups. Additional data are
necessary before it will be possible to assess the impact of Spanish
colonization on the native population of this area.
Gabriel Saldivar (1943) has published the most complete map available to date showing the geographical location of the Coahuiltecan

bands in Tamaulipas. His map is undoubtedly a composite of information from various sources and does not indicate changes which may
have occurred from time to time. One discrepancy between the map
and the report by Nepomuceno Gomez may be noted in respect to the
Saulapahuemes, Taniacapemes, and Cotomanes (or Cotonames). Saldivar (1943: map) locates these bands on the south bank of the Rio
Grande, whereas in 1770 they are definitely stated to be "On the other
[i.e., north] side of the Rio Bravo del Norte, at a distance of about six
leagues .... " (Cervantes, 1942: 62). It is possible that the map is in
error, but it seems more likely that these bands simply moved from
one side of the river to the other at some time during the century. A
map or series of maps which would show the band locations at different times is needed in order to give a more accurate picture of Coahuiltecan geography.
