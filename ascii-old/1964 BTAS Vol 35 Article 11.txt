The Zavonian Springs Site: An ArchaicNeo-American Site in McGee Bend
Reservoir, San Augustine
County, Texas
W. A. DAVIS AND HELEN RUTH HORN
ABSTRACT
The Zavonian Springs Site, located in the McGee Bend Reservoir area in southeastern Texas, was excavated by members of the Sabine-Neches Archeological
Society from October 15, 1961 to October 14, 1962. "This work resulted in the recovery of one burial and 1,869 artifacts. An analysis of the vertical distribution of
the artifacts indicates that the site was occupied first by Archaic peoples and later
by Neo-American peoples. Within each of these major periods, several significant
changes in the material culture can be recognized. These are pointed out and compared with the findings made at other sites in the McGee Bend Reservoir area.

INTRODUCTION

The Zavonian Springs Site ( 41 SA 83) is located west of Indian
Creek and north of the Angelina River in San Augustine County,
Texas (Fig. 1) . It is within the McGee Bend Reservoir and near to the
Sawmill and Runnells (No. 1 and No. 2) sites, where salvage excavations were carried out by the National Park Service in 1957 (Tunnell, 1961: 123). Nearby springs (and, in turn, the site) derive their
name from a group of migratory people who passed through this area
in late 1800's and early 1900's. The true nationality of these people is
unknown, but they are assumed to have been of Slavic origin and are
referred to locally as the "Zavonians."
Excavation of the Zavonian Springs Site was carried out largely on
week ends during the fall of 1961 and throughout most of 1962, under
the sponsorship of the Sabine-Neches Archeological Society. The
major part of the work was accomplished by the Oscar Horn family
(Oscar, Helen, Sandra, Neil, and Patti ), although the site was frequently visited by W. A . (Bill) and Nita Davis.
Others who assisted in various phases of the work, and to whom the
authors are indebted include: J . Dan Scurlock, then of the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project, who provided invaluable aid in staking

DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA

McGee Bend Reservoir (soon to be known as Lake Sam Rayburn )
lies within the Eastern Timber Region of the Gulf Coastal Plain
Physiographic Province (Atwood, 1940: 25) . The major stream in the
immediate area is the Angelina River, which flows in southeasterly
direction until it turns abruptly to the south and joins the Neches
River. The Angelina flood plain is relatively broad (as much as one to
two miles across) and flat, but the adjacent uplands-made up of rolling, sand-capped clay ridges-sometimes reach an elevation of 200 to
250 feet above mean sea level. Dominant geologic formations are the
sands and clays of the Eocene Jackson group ( Sellards, et al., 1932:
677-699 ) .
The average annual rainfall is between 40 and 60 inches, and the
climate in general can be characterized as moist and subtropical.
These conditions make the region ideal for large forests. The uplands
are covered with varieties of pine and hardwood, typical of hill country, while the bottomlands contain oak, beech, ash, magnolia, gum,
cypress, and less commonly, loblolly pine. Both the flora and the fauna
are typical of the Austroriparian Biotic Province (Blair, 1950: 98100 ).
Very little agriculture is being carried on at present, though at one
time it was widespread. Today the main source of livelihood is provided by forest products and livestock.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

With the exception of a brief reconnaissance made by Gus E.
Arnold in 1939-1940 for The University of Texas-W. P . A. , the
archeology of this part of the state is known primarily from salvage
work carried out by the Smithsonian Institution ( Stephenson, 1948 ),
by the National Park Service (Tunnell, 1961 ), and by the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project (Duffield, 1963 ). The salvage investigations were initiated in 1948 when Robert L. Stephenson, working
out of the Austin office of the River Basin Surveys, Smithsonian Instition, made an extensive survey of the area to be effected by the McGee
Bend Reservoir. Then in 1956 and 1957, National Park Service crews,
under the direction of Edward B. Jelks, undertook excavations at nine

216

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

of the McGee Bend sites (Tunnell, 1961 ) . Finally, in 1960 and again
in 1962, the Texas Archeological Salvage Project, The University of
Texas, carried out excavations at five additional sites.
Much of the McGee Bend material is still being analyzed by Jelks
(personal communication ), although Duffield ( 1963 ) has published
the findings made at the Wolfshead Site, and Tunnell ( 1961 ) has
reported, in part, on the Runnells Site No. 1, Runnells Site No.2, and
the Sawmill Site. Both Tunnell and Duffield have presented data
which help to establish a basic chronology and which indicate that
the major cultural affiliations lie to the north, with Caddoan area
cultures, and to the south, with an undefined Archaic complex (or
complexes ) and the Galveston Bay Focus.
Excavations at the Zavonian Springs Site recovered cultural materials that indicate the presence of Archaic and Neo-American occupations. The Neo-American ceramics tended to occur more commonly
in the upper levels, and are indicative of affiliation with both the Gibson and Fulton aspects. The lower levels of the site, on the other hand,
give evidence of Archaic occupations that cannot be satisfactorily
identified with previously defined Archaic complexes in eastern Texas.
The Archaic remains at the Zavonian Springs Site, however, are similar to those reported by Tunnell and Duffield.
THE SITE
DESCRIPTION

The Zavonian Spring Site lies buried in a sand-capped clay ridge
at the northeastern edge of the Angelina River flood plain. Several
springs are located just south of the site and Indian Creek passes to
the north and east (Fig. 1) . A considerable portion of the artifactbearing deposits have been removed in clearing for road construction
and for obtaining fill dirt. On the western side of the road (Figs. 1, 2 ),
recent cultivation has caused a fair amount of damage, while to the
east disturbances from an old sawmill are visible. However , the area
near the former sawmill seemed less disturbed and the soil appeared
midden-like; it was in this portion of the site that the excavations
described below w ere carried out.
ExcAvATION

Work was initiated by placing a stake, designated as N500-E500,
at what was believed to be the southeastern edge of the site. From

217

ZA VONIAN SPRINGS SITE

this stake, squares and trenches of various sizes were laid out by means
of triangulation. Due to the horizontal extent of the site, and the limited time and personnel available for excavation, no detailed grid was
staked out; rather, the squares and trenches were set up only as they
were required (Fig. 2).

Vertical control was maintained by establishing a datum point at
an assumed elevation of 100 feet (Fig. 2), and by digging in arbitrary levels which varied from six inches to two feet in thickness. The
rich sandy loam made excavation relatively easy, but the depth of the
site proved to be a problem. We were especially eager to sample the
Archaic remains, but these generally occurred at depths varying
from 2.5 to 4.5 feet below the surface. Thus, after a number of squares
and trenches had been carefully dug and the deposit screened (usually
through a half-inch mesh), attempts were made to hasten the excavations. This was accomplished by 1) not using screens, and 2 ) by having Mr. Chester Norris use a front-end loader to cut three trenches
( 7.5 feet wide and from 60 to 102 feet long) across the site (Fig. 2) .
Because of obstructions such as trees and line poles these trenches
could not always be oriented in the cardinal directions. Each trench
was carefully bladed down in 0.25 foot levels, usually to a depth of
2.5 feet below the surface. Their main purpose was to sample more
of the site before extensive damage was done by pothunters.
During the course of the investigations, field notes were kept and
a contour map was constructed (Fig. 2). In addition, the walls vvere
frequently cleaned, profiles drawn, and the floors of the excavations
carefully checked for possible occupational features .
STRATIGRAPHY

Exclusive of the spoil dirt overburden encountered near the road
construction (Figs. 2 and 3), there were five lithologically distinct
zones found throughout the site. There are (numbered from top to
bottom):
Zone V: This, the uppermost zone, consisted of a gray-brown sand with numerous grass roots and other organic matter. It generally extended from the surface
to a depth of between 0.2 and 0.4 foot below the surface. Zone V was devoid of
aboriginal cultural refuse, but did contain some modern debris.
Zone IV: The matrix of this zone was a uniform medium brown sand which
contained flecks of charcoal, many small scraps of bone, and considerable evidence
of rodent disturbance. Contact with the underlying Zone III was irregular, but
clearly distinguished by a thin band of reddish-brown, sandy-clay, the origin of
which is unknown. Zone IV varied in thickness from 1 to 1.5 feet. The upper
portion contained modem objects, while the lower portion had Neo-American
materials.
Zone I II: Consisting of a medium brown, mottled sand, this zone was somewhat
lighter in color than Zone IV. There were signs of some rodent activity, largely
in the upper parts of the zone. Reddish-brown, sandy-clay bands-very similar
to the one described above-occurred in the lower portion of Zone III, and some-

times at the level of contact with Zone II. Zone III varied from 1.0 to Z.O feet in
thickness, and it yielded both Archaic and Nee-American materials.
Zone I!: This zone was made up of a pale, mottled sand which contained
numerous bands of sandy-clay. It tended to become slightly lighter in color as
more depth was obtained. The thickness varied in different parts of the site, with
a maximum range of 1.5 to Z.5 feet. Zone II produced only Archaic artifacts.
Zone !: The excavations terminated in the upper part of this zone, a relatively
dense, yellow-orange, sandy-clay. The thickness of Zone I was not determined,
for none of the excavations extended more than five feet below the surface. The
little cultural refuse obtained from this zone is probably intrusive from the lower
part of Zone II.

220

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Largely because of variations in the thickness of each zone, it has
been impossible to relate the arbitrary excavation levels to the abovedescribed zones. The artifact distributions and analysis of the site as
a whole, has consequently been in terms of the excavation levels (see
Table 1) .
BURIAL

The one burial recovered from the site consists of a poorly and incompletely preserved skeleton of an adult, probably representing a
male. The lower limb bones were first encountered during the cleaning of the southeastern wall of Test Trench No. 2; additional excavations in two contiguous squares exposed the remainder of the burial
(Fig. 2 ) . The skeleton was full y extended in a supine position, with
the head to the southeast and the feet to the northwest. The skull was
tilted and faced the north.
Despite careful trowelling, no grave outline could be observed:
the skeleton was found lying in a m edium brown, mottled sand (Zone
III ), with no visible change from the surrounding matrix. A large ant
colon y h ad somewhat disturbed the area about the burial, and made
exposure of the bones tedious and uncomfortable. The top of the skull
was 1.61 feet below the surface (9 7.59 elevation), while the lower
limb bones were first exposed at 1.94 feet below the surface (97. 15
elevation ) .
There was no evidence of offerings, but cultural refuse-presumably inadvertently included in the grave fill-was found about the
burial, especially adjacent to the hip and lower extremities. Artifacts
from the two squ ares excavated during recovery of the burial have
been listed separately in Table 1.
DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS

The 1,869 artifacts recovered from the Zavonian Springs Site have
been broadly grouped according to the materials from which they were
manufactured: clay, stone, and bone. Within these general categories
a number of presumed functional groups have been distinguished,
including pottery, dart points, arrow points, scrapers, knives, drills,
etc. Each of these functional groups has, in turn, been further divided,
and sometimes even subdivided, into morphologically similar categories (such as engraved, clay-tempered pottery) . Whenever possible,
the resultant groups have been identified with an already established
typology. For the most part, the types defined by Suhm, Krieger, and

221

ZA VON IAN SPRINGS SITE

Jelks ( 1954), by Bell ( 1958; 1960), and by Tunnell ( 1961 ) have been
employed. The sections which follow are devoted to detailed descriptions of the most discrete groups recognized. Provenience data are
presented in Table 1 and are briefly discussed in a later portion of the
paper.
ARTIFACTS OF CLAY

Objects of baked clay number 1427 and are by far the most common
class of artifacts found at the Zavonian Springs Site. Included are 1,048
clay-tempered potsherds, 229 sand-tempered potsherds, a pipe bowl
fragment, a possible vessel effigy fragment, and 148 pieces of baked
clay.

Clay-Tempered Pottery
Clay, sometimes combined with grit, bone, and pulverized sherds,
is the dominant tempering agent in 1,048 sherds. Of these, 541 are
plain and 507 are decorated.
PLAIN SHERDS

Included in this category are 46 sherds from jar and bowl rims, three
sherds from bottle necks, 36 sherds from bases, and 456 sherds from
various body sections. Most are probably from the lower portions of
decorated vessels and plain, undecorated pottery as such was clearly
rare or perhaps even absent. Three of the plain sherds have a red or
orangish slip.
The plain sherds vary in texture from fine and compact to coarse
and crumbly, with the majority being moderately fine. Surface colors
range from cream to buff, and from gray to black and chocolate brown.
Cores are generally darker than the surfaces, but occasionally no sharp
color differentiation can be observed. Both the interior and exterior
surfaces show a considerable variation in the degree of finishing, from
rough to polished. The wall thickness falls between 3 and 9 mm.
The range of rim profiles is shown in Fig. 7 (G-N, W) , with most
being turned out or vertical and rounded or flattened lips. The most
unusual sherd (Fig. 7, W) is abruptly everted and reminiscent of the
rims sometimes found on Belcher Ridged (Webb, 1959: 136, Fig. 114 ).
Several of the rim sherds have small perforations, possibly cracklacing or suspension holes. All of the larger base sherds suggest that
the bottoms were flat, and definite indications of convex-based vessels
are lacking.

DE CORATED SH ERDS

Almost 50 percent of the clay-tempered pottery found at the site is
decorated. Techniques represented are those widely distributed in
eastern Texas : engraving, incising, punctating, brushing, pinching,

ZA VONIAN SPRINGS SITE

223

appliqueing, and various combinations of these. Design elements and
layouts are, in general, very similar to comparable features on Gibson
and Fulton Aspect pottery. In spite of these obvious ceramic relationships with Caddoan area, the typological identification of the pottery
from the Zavonian Springs Site poses certain problems. Types described
by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks ( 1954) are similar to the locally-made
pottery, yet are sufficiently different to make direct correlation impossible. Thus, in the descriptions which follow, none of the sherds
has been assigned to a specific type, although resemblances to appropriate Caddoan ceramics are noted.
Engraved. Of the 507 decorated sherds, 44 bear engraved designs.
Seven of these are from rim sherds, one from a bottle neck, and 37
are from body areas (one having red pigment in the engraved lines ) .
While the temper is predominately clay or clay -grit, 10 sherds also
have pulverized sherds and/ or bone particles. Interior surfaces vary
from poorly smoothed to polished, with ripple marks left by smoothing
implements being visible in several instances. Exterior surfaces are
generally better finished, varying from well smoothed to highly
polished. The surface colors are from tan to dark brown, while the
cores are from gray to gray-brown. Wall thickness ranges from 4 to
7mm.
Five of the engraved sherds have scroll designs with crosshatched
fields enclosing the scrolls (Fig. 4, A)-a decorative technique somewhat reminiscent of type Ripley Engraved (Suhm, et al. , 1954: 346,
Pl. 57, L ) . An additional six sherds have vertically engraved lines
which are stepped off with horizontal lines and crosshatched fields
(Fig. 4, B) . This design compares most favorably with that occasionally
found on bottles of Poynor Engraved (Suhm, et al., 1954: 342, Pl. 56,
F ). The remaining 33 sherds have various engraved lines and crosshatched areas, but are generally too small to determine the design
layout. Included are four rim sherds which appear to have come from
carinated bowls. The lip-rim area on these specimens is either tapered
and rounded, or vertical and flattened (including one which rises to
form a peak ) . A fifth rim sherd (Fig. 4, C, C' ) is rolled outward and
has a slightly flattened lip. It has a good polish on both surfaces, with
a single horizontal line approximately 5 mm. below the lip. In some
respects, this rim sherd is similar to those found on Ripley Engraved
vessels.
·
Incised. This category is represented by 71 sherds, 11 of which are
from rims, and one from a bottle neck. In addition to the clay-grit
temper, 10 specimens contain pulverized sherds, 26 have finely ground

224

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

bone, and several have traces of an unidentified carbonized material.
Surfaces are generally smoothed, but only rarely well polished. The
texture varies from medium-coarse and firm to coarse and crumbly,
while the surface colors range from buff and orange-red to a dark
gray-brown. Cores are gray to black, or practically the same shade as
the surfaces. Wall thickness is from 4 to 9 mm.
The incised decorations consist largely of vertical, horizontal, and
diagonal lines with no distinguishing patterns. Eleven sherds (Figs. 4,
D , E and 5, A), however, have diagonal crosshatched designs similar
to those found on Maydelle Incised ; two sherds (Fig. 4, F, G) with
vertical lines intersected by diagonal lines are reminiscent of Pease
Brushed-Incised; and three sherds with circles sometimes flanked by
inclined bands (Fig. 4, H , I) suggest Crockett Curvilinear Incised.
Since many of the sherds are small, very little can be determined
about vessel shape. Rims generally vary from straight to moderately
outflaring; the lips are usually flattened or rounded, the latter sometimes having an exterior flange.

Punctated-Incised. Forty-one sherds have incised lines combined
with stick puntations. All are clay-grit tempered, but 14 have, in
addition, pulverized bone and four have crushed sherds. Texture
ranges from compact to, in a few specimens, crumbly. Considerable
variation can be seen in the surface finish, from poorly to well
smoothed. Surface colors range from cream to chocolate brown; cores
are usually a bit darker.
The more distinctive designs (on 18 sherds ) consist of stick punctations, arranged into curvilinear or triangular patterns (Fig. 5, B, C,
E-G) which are generally similar to types Crockett Curvilinear Incised
(Suhm, et al., 1954: 262, Pls. 14-16) and Pennington PunctatedI ncised ( Suhm, et al., 1954: 340, Pl. 54) . The remaining 23 sherds are
too small to recognize distinctive designs. Punctations on all examples
have been made with sharply pointed (Fig. 5, B, G ) or blunt (Fig. 5,
C, E, F ) tools.
Punctated. There are 73 sherds from the site decorated with random
punctations which have been produced by the fingernail or, less often,
a pointed or blunted instrument. Clay-grit is the major tempering
agent, with some bone and/ or crushed sherds appearing in 18 sherds.
In addition, eight specimens have traces of unidentified carbonized
materials-probably accidental inclusions in the clay which burned
during firing. The paste ranges from fine and compact to medium
coarse, but is not crumbly. Interiors are poorly smoothed to polished,

while the exteriors are roughened over-all with punctations. Surface
colors range from cream to dark brown or black; cores are the same or
somewhat darker. Wall thickness is between 3 and 8 mm. The 17 rim

ZA VONIAN SPRINGS SITE

227

sherds are vertical or turned outward, with simple rounded lips (Fig.
6,D) orevertedandroundedlips (Fig. 6,E).

Brushed. Represented by 225 sherds, brushing is the most common
decorative technique found at the site. In addition to the clay-grit
temper, 78 of the brushed sherds have pulverized bone and 14 have
crushed sherds. The texture is often rather coarse, with a number of
specimens containing distinct lumps of clay and small pieces of carbonized material. Interior surfaces are poorly to well smoothed, and
the exterior surfaces are roughened by brushing. Surface colors -r ange
from buff to gray and chocolate brown. Wall thickness is from 4 to
9mm.
The brushing varies from vertical (Fig. 6, G) or horizontal to
diagonal, as well as various combinations of these (Fig. 6, F ) . On some
specimens it is deep and poorly executed; on others, it is faint and
well spaced, almost as if the surface has been "combed."
The 19 sherds from vessel rims indicate that the rim-lip area was
flared out and rounded, or vertical and flattened. Three of the body
sherds contain perforations, probably crack-lacing holes.
Brushed-Punctated. There are 35 brushed-punctated sherds, seven
of which are from vessel rims. In addition to the clay or clay-grit
temper, seven sherds contain pulverized bone and two have crushed
sherds. Texture is from fine and compact to coarse. Interior surfaces
are smoothed, but not polished; the exteriors are covered with brush
marks and punctations. The surface colors vary from buff to orange
and chocolate brown, while the cores are gray or slightly darker than
the surfaces. Wall thickness is from 4 to 7 mm., and the rim-lip area
is uniformly outcurved and rounded (Fig. 7, A' ).
Six of the sherds having neat horizontal brushing and small stick
punctation (Fig. 7, A ) are similar to type Pease Brushed-Incised. A
seventh specimen (Fig. 7, B) is somewhat reminiscent of Maydelle
Incised, in that it displays random brushing with a small field of
punctations set off by a horizontal row of larger, but shallower, punctations. The remaining 28 sherds are nondescript and too small (Fig.
7, C) to compare with established types.
Pinched. The six specimens in this category appear to have come
from two vessels. In each case, the exterior surface is covered with
horizontally or vertically pinched ridges and fingernail impressions
which have been somewhat smoothed over (Fig. 7, D, E). The interior
surfaces are smoothed and black, while the exterior surfaces are buff

with some fire-mottling. Texture is coarse, but firm. Wall thickness
is uniformily 8 mm.

Appliqued. Twelve body sherds are decorated with vertical, appliqued fillets which seem to separate panels of brushed or incised lines,
much like the lower portions of Pease Brushed-Incised vessels. In
addition, punctations sometimes appear on the fillets and other parts
of the body (Fig. 7, F ). Surface colors are from orange to brown and
chocolate brown, while the cores are usually a bit darker. Texture is
medium fine and compact. Interior surfaces are smoothed and the
exterior ones are covered, or nearly covered, with decoration.
Sand-Tempered Pottery
Sand, with no other visible tempering agent, appears in the paste of
229 sherds from the Zavonian Spring Site. Of these, 220 are plain
and nine are decorated.
PLAIN SHERDS

The undecorated sand-tempered specimens include 19 rim sherds,
one basal sherd, and 200 body sherdsli; two of which have crack-lacing
holes. Texture is generally fine, although on some specimens the surfaces are so sandy that they feel much like sandstone. On others, the
surfaces are well smoothed and relatively firm . Surface colors range
from gray to brown and buff to chocolate brown. Cores are slightly,
but consistently, darker. The major vessel form appears to have been a
cylindrical jar with straight or slightly convex sides. The range of rim
profiles is shown in Fig. 7 (0-V).
In general characteristics, the plain, sand-tempered pottery bears
relationships with Goose Creek Plain, a major type of the Galveston
Bay Focus.
DECORATED SHERDS

Only a limited number (nine ) of the sand-tempered sherds-unlike
the clay-tempered ones-are decorated. Four of these have broad,
incised or trailed lines made with a blunt tool (Fig. 5, D ). Each of the
remaining five specimens has a horizontal, trailed line separating one
to two rows of punctations from diagonal or semi-circular, trailed lines
(Fig. 6, A-C). The punctations are typically hemispherical in shape,
having been made by pressing a stick at an angle against the plastic
clay. Although only one rim sherd (Fig. 6, A, A') was recovered, it
is clear that the decoration was confined to the upper portion of the

230

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

vessels. In general treatment and design layout, these sherds are similar to Goose Creek Incised.

Miscellaneous Ceramic Objects
PIPE

A fragment of an undecorated pipe bowl has clay-grit temper and
a medium fine texture. The exterior wall is vertical, terminating in a
fl<;~t lip; while the exterior surface is polished and dark tan in color
with some fire-mottling. The interior wall slopes inward toward the
base and is not as well finished- as the exterior. Reconstructed, the
outside diameter at the rim was 33 mm. The concavity of the bowl
was about 18 mm. in diameter at the rim, tapering to 11 mm. at the
base, and a maximum of 13 mm. deep.
EFFIGY

A small, roughly cylindrical object of baked clay may represent a
piece broken off an effigy vessel. It is tempered with clay-grit, and the
surface color ranges from light gray to black. Incomplete, this specimen now measures 33 mm. long and 8.5 mm. in diameter.
BAKED CLAY

One hundred and forty-eight, irregularly-shaped lumps of baked
clay (sometimes containing considerable quantities of sand ) were
recovered from the site. Approximately one-third of these have reed
or grass impressions and are presumably fragments of wattle-impressed
daub. The presence of these pieces of daub suggests the existence of
structures at the site, although none was recognized during excavation.
Significantly, the wattle-impressed daub was most common in the
second (0.5 to 1.0 foot ) excavation level.
ARTIFACTS OF STONE

The 329 lithic specimens from the Zavonian Springs Site include
a gorget, arrow points, dart points, knives, drills, scrapers, gravers,
choppers, hammerstones, milling slabs, a pitted stone, cores, smoothed
and pecked stones, and pieces of ocher. Most were manufactured from
locally-obtained materials (cherts, petrified wood, and sandstone); the
only specimens made from foreign materials being the gorget, one
dart point, two knife fragments, and several flint flakes.

ZAVONIAN SPRINGS SITE

231

Polished Stone
GORGET

A nearly complete gorget has been fashioned from a hard and finegrained, black stone. It is highly polished, has an ovoid outline and
two, biconically-drilled holes (Fig. 8, A, A'). Small, irregularlyspaced notches have been cut into the upper and lower marginal
edges. The reconstructed length of the gorget is estimated at 105 mm.;
the maximum width occurs midway between the holes and is 57
mm.; the maximum thickness is 7 mm. The suspension holes have
been placed along the long axis of the gorget, 48 mm. apart from one
another.
Recovered in situ, the gorget was found at N555-E495.8, at a depth
of three feet below the surface. However, approximately two feet of
the overburden had been formed by the log deck or skidway of the
old sawmill.

Chipped Stone
ARROW POINTS

Thirty-five small, chipped stone specimens with distinct stems have
been classified as arrow points. Five of these are too fragmentary for
further description, while the remainder have been sorted into the
four types (Alba, Cliffton, Friley, and Perdiz) briefly described below.

Alba. This type is represented by four points, each of which has a
triangular blade with straight lateral edges (Fig. 8, B, C). The shoulders are at right angles to the stem and are prominent, bnt not barbed.
The lateral edges of the stem are straight, while the base varies from
straight to mildly convex. Length ranges from 16 to 23 mm., and the
width at the shoulders from 16 to 20 mm.
Cliffton. Each of the three arrow points identified as Cliffton has
been crudely chipped from a small flake. The one complete example
(Fig. 8, D) has an asymmetrical blade, one edge of which is concave,
the other straight and faintly serrated. This specimen is 23 mm. long
and 15 mm. wide at the shoulders; the two remaining points are too
fragmentary for meaningful measurement.
Friley. Nine points with rectangular or slightly expanding stems are
classified as Friley (Fig. 8, E-G) . Their most distinctive features, however, are the upturn or reversed barbs. As a group, these points are thin

and well made. The bases are rather variable, ranging from straight or
convex, to concave. The length is from 17 to 24 mm., while the width
at the shoulders is from 10 to 18 mm.
One of the Friley points was found in place at N588.5-E477.5 , 2.5
feet below the surface, and about one foot from the burial. Because of

ZA VONIAN SPRINGS SITE

233

its distance from the skeleton, it seems unlikely that it was intended
as an offering.

Perdiz. Represented by 14 specimens, Perdiz is the most common
arrow point type found at the site. The blades are triangular with
straight, concave, or slightly convex lateral edges which are sometimes serrated (Fig. 8, H-K). The shoulders may extend outward at
right angles to the stem or have downward projecting barbs, while the
stems contract to rounded or pointed bases. All are made from locallyobtained cherts and petrified wood, and the workmanship, on the
whole, is good. Lengths range from 24 to 34 mm. , width (at the shoulders) from 15 to 22 mm.
DART POINTS

The 64 specimens identified as dart points are differentiated from
the arrow points primarily on the basis of their larger size. Twentynine of these are grouped into 10 types, and 35 cannot be identified
with any established type, largely because of their fragmentary condition.

Desmuke. A small, roughly lozenge-shaped dart point (Fig. 9, B)
appears to fit the Desmuke type, although it could conceivably be an
aberrant form of Gary. It has slightly convex blade edges which are
alternately beveled to the right. The stem contracts to form an essentially pointed base. Workmanship is crude, probably because of
the quality of the petrified wood used. The length is 32 mm.; width
across the shoulders 16 mm.
Ellis. There are two expanded stem dart points (Fig. 9, C, D) which
fall within the range of variation of the Ellis type. Distinctive features include a triangular blade with slightly convex edges and prominent, but unbarbed shoulders, and an expanded stem with a straight
base. These specimens are 36 and 38 mm. long, 21 and 26 mm. wide
at the shoulders, respectively.
Ensor. Only one of the dart points from the Zavonian Springs Site
appears to be of the Ensor type. It (Fig. 9, E) has deep side-notches
and a long, leaf-shaped blade. The stem is short and only slightly narrower than the shoulders. Workmanship is only fair, most of the
point has been crudely fashioned by the removal of percussion flakes.
The lateral edges of the blade, however, have been retouched by
evenly-spaced pressure flakes. The specimen is 68 mm. long, 22 mm.
wide at the shoulders, and 18 mm. wide at the base.

234

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Epps. A rather crudely made point of petrified wood (Fig. 9, F) ,
agrees very favorably with Ford and Webb's (1956: 58, Fig. 20, CG) definition of the Epps type. The blade is slender and triangular,
with mildly convex edges; the stem is expanded and has a convex
base. Incomplete, the length is estimated to have been about 60 mm. ;
width across the shoulders is 20 mm. , and across the base 15 mm.

Gary. The eight Gary dart points from the site have triangular
blades with slightly convex or concave blade edges. Shoulders are
distinct, but not prominent, and the stems contract to form rounded
bases. However, in size and quality of workmanship, these points
exhibit a considerable range of variation (see, for example, the illustrated specimens, Fig. 9, G-I ). The lengths vary from 27 to 48 mm. ,
the widths at the shoulders from 19 to 27 mm.

Kent. Eleven dart points correspond, in part, with the description
given for the Kent ty pe ( Suhm, et al. , 1954: 432, Pl. 95) , and for
" Type I" (Tunnell, 1961 : 127, Fig. 2 ). They are somewhat arbitrarily
and, certainly only provisionally, classified as Kent.
The blades are roughly triangular in outline and usually have well
developed, but unbarbed, shoulders (Fig. 9, J-L ) . Stems display a considerable range, varying from parallel-sided to expanded, to slightly
contracted. The bases are either straight or mildly convex, with some
retaining the original nodular cortex. Crude flaking is common on
these points, and the cross sections are often fairly thick. The lengths
range from 26 to 40 mm., the width across the shoulders from 19 to
27mm.
Lange. Each of the two dart points identified as Lange has a large
triangular blade with straight edges and prominent shoulders (Fig.
9, M ) . The stem is slightly expanded, while the base is mildly convex.
Both points have been made from a poor grade of petrified wood and
the flake scars are irregular. The total lengths are 52 and 72 mm. ,
width at shoulders 26 and 28 mm., the stem length is 16 mm. (both
specimens) , and widths at the base are 16 and 18 mm.
Palmillas. A crudely made specimen (Fig. 10, A) of reddish-brown
chert falls within the range of variation of the Palmillas type ( Suhm,
et al. 1954: 462, Pl. 110 ) . It has a leaf-shaped blade with convex lateral edges and very poorly developed shoulders. The stem is small and
expanded with a convex base. The length is 46 mm. and the width at
the shoulders is 15 mm.
Pedernales. This type is represented at the site by a dart point (Fig.

ZA VON IAN SPRINGS SITE

235

10, B) which has a short, triangular blade and an essentially rectangular stem with a notched base. Lateral edges of the stem are
slightly constricted at the base, and the base has been thinned by the
removal of one large longitudinal flake on one side and two on the
opposing side. The shoulders are pronounced, but lack barbs. Flaking
is generally crude and appears to have been by the hammerstone
percussion technique, although some evidence of secondary pressure
chipping appears along the lateral edges. The distal end of this point
is missing, but it is estimated to have originally been approximately
51 mm. long. The width across the shoulders is 24 mm., and the length
of the stem is 23 mm.

Yarbrough. One point (Fig. 10, C) with a more or less parallel-sided
stem is classified as the Yarbrough type. Made from a pink and yellow
chert, it has a small and slender, triangular blade with slightly convex
edges and rather weak shoulders. The base of the stem is straight, and
both the stem edges and the base have been smoothed. This specimen is
45 mm. long, 21 mm. wide at the shoulders, and 15 mm. wide at the
base of the stem.
Unidentified and Fragmentary Dart Points. Included in this category are two complete, but untyped dart points, and 33 unclassifiable
fragments of dart points. One of the untyped specimens (Fig. 9, A)
does not have a clearly off-set stem, although the lateral edges of the
blade do recurve near the base. Except for its small size (54 mm. in
length and 20 mm. in maximum width), it resembles a Copena knife
(Newell and Krieger, 1949: 173-174, Fig. 60, A-H); indeed, it could
be a diminutive form of that type. The surface of this specimen has
been damaged by heat, but it appears to have originally been rather
thin and well made.
The second untyped point (Fig. 10, D) has a large, leaf-shaped
blade and a short, contracting stem. Lateral edges of the blade are convex and the base of the stem is faintly concave. Perhaps because it is
made from a coarse-grained petrified wood, the workmanship is very
poor. This specimen measures 58 mm. in length, 27 mm. in width at
the shoulders, and 16 mm. in width at the base.
None of the 33 fragmentary specimens is complete enough for identification. Specifically, they include 16 distal end pieces, 10 fragments from proximal ends, and seven medial sections.
KNIVES

Including fragmentary and unclassifiable pieces, 130 knives were
recovered from the Zavonian Springs Site. As a group, they are

crudely made from petrified wood and chert, with much of the hifacial chipping being confined to the marginal edges. Most of the 90
complete or nearly complete specimens can be identified with three of

ZAVONIAN SPRINGS SITE

237

the five provisional blade types recognized by Tunnell (1961: 129133, Figs. 5 and 6 ) .

Type I. Each of the eight specimens comprising this group has been
made from a long, thin rectanguloid slab of pertified wood (Fig. 10, E).
Only one lateral edge has been worked and, on some examples, one
end is altered. The cutting edges vary from straight to convex, having
been shaped by removal of fairly large, randomly-spaced percussion
flakes. The length ranges from 49 to 63 mm., the width from 27 to
39 mm., and the maximum thickness from 6 to 7 mm.
Type II. This type is represented by 18 knives having trianguloid
outlines and unaltered bases which sometimes retain the natural cortex of the stone (Fig. 10, F ) . Most are fashioned from thin slabs of
petrified wood, although a few, generally better made specimens, are
of chert. The lateral edges of the blade vary from straight to convex,
to concave. Some have fairly sharp tips, but most are rounded, while
the bases are consistently straight. The length ranges from 60 to 80
mm., width at the base (usually the widest part of the knife ) from 32
to 44 mm., maximum thickness from 6 to 11 mm.
T y pe III. Represented by 47 specimens, this is by far the most
common knife type found at the site (Fig. 10, G ). Type III knives are
bifacially worked blades with ovoid to (more often ) triangular outlines. Both the base and the lateral edges vary from straight to convex.
While flaking is usually rough with no evidence of pressure retouching, these knives are often better made and smaller, than those of
Type II. The length ranges from 28 to 73 mm., the maximum width
from 24 to 25 mm., and the maximum thickness from 6 to 22 mm.
Miscellaneous. There are 17 specimens which are complete, or reasonably so, but which do not readily agree with the categories established by Tunnell. Moreover, there is so much individual variation that
they cannot satisfactorily be sorted into meaningful descriptive groups.
The outline varies and the workmanship is generall poor. Lengths
range from 26 to 92 mm., maximum width from 22 to 44 mm., and
maximum thickness from 5 to 22 mm.
Fragmentary. Forty pieces of knives, including distal, proximal,
and medial sections, are too fragmentary to classify into finer groups.
It might be noted, however, that two appear to have been made from
foreign stones. One is of a fine grained, olive-drab colored stone, while
the other is of a cream colored quartzite.

DRILLS

There are seven long, slender chipped stone artifacts classified as
drills. Five of these are identifiable as Tunnell's Type I ( 1961: 139,
Fig. 4, L, M), and two as his Type II (Ibid. , Fig. 4, P, Q) . The Type
I drills are also similar to those described for the Jake Martin Site
(DavisandDavis, 1960: 114,Fig.14,A,B).

Type I. All examples included in this group are bifacially worked,
have essentially lanceolate outlines, and are lenticular in cross section (Fjg. 10, H , I) . The wedge-shaped base is either straight or convex, and the lateral edges of the blade (or shaft ) are convex. Relatively
large flake scars along the edges appear to represent marginal retouching. All are made of a locally-obtained, yellowish chert. The
length ranges from 26 to 45 mm., the maximum width from 8 to 10
mm., and the maximum thickness from 5 to 8 mm.
Type II. The two specimens (Fig. 10, J, K) representing this type
are distinguished from the above drills largely on the basis of their
thin, expanded stems. Both are bifacially chipped, although one (Fig.
10, K) has retained the nodular cortex across the base. The cross section is lenticular, lateral edges are slightly convex, and the base is
either convex or mildly concave. One of these drills (Fig. 10, J) is
made of chert, the other (Fig. 10, K ) of petrified wood. The former
specimen measures 41 mm. long, 15 mm. wide at the base, and 7 mm.
in maximum thickness; the latter specimen is 45 mm. long, 18 mm.
wide at the base, and 7 mm. thick.
GRAVERS

There are two small artifacts from the site-both from the surface
-that have tiny, beak-like projections. One of these (Fig. 11 , A, A')
is made from an orangish-red, plano-convex chert flake which has a
quite irregular outline. Fine marginal, pressure retouching is confined
to the distal end, where the lateral edges converge to form a graver.
This specimen has a maximum length of 25 mm. and a maximum
width of 16 mm. The second graver (Fig. 11, B, B') is somewhat larger
( 35 mm. long and 17 mm. wide) and has been fashioned from a
roughly triangular-shaped flake of petrified wood. The distal end has
been made into a small, but finely-pointed graver by means of pressure
flaking. A relatively high ridge appears on the dorsal surface of this
specimen. Both gravers are quite similar to those described by Tunnell
( 1961: 139) fortheRunnellsSiteNo.2.

240

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

SCRAPERS

Only four artifacts identifiable as scrapers were obtained from the
Zavonian Springs Site. One of these falls within the range of variation of Tunnell's ( 1961: 139) scraper Type I, while three are similar
to his Type II (ibid.: 139-140).

Type I. This type is represented by a small, plano-convex end
scraper made from a flake of orangish-red chert. It is roughly circular
in outline and has along one edge a steep scraping bit produced by
pressure flakjng. The dimensions are: length 30 mm., width 29 mm.,
and thickness 17 mm.
Type II. Three small flake scrapers displaying unifacial pressure
retouching along one or more edges are included in this group. One
of these has a convex scraping bit at the distal end. Its dimensions are:
length 19 mm., width 16 mm., and thickness 3 mm. The second specimen is worked along one edge and both ends; it is 26 mm. long, 18
mm. wide, and 4 mm. thick. On the third example, the marginal
chipping is confined to one lateral edge. This scraper is 18 mm. long,
18 mm. wide, and 4 mm. thick.
UTILIZED FLAKES

In addition to the scrapers described above, there are 35 flakes (almost exclusively of chert and petrified wood) showing evidence of
use. Twenty of these have limited bifacial chipping, and 15 have
unifacial flaking along the marginal of one or more edges. As a group,
however, they are considerably less modified than either the knives
or the scrapers; in fact, some of the flake scars may have resulted from
use rather than intent. One of the unifacially modified flakes is of a
cream colored flint, possibly obtained from central Texas.
CHOPPERS

Included in this group are seven specimens which are worked
primarily along one edge and which have retained a considerable
portion of cortex at the opposing edge (Fig. 11, C-F). Three are fashioned from chert, three from petrified wood, and one from ferruginous
sandstone. The chipping is crude, and consists of large, percussionproduced flake scars. The length ranges from 46 to 90 mm., the width
of the cutting edge from 32 to 62 mm., and the maximum thickness
from 11 to 50 mm.

Miscellaneous Stone
HAMMERSTONES

Thirteen irregularly-shaped nodules of chert and petrified wood
have one or more edges battered from use, but are otherwise unmodified . Maximum dimensions are: length 44 to 138 mm. , width 29 to 97
mm., and thickness 23 to 41 mm. In general, the chert hammerstones
tend to be smaller than those of pertrified wood.
MILLING SLABS

Two fragmentary milling slabs, both of ferruginous sandstone,
were recovered from the site. One (Fig. 11 , G ) is roughly diamondshaped in outline, and has a grinding basin in each face. These basins
vary from 3 mm. to 10 mm. in depth; the total length of the slab is
143 mm. , maximum width 100 mm., and maximum thickness 46 mm.
The second milling slab has a triangular outline and a shallow ( 4 .5
mm. deep) , basin-shaped concavity in one face. This specimen now
measures 128 mm. long, 87 mm. wide, and 51 mm. thick.
PITTED STONE

A nearly complete circular-shaped piece of ferruginous sandstone
has two small depressions, one in each opposing flat surface. The flat
surfaces are smooth, possibily from use as a mano. This specimen is
80 mm. in diameter and a maximum of 28 mm. in thickness. One pit
is 20 mm. in diameter and 1.5 mm. in depth, while the opposing depression is 22 mm. in diameter and 2 mm. in depth.
CORES

There are 16 small nodules of chert which show evidence of having been used primarily as cores. Most retain some of the weathered
cortex surface, but all bear at least several flake scars. The outlines are
roughly circular, with diameters ranging from 30 to 51 mm.
SMOOTHED AND PECKED STONES

Twelve small stones have worn facets and/ or pecked surfaces. They
are highly variable in outline form, with some being squarish to ovoid,
and others trianguloid to crescent-shaped. None, however, appears to
have been intentionally shaped. Most are of sandstone (fine-grained,
coarse-grained, and ferruginous ), although a few are of petrified wood.

243

ZAVON IAN SPRINGS SITE

The purpose of these stones is unknown; perhaps some may have been
polishing stones, some diminutive handstones, and others incipient
hammerstones. Their dimensions are: length 25 to 39 mm., width 22
to 25 mm., thickness 15 to 22 mm.
OCHER

A number ( 110) of small bits of ocher were found at the site,
especially in the deeper levels. Included are 32 pieces of limonite
and 78 pieces of hematite. Most were probably introduced into the site
and several smoothed pieces were almost certainly used as sources
of pigment.
ARTIFAcTs OF BoNE

Very little bone was recovered from the site, and each of the three
pieces that appears to be worked is in fragmentary condition. One of
these modified bones is a small, unidentifiable piece which has a "V"shaped notch in one edge. This piece is now 25 mm. long and 15 mm.
wide; the notch is 3 mm. wide and 2.5 mm. deep. A second specimen
appears to be a bone bead which has broken longitudinally. Both ends
have been cut and somewhat smoothed. This bead is 16 mm. long and
was about 15 mm. in diameter. The remaining bone artifact is possibly from the proximal end of an atlatl hook, since one end rises 10
mm. to form a triangular-shaped peak. Incomplete, this piece is presently 33 mm. long and 23 mm. wide.
ARTIFACTS OF METAL AND GLASS

The three upper levels (0.0 to 1.5 feet) at the site yielded various
objects of recent origin, such things as cartridge cases, shotgun shells,
bits of glass, nails, harness buckles, buttons, and the like. It is probable
that these represent articles lost by picnickers and various remains
from the sawmill. They have not been listed in Table I, although it
might be noted that the more deeply buried specimens were very
likely transported by rodents.
PROVENIENCE OF THE ARTIFACTS

In analyzing the distribution of the artifacts from the Zavonian
Springs Site, only the vertical proveniences were found to display
significant differences. These data are summarized in Table 1, where

burial (Fig. 2 )-the artifacts are plotted according to their vertical
occurrences (i.e. , surface and six-inch, one foot, and two-foot levels ) .
Among the more notable distributions is the tendency for dart points
to occur below pottery and arrow points. To be sure there are overlaps,
but dart points decidedly increase in frequency in the deeper (more
than two feet below the surface) levels. With the possible exception of
the Gary type, which is probably slightly later, there do not appear to
be meaningful differences in the distribution of the dart points. Other
specimens which occur in significant numbers in the lower levels are
the knives (especially Types II and III), drills, milling slabs, choppers,
and pieces of ocher.
The upper three feet of the deposit, on the other hand, contained
numerous potsherds, arrow points, and pieces of baked clay. Of these
specimens, the arrow points tended to be slightly shallower than the
pottery and the lumps of clay (some wattle-impressed ) were most
common in the six-inch to one-foot level. The clay-tempered, engraved
decorated sherds occurred at significantly shallower depths than the
other types of pottery-a stratigraphic position in keeping with the
engraved design similarities with later Caddoan types (especially
Poynor and Ripley Engraved). Possibly associated with the engraved
pottery is the Perdiz arrow point. Rectangular and expanded stem
arrow points (types Friley and Alba ) at the Zavonian Springs Site
may be slightly earlier than the pointed stem forms (Perdiz and
Cliffton ), but the evidence is admittedly weak. Likewise, there are
suggestions that the sand-tempered pottery may have appeared at the
site somewhat earlier than the clay-tempered wares, and moreover,
that it may be, in part, associated with Gary dart points.
To summarize the distributions of artifacts at the Zavonian Springs
Site, it should be noted that there are no clear-cut breaks in the provenience data, but rather trends which seem to be meaningful. Difficult
as they may be to factor out, these trends indicate significant changes
in the culture of the peoples who occupied the site.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Working mainly on weekends from the fall of 1961 through the fall
of 1962, the Sabine-Neches Archeological Society carried out extensive
test excavations at the Zavonian Springs Site in San Augustine County,
Texas. The site is buried in a sand-capped clay ridge adjacent to the
Angelina River bottoms and lies well within the McGee Bend Reservoir.
As a result of the excavations, 1,869 artifacts were recovered. The

vertical distribution of these specimens, presented in Table 1 and
briefly discussed in the preceding section, indicate that the site was
occupied over a considerable period of time and that certain changes
occurred in the material culture of the occupants. However, these
changes are manifested only as statistical trends, perhaps, because of
the deposition and/ or the disturbances caused by man and rodents .
They include :
1. Side-notched and parallel-sided or expanding dart points ( especially of the Kent type ) are generally found in deepest levels at the
site. Other possibly early traits include Knife Type III and drill Type L
2. Although there is overlap in their distribution, Gary dart points,
Knife Type II, drill Type I, and choppers, appear to be slightly later
than the above.
3. The arrival of sand-tempered pottery and Knife Type I mark
the next major change in the material culture. It is probable that Gary
points and Knife Type III continued in use.
4. Arrow points along with predominantly clay-tempered pottery
are consistently found in the upper three feet of the deposit, and, while
the evidence is not clear-cut, they appear to be, at least in part, later
than sand-tempered pottery.
5. Of the clay-tempered ceramics and arrow points, engraved
decorated pottery and Perdiz and Cliffton arrow point's are perhaps
the most recent types.
In general, these findings agree with the sequences outlined for the
McGee Bend area by Tunnell ( 1961 : 155-157 ) and Duffield (1963 :
137-140). Tunnell ( 1961 ), as a result of his analysis of selected remains from the Runnells No. 1, Runnells No. 2, and Sawmill sites,
distinguished three major periods of occupation. The first of these he
identified as late Archaic, and indicated the diagnostic traits as being
crudely made parallel-sided or expanding stem dart points (Kent-like
specimens ) and Knife Type I. Tunnell's subsequent period marks the
end of the Archaic and is distinguished principally by the arrival of
sand-tempered pottery and Type II Knives or blades. His final division
is marked by the appearance of arrow points and various clay-tempered
and bone-tempered types of pottery. The sequence of artifacts at the
Zavonian Springs Site is much the same, except that Knife Type I
appears to be later than indicated by Tunnell and the Gary dart point
perhaps should be added to this second period.

Recently Duffield (1963: 137-140) has published a somewhat more
detailed sequence for the McGee Bend area, based largely on data
obtained at the VVolfshead Site. Duffield's temporal ordering of artifact
types compares very favorably with the data from Zavonian Springs.
Significantly, his earliest material, identified as early Archaic, is not
present at the Zavonian Springs Site; nor were the latest types at
Zavonian Springs (engraved pottery and pointed stem arrow points)
found at theWolfshead Site.
While the details of the cultural sequence in the McGee Bend area
need verifying and refining, the broad developments seem reasonably
well established. The cultural affiliations, on the other hand, have
received much less attention and are much less well known. In terms
of general characteristics, both the Archaic and Neo-American remains
found in the McGee Bend Reservoir, are similar to materials found to
the north in the Caddoan area (Davis and Davis, 1960; Johnson, 1962;
Newell and Krieger, 1949; Suhm, et al., 1954) and to the south in the
Addicks Reservoir (Wheat, 1953 ) . The dart and arrow points types
occur over most of eastem Texas, while sand-tempered pottery is
abundantly found in southeastern Texas and decorated clay-tempered
wares are typical of the Caddoan cultures. The local Archaic remains,
however, are sufficiently distinct to make identification with a known
complex, such as the East Texas Aspect (Suhm, et al. , 1954: 148-151),
impossible. Of the later artifacts the clay-tempered pottery is perhaps
the most unique. In modes of decoration and general designs it bears
obvious relationships with Caddoan pottery, both Fulton and Gibson
Aspect types. Nonetheless, in design layout, crudeness of design execution and vessel shape, the McGee Bend pottery is clearly distinct from
that of the Caddoan area.
The cultural ties briefly reviewed above, hint at a fairly complex
situation, with far-flung relationships that appear to shift in direction
through time. The data from the Zavonian Springs Site clearly reflect
these varying influences, although much additional research is needed
to define their exact nature.
