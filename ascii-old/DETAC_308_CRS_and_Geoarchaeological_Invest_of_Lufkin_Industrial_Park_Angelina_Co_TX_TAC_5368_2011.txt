ABSTRACT
In August 2009, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants)
conducted a cultural resources survey of the Lufkin Industrial Park in Lufkin, Texas. The
industrial park includes 60.2 hectares (148.7 acres) along an upland ridge, slope, and
floodplain of the headwaters of an unnamed tributary to Paper Mill Creek. A visual
examination was conducted within the creek channel and over the entire surface with
shovel testing to investigate upland areas to the subsoil while backhoe trenches were
excavated in six locations within the floodplain and adjacent ridge crests and shoulders to
understand the geomorphological setting and examine the potential for deeply buried
cultural resources. Two new archaeological sites, 41AG203 and 41AG204, were identified
during the survey. Both sites were multi-component prehistoric and 20th century historic
period artifact scatters on sandy landforms. No cultural features were observed in shovel
testing on either site or in a backhoe trench excavated in 41AG204. The potential for
encountering cultural features on either site was determined to be low because of the deep
loose nature of the sandy soils with abundant modern mechanical disturbances observed on
the sites. None of the sites yielded artifacts diagnostic beyond the undecorated sherdletts
on 41AG204. The recovered artifacts were curated at the Stephen F. Austin State
University Anthroplogy Laboratory in Nacogdoches, Texas. DETAC requests a
determination of “no effect” to properties eligible for inclusion to the National Register
of Historic Places for the proposed development of the Lufkin Industrial Park.

INTRODUCTION

In August 2009, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants) conducted a
cultural resources survey of the Lufkin Industrial Park for the City of Lufkin (Figure 1). The
industrial park includes 60.2 hectares (148.7 acres) along an upland ridge, slope, and floodplain of
the headwaters of an unnamed tributary to Paper Mill Creek. This property will be managed by the
City of Lufkin, Texas. Cultural resource management was required under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit
#5368 was obtained and all terms of the permit were carried out.
Proposed developments within the project area are unknown at this time.

Planned

developments can include parking areas, buildings and any specialized structures associated with
various industries that will occupy portions of the property. A visual examination was conducted
within the creek channel and over the entire surface with shovel testing to investigate upland areas
to the subsoil while backhoe trenches were excavated in six locations within the floodplain and
adjacent ridge crests and shoulders to understand the geomorphological setting and examine the
potential for deeply buried cultural resources.
Two new archaeological sites, 41AG203 and 41AG204, were identified during the survey.
Both sites were multi-component prehistoric and historic period artifact scatters on sandy
landforms. No cultural features were observed in shovel tests or in a backhoe trench excavated in
41AG204. Site 41AG203 included prehistoric lithic debitage and a biface along with twentieth
century historic debris from a structure show on the topographic map and site 41AG204 contained
lithic debris, prehistoric ceramic sherds, and twentieth century historic debris from a structure
shown on the topographic map. The potential for encountering cultural features on either of the
sites was determined to be low because of the deep, loose, nature of the sandy soils and modern
disturbances observed on both sites. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of
“no effect” to cultural resources eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Archaeological Landmarks.
All fieldwork was conducted by Victor Galan, Ph.D. (Principal Investigator) and Perry
Brown.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The study area for the proposed waterline project falls within the Eastern Timbered Plain
Physiographic Province of east Texas. This province is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain
(Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG), 1970, 1977) and the Austroriparian biotic province. The
Austroriparian biotic province is typified by extensive pine and hardwood forests, swamps,
marshes, and other hydric communities (Blair 1950). This section is divided into three parts:
Geology, Paleoenvionment, and Soils to better understand the nature of the landforms and the
modern environmental setting,

Geology
The Gulf Coastal Plain was an elevated former sea bottom (Hunt 1974) formed during the
Cenozoic Era when cycles of transgression and regression of the ancestral Gulf of Mexico
deposited sands, shales, clays, and marls in sedimentary geologic formations.

Transgressive

deposits are generally clay and silty deposits making them more resistant to erosion. Regressive
deposits are generally silty and sandy and less resistant to erosion. More-resistant strata form
escarpments or cuestas with rolling hills and prairies (Fisher 1965). The streams that flow through
these hills and prairies typically had floodplains 1.6 to 16 km (1 to 10 miles) wide. These
floodplains generally occurred 30.5 to 46 m (100 to 150 ft) below the regular elevation of the land
creating narrower floodplains where streams cut through the cuestas.
The geologic unit in the area is limited to the Eocene age Yegua Formation. While not
mapped, Quaternary alluvium is depicted along Paper Mill Creek north of the project area (BEG,
1968) and may extend into the floodplain along the western edge of the project area. The Yegua
Formation consists of regressive deposits including clays over quartz sand and lignite. Any
Quaterary alluvium in the project area is significantly younger and, because of its location on the
landscape, has the only potential for containing deeply buried archaeological sites in colluvial
deposited material from the adjacent slopes. The Eocene formations are significantly older and
more stable consisting of sand and clay over bedrock. Understanding the Holocene Alluvium
deposits and the upland soils impacted by the proposed development relied on the information
derived from the Web Soil Survey (NRCS 2009).

3

Paleoenvironment
The Paleoenvironment for eastern Texas is largely dependent on information from
paleontological investigations of extinct flora and fauna as well as fossil pollen grains recovered
from bogs and archaeological sites in central, northern, and west Texas which contain deposits
spanning the past 34,000 years. Little paleoenvionmental information is available from east
Texas because there are few locations sheltered from the environment and the acidic oxisols and
alfisols combined with the repeated wetting and drying often destroy pollen grains (Bryant and
Holloway 1985:54).

Given the lack of information about the region directly, only

generalizations and simplifications of the environment are possible relying on data from adjacent
ecological regions.
Beginning in the Wisconsin Interpluvial Period between 33,500 and 22,500 B.P.,
environmental data suggests south and east Texas were at the boundary of scrubby vegetation
and grasslands to the west and deciduous forests to the east (Bryant and Schafer 1977:7; Bryant
and Holloway 1985:44) with a generally cooler and wetter climate than today (Bryant and
Holloway 1985:50). Although the source of the rivers were not glacial run-off, the Texas coastal
plain rivers, e.g., Angelina and Sabine rivers, were cooler and subsequent discharge into the Gulf
of Mexico cooler reducing the gulf temperature and subsequently reducing the precipitation
generated by warm water close to land and large scale Tropical cyclonic events (Blum and Aslan
2005:182). The effective moisture during this period was derived from mid-latitude events that,
when combined with the increased moisture, caused soil instability across the region (Blum and
Aslan 2005:183).
The Wisconsin Fullglacial Period between 22,500 and 14,000 B.P. was a shift to forests
in the region as vegetation change to more conifer, pine, and spruce trees (Bryant and Schafer
1977:11) in a semi-arid temperate woodland that covered central Texas, the northwestern gulf
coast, and present-day southern Louisiana (Adams and Faure 1997:630, 637). This semi-arid
temperate woodland included significantly cooler and moister summers but winters that were
similar to present day temperatures (Toomey et al. 1993:305).

Geomorphologically, the

Angelina River, like the Sabine and the Trinity, reacted to the drop in eustatic sea level causing
valley incision (Ferring 1990:45) which would have extended into Papermill Creek and the
project area as well.

4

The Late-Glacial period from 14,000 to 10,000 B.P. saw rapid increases in temperature
and associated decrease in effective moisture in three steps at 14,500 B.P., 12,500 B.P., and
10,500 B.P. which correspond with max meltwater discharge in glacier-fed rivers and decrease
evaporation (Toomey et al. 1993:306). The drier weather would lessen the recharge of rivers not
supplied by glaciers, e.g., the Angelina, Sabine and Trinity rivers, and may have reduced the
flow to braided streams allowing for increased alluvial deposits and more eolian movement of
sediments. These warming steps altered animal and plant life in the region with the return of
grass-dominated setting (Bryant and Schafer 1977:14) and caused widespread landscape
instabilities (Blum and Aslan 2005:183).
The Postglacial Period from 10,500 B.P. to present was a continuation of the Late-glacial
Period with temperate grasslands in a savanna setting (Bryant and Schafer 1977:18) that
extended from the gulf coast northward to Canada (Adams and Faure 1997:630, 637). These
conditions of warmer temperatures and drier climate continued until modern times that began
with a more grassland dominated environment around 9,500 B.P. but stabilized then became
extremely warm and dry between 7,000 and 5,000 B.P. (Ferring 1995:24) causing animals that
required more moisture to leave the area (Toomey et al. 1993:308). The environment rebounded
with wetter years between 5,000 and 2,000 B.P. For the last 1000 years dendrochonological data
(Stahle 1996) accurately shows smaller fluctuations of wet periods and dry (drought) lasting two
to three years on average continue until today; however, these changes are relatively short term
events that force local changes in environmental boundaries and the distribution of animals
across the landscape leading humans to adapt but continually thriving and becoming both more
populace and more environmentally specialized. Changes in the landscape follow climatic
changes with larger and more dramatic changes in stream channels and adjacent uplands
occurring early in the Postglacial Period while later climatic fluctuations are small with
landforms changing little in the past 5000 years.
The proposed development may include deep excavation.

Backhoe trenching was

necessary to account for the potential of impacting deeply buried cultural resources. In specific, the
goal is to find buried soils associated with periods of climatic stability in the past 11,000 years.

Soils
Soils within the project area range from shallow fine sandy loam on ridge summits to
deeper fine sandy loams on backslopes to dense loams and clays in the floodplain. These soils
conform geomorphic setting of the immediate area with the oldest unit (Yegua Formation of quartz
sand and clay) dissected by more modern deposits (sandy loam and clay) in the active floodplain.
According to the soil survey (NRCS 2009), the highest ridge has Rossenwall fine sandy loam
roughly 15 cm (6 inches) deep on the ridge summit and northeastern corner of the property. The
ridge to the south and the backslopes of both ridges is Alazan very fine sandy loam ranging from
25 cm (10 inches) to in excess of 283 cm (72 inches) deep. The soils are described as Koury loam
impacted by urban development includes loam, silt loam, and very fine sandy loam in excess of
158 cm (62 inches) and Moswell loam along the floodplain with urban development includes
roughly 20 cm (7 inches) of loam over clay within the floodplain. One area along the toe slope of
the highest ridge is mapped as “Pits” (Pa) where sand was quarried from the property.

To summarize the environmental setting, the geology is predominantly Eocene Epoch
sediments eroded into the current upland topography. Those deposits have eroded because of the
sandy nature of the deposits forming shallow draws that coalesce into a drainage channel along the
western edge of the property. The eroded material is deposited within the drainage channel as a
result of alternating between well vegetated and stable soil surfaces versus exposed soil surfaces
and mobile material in drier environments. The result is a series of low ridges and hills with
varying depths of sandy material over more resistant clay horizons and strata.

Material is

continually eroding into the drainage channel and being carried down stream but at a slower rate as
the modern soil surface is stabilized by a heavily vegetated environment.

Based on this

information, shovel testing is applicable in the upland, more stable, settings and backhoe trenching
is necessary to explore the floodplain for buried soil horizons and the potential for deeply buried
archaeological sites.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY

The Cultural Chronology is divided into Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Early Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic periods.

Each period was delineated by a change in environment,

technology, and/or population requiring adaptations to meet varying circumstances. Each period is
described in reference to the cultural phases within the period, settlement patterns, subsistence, and
artifacts associated with the period.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 8000 B.C.) is the earliest generally accepted cultural
period in the New World and includes populations that inhabited North America from the Late
Pleistocene to the early Holocene.

Paleo-Indian sites are typified by scattered Clovis,

Scottsbluff, Dalton, San Patrice, and Plainview projectile points, these sites are rare in the
region. Overall, tool types are generally carefully fashioned bifacal and unifacial tools. The use
of non-local materials and recycling lead Story (1990) to suggest this population was organized
into small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of plants and animals.
Paleo-Indian artifacts recovered in the region suggested that early occupations were principally
distributed in the valleys of major stream basins (Perttula 1995; Ricklis 2004:184). However,
observed sites from the Paleo-Indian period are less frequent in active floodplains because of the
changes in the landscape since those periods (Waters 1992:151).

Archaic
The Archaic (6000-400 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally
specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment. The Archaic period is represented by
three divisions: the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic during which tool technology progressed from
the large points that typify the Paleo-Indian period to the use of sand and grog tempered ceramics
and the bow and arrow in the Early Ceramic and Late Prehistoric. Later Archaic sites are more
abundant than earlier sites as populations shifted from major streams to minor streams and natural
springs (Story 1990). This greater number and distribution of Late Archaic sites suggests the
successful adaptation to the environment lasting until the development of pottery and/or the
development of the bow and arrow. Stone-lined hearths, baking pits, milling implements, and
7

polished stone serve as indicators of new technologies (Story 1990:213). When compared to
Paleo-Indian artifacts, Archaic lithic assemblages are more functionally varied; however, tool types
are generally less well made and of increasingly more local materials than the Paleo-Indian period
and earlier Archaic divisions (Ricklis 2004:184). Cemeteries date to the Archaic period as well
(Story 1990) and become an integral part of the late Archaic (Ricklis 2004:186). Projectile point
types associated with the Archaic period include earlier expanded stem, corner-notched, and side
notched points followed by stemed points Bulverde, Yarbrough, Travis, and Palmillas and late
Archaic Gary, Enso, and Godley.

Early Ceramic Period
The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) period (Story 1990:293), also referred to as the
Woodland period (Perttula et al. 1986), represented an increasing utilization of the environment.
A number of characteristic innovations appear during the Early Ceramic period. In particular,
there is a greater reliance on cultigens along with larger and more prolonged occupations at
specific locales. The technological innovation appearing during the Early Ceramic period was
the widespread production of pottery and the introduction of the bow and arrow very late in the
period (Story et al. 1990; Thurmond 1990). Pottery, or at least the surface decorations, were
probably introduced from the Lower Mississippi Valley as Marksville Stamped, Marksville Incised,
Tchefuncte Stamped, Troyville Stamped, and Chrupa Incised. These decorative types were found
along the Sabine River (Story 1990; Thurmond 1988; Cliff and Peter 1994:23) while south of the
Sabine River ceramics are mostly plain sandy paste Mossy Grove varieties (Story 1990, Ricklis
2004:189). Gary and Kent projectile points were made smaller and lighter and corner-notched
arrow points enter the archaeological record at this period as well (Thrumond 1990) with a similar
split along the Sabine River having a variety of stemmed arrow points to the south (Perttula
2004:376). Populations throughout the region were attempted to utilize plant resources along
valley margins as sites were located along increasingly larger landforms and covered larger areas
(Corbin 1998:115).

8

Late Prehistoric Period
In the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800-1680) Angelina County serves as a boundary
between the Caddoan culture to the north and the Atakapain Bidias to the south. The Caddo
culture was an indigenous development strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of the
Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323; Wycoff 1971) while the Bidias cultural development
was strongly influenced by the Gulf Coast Goose Creek tradition around 200 B.C. or from the
Tchefuncte complex in western Louisiana (Ricklis 2004:200). Caddo subsistence and social
organization differed markedly from the Archaic and Early Ceramic periods as horticulture
supplemented hunting and gathering followed by a diet dominated by maize, beans, and squash.
Increasingly larger aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public
ceremonial areas. A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as
first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also established with
hamlets and farmsteads surrounding larger community mound center. Settlements were mainly
distributed on elevated landforms adjacent to major streams, as well as along minor tributaries and
spring-fed branches. The Late Prehistoric Period has been divided into Formative, Early, Middle,
and Late Caddoan phases. The phases indicate changes in socio-political, habitation, and material
culture. Overall, the Late Prehistoric Period to the north is typified by a variety of arrowpoints,
ground stone artifacts, and a ceramic vessel types. Smith (1995:14) describes the Bidias as less
advanced as the Caddo in material culture and subsistence strategies relying less on agriculture and
more on the hunting/gathering traditions of there Atakapain ancestors. While technologically
southern Bidias and northern Caddo are separate, the Caddo design styles influenced Bidias
ceramic decoration (Ricklis 2004:200). Distinguishing the two cultures in a cultural boundary
relies on analysis of the ceramic collection. Schafer and others (1975:251) as well as Ricklis
(2004) provides examples of the similarities and differences between the two ceramic traditions
based on manufacture technique.

Historic
Angelina was initially inhabited by Anglo settlers in the 1820’s and 1830’s but was not
recognized as a separate county until 1846 when Nacogdoches County was divided. Increasing
numbers of Americans came to the area increasing the population of farmers and their slaves as the
land was planted in cotton in the 1850’s.

The second largest industry was livestock.
9

Transportation of crops and animals initially involved travel along the Angelina and Neches rivers;
however, it changed to the East and West Railway between Houston and Shreveport in the 1890’s.
Lufkin began as a railroad town in 1882. The K& GSL railroad laid out town plots but retained
90% of the land and sold the lots to persons interested in building the town (Haltom 1969:48).
Early Lufkin relied on a small lumber industry but quickly grew. After the Civil War, Angelina
County more farmers changed from livestock to lumber as the population decreased.

The

population quickly increased again with the popularity of southern pine as a building material.
Associated sawmills and railroad lines were built to support the growing industry. The Great
Depression affected the lumber industry forcing Angelina County residence to return to raising
livestock and subsistence farming. After the depression, Angelina County steadily grew as the
lumber industry returned, raising livestock became more popular, and timber related industry was
introduced to the area and continues to dominate a divers economy today (THA 2009).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The archaeological regional overview documents of primary importance are D.A. Story's
(1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally, the Texas
Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a document for the east
Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). This document included
several historic contexts each of which dealt with a particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory.
This plan synthesized the state of archaeological research in the region and identified problems and
objectives to be addressed in future research and cultural resources management. Several weak
areas in archaeological knowledge of the region were identified in these recent studies.
Chronology, settlement patterns, subsistence, and historic continuities were some of the general
research directions that all of these recent syntheses emphasized as important for developing future
archaeological research designs. More recently, Perttula (2004) includes the most up to date
descriptions of region, i.e., Perttula 2004:370-408, for the Caddo Cultural Area which extends from
Texarkana to Angelina County and Ricklis (2004:181-204) for southeast Texas which extends from
the Gulf Coast to Angelina County. The descriptions of large-scale and smaller investigations
below are more specific to Angelina County.
Large-scale investigations including research within specific drainage systems and
extensive excavations on large sites have been conducted across the region providing most of the
prehistoric and historic cultural information. Substantial investigations began in the 1930s with the
University of Texas surveys along major stream valleys.

Later large survey areas include

investigations for the Sabine and Angelina National Forests, e.g., Treiweiler et. al. 2002. These,
and other, large area surveys document a majority of the archaeological sites recorded and provide
the basis for predicting site locations across the landscape, e.g., Thurmond 1990. Investigations
within Angelina County were conducted in the Angelina National Forest and adjacent to the Sam
Rayburn reservoir along the Angelina River. Other investigations were conducted for private
interests and for TxDot scattered across the county. Previous investigations in the Angelina
National Forest, e.g., Skiles 1991, and along the Sam Rayburn Reservoir, e.g., Treiweiler and
Galan 2002, have focused on timber sales and oil/gas well locations and pipelines. Other work
across the county is primarily surveys for well locations, e.g., Taylor 1995, and city infrastructure,
e.g., Galan 2007.
11

SURVEY DESIGN

Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2009) based on maps and files at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), J.J. Pickle Research Campus, UT. The site location maps and
cultural resources records at TARL were consulted to identify the location, types, and both State
Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites within or in
close proximity to the project areas. The Site Atlas also contains information about published
and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.
DETAC performed these investigations in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law [PL] 89-665), as amended in 1974 (PL 97-442), 1976 and
1980; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 81-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4321,
1970); Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800); the
Archeological Resources protection Act of 1979; and the other appropriate cultural resources
legislation and guidelines. The investigations also complied with the procedural rules of the
Texas Antiquities Code.
To aid in the survey, high and low probability areas were determined by
combining the previous site information with topographic and soils data. Based on the previous
instigations in the area and other surveys in east Texas, archaeological sites were more likely to
be found on level landforms with deep well-drained soils near surface water resources as these
environments provide dryer conditions for year-round occupation and necessary water (Galan
1996; 1997). Cultural resources on floodplains are less frequent unless the site is on a levee or
other sandy landform that is smaller than the mapped soil series as described in Thurmond
(1990:217 Figure 29) survey of the Cypress Creek Drainage Basin. Using these criteria, those
lowland areas and the first upland terraces along seasonal drainages, were considered high
probability areas. Sites in seasonally wet areas are typically more ephemeral occupations and
are frequently destroyed by annual flooding and stream channel migration. The final criterion
for determining the level of investigation was established on the amount of previous disturbance.
Leveling land for houses, driveways, and ancillary roads impacted the project area in several
locations.

12

The survey was conducted using a visual assessment and shovel testing at high and low
probability areas in accordance with the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines for cultural
resources surveys for areas between 11 and 100 acres. The visual assessments were conducted by
walking over the project area looking for structural remains and areas of potential high probably
not visible on the topographic maps and inspecting the exposed ground surfaces (recent utility
excavations, slope erosion, cutbanks, and animal disturbances). Shovel tests were approximately
30 cm (12 inches) in diameter.

Shovel testing included excavating in 10-centimeter (cm)

increments to the Bt horizon or to 90+ cm. All excavated matrix was screened through .25-inch
hardwire cloth.

The depth, soil texture, and color of each shovel test were recorded as part of a

GPS position with 3 to 5 m (10 to 16 ft) accuracy.
For each archaeological site recorded, DETAC completed several field procedures.
Initially, the area surrounding the newly located site was intensely inspected and shovel tests were
placed at 10-m to 20-m intervals to define the spatial boundaries and vertical depth of the deposits
of the site. All site locations were collected with a GPS and plotted on 7.5’ USGS topographic
quadrangle maps. All information was recorded on a standard Texas Archaeological Site Form
(TexSite v. 2.0). Field sketch maps were completed for all sites and color photographs were taken
to document the physiographic setting.

All of the photographs were recorded on standard

DETAC/TARL photographic logs. Any artifacts collected were washed, cataloged, and curated at
the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory in Austin.
After shovel testing and the visual examination, DETAC excavated backhoe trenches to
explore the geomorphological setting of the project area and understand the depositional nature of
the floodplain. Additionally, a variation between 30 m (100 ft) near the southern border and up to
100 m (330 ft) near the central portion of the project area was present when comparing the
topographic map to GPS data. Backhoe trenching included excavating a trench roughly 7 m (20 ft)
long and 2 m (6 ft) deep. Trench width varied as one wall was left vertical and the opposite was
stepped for safety. The vertical wall was photographed, shoveled and toweled smooth, and
described.

RESULTS

The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2009) was consulted for the locations of
known archaeological sites, NRHP properties, and State Archaeological Landmarks. Several
Neighborhood surveys were conducted within the city limits. There are twelve National Register
Properties and six Historical Markers were documented in downtown Lufkin roughly 3 km (2
miles) southwest of the project area. One additional Historical marker is located roughly 530 m
(1804 ft) east-southeast of the project area. The marker is for the Southland Paper Mills, Inc.
which was the first mill to produced southern pines into newsprint in 1940 (THC 2009). The
Site Atlas also lists 202 previously recorded sites in Angelina County. Of the previously
recorded sites, four were listed as State Archaeological Landmarks; none are within 3.6
kilometers (2 miles) of the project area. Previous archaeological surveys within a mile of the
proposed industrial park include a survey for a pipeline and two surveys for roads with no
documented sites. North of and adjacent to the property Murin and others (2000) conducted a
cultural resources survey of 290-acres of Kit McCommico Park documenting six sites, 41AG174
through 41AG179, and Brownlow (2002) conducted a survey for a 17-acre annex to the park
documenting two sites (41AG180 and 41AG181). The six sites documented by Murin and
others include four with petrified wood debitage (only 41AG178 contained additional petrified
wood bifaces and other lithic material) and one historic period site along upland ridges
overlooking the floodplain of an unnamed tributary to Paper Mill Creek. Sites 41AG180 and
41AG181 documented by Brownlow (2002) include petrified wood debitage along with sand
tempered sherds on low rises in the floodplain. Site 41AG180 also included bone, charcoal, and
seeds along with historic period debris. Additional testing was recommended for both 41ag180
AND 41AG181. Given the similarity in setting, these previous investigations suggest any sites
found in the project area will most likely contain scattered petrified wood debitage and ceramic
artifacts along with historic period debris on landforms overlooking the floodplain or on small
elevated sandy landforms within the floodplain. For reporting purposes, the description of the
survey is divided into three parts: Shovel testing and Visual Examination, Geoarchaeological
Investigations, and Site Descriptions.

Shovel testing and Visual Examination
Shovel testing and visual examination of the project area included walking transects
across the property making notes on surface disturbance and shovel testing and low and high
probability intervals. The visual examination also included comparing the 2004 NAIP Colorinfrared air photos and soils information to the current condition of the project area.
Color-infrared air photo (TNRIS 2009) shows several modern features helpful in
understanding the present situation on the ground. In general, the air photo shows the area was
mostly forested with clearings around modern activity, e.g., buildings or land use (Figure 2).
The vegetation pattern shows the ridge slope along the northern border is contoured and may
have planted trees. The floodplain near the area labeled “Pa” on the soils map has either open
ground or immature vegetation. Other features observed on the air photo include standing
buildings near the northeast corner of the property with a large stripped or plowed areas to the
south, west, and east; a trailer with a small parking lot along the western border; and a network
of unimproved roads.
The visual examination found that the property was logged and contoured in the recent
past. Shin high grasses dominated the area with some areas of head high bushes and shrubs.
Isolated trees were observed on the highest ridge near the northern boundary and along the
drainage channels that flow from the higher elevations to the east toward the narrow floodplain
on the western border of the project area. Evidence of contouring included parallel ridges along
the slopes of the hills and level ridges with steep angled slopes overlooking the creek within and
east of the “Pa” area (Figure 2). Additionally, no building visible on the topographic map or air
photos was standing. Visits to these locations found scattered bricks and other items described
in the site description section.
Shovel testing in the project area focused on upland ridges overlooking the floodplain
and investigating the uplands for evidence of the historic period buildings visible on the
topographic map and air photo (Figure 3). Changes in the topography by leveling and logging
focused shovel tests at high probability intervals to discrete ridges overlooking the creek channel
and on the summit of the ridge in the northeast corner of the property. Shovel testing over the
southeast and central portions focused on investigating the summits and shoulders of the two
wide ridges that dominated the landscape. Shovel tests were not excavated in the floodplain as
recent rain left much of the area in ankle deep water. No rises were visible in the standing water.

Backhoe trenches were excavated west of the creek to explore drier areas. A total of 158 shove
tests were excavated across the project area. Shovel testing found isolated areas with exposed
clay on shoulder slopes and isolated areas with over 70 cm of gravely light brown loamy sand.
A majority of the tests found between 20 and 50 cm of gravely light brown sandy loam over
clay. Gravels were almost exclusively petrified wood which flaked when struck with a shovel.
Shovel testing was successful in finding artifacts at 41AG203 and 41AG204. Shovel test data is
presented in Appendix A.
The visual examination and comparison to air photos show the area was heavily used for
commercial purposes in the past to include varying quarry operations for sand and logging.
Shovel testing found disturbed loose sandy soil with abundant petrified wood gravel. Shovel
testing found evidence of two sites and further evidence of the amount of disturbance in the
recent past.

Geoarchaeological Investigations
Geoarchaeological investigations included examining the stream channel for cutbanks
and excavating trenches to understand the depositional environment of the floodplain and to
determine if the difference in the stream channel on the topographic map versus GPS data is the
result of avulsion, migration, or modern rerouting. Walking the creek found abundant cobble to
pebble size petrified wood gravels with very fine sand and silt materials along a meandering
stream channel. The channel was roughly 3 m (10 ft) deep with steep sides and a base roughly 2
m (7 ft) wide with clay and silt matrix and petrified wood cobbles and pebbles on bars.
Examination of the cut banks revealed stratified mudstone deposits from the base of the stream
channel up to the modern soil.
Based on these observations, three trenches (BHT 1, 2, and 3) were excavated between
the sewer line and the modern channel to explore for buried soils west of the modern channel.
East of the modern stream channel, trenches were excavated in the floodplain (BHT 6), on a
slope shoulder (BHT 5), and on a narrow ridge summit at 41AG204 (BHT4). Combined, the six
trenches give an overview of the floodplain and the adjacent uplands. The following description
describes the profiles and the results of the trenching effort. Backhoe trench data is presented in
Appendix B while representative profiles are presented in Figure 4 (Backhoe trench profiles and
project area cross-section) and Figure 7 (site 41AG204 profile).

Backhoe trenches 1, 2, and 3 were excavated adjacent to an abandoned stream channel,
depicted on the topographic map to explore for buried soils. Combined with BHT 6, these four
trenches describe the floodplain in the project area. Of the four trenches, BHT 2 was not
profiled because the soil was very wet and the walls collapsed making the unit unsafe. The
remaining three trenches were profiled. Profiles for BHT 1 and 3 revealed generally shallow
disturbed A horizons over weakly developed B horizons and coarse sand C horizons. The A
horizons were impacted by modern development and clearing of the area. The B horizons were
generally thickly bedded with red and brown mottles. Leaching was most prevalent in lower
horizons with vertical gray, dark brown, and red coarse mottles. Textures were sandy loam to
loamy sand with coarser sands toward the lower horizons.

Backhoe trench 6 was excavated in

the floodplain east of the creek. The A horizons in BHT6 included an Ap disturbed by clearing
and an A/B horizon with increasing clay content and mottling with depth. The B horizon was
predominantly clay with gray and red mottles.

No buried soil horizons were found.

In

conclusion, the trenches revealed a meandering stream with upward fining sequences. Frequent
saturation is evident.
Backhoe trenches 4 and 5 were excavated in uplands. Both profiles included a thick
disturbed A horizon as a result of land clearing. In BHT4 the B horizon is mixed with the A
horizon in the upper part and more distinct in the lower part. In BHT5 the B horizon is old and
eroded by a well developed E horizon following the description in Schatzel and Anderson
(2005:370-373) as percolating water penetrates the Bt and acidic sands in the E degrade the Bt.
In BHT4 the C horizon is thinly bedded and includes gravels in the lower part. No C horizon
was observed in BHT5. In conclusion, the upland trenches show the uplands are disturbed in the
upper portions of the profiles. The major landform (BHT5) includes an old soil column with
well defined horizons. Closer to the ridge shoulders (BHT4) the disturbance is deeper and the
soil is younger but still has a developed B horizon.

Site Descriptions
41AG203
Site 41AG203 is multi-component prehistoric lithic scatter and historic occupation. The
site is is located on the summit of a large upland ridge in the northeastern portion of the project
area (Figure 4). The prehistoric component consists of three petrified wood flakes and one

petrified wood biface; although, flakes were difficult to distinguish as many flakes were
produced chipping nodules naturally in the soil. The historic component consists of 28 historic
period artifacts found in shovel tests along with several surface features.
Surface features on 41AG203 found a green-rock driveway, cement pad, brick scatter,
and a crype myrtle tree. The site is visible as a standing structure on 2005 color infrared air
photo with stripped areas to the west, east, and south. The southern one is visible on the ground
as a cut area. Vegetation is dominated by various pasture grasses and scattered hard wood trees.
Ground surface visibility is limited to less than 10% by a grass and shrubs. Soil consists of
Rosenwall fine sandy loam (NRCS 2009) roughly 80 cm (32 inches) deep with common petrified
wood pebbles and cobbles.
A total of eighteen shovel tests were excavated across the ridge. The nine shovel tests
higher on the landform and closer to the structures depicted on the topographic map were both
deeper and positive. The remaining nine were off the summit of the landform, except two, and
were shallower and negative. All shovel tests were excavated to a gradual accumulation of clay
between 40 and 80 cmbs (16 and 32 inches). Based on the soil description, this transition marks
the beginning of a sandy clay loam Bt horizon. Natural pebble and cobbles of petrified wood
were common in the shovel testing.
Cultural features on the site were limited to a green-rock driveway with cement near the
north end. A brick scatter was observed near the south end of the driveway near the location of a
building on the topographic map. Bricks included three varieties of dry press bricks. One
variety was a light red and had "Kooken" stamped on one face, one was a more compact matrix
and light red with no stamp, and the last was a light brown with manganese inclusions.
“Kooken” brick is described as a 1920’s manufacture in Ferris, Texas (Gurkey 1987).
A total of 28 historic and four prehistoric artifacts were found on the site. The historic
artifacts included 2 molded whiteware sherds, three wire nail fragments, 11 clear bottle glass
shards, four window glass shards, and 8 unknown vessel glass shards. Prehistoric artifacts
included three petrified wood tertiary flakes and one (broken in two pieces) petrified wood
biface. Lithic artifacts were not diagnostic, but the historic artifacts were from the 20th century.
In summary, this site is a multi-component historic/prehistoric site. The prehistoric
component is small and difficult to distinguish from natural petrified wood found in the soil.
The historic component is on or near the surface. The deep loose nature of the soil combined
22

with modern disturbance has destroyed site integrity. The paucity of artifacts suggests the
prehistoric component of site 41AG203 was a short-term occupation that may have consisted of
individual testing gravels. The friable soils and historic period disturbance suggest there is a low
chance of encountering intact features on the site.

DETAC requests concurrence with a

determination of “no effect” for 41AG203 as the site is ineligible for nomination to the NRHP.
No further work is recommended.

41AG204
Site 41AG204 is a multi-component prehistoric lithic and ceramic artifact scatter and
historic occupation on the summit of a narrow ridge overlooking the unnamed creek in the
southwest corner of the project area (Figure 5). The prehistoric component consists of two
petrified wood flakes and three sherds. The historic component consists of 9 historic period
artifacts found in shovel tests and one found in BHT 4.

Unlike 41AG203, the historic

component is not visible on the air photo but is visible on the topographic map as a single
structure and an unimproved dirt road.

The area was cleared and leveled in the recent past as

no trees were growing on the ridge summit. Vegetation is dominated by various pasture grasses
while hard wood trees dominate the slopes of the ridge. A backhoe trench profile had disturbed
soils and historic artifacts down to 70 cmbs (28 inches). No cultural features were observed on
the surface or in profile on the site.
A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated across the landform. Of these, five were
positive (three for historic artifacts and two for prehistoric artifacts) and one glass shard was
found in the profile of BHT 4. Horizontally, the positive and negative tests are mixed with no
clearly defined site boundaries. Vertically, the majority of the artifacts were found in the upper
40 cmbs (16 inches) with prehistoric and historic artifacts found in Level 1 and a glass shard
found in Level 6.
Backhoe trench 4 was excavated on the central portion of the site closest to the shovel
tests with prehistoric artifacts. The profile from the trench included disturbed fine sandy loam in
the upper 70 cm with a zone with elements of both the presumed A and B horizons although not
as disturbed as the A horizons above (Figure 6). Below the B horizon the C horizon graded from

a mixture with the B and pebble to coarse sand size gravels below in a clay matrix. Based on
this profile, the upper portion is mechanically disturbed while the lower portion is not disturbed
but weakly formed.
The historic artifacts included seven molded whiteware sherds, one clear and one brown
bottle glass shards, and one window glass shard. Prehistoric artifacts included two petrified
wood tertiary flakes and three sherdlets with two sand and one grog/bone temper. None of the
prehistoric artifacts were diagnostic. The historic period artifacts were typical of mid 20th
century housewares.
The site is small consisting of a scatter of 15 artifacts from the Late Prehistoric and
Historic periods. The prehistoric lithic component is small and difficult to distinguish from
natural petrified wood found in the soil while the sherds are more distinctive but not diagnostic.
The historic component is on the topographic map as a structure, but no evidence, beyond the
artifacts, was found.

Backhoe trench 4 was excavated on the site.

The profile includes

mechanical disturbance down to 80 cmbs with a glass shard found 80 cmbs over natural soil
horizons. The deep loose nature of the soil combined with modern disturbance has destroyed
site integrity.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Lufkin Industrial Park consists of 60.2 hectares (148.7 acres) along an upland ridge,
slope, and floodplain of the headwaters of an unnamed tributary to Paper Mill Creek. Planned
developments can include parking areas, buildings and any specialized structures associated with
various industries that will occupy portions of the property. Visual examination shovel testing
and backhoe trenching was employed to explore low and high probability areas for
archaeological sites and determine the potential for buried cultural resources within the
floodplain of the creek.
Examination of air photos and a visual inspection discovered one site 41AG203 while a
second site, 41AG204, was found through shovel testing. Both sites contained prehistoric and
historic period artifacts and the historic component was visible on the topographic map. Site
41AG203 included prehistoric lithic debitage and a biface along with twentieth century historic
debris along with a green-rock driveway, cement pad, brick scatter, and a crype myrtle tree. Site
41AG204 contained lithic debris, prehistoric ceramic sherds, and twentieth century historic
debris. A backhoe trench excavated in 41AG204 found disturbed soil to 80 cmbs over loamy
sand. The potential for encountering cultural features on either of the sites was determined to be
low because of the deep, loose, nature of the sandy soils and modern disturbances observed on
both sites. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no effect” to cultural
resources eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or the State
Archaeological Landmarks. If, during construction, artifacts are found, then work should stop in
the immediate area and both the Texas Historic Commission and DETAC should be contacted
immediately.

Backhoe Trench 2
Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated east of the abandoned channel. Observed soils
were sandy and became saturated roughly 100 cmbs. The wall collapsed before a profile
could be cleaned and photographed; therefore, no detailed profile was prepared. Based
on the backhoe cut surface, the upper portion is darker brown than the lower portion with
roots exposed and a fine sandy loam texture. Mottles are common, medium and
prominent browns in a gray matrix. Below 100 cmbs the collapsed wall exposed a
heavily leached horizon. The soil was heavily mottled and leached coarse to fine sand.
Mottles are many extremely coarse and prominent. No well developed Bt horizon was
observed.
