ABSTRACT
The City of Austin is studying the feasibility of expanding the Evergreen
Cemetery in east Austin near the intersection of East 12th Street and Airport
Boulevard. Baker-Aicklen & Associates, Inc. hired Hicks & Company to study
the potential impact of the expansion of the cemetery on cultural resources in
the area. Since the project is sponsored by the City of Austin and located on
land owned by the City, the project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT).
The investigations consisted of an initial archival search to identify all previously
recorded surveys, archeological sites, and historic structures within the
proposed project area. A coordination letter was then drafted and submitted to
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) for review, summarizing current
knowledge of the project area and recommending an archeological
reconnaissance survey. The THC concurred with the recommendations, and
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit #5075 was issued for the
archeological investigations.
Archeological reconnaissance survey investigations were conducted in order to
re-assess existing grave monuments associated with the late nineteenth/early
twentieth century Highland Park Cemetery (Site 41TV1755) that was identified
during a previous archeological survey (Jones and Iruegas 1995), locate any
additional evidence for interments, and assess the current condition of the
proposed project area relative to its potential for containing intact archeological
resources. All investigations were limited to surface inspection only. Archival
and limited oral history research was also employed to better clarify the
ownership, history of use of the cemetery, and its spatial boundaries. These
investigations were then utilized to develop recommendations for further work
based on the probability of encountering additional site components and to
comply with the ACT.
Based on the results of the investigations, the proposed project area has a high
potential for late nineteenth/early twentieth century graves associated with the
Highland Park Cemetery (41TV1755). However, the use of the proposed project
area for dumping of trash and fill has resulted in severe modification of the
original surface, limiting the utility of this archeological investigation.
Consequently, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that further
archeological and historical investigations are necessary prior to initiating
construction. Recommendations for further work include additional subsurface
testing of the potential project expansion (once it has been identified) area to
investigate the possibility of intact graves associated with the use of the property
as Highland Park Cemetery as well as to determine the late nineteenth and early
twentieth century land surface. The collection of additional archival documents
and oral history is also recommended to provide a more detailed history of the
cemetery, refine the potential location of any burials, and establish connections
between any burials encountered with surviving family members.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit #5075, and all project
related documents and photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL).

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The City of Austin (COA) is currently considering the feasibility of expanding
Evergreen Cemetery, located at the intersection of East 12th Street and Airport
Boulevard in Austin, Travis County, Texas. Currently Evergreen Cemetery is
near capacity for new interments. The proposed project involves expanding into
an approximately one acre tract somewhere within the area depicted in pink on
Figure 1, bounded by Tannehill Branch to the east. Such an expansion could
require substantial amounts of fill in order to raise the existing ground surface
of the northeast section of the cemetery grounds and create a continuous
surface area that would permit the placement of new burials.
Previous
archeological survey and historical research (Jones and Iruegas 1995) had
identified late nineteenth and twentieth century grave markers associated with
Highland Park Cemetery (Site 41TV1755) along Tannehill Branch, near the
northeast edge of the proposed project area. Hicks & Company was contracted
by Baker-Aicklen on behalf of the COA to identify any previously unrecorded
cultural resources that may exist within the project area and to assess the
potential impacts of the cemetery expansion on these resources. Because the
cemetery is owned by the COA, the current project is subject to the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT).
The investigations consisted of an initial archival search to identify all previously
recorded surveys, archeological sites, and historic structures within the
proposed project area. A coordination letter was then drafted and submitted to
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) for review, summarizing current
knowledge of the project area and recommending an archeological
reconnaissance survey (Appendix A).
The THC concurred with the
recommendations, and archeological reconnaissance survey investigations were
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit #5075 in order to
re-assess existing grave monuments associated with the late nineteenth/early
twentieth century Highland Park Cemetery identified during a previous
archeological survey (Jones and Iruegas 1995), locate any additional evidence for
interments, and assess the current condition of the proposed project area
relative to its potential for containing intact archeological resources. Archival
and limited oral history research was also employed to better clarify the property
ownership, history of cemetery use, and its spatial boundaries. These
investigations were then utilized to develop recommendations for further work
based on the probability of encountering additional components and to comply
with the ACT.
Based on the results of the investigations, it has been determined that the
proposed project area may be within the boundaries of the Highland Park
Cemetery, and as such there is a high potential for encountering intact late
nineteenth and early twentieth century graves beyond those already identified.
However, the use of the proposed project area for dumping trash and fill
Evergreen Cemetery (Figure 2) has resulted in the severe modification of the
original surface of the project area, limiting the utility of this archeological
investigation. Consequently, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that
further archeological and historical investigations are warranted prior to any
expansion of the cemetery or burial activities to assess potential impacts to
possible extant remnants of the Highland Park Cemetery.

Project Setting and Previous Investigations

PROJECT SETTING AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The project area is situated along the north and east sides of Sections F and G of
Evergreen Cemetery (see Figure 2). In the areas currently being utilized as
grave plots for Evergreen Cemetery, access roads have been built and the
surface is cleared with only scattered trees (Figures 2 and 3). Topographically,
much of the proposed project area is characterized by a steeply sloping ground
surface that drops northeast-ward down into the Tannehill Branch floodplain
from the high upland terrace (Figure 4). As discussed in more detail in the
Results of Reconnaissance Survey, the edges and slopes of the upper terrace
have been extensively modified as a result of cemetery use as well as dumping.
Currently, much of the proposed project area is heavily wooded and overgrown
with grasses and low shrubs (Figure 5).
Geologically, the upper terrace is characterized as a Pleistocene-age Upper
Colorado River terrace deposit (Qucr) consisting of gravel, sand, silt and clay
(Geologic Map of the Austin Area, Texas 1992). The portion of the proposed
project area in the lower Tannehill Branch creek floodplain is composed of the
Cretaceous age Taylor Group (Kta), a dark gray to green-gray, calcareous,
montmorillonitic clay (Proctor et al. 1981). The Soil Survey of Travis County
(Werchan et al. 1974) classifies the soils on the upland terrace overlooking
Tannehill Branch as Travis Soils and Urban Land, one to eight percent slope
(TuD), and the slopes and lower floodplain as Urban Land and Ferris Soils, 10 to
15 percent slope (UvE). The TuD soils are undifferentiated soils consisting of a
mix of Travis soils, other soils, and urban development. Typically these soils
consist of a deposit of gravelly sand up to 18 inches thick overlying red sandy
clay. During the field investigations, this type of soil was observed on the upper
terrace in the areas being utilized for interments in Section F and G of Evergreen
Cemetery (Figure 6). The UvE soils characteristic of the slopes and lower
floodplain are also undifferentiated and generally consist of a combination of
urban land, Ferris soils, and other soils. A typical soil profile consists of a layer
of olive-gray clay up to 36 inches thick overlying pale yellow silty clay.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
According to available data, there are no Official State Historical Markers
(OSHMs) located within the proposed project area. Nor are there any State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs) or sites listed on the National Register of
Historical Places (NRHP). However, both the early twentieth century sections of
Evergreen Cemetery (41TV1705) and the previously described, surviving
elements of the late nineteenth/early twentieth century Highland Park Cemetery
(41TV1755) have been designated archeological sites and assigned trinomials.
Only limited archeological survey has been conducted within the proposed
project area.
In 1995, Hicks & Company archeologists, surveying along
Tannehill Branch, where it borders the project area on the north and east,
encountered human remains eroding out of the creek bank below Evergreen
Cemetery (Jones and Iruegas 1995). Subsequent survey of the terrace south
and west of the creek located six grave markers dating to as early as the 1890s
in the heavily vegetated areas outside of their survey project area (Figure 7).
Archival research determined that the site was part of Highland Park Cemetery,
a late nineteenth and early twentieth century, privately-owned and managed
cemetery.

Tannehill Branch floodplain.

In addition to the grave markers, a large area of non-native Vinca minor,
sometimes called grave myrtle, was also noted in the vicinity of the grave
markers. The investigators interpreted this ornamental ground cover as being
associated with the use of the property as the Highland Park Cemetery, and
suggested the cemetery was larger than indicated by the presence of the existing
grave monuments. Because the 1995 Hicks & Company survey encountered the
human remains and headstones outside of their survey area, it was not possible
to more systematically define the full extent of intact late nineteenth and early
twentieth century cemetery features.

Historical and Archeological Research Methodology

HISTORICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
METHODOLOGY
In order to assess the potential for impacting new or previously documented
components of the Highland Park Cemetery (41TV1755) in the course of any
future expansion of Evergreen Cemetery, the current investigation combines
historical research and archeological reconnaissance of the project area to
establish the history of the property and to delineate any extant cultural
resources. The historical research involved searching the Travis County deed
and plat records for information concerning the property ownership in order to
establish metes and bounds and plat records that could provide insight into the
relative location of the areas utilized for burial within the project area and the
dates of use. This research was supplemented with a search for any records at
the Austin History Center, particularly Austin city council minutes, pertaining to
the establishment of the Highland Park Cemetery and the purchase of the
property. Additional background research for this project was conducted using
the THC’s Online Sites Atlas, existing reports, and aerial photographs. At the
request of the THC, oral histories were collected regarding the cemetery as a
component of the TAC Permit. Oral history was primarily provided by Dale Flatt
of Save Austin Cemeteries, who generously shared with us information he had
gathered from contact with several local individuals involved in the daily
operation of the cemetery and at local funeral homes. Hicks & Company
contacted Dale Flatt’s informants and inquired with local churches and civic
organizations for additional leads, but no additional information was gathered.
The results of the archival and oral history research are presented where
appropriate in the Historical Context and Results of the Reconnaissance
Survey sections.
In a TAC Permit application dated November 12, 2008, Hicks & Company
archeologists proposed to conduct a 100% archeological reconnaissance of the
project area in addition to archival research in order to identify and record any
archeological remains associated with Highland Park Cemetery or other
potential historic or prehistoric occupations of the project area. In addition, the
survey was meant to document any other forms of activity that may have
impacted the area’s potential for cultural resources. Because this investigation
is being conducted as a feasibility study, prior to the finalization of any
construction plans, subsurface investigations were not utilized at this stage.
Instead the proposed survey methodology called for intensive surface inspection
of the proposed project area using pedestrian transects spaced at five meter
intervals in order to locate any remaining burial markers or other cultural
resources on the surface. Materials encountered in the field were thoroughly
documented, but not collected. Diagnostic artifacts observed in the field were
photographed and/or sketched then returned. All identified grave markers or
other archeological features that were encountered, including previously
recorded ones, were documented in notes, mapped using sub-meter GPS
technology, photographed, and then combined with additional archival research,
including census records, to better document the boundaries of the Highland
Park cemetery. Any other cultural resources identified within the project area,
but not a component of the cemetery, were recorded as well. The results of the
archeological reconnaissance are presented in the Results of the
Reconnaissance Survey section.

Historical Context

HISTORICAL CONTEXT
The proposed project area is located in the northeastern portion of a 16.035-acre
tract of land that was originally part of Outlot 25 of Division B of Government
Lots of the COA before it was purchased by the Stiles family sometime in the
1870s. Today the property is owned by the COA and has been partially
developed as Sections F and G of Evergreen Cemetery. Prior to its current use,
however, the property was platted as the Highland Park Cemetery, and was used
as such during the 1890s and the early twentieth century. This section
discusses the history of property in relation to its use as Highland Park
Cemetery until the mid-1920s and through its current use as a section of
Evergreen Cemetery. Copies of many of the documents described in the text are
presented in Appendix C.

HIGHLAND PARK CEMETERY (1891-1925)
In the 1890s, the COA requested proposal for the establishment of a new city
cemetery. In 1891, two proposals were submitted to the City for consideration
(City of Austin City Council Minutes 4/6/1891, Pg. 103-104; Appendix C). The
first was by The Young Men’s Real Estate and Investment Company and the
second, from Mrs. Maggie Stiles. On April 6, 1891, the cemetery committee
determined that the proposal from Maggie Stiles was “most advantageous to the
city, and would therefore recommend that the same be accepted” (City of Austin
City Council Minutes 4/6/1891, Pg. 103; Appendix C). According to the
proposal set forth by Maggie Stiles, the cemetery would be within Outlots 24 and
25 of Division B in the City Austin, an area that was approximately 60 acres in
size. Of these 60 acres, 10 acres were guaranteed for the exclusive burial of
paupers. The remaining 50 acres were reserved for use by the owners as a
cemetery following the existing laws and ordinances of the city. Subsequently,
the Highland Park Cemetery Association was chartered by Edmund P. Stiles, E.
C. Bartholomew, Z. T. Fulmore, Walter Tips, and N. E. Shelly to establish and
operate the public cemetery as proposed by Maggie Stiles (Highland Park
Cemetery Association Charter (1891); Appendix C). On May 18, 1891, the city
council approved the Stiles proposition and moved to draft an accordance (City
of Austin City Council Minutes 5/18/1891, Pg. 129; Appendix C). Following
minor amendments, the city council formally accepted the proposition and
delivered the contract to E.P. Stiles on November 16, 1891 (City of Austin City
Council Minutes 11/16/1891, Pg. 130; Appendix C).
At present a single plat map of the Highland Park Cemetery (Figure 8) is the
only known physical representation of the cemetery (Travis County Plat Records
Vol.1, Pg. 91). The plat map shows the cemetery divided into four sections (B-E)
by roads or pathways with a total of 483 grave plots. It is unclear why there is
no Section A (see below). No surrounding roads or landmarks are shown on the
plat map, and a north arrow is absent, making it hard to orient the plat map to
the existing property. The plat map is described in later documents as
pertaining to the 16.035 acre tract in Outlot 25 that was subsequently bought
by the city, and based on this association it seems likely that what is
represented must pertain to portions of that tract. Given the relatively small
size of the plat area relative to the full 60 acre tract described in the Stiles
proposal, the plat record may be intended to only indicate the space guaranteed
to the city for the burial of paupers or it may represent only a portion of that
space (see below).

Historical Context

Lacking any indicators of scale, location, or orientation, it is very difficult to
define the specific extent of the Highland Park Cemetery included in the historic
plat map on Figure 8. The Principal Investigator asserts that Figure 8, as
depicted in this report, likely matches the general orientation of the lot in which
the cemetery is found (with the north boundary – more specifically northnorthwest - at the top of the page, the south boundary at the bottom, etc.)
because maps most often are oriented with the top of the page corresponding to
north and the overwhelming majority of the writing on the page (beyond the
intricate tree titling) is oriented in portrait. Using that assumption, Figures 9a
and 9b represent various hypothetical orientations of the plat location on the
actual landform using historic maps and aerial photographs. Figure 9a utilizes
a 1969 aerial photograph of the area (see Appendix B) to discern one possible
orientation of the platted cemetery. From the original aerial photograph, very
faint breaks in the dense tree cover in Outlot 25B suggest a road was likely
present at the time the picture was taken. This road forks near the center of the
southwest corner of 25B. The shape, scale, and location of that fork
corresponds to the plat map almost exactly if the map is scaled to an area of
approximately 2.5-3 acres and placed in the southwest corner of the larger
outlot. With this hypothesis, the plat map represents only a portion of the larger
cemetery (estimated at almost exactly a quarter) which could be a reason why at
least Section A is missing. Historic documents, as discussed above, suggest
that this map indeed may only represent a portion of the cemetery. The depicted
scenario roughly fits the landform before it was modified by modern cemetery
operations as depicted in Figure 9b(4) with suggested natural breaks in sections
matching the northern terrace contour and the clearly artificial eastern edge
corresponding to the midpoint of the east-west width of the outlot.
The 483 plots depicted on the map would each measure approximately 220-290
square feet within an area of approximately 2.5-3 acres, suggesting that each
plot actually held multiple burial plots (potentially six or seven if the average
plot size was 40 square feet - 4 x 10 feet). Gene Bagwell (personal
communication), owner of InterCare, the City’s funerary and maintenance
contractor for all of the City’s cemeteries, stated that cemeteries typically utilize
20 x 20-foot (400 square foot) plots and that each plot can accommodate 8-12
burials. The plots depicted on the scaled maps would therefore be
approximately 30 percent smaller than what would typically be offered,
suggesting two disparate alternatives: 1) these were plots for paupers who may
have been more closely buried in smaller individual plots or; 2) the plots
accommodated fewer individuals in larger, presumably higher-priced individual
burials. The map’s location on a high terrace, a preferred locale, would suggest
the latter. Using standard 40-square-foot individual burial sizes, the area on
this hypothesis equates to a depicted capacity of roughly 2,900-3,000
individuals, however more- or less-closely-spaced interments could increase or
decrease that number accordingly. Considering the approximate number of
burials known within Evergreen Cemetery (approximately 12,000), this capacity
of projected burials would be reasonable given the space projected. If this
orientation is correct, many of the finds from the current survey (see Results of
the Reconnaissance Survey), including the previously-surveyed elements of
Highland Park Cemetery (Jones and Irruegas 1995) would be outside of the
mapped area, though the 1907-1908 Fowler grave would be within Section C.
Figure 9b includes several orientation hypotheses based upon historic
topographic indicators. Using the 1958 (a date before Outlot 25B was actively
incorporated into Evergreen Cemetery – see below) US Geological Survey Austin
East topographic quadrangle as a base, the plat map fits very well within Outlot

Reconnaissance Survey – Proposed Evergreen Cemetery Expansion – July 2010

Historical Context

25B if expanded to occupy an area of approximately 10 acres (Figure 9b(2)).
This still does not account for the entire Outlot 25B (again providing a reason
that Section A is not depicted), but it covers more of the available area while very
closely matching the topographic contours. However, this hypothesis leaves a
prominent gap in the outlot’s southwest corner that would otherwise be
useable. When rotated clockwise 90 degrees the map (Figure 9b(3)) still fits very
well topographically if kept at roughly the same scale but Section E must extend
beyond the Outlot boundary, making this scenario unlikely. When this scale is
reduced to fit within Outlot 25B, the depicted boundaries no longer match any
of the topography of the landform, making this hypothesis also unlikely. If
depicted at approximately 10 acres in size, each plot would measure
approximately 900 square feet or have room for roughly 22-23 individual burial
plots (with an average burial plot of 40 square feet). This equates to a depicted
capacity of approximately 10,700 individuals. This number is very high given
the population of the City of Austin (22,200 in 1900) at the time the cemetery
was in use (Austin History Center 2010). If this orientation is correct, it would
place the headstones associated with Highland Park Cemetery and previously
recorded by Jones and Irruegas (1995) in Section E of the cemetery and the
1907-1908 Fowler family grave in the middle of Section C (see Results of the
Reconnaissance Survey).
It is the researcher’s opinion that the former, aerial photograph-based,
orientation scenario (Figure 9a) is the most accurate. Considering overall size,
the depicted capacity relative to the current scale of the cemetery and its
correspondence with various topographic and artificial boundaries, the 3-acresized map appears to be the most likely. However, other orientations, even
beyond those depicted as alternates in this volume, are also possible.
Conclusively demonstrating the actual location of the mapped Highland Park
Cemetery is beyond the scope of this investigation and is, for all intents and
purposes, impossible without significant physical investigations of that area.
Archival research found only limited records of 163 interments beginning in
August 1891 and continuing through December of 1893 (Appendix D). It is
important to note, however, that the City of Austin did not record burials at
private cemeteries at that time and only kept records of City-sponsored pauper
burials (Dale Flatt personal communication September 2009).
Based on
interment list data from 1891-1893, for which information on the race of the
individual is given, the cemetery served a primarily African American population
(n=95), with a small number of white (n=33) and Hispanic (n=23) individuals
buried there. Given the lack of records, it is unclear to what degree the cemetery
was used after the early 1890s. During the sale of property to the COA by the
Stiles family in 1955, it was estimated that the cemetery functioned until
approximately 1925, and that no more than 500 burials were present (City of
Austin City Council Minutes 2/9/1955; Appendix C). As described in a
previous report (Jones and Iruegas 1995) and the Results of the
Reconnaissance Survey section that follows, at least one headstone records a
1894 burial, another the 1907 and 1908 deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Fowler, and one
a possible 1913 burial, all of which confirm ongoing use of the property as
cemetery beyond the period of time for which records are currently known to
exist. There is, however, currently no data to provide an accurate assessment of
how many more burials were undertaken within the grounds of Highland Park
Cemetery. According to information provided during the purchase of this
property by the City of Austin in 1955, the use of the Highland Park Cemetery
grounds as a cemetery appears to cease after 1925. This appears to be a direct

consequence of the purchase of the adjoining tract of land on the west for the
establishment of Evergreen Cemetery (Travis Co. Deed Records, Vol. 1688, Pg.
421).

EVERGREEN CEMETERY (1925 TO PRESENT)
In 1925 the COA purchased a 15-acre tract of land adjacent to, and west of, the
16-acre Highland Park Cemetery tract (Travis County Deed Records Vol. 381, Pg.
319). The city purchased the western property from D. V. Pickle in November of
1925 for the price of $5,500. Together these two properties were described as
Outlot 25 of Division B of the Government Outlots adjoining the City of Austin,
and half of the original 60-acre property that was approved for use as Highland
Park Cemetery in 1891. There are no back references to when D. V. Pickle
obtained the land from the Stiles family, and it can be assumed that his
ownership of this property is a strong indication that it was never developed for
the purpose of a cemetery as originally proposed by the Highland Park Cemetery
Association. After the 15-acre tract was purchased, the land was developed as
Evergreen Cemetery, a city operated cemetery that was conceived specifically for
Austin’s African-American community. Officially, Evergreen Cemetery began
operating in 1926. The opening of Evergreen Cemetery seems to have coincided
with the termination of use of the old Highland Park Cemetery property for
burials.
Evergreen Cemetery was being developed and slowly expanded after the 1920’s,
however, no information is available about the use of the Highland Park
Cemetery tracts until the 1950s. On the 30th of April, 1956, the eastern half of
Outlot 25 that had been platted as Highland Park Cemetery was also bought by
the City of Austin (Travis County Deed Records Vol. 1688, Pg. 417), in order to
permit the expansion of Evergreen Cemetery. Aerial photographs of the property
beginning in 1969 show the eastern half of Outlot 25 to be completely overgrown
with trees and scrub, and no significant actions appear to have been taken to
develop the property until the 1970s (Appendix B). Development likely began
shortly after the city took action to vacate the Highland Park Cemetery plat in
1975 (Travis County Deed Records Vol. 5241, Pg. 1269). The aerial photographs
(Appendix B) show that by 1978, the upper terrace, where Evergreen Sections F
and G are now located, had been cleared of trees and roads had been
constructed. By 1981 the roads were better defined and the northern portions
of the upper terrace had clearly been modified by the addition of large amounts
of fill and the upper terrace extended. By 1984 the current fill terraces appear
to have generally taken their current shape, though dumping continues.

RESULTS OF THE RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY
The archeological survey of the project area was conducted by Bradford M.
Jones and Matthew Stotts in the course of two partial field days with two brief
revisits. As discussed in the field methodology section, the entire project area
was walked in transects intervals of five meters or less. Heavy vegetation made
this extremely difficult and leaf litter and extensive dumping deposits limited
surface visibility to the extent that it was difficult to accurately assess the
ground surface for depressions that may indicate the location of graves. As
such, investigations focused on recording evidence of disturbance and mapping
the location of the previously recorded grave monuments as well as any new
grave markers that were found in contexts outside the active burial plots of
Evergreen Cemetery. The results of the field investigations verified the extensive
modification of the landscape within the boundaries of the property evident on
historic aerial photographs and identified three new areas with concentrated
grave markers (Groups B-D). Several isolated potential monuments and at least
one apparently intact headstone dating to 1907-1908 were also identified during
the course of the project. Investigators successfully relocated most of the grave
markers described in a 1995 Hicks & Company survey (Group A on Figures 10
and 11) (Jones and Iruegas 1995), though modifications to their interpretations
have been made and are discussed in detail. This section is organized by an
initial discussion of the project area, focusing on the evidence for modifications
to the surface which have impacted the potential to investigate the area for
burials associated with the Highland Park Cemetery and describing a minor
prehistoric component. The succeeding sections describe the four groups (A-D)
of grave monuments encountered during the field work and the “isolated”
markers.

GENERAL OVERVIEW OF SURVEY
The most striking aspect of the proposed project area is the large amounts of fill
that have been dumped off the edge of the upland landform where it slopes
northeast and down into the Tannehill Branch floodplain. The result has been a
reshaping of the natural land surface within the project area that extends the
edge of the upland terrace east and north, as well as creates artificial terraces
overlooking Tannehill Branch, east of a natural drainage (Figures 10 and 11).
Surface inspection showed this fill to extend out at least a meter or more beyond
the current upland landform across the entire project area, and nearly to the
fence marking the cemetery perimeter in the northeast portion. This fill consists
of a combination of spoil dirt from the excavation of grave shafts within
Evergreen Cemetery and potentially elsewhere, as well as large amounts of both
domestic and industrial refuse. Materials regularly observed in the project area
include chunks of asphalt and concrete, large pieces of limestone, street sweeper
brushes, lumber, and all manner of small items such as bottles, cans, clothing,
appliance or furniture pieces, mattress springs and scrap metal (Figure 12).
Trees and brush have also been deposited here.
The depth of fill could not be precisely measured in the context of the current
investigation, but was at least a meter in depth on the middle and lower artificial
fill terraces and potentially several meters deep along the edges of the upland
terrace. The best indication of the potential depth of the fill was an open hole
found in the middle artificial terrace (Figure 13). Within the hole, modern trash
was observed mixed with soil and rock to at least a meter in depth.

Results of Reconnaissance Survey

Though no precise date for the initiation of this dumping practice is currently
available, a review of historic aerial photographs shows that this has been going
on since at least the late 1970s when the upper terrace was developed as an
extension of Evergreen Cemetery (Appendix B). This would coincide with the
period after the original plat of the property was vacated and the area was used
as the expansion site of Evergreen Cemetery.
In addition to late nineteenth and twentieth century materials associated with
the operation of Highland Park and Evergreen Cemeteries, occasional prehistoric
artifacts were observed on the surface during the course of the survey. The
artifacts consisted of chert cobbles that showed evidence of flake removals
suggesting they were tested cobbles, cores, or early stage bifacial tools.
However, given the large amounts of imported fill and the surface context of the
prehistoric artifacts, it is unclear if these are in situ, or have been introduced
into the project area. Regardless, there is little evidence to suggest a significant
prehistoric occupation and the few artifacts observed in the field do not
constitute a significant component to the site.

GROUP A
Group A consists of eleven headstones, footstones, or grave marker fragments
(Figures 10 and 11: A.1 – A.11) found on the surface on the north edge of the
project area overlooking Tannehill Branch. This area is believed to be associated
with the use of the project area as Highland Park Cemetery in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These monuments and fragments
were first recorded during the 1995 Hicks & Company archeological survey (see
Previous Investigations). At that time, reports of eroding human bone in the
creek bank had been made, and the archeologists encountered human remains
eroding from the creek bank as well as stone markers representing what they
interpreted as six adult burials and a possible infant burial. Any potential for
additional burial erosion has since been mitigated by the construction of a large
limestone retaining wall along the creek bank.
When this area was revisited in 2008, all previously recorded grave markers
were relocated and re-recorded, except for a reported potential infant burial.
According to Jones and Iruegas (1995:20) this identification was predicated on
the observation of two cobbles set in such a manner that they were believed to
mark an infant grave. Though not marked on the map, the infant burial was
assumed by the current investigators to be in the location of a headstone and
footstone shown on Figure 8 of their report north of a tombstone and footstone
(see Figure 7 and A.1 and A.2 on Figure 14 in this report). Several large
cobbles were observed on the surface in the general vicinity, however, cobbles of
this kind were frequently observed in the project area, and we are currently
unable to confirm this earlier identification as it may have been disturbed in the
past 13 years. The remaining six burials Jones and Iruegas identified were all
found, though different conclusions regarding the number of burials they
represent as well as their level of integrity are noted below.

Results of Reconnaissance Survey

Figure 14: Unmarked limestone headstone (A.1, in background) and footstone (A.2, in foreground)
found near the toe of lower artificial fill terrace.

The first burial consists of an unmarked limestone headstone (A.1) and an
associated limestone footstone (A.2) (Figure 14). Unlike all the other examples
to be discussed, these are likely to be in situ, and have an orientation and
disposition that suggests they have a high probability of being an intact grave.
The headstone, a roughly shaped limestone block (perhaps broken) is located 75
inches (190 centimeters) west of the footstone, with a bearing of 280 degrees
along the centerline. This gives the grave an approximate east-west orientation
typical of late nineteenth and early twentieth century grave sites.
The second grave marker is a finely carved limestone headstone (A.3) with the
name of Maria Montalvo engraved on the surface (Figure 15). This tombstone is
lying flat on the ground and is obviously not in its original state. According to
the tombstone inscription, which is in Spanish, Maria M. de Montalvo died July
26, 1892 (Mario M.De Montalvo [fa]llecio [J]ulio 26 de 1892). Background
research on Maria Montalvo by Jones and Iruegas (1995:10) identified an Elida
Montala buried at Highland Park Cemetery the day after the death recorded on
the tombstone and plausibly suggested that the two individuals were the same.

Reconnaissance Survey – Proposed Evergreen Cemetery Expansion – July 2010

Results of Reconnaissance Survey

Figure 15: Maria Montalvo headstone (A.3).

During the course of the current investigations, measurements taken of the
Montalvo tombstone and a limestone base (A.4) carved in the same style, but
located 15 meters north of the tombstone (Figure 16), found them to match
perfectly. It is thus the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the Montalvo
headstone (A.3) would have fit into this base (A.4). This discovery has two
implications. First, the number of burials estimated by Jones and Iruegas, who
counted the base as a separate tombstone and grave, is lower by at least one.
Second, the distance separating the base and the headstone suggest that one or
both are not in situ. This indicates that the grave has been disturbed by later
activity such as dumping or clearing of the property, or that the tombstone was
moved by someone at some point. Identifying the location of the actual Montalvo
interment cannot be determined without further subsurface testing.
The suggestion that these grave monuments have been displaced is reinforced
by the presence of a second large limestone base (A.5) block just east of A.4 and
another small limestone base (A.6) lying on the surface next to it (Figures 17
and 18). When observed from the edge of the creek, all of these grave markers
are located in a low drainage. While it is unlikely that there is sufficient force in
the drainage to account for the movement of the stones, it does further raise the
possibility that none of these are in their original location. Much like the
situation described later for Groups B, C, and D, these monuments may in part
be a grouping of disturbed, discarded grave markers. At the current level of
analysis and investigation such a question is unresolvable without further
archeological investigation such as test excavations to identify possible grave
shafts.

Figure 18: Small limestone headstone base or marker (A.6).

West of the Montalvo base (A.4), is a third concentration of five limestone grave
monuments (A.7-A.11), including two limestone headstones (A.7 and A.11) and
several fragments of cut and carved limestone. The westernmost example is a
large rectangular limestone headstone (A.7; Figure 19) fractured into two pieces
and engraved with the following information in Spanish: Albina Mendoza
[F]allecio en [e]l ano 1894 F.ro 5th (Albina Mendoza died February 5th in the year
1894). Previous research by Iruegas and Jones (1995:12) was able to identify an
Alvina Mendosa in the 1891 Austin City Directory, but no later records of this
individual were identified. The headstone is lying on its side and the lower
portion, which has broken off, is lying adjacent to it. The second tombstone or
monument is an ornately carved limestone marker (A.11) with a square base
that becomes a sextagonal pillar that tapers toward the top (Figure 20). The
uppermost portions are broken off. There are several instances of incised or
engraved letters and numbers on the tapering shaft, but it is difficult to discern
what they mean or to verify their intent to commemorate an associated
interment. The most legible and likely relevant engraving is “S S 1913”. If this
engraving references the initials and date of death of an individual, it would
verify an additional interment not recorded in any of the consulted documents
within the period that Highland Park Cemetery was being operated. The
remaining three limestone fragments are scattered between the two monuments
and are generally similar – all are fragmented rectangular limestone slabs with
no apparent markings - but each has varying dimensions (Figure 21). It is not
certain if these represent portions of a single broken monument or three broken
but distinct monuments, or if they represent additional components of the two
headstones.
Without additional archeological investigation, it remains
uncertain if the monuments described comprise the remains of intact
interments, or are displaced. The discovery of human remains within the creek
bank adjacent to this set of monuments and fragments is a strong argument
that these do mark actual burials.
However, it has not been positively
demonstrated whether the human remains in the creek bank are associated
with the monuments or represent different additional historic burials or even

In summary, the various tombstone fragments found in Group A together
comprise the only grave monuments that could be clearly associated with the
Highland Park Cemetery. The general dates represented on the tombstones
correspond to the earliest years of the cemetery, and though the names do not
perfectly correlate with the available textual evidence, they nonetheless
demonstrate the presence of late nineteenth and early twentieth century
interments in this area. The remaining groups and isolated finds discussed
below (with the exception of the Fowler grave site) are all either equivocal in their
age or are clearly the result of activities associated with Evergreen Cemetery.

GROUP B
Group B is a small area located in the northeast corner of the northernmost
extension of the project area, where unmarked limestone blocks, building
materials and an oval patch of irises was recorded during the survey (see
Figures 10 and 11). The location is accessible by a now overgrown trail that
parallels the chain link fence that marks the cemetery perimeter. On a 1981
aerial photograph (Appendix B, Figure B.3) the now overgrown trail is more
visible, indicating it may have been the period which saw active dumping in this
location. Today, much of the area is overgrown with various trees and shrubs,
and modern trash is found scattered across the slopes up to the edge of the
upland terrace where Section D of Evergreen Cemetery is located. When
compared with the proposed orientation for the Highland Cemetery Plat map,
Group B is clearly outside of the platted area.

Reconnaissance Survey – Proposed Evergreen Cemetery Expansion – July 2010

23

Results of Reconnaissance Survey

The material observed in Group B consisted of seven rectangular limestone
blocks, construction debris (bricks, roofing material, and a concrete slabs), and
an oval iris patch approximately one meter in diameter (Figures 22 and 23).
The seven limestone blocks appear to be uncarved and are possibly blank
headstones or monument components that, given their apparent lack of
organization and their general disposition, are out of place.
The most
parsimonious explanation for the presence of these items in this area is that
they were dumped here during the operation of Evergreen Cemetery. The high
density of roofing material and brick could potentially be related to the
demolition of a small structure during the platting and subdivision of Section D
of Evergreen Cemetery (near the southwest corner).

Figure 23: Roughly meter wide patch of irises found just south of limestone blocks.

The roughly oval iris patch is intriguing, but undefined as to its purpose (see
Figure 23). Irises are common in late nineteenth and twentieth century
cemeteries, but they are also common to house plantings. While the patch
could indicate a burial, it could also correspond to the house debris found to its
north. Pending additional excavation or remote sensing, the potential for the
spot to mark a grave is unknown. However, should any future development of
the cemetery directly impact this area, further testing of the iris patch would be
prudent to determine that no unmarked graves are present.

GROUP C
Group C is a collection of five burial markers located among the trees near the
edge of the upland terrace east of East Main Drive within the cemetery grounds.
This area does not appear to have been part of the original plat of the Highland
Park Cemetery. The five markers (C.1-C.5; see Figures 10, 11, and 24-27) are
a mix of granite, marble, and limestone headstones and a metal plaque
pertaining to five different individuals who died between 1935 and 1982. Based
on the dates, the markers should all be associated with the operation of the
Evergreen Cemetery and are not directly related to Highland Park Cemetery.
With the exception of the Elizabeth Jones marker (C.1) sitting alone to the
northeast of the other four, the markers are placed closely together. Given their
spatial and relational orientation, all the markers appear to represent a discard
pile from the cemetery. As none of the markers are visibly damaged, the reason
for their placement here is uncertain, but it seems very unlikely to have to do
with the location of any actual burials. Nonetheless, limited mechanical testing
of the upper terrace in this area would be prudent to ensure that no burial
shafts associated with these or other unmarked graves are present.

GROUP D
Group D consists of a concrete grave marker (D.1), a possible marker fragment
(D.2), and a concrete plot number marker (D.3) on the ground surface in an
eroded area on the east facing slope near the southeast corner of the cemetery.
Compared to the tentative reconstruction of the plat of Highland Park Cemetery,
this portion of the project area would have been located in the southeast
periphery of the cemetery. The ground surface has clearly been modified by the
introduction of fill, and retaining “walls” made of posts or railroad ties were
visible where the soil had eroded. The intact headstone (D.1) is made of cast
concrete with an oval upper section and a circle on the front face created by a
deep ring in the concrete (Figure 28). The marker is otherwise unmarked. A
survey of the cemetery identified at least two other comparable examples. Both
are in Section C of Evergreen Cemetery near Avenue C, and are associated with
headstones dating from the early 1950s through the early 1970s. These
headstones are also unmarked, and are likely to be generic markers available for
the families of the deceased to use. Across Evergreen Cemetery, concrete plot
markers comparable to the one observed during the survey of this portion of the
project area (D.3) were also found intact (Figure 29). It is unclear if this marker
is out of place or marks an actual plot location. Overall, based on comparison
with comparable examples within Evergreen Cemetery, the items comprising
Group D are all believed to post-date the operation of Highland Park Cemetery

Evergreen Cemetery.

ISOLATED FINDS
In addition to the four areas of concentrated grave monuments previously
discussed, a 1907-1908 grave site was found within Section F of Evergreen
Cemetery (outside of the project area) and two isolated grave monument
fragments were found within the project area. The 1907-1908 grave site is
notable for being the only clear instance of an intact headstone within the
original plat of Highland Park Cemetery that has been incorporated into
Evergreen Cemetery. The grave site is for Mr. Samuel F. and Mrs. Lettie Fowler
(Figure 30). No data on these individuals was found in either the U.S. Federal
Census of Texas or in the New Handbook of Texas History. The headstone is an
elaborate marble or granite marker modeled in the shape of logs of wood, and
provided to members of the Woodsmen of the World organization. Small stone
tree stumps act as foot stones. These markers were given to members of the
organization through the 1920s. As the death dates on the headstone predate
the establishment of Evergreen Cemetery, there is a strong likelihood that this
grave site was a late addition to Highland Park Cemetery. Dale Flatt informed
us that, in conversations with Jim Stasswender of Austin Memorial Arts, he
remembered encountering this headstone in the woods prior to the use of the
area as an extension of Evergreen Cemetery.
What is curious, if this area was actively used for burials during the period
during which Highland Park Cemetery was in operation, is the lack of additional
grave markers dating to this period in this area. It begs the question as to
whether the headstone was perhaps relocated here, or if it was the only burial

placed in this portion of the old Highland Park Cemetery. Employees of
Intercare, who are responsible for digging grave shafts in Sections F and G of
Evergreen Cemetery, reported to both Dale Flatt and Hicks & Company
archeologists that no human remains or evidence of earlier burials have been
observed in this portion of the cemetery. This suggests there may have been few
if any burials on the upper terrace, or alternately, that they have been destroyed
or buried as a result of the development of this portion of the property.
The first isolated find is a probable fragment of a limestone headstone base
(I.F.1, Figure 31). It was located on the surface of the middle artificial fill
terrace and had no discernible associations with other monuments. The second
isolated find (I.F.2, Figure 32) is a large limestone block that has been roughly
worked to be rectangular. It was found on the surface in the drainage on the
western edge of the artificial fill terraces. It shows none of the fine finishing
work typical of most tombstones, and it is unclear if this is a grave monument or
simply a large limestone block that was dumped in the project area. As neither
of these objects had written inscriptions, and neither could be satisfactorily
dated, it is uncertain to what degree they may represent dumping of more recent
material, or are dislocated fragments of markers associated with Highland Park
or Evergreen Cemeteries.

41TV1755 – HIGHLAND PARK CEMETERY DISCUSSION
The proposed Evergreen Cemetery expansion project area is located within the
16-acre tract in which the historic Highland Park Cemetery was platted. This
tract accounts for only a quarter of the original 60 acres originally proposed for
use as a cemetery by the Highland Park Cemetery Association, but given the
lack of evidence at present for burials outside this tract, the current site
boundary has only been established within the 16 acre tract (see Figure 1).
While the historical documents and archeological investigations indicate that
Highland Park Cemetery was most likely located somewhere within this 16-acre
tract. There is currently only limited evidence for intact grave sites associated
with the cemetery within the project area or the tract. Using historic aerial
photography and topographic maps, some alternatives of the historic cemetery
plats have been presented in Figures 9a and 9b. The three-acre-scaled map
generated from aerial photographs (Figure 9a) appears to fit in with visible
landmarks, the general scale of the site, the number of burials available,
topography, etc., however, InterCare employees have stated that they have never
encountered any indications of previous interments in these areas. Additionally,
reconnaissance survey found evidence of Highland Park-era burials in two
locations on the tract (Group A and the Fowler grave), but only the Fowler family
site actually lies within this hypothesized mapped location. Group A, a
collection of more numerous, and older features, is found beyond the depicted
boundary. This situation can likely be attributed to several factors. First, as
originally platted, there were a total of 483 plots laid out within the cemetery but
each plot can hole multiple burials (8-12). There is circumstantial evidence
given by members of the Stiles family in 1956 that that many burials were
actually interred in the property. According to the documents recording the
decision to buy the property by the COA, no more than 500 burials were said to
have interred here. Currently the historical and archeological records can only
confirm that less than 200 individuals were actually interred, suggesting much
of the land set aside for Highland Park Cemetery was probably never used
however, at the time of its use as Highland Park, the City only kept records of
pauper burials. Additional, paid-for burials are unaccounted for.
The role of Highland Park Cemetery as a location for pauper burials also
presents additional difficulty in identifying the location of any graves. Assuming
that many of the individuals buried here were not supplied with durable stone
markers, but rather wooden ones or later metal plaques, the lack of more
evidence may in part be attributed to poor preservation, particularly as the
cemetery appears to have not been maintained after the early 1900s.
Furthermore, this emphasis on the role of the cemetery for the burial of paupers
may suggest that within the cemetery, certain sectors were more heavily used
than others. For example the location of Group A on low ground near Tannehill
Branch with a high potential for flooding, may have been a location for pauper
burials. In contrast the site of the Fowler grave, safe from flooding on the higher
upland terrace, may have been in an area reserved for wealthier customers.
Unfortunately too little data exists on the individuals associated with late
nineteenth and early twentieth century headstones to make a more refined
argument at this stage.
Finally, the extensive dumping and modification of the landscape is the most
obvious impediment to identifying the location of any Highland Park Cemetery
burials. Within the proposed project area it will remain uncertain to what

Reconnaissance Survey – Proposed Evergreen Cemetery Expansion – July 2010

32

Results of Reconnaissance Survey

degree (if any) burials are presently deeply buried under fill without significant
excavation. Given the presence of late nineteenth century grave monuments at
the edge of the fill, it seems possible that more graves would be found south of
Group A under the fill. On the upper terrace, where the Fowler grave was found,
it remains unclear if the clearing of the land and possible introduction of fill for
use as Sections F and G of Evergreen Cemetery have resulted in the destruction
or burial of grave markers.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of the historical and archeological investigations, the
proposed project area is potentially situated within what were once the grounds
of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Highland Park Cemetery. It
remains unclear how much of the proposed project area, or the larger 60-acre
tract originally proposed for use as a cemetery by the Highland Park Association
was actually used for that purpose. Given the location of the late nineteenth
and early twentieth century graves in Group A in the northeast portion of the
proposed project area, and the presence of the Fowler grave site on the upper
terrace within Section F of Evergreen Cemetery, the upland terrace and slopes
south of Tannehill Branch have the highest potential for encountering intact late
nineteenth and early twentieth century graves associated with the Highland
Park Cemetery. However, the use of the proposed project area for trash and fill
dumping has resulted in the severe modification of the original surface in the
project area, limiting the utility of current archeological investigations.
Consequently, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that, once it has
been determined, further archeological and historical investigations are
warranted prior to the beginning of construction to formally identify the
expansion area’s potential impacts to historic remnants of Highland Park
Cemetery. Recommendations for such investigations are as follows:
1.

Prior to the initiation of additional field investigations, a more robust oral
and archival historical study should be conducted. Such investigations
should focus on identifying any individuals who may remember the
cemetery, or who worked in the location of Highland Park Cemetery after
it was acquired by the COA, in order to collect potential data on the
location of interments that are no longer visible and to better delineate
the historical transformations of the project area as a result of the
Evergreen Cemetery expansion.

2.

Additional systematic mechanical excavations in the proposed expansion
area, particularly where no grave monuments have been previously
located or fill has effectively obscured the original late nineteenth/early
twentieth century ground surface to investigate for signs of intact burials
and to identify the late nineteenth/early twentieth century ground
surface.

Hicks & Company further recommends that any expansion of the cemetery or
other ground-disturbing activity in any direction beyond that actively being used
should be preceded with cultural resource coordination and (if determined
necessary) additional archival and/or field investigations.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC reconnaissance survey permit
#5075. All project-related photographs and documents will be curated at TARL.

Transcriptions of City of Austin Documents Pertaining to the Purchase and
Vacation of the 16 acre Stiles Tract
Amendment – February 9, 1955
Arthur A. Stiles and his sister Margaret Stiles have agreed to sell their property on the
north side of E. 12th Street immediately east of Evergreen Cemetery to the City for
$250.00 an acre. This tract contains 16.035 acres of land which ill make the purchase
price $4008.75.
“This property was placed on record some fifty or sixty years ago as the Highland Park
Cemetery and was used as a cemetery up to about thirty years ago. However, according
to information we have received from Mr. Stiles, we have estimated that there are not
more than 500 graves in the entire tract.”
Motion was carried to purchase the land.
