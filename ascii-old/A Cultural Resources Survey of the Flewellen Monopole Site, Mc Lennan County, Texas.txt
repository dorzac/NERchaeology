Report #318
July 2014

Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of a proposed monopole
tower in central McLennan County, Texas. The Federal Communications Commission’s
Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources
survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required, but
subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided by the Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeology Division. The total area to be impacted is 800 square feet (<0.02
acres).
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on July 18, 2014. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before two shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in either of the shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Acknowledgments
The individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to the successful
planning, organization, and completion of this project are Ms. Jayne Aaron, Architectural
Historian and Senior Environmental Planner at AARCHER, Inc., and Mr. Bill Martin, Federal
Programs Reviewer at the Texas Historical Commission’s Office of Historic Preservation.

involved in the proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In July 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or within one
mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural resources
to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area

Project Environment
The Project Area lies within the central portion of Mc Lennan County, within the Grand Prairie
and Blackland Prairie ecoregions, typified by an undulating landscape with few wooded areas, and
underlain by Cretaceous-aged limestone, shale, and clay deposits (Barnes 1970; Miller and
Greenwade 2001; Smyrl 1996).
Physiographically, the region falls along the Northeast margin of the Edwards Plateau region of
the Great Plains province (Fenneman 1931). Elevation in McLennan county ranges from 400 feet
to 850 feet above mean sea level. The Balcones Fault splits the county from the southwest to the
northeast. The Middle and South Bosque rivers drain into the Brazos River basin from the west,
and Tehuacana and Aquilla creeks drain into the basin from the east. More pertinent, the
proposed Flewellen Monopole site is situated less than a mile from the Brazos River.
The modern climate of the Flewellen Monopole area is classified as subtropical, with an average
annual rainfall of about 33 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year,
with average daily maximum temperatures averaging about 97 degrees in July, to around 37
degrees in January. The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in
frequent droughts as well as periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of
roughly 253 days (Smyrl 1996).
Soils
As shown in Figure 4, the Flewellen Monopole is to be constructed on the cusp of Bastsil fine
sandy loam (BaA) and Westwood silty loam (Wd). Bastsil fine sandy loam is commonly found
on nearly level to slightly rolling Pleistocene-age terraces along the Brazos River. A typical soil
pedon of Bastsil fine sandy loam consists of reddish brown fine sandy loam in the upper 9 inches,
red sandy clay loam from 9 to 27 inches, reddish yellow sandy clay loam from 27 to 62 inches,
and reddish yellow sandy clay loam from 62 to 80 inches below the surface.
Westwood silty loam is slightly younger than Bastsil fine sandy loam. Westwood is prevalent on
Holocene-age terrace deposits along the Brazos. A typical soil pedon of Westwood silty loam
consists of reddish brown silty loam in the upper 6 inches, reddish brown silty loam from 6 to 18
inches, yellowish red silty clay loam from 18 to 44 inches, and reddish yellow silty loam from 44
to 80 inches below the surface (Miller and Greenwade 2001; Websoil Survey Online 2014).

Cultural Chronology
The location of the Flewellen Monopole survey area presumes cultural affinities both indigenous
to the northwestern edge of the north-central Texas region as well as intrusive influences from
the Southern Great Plains (Figure 5). Several scholars have offered sound but differing arguments
for cultural chronologies for the Southern Great Plains extending into northern Texas. The
cultural chronology, defined by complex (in lieu of the terms phase, interval, or period) of the
North American High Plains has been synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and more recently,
the Southern High Plains in Texas by Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd (1995). It should
be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in climatic conditions and
subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of change in central and
south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Johnson and Holliday (1986,
1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate and given as years
before present (B.P.).

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may
have inhabited the
landscape before 11,500
B.P, solid evidence does
not support their
existence. Although
human behavior is
inferred on stone
artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site
(Fox et al. 1992:51-73),
all are problematic. At
Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of
north-central Texas,
r a d i o carbon d a t e s
initially believed to be
from burned charcoal in
human campfires, and
approximating an
antiquity of 40,000 years
were later disproved as
dates on natural coal Figure 5. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
( S t a n f o r d Black 1989a).
1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic
proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on
stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and
with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances
of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains
were occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people
who made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented
the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
5

bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called "Goshen" may be present (Hofman 1989:34; Irwin et al. 1973).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in
Bell County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940),
archaeological evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either
extinct or otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano
Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of
megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic
hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas,
such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the
inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals which would produce the same
amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile
points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the area was used more frequently in the
6

Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of bison and other
game animals on the Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that population densities
were low during this period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
"few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse
utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and
lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285).
Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains
decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation
of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black
1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt
this conclusion (e.g., Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock
middens are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach
and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological
community, but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
7

Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about
4500 B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites,
at least in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or
fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of
burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the
Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32
(Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens
at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County
(Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in
diameter were still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have
become less specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base
(Black 1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains
area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the
Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt
(1980) further posits that population in the Taylor County area peaked during the Late Archaic
with groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found
in the region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points. The most common are
Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011), both of which are short, triangular points with side
notches. The Frio point also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).

Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt
(1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's
(1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes,
which also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.

8

Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period,
including the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central
Texas and the northern South Texas Plain (Black 1989b:32; Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes
following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from
about 2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts
into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977;
Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into
the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to
Hurt (1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is
mirrored in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due
to the increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited
European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The
cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence
of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos
and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed
in many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975;
Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan
Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989;
Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on
the Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).

9

A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the Flewellen Monopole site had not been subjected
to a cultural resources survey (Atlas 2014). As shown in Figure 3, the closest cultural resources
surveys were conducted by Prewitt and Associates archaeologists in 2003 and 2008 along the
Brazos River, but resulting in the discovery of no archaeological sites. However, neighborhood
surveys to the southeast of the Project Area in East Waco revealed several historic structures that
were potential eligible as historically significant structures. The only recognized National Register
Property within one mile of the Flewellen Monopole is the John Wesley Mann House. Otherwise,
four historic markers situated within one mile include the Bagby House, Governor Patrick Morris
Neff’s House, the A. J. Moore High School, and the Greenwood Cemetery.
As of July 29, 2014 there were 301 documented archaeological sites in McLennan County, and
together they begin to convey a glimpse of how the landscape may have been exploited over the
past several millennia in the area. It is evident that humans have lived in the area from the
Paleoindian period, perhaps as long ago as 11,500 years ago.
Many of these 301 sites were documented in the 1930s thru the 1960s by legendary
archaeologists W. H. Dietz, Frank Watt, and Al Redder. Until Texas Antiquity codes and rules
provided new guidelines for cultural resources investigations to be a part of development on
public lands, or development funded with public tax dollars in the 1970s, these gentlemen often
contributed their own individual efforts to document sites in McLennan County. Accordingly,
with the enactment of a Texas Antiquities code, many more archaeological sites have been
recorded in McLennan County, beginning in the 1980s.
Of the 301 sites, 116 are prehistoric open campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian through
the early Historic periods. Notably, more than a few of these sites have yielded Paleoinidian
artifacts, and on many sites archaeologists have identified evidence of protohistoric and historic
Wichita Indian encampments.
Lithic scatters consisting of chipped stone debitage where Native Americans have not camped,
but have manufactured stone tools from the abundance of lithic raw materials on the surface make
up 71 of the 301 documented archaeological sites in McLennan County. The high cliffs along the
Brazos River and streams in McLennan County provided ideal shelters in rock bluffs. In that
regard, 8 rockshelters used by prehistoric inhabitants have been recorded as archaeological sites.
Prehistoric skeletal human remains have been discovered at three archaeological sites in
10

McLennan County. At one of these, four burials were found in association with obsidian stone
tools and pottery (41ML119). In another, archaeologists excavated a mass burial ground along
the Brazos River with 23 graves (41ML226). Historic burials include 41ML65, where the grave
of a presumably Native American skeleton was unearthed, and an 1800s cemetery was examined
(41ML302).
Historic archaeological sites ranging in age from the 1850s through the 1970s make up the
complement of archaeological sites documented in McLennan County. In total, there were 121
historic components, either as stand alone sites, or as historic components situated on prehistoric
sites. For the most part, they are house sites and farmsteads. Exceptions are jail houses, root
cellars, trash dumps and scatters, wells, cisterns, oil & gas industrial operations, a MexicanAmerican cemetery, etc.
Exceptional sites that have merited State Archeologiocal Landmark (SAL) designation within
McLennan County include:
41MLL118 - a Tonk Creek petroglyph site with a rare example of petroglyphs in north-central
Texas
Waco Suspension Bridge in Waco
1st Street Cemetery in Wabco
McLennan County Courthouse in Waco
Finally, we would be remiss if we did not include the world class Waco Mammoth Site north of
Waco

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

of the backfilled shovel test. Excavation of the shovel tests were terminated at 80 centimeters
below the surface (cmbs).

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The immediate area of the tower footprint area appeared to have been heavily disturbed due to
nearby construction and a channeled drainage. As shown in Figure 7, the immediate area appeared
to have been built up with spoils from elsewhere. Angular limestone fill gravels lying on red clay
hardpan were observed on the surface.
Two shovel tests placed within the tower’s footprint (Figure 8) revealed brown (10YR4/3) sandy
loam with small, soft marl chunks and red clay mottling in the upper 15 cm. Below that, between
15-45 cm was weak red (10R4/3) silty loam, underlain by reddish brown (10YR5/3) silty loam
from 45-80 cmbs.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the Project
Area was conducted, and two shovel tests were excavated, but no evidence of neither prehistoric
nor historic occupation was found. Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as
currently designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect”
on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds
are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant,
and by the Texas Historical Commission.
