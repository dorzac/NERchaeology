Abstract
On August 11-13 and 19, 2009, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) of Texas State UniversitySan Marcos performed an intensive and systematic archaeological survey of an approximately 101acre parcel, located in Williamson County, Texas, on behalf of the Texas State Round Rock Higher
Education Center (RRHEC). Although no direct impacts to the project area are immediately imminent,
RRHEC intends to continue expanding the campus in coming years to meet expected growing
enrollment demands of students in the north-Austin area, and therefore, the archaeological survey was
entirely proactive and voluntary for RRHEC. As a political subdivision of the State of Texas, foreseen
development by RRHEC is subject to provisions of the Texas Antiquities Code. Work was carried out
by the authors, Jon C. Lohse, who served as Principal Investigator, and David M. Yelacic, serving as
Project Archaeologist, and CAS Field Archaeologists, Sarah Scogin and Julian A. Sitters, under the
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5338.
Pedestrian survey and shovel test excavations showed that a majority of the project area has
been impacted by recent and/or current agricultural practices. However, one historic site, an early- to
mid-twentieth century tenant farmstead, 41WM1247, was identified and recorded appropriately. Site
41WM1247 does not appear to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, State Archeological
Landmark, or Recorded Texas Historic Landmark status, and therefore, CAS recommends that no
further investigations of the site are warranted. Should RRHEC propose future development and
expansion of the campus, it is recommended that permission be granted to proceed.

Introduction

Antiquities Permit No. 5338 issued by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) to Dr. Jon C. Lohse,
Principal Investigator. Cultural resources located
on land owned or controlled by the State of Texas
or its political subdivisions are protected by the
TAC (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9,
Chapter 191), which identifies significant sites as
State Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). Should
any historic or prehistoric sites located on land
that is designated for impact during development
be determined eligible for formal designation of
landmark status under the TAC, some measure
of protection or mitigation of impact may be
necessary. The formal designation of SALs and
their administration is the responsibility of the
THC.

On 11-13 and 19 August, 2009, the Center
for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State
University-San Marcos performed an intensive
archaeological survey of an approximately 101acre parcel, located in Williamson County, Texas.
This land comprises the Round Rock Higher
Education Center (RRHEC), part of the Texas
State University system. RRHEC has already
constructed a limited number of buildings on
the property, and intends to continue expanding
the campus in coming years to meet expected
growing enrollment demands of students in the
north-Austin area. In order to more efficiently
and proactively manage this intended growth,
RRHEC is seeking to compile an inventory
of historic and/or prehistoric archaeological
sites that might be present in the area. Future
constructions can then be planned in the context
of known cultural resources, and any sites that
are determined to be potentially significant in
local, state, or national history or prehistory can
be addressed in an informed and conscientious
manner. CAS conducted this survey on behalf of
the RRHEC to assist them with future regulatory
compliance obligations. No immediate impacts
to the campus property are imminent; the
archaeological survey was entirely proactive and
voluntary.

The TAC generally requires that a
complete archaeological survey be performed
in conjunction with projects that fall under its
purview, particularly in previously unsurveyed
areas and in settings where cultural resources
are expected. Any resources determined to be
significant must then be avoided, protected, or
their destruction mitigated by approved data
recovery programs. Worthiness for designation
as a SAL is defined in the TAC:
Archaeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as
State Archaeological Landmarks, provided that
at least one of the following conditions is met
(Rules and Practice, Chapter 41:10):

RRHEC’s use of funds issued from State
of Texas for campus development projects
categorizes projects as undertakings subject
to provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas
(TAC). The TAC requires that these and similar
developments be proceeded by archaeological
assessments to determine the presence and
potential nature of cultural resources that
would be impacted by proposed developments.
Accordingly, this work was carried out under

Project Area Setting

(b) The majority of artifacts are in place
so that a significant portion of the site’s
original characteristics can be defined through
investigation; and/or

The current project area is centrally
located in southern Williamson County,
Texas, approximately 1.5 kilometers east of the
northern boundary of Round Rock’s extended
territorial jurisdiction, at the intersection of
FM 1460 and University Boulevard (Figure 1).
Physiographically, Williamson County straddles
the Balcones Escarpment, the boundary between
the Blackland Prairie and Edwards Plateau
environmental regions (Figure 2). Transitional
environments such as this, or ecotones, are
markedly high-energy settings capable of
supporting a tremendous amount of biodiversity
(Crumley 1994). Environmental settings, which
may consist of but are certainly not limited
to components including climate, hydrology,
biology, geology, and soil, have an important
role in the attraction of human inhabitants to a
particular locale and subsequent site formation
processes. Accordingly, these factors are
taken into consideration when performing
archaeological research, and they will be defined
for the current project area below.

(c) The site has the potential to contribute
to cumulative cultural history by the addition of
new information; and/or
(d) The site offers evidence of unique or rare
attributes; and/or
(e) The site offers a unique or rare
opportunity to test techniques, theory, or method
of preservation, thereby contributing to scientific
knowledge.
As a result of this survey, one historic site,
41WM1247, a tenant farmstead located in the
southwest corner of the project area, was discovered
and documented. This site is recommended as
ineligible for listing to the National Register
of Historic Places, and not worthy of being
designated as a State Archaeological Landmark.
The site will be described in detail later in this
report. No other cultural deposits, prehistoric or
historic, surface or subsurface, were identified in
the remaining portion of the project area.
Under the short report format set forth by
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and
adopted by the THC, this report provides a brief
overview of the regulatory requirements for this
project (above), defines the project area setting,
provides cultural background, describes the
methods used in gathering data, and presents
results and recommendations. The fieldwork was
performed by the Project Archaeologist, David
M. Yelacic, and CAS archaeologists, Julian A.
Sitters and Sarah Scogin. Jon C. Lohse served as
the Principal Investigator,.

Climate and Weather
Much of Central Texas, including the
project area, falls within the humid subtropical
climatic region, which is characterized by
relatively high seasonal variability with mild
winters and hot summers (Gabler et al. 2007).
Based on data for a 30-year period, 1951-1980,
average monthly temperatures in the vicinity
of the project area range from as cold as 38.8°
F in January to as hot as 95.4° F in July, and
mean annual precipitation measures 31.5 inches
(Bomar 1983). However, precipitation is bimodal
with peaks in late spring (April and May) and late
?

map (Round Rock), and Google Earth Image.

summer to early fall (August and September) due
to a floating interface between dry continental
air and moist air moving inland off of the Gulf
of Mexico (Bomar 1983). Cloud bursts may
unload a relatively high amount of precipitation
on a confined area in a short period of time,
resulting in the area’s tributaries and river levels
to rise rapidly (Woodruff 1979). Additionally,
drought is common to Central Texas; there is
not a decade in the twentieth century that did
not experience drought conditions (Bomar
1983:153). As archaeologists sometimes deal
with subjects predating the measured and written
record, paleoclimates are often extrapolated or
inferred through proxy data and environmental
reconstructions. A synopsis of Central
Texas’ paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental
reconstruction is provided in Flora and Fauna.

Hydrology
Surface water near the project area is limited
to small streams including McNutt Creek and
Chandler Branch, both of which are tributaries
of Brushy Creek. McNutt Creek and Chandler
Branch, as well as the upper portion of Brushy
Creek, are intermittent waterways draining
surface runoff during precipitation events. Brushy
Creek begins in southwestern Williamson County
and flows east for nearly 70 miles to its confluence
with the San Gabriel River in Milam County,
Texas (Tyler 1996:1:788). Central Texas is known
for its rich and diverse archaeological resources,
especially along its waterways and tributaries to
river systems (Collins 2004). One significant site
in particular, Wilson-Leonard, is located along
Brushy Creek not far from the project area and

contains a record of human occupation from at
least ca. 11,500 radiocarbon years before present
to the Late Archaic period (Collins 1998). In
addition to surface water resources, subsurface
water of the Edwards Aquifer issuing forth from
numerous springs has long supported indigenous
occupations (Brune 1981).

the paleoenvironment, reconstructed through
proxy data, is an important consideration of the
archaeologist. The post glacial period, or the past
10,000 years, has generally been marked by a
gradual increase in temperature and aridity, as
indicated by decreasing arboreal (tree) pollen
and increasing herbaceous and grassland variety
pollens in the palynological (i.e., fossil pollen)
record of Central Texas (Bryant and Holloway
1985). However, Bryant and Holloway (1985)
compile evidence from Patschke and Weakley
Bogs, located in the Blackland Prairie in eastern
Central Texas, to show that there was a brief
interval of more mesic or moist conditions
around ca. 2000 BP, indicated by an increase in
arboreal pollen. This brief mesic interval was
then followed by a return to arid-adapted, oaksavannah vegetation at ca. 1500 BP. Additionally,

Flora and Fauna
Vegetation and wildlife are dynamic and
symbiotic entities that react to an equally dynamic
climate through adaptation and/or migration.
Accordingly, vegetation and wildlife present
at a particular geographic location are everchanging, and as archaeology may investigate
subjects predating measured or written records,

exploited by indigenous people, rather, the
availability or exploitation of bison as studied
by Dillehay (1974) and Mauldin et al. (2008)
merely illustrates fluctuating availability of a
wildlife resource. In fact, archaeological sites
across the region have widely varying faunal
assemblages that include aquatic species, avian
species, amphibious species, and small to large
mammalians.

Gould (1962) describes the Blackland Prairie
as currently consisting of flora including little
bluestem, big bluestem, Indian-, switch-, various
grama-, and Texas winter- grasses with stands
of Mesquite, post oak, and blackjack oak trees.
The Edwards Plateau flora is characterized by
switchgrass, various species of bluestems and
gramas, Indiangrass, and wildrye with a brushy
overstory of mesquite, junipers, live oaks, and
shinnery oaks (Gould 1962). Approximately
80% of the project area has been or is being used
as farm land. However, there are three small,
discontinuous areas with stands of trees including
cottonwood, oak, mesquite, and hackberry. As
described later in this document, at least one of
the woody areas was formerly cultivated.

Currently, according to Werchan and
Coker (1983), the major wildlife species found
in Williamson County are white-tailed deer,
wild turkey, fox squirrel, jackrabbit, cottontail,
bobwhite quail, mourning dove, beaver, bobcat,
coyote, fox, nutria, opossum, raccoon, ring-tailed
cat, and skunk. However, as described above,
significant anthropogenic modification of the
landscape within the project area has limited the
presence of wildlife.

Geology and Pedology
Bedrock geology in the vicinity of the
project area is defined by Bureau of Economic
Geology (1974) as part of the Eagle Ford Group
(Kef). The Eagle Ford Group is composed of
Upper Cretaceous shale and limestone reaching
more than 70 feet thick, and it is characterized
as consisting an upper stratum of compact, silty
shale, an intermediate stratum of flaggy, silty
limestone grading to calcareous siltstone, and a
lower stratum of calcareous shale (Barnes 1974;
Sellards et al. 1932).

As vegetation is the ultimate nutrient source
for animals, fluctuating floral environments
cater to a wide variety of wildlife species. One
such species, Bison bison, the current and only
species of the genus Bison, has been the focus of
considerable amounts of archaeological research.
By means of paleoenvironmental reconstruction,
Mauldin et al. (2008) have suggested that the
availability of bison as a local food source for
indigenous peoples became increasingly erratic,
shadowing seasonal precipitation and mesic
conditions, in the last 1000 years. Pushing the
record of bison availability/exploitation back 8000
years (to 6000 BC), Dillehay (1974) suggested
two periods of bison presence and two periods of
bison absence. Evidence for Dillehay’s conclusion
was extrapolated from faunal assemblages at 160
archaeological and paleontological sites. This
is not to say that bison were the only wildlife

Soils in Williamson County have been
described by Werchan and Coker (1983), and
vary markedly within the project area. Soil
associations include Austin silty clay 1 to 3 percent
slopes (AuB), Austin-Whitewright complex 1 to
5 percent slopes (AwC2), Castephen silty clay
3 to 5 percent slopes (CaC), Heiden clay 3 to 5
?

Cultural Chronology

percent slopes (HeC2), Heiden clay 5 to 8 percent
slopes (HeD2), Heiden extremely stony clay 2 to
12 percent slopes (HsE), Houston Black clay 0
to 1 percent slopes (HuA), and Houston Black
clay 1 to 3 percent slopes (HuB). The complexity
of the soils and soil associations present on the
Round Rock campus are important in that they
are directly related to the possibility of buried
cultural deposits to be present. Main soil units
include Austin silty clay, Whitewright clay,
Castephen silty clay, Heiden clay, and Houston
Black clay.

The cultural chronologies for Central and
South Texas are not completely understood or
agreed upon. However, archaeological deposits
indicate rich cultural development. Black (1995),
Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004)
present the most recent syntheses of the available
chronological evidence of archaeological culture
history in the region. The following cultural
chronology is based on Black (1995), Hester
(1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004).

Austin silty clays are found on smooth,
broad upland plains. Upper layers are dark brown
dense clays that reach as deep as approximately
14 inches (35 cm), with sub-strata that extend
to approximately 36 inches (90 cm). These
underlying layers include laminated bands
of chalk, and almost certainly pre-date any
prehistoric occupation in the region. Whitewright
silty clay loams are found on gently sloping upland
surfaces. They reach as far as only 5 inches (12
cm), and have sub-strata that extend as deep as
15 inches (37.5 cm). These deposits are not very
deep, and are well-drained. Castephen silty
clays are found on gently sloping upland areas.
Surface layers are dark brown and reach as far as
16 inches (40 cm) thick. They appear to overlie
marly, chalky substrata, and consequently do not
hold much potential for deeply buried deposits.
Heiden clays are also found in upland settings.
They have upper layers reaching 30 inches (75
cm) thick, with sub-strata that extend as far as
50 inches (125 cm). Houston Black clays are
found on high ridges and in upland valleys. They
typically have dark gray upper clayey layers
that extend as much as 26 inches (65 cm) deep.
Underlying this upper layer is a sub-stratum
that is dark grayish brown with light yellowish
brown mottles extending to a possible depth of
approximately 52 inches (130 cm).

Prehistoric
The Prehistoric period is divided into
three major styles, the Paleoindian, Archaic
and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage is
characterized by the earliest human occupation
of North America prior to 8,000 BP. The Archaic
stage follows, extending from ca. 8,000 BP to
1,200 BP, and is generally seen as a time during
which humans made successful adaptations
to changing environmental conditions. The
Late Prehistoric stage begins ca. 1,200 BP and
is characterized by a resurgence of grassland
habitats and the development of bow and arrow
and ceramic technologies.

Paleoindian
Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dates the
Paleoindian period to 11,500–8,800 BP in
Central Texas, though he excludes the final
Late Paleoindian interval known as Angostura.
Diagnostic artifacts observed from this stage are
associated with the Clovis, Folsom, and a variety
of later Paleoindian cultures (Bousman et al.
2004). The Early Paleoindian stage, consisting of
Clovis and Folsom, is generally characterized by
?

nomadic cultures that relied heavily on hunting
large game animals (Black 1989). Recent research
has shown that Paleoindian peoples also utilized
a wide variety of plants and small game animals
(Black 1989; Bousman et al. 2004; Collins and
Brown 2000; Hester 1983).

with Early Basal Notched and Early Corner
Notched dart points dating between 7,950 and
4,450 BP, while Collins (1995:383, 2004) argues
that the Early Archaic spans from 8,800 to
6,000 BP based on three divisions of projectile
point types. It is generally believed that at the
beginning of the Holocene, a warming in climate
led to the extinction of large herds of megafauna
and stimulated behavioral changes of hunters and
gatherers in South-Central Texas (McKinney
1981). A dietary adjustment is evidenced by
the increased number of ground stone artifacts,
burned rock midden cooking features, and more
specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner and Hester 1993:246–
256). Early Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and
are seen across a wide area of Texas and northern
Mexico (Weir 1976).

The Late Paleoindian substage occurs from
ca.10,000–8,000 BP. Reliable evidence for these
dates was recovered from the Wilson-Leonard
site, north of Austin (Bousman et al. 2004;
Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard, archaeologists
excavated an occupation known as Wilson, named
after the unique stemmed projectile point. The
dense occupation also included a human burial
(Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1998).

Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) contends the Archaic
stage in Central Texas lasted approximately 7,500
years, from 8,800–1,200/1,300 BP, and, following
Weir (1976), divides the stage into Early, Middle,
and Late Archaic. The Archaic stage marks several
important transitions: a shift from large game
hunting to hunting smaller animals; the increased
use of plant food resources and use of ground
stones in food processing; the implementation
of stone cooking technology; increased use of
organic materials for tool manufacturing and
an increase in the number and variety of lithic
tools for wood working; the predominance of
corner- and side-notch projectile points; greater
population stability and less residential mobility;
and systematic burial of the dead. This stage is
also distinguished by environmental and climatic
changes.

Middle Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) divides the Middle
Archaic, 4,000–6,000 BP, into three projectile
point style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek,
Taylor, and Nolan and Travis. The Middle Archaic
is marked by the onset of the Altithermal, a very
warm and dry period. The Bell-Andice-Calf
Creek interval was a moist, mesic period when
grasslands expanded southwards into Central
and South Texas, followed by bison herds from
the Plains. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek peoples were
specialized bison hunters who followed the herds
southwards. As the Altithermal progressed, the
bison and bison hunters retreated northwards.
By the latter part of the Middle Archaic, Taylor
bifaces were replaced by Nolan and Travis
points (Collins 1995, 2004). The Nolan-Travis
interval was also a period when temperature and
aridity were at their greatest levels, and there is
evidence of increased utilization of xerophytes
such as sotol (Johnson and Goode 1994). During
drier episodes, the aquifer-fed streams and

Early Archaic
Collins and Hester debate the time frame of
the Early Archaic stage in Central Texas. Hester

1976:125, 128).

reveal a high proportion of arrow-wound deaths
(Black 1989; Meissner 1991; Prewitt 1974),
suggesting that population growth resulted in
disputes over limited resources.

Late Archaic

Toyah Phase

The Central Texas Late Archaic dates to
approximately 4,000–1,300/1,200 BP (Collins
1995:384, 2004). Herds of bison began returning
to the southern Great Plains, again influencing
the subsistence strategies (Dillehay 1974). Some
believe cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte
(Hall 1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988)
are evidence that populations increased and
that groups were becoming territorial (Story
1985:44–45). Others challenge the interpretation
by citing a decrease in burned rock middens
(Prewitt 1981:80–81). Pottery began appearing
in limited areas of the South Texas Plains during
this period; however, most regions remained
“pre-ceramic” for another thousand years (Story
1985:45–47).

The beginning of the Toyah phase (800 BP)
in Central Texas is discernible by the appearance
of contracting stem points with flaring, barbed
shouldered points. This phase is also characterized
by the introduction of bladelet technology that
included prismatic blades, blade cores, and
scrapers-on-blades, all considered to be part of a
specialized Toyah bison hunting and processing
toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985; Huebner 1991;
Ricklis 1994). Toyah is also characterized by the
appearance of bone-tempered pottery in Central
Texas (Johnson 1994:241–281). The wide variety
of ceramic styles and influences seen throughout
Toyah phase ceramic assemblages provide
important information on the social composition
of these groups (Arnn 2005). Toyah ceramic
assemblages display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast,
and Jornada Mogollon influences (Arnn 2005).

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late
Prehistoric in Central Texas at 1,300/1,200–260
BP, and follows Kelly (1947) in dividing it into
Austin and Toyah phases. The most significant
changes include a technological shift away from
the dart and atlatl to the bow and arrow and the
incorporation of pottery (Black 1989:32; Story
1985:45–47).

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada
Period)
In Texas, the Protohistoric period was marked
by Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions from
established forts and missions in Northern Mexico
into Central, Coastal, and East Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
These encounters began with the venture into
Texas by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
and the Narvaez expedition in 1528. The period
is generally dated between 1500 and 1700 (or
1528, the date of the Cabeza de Vaca/Narvaez
expedition, to the establishment of the first
Spanish mission, Mission San Antonio de Valero
in 1718).

Austin Phase
The Austin phase is characterized by the
appearance of small arrow points. Burned rock
middens are occasionally found with these types
of points (Houk and Lohse 1993), and ground and
pecked stone tools used for plant food processing
are increasingly common. Burials from this time

With Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El
Camino Real (the King’s Road) was established
from Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico
to East Texas. This roadway followed established
Native American trade routes and trails and
became a vital link between Mission San Juan
Bautista in Northern Mexico and the Spanish
settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw

1995). Some researchers demarcate the transition
in Texas between the Entrada (Protohistoric) and
Historic periods by the construction of the first
Spanish missions in Texas. Most knowledge of
this period is gained through the written records
of the early Spanish missionaries. Besides the
mission town of San Antonio, the only other
Spanish settlement in the region was San Marcos
de Neve, established in 1808, four miles south of
present day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was
abandoned in 1812 as a result of constant raids
by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time,
massive depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little resistance.
Those few remaining were nearly all displaced to
reservations by the mid-1850s (Fisher 1998).

Spanish priests accompanying entradas
provided the most complete information of
indigenous cultures of early Texas. Those
documented during the early entradas include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane,
who were settled around the springs at San Marcos
and described as semi-nomadic bands. Other
tribes encountered at San Marcos included mobile
hunting parties from villages in South and West
Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome,
Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading for bison
hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies (Foster
1995:265–289; Johnson and Campbell 1992;
Newcomb 1993). Later groups migrated into the
region and displaced the former groups or tribes.
These included the Tonkawa from Oklahoma and
Lipan and Comanche from the Plains (Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Dunn 1911; Newcomb 1961,
1993).

European presence in the region increased
as settlers received land grants from the Mexican
government until 1835. Settlement was difficult,
however, due to continuation of hostilities with
and raids by Native American tribes. The Texas
Rangers provided protection from these conflicts
after Texas secured independence from Mexico
in 1836.
Communities in the vicinity of the project
area, including Round Rock, Hutto, Govalle, and
Palm Valley, were settled in part by a growing
Swedish population in the mid-nineteenth century
and into the twentieth century. In 1848, a group
of 25 Swedish emigrants, from the province of
Småland and under the guidance of S. M. Swenson
and S. Palm, began to settle a small portion of
Central Texas east of the Balcones Escarpment, in
what is now eastern Travis County (Scott 1990).
The initial Swedish emigrants, and those who
closely followed, often had their passages paid
for by Swenson in return for labor. Continuing
into the early twentieth century, eastern Travis
and southern Williamson Counties’ populations

Archaeological sites dated to this period
typically contain a mix of both European
imported goods, such as metal objects and glass
beads, and traditional Native American artifacts,
such as manufactured stone tools.

be occupied by tenant farmers of Swedish origin
and descent (Peyton 2008). Sites 41WM986,
41WM1199, 41WM1200, and 41WM1201 were
not considered eligible for National Register
nomination as all were determined not to have
great research potential, and accordingly, no
further investigations were recommended.

Previous Archaeological
Investigations

Although sites in the immediate vicinity
of the project area do not exhibit much research
potential, there are three sites of significance to
Texas prehistory in southern Williamson County
along Brushy Creek’s current or abandoned
channels, 41WM13, 41WM235, and 41WM815.
These three sites have made considerable
contributions to the understanding of Central
Texas’ prehistoric inhabitants. Wilson-Leonard
(41WM235) is located not far from the project area
along Brushy Creek and contains a record of human
occupation from at least ca. 11,500 radiocarbon
years before present to the Late Archaic period
(Collins 1998). Two other important sites in the
Blackland Prairie include the Bessie Kruze Site
(41WM13), notable for its prehistoric cemetery
(Johnson 2000), and 41WM815, a good example
of prehistoric occupation on the Blackland Prairie
(Brownlow 2003). These three sites, WilsonLeonard, Bessie Kruze, and 41WM815, provide
a relevant example of the range of occupational
history of the region.

A review of the THC Texas Archeological
Site Atlas Database reveals the presence of one
prehistoric lithic scatter, 41WM673, one scatter of
prehistoric and historic artifacts, 41WM672, and
four historic homesteads/farmsteads, 41WM986,
41WM1199, 41WM1200, and 41WM1201 located
within an approximately one-kilometer radius
of the current project area. Sites 41WM672
and 41WM673 are light, surficial artifact
scatters (Vollinger et al. 1985). No temporally
diagnostic prehistoric artifacts or significant
historic materials were recovered, no features or
buried archaeological deposits were observed,
and additionally, both sites were discovered
in settings that had been disturbed by modern
agricultural practices. Accordingly, 41WM672
and 41WM673 were not considered to have greater
research potential and no further investigations
were recommended (Vollinger et al. 1985).
Sites 41WM986, 41WM1199, 41WM1200, and
41WM1201 are twentieth century homesteads/
farmsteads (McLoughlin 2001; Peyton 2008).
All of these sites consisted of one or more house
structures, barns, and wells/cisterns. However,
cultural material correlating these sites with
a particular decade or period in the twentieth
century was scant—all four were dated to at
least the first half of the twentieth century by
using aerial photographs and deed records.
In an informant interview, sites 41WM1199,
41WM1200, and 41WM1201 were reported to

Methods

The current archaeological investigation
consisted of a 100 percent systematic, intensive
pedestrian survey which included subsurface
testing within the project area boundaries. As
mandated by the minimum survey standards
10

Results

adopted by the THC for project areas of this
size, no less than one shovel test for every three
acres is required. Accordingly, approximately
33 shovel tests were required to meet minimum
survey standards. Thirty-four shovel tests were
excavated for this project. Each shovel test,
approximately 30 cm in diameter, was excavated
in 20 cm arbitrary levels to a maximum depth
of ~68 cm below surface, at which point subsoil deposits were reached. All of the excavated
sediment was passed through a ¼” hardware
screen, and if artifacts were present, they
were placed in 4 ml bags labeled with the
corresponding shovel test and level provenience
and returned to the bottom of the shovel test upon
completion of the excavation. Observations and
comments pertaining to each shovel test were
recorded by the excavator. Prior to backfilling
completed shovel tests, each was documented by
photograph, being plotting on a 7.5’ United States
Geologic Survey topographic map, and collecting
horizontal coordinates using a Trimble GeoXT
and ArcPad 7.0.1.

Upon arriving to the project area,
reconnaissance of the parcel revealed that two
small areas were impacted by 1) agricultural
terracing, and 2) ongoing campus development,
and therefore, were subject only to pedestrian
survey (Figure 3). In fact, nearly 100% (possibly
all) of the entire project area’s landscape is
currently or was recently cultivated, and to a
certain degree, shallowly disturbed; however,
the landscape is not otherwise significantly
modified, thus requiring a blanket of shovel test
excavations.
Generally, shovel tests excavated in the
eastern half of the project area, in two fields that
were recently cultivated, revealed relatively deep
(though less than ~68 cm) and dark soils with low
amounts of gravel. Between these two fields is a
heavily terraced field with a relatively increased
amount of rocks (gravel to boulder sized)
observable on the surface. It is unclear whether
these rocks are in situ or have been transported
manually or naturally from the adjacent fields.
In the eastern half of the project area, shovel
test excavations revealed bedrock or subsoil
at relatively shallower depths. In the southern
portion of the project area, in stand of woody
vegetation, an historic homestead/farmstead,
41WM1247, was recorded. Four shovel tests were
excavated in proximity to this historic site in order
to investigate subsurface cultural deposits. Two
of the four shovel tests yielded cultural material,
with most artifacts recovered from the top 20 cm.
The remaining 32 shovel tests within the project
area were devoid of artifacts.

For the historic site present within the
project area, four shovel tests were excavated to
investigate subsurface deposits, detailed notes
were written, photographs were taken, a map
was drawn by pace and compass, horizontal
coordinates of each structure or feature associated
with the site were collected using a Trimble
GeoXT and ArcPad, an informant interview was
conducted with the previous land owner, and a
chain of ownership was investigated.

barn was not conducted. However, an inspection
through the front door showed nothing more
than debris created by the barn’s current avian
inhabitants. The former house structure was
represented by burned piers, cement steps, piles
of corrugated metal, and a few items indicating
that the house was plumbed and electrified (i.e.,
bathtub, pipes, and wires). A cement lined well/
cistern was located between the barn and the
house on the west side of the sidewalk. Adjacent
to the house and barn, at the northwest corner of
the intersection between the two unnamed roads,
there is a large pile of limestone boulders that
appears to be a relatively recent addition to the site
(possibly associated with the nearby construction/
development). On the northeast corner of the
intersection, there is a corral, presumably
associated with the homestead. Located at the
intersection of the east-west oriented, unnamed
road and College Parkway (formerly CR 112),
the dump associated with the site consists of
corrugated metal, barbed wire, and various
scraps of metal that range from heavily oxidized

Cultural Features
The site is composed of a partially-collapsed
barn with a cement foundation, a completelycollapsed and burned house with pier and beam
foundation, a cement-lined well/cistern, a dump,
and a rock alignment presumed to represent
a historic fence line (Figure 5). The barn is
approximately 7-by-10 m and has a sidewalk
extending from its northern wall towards cement
steps at the front of the house, approximately 15
m north-northeast. An investigation inside the

to relatively modern in appearance. Between the
dump at the western most extent of the site, and
the house and barn, there is a pile of limestone
cobbles and boulders associated with a shallow
drainage, which possibly represents a primitive
flood control feature. Running the length of the

most 1.5 m wide.

bottle offer some insight to the era of occupation.
The automobile is located approximately 10 m
north of the house. The vehicle is covered in rust,
is missing many or most parts, and has bullet holes
in the driver’s side rear quarter panel. Just beneath
the hood is a maker’s mark, which reads, “FORDWERKE A.G. KÖLN, P 2 KO, MADE IN WEST
GERMANY.” This model vehicle, produced by a
German division of Ford, was made from 1957 to
1960 (Gruszczynski 2009). The Coca-Cola bottle
was discovered in association with the dump on
the west side of the site. The maker’s mark on
the bottle is that of Owens Illinois Glass Co.,
and dates to 1951 (Toulouse 1971). One modern
tire and three bricks were also observed on the
surface. These materials may appear to have

tests excavated in the vicinity of the house and
barn yielded artifacts including two shards of
modern green bottle glass, heavily oxidized
metal fragments, one oxidized wire nail, one
shard of clear bottle glass, and one oxidized nut
and bolt. All but the fragments of oxidized metal,
which were found approximately 30 cm below
surface, were recovered in the upper 20 cm of the
shovel tests, and all of the artifacts observed at
the site are characteristic of occupation though
the middle of the twentieth century.

that the house structure burned down three years
ago as either a result of vandalism or lightning.

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41WM1247 is typical of the area’s
twentieth-century tenant farmers, and is in a
poor state of preservation. It compares favorably
with previously recorded historic farmsteads
in the vicinity, particularly sites 41WM1199,
41WM1200, and 41WM1201, which were
occupied by Swedish immigrants to the region.
Artifacts and cultural features, as well as chain
of ownership research, do little to establish a
time of construction, however, they do indicate
occupation through the middle of the twentieth
century. As 41WM1247 does not appear to
contribute significantly to local, state, or federal
history and/or scientific methodology, CAS
recommends that no further investigations are
warranted. Should future development of the land
in the vicinity of 41WM1247 reveal an unmarked
cemetery or human interments, however, work
should cease and the THC should be notified
immediately in order to determine the amount
and intensity of further investigations.

Informant Interview and Chain of
Ownership
An investigation of the property’s chain
of ownership, by way of Williamson County
Clerk’s deed records, showed nothing more than
the recent exchange between the Avery Ranch
Company, Ltd. and the Texas State University
system. The deed records extend from the present
to 1951 with intermittent entries going back
into the late-nineteenth century. The absence
of this particular parcel in the records of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries was clarified
in an interview with John S. Avery, in which he
disclosed the historic ownership of the land by the
Avery family. The land surrounding and including
the project area was originally acquired by the
family in the 1860s. By the 1870s, emigrants of
Jönköping, Småland, Sweden were occupying
tracts of the Avery property as tenant farmers.
Sites 41WM1199, 41WM1200, and 41WM1201,
as well as this site, 41WM1247, are examples of
such tenant farmsteads. John S. Avery was able
to recall a number of details about 41WM1247
including that the family who last occupied the
farmstead were the Noreens of Jönköping, the
stand of woody vegetation encapsulating the
farmstead was once a field used for cultivating
cotton, many of the rock piles were a result of
preparing the soil for agricultural endeavors, and

Conclusions

This report provides results of a systematic
survey performed on behalf of Round Rock
Higher Education Center (RRHEC) and prior
to the eventual development of campus. In
compliance with Antiquities Code of Texas,
the intensive archaeological survey of the
approximately 101-acre RRHEC property, which
required 34 shovel tests in addition to pedestrian
survey, resulted in the discovery of an historic
15

tenant farmstead, 41WM1247. This site appears
ineligible for National Register of Historic
Places, State Archaeological Landmark, and/or
Recorded Texas Historic Landmark status on
grounds that it is in a poorly preserved state. The
site, by itself, does not contribute significantly
to local, state, or national histories; it does not
exhibit noteworthy architectural design; and
appears not to be able to contribute to scientific
techniques, theory, or methods of preservation.
Accordingly, CAS recommends that no further
investigations are warranted, and that RRHEC
should be granted permission to proceed with
plans should they involve development of the
land on which 41WM1247 is located.
