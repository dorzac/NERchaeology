FROM THE DIRECTOR
OPEN HOUSE

The !lopen house" for TARL's
new Collections Facility and the
lunch for the Friends program,
held on April 30, was a great suc­
cess. Over 169 registered during
these events and we suspect about
30 more were also present. The
TARL staff worked very hard to
get things ready for both the open
house and the lunch, and I am very
appreciative to all involved, We
plan to have another program for
the Friends in April or May 1996
and will get the details to you as
soon as possible.
ADM'INISTRATIVE CHANGES

Effective September 1, Dr.
Michael B. Collins is the new As­
sociate Director of TARL. Mike
replaces Dr, Solveig Turpin, now
a Research Fellow in the UT Insti­
tute of Latin American Studies.
Many of you know Mike from his
years of archeological work in
Texas (and the publications that
have resulted; see below for the
latest) and his involvement with

the Texas Archeological Society.
In the last couple of years, he has
ramroded the TAS Budget Com­
mittee, and he has been nominated
for TAS President-elect in 1997.
Mike's main responsibilities are in
heading our contract program
through TARL's Sponsored Pro­
jects unit. I also look forward to
working with him on the further
development of T ARL and the
Friends program,
NEW TARL PUBLICATIONS

Two major new TARL publi­
cations have just appeared, Both
are 2-volume works that provide a
great deal of new information on
Texas archeology. Both are in
TARL's Studies in Archeology se­
ries. Robert Ricklis (T ARL Re­
search Fellow) and Michael B.
Collins (T ARL Associate Direc­
tor) are the authors ofArchaic and
Late Prehistoric Human Ecology
in the Middle Onion Creek Valley,
Hays County, Texas (Studies No.
19) a 2-volume, 651-page report
(with 275 figures and 161 tables,
and covers designed by Ken

I
Brown of TARL) that details the
excavations of several sites near
Buda in 1989-1990 under contract
with the Texas Department of
Transportation. Volume I provides
details on the components found at
the Barton site (Early Archaic:
BelliAndice/Calf Creek), the Mus­
tang Branch (Bluff) site (a Late
Archaic burned rock midden, and
the Mustang Branch (Terrace) site
(a Toyah campsite). In a depar­
ture from traditional chronological
terms, they suggest the use of the
term "interval" to label cultural
episodes. Most important is their
look at long-term adaptive change
in this area. In Volume 2, there are
numerous topical studies. They in­
clude the study of a historic site,
geomorphic studies in the middle
Onion Creek valley, vegetational
analyses, paleobotanical research,
faunal analysis, molluscan studies,
reports on radiocarbon dates (and
thermoluminescence and arch eo­
magnetic research), archeomag­
netism, the use of a magnetometer

SUMMER FIELD SCHOOL

In June and July, Dr. Mike
Collins and I co-directed the UT
summer field school, held in Vic­
toria County, south Texas. As de­
tailed elsewhere in the
Newsletter (articles by
Stark, pg. 26 and Hester
and Walter pg. 8),
~~~
geoarcheological stud- _'O<~Lies were carried out at ----'-..,
site 41VT1l2 in the
Riverside Park in Victo- &;;~""',
ria (part ofthe work was
supported by a contract
with the Parks and
Recreation Department ofthe City
of Victoria). Several members of
the Friends dropped by the exca­
vations, one was a student (Betty
Inman), and others helped in many
ways. For example, Bill Birming­
ham arranged for the DuPont Cor­
poration to erect scaffolding and
shade over the main excavations.
Mike and I are also grateful to Ed
Vogt, Jr., discoverer of the site,
who worked daily in the excava­
tions, and to Smitty Schmiedlin for
logistical work unparalleled.
Smitty and Bill also hosted a bar­
beque for the field school on July
4. Phil Manning, a new member of
the Friends, video-recorded many
hours of the excavations, and this
documentation is now curated at
TARL.
The field school also did work at
41VTll, north of Victoria, the second
location of Mission Espiritu Santo de

The field school received a
great deal of support from the citi­
zens of Victoria, local avocational
archeologists, our campground
owner, Mr. Charlie Faupel, the
project cooks/camp managers,
Curt and Helen Harrell, and Patsy
Goebel, and Parks and
Recreation staff mem­

ACADEMIC

YEAR
Thanks to the UT Austin Uni­
versity Research Institute and a
grant from the National Endow­
ment for the Humanities, I am on
academic leave for the 1995-1996
school year. The purpose of the
leave is to provide time for me to
work with Harry Shafer of Texas
A&M (also on leave this year) on
a book that provides a synthesis of
our work at Colha, Belize since
1979. This is to be published by
The University of Texas Press. In
Fall 1995, I am also on administra­
tive leave, and Dr. Mike Collins is
serving as Acting Director of
TARL. So, if I am hard to find, my
apologies! Leave messages with
T ARL's administrative associate,
Gabriel Guardiola, at 512-471­

FRIENDS ADD To COAHUILA
ARCHIVES
The director ofthe archives for
the Centro de Estudios Sociales y
Humanisticas in Saltillo, Coahuila,
Martha Rodriguez Garcia recently
requested, via historian Jack Jack­
son, copies of published and un­
published reports on the archeol­
ogy of the Spanish missions at
Guerrero, Coahuila. Restoration
of the unfinished church at San
Bernardo is ongoing, and Martha
wants to be sure that they are done
correctly! From what was seen by
Dr. Hester and others at San
Bernardo in October 1993, some of
the restorations are not as accurate
as they might be, and there is con­
cern that the church, which was
never completed and never roofed,
might now be roofed according to
local preconceptions. Through
photocopying support from the
Friends program, a complete set of
excavation and analysis documents
from the 1975-1977 UTSA investi­
gations at San Bernardo and San
Juan Bautista, along with architec­
tural and other data from the area,
are now in these important Saltillo
archives.~

PROJECTS

ExCAVATIONS AT MISSION EsP(RlTU SANTO

(41VTl I), JUNE-JULY 1995

by Thomas R. Hester and Tamara Walter
During the course ofthe 1995 UT­
Austin summer archeological field
schooL investigations were canied out at
site 41VTll, on the GuadalupeRiver in
Victoria County. There are standing
stone ruins at this locality, long thought
to be the second location of Mission
Espiritu Santo de Zuniga, from 1726­
1749 (see the paper by Kay Hindes in
this issue of the Newsletter that deals
with whether this is the second or the
third location of this mission). In 1749,
the mission was moved, a final time, to
Goliad; a much Jarger mission complex:
was established there (Mounger 1959)
and is now a state park The first
location of this mission, apparently on
Garcitas Creek in Jackson County, has
been the subject of intensive search in
recent years by the Office ofthe State
Archeologist, assisted by E. H
Schmiedlin and Kay Hindes.
Staff from the State Archeologists
office, along with Anne Fox, E. H
Schmied1in, and others had canied out
brief studies at 41VTll in 001994 and
spring 1995. TARL provided Total
Data Station mapping ofthe site as part
ofthis research. These recent fieldwotk
episodes had exposed portions of the
ruins, but had yielded little in the way of
material culture. Due to landowner
enthusiasm, the State Archeologistls
office encouraged further, more
intensive feseNCh at the site. Thus, plans
were made fur Tamara Walter (MA
student at the University ofMontana) to
wolk at the site in coI]unction with the
UT summer field school.

was p1anned, as was limited excavation
ofselected portions ofthe ruins.
Under our supervision, fieldwork
was conducted from June 22 to JUly 11.
In this, we were aided by a nwnber of
students from the UT Field School
(including one day, rained out at
41VT112 [River Spur site], in which
everyone participated!). Invaluable
assistance was provided by E. H
Schmiedlin, who shared his considerable
knowledge of the site and the
surrounding ranch. John and Judy
Clegg, owners of the ranch, were very
hospitable, and we were further aided by
C. A Calhoun (Victoria) and Jnnmy
Bluhm (Goliad State Park). Anne A
Fox (UTSA) visited the site for two
days and shared her expertise in the
identification of Spanish colonial
artifacts. Patsy Goebel did yeoman's
duty by worlcing each day at the mission
in addition to her vohmteer duties as one
ofour cooks at the project headquarters!
The fieldwork was initiated by a
series oftest pits dug in an anaqua grove
west of the mission ruins. A zone of
mission Indian materials was found in
this area, yielding faunal remains, mussel
shell, marine shell fragments, bone­
tempered pottery (including loop
handles), f1akes, end scrapers, and
Guerrero arrow points. Some Spanish
ceramics were also recovered, dated by
Fox to the early 18th century. Other
Spanish artifucts were few, consisting
mainly of bits of copper and two glass
beads (Cecil Calhoun valiantly water­
screened large amounts of screened
matrix to check for glass beads and
recovered an additional tiny specimen).
The mission Indian occupation
is thus both well preserved and
extensive in this area (and
apparently has Scallorn and Darl
occupations underlying it) and

may have well been the locale of
their habitation areas during the 26
years the mission was in operation.
This possibility is bolstered by the
fact that test pits east of the ruin
yielded sparse mission Indian
remains. In addition, the soils in
that area are very thin and
preservation of cultural remains is
poor.
Two l-x-l-m units were placed in an
area just northwest ofthe mission ruins
in an area we called the "bone bed."
Recent deming had revealed a deposit
offiwnal remains and associated mission
Indian artifacts, lying just below the
surface and resting on the caliche
bedrock. Careful exposure of this
deposit yielded abundant broken bones,
mostly ofbison or cow-sized mammals,
though bones (not yet identified) of
smaller animals were also found.
Numerous mussel shel1s and some fish
bone were recovered. A nwnber of
bone-tempered sherds were mixed
among the bones, as were several end
scrapers (two with bits snapped oft) and
at least two Guerrero point fragments
(see Turner and Hester 1993; identical
points are reported from the Goliad
location of Espiritu Santo by Mounger
[1959:P1.67,D-K] and from Mission
Rosario by Gihnore [1974:Fig. 34,c,d.])
A small rectangular mussel shell bead
with two perforations was also
recovered
While these excavations were
underway, Jack D. Eaton carried out
selective excavations of exposed
architecture. This provided more
infonnation on the dimensions of what
are at least two rooms in the main
structure (the function ofwhich remains
unknown). A mound just south ofthe
main ruin was also tested and found to
be a room with stone walls, with the
interiors of the walls plastered and

painted red. C. A Calhoun (report on
file at TARL) had recorded, in 1965, a
post-mission burial placed in the
northeast corner of this room Eaton's
excavations succeeded in better defining
two architectural components at the
mission. The northern part of the
mission has been badly damaged during
the 20th century by treasure hunters and
looters; it would ~uire extensive
clearing to see if any architectural
elements are intact. Eaton suggests that
the chapel ofthe mission may have been
located in that area.
Additional important work was
done by Kenneth M Brown in mapping
the site. He was able to field-check and
add to the IDS map produced by UT
students Jason Lucas and Matt Williams
in October 1994. We thus have an
excellent contour map of the mission
and its environs.
In closing, we can note that there
remains no doubt that 41Vf 11 was a
location (presumably the second) of
Mission Espiritu Santo. In addition, the
sizable sample of mission Indian
materials from the 1995 research will
provide significant clues on subsistence
and other Indian activities at the mission
Walters thesis will fucus on the mission
Indian data and will provide an
important perspective on their material
culture and lifeways in the period
between 1723-1749.

HISTORIC ARCHEOLOGY
PRIMARY DOCUMENTATION EVIDENCE FOR THREE LOCATIONS OF MISSION EspiRITU SANTO DE
ZUNIGA: CLARIFYING THE HISTORICAL RECORD

by V. Kay Hindes
This paper presents evidence
that site 41 VTll, currently recog­
nized as the second site ofMission
Espiritu Santo de Zuniga, is more
likely the third site of the mission.
Primary source research in eigh­
teenth century Spanish colonial
documents coupled with sec­
ondary source research, supports
this belief. The documentary data
regarding an additional location
for the mission was uncovered
during historical and archival re­
search conducted in 1994-1995
(Hindes, working papers submit­
ted to the Office of the State
Archeologist, Austin) prior to field
surveys conducted under the aus­
pices of the Office of the State
Archeologist (OSA), Texas His­
torical Commission (THC). The
objective of the OSA survey was
to locate the first site of the mis­
sion. Since the 1970s, the OSA
has been involved in a series of in­
vestigations aimed at locating the
first site of the Mission Espiritu
Santo de Zuniga (1722-1725/26).
Although the later locations of the
mission (as well as the Presidio
Nuestra Senora de Loreto) were
not of primary interest during the
current studies, a review of all as­
pects of mission development and
history was necessary to under­
stand the mission's founding.
Site 41 VT 11 is currently rec­
ognized as the second location of
the mission (see Hester and Walter

is this issue). It is situated in the
Mission Valley, near the commu­
nity of Nursery along the
Guadalupe River about six miles
northwest of Victoria. Prior to the
mISSIon being located here,
archival records point to an interim
location (the area of Victoria
proper?) occupied for a very short
period oftime. The eminent histo­
rian Reverend Fray Marion Habig,
along with James Sutton, a former
archivist and librarian at Our Lady
of the Lake University, San Anto­
nio and avocational historian John
Jarrett, have all previously recog­
nized this interim location.
The history oflocational moves for
both the Mission Espiritu Santo de
Zuiiiga and the corresponding Presidio
Nuestra Seiiora de Loreto is not easily
derived from the primary source docu­
ments. Ongoing research should help in
the complicated task of understanding
the sequence ofmoves as well as other
events related to the missions and pre­
sidio. Areport detailing the results ofthe
fieldwork conducted in 1989 and 1994
by the OSA to locate the first site ofmis­
sion, is in progress (Hindes and Ma1louf
nd.). It includes historical research into
aspects ofthe mission and the mission's
relationship with the Presidio Nuestra
Smora de Loreto and LaSalle's Fort St.
Louis.
Abandonment of the first mis­
sion and presidio locations on
Garcitas Creek was considered as
early as April 15, 1725 (Bustillo to

the Viceroy 1726:60). On April 1,
1726, Bustillo selected and sur­
veyed a site on the Guadalupe
River for the presidio. After a de­
lay of almost a year from the time
first considered for the move, Al­
mazan finally approved the site
surveyed earlier by Bustillo
(Bustillo to the Viceroy 1726:60).
We do not yet know exactly when
the mission was moved from
Garcitas Creek; however, it was at
its new location by April 1, 1726
(Bustillo to the Viceroy:60-61).
Two of the three priests assigned
to the mission-Fray Ignacio
Baena (or Bahena) and Fray Diego
Zapata-had died by 1725
(Leutenegger
and
Habig
1973: 111). Only Fray Agustin Pa­
tron remained at the mission, and
we can surmise that Patron, af­
flicted with a "horrible disease of
running sores" (Ramsdell 1963:5)
was eager to find a more suitable
location. He also wanted to find
more receptive neophytes. The
presidio was not moved until after
August 29, 1726 (Bustillo to the
Viceroy 1726:63).
Regarding the proposed move
of the presidio, Juan Antonio
Bustillo y Zevallos, Captain of the
Presidio wrote on June 18, 1726
(emphasis mine):
.. .I pointed out to him the
banks of the Guadalupe
River.. being about five

leagues more or less, distant from here, a site
(the one I had previously surveyed for this
purpose) on the same river which he thought
to be very appropriate for the location of The
Presidio ... for although in the one referred to
on the 2nd of September concerning which
Your Excellency has been made aware, of the
location of the Ranch, at which time I had not
seen this one which is more extensive ... with
the referred to advantages and that of a creek
a fourth of a league distant where I have
drawn out water for the Mission and the Mis­
sionary Father has established himself there...
and trying to attract the Jaraname Indi­
ans ... being a very large nation so that in order
to reach all it will be necessary to establish an­
other Mission, by a copious creek which I
have surveyed on the new road I opened to the
Rio Grande, a distance of about threes leagues
from the site designated from the Presidio
[Bustillo to the Viceroy 1726: 60-61, in Jarrett
1967].
Fernando Perez de Almazan, the Governor of
Texas who accompanied Bustillo to inspect the site
chosen by Bustillo wrote on, July 4, 1726:
Pursuant to the request Your Excellency made
to Don Juan Bustillo, Captain of the Presidio
de la Bahia del Espiritu Santo in your letter on
the 15th of April oflast year 117251 asking him
to communicate with me if he thought it expe­
dient to move that Presidio from the bad loca­
tion where it is at present; ... and I went to it
and after examining that vicinity with great
care a place was found in the Northwest, six
leagues distant on the banks of the Guadalupe
river.. .. To this must be added, that within a
distance of less than a league of the aforemen­
tioned place there is a creek of sweet water,
and they assure me that it is permanent where
it will be easy to get a surco and a half of wa­
ter for irrigation of the lands and to assemble
some Indians in a mission ... whose Acequia is
already runing Isicl ... and after I have been

advised that another Creek has been located
on this side ofthe river... at a distance of three
leagues. .. having an abundance of water and
with sufficient land for an ample Mission
[Almazan to the Viceroy 1726:57-58, in Jar­
rett 1967].
Bustillo reported the distance of the location cho­
sen for the new presidio to be about five leagues
"poco mas 0 menos" from the old presidio (Bustillo
to the Viceroy 1726:60). Almazan stated that the dis­
tance was six leagues (Almazan to the Viceroy
1726:57). The mission location (in relation to the site
selected for the presidio), where the Mission Fathers
had established themselves and begun an acequia is
noted in both documents: Bustillo reports 1/4 league
(Bustillo to the Viceroy 1726:61) while Almazan
recorded it as "less than a league" (Almazan
1726:57). By extrapolation, the second mission loca­
tion was 5 114 leagues (13.80 miles) to less than 7
leagues (18 .41 miles) from the first presidio on the
Garcitas. Sutton believed the creek located 1/4 of a
league to possibly be Spring Creek (Sutton 1968:
n.p.). In 1968, Sutton noted evidence of a possible
earthen dam a few yards north of the Athletic Field in
Riverside Park. This has not been confirmed.
Father Habig believed the second location of the mission
to be near Bloomington, but "it could not poSSlbly have been
the Mission Valley site" (Habig to Williams 1969). Jarrett
(1967:10) believed that the distances mentioned in translations
indicated that the priests had settled at the Tonkawa
(Toncahua) Bank. In his identification of eight Spanish colo­
nial sites for the Victoria County Historical Society (1968). Jar­
rett's (1968) Site NO.3 is identified as the "second site ofMis­
sion Senora de Espiritu Santo de Zuniga" This site is the
Tonkawa Bluff (41VTlO) site currently identified by an Offi­
cial Texas Historical Marker as the visifLl ofthe mission Jarrett
(1968) also identified the Mission Valley site as the "third loca­
tion"
Most importantly, Almazan and Bustillo stated that the lo­
cation selected for a larger mission (than the one already pre­
sent on the Guadalupe) was at a copious creek 3 leagues dis­
tant from the site chosen for the Presidio. By taking the extrap­
olated distances for the mission in relation to the site selected

A

STATUS RBoRT

by Harry Iceland, Thomas R. Hester, Harry J. Shafer, and Dale Hudler
The Colha Preceramic Pro­
ject, directed by Hester along
with Shafer of Texas A&M Uni­
versity, has been investigating the
Preceramic occupations of north­
ern Belize since 1993, building on
earlier test excavations and ex­
tensive regional surveys by col­
leagues of The Colha Project go­
ing back several years. An
overview of Preceramic research
in northern Belize and the results
of the 1993 field season were
published in the September 1993
issue of the Newsletter. This re­
port will discuss work completed
since that time, including (1) the
results of on-going laboratory
analyses of materials recovered
during the 1993 field season, (2)
a summary of our 1994 excava-

tions at Colha, and (3) a first look
at our 1995 fieldwork at the
Kelly site, a Preceramic quarry
near Ladyville, Belize. This pro­
ject has been funded by a Na­
tional Science Foundation grant
(SBR-9406902)
to
Hester
through TARL and by an Ad­
vanced Research Program grant
from the Texas Higher Education
Coordinating Board (project
number 003658-173). This sup­
port and the cooperation of the
Department of Archaeology of
the Government of Belize is
greatly appreciated. Permission
to work at Colha was granted by
Mr. Andrew Wang and at the
Kelly site by Mr. R. Gillett of
BurrelL Cordial thanks to John
Masson for helping gain access to
the Kelly site.

Fieldwork at Colha in
1993 had focused on a 4-x-6 m
block excavation at Operation
4046, on the edge of an
aguada, or natural depression,
about 300 m from Cobweb
Swamp. These excavations
firmly established the presence
of at least two Preceramic
components at Colha. We now
have seven calibrated radio­
carbon dates for the latter
component, known as Zone C,
between 800-1500 B.C., with
most in the 1000-1300 B.C.

range. The earlier component,
Zone D, is tentatively dated to
about 2000-3000 B.C., based on
two radiocarbon assays using soil
humates. These latter dates,
while very approximate, are con­
sistent with contemporaneous ra­
diocarbon dates associated with
early forest clearance and incipi­
ent cultivation provided by eco­
logical and palynological studies
carried out by John G. Jones and
John S. Jacob of Texas A&M in
the adjacent swamp.
Recent laboratory analysis by
Iceland (also project field direc­
tor) has focused on the lithic ma­
terial from Zone D. While analy­
sis of the Zone D lithics is not yet
complete, a combination of ap­
proaches, including technologi­
cal, micro wear, and refitting
studies, has enabled us to identify
a number of lithic production ac­
tivities taking place at or near the
edge of the Operation 4046
aguada during the third millen­
nium B.C. The aguada appears to
have been a locus of chert quar­
rying and production activity
throughout the Late Preceramic.
Chert nodules, some of boulder
size, were extracted from the
aguada and tested for knapping
suitability, while core preparation
and further reduction activities
took place on the margins of the
aguada. It seems likely that sea­

sult of extensive later Maya con­
struction.

Refitted small blades from Zone D,
Colha 1993.

Large nodules were used to make
macroblade and macroflake cores, and
smaller nodules were also used to pro­
duce a variety ofblade and flake cores.
We recovered several huge blade cores
along with massive macroblades, or
"megablades," but these appear too
large for use as tool blanks and may be
by-products or ~ects discarded during
macroblade production or, as George
Odell (personal communication) has
suggested, used as expedient quanying
tools. Only a few well-formed rnacrob­
lades with parallel edges and ridges were
recovered at the site, but the presence of
several aborted proximal rnacroblade
fragments, broken blade segments, and
cores with long blade scars point to their

production in significant numbers.
These macroblades would have been
suitable blanks for the five complete uni­
fuces and a single bifuce which seem to
represent the target: forms in the Zone D
reduction sequence. Microwear analysis
carried out by project field lab director
Hudler (see also the May 1994 issue of
the Newsletter) indicates that one of
these, a finely flaked pointed uniface,
was probably utilized, based on micro­
scopic identification of edge rounding
and polish, butthe others likely were not,
indicating they are probably unfinished
tools discarded in the final stage ofpro­
duction. Several small prepared cores
were also recovered, along with numer­
ous small whole and broken blades.
Successful efforts to identify
refitting pieces among the Zone D
material have provided further evi­
dence of on-site production activi­
ties and means for evaluating site
integrity. Refits have been identi­
fied that further confirm in situ
production of macroblades, spe­
cific core-preparation activities,
and production of small blades
from prepared cores. Undergrad­
uate David Martinez (work-ing
under an Advanced Research Pro­
gram grant to Hester) has been
working steadily and systemati­
cally on these refits, which will
clearly make an important contri­
bution to our analytical studies. At
the suggestion of Jessica Johnson
of the Texas Memorial Museum
Conservation Laboratory, we are
using a recently developed acrylic
adhesive which has a long "open
time," possibly up to one year, that
permits us to repeatedly stick refit­
ting artifacts together and pull

in situ, in Zone C, several exam­
ples of the distinctive constricted
unifaces that have been found at
several Precerarnic sites in north­
ern Belize. An important objective
of the 1994 excavations at Colha
was to place the Preceramic finds
of previous years, especially the
Zone C component containing the
constricted unifaces, in a broader
occupational context. We wanted
to know specifically where these
Preceramic people lived, what
kind of dwellings they occupied,
and what other subsistence, ritual ,
or craft-making activities they
practiced.
Two specific areas of Colha
appeared to be promising locations
for additional Preceramic occupa­
tions, the main plaza, where exca­
v~~ns~1989hadrecovcred~-

merous constricted unifaces in
Middle Preclassic Maya construc­
tion fill, and the swamp forest,
where ecological research had
provided evidence of agricultural
activities in Precerarnic times and
anaerobic conditions in water­
logged soils might preserve or­
ganic remains of early occupa­
tions. Test excavations carried out
by archeologists Jack Eaton and
Dana Anthony in three areas in and
around the ceremonial center pro­
duced important data concerning
Middle and Late Preclassic con­
struction and caching activities,
and graduate students Keith Prilli­
man and Michael McGuirt strug­
gled valiantly in the swamp forest,
where finds included rare hot spots
of preserved organic material, but

we found no evidence of Prece­
ramic occupations in these areas.
A series of test excavations were
placed around the edge ofthe aguada at
Operation 4046, the site ofour block ex­
cavation the previous year, to try to de­
termine the extent and character ofthe
Preceramic activities in this part of the
site. Two adjoining units covering 12
m2, Suboperations 20 and 21, super­
vised by Prilliman and Anthony, proved
rich in Preceramic data that reinforce the
results of our analyses ofthe 1993 data
and supplement them in important ways.
Most promising, at this point, are the dis­
covery ofwhat appears to be a Middle
Preclassic platform on the edge of the
aguada containing large numbers of di-

agnostic macroblade burin spall cores.
This platform was built directly over an
area ofPreceramic stone-working activi­
ties, including an apparent constricted
uniface production locale. This new data
should enable us to define better local
Precerarnic lithic reduction strategies and
techniques for comparative purposes as
well as the temporal relationship be­
tween the Preceramic and earliest Maya
occupations ofthe site.

trations at the westem end of the east­

were linked in a 4-m block that was ex­
cavated as twelve 1_m2 units, Subopera­
tions 5-16. The first lithic concentration
(Suboperation 5) was surface collected
and then excavated to the bottom of
layer 1, a surfuce layer of fine brown
sand just 5 em deep. At the bottom of
this layer, in athick lens offlake debitage,
three unifuce fragments were found, two

matching unifuce proxin1al end and an­
other unifuce preform with at least two
refitting flakes in layer 2, along with a
coarse sandstone bowl fragment, all in a
mass of chert cobbles and flakes. Sand­
stone bowls were found by the Colha

with Preceramic projectile points. No

Belize chert-bearing wne, apparently in
part contemporaneous with Operation
4046 at Colha. This site, located on wet
savannah near the Belize River, was
originally identified by the late Tom
Kelly during the Colha Regional Survey.
We visited the site in 1994 and found
lithic concentrations, including large
numbers of chert flakes and broken and
nearly complete constricted unifuces,
that appeared to be the remains ofPrece­
ramic activity areas recently exposed by
heavy sand quarrying equipment. We
returned in late March of this year to
record and collect the most promising of
these disturbed concentrations and to
seek undisturbed lithic activity areas in
the sandy, grassy areas ofthe site as yet
untouched by modem quarrying activity.
We began by mapping and collect­
ing SUboperation 1, a mass of exposed
lithic debris in the southwestern comer
ofthe modem quarry area. In addition to
flake debitage, this proved to contain
four constricted unifuce fragments, ap­
parently abandoned in manufacture.

icant conclusions seem evident at
this early stage. It seems clear that
fairly intensive stone quarrying and
production activities were taking
place at various locations in the
northern Belize chert-bearing zone
going back, possibly continuously,
to at least 3000 B.C. Even at this
early date, stoneworking shows
evidence of standardization and
skill, rather than the nodule bash­
ing or other kinds of expedient
flake production that have charac­
terized early chipped stone indus­
tries elsewhere in Mesoamerica

(e.g., Stark 1981:357-358). These
lithic activities, moreover, coin­
cided with the initial appearance of
cultigens and possible gradual in­
tensification of agriculture in some
parts the region. At Colha, where
they occur together, the combina­
tion of cultivation and chert ex­
ploitation provide some evidence
of population size, concentration,
and permanence of residence be­
yond that of hunter-foragers. It
may be that together, the year­
round potential for cultivating and
gathering resources on the swamp
margin and exploiting the lithic

raw material of the nearby uplands
provided the initial incentives for
sedentism, territoriality, social dif­
ferentiation, and eventual adoption
of Mesoamerican cultural tradi­
tions in this corner of the eastern
Maya lowlands.

ARMY CORPS AND SMITHSONIAN PERSONNEL VISIT TARL

In August, TARL was visited by a group of eight researchers from
the Smithsonian Institution of Natural History Museum, The Utah
Museum of Natural History, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St.
Louis District. The purpose of the visit was to test and evaluate a
database package called the Chicago Standard NAGPRA collection
assessment software.
We received a letter from Michael K. Trimble, Director, Mandatory
Center ofExpertise for the Curation and Management of Archaeological
Collections which said:
"Thank you for allowing personnel from the St. Louis District and the
Smithsonian Institution to use collections at your institution to beta test the
Chicago Standards Native AmeriG3n Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
(NAGPRA) collection assessment software. Your staff's assistance and
cooperation~ particularly Darrell Cree& Laura Nightengale, and Carolyn Spoc~
were invaluable to our completion ofthis project. "

1995, Dr. Hester gave a lecture on
the 1936-1937 WPA excavations
at the Fall Creek sites in Llano and
San Saba counties. This research
was published by A. T. Jackson in
1938 (The University of Texas
Publications No. 3802) and the
collections are curated at TARL.
These collections were upgraded
several years ago via a National
Science Foundation grant to
TARL.
The lecture was hosted by

dues, no staff, and no project fund­
ing-just a group of interested
professional and avocational
archeologists with ideas, infotma­
tion, and enthusiasm. We need
help from knowledgeable residents
of the area, avocational archeolo­
gists, landowners, plant and animal
experts, flintknappers, and anyone
else who might be intrigued.
The idea is simple. By agree­
ing to cooperate and work toward
common research objectives (to be
established) whenever possible, an
infotmal research group might be
able to make considerable
progress over the next 5 to 10
years in shedding research light on
an intriguing archeological region.
Such an approach might help over­
come the difficulties that individu­
als and individual research projects
face when trying to make sense of
small pieces of the archeological
puzzle. As a group, we might also
be able to help insure that impor­
tant archeological sites are pre­
served and protected for future
generations. Here are a few exam­
ples of the kinds of cooperation
that we envision.
Let's start with our observa­
tions that a distinctive polish ap­
pears to be present on a number of
different kinds of chipped stone
tools from the southern Edwards
Plateau. The accompanying pho­
tographs show magnified exam­
ples of well-developed polish and
striations on two artifacts, a butted
biface from Kerr County and a thin
triangular knife from Glenn
Goode's excavation of the Heard

Schoolhouse site (41 UV86) in the
Dry Frio Canyon in northern
Uvalde County. Dale Hudler, a
graduate student at UT Austin and
budding use-wear expert, infers
that the polish was most likely pro­
duced by contact with plant mate­
rial containing or coated with
gritty soil (which caused the stria­
tions). The striations are helpful
because they show the direction of
the use motion. While we hypoth­
esize that these tools represent
sotol-trimming knives, we need to
examine a much larger sample of
tools and to replicate the wear pat­
terns experimentally.
On a clean art:ifuct, wel1-developed
polish is easily visible to the unaided eye
as very lustrous, glossy patches. Goode
has found several other examples among
the 41UV86 artifact assemblage. In a
cooperative prqject, those who have ac­
cess to other site collections from the
area could search these for additional ex­
amples. The microscopic use wears of
select examples could be documented
and photographed at TARL (with our
digital imaging system). Interested
flintknappers could contribute by mak­
ing sets ofreplicate tools. Those with an
experimental bent could help use the
replicate tools for specific tasks (such as
sotol trinuning) so we can build up a
comparative conection of tools with
documented uses. In tum, the experi­
mental wear patterns couldthen be com­
pared to archeological examples.
Another promising coopera­
tive project would be to pull to­
gether what is known ofthe arche­
ology and environment of specific
areas of the southern Plateau to
help create the bigger picture. We

need to expand upon existing re­
search, such as geologist Gene
Mear's pioneering geomorphologi­
cal study of the Sabinal Canyon,
archeologist Lee Bement's disser­
tation study of the Bering Sinkhole
cemetery (now a UT Press book),
and the plant studies of botanist
Oscar Van Auken (and his stu­
dents) at the University ofTexas at
San Antonio (UTSA).
The
landowners and long-time resi­
dents of the southern Edwards
Plateau know the environment and
archeology of their stomping
grounds far more intimately than
any researcher based in Austin (or
San Antonio) ever will. However,
without a framework and direc­
tion, those with the knowledge
might not have the opportunity or
occasion to share it and work with
scientists, for instance, to create
published accounts for posterity.
Also,
geologists,
biologists,
hunters, and others interested in
natural history could be tapped as
resources. Perhaps we could or­
ganize a series of infotmal field
visits (like geological groups often
do) to various areas of the region.
Such visits would be good occa­
sions to share ideas and observa­
tions and perhaps bring about a
greater research interest in the
area.
What we need now is a show of
hands from Friends ofTARL, mends of
Friends, members ofarcheological soci­
eties, students, cultural resource man­
agers, and other interested parties. If
you are interested in participating in such
an infOnnal research group, pleasetake a

TECHNIQUES
CAsTING ARTIFACTS

by Dustin Wright
Why do archeologists cast arti­
facts? Many times we encounter
ownership problems in regards to
artifacts. Some landowners want
to keep them, collectors may be
unwilling to part with them, some
governments may not want them
to leave the country, collections
may have to be turned over to
clients or Native American groups,
etc. With casting technology, we
can at least keep replicas of the
fish that would have otherwise got
away. Casting is relatively easy
and can be reasonably cheap.
Once you have decided to cast
a lithic or any other suitable object
you will have to gather your sup­
plies. Some of the materials
needed are not readily available for
purchase. This is especially true in
the case of resin casts involving
Geltate molds. Cheaper materials
are available but these tend to be
toxic. This poses an unnecessary
risk to the caster as well as the en­
vironment. Budget yourself some
extra money and stick to friendlier
materials. Algenate, Geltate, and
casting resins can be ordered from
a plastics or rubber supply com­
pany. A quick trip through the yel­
low pages should yield results. Un­
fortunately these products tend to
be a little expensive and small
quantities are not always available.
If you are using the Alganate
method most of your supplies are
readily available in Austin at Ar­
madillo Clay. For less than $30,

you can obtain 25 pounds of mod­
eling clay and dental grade plaster
as well as a couple of clay tools.
The Alganate itself can be ordered
from Teledyne Gel (Teledyne Gel,
Elk Grove IL., 60007-5548). Al­
ganate costs about $6.00 per
pound, a pound going quite far.
The only other materials needed
are a spray bottle, water, some
cardboard strips, paper towels,
mixing containers, stirring sticks, a
little Vaseline, a small square
board, large rubber bands or strips
of inner tube, possibly some
burlap, and a tape deck or radio.
Gather all your materials in a
well ventilated spot with lots of
light. It helps to have enough room
so that you can spread your stuff
out and still have room to move
around. Do not under estimate the
value of good light, especially if
you are going to replicate your
subject's color with any degree of
accuracy.
Start by spreading a layer of
modeling clay out upon your
board. For most bifaces, a thick­
ness of one-half inch or so should
suffice. At least half the thickness
of your artifact is desirable. The
surface area of the clay layer
should be about four times greater
than the object to be cast. This
should provide plenty of room for
your mold. Trace your item with a
nonmetal object onto the center of
your clay layer. Scoop out the in­
terior of this impression so that
about half of the artifact remains
above the surface of the clay. If
you have not yet utilized your ra­
dio you should do so now, this

next part is tedious.
Now press the clay up to the
edge of the item so that no space
remains. Exactly half of your sub­
ject should be "buried" within the
clay. All portions of your object
that are still exposed will be cast in
the first half of your mold. Small
snakes of clay can be fashioned
and impressed along the objects
edge to ensure that only the proper
portion is visible. You will want to
ensure the clay follows the edge of
your biface as accurately as possi­
ble. A pointed wooden tool will
help to define the bifaces true
edge. This takes practice and can
be quite slow. If you are casting an
object other than a biface then
where the two mold halves meet
can be fairly arbitrary. Once you
are satisfied with the surface area
that the first mold half will cover,
you can proceed ~o the next step.
Use a dime to create several
"keys" within the clay about one
inch from the artifact. This will al­
low the two mold halves to fit to­
gether correctly (if you are making
a one-sided mold you can of
course skip this step). Construct a
"dam" with your card board strips
outside the circle of keys. Push the
strips into the clay so no liquid can
escape the enclosure. Spray mist
the clay and artifact. You may also
use Vaseline at this point to ensure
that the Alganate will not stick to
the clay layer. Don't use too much
or your mold will be distorted by
the unsightly globs.
Next take a portion ofyour Al­
ganate powder roughly propor­
(Continued on page 23)

--

(Continued from page 22)

tional to the object to be cast. Pour
it into a mixing container. Mix in
water until you have a 2: 1 ratio of
water to Alganate. Stir until a con­
sistency of oatmeal has been
reached. Pour the compound into
the dam. Lightly tap the board on
your working surface to encour­
age the air bubbles to rise away
from the artifact surface. The Al­
ganate will set in three minutes.
Make sure you are ready to carry
this step out quickly before start­
ing. While the first part of your
mold is setting you need to decide
whether or not your object is big
enough to require a plaster jacket.
This jacket will give support to
your Alganate mold during casting
and drying. Most bifaces won't re­
quire the extra support, but better
safe than sorry if you are not likely
to get another shot at the object.
If you decided to go with the
plaster jacket you can make sev­
eral keys in the clay just outside
your dam (once again, skip this
step for one piece molds). Once
the mold has set you can peel away
your cardboard dam. You may
want to use a sharp object to
scrape away some of the excess
mold material. This will result in a
smaller mold that is easier to han­
dle. Be sure not to come near the
casted object itselfwhile doing so.
Take your cardboard strips
and fashion a new dam 2-3 inches
around the Alganate mold. Make
sure to include your keys if making
a two-part mold. Wet your paper
towels and lay them over the clay
and inner mold so that they con­

----- - - - - - - - - - -

form to the surface well. This will
prevent the plaster from bonding
with the clay or the Alganate. Now
get ready to mix your dental-grade
plaster. Pour water into your
(clean) mixing container. The wa­
ter should be about the same vol­
ume as the Alganate mold you are
covering. Pour in plaster slowly
until it begins to form an island in
the water. Pour in a little more for
good measure and allow the mix to
sit a moment. Now mix. The plas­
ter will be stronger if mixed well
so put some effort into it. When
the mix feels like yogurt, pour it
into your new dam. Optionally,
small pieces of burlap or another
porous material can be placed
within layers of your plaster jacket
to strengthen the jacket. Again,
smaller pieces should be fine with­
out this extra work.
The plaster should set com­
pletely in about 10 minutes. You
can sculpt the plaster jacket with
your hands to give a smooth sur­
face. This will make it easier to
handle when you agitate it later.
You may want to clean up your
area while the plaster is drying.
Once the plaster is dry, flip the
entire mold over-board, clay, and
all. Remove the board and peel off
your clay layer exposing the ven­
tral side of your original object.
Remove any errant clay with a
damp cloth or sponge.
If you are making a one-piece
mold you are now finished! If a
two-piece mold was your objec­
tive, you can now repeat the pro­
cess for the other half Wet the
mold and biface, construct a clay

- - - - - - - - - -

dam on top of and around the first
half of the mold you have just
made, mix your Alganate, and
pour it inside the dam, directly
onto the other half of the object.
Allow to dry. Moisten the surface
of the first mold half This can be
done either with mineral oil or us­
ing the paper towel method again.
Allow the plaster to dry. You can
now separate your two mold
halves and remove your original
object.
Pouring the cast is relatively
easy. Layout the two halves of the
mold side by side with your rubber
bands at the ready. Mix a small
amount of the dental plaster, just
enough to fill the mold will be fine.
Mix the plaster slowly in a figure
eight pattern to cut down on ac­
cursed air bubbles. Air bubbles are
the bane of all casting enthusiasts
and looked upon with the same
amount of brotherly love excava­
tors feel toward fire ants.
Paint a thin coat of the plaster
onto the inner surface ofthe dorsal
mold. Keep it thin enough so that
you can flip it over without plaster
dripping everywhere. Paint plaster
in the ventral mold as well, ensur­
ing that the plaster goes all the
way to the edge of the impression.
Mound some plaster in the middle
of the ventral mold so that there
will be plenty of compound to fill
the mold completely. Now,
quickly place the dorsal half onto
the ventral half It is important that
the keys line up properly and the
mold closes tightly. Otherwise
there will be plaster all over your

GEOARCHEOLOGY ON THE SoUTH

;;

TEXAS CoASTAL PLAIN

by Richard Stark
The 1995 University of Texas
Archeological Field School intro­
duced students to geoarcheologi­
cal field methods at the River Spur
site on the Guadalupe River in
Victoria, Texas. Under the leader­
ship of Dr. Michael B. Collins and
Dr. Thomas R. Hester, a crew of
30 students (21 undergraduates
and 9 graduate students) headed
south from Austin on June 7 with
plans for a large-scale block exca­
vation at the site, located at River­
side Park. Some additional testing
was also expected at the second

location of the Mission Espiritu
Santo, also in Victoria County.
Archaeology at both of these sites
was to be interpreted using inte­
grative geological and archeologi­
cal methods.
THE RIVER SPUR SITE

{41VT112}
Previous testing at River Spur
by the Office of the State Archeol­
ogist (OSA) yielded Clear Fork
tools along with Early Archaic and
Late Paleoindian projectile points.
Included amongst these was a

heavily patinated Scottsbluff-like
point. We hoped to locate the Late
Paleoindian components and de­
termine their nature and their posi­
tion. An unequivocal chronology
with secure radiocarbon dates has
never been established for the
Clear Fork tool or for the Scotts­
bluff variants found on the South­
ern Coastal Plains.

hands and not in the mold. Use the
rubber bands or two strips of inner
tube tied into bands to hold the
mold together.
Now to fight those air bubbles.
Agitate the mold by turning it end
over end in multiple directions.
Any pockets of air will gravitate to
the object's center where they will
not be seen. Keep this up for about
five minutes. This can be good ex­
ercise if you are casting a large bi­
face in plaster jackets.
Allow the mold to sit for at
least 15-20 minutes. I prefer to
wait a half hour or so. You may
then remove your mold bands and
separate the two halves. If life is

good, a complete plaster replica of
your original object will be sitting
before you. You can probably get
2-3 more casts from this mold be­
fore it shrinks too much. Keeping
the mold moist and cool will slow
this drying down. It would be best
to let the casts dry overnight be­
fore painting them. Any paint
should work fine. Cheap acrylic
paints are readily available at any
craft store.
Because this mold sets so fast
it can be used directly in the field
despite humidity. In fact, you can
even make the Alganate mold un­
derwater if need be. Unfortunately
the mold is only temporary and the
plaster casts are somewhat fragile.

They still make excellent displays
and are better than no cast at all.
Alternatively, you can use
Geltate and Resin as casting medi­
ums. Geltate is a dental grade
molding compound that creates a
11 permanent " mold. It costs about
$25.00 per pound and must be
specially ordered. Resins are great
casting mediums but are somewhat
more expensive than plaster and
require much longer to dry. They
can be tinted as well. This means
that very accurate colors can be
reproduced as well as translu­
cency. Oil paint works best for
surface colors. Acrylic tends to ad­
here poorly to many resins ..2J

A 4-x-5-m block was estab­
lished adjacent to the backhoe
trench and test pits dug by the
OSA 1993. A backhoe was used
to remove approximately 1.5 m of
culturally sterile overburden. Ken
Brown kept busy reestablishing
the grid and forming a site map
with the Total Data Station
(TDS). Excavation in the block
was under a shade screen gener­
ously provided and erected by
DuPont Corporation. Six l-x-l-m
pits were also excavated lower on
the slope on a line running
north/south. The sediments were
water screened. Close attention
was paid to the nature of sedi­
ments and soils encountered in the
excavation and exposed in nearby
stream banks.
WHAT WE FOUND ••• AND
DIDN'T FIND

After several weeks of digging
and screening, excavation in the
block was abandoned and we con­
centrated our efforts down lower
on the slope. Here cultural materi­
als were more abundant, however;
the levels containing the bulk of
the lithic materials were also
tainted with cigarette butts, plas­
tic, and other recent materials.
Preliminary interpretations in­
dicate that the block excavation
was situated in the fill of an old
Guadalupe River channel. Sedi­
ment deposition here was low en­
ergy, much like a swale or oxbow
lake fill, with heavy clay deposi­
tion occurring. The gravel bar

next to this channel was likely the
spot of a substantial late Paleoin­
dian and Early Archaic camp. Un­
fortunately for the preservation of
the archeology, the small tributary
creek following the abandoned
Guadalupe River channel was
channelized and dredged repeat­
edly starting earlier this century.
Hence, the bulk of the River Spur
site appears to have been partially
(largely?) redeposited In sec­
ondary context.
Turning our disappointment
into a learning experience, Drs.
Collins and Hester used the River
Spur site as an example of archeol­
ogy in the real world. Due to the
low frequency of artifacts at the
site, students were able to concen­
trate on the stratigraphy and geo­
morphological aspects of River
Spur.
In tandem with this field
geoarcheological experience were
evening lectures on South Texas
archeology,
geology,
and
geoarcheology.
Lecturers in­
cluded Gene Mear on local geol­
ogy, Ken Brown on the Berger
Bluff Paleoindian site, Dr. Paul
Goldberg on microstratigraphy
techniques, Dr. Steve Hall on paly­
nology and alluvial geology, Jeff
Huebner on prehistoric diet in the
coastal plains, Dr. Thomas R. Hes­
ter on the archeology of South
Texas, mission archeology, and
the archeology of the south and
central Texas Coast, and Dr.
Michael B. Collins on geoarcheol­
ogy and fluvial geology. The com­
bination of fieldwork and these
lectures made UTFS 1995 an en­

tertaining, exciting, and wonder­
fully educational experience. Al­
though the artifact count was low,
the data collected on Guadalupe
River geomorphology was exten­
sive and the learning experience
for 30 students was immeasurable.
Several groups and individuals

Many of you will also remem­
ber Tom as a person who was very
generous with his time and re­
sources. One night in 1975 on a
south Texas field school, I was
awakened by Tom, pistol in hand,
telling me that there were
"intruders in camp" and that he
had been shadowing them for a
couple of hours. We later found
the two lost and exhausted illegal
aliens, fed them breakfast, and
Tom gave them each a $20 bill be­
fore they continued their trek to­
ward San Antonio! He could
strike up a friendship with just
about anybody, and he went out of
his way to be helpful. Indeed, my
first introduction to Tom Kelly

I

IN MEMORIAM
(Continuedfrom page 26)

was as a high school student in
1964, when Tom was commanding
Mildenhall Air Force Base in Eng­
land-and took the time to write
me about archeology and to send
along a little box of English arrow
points that I use in my classroom
teaching to this day.
Our paths didn't actually cross
until 1974 when I was teaching at
UT-San Antonio and got to meet
Tom personally for the first time.
For those of you who might not
know about Tom's second career
in archeology, he had been in­
volved as an amateur archeologist
in Texas since the 1950s, digging
and publishing several important
sites. But with the opportunities
at UTSA, he started taking arche­
ology courses, got involved in the
development of the Center for Ar­
chaeological Research, helped to
found the Southern Texas Archae­
ological Association, went off on
various field surveys and excava­
tions, and later got his MA degree
-Tom Kelly never did anything
halfway!
Tom made many contributions
to archeology. Much of his work
was in Texas, and in the past
decade, he devoted much time to
the study of its Paleoindian cul­
tures of 10-11,000 years ago. But
after we got him to Belize in 1979,
the archeology and the country be­
came his passion. He was literally
unstoppable at surveying the
densest jungle and enthusiasti­
cally reporting his many discover­
ies. Among these was the earliest

evidence of human occupation in
that central American country
around 11,200 years ago. He also
became the leader in studying the
peoples who preceded the Maya,
and in 1993 published a major pa­
per in an international journal
(Ancient Mesoamerica 4[2]) on
the Belize Preceramic. He showed
me and Harry Shafer these sites
and talked about the kinds ofwork
that ought to be done at each. Just
two months ago (March 1995), we
carried out work at the Kelly site,
one of these preceramic sites that
he found and which is named in
his honor. His contributions in this
area will be felt for a long time.
Now, everyone should under­
stand the importance of Tom's ac­
complishments as an Air Force of­
ficer and as an archeologist, but
you should also be aware ofall the
friendships that Tom established
in these endeavors. And all the
fun he had and the fun that he cre­
ated for those around him. I
couldn't even start to tell you
"Tom Kelly stories" this after­
noon; he is truly a legend among
those who worked with him. Let
me share one that was a favorite of
his. In 1979, Tom, CoL Ned Har­
ris, Harry Shafer, and I arrived at
the Belize airport during a tremen­
dous January rainstorm. There to
greet us and haul us to our camp
47 miles away was Erwin Roemer
(one of Tom's favorite people-­
Erwin married his wife Kathy dur­
ing a later season at Colha and
Tom loaned them his pickup for
their honeymoon). All Erwin had

was a small Chevrolet EI Camino
pickup. With all our gear and all
the people, we squeezed ourselves
into the cab, and in the back of
that greatly overloaded pickup,
and chugged up the old Northern
Highway toward camp. Well,
Harry Shafer, Tom, and I got
stuck (or perhaps we volunteered)
in the back of the pickup, hud­
dling under a tarp, with the rain
pouring down and the winds of
this rare Belizean "norther" freez­
ing us to death! Was there no re­
lief from this, Harry and I whined.
Tom decided we were all too mis­
erable and began burrowing down
into the baggage, coming up with
a bottle of his favorite Scotch­
which we all proceeded to share.
We warmed up immediately and I
can't recall much of the rain, or the
trip, after that!
And, as you all know, Tom
loved parties-barbeques, cook­
ing steaks and fish, often in his
backyard on Sharon Drive. In our
camps in Belize, whenever we got
tired of rice and beans, Tom
would go off fishing with John
Masson and come back with, as he
always proclaimed "enough fish
to feed the whole camp" and he
cooked it up for us with great glee.
Tom had so many friends, many
here today. We are fortunate that
we, and the members of Tom!s
family, all have our own personal
memories and "Tom Kelly sto­
ries" to help us through this time
of loss-and to help us long re­
member this remarkable man.~

for the presidio, one anives at 5.25 leagues (13 .80 miles) to
less than 7 leagues (less than 18.41 miles). This would place
the sites in the Victoria area, fur short ofthe Mission Valley
location By adding the 3 leagues (7.89 miles) that both
Bustillo and Almazan tell us was the place then chosen for
the larger mission, we get a distance of21.04 miles to 26.30
miles. The distance from 41Vf4, the site ofthe Presidio
Nuestra Senora de Loreto on Garcitas Creek, to the Victoria
City Park area is approximately 21 miles. The 26.30 miles is
fairly close to the approximate distance of 27 miles from
41Vf4 to 41Vfn. Additionally, the 3 leagues (or 7.89
miles) given as the distance betweenthe second (Interim) site
and the Mission Valley site closely matches the approximate
7.09 miles between Victoria (as measured from the
TonkawaBluffsite) and 41 Vfll.
Documentary evidence thus points to three mission
sites. The first site on Garcitas Creek is yet unlocated. The
second, or interim site was apparently in the immediate area
ofpresent-day Victoria. The third location was at 41Vf11,
where the University of Texas at Austin field school con­
ducted archeological investigations in summer 1995.
