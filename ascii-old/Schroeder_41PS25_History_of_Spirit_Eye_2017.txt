The History of Spirit Eye Cave
By Bryon Schroeder
Introduction
Spirit Eye Cave (41PS25) is a prehistorically occupied cave system located in Presidio County, Texas,
just north of the Chinati Mountains. The cave system is on the lowest level of a north-south trending
limestone tiered cliff. Access is possible via two entrances, lower and upper entrances that lead to a
central U-shaped main chamber. Internally there are two explored shafts—Shaft A and Shaft B—and two
recently discovered shafts—a small, partially buried Shaft C and a vertical Shaft D. All shafts connect to
the main chamber. Extensive prehistoric use of the cave is evident in the well-developed cultural talus
deposit which is laden with thousands of pieces of debitage, various ground and chipped stone tools, and
a distinct black anthropogenic soil that comprises the slope outside the cave. There are also historic food
and beverage containers on this talus slope as evidence of the years of amateur excavation into the rich
and well-preserved prehistoric deposits.
In many regards, the history of Spirit Eye is as complex as the archaeological deposits it contains.
Artifact collectors from Texas north toward Colorado knew of the rich prehistoric deposits inside Spirit
Eye, and there is no doubt many of these individuals dug inside the chamber of the cave over multiple
decades. We can account for some of these looting episodes, some we cannot, and while the exact history
of collecting will in all likelihood remain murky, the intensity and destruction of their exploits is very
clear. Outside both entrances are the first indicators of destruction—mounds of screened cave fill almost
three meters tall. The area near the lower entrance, moving into the internal chamber, resembles a
mineshaft from untold looting exploits. Near the upper entrance, from the back wall of the cave to the
opening, is a large, stratified mound of looted cave fill over a meter tall, itself profiled by looting
episodes. The persons who mined Spirit Eye were all after the same thing: the unique perishable artifacts
that this cave preserved.
The artifact assemblage from Spirit Eye offers a unique and holistic view into technologies that
made the prehistoric adaptation to the Chihuahuan Desert possible. In an effort to salvage some of this
valuable information, the Center for Big Bend Studies (CBBS) of Sul Ross State University (SRSU)
began the first systematic excavations in the cave in early May of 2017. In operationalizing the
excavation, we knew it would be important to understand the periods of looting, and what has emerged is
a complex and storied history. By the 1960s, artifact collectors at Spirit Eye conducted intense periods of
excavation fueled by both black market values and personal curiosity. Understanding this history has
enabled us to relocate and claim orphaned collections in facilities such as the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and private collections, all of which contain unrivaled artifact assemblages.
Our goal is to understand how the years of unsystematic excavation progressed and to develop
research methods that can be used to salvage data from this and other extensively looted archaeological
sites. Although our work is ongoing, we have already recovered thousands of artifacts discarded by
collectors, most of them perishables. Not surprisingly, these include domestic artifacts like quids, human
coprolites, cordage, various kinds of processed plant fiber, faunal artifacts, foodstuffs, and carved wooden
artifacts. The site, although impacted, still holds far-reaching research potential that requires an
unconventional research design. We are very much at the beginning stages of this research, but it is
obvious that we can use Spirit Eye as a laboratory to push the possibilities of research in perishable
artifact analysis.
Why the History of Looting Matters
This document details the chronological history of nonprofessional excavations at Spirit Eye. It presents
them in chronological order in an effort to understand how each subsequent episode of excavation
affected the prehistoric cultural deposits within the main chamber. The years of uncontrolled excavation
have left an indelible mark on the site. My hope is to understand how this history progressed, who was
involved, why they were involved, and where they targeted their excavations. We can use this work as a

2
template to reconstruct the deposits within the cave as we excavate the upper entrance backdirt pile and
operationalize our research.
Looted sites have research potential, but they require unconventional research designs. The
literature on looted site investigation ranges from cultural heritage management and preservation on a
world stage to more focused site-specific treatises. What is evident is that no two situations are similar.
Cultural heritage issues often center on looting in war-torn countries and the disparities between affected
cultural groups and occupiers and the complex values (e.g., monetary, research, notoriety, and prestige)
that each ascribe to the archaeological record. In these situations, time and scarcity add value to the
archaeological record, but only when there is a market (often created by demand in developed countries).
This research shows the importance of understanding why individuals loot archaeological sites and offers
inroads for addressing social problems that lead to the destruction of archaeological sites (cf. Kersel and
Cheeson 2013). The more site-specific examples offer creative ways to gather scientific data from
disturbed sites that are in many instances specific to the archaeology of the site (cf. Lundeen 1997). What
is at the core of both world heritage and local looting site research is the detailed reconstruction of the
historical events that led to the present condition of the sites. What follows is the history of both looting
and professional involvement that ends with our present research at Spirit Eye—a timeline to anchor our
continuing efforts.

1958
The first listed date on file for Spirit Eye is with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) for a site
number request in 1958. This date is suspected to be wrong. It is more probable that the El Paso
Archaeological Society (EPAS) requested the site number after a late 1968 field visit and there is a
typographical error in the THC database.

Early 1960s
The first documented account of activity at Spirit Eye is an undated, anonymous letter recounting an
expedition; the letter was accompanied by pictures of a mummified male individual, which is currently
housed at the West of the Pecos Museum, Pecos, Texas. The letter is thought to be written by Rex Owens
or one of the Burkholders—members of a nonprofessional excavation of the cave during the 1960s (see
the “2006–2011” section of this paper). The typed letter describes a single day of uncontrolled excavation
in the cave by a cast of characters that include Rex “Skippy” Owens, Welty (sp?) Wright, Bob
Burkholder, Steve Burkholder, and Big John (aka Johnny Burkholder). The anonymous letter describes
the distinct double opening of Spirit Eye and the numerous groundstone metates that mark both entrances.
The author details what the group collected, as well as who excavated and who screened. The recovered
materials included an atlatl dart foreshaft; “lots of strings”; sandals of rawhide and cactus fiber; a laced
skin bag or quiver; numerous projectile points, one with the remnants of hafting material; various kinds of
well-preserved faunal and floral material; and large pieces of basketry (Figs. 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d).
Their most consequential finding was a partially mummified adult male buried in a flexed
position. The individual was found “40 feet from the front” with no clothing and was not “tied” in any
way. Prior to discussing the recovery of the burial, the unknown author states, “All points found were the
same as the ones I have found around Pecos,” signifying the group had come to the cave from Pecos,
Texas. The importance of that statement is that an adult male mummy and artifacts as described in the
letter surfaced years later in the West of the Pecos Museum in Pecos, Texas. The letter states that the
group did not return to Spirit Eye because of the dust, but does say, “We could see other caves and cliffs,
which we will at a later date explore.”

Fall and Winter of 1968
The most well-documented period of extensive amateur interest and excavation begins with the discovery
of another prehistoric burial. On September 15, 1968, a Mr. Clabough and Ken Novak uncovered a burial,
capped by a large stone, which contained a well-preserved, flexed, prehistoric individual (thought to be
female). The following day Mr. Clabough phoned The University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin)
regarding the burial and talked to a Mr. Shafer (presumably Harry Shafer), who instructed him to write a
detailed letter to Dr. T.N. Campbell, also of UT-Austin. Ken Novak wrote the letter on September 16,
1968, detailing the recently discovered burial and describing the results of their two years of uncontrolled
excavation in the cave. This description included several rough sketches of recovered projectile points,
the location of the burial, a basic sketch map that detailed the extent of their excavation in the internal
chamber, and a list of additional discoveries.
There was some internal dialogue between Dr. Campbell and other UT-Austin faculty members
regarding a course of action. On September 25, 1968, Thomas Roy Hester of UT-Austin wrote to Rex
Gerald of the Centennial Museum at El Paso regarding Ken Novak’s letter; on the same day he also wrote
a letter to Mr. Novak directly to inform him that he had sent a letter to Mr. Gerald. In the letter to Novak,
Hester informed him that personnel from UT-Austin were not located near the cave and that Mr. Gerald
would contact him directly about visitation; he thanked Novak for reaching out and asked him to place the
location on a topographic map and fill out a brief survey form. On September 27, 1968, Frank W. Eddy,
executive director of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) at UT-Austin, wrote to Mr. Gerald.
Both Novak’s and Eddy’s letters to Gerald contained a copy of Novak’s original letter and quote
descriptions of Novak’s self-described finds from the cave.
Rex Gerald passed all of the letters and information to Leslie Davis and Jack Hedrick of the El
Paso Archeological Society (EPAS). On October 2, 1968, Leslie Davis wrote to Albert Schroeder, the
regional interpretive archaeologist with the National Park Service in Santa Fe, New Mexico, detailing the
chain of the September correspondence. In the letter, Davis bulleted six reasons for EPAS to be involved
with the cave excavation, and requested the aid of a federal archaeologist stationed in Fort Davis. He also
laid out how the work should progress, with four phases: (1) begin with an initial scouting trip, (2)
transition to a full excavation crew, (3) perform analysis, and (4) produce a final report. There are some
important details in the letter that Davis got wrong or are not represented in any of the previous
correspondence.
Leslie Davis’ letter states that part of the reason for Ken Novak’s request for additional aid by
professionals is his intention to exhume two additional burials. However, none of the correspondence
with anyone outside of Davis or subsequent maps created by EPAS denote more than a single burial in
the cave. The sketches provided by Novak himself only indicated the single flexed burial he described
and illustrated in his original letter. The number “2” is used in the original letter to describe the diameter
of corncobs found inside the cave, and this may have been misread (as it seems Davis is writing from his
memory and not quoting the actual letter); the handwriting is difficult to read in later copies of the
correspondence. Davis also misrepresents the lack of enthusiasm by UT-Austin to aid Novak and it is a
point that Albert Schroeder directly responds to.
On October 8, 1968, Albert Schroeder wrote back to Leslie Davis after contacting Thomas Roy
Hester at UT-Austin. Schroeder explained to Davis that, although the faculty at UT-Austin was busy, they
were interested in the cave and would like Davis to contact them to confirm the EPAS plans to visit the
cave. He reminded Davis that there was no federal archaeologist stationed at Fort Davis. Also on October
8, 1968, Jack Hedrick of EPAS wrote to Ken Novak directly to let him know that Rex Gerald referred the
matter of the cave to him. Hedrick advised Novak to contact the superintendent of the Fort Davis
Historical Site, Franklin G. Smith, and if he did not hear anything from Mr. Smith, EPAS would assist
with the work.
A letter dated October 21, 1968, from Jack Hedrick to Thomas Hester discussed a plan to meet
with Larry Clabough and Ken Novak at the Thunderbird Restaurant in Marfa, Texas. The purpose of the

5
trip was to assess the access to the site, as well as perform an initial recording. Hedrick went on to request
professional aid in the preliminary survey of the cave, and instructed Hester to call him by October 26 so
that he could be incorporated into the plans if he could attend. This letter was given to Robert K.
Alexander of TASP, who wrote to Hedrick directly on October 26, 1968.
Alexander had just finished a second season of excavation in a rockshelter at Amistad Reservoir
with “dried plant remains dating from Early through Late Archaic.” In the letter, he told Hedrick that he
could not attend the planned expedition but he was interested in comparing any similar material they
excavated from “the Chinati Mtn. cave.” He made himself available for questions and closed the letter by
telling Hedrick that any information on the site, particularly regarding the condition and type of organic
artifacts, would be appreciated. Presumably, Thomas Hester also did not show up for the initial visit to
Spirit Eye, so the trip proceeded without any professional archaeologists.
The meeting between the EPAS group, Ken Novak, and Larry Clabough must have occurred
because we have photos that the EPAS group took of Ken Novak’s collection that match the sketches that
accompanied his first letter (Figs. 3 and 4). However, if the two looters actually led EPAS to Spirit Eye is
not clear because there are only rudimentary notes by John W. Green of EPAS dated November 3, 1968.
The existing notes include outline sketches, not drawn to scale, of various ground and chipped stone tools
cataloged at “one of the openings.” Green also apparently sketched a rough site map, placing the location
of the burial and several other items that might suggest Ken Novak had accompanied them. This initial
visit provided Green with the locational information to request a site number for the cave. It was also
enough to get EPAS and various members of the Texas Archaeological society (TAS) from across West
Texas interested in a site visit.
On December 28, 1968, 19 members of EPAS and various members of TAS signed a roster at the
Ruidosa Hot Springs at 5:00 p.m. for the “Mt. Chinati Expedition.” This roster does not include Leslie
Davis or Jack Hedrick’s signatures but presumably they were present to lead the excavation. My phone
interview with Evans Turpin confirmed that the group stayed at the Ruidosa Hot Springs and transported
a generator and lights to the cave. The work they accomplished is unclear (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). The
notes that exist are from an excavation but are faded. There is later correspondence with Hedrick’s wife
that suggests they excavated a single test unit in the cave during the December 1968 trip. The artifacts
from this excavation that had been housed at the EPAS lab in El Paso were transferred to the CBBS on
June 7, 2017.

1969
On February 4, 1969, Ken Novak wrote to Thomas Hester at UT-Austin regarding some publications that
he wanted to obtain. In the same letter, he asked Hester if he had heard anything from the EPAS group
regarding their work in the cave. The letter stated that Novak had initially taken an EPAS group to the
cave; the group was impressed and found artifacts but he had not heard anything back since

12
Thanksgiving. He ended the letter by stating he looked forward to working with UT-Austin again. We
have not found a letter from Hester back to Novak.

1988
There is a lull in the archived correspondence regarding the site for all of the 1970s and early 1980s. One
of the more bizarre chapters of the Spirit Eye story begins with an ad in The Shotgun magazine on
October 1, 1988 for an “Ancient Burial and Cultural Display Collection (Fig. 9). This ad was brought to
the attention of Thomas Hester in a letter written by Rochelle J. Leneave of the Center for Archaeological
Research at UT-San Antonio; there is no additional archived correspondence between the two. The ad
was successful; the mummified woman from Spirit Eye was purchased sometime in early October of that
year.
On October 31, 1988, Adrian Benke (the seller) sent a letter to Bob Howard (the buyer) who
resided in Palm Springs, California. The letter describes Howard’s recent purchase and is the only
correspondence we have between the seller and the buyer. In his letter, Benke takes some creative license
in describing much of the background information concerning the mummified woman. Benke portrays the
environmental setting as a craggy wasteland with little vegetation; he falsely claimed that Texas Governor
Dolph Briscoe shut down excavations by the University of Texas and the University of New Mexico in
the cave after Briscoe purchased the land, and provided a lengthy opinion of site use and associated
artifacts. He ends with the tired idea of “where these Indians came from and what happened to them is
also unknown, they came to this harsh environment, survived for several hundred years, then
disappeared.” There is no correspondence discussing how the female individual and associated artifacts
were transported to California.

Figure 9. The ad that appeared in the October edition of The Shotgun magazine.

1998
Bob Howard displayed the woman from Spirit Eye in his living room until the summer of 1998 when his
illicit trafficking of exotic wildlife set her recovery in motion. Sometime in early June of 1998, the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife entered the home of Bob Howard with a search warrant to
recover protected wildlife. The Fish and Wildlife agents immediately noticed the human remains in the
living room and called the Riverside County Coroner. The coroner’s report details the initial visit by
Deborah Gray, a forensic archaeologist on June 12, 1998. Gray was careful not to touch the woman or
handle the artifacts; her initial report makes it clear she thought the individual was from either the
American Southwest or the Great Basin because of the associated artifacts. But it was in the letter from
Benke to Howard, kept in close proximity to the mummy, that put Gray in contact with the State of
Texas.

13
In Riverside County, California, unidentified remains are housed at California State University,
Fullerton. However, Gray established contact with the Texas Office of the State Archeologist and later
TARL to ensure the remains were returned to the state of origin. A conversation between the TARL lab
director, Thomas Hester, and Gray established a plan for shipping. On August 27, 1998, the woman from
Spirit Eye was placed on American Airlines Flight 1945 to Austin, scheduled to arrive at 4:38 p.m. She
was, however, misplaced at a stop in Dallas and did not arrive until August 28 at 10:35 a.m. The woman
and associated artifacts are now housed at the Human Osteology Collection at TARL in Austin (Figs. 10a
and 10b). This later history is outlined in an April 1999 report written by Rosario Casarez of TARL.
With the return of the woman from Spirit Eye to TARL, a chapter of the intense 1960s looting
seemed to close and what follows are the first visits to the site by CBBS professional archaeologists.
Because of the obvious scar that the years of looting had caused to the site, professional interest had been
tepid.

Early 2000s
In 2002 the then-director of CBBS, Robert J. (Bob) Mallouf, visited Spirit Eye with landowner Jeff Fort
and John Karges of the Texas Nature Conservancy. They documented the main chamber of the site and
designated Shaft A as the larger shaft system and Shaft B as the crawl-space-only system. The photos that
accompany the notes indicate much of the site was left untouched from the early 2000s to the present day.
The shaker screen recently removed from the site and metates still at the entrances are visible in the file
photos from 2002/2003. The internal chamber appears to be as impacted in the 2002/2003 photos as it is
presently. There are no early 2000s pictures of the upper entrance backdirt pile, but we do know that this
was looted sometime in late 2006 or early 2007.
In 2003, Bob Mallouf returned with landowner Jeff Fort and helicopter pilot Joe Reed and took
additional pictures and notes, “no rock art observed terrible pot-hunting . . . screens inside and out.” On
this trip the group found a “Marcos style projectile in the huge steep talus,” leading up to the cave.

2005
In 2005, John Seebach from the CBBS pulled 3 artifacts from the Jack Hedrick Collection on loan to the
CBBS from the Museum of the Big Bend at SRSU. Along with three artifacts from Mallouf’s 2003 site
visit, he completed outline drawings (five projectile points and a hafted biface) and made notes of
measurements, material descriptions, and temporal designations. The artifacts represent Middle/Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods. The material from the Hedrick collection is undoubtedly
associated with Hedrick’s 1968 site visit with EPAS, but there are no associated notes.
There is a short field book entry by Bob Mallouf for a May 13, 2005, Spirit Eye re-evaluation trip
where the three artifacts from Mallouf’s 2003 site visit that accompany the Hedrick Collection material
were recovered “from the base of the cultural talus.”

2006–2011
On December 21, 2006, Glenn Justice wrote a blog entitled “The Chinati Mountain Mummy
(http://www.rimrockpress.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry061221-051209). In it, Justice rephrases the
early 1960s account of the discovery of the male individual from the cave. He attributes the authorship of
the letter to Rex “Skippy” Owens and highlights the same series of findings outlined in the early 1960s
section of this report. The blog entry is antagonistic towards the lack of professional interest. In it he says
“. . . no archaeologist could be found who was willing to study or even consider this remarkable find.
Even the age of the mummy will never be know (sic) since no Radio Carbon 14 dating was never (sic)
performed.” The male individual was removed from display at the West of the Pecos Museum, although it
likely remains in the museum’s holdings.
In my conversations with Justice, he said Rex Owens gave him the notes, remembered excavating
in the cave, took Justice to the cave, and donated all of the recovered artifacts as well as the male

14
individual to the West of the Pecos Museum. The blog entry is the culmination of the site visit and
conversations between these two friends.

16
An internal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) email was sent on April 19, 2007, from Dan
Barnes, the lead agent of the infamous Blanding, Utah Case (2007–2009), soliciting information
regarding the location of a cave. There are several responses listed on the email before it makes it to Bill
Skiles at the General Land Office (GLO), who then talks to Bob Mallouf. Skiles responds on Mallouf’s
behalf that it is Spirit Eye Cave. There are pictures that accompany the text and these show three distinct
individuals digging the upper entrance to the cave (Figs. 11, 12a, 12b, and 12c). There is a picture of the
screen in use by an individual that was later abandoned and appears in the 2003 Mallouf photographs.
These individuals bisected the backdirt pile at the upper entrance and dug a wide section down to
bedrock. The steep profiled face of the upper entrance backdirt pile is a direct result of their activity and it
is where our most recent excavation began. I do not know what happened to the individuals in the photos,
but since they were involved in looting sites on federal land, they may have been prosecuted.

There was an October 12, 2007, visit to the cave by landowner Jeff Fort and he collected a single
brown chert projectile point tip. There are not accompanying notes. A similar trip occurred on November
11, 2011, and two projectile points were recovered from the cultural talus. There are also no
accompanying notes and it is the last noted trip before our most recent effort.
Current Efforts
The first full-time research effort into Spirit Eye by CBBS began with a site visit in March of 2017. By
May of 2017, the first excavations were taking place within the cave. This historical outline is a product
of this latest effort.

Unsubstantiated Looting Episodes
David Keller of the CBBS, in researching the history of Pinto Canyon, said, “Clementine Bales, Marfa,
told us that her husband Sherman Bales caught Richard Fenker (who owned the hot springs before Jeff
Fort) digging in there and got very upset with him over it. I interviewed Fenker but, of course, he made no
mention of it.” Now that we better understand the history of the cave and what was found inside of it, I
will personally reach out to Fenker.
Homer Mills, ranch manager of the 02 Ranch, believes the Pierce family of Marfa, Texas, spent
time in the cave excavating, but in phone conversations between David Pierce and Bob Mallouf, he
maintains that he was too young at the time to remember being in the cave and did not possess artifacts.
Bob Mallouf said their involvement would have been in the 1950s and they would have been among the
first to dig in the cave.
Several Border Patrol agents have confessed to looting in the cultural deposits in the main
chamber. There are interviews scheduled with these individuals as we need to corroborate the dates they
were there, where they dug, what they found, and where those artifacts are now.

Collections
There are collections of artifacts from Spirit Eye housed at EPAS, TARL, CBBS-SRSU, West of the
Pecos Museum, as well as in private collections. We hold the bulk of the collection and, because of our
ongoing research, I requested that EPAS relinquish their collection to the CBBS. Their board approved
the transfer, and on June 7, 2017, I moved the collection from El Paso to the CBBS lab.
Rex Owens, who looted the adult male from the cave, eventually moved to Eden, Arizona, and
donated a large portion of his collection to the Graham County Historical Society Museum in Thatcher,
Arizona. The museum is now permanently closed and the artifacts are housed in a storage facility. We
repeatedly made contact with several members of the defunct museum board (Toni Williams and Hal
Herbert, de facto secretary) and, after much persistence, they checked their collection and associated files.
They are adamant that Rex Owens only donated artifacts from his land in Arizona and denied our requests
to view the collection.
The collection at TARL represents a portion of what was looted from the cave in 1968. We can
gain access to these materials and we have an open invitation; they require a research design to access
human remains and I am actively working on that. They will let us do destructive analysis on artifacts, but
that too requires a research design.
There are additional artifacts held in private collections. Ken Novak did not give his collection to
the members of EPAS but they were able to photograph a portion of it. The looters from Colorado
presumably took artifacts from the cave but the whereabouts are unknown. I have tried to make contact
with Dan Barnes, but contact is difficult because he is fighting civil suits due to his role in the Blanding,
Utah looting case (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/us/21blanding.html).

Conclusion
The protracted looting at Spirit Eye did affect the deposits in the main chamber. Now that we understand
some of the history, we can isolate where looters focused; my hope is to interpret their looted backdirt in
conjunction with the portions of the recovered collection to reconstruct the deposits in the cave. These
materials, while not recovered in situ, still have much to offer our research because we can now connect
them to this site.
The historical outline presented here is by no means complete, but as we continue research into
the cave, this document will be updated. Reconstructing the chronology of historical events in the cave,
while complex, should continue because it has proven to be a fruitful endeavor. In doing so I have
relocated orphaned collections and reconnected the site with individuals and artifacts long forgotten.
Spirit Eye is going to make significant contributions to our understanding of prehistoric life in the
Chihuahuan Desert and is worth the effort.
