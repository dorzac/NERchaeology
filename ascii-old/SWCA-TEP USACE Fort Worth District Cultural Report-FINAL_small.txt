ABSTRACT
On behalf of Texas Express Pipeline LLC, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological survey of portions of the proposed Texas Express Pipeline
(TEP) project from Skellytown to Mont Belvieu. The work included an archaeological
background literature and records review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing
and deep testing. All work was conducted in support of Texas Express Pipeline LLC’s
application requirements for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit (File
# SWF-2011-0525) in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of
Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with
current Interim Guidance Document dated April 25, 2005) and Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 USC 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR
800).
The proposed project falls under the jurisdiction of three different USACE Districts. The part of
the proposed pipeline under the jurisdiction of the Tulsa District is 218.5 miles and extends
from the project start in Carson County to Archer County in north Texas. The portion of the
project under the jurisdiction of the Fort Worth District is 286.5 miles and extends from Archer
to Grimes counties in the central part of the State. The portion of the project under the
jurisdiction of the Galveston District covers 79.6 miles, from Montgomery County to the end of
the line in Chambers County. This document reports only on the section of the TEP project route
under the jurisdiction of the USACE Fort Worth District. The portion of the TEP project route
under the jurisdiction of the USACE Tulsa and Galveston District will be presented in separate
reports.
Following an agency-approved scope of work, the survey did not include the entire 580-milelong project route. Rather, the field survey utilized a “first terrace to first terrace” survey
methodology wherein only the terraces and floodplains adjacent to natural, relatively intact
USACE jurisdictional waterways were examined. The SWCA archaeological investigations
consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing within a 300-foot-wide survey
corridor. Deep testing was conducted along portions of the project route with deep alluvial
sediments which exhibited a potential to contain buried cultural resources. All investigations
followed standards and guidelines of the NHPA and the Texas Historical Commission’s
minimum archaeological survey standards for such projects.
The survey defined 33 newly identified archaeological sites and investigated portions of two
previously identified archaeological sites. Sites include: 21 prehistoric sites; 2 sites with mixed
historic and prehistoric cultural components; and 12 historic Euroamerican sites (including 3
cemeteries).
AVOIDANCE is recommended for all or portions of 5 sites: Site 41JA47 (Dry Stone Wall at
Fort Robinson), 41JN69, 41PR157 (Canafax-Brawley Cemetery), 41ML302 (Peteete Cemetery),
and 41GM425 (Punchard-Alexander Cemetery).
The current investigation also surveyed a portion of 41HI326, the J.T. Baker Farmstead-Site,
which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1992 under Criteria C
and D in the areas of Architecture and Archeology with a period of significance from 1881-1941
(#92000138). As proposed, the project will have NO ADVERSE EFFECT on any contributing

archaeological deposits or standing structures associated with J.T. Baker Farmstead within the
current alignment of the survey corridor.
The remaining 29 archaeological sites within the investigated corridor are recommended NOT
ELIGIBLE for listing on the National Register of Historic Places within the current alignment of
the construction corridor. Based on the current project configuration, 20 of these 29 will be
affected by the project and nine will be avoided.
In accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C and Section 106 of the NHPA (36 CFR 800.4),
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the
anticipated permit review area. Based on the results of the current effort, it is SWCA’s opinion
that the proposed project will have NO ADVERSE EFFECT on significant cultural resources
within the investigated project area. As such, SWCA recommends no further archaeological
investigations for the currently defined project area and that the project be allowed to proceed.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Intensive Archaeological Survey of Portions of the Proposed Texas Express
Pipeline Project, Skellytown to Mont Belvieu, Texas, within the USACE Fort Worth District.
SWCA PROJECT NUMBER: 22254
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Texas Express Pipeline LLC, is proposing to construct a pipeline
starting at Skellytown in the Texas Panhandle and crossing approximately 580 miles to Mont
Belvieu in Southeast Texas. The part of the pipeline under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District is approximately 286.5 miles in total length
and will be constructed within a workspace ranging between 80 to 90 feet in width, with
additional. Most of the proposed pipeline corridor is co-located within previously surveyed
corridors. The SWCA investigations included a background literature and records review and an
intensive archaeological survey within a 300-foot-wide survey corridor for portions of the project
alignment crossing anticipated USACE jurisdictional waterways.
LOCATION: The portion of the Texas Express Pipeline project under the jurisdiction of the
USACE Fort Worth District starts in southeastern Archer County, approximately 2.25 miles
northwest of the intersection of Calvin Road and Andrews Road. The alignment continues in a
southeasterly direction, crossing south of Fort Worth and Dallas, and ends at the
Grimes/Montgomery county line, approximately 0.67 miles southeast of the intersection of
Farm-to-Market (FM) 1486 and County Road (CR) 243, for a total distance of 286.5 miles.
NUMBER OF ACRES SURVEYED: Approximately 4,382 acres (investigations were conducted
within a 300-foot-wide survey corridor along portions of the line totaling approximately 120.5
miles).
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Michael S. Crow.
DATES OF WORK: From December 2011 to August 2012.
PURPOSE OF WORK: On behalf of Texas Express Pipeline LLC, SWCA completed an
archaeological survey pursuant to regulatory obligations related to the acquisition of a USACE
Section 404 Permit in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of
Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with
current Interim Guidance Documented April 25, 2005) and the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA).
NUMBER OF SITES: Thirty-three newly identified archaeological sites and two previously
recorded archaeological sites (portions of which were investigated).
ELIGIBILITY OF SITES: Sites include: 21 prehistoric sites; 2 sites with mixed historic and
prehistoric cultural components; and 12 historic Euroamerican sites (including 3 cemeteries).
AVOIDANCE is recommended for the 3 cemetery sites: 41PR157 (Canafax-Brawley Cemetery),
41ML302 (Peteete Cemetery), and 41GM425 (Punchard-Alexander Cemetery). Cemeteries are

xi

protected by Texas State Law (Chapters 694-715 of the Health and Safety Code) and Texas
Administrative Code (Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 22).
AVOIDANCE is also recommended for Site 41JA47 (Dry Stone Wall at Fort Robinson). Site
41JA47 is potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP. The current project corridor has been
modified to avoid any intact remains of the resource and will have will have NO ADVERSE
EFFECT. AVOIDANCE is also recommended for that portion of Site 41JN69 located outside of
the proposed construction corridor.
The current investigation also surveyed a portion of 41HI326, the J.T. Baker Farmstead-Site.
The J.T. Baker Farmstead was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1992
under Criteria C and D in the areas of Architecture and Archeology with a period of significance
from 1881-1941 (#92000138). The current project corridor encroaches on only a small portion
of the pasture within the property. Only ephemeral artifacts were identified during
archaeological testing of the project corridor. No standing structures will be impacted by the
current alignment. There will be NO ADVERSE EFFECT to potential archaeological deposits
or standing structures associated with J.T. Baker Farmstead within the current alignment of the
survey corridor.
The remaining 29 archaeological sites within the current alignment of the investigated
construction corridor are recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places.
CURATION: SWCA primarily conducted a non-collection survey. Most artifacts were tabulated,
analyzed, and documented in the field, but not collected. Only diagnostic and rare and unusual
artifacts were collected. The collected artifacts are temporarily housed at the SWCA Houston
office. At the completion of all field efforts, analysis, and reporting, artifacts will either be
returned to the landowner from whose property the materials were collected or curated at the
Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory in Austin.
COMMENTS: The archaeological investigations were concentrated along portions of the project
route crossing anticipated USACE jurisdictional waterways. Crossings were investigated
utilizing a “first-terrace-to-first-terrace” survey methodology, wherein the terraces and
floodplains adjacent to each drainage were examined. All investigations were in accordance
with the standards and guidelines of the NHPA and the Texas Historical Commissions minimum
archaeological survey standards for such projects.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Texas Express Pipeline LLC,
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological
survey for portions of the proposed 580-mile
Texas Express Pipeline, Skellytown to Mont
Belvieu Project. This work was conducted
as part of the project sponsor’s compliance
with application requirements for a U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section
404 permit in accordance with 33 CFR Part
325, Appendix C and the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA).

Archaeologists Vince Valenti, Allison King,
Christian T. Hartnett, and Jill Armbruster
served as Field Directors. The field work
was conducted by Crew Chiefs Iasha
Duomano, Dan Rodriguez, Alamea Young,
and Lance Hays and Archaeological
Technicians Brian Huttick, Matt Masham,
Sarah Wittenauer, Kenny Rosemary, Dan
Aylward, Rosemarie Pavel, Dilpreet Singh,
Jesse Novak, Travis Cornish, Wes Mattox,
Joseph O’Keefe, Walker Van Item, Sphia
Salgado, David Sandrock, Matthew Carter,
Ty Swavely, Christopher Stephenson,
Christopher Barry, Ahsley Eyeington, Molly
Palmisen, Tessa Noble, Preston Beecher,
James Barrera, and Kevin Hanselka. Data
entry was conducted by Travis Cornish,
Sarah Wittenauer, Alamea Young, Matthew
Carter, and Walker Van Item. The text was
edited by Susan Butler. Graphics were
prepared by Brent Cochran, Grace Cynkar,
Allison King, and Colleen Kennedy.

The archaeological investigations began
with a background literature and records
review of previously conducted cultural
resources investigations and recorded
archaeological
sites.
The
fieldwork
consisted of an intensive linear pedestrian
survey with subsurface investigations of
stream and river floodplains and adjacent
terraces. The goal of the work was to locate
all prehistoric and historic archaeological
sites in the investigated project area,
establish vertical and horizontal site
boundaries as appropriate, and evaluate the
significance and eligibility of any site
recorded for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Texas Express Pipeline (TEP) project is
a new 20-inch diameter natural gas liquids
(NGL) pipeline that will originate from
Skellytown in Carson County, Texas and
extend in a southeasterly direction across 27
counties to NGL fractionation and storage
facilities in Mont Belvieu, Chambers
County, Texas (Figure 1). The pipeline is
being constructed by Enterprise Products
Partner L.P. (Enterprise), Enbridge Energy
Partners, L.P., and Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation. Enterprise will operate the
pipeline upon completion.

All investigations were conducted in
accordance
with
Texas
Historical
Commission (THC) standards. Michael
Crow served as Principal Investigator and
participated in portions of the fieldwork.
The report was prepared by Archaeologists
Todd L. Butler, Marianne Marek and
Christian T. Hartnett.
Architectural
Historian Anna Mod conducted various
portions of the background research and
prepared portions of the text in association
with Site 41JA47 (Dry Stone Wall at Fort
Robinson), the J.T. Baker Farmstead
(41HI326),
and
Site
41GM5.

The proposed pipeline is approximately 580
miles long. Construction impacts will be
restricted to an estimated 80 to 90-foot-wide
easement or workspace in addition to any
temporary workspaces needed within the

300-foot-wide survey corridor. There will
also be a number of ancillary facilities and
access roads. Construction impacts will
include clearing of vegetation, grading, and
stockpiling of soil. With the exception of
horizontal directional drills (HDD) and
bores at roads, rivers, and some other
locations, the pipeline will be installed using
the conventional open-cut construction
method. The proposed project mainly
crosses privately-owned lands, following
existing pipeline and utility easements along
most of its route. It is estimated that as
much as 80 percent of the current alignment
is collocated with existing pipeline and
utility easements.

County. The portion of the project under the
jurisdiction of the Fort Worth District is
286.5 miles, starting in southeast Archer
County and ending at the southern edge of
Grimes County. The jurisdiction of the
Galveston District covers 79.6 miles,
starting in Montgomery County and ending
at the terminus of the line in Chambers
County (Figure 1).

The proposed TEP project spans the state of
Texas from the Panhandle to Southeast
Texas. The portion of the TEP project under
the jurisdiction of the USACE Fort Worth
District includes the portion of the route
through Archer, Young, Jack, Wise, Parker,
Tarrant, Johnson, Hill, McLennan, Falls,
Robertson, Brazos, and Grimes counties.

GEOLOGY
The proposed TEP corridor spans a majority
of the geologic history of Texas. The part of
the TEP route under the jurisdiction of the
USACE Fort Worth District spans
geographically from the Pennsylvanian
Formations in Archer and Jack Counties to
the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation of
southeast Texas. A summary of the
geological units crossed by the TEP project
is presented in Table 2. A full description of
the geological formations is provided in
Appendix A1.

PHYSIOGRAPHIC REGIONS
The project area is situated along the Black
and Grand Prairies and Cross Timbers
physiographic areas (Spearing 1998;
Swanson 2001). These areas include the
Cross Timber, Grand Prairie, and Blackland
prairie vegetation areas, which contain post

Holocene or Quaternary Alluvium refers to
floodplain and channel deposits. It consists of
silt, sand, clay, and gravel, and often contains a
good deal of organic matter making for fertile
soils. Alluvium is normally deposited by rivers,
forming floodplains or deltas, but may be
deposited at any point where the river overflows
its banks or where the velocity of a river is
checked – for example, where it runs into a lake.
Alluvium includes lowest terrace deposits near
floodplain level, minor colluvium deposited on
valley slopes peripheral to floodplain, locally
developed eolian dunes of sand and silt, and
bedrock locally in stream channels. Table 3
provides the locations of Holocene alluvium
along the USACE Fort Worth District section of
the TEP corridor.

Soils across the portion of the proposed corridor
within the USACE Fort Worth District vary
greatly, as the project spans multiple
physiographic zones from northwest to
southeast. Through southeastern Archer and
northwestern Jack Counties, the Bonti and
Exray soils are formed over sandstone or
interbedded sandstone and clayey red beds, and
are generally well drained with stone inclusions.
Further southeast through Jack County, soils
transition from shallow to very shallow loamy
and stony Palopinto series soils that formed in
limestone. These soils are well drained and
formed on mostly gently sloping upland and
terrace savannahs.
In extreme southwestern Wise and north central
Parker Counties, the dominant Windthorst series
consists of very deep, moderately well drained,
moderately slowly permeable soils that formed
in loamy and clayey materials stratified with
packsand. These soils are on very gently to
strongly sloping uplands. Southward through
eastern Parker County, the Aledo series consists
of shallow to very shallow, well drained,
moderately permeable soils that formed in
interbedded limestones and marls of Cretaceous
age. These soils are on gently sloping to steep
uplands.

In southeastern Parker County, the proposed
corridor crosses the Trinity River and Bear
Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River. Soils
within the floodplains surrounding the two
waterways are in the Frio series, which consists
of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly
permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey
calcareous alluvium.

SOILS
Soil survey data was obtained from the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS 2012)
for Texas counties. The current project area
crosses 13 counties and numerous individual
soil units and associations. In the interest of
brevity, summaries of the major soil trends of
the project area from northwest to southeast are
presented below. A complete description of the
soils is provided in Appendix A2-A3.

Into the uplands of western Johnson County,
soils vary between the aforementioned Aledo
series and the Sanger series, which consist of
very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable
clay that formed in clayey marine sediments.
These soils are found on gently sloping to

mammals, 57 species of reptiles, and 23 species

strongly sloping broad uplands. As the
alignment crosses through western Hill County
and into northeastern McLennan County, soils
vary between deep, clayey soils on nearly level
floodplains near waterways to well drained,
deep sandy loams on top of weathered shale on
nearly level to strongly sloping uplands.

A variety of wildlife exists along the project
area, as it lies along the boundary of two floral
regions, the cross timbers and prairies and the
post-oak savannah. Blair (1950) defines the
following mammals as common within the
Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer
(Odocileus virginianus), muskrat (Ondatra
zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote
(Canis
latrans),
opossum
(Didelphis
virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus),
eastern pipistrellus bat (Pipestrellus subflavus),
red bat (Lasiurus carolinensis), fox squirrel
(Sciurus niger), gray squirrel (Sciurus
carolinensis),
southern
flying
squirrel
(Glaucomys
volans),
gopher
(Geomys
breviceps),
fulvous
harvest
mouse
(Reithrodonomys fulvescens), white-footed
mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), marsh rice rat
(Oryzomys palustris), cotton rat (Sigmodon
hispidus), packrat (Neotoma floridana), eastern
cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp
rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus). Historically, red
wolf, bison and black bear ranged into or near
the project area (Burt and Grossenheider 1976;
Kricher and Morrison 1998; Sutton and Sutton
1985).

Into southern McLennan County, soils are
primarily within the Wilson series, which
consists of very deep, moderately well drained,
very slowly permeable soils that formed in
alkaline clayey sediments. These soils are on
nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces or
terrace remnants on uplands. In far northern
Falls County, the corridor crosses a swath of the
Houston Black soil series. The Houston Black
series consists of very deep, moderately well
drained, very slowly permeable soils that
formed from weakly consolidated calcareous
clays and marls of Cretaceous Age. These soils
are on nearly level to moderately sloping
uplands. Soils through Falls County are
generally silty and sandy loam formed in
alkaline clayey and shale sediments. Southward
into Robertson and Brazos Counties, upland
soils transition to deep, well drained sands and
loams formed in loamy beds, while soils
surrounding drainages are more clayey.
Deep, well drained sands and loams continue
through Grimes County, with the exception of
the far eastern side of the county, where soils
transition to Frelsberg, Kaufman, Gladewater
and Tinn series floodplain clays. These soils are
on nearly level ground, and formed in clayey
alluvium.

Bison constituted one of the major game
resources throughout prehistory. However, this
resource was intermittently absent from the
region (Dillehay 1974). Possibly more than any
other resource, with exception of cultigens in
later prehistory, bison played a profound role in
prehistoric society, including technological
organization, mobility, population size, and
political organization.

FLORA AND FAUNA
The project area is located in the northern Texan
biotic province, which extends from central
Texas to east-central Oklahoma (Blair 1950).
The Texan biotic province is a transitional zone
from the mesic forests of eastern North America
to the xeric grasslands of the central United
States. The province has a high faunal diversity.

Common land turtles include the eastern box
turtle (Terrapene Carolina) and western box
turtle (Terrapene ornate), while the snapping
turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna), and diamondback

terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards include
the green anole (Anolis carloinensis), eastern
fence
lizard
(Sceloporus
undulates),
broad-headed skink (Eumeces laticeps),
six-lined
racerunner
(Chemidophorus
sexlineatus), and eastern grass lizard
(Ophiosaurus ventralis). Snakes, amphibians,
and birds are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity (Blair 1950).
The reptilian assemblage includes the racer
(Coluber constrictor), rat snake (Elaphe
obsoleta),
timber
rattlesnake
(Crotalus
horridus), common kingsnake (Lampropeltis
getulus), woodhouse toad (Bufo woodhousii),
bullfrog (Rana catesbiana), northern leopard
frog (Rana pipiens), eastern box turtle
(Terrapene carolina), and the gulf coast toad
(Bufo vallicepus) (Blair 1950; Brown 1985;
Conant and Collins 1998; Sutton and Sutton
1985).
Breeding birds common to the wooded areas
include black vulture (Coragyps atratus) and
turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), wild turkey
(Meleagris gallopavo), northern bobwhite quail
(Colinus virginianus), mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura),
red-bellied
woodpecker
(Melanerpes carolinus), downy woodpecker
(Picoides pubescens), scissor-tailed flycatcher
(Tyrannus forficatus), blue jay (Cyanocitta

and lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus).
Migratory species within wooded areas include
yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius),
northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), eastern
phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), ruby-crowned
kinglet (Regulus calendula), hermit thrush
(Catharus guttatus), American robin (Turdus

CHAPTER 3. CULTURAL BACKGROUND
10,000 to 6500 B.C. Presumably, this use was by
hunter-gatherer groups with low population
densities and high residential mobility. An
analysis of materials collected by C. K.
Chandler and other avocational archaeologists
from sites chiefly in Ellis County during the
Superconducting Super Collider project
identified a handful of Paleoindian projectile
points typed as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Golondrina, and San Patrice, along with several
untyped lanceolate specimens (Yedlowski et al.
1998:519–520). Other early materials from the
area include one Folsom point from the Wild
Bull site in Henderson County (Story 1965:189–
190); a few San Patrice points from RichlandChambers Reservoir (McGregor and Bruseth
1987:176–179); several Brazos Fishtail and
Plainview points from Aquilla Lake (Brown
1987:44-1–44-2); a cache of 23 prismatic blades
from a site in Navarro County; probably the
Brookeen Creek cache of 173 blades and flakes
from Hill County (Mallouf 1981); and one
Folsom point from Lake Limestone (Mallouf
1979:44).

Texas is a large state with many diverse
environments and a plethora of natural resources
that have been exploited throughout a long span
of human occupation. This has created a vast
array of archaeological sites as humans have
adapted to the various biotic communities across
the state. The archaeology of Texas has been
divided into a series of regions that roughly
correspond with the various geographical and
environmental regions of the state. The portion
of the TEP route is in the North Central Texas
archaeological region as defined by Perttula
(2004).

PREHISTORIC CULTURAL SETTING
The archaeology of this area, or at least its core
part, is not well understood because few largescale projects involving excavations at
numerous sites have been undertaken. Among
those project areas that have contributed
important information are the Superconducting
Super Collider in Ellis County, Bardwell Lake
in Ellis County, Cedar Creek Reservoir in
Kaufman and Henderson Counties, RichlandChambers Reservoir in Navarro and Freestone
Counties, and Navarro Mills Reservoir in
Navarro and Hill Counties (see Guy [1990],
Prikryl [1990], and Yedlowski et al. [1998] for
more-detailed information on these and other
regionally relevant projects). However, Cedar
Creek Reservoir and Richland-Chambers
Reservoir are on the eastern margin of the area
and tell us more about Native American
adaptations to the Oak Woodlands than the
Blackland Prairie.

ARCHAIC
Mixing of components also has hampered
interpretations about how the region was used
by Native Americans during the lengthy Archaic
period, ca. 6500 B.C. to A.D. 700. Because few
pure Archaic components have been excavated,
particularly ones dating to the first two-thirds of
the period, it is difficult to say much about
artifact chronologies, subsistence practices, or
settlement strategies. A variety of projectile
point styles traditionally associated with the
early and middle parts of the Archaic period in
central Texas for example, Andice, Angostura,
Bell, Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Nolan, Travis,
and Uvalde (Yedlowski et al. 1998:520) were
identified
during
analyses
for
the
Superconducting Super Collider project (while a
host of other types perhaps dating to this time

PALEOINDIAN
There are no excavated and reported
Paleoindian components on the central
Blackland Prairie itself. Nonetheless, a variety
of early points have been found, largely in
surface contexts, and it is clear that this part of
Texas was used throughout the period from ca.
8

and later were identified as well, their
chronologies are less certain), but these points
are few in number and do not appear to
represent major occupation of this part of the
Blackland Prairie. Demonstrably early points
were even scarcer at the nearby Pecan Springs
site at Bardwell Reservoir and the Strawn Creek
site at Navarro Mills Reservoir, with a Hoxie
point from Pecan Springs being the clearest
example (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al. 1966).
Similarly, early to middle Archaic points,
including Angostura, Bell/Andice, Gower,
Hoxie (?), and Martindale, were found only in
small numbers at Aquilla Lake to the west
(Brown 1987:44-12–44-21), suggesting limited
use of the valleys of Aquilla and Hackberry
Creeks during this time.

B .P .

All parts of the central Blackland Prairie
that have been studied archaeologically contain
sites dating to this period, and the late Archaic
represents the earliest time for which much is
known about Native American lifeways. Both
the Pecan Springs and Strawn Creek sites on the
Blackland Prairie proper yielded such late
Archaic point types as Gary, Dawson, and
Yarbrough, although they tend to be mixed with
materials from later occupations (Duffield
1963:60–62; Sorrow et al. 1966:56–61). The
surface collections analyzed during the
Superconducting Super Collider project also
contained these types, as well as a number of
late Archaic types common in central Texas
including Bulverde, Darl, Ensor, Marcos,
Marshall, Montell, and Pedernales and a variety
of probably late Archaic forms more
characteristic of the north-central and eastern
parts of the state, such as Carrollton, Edgewood,
Elam, Ellis, Kent, and Neches River (Yedlowski
et al. 1998:520–521). Noting the relatively high
frequency of late Archaic projectile points,
Yedlowski et al. (1998:527–528, 533) suggest
that the region saw an increase in utilization by
hunter-gatherers as a result of moister climatic
conditions than before, presumably associated
with greater productivity in subsistence
resources. They also note that, while the
projectile point evidence indicates interaction
with groups living in central Texas proper,
larger proportions of points indicate affinities
with eastern Texas than during the early and
middle Archaic.

The relatively intensive work at RichlandChambers Reservoir and Lake Limestone (and
Jewett Mine just to the east) suggests a similar
conclusion for the western edge of the Oak
Woodlands, although for both areas it has been
noted that data pertaining to the early to middle
Archaic may be scarce in part because sites
dating to this interval lie deeply buried or were
removed by extensive erosion during the midHolocene (Fields 1995:302; McGregor and
Bruseth 1987:229). Only a few radiocarbon
assays predating 4000 B.P. were obtained from
these project areas, and only one excavated site,
Charles Cox at the Jewett Mine, contains a
substantial component that might be early or
middle Archaic in age (Fields 1995:303, 304–
305). This component appears to be represented
by a variety of untyped dart points with
expanding and parallel stems, but later materials
are mixed in as well, and the deposits were not
dated by radiocarbon. Points dated to this
interval in central Texas, for example,
Bell/Andice/Calf Creek and Hoxie, occur at
both Richland-Chambers Reservoir and the
Jewett Mine, but only in very small numbers.

Brown (1987:44-22–44-26) presents similar
conclusions concerning an increase in
occupational intensity (increased population?)
and increased interaction to the north and east
during the late Archaic for the Aquilla Lake area
based on an increase in the number of sites with
late Archaic diagnostics and the dominance of
the Gary dart point type. The same certainly
may be said for those project areas at the eastern
edge of the region, i.e., Cedar Creek Reservoir
and Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Two of the

A much different picture is presented for the late
part of the Archaic period, i.e., after about 4000

clearly used the area in an intensive fashion for
residential purposes, and it appears that
populations increased while territory sizes
decreased. A conspicuous component of the
record is the so-called Wylie pit, examples of
which were excavated at the Bird Point Island
and Adams Ranch sites. These were large
features that appear to have been used for
communal processing of vegetal resources (and
later as cemeteries), perhaps in the context of
band aggregation in “tension zones” as
territories decreased in size (McGregor and
Bruseth 1987:237).

three excavated sites at Cedar Creek Reservoir
have strong late Archaic components
represented by numerous Gary points and a
variety of other lithic tools (Story 1965), while
at least 15 sites at Richland-Chambers Reservoir
have identifiable components of this age. In
addition to constellations of projectile point
styles (e.g., Dawson, Gary, Godley, Kent,
Neches River oletha, and Yarbrough) that
indicate ties more to the north and east than to
the south and west, each of these areas has
yielded information suggesting that ceramics
may have been introduced into the material
culture of local groups during the latest part of
the late Archaic, as they were across most of
Texas to the east (where this interval usually is
called the Early Ceramic period, and sometimes
the Woodland period).

LATE PREHISTORIC
Sites dating to the Late Prehistoric period, after
ca. A.D. 700, also are common across the central
Blackland Prairie. The collections studied
during the Superconducting Super Collider
project contain substantial numbers of both
early (e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Colbert,
Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and
Perdiz) arrow points, but Yedlowski et al.
(1998:521, 527) note that early arrow points are
more frequent, perhaps reflecting continued
high population densities from the late Archaic
period. Other than the Perdiz and Scallorn types,
which have such widespread distributions, the
arrow point styles point eastward and
northward. The limited ceramic samples,
containing sherds reminiscent of types such as
Weches Fingernail Impressed, Killough
Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poyner
Engraved, also support interaction with
Caddoan groups to the east (Yedlowski et al.
1998:521–522). The Strawn Creek site at
Navarro Mills Reservoir presents a similar
picture, with most of the typed arrow points
dating to the first half of the Late Prehistoric
period and the more-distinctive ceramics in the
small collection relating to the early Caddoan
types Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Weches
Fingernail Impressed (Duffield 1963). The
Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir also
yielded numerous early arrow points, as well as
a respectable number of Perdiz points, along

At Cedar Creek Reservoir, there are hints in the
distributional data from the Lacy and Gossett
Bottoms sites that the initial use of ceramic
containers preceded introduction of the bow and
arrow, although it is difficult to be certain
because the sites were not well stratified and the
sherds could not be related to known early types
such as Williams Plain (Story 1965:248, 251).
At Richland-Chambers Reservoir, distinctive
shell-tempered sherds were recovered from
contexts dated between A.D. 200 and 700 at the
Adams Ranch site (McGregor and Bruseth
1987:180–181), apparently representing the
earliest ceramic industry in this part of the
Trinity River basin.
The most-complete picture of the archaeology
of the late Archaic for this region comes from
the Oak Woodlands at the eastern margin of the
Blackland Prairie. Along Richland and
Chambers Creeks, late Archaic groups appear to
have been hunter-gatherers whose subsistence
pursuits focused on wild plant foods, such as

such as deer, turtles, small mammals, birds, and
fish (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:236–240).
While presumably not sedentary, these groups

with a small collection of highly fragmented
sherds (Sorrow et al. 1966).
As for the preceding late Archaic period, some
of the best data concerning how Native
Americans used the region during the Late
Prehistoric period is from Richland-Chambers
Reservoir. Sites dating to this interval are
common at Richland-Chambers Reservoir,
especially for the early half of the period, and it
appears that there was a significant decline in
population densities after about A.D. 1300
(McGregor and Bruseth 1987:245). The data
suggest that most of the excavated sites with
Late Prehistoric components were used for
residential purposes (McGregor and Bruseth
1987:241, 244, 246), although there are some
sites, for example the stream-side concentrations
of mussel shells and artifacts at 41FT193 and
41NV139, that probably were used in a more
limited fashion. The house patterns at the Bird
Point Island site point to intensive use by
sedentary hunter-gatherers during the first half
of the period, while other components that are
contemporaneous, slightly earlier, or later (e.g.,
at Bird Point Island, Adams Ranch, Irvine, and
Little Cedar Creek) have middens and numerous
features suggesting intensive use but no houses.
These components may represent occupations
that were seasonal in length. Macrobotanical
remains point to use primarily of wild plant
foods, i.e., hardwood nuts, a variety of seeds,
and tubers/ rhizomes (McGregor and Bruseth
1987:243). The only tropical cultigen is maize,
and it occurs in very small quantities only in
contexts dating to the last half of the period.
Hence, groups who lived in this area were
predominantly hunters and gatherers. The arrow
points that characterize the early and late parts
of the period (Alba, Scallorn, and Steiner vs.
Perdiz and Cliffton) are the same styles as found
elsewhere across the area, and it appears that
Gary dart points may have continued to be used
through the early Late Prehistoric (McGregor
and Bruseth 1987:183). Ceramics are
moderately common and clearly relate to

Native American archaeological sites dating to
the protohistoric and early historic periods are
not common in the central Blackland Prairie,
and it appears that much of the area was
depopulated for most of this time. Materials of
this age are so scarce as to be almost invisible
archaeologically in the project areas discussed
above, i.e., the Superconducting Super Collider,
Bardwell Lake, Cedar Creek Reservoir,
Richland-Chambers Reservoir, and Navarro
Mills Reservoir. About the only evidence for
use of these areas are occasional occurrences of
Caddoan Patton Engraved sherds, potentially late
shell-tempered sherds that could relate to
intrusive groups from Oklahoma and north
Texas, and triangular arrow points.

HISTORIC PERIOD
EARLIEST CONTACT / COLONIAL ERA (15001836)
The Spanish Colonial period (A.D. 1630–1821)
can be characterized as the initial period of
Aboriginal/European contact and European
settlement in Texas. During this time, the region
was inhabited by several aboriginal groups
including the Coapite, Copane, Karankawa, and
Orcoquizas (Kleiner 2012).
The first Spanish expedition into the area was
probably the expedition of Álvar Núñez Cabeza
de Vaca, following the failed 1527 Panfilo de
Narvaez expedition (Kleiner 2012). In February
1685, the La Salle expedition entered
Matagorda Bay and established Fort St. Louis
along Garcitas Creek. French fur traders were
operating along the northwest Gulf coast as
early as 1720 and by mid-century a trading post
was established at the mouth of the Trinity
River for the deerskin trade. Throughout the

mirroring Sam Houston’s movements and battle
plans. This large scale evacuation and panic
was known as the Runaway Scrape and affected
areas in Grimes, Brazos, Robertson, Falls,
McLennan, Hill, and Johnson counties. Many
of these fleeing settlers had arrived only a few
years before through the land grant efforts of
Stephen F. Austin and Sterling C. Robertson.
The flight continued, as entire villages were
abandoned until Houston’s major military
victory over Santa Anna at San Jacinto. Other
settlers faced frontier dangers of a different sort.
The private Fort Parker was attacked in May,
1836. Nine year old Cynthia Ann and her
brother were both kidnapped while other family
members didn’t fare as well. Indian raids, such
as the Fort Parker attack, slowed after a
company of Texas Rangers was installed at Old
Franklin (Robertson County) in 1838 (Hailey
and Long 2012).

mid-1700s, the upper Texas coast continued to
be an area of contention between France and
Spain until the 1763 Treaty of Paris clearly
placed Texas within the Spanish realm. French
trader Joseph Blancpain traveled through the
lower Trinity River and Galveston Bay area in
1754. In response, the Spanish established
Nuestra Senora de la Luz Mission in 1756 near
the present day site of Wallisville. In the same
year a military presidio, Agustin de Ahumada,
was established on the east bank of the Trinity
River near the Liberty-Chambers County line.
Most Spanish settlements in the area were
abandoned by the early 1770s (Kleiner 2012).
Texas was still under Spanish control when the
United States acquired Louisiana in 1803
(Kleiner 2012). Mexico gained independence
from Spain and assumed its former territories in
1821. Anglo-American settlement began in
earnest after 1824 when Stephen F. Austin
received the first official colonization grant
from the Mexican government to bring 300
Anglo settlers into the area.

With the new Republic of Texas secured,
settlers made their way back to their abandoned
villages. Over the next few years, as the
government stabilized, a capitol and set of laws
were organized and enacted. Settlers, primarily
from the southeast United States, continued to
farm and ranch as they had in their home states.
Empresario grants continued, bringing new
settlers to north central Texas. One of these,
known as the Peters Colony, was created by
both American and English investors. Named
after its chief supporter, William S. Peters, the
land grant was located in present day Young and
Jack counties (Wade 2012).

Colonization proceeded rapidly and Harrisburg,
Velasco, Brazoria, Columbia, Washington, and
San Felipe became the principal settlements.
However,
the
Mexican
government’s
subsequent efforts to curtail American
immigration resulted in several disturbances.
These disturbances lead up to the Texas
Revolution and the final battle at San Jacinto in
which Texas won independence from Mexico.
REPUBLIC OF TEXAS / PRE-CIVIL WAR (1836–
1860)

The nascent Texas government, modeled after
that of the United States, made an arguably
natural and well-planned move by joining the
Union in 1845. Annexation officially went into
effect on January 1, 1846. Pressures leading up
to annexation by the United States were fairly
simple – Texas was under threat. By 1841,
Santa Anna was repositioned as the provisional
president of Mexico and made it clear that he
planned to take back former Mexican lands

The years directly before and after Texas
declared her independence from Mexico were
wrought with disruption and confusion. As
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna responded to the
Texan rebellion and pushed north to retake
Mexican land, Anglo-American settlers began
their retreat. As early as January of 1836,
south-central
Texas
settlements
were
abandoned. The line of retreat pulled northeast,

expedition teams to map the new state and
territory. Teams used existing roads and trails,
initially created by the Spanish and Indians, to
create the best routes throughout the rugged
terrain. Randolph B. Marcy led an early
expedition through the Young and Jack County
areas in 1852. Fort Belknap, then the northernmost outpost along the western frontier,
provided a rest stop for Marcy and his troops.
Marcy’s path was later picked up by the 185861 Butterfield Overland Mail route.
The
Butterfield route ran by stagecoach from St.
Louis to San Francisco and was the first
overland mail route to span the United States.
Ft. Belknap functioned as a coach station for the
Butterfield, as well as a providing a major
transportation hub connecting roads in the area
(Neighbours 2012).

(Nance 2012). By early 1842, Mexico moved
into South Texas and slowly gained ground in
what they referred to as “The Department of
Texas”. Led by General Adrian Woll, Mexican
troops seized San Antonio and were in central
Texas by March. Scuffles and attacks continued
into 1843 as the young republic attempted to
fend off Mexican forces. A truce was reached
by February of 1843, temporarily abating
further strife between the two countries (Nance
2012). By 1844, Texans seriously contemplated
their options for a secure future. Carefully
choosing to pursue federal annexation, the
Texas Congress called a special meeting at
Washington-on-the-Brazos. On July 4, 1845,
Texans met in Austin to create an ordinance to
accept statehood. Showing strong support, the
United States Congress approved annexation by
a vote of 4,245 to 257 in October and Texas was
signed in as a state on December 29, 1845. The
first state legislature was up and running by
early 1846 (Nance 2012).

While forts were constructed to protect
westward expansion on lands in north central
Texas, the area which would become Hill,
McLennan, Falls, Robertson, Brazos, and
Grimes counties flourished during the
antebellum/early statehood years. The City of
Waco was established in 1848 at the old Waco
Indian village site. The small town was located
on the banks of the Brazos River and quickly
became an economic marketplace for plantation
crops such as cotton and corn. With access to
plentiful rains, good soils, and riparian
environments, the early settlements of central
Texas grew steadily under the southern
plantation economic model (Smyrl 2012).

Mexico responded fiercely to annexation and
their new, increasingly west-ward expanding
neighbor to the north.
After boundary
disagreements, the United States quickly found
itself at war with Mexico and under attack on
American soil. After numerous assaults on
Mexico by land and sea, the United States
defeated Mexico by 1847. The Mexican War
was finally put to rest with the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. This act forced
Mexico to officially recognize the annexation of
Texas. The treaty also secured much of the
southwest and California for the United States.

THE POST–CIVIL WAR / RECONSTRUCTION
PERIOD (1865–1880)

Eager to explore and protect newly acquired
lands, the United States quickly set out to
survey and connect the vast area across the
southwest and California with the states and
infrastructure in the east. To accomplish this,
the government created a line of forts across
Texas to protect the frontier for newly arrived
and westward moving settlers. The army and
the United States Boundary Commission sent

The years of the Civil War were generally
damaging to the small settlements of central
Texas.
Business and commerce suffered as
men enlisted to fight in the war. An exception
to this general trend occurred in Robertson
County. In support of the confederate cause,
county residents supplied food to the army.
Further, Robertson County also raised enough

13

extant military buildings were converted for
commercial and residential uses. Suffering
through the Civil War, Fort Worth slowly
gained ground during reconstruction. During
these years, Tarrant County positioned itself to
act as a market for the cattle industry. Offering
supplies and lodging, Fort Worth became a
major stop along one alignment of the Chisholm
Trail. Railroad companies soon arrived in the
area, to provide much needed transport for cattle
and supplies. The Texas and Pacific Railway
arrived in Tarrant County in the early 1870s,
followed by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas, the
Santa Fe, the Fort Worth and New Orleans, the
St. Louis Southwestern, and the Fort Worth and
Rio Grande lines (Hightower 2012).

funds to establish a textile and flour mill to
support troops (Hailey and Long 2012).
Reconstruction proved difficult for all of the
small towns throughout central Texas. Old
military forts were occupied once more by
Union troops and towns in central and south
central Texas struggled with new social and
economic norms after the abolition of slavery.
In order to cope with such drastic economic
shifts, large plantations were either broken into
smaller farms and sold or left intact and run
through sharecropping practices.
While Reconstruction forced economic shifts
and adjustments to many planters and ranchers
in central Texas, local communities quickly
rallied. New settlers and confederate refugees
moved to the region in search of new land.
Farming and ranching dominated commerce,
with cotton, corn, and wheat as primary crops in
the 1870s and 80s.

As northwest Texas received more and more
settlers and commerce improved, new forts were
constructed along the westward expanding
frontier. Fort Richardson was built in 1868 and
quickly became the most important strategic
military station in the state (Hamilton 2012).
The unstockaded fort provided a wide array of
duties. While the main purpose was to protect
settlers in the area from Comanche and Kiowa
raids, the soldiers also assisted stage coach and
wagon trains, protected local cattle herds,
oversaw elections in the area, and acted as a
local police force, pursuing and prosecuting
local criminals (Hamilton 2012).

Railroad companies gained a hold in the local
economy after the Civil War and during
reconstruction. The first rails to reach the south
central Texas region occurred in the years
leading up to the Civil War. Progress was
halted by the start of the war, but resumed
quickly in 1866. The Houston and Texas
Central Railroad resumed construction on its
line, heading north to the new settlement of
Bryan that year (Odintz 2012). By the late
1870s, Waco’s economy began to show true
signs of recovery, likely spurred on by the
completion of the suspension bridge in 1870,
creating a reliable river crossing. The Waco and
Northwestern Railroad arrived in the city in
1872, giving McLennan County access to
markets by rail in addition to the much used
Brazos River (Smyrl 2012).

By 1885, barbed wired closed the open range,
halting the long cattle drives to the north.
During this time, small farms and ranches grew
in the area. Primary crops such as cotton, corn,
and wheat continued to dominate production.
Shifts and advances in technology, like
widespread use of the cotton gin, also helped
small land owners, encouraging population
growth throughout the region.

The cattle industry grew during the 1870s and
80s. Fort Worth was founded as a military
outpost in 1850. It was abandoned by 1853 but
settlers in the area stayed near the fort and

LATE NINETEENTH TO MID TWENTIETH
CENTURY (1890–1950S)
The final push of railroad construction occurred
in the late-ninetieth and early-twentieth

Belknap in 1936 (Leffler 2012). The Civilian
Conservation Corps, coupled with Civil Works
Administration (later the Works Progress
Administration) constructed numerous buildings

centuries, with railways finally reaching Archer
and Young counties as late as 1910. The Santa
Fe rail shops were constructed in Cleburne
(Johnson County) during this time and small
towns and villages continued to spring up along
the railways.
Road construction followed,
providing access to railway hubs. This new
transportation
network,
coupled
with
streamlined and newly mechanized production,
led to greater economic growth in the area.
While farming and ranching continued to
dominate the economic landscape, growing
cities like Waco and Fort Worth, also saw
diversification in industry production during this
time period.

United States involvement in World War II
ended the depression in central Texas.
Diversified factory work, along with oil, and
natural gas production quickly expanded during
the 1940s and 50s, while rural populations fell,
as people moved to larger towns and cities in
search economic opportunity.
Agricultural
production also diversified more during the midtwentieth century, with the addition of peanut,
fruit, vegetable, and hay production. The
poultry and hog industries grew, supplementing
and diversifying cattle ranches.

The 1910s brought about even more shifts in
economic systems in the area. The cotton
boom, which lasted from the late-nineteenth
century and into the early years of the twentieth,
began to fade by 1910. This pushed local
farmers to diversify their crops. By the 1920s,
cotton production was again on the rise. Oil
was discovered in Archer, Young, Wise, Jack,
and Tarrant Counties in the 1910s and into the
early 1920s. Several oil companies constructed
refineries and located their headquarters in
Tarrant County during this period. The oil
boom of north Texas helped support local
economies as farming profits and activities
fluctuated.

In modern times, the region’s economy
continues to center around industrial production,
oil, natural gas, ranching, and farming. Fort
Worth is an international city, with world class
museums, architecture, and commerce. Waco
continues to function as a medium-sized city
supporting an important private university. The
Bryan/College station area has grown
considerably since Texas A&M University
began expanding in the mid-1960s.

Like most communities of the United States, the
depression years were hard on the counties of
central and north central Texas. By 1933, The
Texas Relief Commission, created by Governor
Ma Ferguson, began funneling millions of
federal relief funds into the state. Central Texas
communities benefitted from the creation of the
Brazos River Conservation and Reclamation
District and the Rural Electrification
Administration projects, which brought
electricity to thousands of homes for the first
time (Leffler 2012; Davis 2012). Further New
Deal monies were used by the Works Progress
Administration to reconstruct and restore Fort

CHAPTER 4. PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND
IDENTIFIED CULTURAL RESOURCES
SWCA conducted a background review and
literature search to determine the locations
and content of any previous archaeological
surveys and recorded archaeological sites
within a half-mile radius of the proposed
TEP project route.
The investigation
utilized the THC’s Historic Sites Atlas (an
online database), and documents on file at
the
Texas
Archaeological
Research
Laboratory and the THC in Austin. Site
files, relevant maps, and NRHP and Texas
State Archaeological Landmark (SAL)
listings were examined. Historic maps and
aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic
Geology Maps, and the Natural Resources
Conservation Service’s Web Soil Survey
were also examined for historical and
environmental information related to the
project area.

41WS94 was recorded as a result of this
effort.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Large area surveys and testing projects
(3839 & 4106) were conducted by
Archaeologists from Texas A&M University
in advance of construction for the Gibbons
Creek Electric Station (Bond 1977, Ippolito
1979). Multiple additional survey, testing
and excavation projects (3709, 3710, 4323)
were undertaken for the Gibbons Creek
Lignite Mine. A very large number of
archeological sites were recorded during
these investigations (Rogers 1993, 1994).

In Robertson County, a number of
archaeological projects (6105, 6098, 5297)
were undertaken in conjunction with the
TNP One Power Plant (Kotter 1987, Kotter
and Gearhardt 1989). Approximately 15
archaeological sites recording during
investigations for this plant are located
within one mile of the proposed TEP project
corridor (41RT363, 460-462, 467, 468, 474477, 484, 487-489).
In Brazos and Grimes counties, Sorrow and
Cox (1973) conducted a survey of the
Navasota River Basin. No archaeological
sites were recorded in the vicinity of the
proposed TEP project corridor.

The SWCA background review found that a
number
of
previously
conducted
archaeological linear and area investigations
bisect the proposed TEP route. These prior
investigations were conducted for a variety
of undertakings, including pipeline and
electric utilities, roads, fiber optic lines,
transmission lines, reservoirs, subdivisions,
and municipal projects. There are
approximately 28 archaeological projects
that intersect the survey corridor (Appendix
B). In the interest of brevity only the largest
of these investigations are discussed below.

PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED RESOURCES
The background review identified 97
previously recorded cultural resources
within a half-mile radius of the TEP project
corridor or near access roads on the portion
of the route under the jurisdiction of the
USACE Fort Worth District. These
include 22 prehistoric archaeological sites,
18 historic sites (including two National
Register
Districts
and

Archaeological Landmark), five multicomponent (historic and prehistoric) sites
and two archaeological sites for which no
information is available. Also included are
22 historic cemeteries, 14 Texas Historical
Markers (including two Registered Texas
Historic Landmarks), and 16 historic
railroads (Appendix C).
Of these, there are 15 previously recorded
resources located within or adjacent to the
300-foot-wide TEP project survey corridor
(Appendix C). Resources possibly located
within the proposed TEP project corridor
include 41WS94, 41JN60, the J.T. Baker
Farmstead
NR District,
41GM63,
41GM382, 41GM383 and 41GM5.

The portion of J.T. Baker Farmstead located
within the 300-foot-wide survey corridor
was examined during the current
investigations. Results are provided in the
next chapter.
Site 41GM5 was originally recorded in
December of 1980 by Dr. H.J. Shafer during
the Barnum Place Survey. The site was
identified as the remains of a historic early
nineteenth-century plantation from the
Texas Colonial period.

Site 41WS94 was recorded during a
transmission line project in 2009. The site is
described as a unknown prehistoric campsite
(Latham 2010). Cultural materials were
recovered from 90cm and 2 meters below
the ground surface. The recovered artifacts
included one fragment of burned ochre,
three thermally altered metate fragments,
and 22 lithic flakes. One cluster of burned
rock was interpreted as a possible hearth
feature. The site was determined to have
good integrity and monitoring during
construction was recommended (Latham
2010).

At the time it was recorded, the site
consisted of a well-preserved historic house
that was being restored by the landowner,
who was a descendant of the original
builder.
Structures present at the site
included the house and the remains of a
syrup mill. Former structures at the site
supposedly included a community school
house and slave quarters.

Site 41JN60 was recorded during a cultural
resources survey for six miles of new
electrical transmission line in northwestern
Johnson County. Research determined site
41JN60 to be a historic dump dating to the
early through mid 1950’s, and it was
recommended
NOT
ELIGIBLE
for
inclusion on the NRHP (Miller et al. 2008).
No evidence of this site was identified in
during the current survey.

The house had four chimneys and a central
breezeway. Two of the four chimneys were
still intact but needed repairs. It was
estimated the plantation had originally
covered approximately 10 acres. Subsurface
investigations recovered little cultural
materials.
The portion of 41GM5 located within the
300-foot-wide
survey
corridor
was
examined during the current investigations.
Results are provided in the next chapter.

The J.T. Baker Farmstead National
Register District is a well-preserved

17

features that will be intersected by the
proposed TEP within the Fort Worth
District. These include Fort Richardson,
several military routes, mail routes, roads,
trails, and numerous railroad alignments.

Site 41GM63 is a historic “dog trot” cabin
of “board and batten” construction with a
gabeled roof, shed porch and double
opposing chimneys (Bond 1977). The cabin
is part of the historic 1850’s Kellum Springs
resort (41GM78). The cabin was originally
recorded in 1976 during a survey for the
TMPA lignite mine. The cabin was in poor
condition when it was recorded, but was
listed as a State Archaeological Landmark in
2011. No artifacts associated with this site
were identified during the current
investigation and no further work is
recommended within the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor.

Fort Richardson
Fort Richardson is located approximately
one mile south of Jacksboro in Jack County.
It was constructed in 1868 as the northernmost outpost along the expanding frontier.
Built as a defensive fort to protect settlers
and emigrants from Comanche and Kiowa
attacks, the military complex also protected
local cattle herds and acted as a local civil
law enforcer.

Site 41GM382 is a high density prehistoric
open campsite recorded during cultural
resource investigations for the Gibbons
Creek Lignite Mine (Rogers 1994). A total
of 25 pieces of lithic debitage were
recovered from 10 to 90 cmbs in four shovel
tests. The THC determined that the site
required further testing to determine SAL
and NRHP eligibility. No artifacts were
located in the vicinity of the site during the
current investigation and no further work is
recommended within the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor.

By 1872, Fort Richardson had the largest
garrison in the United States, based partly on
its strategic placement near Indian Territory.
The garrison was involved in numerous
Indian battles and skirmishes before
securing the Texas plains. The fort was
abandoned in 1878 after the final defeat of
the Comanche and Kiowa.
The historic
complex was listed as a national historic
landmark in 1963 and became a state park in
1973 after several years of renovations
(Hamilton 2012).

Site 41GM383 is a high density
accumulation of prehistoric lithics, burned
rock and ceramics extending to one meter
below surface (Rogers 1994). The THC
determined that the site possesses research
value and is a strong candidate for SAL and
NRHP eligibility. No artifacts were located
in the vicinity of the site during the current
investigation and no further work is
recommended within the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor.

The TEP corridor runs approximately one
mile south of the main Fort Richardson
building cluster. The corridor also cuts
through pasture land south of the drystacked stone fence that may be associated
with the fort.
Nineteenth Century Military Roads
By the mid-nineteenth century, United
States military roads cut across the central
Texas frontier. This was due in part to the
annexation of Texas in 1846 and the Treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. These roads
were surveyed by US Army and US
Boundary Survey expeditions. The roads

HISTORIC FEATURES
In addition to the previously recorded
archaeological sites and historic districts
described above, there are additional historic

route approximately every 30 miles,
allowing horses and crew to be replaced as
needed. Fort Belknap served as one of these
stops. From there, the route passed just
beneath the current New Mexican Border,
hugging the Guadalupe Mountain Range.
This section of road was in use by the
Butterfield line from 1858-59. After 1859,
the Lower Road was preferred due
proximity to more military stations.

also connected fort installations across
central Texas.
The proposed TEP corridor crosses several
of these early routes, including a mapped
road through Hill County, west of Hillsboro,
that connected Fort Gates to Fort Graham,
both of which were constructed in 1849
(Scott 2012; Myres 2012; Foster et al.
2006). The TEP corridor also passes over at
least three roads connecting Fort Belknap to
other early settlements (Figure 2). Fort
Belknap was an early transportation hub on
the frontier and was the northern-most
military post when it was constructed in
1851 (Neighbours 2012). An early road
connecting Fort Belknap and Fort Hood lies
within the TEP corridor on the borders of
Park and Johnson Counties (Foster et al.
2006). Another road connected Fort Belknap
to Preston (fort and trading post). It ran
through present day Jack County, just westnorthwest of Jacksboro (Foster et al. 2006).
No trace of either road was discovered
during TEP field efforts.

The TEP corridor crosses the Butterfield
Overland Mail Route Corridor in Young
County, roughly 20 miles northeast of the
Fort Belknap site (Figure 3): Foster et al.
2006). No trace of the road was discovered
during TEP field efforts.
Cattle Trails
The TEP corridor crosses the Chisholm and
Shawnee trails, two nineteenth century cattle
trails. These trails functioned as networks of
paths connecting western ranches to cattle
hubs, linked by railroad, to northern
markets. Cattle trails such as the Chisholm
and the Shawnee cut wide ribboning swaths
through the landscape, only using
established paths at river crossings
(Worcester 2012).
The Shawnee trail is the oldest of the Texas
cattle trails. It ran from south Texas,
through Austin, Waco, Dallas and
Oklahoma, terminating in Kansas City. The
wide cattle path was the primary ranch-tomarket corridor through Texas from 1840
until the late-1860s (Gard 2012). The
proposed TEP corridor crosses the wide
Shawnee corridor in McLennan County,
northeast of Waco.

Butterfield Overland Mail Route
The Butterfield Overland Mail Route (185861) was the first transcontinental postal line
in the United States and ran from New York
(and other smaller hubs in the east) to St.
Louis via train and coach. From St. Louis,
the road was stage coach only and cut
through the rugged terrain of the southwest,
then up through California to San Francisco.
The route was created to service American
emigrants pushing west after the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in 1848,
ceding the southwest and California to the
United States.

The Chisholm Trail was in use from the late1860s until roughly 1884. The south Texas
portions of the trail followed the already
established Shawnee, but split at Waco,
heading on to Fort Worth and terminating in
Kansas. The trail was out of use by 1885

The mail route had two main branches in
Texas, known as the Upper and Lower
Roads. The Upper Road passed across north
Texas via the established Fort Smith to El
Paso Road. Stations were located along the

due to barbed wire demarcating property
lines and a quarantine law passed by the
State of Kansas in 1885 (Worcester 2012).
The TEP corridor cuts through several
alignments of the Chisholm Trail and feeder
trails in McLennan, Hill, and Johnson
Counties.

Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad (1865)
The Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, also
known as the M-K-T or the Katy, was
charter in 1865. The line was chartered
through the southern branch of the Union
Pacific Railway Company and connected
Texas to Missouri and Kansas for the first
time. Problems with obtaining land in Texas
slowed initial progress but the line finally
pushed into Texas, serving not only the
Dallas/Wichita Falls area but pushing south
to reach Waco, San Antonio, Houston, and
Galveston.
The line was finally
incorporated in Texas in 1891 (Hoffsommer
2012).

The cattle trail-era lasted roughly 40 years
across the mid-nineteenth century. No traces
of either of these cattle trails were
encountered during TEP field efforts.
Old San Antonio Road
The Old San Antonio Road is also known as
El Camino Real de los Tejas or the San
Antonio-Nacogdoches Road and dates to a
series of Spanish expeditions to the area in
1690, 1691, and 1693 (Figure 3). The road
was kept in use throughout the eighteenth
century as the major transportation corridor
through Texas, then one of four provinces of
New Spain.

The company continued to grow into the
twentieth century until going into
receivership in 1915. Despite, fluctuations
in gain, the Katy reached its apex during
World War II and then began to decline in
the 1950s. It was later acquired by the
Union Pacific and its subsidiary, the
Missouri Pacific (Hoffsommer 2012).

The series of roads that entered the current
Texas border from Mexico, ran in a
northeasterly orientation, with San Antonio
as a major hub. From San Antonio, the roads
split into several separate corridors,
providing wide access into the central Texas
region,
terminating
in
Nachitoches,
Louisiana. Road segments and alignments
varied year by year due to ground conditions
and/or threats from nearby Indian
communities.

The TEP corridor crosses the MissouriKansas-Texas Railroad in three places near
Riesel, McLennan County (Appendix D:
Sheets 47, 48, and 49; Foster et al. 2006),
one location north of Waco, McLennan
County (Appendix D: Sheet 43), and one
location north of Hearne, Robertson County
(Appendix D: Sheet 60).
Waco and Northwestern (Waco Tap)
(1866)

Currently, Highway 6, is the best preserved
example of the Old San Antonio Road. It is
intersected by the TEP corridor north of
Bryan, near the Brazos and Robertson
Counties border, The Lower Road, also
known as the La Bahia or Opelousas Road,
runs south of the Highway 6 corridor, It is
crossed by the TEP corridor in eastern
Grimes County. The Highway 6 corridor
will not be impacted by the TEP corridor.

The Waco and Northwestern, originally
name the Waco Tap Railroad Company, was
chartered in 1866. The line was created by
the citizens of Waco to connect the city to
Houston via the Houston and Texas Central
Railway. Due to slow progress by the Waco
and Northwestern, the Houston and Texas
Central agreed to complete the line and it
was sold to the company in 1873. While the

The TEP corridor crosses the Weatherford,
Mineral Wells, and Northwestern Railway
near Aledo in the southeastern portion of
Parker County (Appendix D: Sheet 23;
Foster et al. 2006).

Houston and Texas Central went into
receivership in 1885, the company
reacquired the Waco line in 1898. The
Houston and Texas Central Railway
operated the line until portions were
acquired by the Southern Pacific and the
Missouri Pacific in the 1960s (Werner
2012d).

Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway
(1881)
The Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway
built a line from Galveston to Fort Worth
between 1877 and 1881 (Werner 2012b). A
portion of this line was abandoned in the
vicinity of the project corridor north of
Blum, Hills County around 1945 (Appendix
D: Sheet 34). The line in this area was
relocated to the north in 1945 and the line
that still exists today was also crossed by the
project corridor (Appendix D: Sheet 34).
Another portion of the overall line was
located in northern Johnson County east of
Cresson, Texas (Appendix D: Sheet 26)

The TEP corridor crosses the Waco and
Northwestern north of Marlin in Falls
County (Appendix D: Sheet 51); east of
Waco in McLennan County (Appendix D:
Sheet 47; Foster et al. 2006); and east of
Northcrest in McLennan County (Appendix
D: Sheets 44 and 45).
Weatherford,
Mineral
Wells,
Northwestern Railway (1889)

and

The Weatherford, Mineral Wells, and
Northwestern Railway began as a short, 25
mile stretch of track constructed to connect
Weatherford to Mineral Wells (Cravens
2012). Mineral Wells became a popular
tourist attraction in the mid-1880s, after the
discovery that its local well water held
curative and medicinal properties. Before
the railway was chartered in 1889, the health
resort could only be reached by stagecoach
(Hunt 2012). The railway was completed in
1891 and was purchased by the Texas and
Pacific Railway in 1902. The Texas and
Pacific extended the track from Mineral
Wells as the health resort increased in
popularity.
The railway continued to
function as the primary mode of
transportation to the health resort throughout
the teens and twenties. By the 1930s, use
dropped, likely reflecting the growing
popularity of the automobile. By 1945, only
service tracks were in use. The line was
merged into the Missouri Pacific Railroad
Company in 1988 and the rails were
abandoned by 1992 (Cravens 2012).

Houston and Texas Central Railway (1850)
The Houston and Texas Central Railway
was
constructed
to
provide
rail
transportation from Houston into the interior
of Texas. The line was chartered in 1848
and the project became active in1852. The
line progressed over the next twenty five
years, reaching Austin via multiple towns in
1871.
During this time, the company
acquired other lines to expand its reaches in
the area, including the Waco and
Northwestern. The railway also partnered
with the MKT at Red River City in 1873,
establishing the first all rail-transcontinental
mail route in the United States (Werner
2012e).
The line was sold to Charles Morgan in
1877 and then came under the control of the
Southern Pacific in 1883. Despite this
acquisition, the company ran its own
operations until 1927, when the company
was lease to the Texas and New Orleans and
they took over operations (Werner 2012e).

Abandoned Railroad Grade (1890s)
Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway (1907)

In the late 1890s a railroad grade began to
be constructed between Bridgeport and
approximately 4 miles south of Boonsville,
Wise County, Texas. It is unclear which
company began construction of the railway.
It was abandoned before completion. The
failure to obtain a railroad and the decline in
cotton production in the surrounding area of
Boonsville between 1900 and 1910,
effectively stalled the town's growth (Minor
2012).

The Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway was
chartered to construct a rail line from
Johnson County to Beaumont (Young
2012a). Construction began in November
1902 and the line between Hillsboro and
Mexia was opened in October 1903. The
following January the section between
Hillsboro and Cleburne opened for service.
The railroad's profits were not as high as
expected and the line was sold to the
Colorado and Southern Railroad and the
Chicago Rock Island and Pacific, who
owned it jointly. Between 1905 and 1907,
224 miles of rail line was completed
between Mexia and Houston and from
Teague to Waxahachie (Young 2012a). In
1930, the Chicago Rock Island and Pacific
was reorganized as the Burlington Rock
Island Railroad (Young 2012a). The Rock
Island Railroad ceased operations in 1980,
but the jointly owned part of the line
between Dallas and Houston continues to be
operated by Burlington Northern (Werner
2012a).

The TEP corridor crosses the mapped
location of the abandoned railroad grade
west of the confluence of willow Creek and
Rock Hole Hollow Branch which is west of
SH 199, in southwestern Wise County,
Texas (Appendix D: Sheet 15).

The TEP corridor crosses the Trinity and
Brazos Valley Railway west of Godley in
central Johnson County (Appendix D: Sheet
28; Foster et al. 2006).
Chicago, Rock Island, Texas Railway
(1892)
The Chicago, Rock island, Texas Railway
was constructed to provide rail line from the
Texas-Oklahoma border to the Dallas Fort
Worth areas. The line between Bridgeport
and Jacksboro was constructed in 1899
(Zlatkovich 1981).

CHAPTER 5. METHODS
the project route. Segments were delineated
to include all previously recorded cultural
resources sites and “floodplains and terraces
adjacent to natural, relatively intact, USACE
jurisdictional waterways” along the TEP
project route.

Archaeological investigations for the TEP
project were designed to be of sufficient
intensity to determine the nature, extent, and,
if possible, significance of any cultural
resources located within a 300-foot-wide
survey corridor. The 300-foot-wide survey
corridor allowed for necessary right-of-way
(ROW)
adjustments
and
temporary
workspaces. The archaeological survey did
not include the entire 580-mile long project
route. Instead the field survey utilized a “first
terrace to first terrace” survey methodology
wherein only the terraces and floodplains
adjacent to natural, relatively intact USACE
jurisdictional waterways were examined. All
investigations were in accordance with the
standards and guidelines of the NHPA, the
THC’s minimum archaeological survey
standards, and the Council of Texas
Archaeologists Guidelines for Performance,
Curation, and Reports.

Utilizing this method, a total of 265
segments, two pump station locales, and
access roads totaling an estimated 120.5
miles and encompassing approximately
4,382 acres, were investigated in Archer,
Young, Jack, Wise, Parker, Tarrant,
Johnson, Hill, McLennan, Falls, Robertson,
Brazos, and Grimes counties. Additional
mileage was added as a result of re-routes
and access roads added during the field
survey efforts. Each segment was subjected
to an intensive pedestrian survey with deep
testing (backhoe trenching) in select locales.
The utilization of methods was keyed to the
level of disturbance and the nature of the
soils, geology, and topography along the
survey route.

SCOPE OF WORK
Prior to the field investigations, SWCA
presented a survey plan to the USACE Fort
Worth District and the THC for review and
approval. The Scope of Work presented a
summary of known cultural resources and
previously
conducted
archaeological
projects within a half-mile radius of the
proposed TEP corridor. It provided a review
of the soils and geology along the project
route and it detailed the proposed methods
for fieldwork, artifact collection, site
recording, and reporting. Maps showing the
proposed project route, known cultural
resources within or adjacent to the proposed
route,
and
areas
preselected
for
archaeological survey were included.

Pedestrian Survey/Shovel Testing
The field survey consisted of multiple teams
of SWCA archaeologists concurrently
surveying the predefined segments along the
286.5-mile long portion of the TEP route
within the Fort Worth District. The survey
included both pedestrian survey and shovel
testing within the survey corridor. The
ground surface and exposed soil profiles
were examined for evidence of cultural
resources. THC survey standards call for a
transect interval of 100 feet (30 meters) with
a minimum of 16 shovel tests excavated per
mile along each transect.
Shovel tests were excavated in 20centimeter (cm) arbitrary levels to one meter
in depth or to culturally sterile deposits,
whichever came first. All excavated soil

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
Prior to the onset of fieldwork, SWCA predefined segments to be investigated along
25

Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) at
some water crossings (where the pipeline
will be installed very deeply, below the level
of any archaeological deposits) precluded
the necessity for backhoe testing at some
locales. HDD is being conducted at the
Nolan River (Appendix D: Sheet 34),
Aquilla Creek (Appendix D: Sheet 41),
under Highway 77 (Appendix D: Sheet 43),
near the Tehuacana Creek (Appendix D:
Sheet 44), Sandy Creek (Appendix D: Sheet
49), Big Creek (Appendix D: Sheet 52),
Walnut Creek (Appendix D: Sheet 57), and
the Navasota River (Appendix D: Sheet 68).

was screened through ¼-inch mesh
hardware cloth to retrieve any cultural
materials that might be present. If it was
determined that shovel testing could not
adequately explore project impacts in soils
with the potential to contain buried
archaeological materials, backhoe trenching
was utilized. If backhoe trenching could not
be utilized at a particular location, shovel
tests and hand auger probes were excavated
as deeply as possible, down to 140 cmbs in
some cases.
The location of each shovel test was
recorded using a handheld Global
Positioning System (GPS) receiver. Data for
each shovel test was recorded on appropriate
field forms. Soils were described utilizing
standard terminology and colors were
identified with a Munsell Soil color chart.
Areas with previously recorded or newly
discovered cultural resources required
additional shovel testing, per THC
standards, to explore the nature and extent of
the cultural deposits.

Trenching involved close coordination with
third-party line locators where the proposed
alignment was in close proximity to existing
buried pipelines. If there were doubts that a
trench could be safely excavated (i.e.,
without hitting a buried utility line or
existing pipeline), the trench was moved to a
location where all underground utilities were
located with confidence.
Trenches were excavated to a depth
sufficient to determine the presence or
absence of buried cultural materials. This
also allowed for recording of any features
and geomorphic information to the depth of
project impacts. Generally, trenches were 2
meters deep, 8 meters in length, and 1.5
meters wide.

Deep Testing
Portions of the proposed TEP project
alignment encompass settings that have the
potential for deeply buried cultural
resources. These areas include alluvial
floodplains and terraces adjacent to some of
the numerous rivers and creeks within the
survey corridor (Appendix D). Areas with
alluvial deposits too deep to sufficiently
investigate by shovel testing were explored
by backhoe trenching.

Trenching was monitored by an experienced
archaeologist while digging was in progress.
SWCA archaeologists recorded stratigraphic
profile drawings with soil descriptions for
each trench. Any features that were
encountered during trenching were mapped
and photographed. All Occupational Safety
and Health Standards (OSHA) safety
protocols were followed during trenching
and all trenches were completely backfilled
and leveled upon completion of excavation
and recording.

Backhoe trenches were usually placed at 100
to 300-meter intervals, with tighter intervals,
when necessary. Trench placement was
based on the level of disturbance within the
survey corridor, the location of buried
utilities and pipelines, impenetrable
vegetation, and restrictions imposed by
landowners of agricultural fields.
26

Access Road Survey
Additional shovel tests were excavated, per
THC standards, at all identified sites to
define horizontal and vertical boundaries
and assess the nature of the cultural deposits.
Where practical, site delineation shovel tests
were excavated at 10-meter intervals in a
grid-like manner within the survey corridor.
A State of Texas Archaeological Site Form
was completed for each site discovered
during the investigations. A detailed plan
map of each site was produced, and site
locations were plotted on USGS 7.5-minute
topographic maps and relevant project maps.

Associated with the proposed TEP route are
a number of service roads that connect the
pipeline corridor with existing roads. These
will be used to access the pipeline for
construction and maintenance. Access
Roads consist of paved highways or county
roads, improved gravel-topped roads, and
two-track dirt roads. The area of potential
effect may vary depending on the level of
improvements needed for each access road.
Each access road was evaluated by
examining recent aerial photographs to
determine the level of investigation required
for each road. Criteria considered included
the setting (e.g., exposed parent material),
the condition of the road (e.g. heavily
disturbed), and any improvements that may
be needed for use of the road by
construction equipment.

CURATION
SWCA primarily conducted a non-collection
survey. Artifacts were tabulated, analyzed,
and documented in the field, but not
collected. Only diagnostic or especially rare
artifacts were collected. At the conclusion
of all field and reporting efforts, the
collected artifacts will either be returned to
the landowners from whose property they
were collected or will the Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory in
Austin.

Paved, gravel, cut, or built-up roads were
assessed as having a low potential for
archaeological sites. Roads with less than
75 percent ground surface visibility (such as
two-track dirt roads) were assessed as either
having a high or low probability for
archaeological sites and were then surface
surveyed or shovel tested, as appropriate.
When a survey was conducted, the SWCA
crew inspected a 10-meter-wide corridor
centered on the middle of the road. The
assessment and results of examination of
each access road is provided in Appendix G.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE RECORDING
All archaeological sites encountered during
the investigations were explored as
thoroughly as possible with consideration to
land access constraints. Each identified site
was assessed in regards to potential
significance so that recommendations could
be made for proper management (avoidance,
non-avoidance, or further work).
27

CHAPTER 6. RESULTS
The survey defined 33 previously
unidentified archaeological sites and
investigated portions of 2 previously
identified archaeological sites.
Sites
include: 21 prehistoric sites; 2 sites with
mixed historic and prehistoric cultural
components; and 12 historic Euroamerican
sites (including 3 cemeteries).

From December 2011 to August 2012,
SWCA
conducted
archaeological
investigations along the proposed 580-mile
Texas Express Pipeline project from
Skellytown
to
Mount
Belvieu.
Archaeological
investigations
were
completed for 265 segments within
anticipated USACE Fort Worth District
jurisdictional waterways.

SITE 41JA46 (FS Segment 2, Site 8)
During the investigations, approximately
4,382 acres were surveyed within a 300foot-wide
survey
corridor
totaling
approximately 120.5 miles in length.
Construction impacts will be restricted to an
estimated 80 to 90-foot-wide easement or
workspace in addition to any temporary
workspaces needed within the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor.

Site 41JA46 is an early- to mid-twentieth
century residential complex located within
Segment 78 in south central Jack County
approximately 0.4 miles southeast of the
intersection of Hwy 199 and Slusher Road
in Segment 77 (Appendix D: Sheet 12). The
site is situated within a relatively flat
agricultural setting overlooking Snake Creek
to the northwest. Vegetation consists of low
grasses and moderate mesquite.

The archaeological survey documented that
the proposed project corridor is heavily
disturbed by previous pipeline and public
utility construction and maintenance; as well
as residential, agricultural and ranching
activities. These modern disturbances have
minimized the potential for intact buried
cultural deposits along much of the proposed
project corridor.

The site consists of four features and a
refuse pile (Figure 4). Based upon the
distribution of features and surface artifacts,
the site dimensions are estimated at 80
meters north-south and 50 meters east-west.
Feature 1 is a concrete utility shed
containing a water heater and electrical
implements. It measures 7 feet east to west
and 6.25 feet north to south. Feature 2, is a
concrete house foundation with associated
driveway and sidewalks. Feature 3 is a stone
and fire-brick outdoor oven/incinerator
measuring 3.3 feet east to west and 10 feet
north to south. Feature 4 is a possible
well/sewer construction. The feature is
composed of two concrete rings set into the
ground with broken concrete lids both
measuring 3.3 feet in diameter.

The archaeological survey included the
excavation of a total of 5,995 shovel tests
and 61 backhoe trenches. Appendix I
provides a list of the surveyed segments and
describes the work completed for each
segment.
Archaeological data for all
subsurface tests and trenches are provided in
Appendix E and F. An assessment of each
access road for this part of the alignment is
provided in Appendix G. Thirteen of the
access roads were targeted for additional
investigation. A list of the locations of all
trenches is provided in Appendix K.

The refuse pile, located at the southeast
extent of the site, is composed of glass jars,
electrical components such as insulators and

switch plates, cinder blocks, corrugated
metal, tin cans, and milled lumber. All
structures have been removed leaving only
foundational remnants.
Eight shovel tests were excavated within the
site boundary (Figure 4). Soils consist of
moderately deep dark brown sandy clay
overlying basal clay. Subsurface impacts to
the site include mild erosion, grazing, and
mechanical vegetation clearing. All of the
shovel tests excavated within the site
boundary were negative for cultural
material. All features recorded are located
outside of the proposed workspace. The site
may extend west (outside) of the 300-footwide survey corridor.

Figure 5. Overview of Portion of Site 41JA47,
Drystone Wall.

Site 41JA46 is an early- to mid-twentieth
century residential complex. The site does
not retain sufficient integrity or context and
is unlikely to yield additional information
concerning the historic occupation of the
area. The site is recommended NOT
ELIGIBLE for inclusion in the NRHP and
SWCA recommends no further work.

Portions of the wall have been destroyed by
flooding episodes or property owners, and
contain barbed wire in the missing sections.
No structures or artifacts were observed in
association with the wall. Based upon the
dimensions of the wall, the site boundary is
estimated at 750 meters northwest-southeast
and 5 meters northeast-southwest (Figure 7).
SWCA historians could not establish
association with Fort Richardson or local
ranching practices in the area.

SITE 41JA47 (FS Segment 2, Site 7)
Site 41JA47 is a mid-ninetieth century
drystone wall located near the boundaries of
Fort Richardson State Park in Segment 85
(Appendix D: Sheet 10). The site is located
roughly 1.25 miles south of Fort Richardson
State Park in central Jack County. The site is
situated atop two small hills within broad,
rolling uplands with a tributary to Lost
Creek bisecting the site. Vegetation consists
of short pasture grasses and sparse cedar and
mesquite. An overview photograph of the
drystone wall is provided in Figure 5.

Seven shovel tests were excavated within
the site boundary. Soils consist of shallow
dark yellowish brown clay loam overlying
bedrock. Subsurface impacts to the site
include erosion, mechanical vegetation
clearing, and agricultural activities. All of
the shovel tests excavated within the site
boundary were negative for cultural
material.

The drystone wall, trends northwest to
southeast and averages roughly 150 cm in
height and 50 cm in thickness (Figure 6). It
is composed of locally sourced dry stacked
limestone cobbles and slabs with the bulk of
the wall consisting of 8 to 12 courses,
depending upon the thickness of the slabs,

Dry stone construction was a common
technique throughout the early years of the
United States and Texas. Techniques were
likely brought to the US from skilled
immigrants coming from places like
England and Scotland, where drystone wall

located near historic Fort Richardson. The
site is entirely surficial and composed only
of the single feature. No additional artifacts

construction dominated the countryside and
provided the foundation of the enclosure
movement (the Inclosure Acts of
Parliament) of the eightieth and ninetieth
centuries. During this movement drystone
walls were used for livestock grazing,
herding, and land dividing.
In Texas,
drystone walls can still be found on early
Anglo-American ranches dating from the
mid- to late-ninetieth century and are
associated with cattle herding and the
establishment of pasture boundaries, much
like in Britain.

While preliminary research of the wall did
not reveal the exact construction dates and
association of the Fort Richardson, the wall
serves an excellent example of historic-age
dry stone building technique in the area.
Further, the wall retains integrity of location,
design, materials, setting, workmanship, and
feeling.
SWCA recommends the drystone wall as
POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE for inclusion in
the NRHP under Criterion C in the area of
engineering.
AVOIDANCE
is
recommended for 41JA47. The proposed
centerline of the Texas Express pipeline has
since been rerouted to the south avoiding the
wall. As such, site 41JA47 will no longer be
impacted by construction of the pipeline and
no further work is recommended.

Drystone walls were exceedingly popular
for livestock and agricultural use for several
reasons. They are simple to construct and
do not require a complex set of tools
provided adequate local stone sources.
Drystone walls function through gravity and
frictional resistance without relying on
mortar or a footing. This creates a more
flexible structure, which can handle small
shifts as the ground settles under the weight
of the wall. Lack of mortar also allows for
less freezing and shrinkage during winter
months, prolonging the life of the wall over
time. Thus dry stone walls, if constructed
well, are durable, flexible, and relatively
easy to repair (Dry Stone Conservancy
2012). These factors likely played a role in
the extended life of the nineteenth century
wall at 41JA47.

SITE 41WS94
Site 41WS94 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located within Segment 65 approximately
0.4 miles northwest of the intersection of CR
3848 and CR 3849 in southwest Wise
County (Appendix D: Sheet 15).
The site was first recorded in 2009 by Burns
& McDonnell and is described as an
unknown prehistoric site containing lithic
debitage, burned rock, and possible ground
stone fragments. A surface scatter was noted
as well as a possible thermal feature eroding
from a road cut at 90 to 200 cmbs. The site
was estimated to be 140 meters northwest to

to
Site 41WS94 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located entirely within the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor and consists of four
debitage. SWCA found the site to be
completely surficial in nature with no
indication of intact buried deposits. The site
has been heavily impacted by transmission
line and pipeline construction, sand mining,
mechanical vegetation clearing, and
vehicular traffic.

At the time of the initial survey, the site had
already been impacted by a sand mine and
dirt two-track roads. The recorder noted that
the surface component lacked integrity but
the buried deposit may remain intact.
Although the original recorders of the site
conducted no shovel testing to validate the
estimated depth of deposits, they
recommended avoidance or monitoring if
construction was necessary.

Site 41WS94 does not retain sufficient
integrity or context and is unlikely to yield
additional information concerning the
prehistory of the area. The site is
recommended
NOT
ELIGIBLE
for
inclusion in the NRHP.
SWCA
recommends no further work.

The current investigation found the site to be
heavily disturbed. The site is located within
an open transmission line corridor paralleled
by a buried pipeline corridor, and the
immediate area is still being impacted by
sand mining and vehicular traffic.

SITE 41PR155 (FS Segment 2 Site 9)
Vegetation is sparse within the two existing
corridors and consists of various low grasses
and shrubs. Dense clusters of oaks boarder
each side of the currently proposed ROW.
The current investigation determined that
the site encompassed an area approximately
32 x 30 meters in size.

Site 41PR155 is an early- to mid-twentieth
century agricultural complex located within
Segment 39 in east central Parker County
(Appendix D: Sheet 22). The site is situated
within gently undulating uplands dominated
by pasture land. A small tributary to the
Trinity River is located to the north.
Vegetation consists of short pasture grasses
and sparse mesquite allowing only low
surface visibility.

Intensive pedestrian survey of the area
identified two pieces of debitage. All road
cuts were inspected, but no evidence of the
previously recorded deeply buried deposits,
thermal features, or any additional artifacts
were observed.

The site consists of two circular, concrete
troughs and one above ground cistern with
associated collar (Figure 9). The troughs
measure approximately 10 feet in diameter
and are located along the western portion of
the site. The cistern is composed of tabular
bedrock fragments cemented together with a
concrete collar. Long, slender slabs of
bedrock protrude from the outside wall of
the cistern to provide steps to the top of the
structure. In addition, remnants of a fence
line were observed leading toward a
windmill located outside the currently
proposed ROW.

Nine shovel tests were excavated within the
site boundary (Figure 8). Soils consist of
light brown sandy loam terminating at
depth.
One of the shovel tests excavated within the
site boundary was positive for cultural
material. Shovel Test B3, located within the
cleared transmission line corridor, contained
two debitage at 0–10 cmbs. All additional
shovel
tests
were
excavated
to
approximately 100 cmbs and were negative
for cultural materials

and sparse hardwoods allowing for moderate
surface visibility.

No surface artifacts were observed in
association with the structures. The site lies
within an open transmission line corridor
and has been impacted by the construction
of multiple pipelines. Based upon the
distribution of the structures, the site
dimensions are estimated at 25 meters northsouth and 35 meters east-west.

Site 41PR156 consists of six structures, a
windmill, a concrete trough, two
foundations, an access road, fencing that
surrounds the farmstead, and the associated
fields (Figure 10). The site encompasses an
area measuring 92x60 meters in size.

Soils consist of very shallow very dark
brown sandy clay overlying bedrock. No
shovel tests were excavated within the site
boundary due to the lack of deposition and
extensive disturbance. Subsurface impacts to
the site include two buried pipelines, a
transmission line, and grazing.

Feature 1 is a circa 1930 bungalow. It has a
slightly rectangular plan and measures
roughly 25 by 30 feet. The front façade of
the building faces east but the building is
oriented very slightly east-southeast (Figure
11).
The main portion of the roof is front gabled
and is clad in both the remnants of
composition shingles and particle board.
Other details include exposed rafter tails and
an external chimney constructed of brick on
the south roof deck. Framing is wood and
the building is clad in lapped board siding.

Site 41PR155 is an early- to mid-twentieth
century agricultural complex composed of
two water troughs and an above ground
cistern. The site is entirely surficial in nature
and has no potential for intact buried
deposits. The site has also been heavily
impacted by pipeline and transmission line
construction.

The foundation appears to be constructed of
a concrete perimeter grade beam. The house
configuration is two-by two bay. Windows
are original wood sash and are one-over-one
type. There are two single-entry doorways
on the east façade of the building. The door
on the south side of the two entrances has
been replaced.

Site 41PR155 does not retain sufficient
integrity or context and is unlikely to yield
additional information concerning the
historic occupation of the area. The portion
of Site 41PR155 located within the 300foot-wide survey corridor is recommended
as NOT ELIGIBLE for listing in the NRHP
and no further work is recommended. The
portion of the site located outside of the 300foot-wide
survey
corridor
remains
UNEVALUATED for listing in the NRHP.

A porch is also located on the east façade
and runs most of the length of the elevation.
It is covered by a lower gabled roof, clad in
composition shingles, with exposed rafter
tails and beams. The porch columns are of
brick capped with concreted. Posts are midtwentieth century wrought iron type. The
porch foundation is concrete slab.

SITE 41PR156 (FS Segment 2 Site 1)
Site 41PR156 is an early-twentieth century
farm complex located within Segment 57 in
central Parker County, approximately 0.14
miles southwest of the intersection of Sarra
Road and Old Agnes Road (Appendix D:
Sheet 18). The site is situated atop a
prominent rise overlooking an unnamed
tributary to Strickland Creek to the southeast
Vegetation consists of short pasture grasses

An addition can be found on the west
elevation of the building. It has a partial
hipped roof and exposed rafter tails. Extant
cladding is the same composition shingle
found on the house. Windows are one-overone, wooden, and match the other windows

of the house. A single-entry back door is
located on the west elevation of the addition.

Feature 3 is a sub-grade storm cellar
constructed of poured-in-place concrete
(Figure 13) and bears a possible construction
date of “May 22, 1949” and the name “S.F.
Wright”. It is located approximately 12 feet
behind or to the west of the house. The walls
are visible above grade and are capped with
a concrete shed roof. The entrance is located
on the south side and consists of concrete
stairs.

Overall, the house is in fair condition. There
is roofing and window damage along with
the loss of one of the original front doors.
However, the addition on the west elevation
is sympathetic and likely dates to the age of
the house.
A small fenced yard surrounds the house
(Feature 1) and Features 3 through 5 (Figure
10). Crimped wire fencing is used around
the house yard and is secured with wooden
posts.
Feature 2 is a small one-bay garage located
just outside the house yard and
approximately 50 feet northeast of the house
(Figure 12). The garage has a front gabled
roof clad in composition shingles with
exposed rafter tails. Building framing is
wood. It appears to have been originally
clad in horizontal board but this cladding is
now covered with vinyl siding. The façade
of the small building faces south and
consists of two openings. The first is a
double-door constructed of vertical board.
This is flanked by a single-entry door to the
west, also constructed of vertical board.
Feature 2 is currently is fair to poor
condition, with newer unsympathetic uses of
materials.

Figure 13. Overview of Cellar (Feature 3) at Site
41PR156.

Feature 4 is a small square-plan pump house
(Figure 14). It is associated with Feature 5
(windmill and well). The pump-house has a
metal clad side gabled roof with exposed
rafter tails and beams. The building is
constructed of red concrete brick. A cut
piece of metal acts as a door on the east
elevation. The small building is in relatively

Site 41PR156
Figure 16. Overview of Shed (Feature 7) at Site
41PR156

Feature 5 is an aerometer windmill and well.
The windmill is no longer working and the
sucker rod has been cut.

Feature 8 is a small, square poured-in-place
concrete trough. It is located approximately
30 feet northeast of Feature 7.

Feature 6 is a shed located outside the house
yard and approximately 90 feet southwest of
the house (Figure 15). It has a front gabled
metal roof and has an extended shed roof
addition on the south elevation.
The
building has a wooden frame and is clad in
metal. The shed roofed addition is enclosed
on three sides, with the east elevation open.
This building is currently used as a storage
shed and is in fair to poor condition.

Feature 9 consists of all the fencing
enclosing the agricultural fields and the
house yards. This varies in type from
ornamental crimped wire used around the
house yard to barbed wire and hog wire used
around pastures.
Feature 10 is a two track road that functions
as the house driveway. It leads from Old
Agnes Road to the house yard in an
east/west orientation.
Feature 11 consists to two foundations of
recently demolished buildings.
These
buildings appear on aerial photographs from
the mid-1990s but are no longer extant.
Feature 12 consists of the plowed fields
located around the house and outbuildings.
A natural drainage is located to the south of
the complex.

Figure 15. Overview of Shed (Feature 6) at Site
41PR156

Six shovel tests were excavated within the
site boundary (Figure 11). Soils are
moderately deep sandy and silty loams.
Subsurface impacts to the site include mild

boundary fence. The land gradually slopes
down to the northeast towards Beene Creek,
which is about 150 feet from the boundary
of the cemetery. The cemetery itself
contains maintained grass with a modern
outer boundary fence and one interior family
specific fence plot. The northwest section of
the cemetery is void of grave stones and
contains 3-5 full sized oak trees (Figure 17).

disturbances associated with agricultural
activities.
Two shovel tests within the site boundary
were positive for cultural material. Shovel
Test B138 contained two shards of historic
glass, one milk glass fragment, and one
piece of metal at 0–30 cmbs. Shovel Test
B139 contained one piece of whiteware at
0–30 cmbs.

The cemetery consists of approximately 34
tombstones, many with accompanying
footstones (Table 4). The majority of the
tombstones appear to be in a linear position
in north-south rows that face east-west. A
small number of unmodified limestone
grave markers that are not arranged in any
linear manner are located within the
organized rows. Some of the unmodified
limestone boulders are upright as well as
two lying flat that may be a type of crypt.

Site 41PR156 is an early- to mid-twentieth
century farm complex consisting of six
structures, a windmill, a concrete trough,
two foundations, an access road, fencing,
and the associated fields. Historic- artifacts
were found in two shovel tests and are likely
associated with the site complex. The farm
complex is in fair to poor condition and
currently appears to be unoccupied. The
surrounding pastures are currently in use.
The complex retains integrity of location,
setting, and association.

The headstones were mostly constructed
from white marble with nearly all containing
cracks that represent impacts, likely due to
falling or being pushed over. At some point
in the past these headstones were repaired,
perhaps by the cemetery society.

Due to lack of use as a residence, removal of
associated buildings, and replacement or
poor repair of materials and workmanship
on multiple buildings, the complex lacks
integrity of design, materials, workmanship,
and feeling.
Further, the small rural
landscape and set of buildings is not unusual
to the area nor is it the work of a master
designer.

The large number of broken headstones and
the jumbled unmodified limestone grave
markers indicate the cemetery may have
been impacted by heavy machinery at some
point. This disturbance could have displaced
the unmodified limestone grave markers
from their original location.

Site 41PR156 is recommended NOT
ELIGIBLE for NRHP listing. Site 41PR156
is located outside of the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor and will not be affected as
currently designed. SWCA recommends no
further work.

The dates on the main group of tombstones
vary from the late 1860s to 1890s. The
dates within the inner fenced area and the far
Southwest section vary from the late 1870s
to the 1930s. No tombstones are located in
the northeast and northwest section of the
cemetery.

SITE 41PR157 (Canafax-Brawley Cemetery)
The Canafax-Brawley cemetery (41PR157)
is a maintained historic cemetery located on
Beene Creek Trail Road, 100 feet north of
the proposed centerline in the vicinity of
Segment 55 in Parker County, (Appendix D:
Sheet 18). The general environment is
maintained grass pasture with large oak trees

The outer boundary fence is a relatively new
addition by current landowner Terry Green,
who stated that he replaced an older fence
and put the new one in the same location.

current cemetery boundary. The cemetery
site was recorded with a sub meter accurate
GPS unit and with a sketch map.
Information available from the tombstone
engravings was recorded in field notes.

The investigation included a 100%
pedestrian survey of the cemetery and the
surrounding areas to look for any evidence
of any cultural material outside of the
42

site dimensions are estimated at 125 meters
east-west and 120 meters north-south.

Shovel testing was conducted within the
proposed centerline right of way. All shovel
test units were culturally sterile and shallow
with units terminated due to clays and
bedrock. Mechanical scraping using a
Gradall was employed across the workspace
and centerline area within 100 feet of the
cemetery. Approximately 60 percent of the
area was scraped to 60-90 cmbs, well into
very firm basal clays and fossil-rich
bedrock. No unmarked graves or anomalies
were identified in the ROW.

Six shovel tests were excavated within the
site boundary (Figure 18).
Soils are
shallow, light brown silty loam overlying
bedrock. Large areas of exposed bedrock
and degraded bedrock on the surface were
observed. No cultural materials were found
in the shovel tests.Subsurface impacts to the
site include heavy erosional vegetation
clearing, and maintained county roads.
Site 41JN67 is a very diffuse prehistoric
lithic scatter. The site is entirely surficial in
nature and lacks potential for intact buried
deposits. The site has been heavily impacted
by erosion leaving the majority of the site
destroyed.

Site 41PR157, Canafax-Brawley Cemetery
site is a maintained historic cemetery
containing 42 graves dating from 1864 to
1935. At this time, there is insufficient
information to make a recommendation of
whether the site is eligible for listing in the
NRHP, therefore the cemetery remains
UNEVALUATED. Site AVOIDANCE is
required pursuant to Texas State Law
(Chapters 694-715 of the Health and Safety
Code) and Texas Administrative Code (Title
13, Part 2, Chapter 22).
SWCA
recommends that an archaeologist familiar
with the site should erect a safety barrier
fence along the margins of the workspace to
ensure no disturbance during pipeline
construction.

Site 41JN67 does not retain sufficient
integrity or context and is unlikely to yield
additional information concerning the
prehistory of the area.
The site is
recommended as NOT ELIGIBLE for listing
in the NRHP. The site is located outside of
the 300-foot-wide survey corridor and will
not be affected by the current project.
SWCA recommends no further work.
SITE 41JN68 (FS Segment 2 Site 2)
Site 41JN68 is an historic scatter and check
dam
located
within
Segment
18
approximately one mile west of the
intersection of HWY 171 and FM 2331 in
central Johnson County (Appendix D: Sheet
28). The site is situated on a gradual
northwest trending slope within broad,
undulating uplands dominated by cleared
agricultural fields. An unnamed tributary of
West Nolan Creek lies just to the east.
Vegetation consists of short pasture grasses
allowing only moderate surface visibility.

SITE 41JN67 (FS Segment 2 Site 4)
Site 41JN67 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located within Segment 1 just west of the
intersection of CR 1224A and CR 1106 in
southeast Johnson County (Appendix D:
Sheet 33). The site is situated within rocky,
undulating uplands located northeast of Elm
Hollow. Vegetation consists of moderate
cedar, mesquite, and cacti allowing for high
surface visibility.
Four pieces of debitage (one possibly
modified) were observed on the surface of a
highly erosional slope with little to no
deposition and exposed bedrock. Based
upon the distribution of surface artifacts, the

The site is composed of historic and modern
debris as well as a check dam. A photograph
of a similar check dam is provided in Figure

ELIGIBLE for inclusion in the NRHP. No
further work is recommended.
SITE 41JN69 (FS Segment 2 Site 10)
Site 41JN69 is an early- to mid-twentieth
century agricultural complex located within
Segment 17 approximately 0.25 miles south
of the intersection of FM 2331 and CR 1231
in west central Johnson County, (Appendix
D: Sheet 28). The site is situated on a very
minor north trending slope within expansive
agricultural fields, and a tributary to the
West Nolan River lies to the southeast.
Vegetation consists of short pasture grasses
and planted cedars. Subsurface impacts to
the site include mild erosion and grazing.

stoneware, porcelain, milk glass, brick, and
miscellaneous metal debris. The scatter is
located in and around a dry stacked field
stone check dam located within an erosional
drainage. The surrounding area has been
subject to continuous plowing and extensive
earth movement to construct to stock ponds.

Four shovel tests were excavated within the
site boundary due to the very thin deposits
(Figure 21). Soils consist of very shallow
dark brown clay loam overlying bedrock.

Only two shovel tests were excavated within
the site boundary due to the shallow and
disturbed nature of the soils (Figure 20).
Soils within the area are shallow dark brown
clay loam overlying bedrock. Subsurface
impacts to the site include agricultural
activities and erosion.

All of the shovel tests excavated within the
site boundary were negative for cultural
material. Six features were noted at the site
including a collapse house, a cellar, a
well/windmill, a concrete trough, a fenced
cattle pen, and two concrete footings.

Both of the shovel tests excavated within the
site boundary were positive for cultural
material. Shovel tests B4 and B8 both
encountered clear glass shards at 0–5 cmbs.
Based upon the distribution of positive
shovel tests and surface artifacts, the site
dimensions are estimated at 35 m northsouth and 35 m east-west.

Feature 1 is an almost completely collapsed
house (Figure 22). It was constructed with a
wooden frame and cladding. Evidence of
window type, plan, or other details are no
longer extant. The house likely dates to pre1950 based on extant materials and wiring
associated with the site.

Site 41JN68 is an historic debris scatter and
check dam. Two positive shovel tests
contained clear glass at shallow depths, and
the remainder of the site is surficial in
nature. The area has been impacted by
continuous agricultural activities, pond
construction, and erosion. Due to these
disturbances, Site 41JN68 does not retain
sufficient integrity or context and is unlikely
to yield additional information concerning
the historic occupation of the area. The site
is located entirely within the 300-foot-wide

Feature 2 is a stone rubble and mortar storm
cellar (Figure 23). It is designed with a
barrel vault shape, rectangular plan, and
below grade stone steps to reach the entry.
The small straight stairwell is lined with a
thick stone rubble and mortar wall. The
entrance is capped with a stone lintel and
located on the south elevation. Two small
windows can be found on either side of the
entrance. The windows are an unusual

that the Walker or Lawrence family were
historic significant, nor were they or the
property involved in any events of historic
significance (Johnson County Deed Records
1937 and 1968).
Site 41JN69 is an early- to mid-twentieth
century farm complex consisting of a
collapse house, a cellar, a well/windmill, a
concrete trough, a fenced cattle pen, and two
concrete footings. Archaeological findings
are surficial in nature, and no associated
artifacts could be located. The site has been
heavily impacted by neglect, leaving the
house (Feature 1) almost completely
collapsed.
Only the concrete trough
(Feature 6) is located within the proposed
workspace. That portion of the site located
within the proposed workspace is
recommended as NOT ELIGIBLE for listing
in the NRHP and no further work is
recommended. That portion of the site
located outside of proposed workspace
remains unevaluated for listing in the
NRHP.

face south to the house yard. Feature 3 is a
windmill and well, located approximately 85
feet west-southwest from the house. Feature
4 is a concrete trough, likely associated with
Feature 5, a fenced cattle pen.
Feature 6 consists of two concrete footings
located southeast of the house. No surface
or subsurface artifacts were observed in
association with any of the above mentioned
features, but modern refuse was observed
throughout the site. Based upon the
distribution of surface features, the site
dimensions are estimated at 95 m northsouth and 90 m east-west.

SITE 41JN70 (FS Segment 2 Site 5)
Site 41JN70 is an early- to mid-twentieth
century agricultural complex located within
Segment 14 in west central Johnson County
approximately one mile southwest of the
intersection of FM 1192 and CR 1229
(Appendix D: Sheet 29; Figure 24). The site
is situated atop a small hill within a large
pasture. The West Fork of Nolan River is
located to the north. Vegetation consists of
low pasture grasses and sparse mesquite.

Deed research reveals that the house and
other buildings on the property were likely
owned by Bettie Walker in the 1930s. Ms.
Walker sold the property to E.A. Lawrence
in 1937 and his family held the title until the
48

Figure 24. Map of Site 41JN70.

The site consists of one partially collapsed
barn, two wells, a pump house, and two
large brick scatters (Figure 24). Based upon
the distribution of features and historic-aged
debris, the site dimensions are estimated at
140 m north-south and 90 m east-west.
Subsurface impacts to the site include
erosion, dirt roads, stock pond construction,
and cattle grazing.
Feature 1 is a partially collapsed barn
(Figure 25). The metal clad roof and gable
are all that remain of the building and the
area around the roof is littered associated
building materials. Based on these materials
and the extant roof, it appears that the
building was built with a wood frame and
cladding.

Feature 2 is a circular well constructed of
cement mortar and stone rubble (Figure 26).
Feature 3 (Figure 27) is similar to Feature 2
but is located along the drainage/pond area
and next to Feature 4. Feature 4 is a stone
rubble and cement mortar pump house
(Figure 28). The roof is flat and of concrete.
Both Features 3 and 4 are partially
submerged in the drainage/pond system.

Deed Research reveals that the structures are
likely associated with the Wilhite or Powell
families. The Wilhites were known in the
area and Mr. W.M. Wilhite ran a local music
school (Johnson County History Book
Committee 1985) in the late nineteenth
century. They sold the property to the
Powell family in 1938, who held it until

1945, when they sold it to John and La
Frances Manning (Johnson County Deed
Records 1938 and 1945). Archival research
did not reveal that any of these families were
involved with any events of historic
significance in the area.
Seven shovel tests were excavated within
the site boundary (Figure 24). Soils consist
of shallow dark yellowish brown silty loam
overlying bedrock. All of the shovel tests
excavated within the site boundary were
negative for cultural material.

The house evolved from a one-room cabin
with a limestone chimney and foundation
that dates to c. 1881-1897. Additions were
added in the late nineteenth century and
early twentieth century. The house follows
no set plan and evolved organically as the
family grew. It remains in good condition
with little alterations.

Site 41JN70 is an early- to mid-twentieth
century agricultural complex, with collapsed
or impacted structures. Portions of the site
are located within and immediately adjacent
to the 300-foot-wide survey corridor. Site
41JN70 lacks integrity in all areas: location,
design, setting, workmanship, materials,
feeling, and association. Further, the extant
structures and buildings on the site are not
unusual examples of design or were they
created by a master designer, nor are they
associated with any persons or events of
significance. Site 41JN70 is recommended
NOT ELIGIBLE for listing in the NRHP
under Criteria C and D.

One of the original farm storage buildings, a
corn crib, dates from the early twentieth
century and is located to the north of the
house. It is similarly wood framed on a
limestone foundation and has a gabled
corrugated metal roof.
The undisturbed archeological sites on the
farmstead include historic archeological
deposits surrounding the house. This deposit
includes clothing fragments, foodstuff
remains, product packages, portions of
cooking and eating utensils, paper fragments
with printing, packing crate materials, and
personal artifacts such as toys, razors and
jewelry. A second archeological site is
located near the corn crib in the former
barnyard area and includes a concentration
of agricultural and animal objects such as
product packages, fencing materials, tools,
animal shoes, building fragments, farm
implement remnants and heating devices.

SITE 41HI326 (J.T. Baker Farmstead)
The J.T. Baker Farmstead is located in
Segment HI3RR, approximately 1.2 miles
north of Blum in Hill County, Texas
(Appendix D: Sheet 34). The J.T. Baker
Farmstead was listed in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1992
under Criteria C and D in the areas of
Architecture and Archeology with a period
of
significance
from
1881-1941
(#92000138).
From the NRHP Nomination:
The J.T. Baker Farmstead is a preserved
representative example of a late-ninetieth
and early-twentieth century central [sic]
Texas cotton raiser’s farmstead. The central
feature of the 100 acre farmstead is a boardand-batten frame dwelling and associated

Two domestic trash dumps, started in 1880
and 1945 respectively, are located to the east
of the house. Visible surface material
includes crockery, china, ironstone glass,
metals, rubber and Bakelite.

location of the Battle of Blum Creek in
relation to the TEP project corridor. The
Battle of Blum Creek occurred on March 21,
1801 and consisted of a confrontation
between the Nolan Expedition and Spanish
Forces (Wilson and Jackson 1987).
Research conducted by Wilson and Jackson
(1987) suggests that the TEP project
corridor does not bisect the two possible
areas in which it is thought that the
confrontation took place (Figure 30). Two
areas are depicted in Figure 30, one located
southwest of the city of Blum and the other
approximately 1.5 miles northeast of Blum.
The THC recommended that a metal
detection survey be conducted to determine
if there was any evidence of the battle within
the survey corridor.

The railroad right-of-way bisects the
farmstead and was constructed by the Gulf,
Colorado and Santa Fe Railway in 1881.
The railroad shaped life on the farm for 64
years until its relocation in 1945 to the north
of the property. The right-of-way includes
an earthen embankment and wooden
crossties (the steel tracks were removed
when the line was relocated). It crosses an
unnamed creek on top of a limestone and
brick culvert that dates from the time of
construction. Alongside the railroad are
additional
archeological
deposits
representing 64 years of rail use. In addition
to the archeological remains, there are
railway company-built barbed-wire fences
with split bois d-arc posts.
SWCA reviewed the NRHP document and
noticed an oil or gas pipeline on the
topographic map that travels through the
property in a northeasterly to southwesterly
direction. This pipeline is not included in the
NRHP documentation as a non-contributing
resource. The nomination does not include
an inventory of the NRHP-listed resources
yet states it includes two contributing
buildings, one contributing site, two
contributing structures for a total of five
historic resources. The farmstead is listed as
a district that includes the associated
agricultural land and pastures.
Texas
Express
Consultations
Landowner and THC

Since that meeting, Texas Express officials
or officials working on their behalf
consulted with the descendants of the J.T.
Baker Farmstead on site and moved the
pipeline even further away from the standing
structures to the west to avoid impacting the
farmstead and the current route only clips a
corner of the property in an open pasture
(Figure 29).
SWCA Archaeological Investigations
Archaeological investigations of the J.T.
Baker Farmstead within the project corridor
consisted of a pedestrian surface survey,
shovel testing, and metal detector survey.

with

Two shovel tests were excavated in the
portion of the Baker Farmstead within the
survey corridor (Appendix D: Sheet 34). No
artifacts were recovered from shovel tests or
pedestrian survey within the survey corridor.

SWCA personnel met with the Texas
Historical Commission in March 2012
regarding the proposed pipeline crossing this
NRHP-listed farmstead (Figure 29). The
initial project maps showed the proposed
pipeline crossing open pasture land far from
any historic above ground resources. At that
meeting, THC was largely concerned with
archeological remains as the proposed
pipeline would not cause any permanent
visual effect on the NRHP-listed property.

A metal detector survey recovered a total of
34 ferrous artifacts (Appendix I). Among the
recovered artifacts was a railroad spike (JL7) that is possibly associated with the
portion of rail line within the farmstead.
Other artifacts recovered included a lynch
pin (JL-1), a possible trunk strap (JL-8), a
cut nail fragment, a utensil handle (SS 5),

In addition, concerns were raised regarding
whether or not there was evidence of the

recovered metal artifacts can be attributed to
domestic or agricultural use. However, the
artifacts may not be directly associated with
the J.T. Baker Farmstead or Battle of Blum
Creek.

The markers are located approximately 500
meters west and 100 meters south of the
intersection of Rattlesnake Road and Little
Rattler Road. The grave stones are located
near the base of the trees as depicted in
Figures 31 through 33.

Archaeologically, only ephemeral evidence
of a historic occupation was identified
within the current survey corridor. In
consultation with the THC, SWCA obtained
an archaeological site number for the J.T.
Baker Farmstead, even though the farmstead
is listed as a National Historic District.
Conclusions
An oil and gas pipeline was extant under the
farm prior to the NRHP designation and this
had no impact on eligibility. The currently
proposed pipeline is located far from any
above ground historic resource at the site.
Although the current project corridor
alignment intersects a corner of the NRHP
listed property and district, the proposed
pipeline alignment has been rerouted from
its original configuration to avoid any
contributing elements of its listing in the
NRHP. No intact archaeological deposits
were encountered.

It is SWCA's opinion that the proposed
pipeline will have NO ADVERSE EFFECT
to
potential
archaeological
deposits
associated with J.T. Baker Farmstead.
SWCA recommends that no additional work
be required.

On March 6, 2012, SWCA conducted
mechanical scraping approximately 5 feet
west of the existing pipeline. The area
scraped measured approximately 70 feet in
length and was excavated to approximately
3 feet in depth (Figures 34, 37, and 38).
Only natural changes in stratigraphy were
encountered. No anomalies suggestive of
grave were encountered and no artifacts
were identified. Due to the unclear location
of the actual grave shafts, SWCA
recommended that remote sensing should be
utilized to determine if the grave shafts were
located in the general vicinity of the current
grave markers.
SWCA Geophysicist, Blake Weissling
designed and performed a geophysical
survey of the immediate area surrounding
the grave markers to determine where the
grave shafts may be in relation to the current
300-foot-wide survey corridor. A complete
report of these findings is provided in
Appendix J. The work was conducted in
two stages on March 14 and 22, 2012.

Headstone #3 includes inscriptions on three
sides: Cornelia M. Punchard; Enola
Punchard; and C.E. Punchard.
C. E.
Punchard was most likely Cornelius Ennis
Punchard who was born in Austin and died
at age 33 in McLennan County. Corenlia

The anomalies measured approximately
15x20 feet in size, which would be
consistent with the small number of known
burials (Figure 39). No significant magnetic
response was associated with the current
location of the burial markers near the two
trees (Figure 39). Several dipole anomalies
most commonly associated with ferrous
(iron-based) metal objects such as nails,
wire, cans, etc were located during the
investigation. A representative example of
one of these anomalies is marked with the
black arrow in Figure 39.

The proposed pipeline will be installed in a
former pipeline trench to the east of the
markers.
Mechanical scraping and
geophysical investigations indicate that the
probable locations of the graves are outside
of the current workspace.
No further
scraping was conducted due to the slope of
the landform heading south-south-east. The
likelihood for encountering human remains
is low. However, SWCA recommends that
an archaeologist familiar with the site should
erect a safety barrier fence along the
margins of the workspace to ensure no
disturbance during pipeline construction.
Site 41ML302 remains UNEVALUATED
for listing in the NRHP.
SWCA
recommends AVOIDANCE and that the
proposed pipeline follow the permanent
right-of-way easement to the east of the
current location of the markers for the
previously constructed pipeline.

magnetic gradiometry (MG). A pre-survey
test of the effectiveness of GPR indicated
inappropriate soil conditions for this
technique, so this technique was abandoned.
Approximately 1,500 linear meters of
gradiometry data were collected along
transects spaced at 0.5 meters in two
adjacent survey grids running parallel to and
flanking the 300-foot-wide survey corridor.

SITE 41FA88 (FA13-FS1)
Site 41FA88 is a large prehistoric open
habitation
of
undetermined
cultural
affiliation within Segment FA13 and
FA13RR approximately 1,115 m west and
705 m south of the intersection of FM 46
and Highway 6 (Appendix D: Sheet 54). The
site is located on an upland ridge and side
slope that descends to the northwest to
Copperas Creek and the Little Brazos River

An analysis and interpretation of the
gradiometery data indicated a cluster of
magnetic anomalies approximately 13
meters (40 feet) south of the present location
of the cluster of headstones and footstones.

Archaeological investigation of Site 41FA88
consisted of pedestrian surface survey and

ranged from 0 to 5 percent. No artifacts or
features were observed on the surface of the
site.

drainage approximately 4.2 miles west of
Bremond, Texas. Overview photographs of
the field conditions at the time of
investigations are provided in Figures 40 and
41.
Site 41FA88 is ovoid in shape and measures
200 x 180m in size. It is located on both sides
of the current centerline of the proposed
pipeline (Figure 42). At the time of survey,
the western half of the site was located within
pasture with some isolated trees and the
eastern half was located within a large stand
of timber. The site is bisected by an existing
pipeline.

Forty-one subsurface tests have been
advanced on the upland ridge and side slope
within the current proposed survey corridor to
delineate the site (Figure 42). A typical
shovel test was excavated to a depth of 100
cmbs and exhibited two stratums in profile.
Stratum I consisted of stratified layers within
the E horizon consisting of reddish brown
(2.5YR 4/3) sandy loam to sand from 0 to 40
cmbs. Stratum II consisted of a strong brown
(2.5YR 5/6) to red (2.5YR 5/8) sandy clay to
clay.
A total of 32 of the 58 shovel tests were
positive for cultural material with artifacts
being recovered from as deep as 80 cmbs.
Table 6 provides an accounting of the artifacts
recovered by depth/stratum.
Artifacts recovered included 174 pieces of
debitage, 1 late-stage biface (Figure 43), 2
core fragments, and 5 pieces of fire-cracked
rock. Artifacts were recovered in two loci at
the site based on landform: Locus A at the top
of the ridge and Locus B at the base of the
upland foot slope and side slope. Artifacts
recovered from Stratum I (0 to 40 cmbs)
include 150 pieces of debitage, 1 late-stage
biface, 2 core fragments, and four pieces of
fire-cracked rock. Artifacts recovered from
Stratum II (40 to 60 cmbs) include 24 pieces
of debitage and piece of fire-cracked rock.
The majority of artifacts derived from Stratum
II (approximately 54 percent) were derived
from the transition from the E to B horizon.

artifacts were recovered down slope within
Locus B within near surface deposits that most
likely eroded to this position on the landform.
A total of 18 pieces of debitage were
recovered within the four positive shovel tests
excavated within the proposed workspace.
Eighty-four percent of these were derived
from 20 to 40 centimeters below ground
surface. No trenches were excavated at the
site, due to the type of soils and artifacts (all
lithic) being recovered from near surface
deposits.

Figure 43. Late Stage Biface Recovered from Site
41FA88 (FA13-FS1)

Soils at Site 41FA88 belong to the Axtell fine
sandy loam within Locus A on top of the
upland and side slope, while soils located
further down slope (Locus B) belong to the
Wilson silty clay loam series. Both soil
profiles reveal a shallow Ap/E horizon
overlying a B horizon approximately 20
centimeters below ground surface.

Within the current proposed work space, Site
41FA88 has little research potential and is
unlikely to contain further temporal or cultural
functional information that would contribute
to the understanding of local or regional
prehistory. The portion of Site 41FA88
located within the proposed workspace and
300-foot-wide
survey
corridor
is
recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for listing in
the NRHP and no further work is
recommended. That portion of the site located
outside of the 300-foot-wide survey corridor
remains UNEVALUATED for listing in the
NRHP.

Site 41FA88 is a large prehistoric open
habitation of undetermined age and cultural
affiliation. Although artifacts were recovered
fairly deep within the soil profile within a
single subsurface test, the artifact assemblage
is limited in number and range of artifact
types. A total of 174 pieces of debitage, 1
late-stage biface, 2 core fragments, and 5
possible pieces of fire cracked rock have been
encountered. No diagnostic tools, ceramics or
archaeological features have been identified.

SITE 41RT562 (RT22-FS1)
Site 41RT562 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of
undetermined cultural affiliation within
Segment RT22 approximately 85m south and
2,220m west of the intersection of FM 2549
and CR 1 (Appendix D: Sheet: 61: Figure 44).

Approximately 46 percent of the artifacts were
recovered from Locus A on top of the upland

that no further investigations of the site be
required.

The site is located on an upland side slope
near Suggs Branch Creek approximately 3.0
miles east of Hearne, Texas. Site 41RT562
is ovoid in shape and measured
approximately 40 x 10 m in area (Figure
44). At the time of survey, the site was
located within a cattle pasture.
Site 41RT562 was first identified during
shovel test excavation of the project survey
corridor. A subsequent pedestrian surface
survey was conducted over the site area with
transects spaced at 2.5-meter intervals.
Ground surface visibility ranged from 0 to
10 percent. Three artifacts were identified
on the surface of the site, including 2
debitage and 1 late-stage biface fragment.

Thirty-eight subsurface tests were then
advanced over the landform within the
current proposed survey corridor to
delineate the site (Figure 47). A typical
shovel test at Site 41RT564 was excavated
to a depth of 100 cmbs and exhibited two
stratums in profile. Stratum I consisted of
an E horizon consisting of a pale brown
(10YR 6/3) sandy loam from 0 to 80 cmbs.
Stratum II consisted of a second layer of the
E horizon with pale brown (10YR 6/3) to
pink (7.5YR7/4) sand, ranging in depth from
80 to 140 cmbs.

were recovered fairly deep within the soil
profile, the artifact assemblage is limited in
number and range of artifact types. No
diagnostic tools, ceramics or archaeological
features were identified. Approximately 35
percent of the assemblage was derived from
80 to 100 cmbs. Stratums I and II appear to
be highly mixed by a combination of
bioturbation and artifacts translocating
through sandy soils over time. The site has
also experienced disturbances associated
with previous pipeline development. The
site likely extends to the west.

Of the 38 shovel tests excavated, 22 were
positive for cultural material.
Cultural
deposits at the site extended as much as 100
cmbs, therefore one backhoe trench was
excavated to provide more data on the soil
profile and location of cultural deposits.

Site 41RT564 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or
cultural functional information that would
contribute to the understanding of local or
regional prehistory. The portion of Site
41RT564 located within the proposed
workspace and 300-foot-wide survey
corridor is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE
for listing in the NRHP and no further work
is recommended. That portion of the site
located outside of the 300-foot-wide survey
corridor remains UNEVALUATED for
listing in the NRHP.

Trench 1 was approximately 10 meters in
length and was excavated as deep as 180
cmbs. One column sample shovel test was
excavated within the profile of Trench 1.
Artifacts recovered included 57 pieces of
debitage (Table 9). Artifacts recovered from
Stratum I (0 to 80 cmbs) included 33 pieces
of debitage.
Artifacts recovered from
Stratum II (80 to 140 cmbs) included 24
pieces of debitage.

SITE 41RT565 (RT29-FS1)

proposed survey corridor to delineate the
site (Figure 49). Shovel tests at Site
41RT565 were excavated to a depth of
approximately 50 cmbs. Most subsurface
tests encountered two stratums. Stratum I
consisted of a disturbed plowzone (Ap
horizon) with a strong brown (7.5YR 5/8)
sandy loam from 0 to 30 cmbs. Stratum II
consisted of a B horizon of red (5YR 5/8)
sandy clay extending from 30 to 50 cmbs.

Site 41RT565 is ovoid in shape and
measured approximately 90 x 30 m in area
(Figure 49). At the time of survey, the site
was located within an area of pasture and is
bisected by a several gravel roads.

Eight of the 19 shovel tests were positive for
cultural material with artifacts being
recovered from 0 to 50 centimeters below
surface. Artifacts recovered include a total
of 115 items including; 24 pieces of
debitage, 37 fragments of historic glass, 16
historic ceramics (whiteware), 11 nail
fragments, 9 fragments of brick, 1 button, 1
horseshoe,
and
16
fragments
of
miscellaneous metal.
All artifacts were recovered from either
disturbed fill deposits or within a disturbed
Ap horizon. Approximately 60 percent of
the artifacts recovered from the site were
derived from a single subsurface test (OT-8)
within disturbed fill deposits. Most likely
this is a result of disturbances associated
with the development of two access roads
that bisect the site.

View East.

Historic artifacts appear to be concentrated
near the top of the landform located on the
west side of the site (i.e., Shovel Test OT5,
OT6, and OT8). Prehistoric artifacts were
recovered within all positive subsurface tests
but appear to be concentrated on the east
side of the site within Shovel Tests B5, OT1,
OT7, and OT9.

Archaeological investigations of Site
41RT565 consisted of a pedestrian surface
survey and subsurface testing. The site was
first identified during shovel test excavation
of the project survey corridor. A subsequent
pedestrian surface survey was conducted
over the site area with transects spaced at 5meter intervals. Ground surface visibility
ranged between 10 and 30 percent. No
artifacts or features were observed on the
surface of the site.

historic aerials within the current project
survey corridor. Examination of the USGS
Dunn Creek, Texas topographic map dating
to 1963 depicts a former structure
approximately 70 meters north of the limits
of the proposed project survey corridor. The
historic artifacts may be associated with that
former structure and have been displaced to
this location during the construction of
several modern gravel roads that bisect the
site. The prehistoric component at the site
consisted of a small scatter of debitage that
was restricted to the disturbed plowzone/Ap
horizon. No diagnostic tools, ceramics or
archaeological features were identified.

The site was first identified during shovel
test excavation of the project survey
corridor. A subsequent pedestrian surface
survey was conducted over the site area with
transects spaced at 5-meter intervals.
Ground surface visibility ranged between 10
and 30 percent. No artifacts or features (i.e.,
depressions suggestive of buried privies or
cisterns) were observed on the surface of the
site.

Site 41RT565 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or
cultural functional information that would
contribute to the understanding of local or
regional history or prehistory.
Site
41RT565 will not be affected as currently
designed. The site is recommended NOT
ELIGIBLE for listing in the NRHP. SWCA
recommends no further work.

Thirteen subsurface tests were advanced in a
cruciform pattern within the current
proposed survey corridor at 10-meter
intervals to delineate the site (Figure 49).
Shovel tests at Site 41RT566 were
excavated to a depth of approximately 100
cmbs. Most subsurface tests encountered
two stratums. Stratum I consisted of a
disturbed plowzone (Ap horizon) with a
weak red (2.5YR 4/2) sandy loam from 0 to
20 cmbs. Stratum II consisted of a disturbed
layer of fill (2.5YR 5/4) sand extending
from 20 to 100 cmbs.

SITE 41RT566 (RT8-FS1)
Site 41RT566 is the location of a former
historic Euro-American structure/residence
dating to the early to mid-twentieth century.
The site was identified within Segment RT8,
approximately 1,555m east and 245m north
of the intersection of Highway 6 and Jenkins
Road (Appendix D: Sheet 57). The site is
located on an upland landform overlooking
an unnamed tributary of Walnut Creek to the
north and west approximately 5.5 miles
north of Calvert, Texas.

Seven of the 13 shovel tests were positive
for cultural material with artifacts being
recovered from 0 to 100 centimeters below
surface. Prior to the completion of the
shovel tests at the site, the landowner visited
and informed SWCA employees that this
was the former location of a residence
dating to the 1920s and 1930s that was
subsequently destroyed and burned in place
around 1935.
A total of 103 items were recovered from
shovel test excavation including: 38
fragments of historic glass, 8 historic

wire nail and 2 cut nail fragments),
11fragments of brick, 16 fragments of
miscellaneous metal, 9 fragments of modern
animal bone, and 1 shotgun shell casing. All
artifacts were recovered from either
disturbed fill deposits or a disturbed
plowzone (Ap horizon). Approximately 65
percent of the artifacts (N=67) recovered
from the site were derived from a single
subsurface test (OT-3).

Site 41RT567 is ovoid in shape and
measures approximately 20 x 10 meters
(Figure 51). At the time of survey, the site
was located within a cattle pasture.
Site 41RT567 was first identified during
shovel test excavation of the project survey
corridor. A subsequent pedestrian surface
survey was conducted over the site area with
transects spaced at 10 meter intervals.
Ground surface visibility ranged from 0 to
20 percent. No artifacts were identified on
the surface of the site.

Site 41RT566 is the location of a former
historic Euro-American structure/residence
dating to the early to mid-twentieth century.
All artifacts recovered were derived from
disturbed fill deposits. Informant interview
of the current landowner indicated that the
site is the location of a former
structure/residence dating to the 1920s and
1930s that was subsequently destroyed
around 1935. No intact subsurface features
(i.e., foundation, privy or cellar deposits)
were encountered within the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor.

Twelve subsurface tests were then advanced
over the landform within the current
proposed survey corridor to delineate the
site (Figure 51). A typical shovel test at Site
41RT567 was excavated to a depth of 100
cmbs) and exhibited three stratums in
profile. Stratum I consisted of an E horizon
consisting of a reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4)
sand from 0 to 30 cmbs. Stratum II
consisted of a second layer of the E horizon
with red (2.5YR 4/6) sand, ranging in depth
from 30 to 60 cmbs. Stratum III consisted of
a B horizon with red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay
ranging in depth from 60 to 100 cmbs.

That portion of site 41RT566 within the
300-foot-wide survey corridor has little
research potential and is unlikely to contain
further temporal or cultural functional
information that would contribute to the
understanding of local or regional history.
The portion of Site 41RT566 located within
the proposed workspace and 300-foot-wide

Two of the 12 shovel tests were positive for
cultural material. Artifacts recovered
included 2 pieces of debitage from 0 to 30
cmbs.
Site 41RT567 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of
undetermined age and cultural affiliation.
The site has very limited archaeological
deposits and poor integrity. No diagnostic
tools, ceramics or archaeological features
were identified.

SITE 41RT568 (RT24-FS1)
Site 41RT568 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of
undetermined cultural affiliation within
Segment RT24, approximately 460m north
and 1,147m west of the intersection of FM
2549 and 5 Points Road (Appendix D:
Sheet: 61). The site is located on an upland
side slope near Pine Oak Creek
approximately 3.0 miles east of Hearne,
Texas.

Site 41RT568 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or
cultural functional information that would
contribute to the understanding of local or
regional prehistory. Site 41RT568 will be
avoided as currently designed. The site is
recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for listing in
the NRHP. SWCA recommends that no
further work be required.

Site 41RT568 is circular in shape and
measured approximately 5 x 5 meters
(Figure 52). At the time of survey, the site
was located within trees.

SITE 41RT569 (RT26-FS1)
Site 41RT569 is a prehistoric artifact scatter
of a Ceramic or Late Prehistoric period
occupation within Segment RT26. The site
was identified approximately 1,635m east
and 800m south of the intersection of Jack
Rabbit Lane and Oakridge Drive (Appendix
D: Sheet 62). The site is on an upland
terrace near Spring Creek approximately 7
miles southeast of Hearne, Texas.

Site 41RT568 was first identified during
shovel test excavation of the project survey
corridor. A subsequent pedestrian surface
survey was conducted over the site area with
transects spaced at 2.5-meter intervals.
Ground surface visibility ranged from 0 to
10 percent. No artifacts or features were
observed on the surface of the site.
Nine subsurface tests were then advanced
over the landform within the current
proposed survey corridor to delineate the
site (Figure 52). A typical shovel test
excavated at Site 41RT568 was excavated to
a depth of 30cmbs and exhibited two
stratums in profile. Stratum I consisted of
an Ap horizon consisting of reddish yellow

Twenty-six subsurface tests were then
advanced over the landform within the
current proposed survey corridor to
delineate the site (Figure 53). A typical
shovel test at Site 41RT569 was excavated
to a depth of 100 cmbs and exhibited two
stratums in profile. Stratum I consisted of an
E horizon consisting of a dark yellowish
brown (10YR 3/4) sand from 0 to 80 cmbs.
Stratum II consisted of a second layer of the
E horizon with brown (7.5YR 5/4) sand,
ranging in depth from 80 to 130 cmbs.

Site 41RT569 is a prehistoric artifact scatter
with a Ceramic or Late Prehistoric period
occupation based on the recovery of an
incised ceramic body sherd.
Although
artifacts were recovered fairly deep within
the soil profile, the artifact assemblage is
limited in number and range of artifact
types. No diagnostic tools or archaeological
features were identified. Stratums I and II
appear to be highly mixed by a combination
of bioturbation and artifacts translocating
through sandy soils over time. The site has
also experienced disturbances associated
with previous pipeline development.

Fourteen of the 29 shovel tests were positive
for cultural material (Table 10). As cultural
deposits at the site extended as deep as 120
cmbgs, two backhoe trenches were
excavated at the site to provide more data on
the soil profile and location of cultural
deposits. Trenches 1 and 2 were both
approximately 6 meters in length and were
excavated as deep as 190 centimeters below
ground surface. One column sample shovel
test was excavated within the profile of each
trench.

Site 41RT569 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or

Since the trenches were excavated at the site
to a greater depth than the shovel tests an
additional two stratums were encountered.
Stratum III consisted of a B horizon with
yellowish brown (5YR 4/6) sandy clay from
130 to 190 cmbs. Stratum IV consisted of a
second stratified layer of the B horizon
consisting of yellowish red (5YR 4/4) sandy
clay that extended as deep as 190 cmbs.
A total of 90 pieces of debitage and 6
ceramic body sherds were recovered at the
site. A photograph of the single decorated
ceramic sherd is provided in Figure 54.

Twenty-six subsurface tests were advanced
in a grid pattern within the current proposed
survey corridor to delineate the site (Figure
56). A typical shovel test at Site 41BZ167
was excavated to a depth of 100 cmbs and
exhibited three stratums in profile. Stratum
I consisted of an A/E horizon with a brown
(10YR 5/3) to light yellowish brown (10YR

SITE 41BZ168 (BZ16-FS1)
Site 41BZ168 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of
undetermined cultural affiliation located
within Segment BZ16. The site is on a
westward-trending upland ridge and side
slope overlooking an intermittent drainage
that flows to the Navasota River
approximately 6.25 miles southeast of
Kurten, Texas. The site is approximately
1,190 m south and 850 m east of the
intersection of Cobb Road and Trussel Road
(aka Nubin Road) (Appendix D: Sheet 67).

Five of the 19 shovel tests were positive for
cultural material with artifacts being
recovered from as deep as 120 centimeters
below surface. Due to cultural deposits at
the site extending as deep as 120 cmbgs, two
backhoe trenches were excavated at the site
to provide more data on the soil profile and
location of cultural deposits.

Site 41GM168 is irregular in shape and
measures approximately 90 x 40 meters
(Figure 57). At the time of survey, the site
was located primarily within an area of

Site 41BZ169 is ovoid in shape and
measured approximately 30 x 30 meters
(Figure 58). At the time of survey, the site
was located within an area of pasture.
Archaeological investigation of Site
41BZ169 consisted of a pedestrian surface
survey and subsurface testing.
The
pedestrian surface survey was conducted
over the site area with transects spaced at 10
meter intervals. Ground surface visibility
ranged from 0 to 5 percent. No artifacts or
features were observed on the surface of the
site.

Site 41BZ168 is a small lithic scatter of
undetermined age and cultural affiliation.
Although artifacts were recovered fairly
deep within the soil profile, the artifact
assemblage is limited in number and range
of artifact types. No diagnostic tools,
ceramics, or archaeological features were
identified. There was a significant amount
of bioturbation at the site that extended as
much as 110 centimeters below ground
surface.

Thirteen subsurface tests were placed on the
upland side slope in a cruciform pattern
within the current proposed survey corridor
to delineate the site (Figure 58). A typical
shovel test at Site 41BZ169 was excavated
to a depth of 100 cmbs and exhibited two
stratums in profile. Stratum I consisted of
stratified layers within the E horizon
consisting of reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3)

Site 41BZ168 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or
cultural functional information that would
contribute to the understanding of local or
regional prehistory. Site 41BZ168 will be
avoided as currently designed. The portion

consisted of a strong brown (2.5YR 5/6)
sandy clay that extended as much as 100

SITE 41GM5 (GM16-FS1)
Site 41GM5 was originally recorded in
December of 1980 by H. Shafer of the
University of Texas in association with the
Barnum Place Survey. It was identified as
the remains of an historic ninetieth century
homestead (Barnum Farmstead) associated
with a Stephen F. Austin colony.

Five of the 13 shovel tests were positive for
cultural material with artifacts being
recovered from as deep as 80 centimeters
below surface.
Table 13 provides an
accounting of the artifacts recovered by
depth/stratum.

The site is on an upland ridge and side slope
approximately 2,745 meters east and 810
meters north of the intersection of FM 149
and FM 2562 approximately 4.0 miles
southeast of Roans Prairie (Appendix D:
Sheet 74). Overview photographs of the site
are provided in Figures 59 and 60.

Further background research was conducted
on the farmstead during the current
undertaking by Architectural Historian Anna
Mod. The following describes the results of
her research.

Site 41GM5 was recorded by H. Shafer on
14 December 1980. This record contains the
most information about the property,
building and the ruins at that time. At that
time, the property was given the name
“Barnum Place Survey” presumably after
Mr. and Mrs. Dale Barnum, the owners at
that time. A review of the deeds shows that
Margaret Cecil Johnson Barnum owned the
property until 1988 when she sold it to
Rebecca and Cort Norwood (DRGC, Vol.
627, p. 198). Shafer describes the farmstead
as a “historic 19th century homestead” with
“cultural affiliation with the Stephen F.
Austin colony.” The site form goes on to
say that the house was well preserved and
was currently being restored by the owner,
noted to be a descendent of the original
builder. In addition to the house, there were
ruins of a syrup mill, slave quarters, and a
community school house but none of these
buildings were standing in 1980. The house
is described as having “a central breeze way
and had 4 chimneys; only two of the
chimneys are left and both are in a bad state
of repair.” At the time of the 1980 survey,
the property was owned by Mr. And Mrs.
Dale Barnum of 114 S. Woodsway, Conroe,
Texas and was threatened by a Gulf States
Utility Power Line. Shafer mentioned that
the owners were trying to get the site
nominated to the National Register of
Historic Places. SWCA contacted the
Historic Programs Division of the Texas
Historical Commission to see if there were
any additional records or photographs of the
property. Due to the quick turnaround of this
report, there was not adequate time for THC
to respond to the request.

Site 41GM5 is a ruin of a wood framed
house. The debris pile includes milled wood,
asphalt roofing shingles, fired bricks and
standing, coursed, rough cut limestone
chimney. Review of the History of Grimes
County: Land of Heritage and Progress and
the Early History of Grimes County, reveal
that the property is within the quarter league
Claiborne Garrett grant from 3 December
1832. Claiborne Garrett was one of Stephen
F. Austin’s original sixty-four colonists that
received land grants in what is now Grimes
County (Figures 61 and 62).
Unfortunately, not much is known about
Claiborne Garrett other than the 3 December
1832 date of his quarter league patent.
Records at the Texas General Land Office
note that he was unmarried. He is not
mentioned in the Austin papers (Blair, 62).
The 1840 federal census includes 22 persons
with the surname Garrett with none residing
in Texas (ancestry.com). By the 1860
census, four different Garrett families appear
Robertson, Refutio and Kauffman Counties
but none in Grimes. The T. J. Garrett family
first appears in the 1880 census in Anderson,
Grimes County. T. J. is listed as a farmer
and born in Georgia. His wife, Mary, was
born in Alabama. Four of the couple’s
youngest six children (ages 6 to 5 months)
were born in Texas; the two older children
(10 and 8 years old) were both born in
Alabama indicating the family did not come
to Texas until between 1872 and 1874.
There are no other Garretts in Grimes
County in the 1880 census (ancestry.com).
A similar search of ancestry.com was
conducted for the surnames Barnum and
Johnson with similar results.

Based on Shafer’s description above, the
house is assumed to be a dogtrot given the
description of a central “breezeway.” On site
measurement of the four corners of the
collapsed house in 2012 as well as site

meters (Figure 63).

observation show it was a 12x12 meter
wood framed building on a pier and beam
foundation with milled wooden lap siding.
The roofing material had been replaced over
time; there are asphalt roofing shingles in
the debris pile.

Since the original recordation, the house site
has degraded and all that remains is the
foundation and portions of the former
chimneys (Figure 64). The house was
oriented N-S and E-W and measured
approximately 12x12-meters in size. One
limestone chimney was identified along the
west wall of the structure and two brick
chimneys were identified on the east wall of
the structure. Many newer appliances were
scattered about at the location of the
structure. The current 300-foot-wide survey
corridor intersects the northeast corner of the
former structure location. A cistern/well
was located adjacent to the northeast corner
of the former house (Figure 63, 65, and 66).

Vernacular rural dogtrot houses in Texas
evolved from houses constructed of logs that
were constructed in Central and East Texas
prior to the arrival of sawmills. The square
floor plan of this house is an anomaly when
compared to the typical rectangular plan
dogtrot. SWCA reviewed several books of
Texas buildings (Alexander, Bracken,
Echols, Greene, Jordan and Robinson).
Although there were some examples from
Grimes County, most were high style
residential examples in towns or cities. A
review of Jordan’s book, Texas Log
Buildings, shows that the exterior placement
and material (limestone) of the chimney are
found in early rural vernacular Texas houses
from the 1840s and later.

Thirteen shovel tests were excavated within
the survey corridor. No artifacts were
recovered within these subsurface tests. A
typical shovel test at Site 41GM5 was
excavated to a depth of 50 cmbs and
exhibited two stratums in profile. Stratum I
consisted of brown (7.5YR 4/4) to very pale
brown (10YR 7/4) sandy clay from the
surface to approximately 10 cmbs. Stratum
II extended from the termination of Stratum
I to approximately 50 cmbs and consisted of
yellowish red (10YR 5/6) clay loam, sandy
clay loam to clay.

SWCA investigation of Site 41GM5
consisted of a pedestrian surface survey,
shovel testing, and metal detecting within
the 300-foot-wide survey corridor.
The site is located within an actively
cultivated field and tall grass pasture. The
cultivated field provided excellent surface
visibility, ranging from 80 to 100 percent,
while surface visibility in the tall grass
pasture was poor, ranging from 0 to 10
percent.

SWCA conducted a metal detector survey
within the 90-foot-wide project workspace
through site 41GM5. At total of 29 metal
artifacts were recovered during the metal
detector survey. Three cupreous artifacts
were found including a decorative makeup
compact (Figures 67 and 68), one tube or
container, and one unknown object (see
Figures in Appendix I). A total of 26 ferrous
artifacts were recovered from within the
project workspace. These objects included a

Pedestrian survey revisited the former house
site and documented the presence of three of
the four chimneys noted in the original
recordation. No other structures noted on the
original site form were identified within the
current survey corridor.
One modern
equipment building was still standing
approximately 70 meters southwest of the

All of the metal artifacts were recovered
from the surface to eight inches in depth.
Thirteen shovel tests were excavated within
the 300 foot-wide survey corridor in the
vicinity of 41GM5 (Figure 63).
No
subsurface artifacts were recovered.
Given the 100 percent metal detection
survey within the proposed workspace and
relatively few artifacts being found the
portion of Site 41GM5 to be affected has
little potential to provide further temporal or
cultural functional information that would
contribute to the understanding of activities
that took place at the Barnum farmstead.
The portion of Site 41GM5 located within
the proposed workspace is recommended
NOT ELIGIBLE for listing in the NRHP
and no further work is recommended. That
portion of the site located outside of the
proposed workspace remains unevaluated
for listing in the NRHP.

The well and one corner of the remains of
the house are located within the 300-footwide survey corridor. The well is located 65
feet west of the proposed workspace and
will not be impacted by the current project.
Previous disturbances in the vicinity of the
site include an overhead powerline to the
east and a previous pipeline survey corridor.

sherds (that refit), and 1 mano fragment
(Table 14). Due to cultural deposits at the
site extending as much as 100 cmbgs, a
single backhoe trench was excavated to
provide more data on the soil profile and
location of cultural deposits.
Trench 1 was approximately 10 meters in
length and was excavated as deep as 120
centimeters below ground surface. No
artifacts were identified in the shovel test
excavated into the side of the Trench 1
profile. No cultural features were identified
in the trench.

Site 41GM419 is ovoid in shape and
measured approximately 30 x 35 meters
(Figure 74).
At the time of survey,
approximately 70 percent of the site was
located within a field of pasture with cattle
grazing, while the remaining 30 percent of
the site was within a cultivated hayfield.

Archaeological investigation of Site
41GM419 consisted of a pedestrian surface
survey and subsurface testing.
The
pedestrian surface survey was conducted
over the site area with transects spaced at
10-meter intervals.
Ground surface
visibility ranged from 20 to 30 percent.

Artifacts were fairly evenly distributed
within the soil column at the site.
Photographs of some of the representative
artifacts are provided in Figures 75 through
77. Artifacts recovered from Stratum I (0 to
80 cmbs) include 14 pieces of debitage, two
ceramic body sherds, and one mano.
Artifacts recovered from Stratum II (80 to
120 cmbs) include 6 pieces of debitage.

Fifteen subsurface tests were advanced
within a cruciform pattern within the current
proposed survey corridor to delineate the
site (Figure 74). A typical shovel test at Site
41GM419 was excavated to a depth of 100
cmbs and exhibited two stratums in profile.
Stratum I consisted of an E horizon
consisting of a pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy
loam from 0 to 80 cmbs. Stratum II
consisted of a B horizon with grayish brown
(10YR 5/2) to pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy
loam to sand, ranging in depth from 80 to
120 cmbs.

Site 41GM419 represents a small open
habitation site of a Ceramic or Late
Prehistoric period occupation based on the
recovery of two ceramic body sherds.
Overall, the artifact assemblage is limited in
number and range of artifact types. No

Seven of the 15 shovel tests were positive
for cultural material. Artifacts recovered

other diagnostic tools or archaeological
features were identified. The site has been
disturbed by previous pipeline construction
and artifacts were only recovered within the
existing disturbed right-of-way of the
pipeline alignment.
Site 41GM419 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or
cultural functional information that would
contribute to the understanding of local or
regional prehistory. The portion of Site
41GM419 located within the proposed
workspace and 300-foot-wide survey
corridor is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE
for listing in the NRHP and no further work
is recommended within the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor.

SITE 41GM420 (GM1-FS2)
Site 41GM420 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
of undetermined cultural affiliation located
within Segment GM1. The site is on an
upland terrace and side slope overlooking an
intermittent tributary of the Navasota River
to the west approximately 8.5 miles
southeast of Kurten, Texas. The site is
approximately 1,363m south and 10m west
of the intersection of County Road 162 and
County Road 103 (Appendix D: Sheet 68).

Site 41GM420 was initially identified
during Phase I subsurface investigation
within the tracts. Subsequently, a pedestrian
surface survey was conducted over the site
area with transects spaced at 5-meter
intervals. Ground surface visibility ranged
from 20 to 30 percent. No artifacts or
features were observed on the surface of the
site.

Artifacts recovered included 23 pieces of
debitage and 1 modern glass fragment.
Table 15 provides an accounting of the
artifacts recovered by depth/stratum.
Artifacts recovered from Stratum I (0 to 60
cmbs) include 11 pieces of debitage and the
modern piece of glass. Artifacts recovered
from Stratum II (60 to 120 cmbs) include 12
pieces of debitage.

Seventeen subsurface tests were advanced
within the current proposed survey corridor
to delineate the site (Figure 78). A typical
shovel test at Site 41GM420 was excavated
to a depth of 100 cmbs and exhibited two
stratums in profile. An additional Stratum III
was observed from the trench. Stratum I
consisted of an E horizon with a brown
(7.5YR 5/3) sandy loam from 0 to 60 cmbs.
Stratum II consisted of another stratified
layer within the E horizon with brown
(7.5YR 5/4) to light brown (7.5YR 6/4) to
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam to
sand ranging in depth from 60 to 180 cmbs.
Stratum III consisted of the B horizon a pale
brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay that extended
between 180 to 200 cmbs.

Site 41GM420 is a small lithic scatter of
undetermined age and cultural affiliation.
Although artifacts were recovered fairly
deep within the soil profile, the artifact
assemblage is limited in number and range
of artifact types. No diagnostic tools or
archaeological features were identified.

Five of the 17 shovel tests were positive for
cultural material with artifacts being
recovered from as deep as 120 centimeters
below surface. Due to cultural deposits at
the site extending as much as 120 cmbgs, a
single backhoe trench (Trench 1) was
excavated at the site to provide more data on
the soil profile and location of cultural
deposits.

Site 41GM420 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or
cultural functional information that would
contribute to the understanding of local or
regional prehistory. The portion of Site
41GM420 located within the proposed
workspace and 300-foot-wide survey
corridor is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE
for listing in the NRHP and no further work
is recommended within the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor. That portion of the site
located outside of the 300-foot-wide survey
corridor remains unevaluated for listing in
the NRHP.

Trench 1 was approximately 6 meters in
length and was excavated as much as 210
centimeters below ground surface. Trench 1
was excavated in the vicinity of a shovel test
that had a questionable piece of fire-cracked
rock. One column sample shovel test was
excavated within Trench 1. No features
were identified within Trench 1

100

as deep as 100 cmbs. Artifacts recovered
included 21 pieces of debitage, 1 ceramic
sherd, and 1 Catahoula-like projectile point
(Table 16). Artifacts were fairly evenly
distributed within the soil column at the site.
Photographs of some of the representative
artifacts recovered are provided in Figures
81 and 82. Artifacts recovered from Stratum
I (0 to 80 cmbs) include 22 pieces of
debitage, one Catahoula-like projectile
point, and one ceramic body sherd.
Artifacts recovered from Stratum II (80 to
120 cmbs) include 1 piece of debitage.

SITE 41GM421 (GM8-FS1)
Site 41GM421 is a prehistoric open
habitation of a Ceramic or Late Prehistoric
period occupation located within Segment
GM8. The site is on an upland side slope
overlooking a small intermittent tributary of
Sulphur Creek to the south approximately
3.5 miles northwest of Roans Prairie,
Grimes County, Texas. The site is located
approximately 500 m west and 1,850 m
north of the intersection of Highway 30 and
Hazy Hollow Lane (Appendix D: Sheet
71a).

Site 41GM421 represents a small open
habitation site of a Ceramic or Late
Prehistoric period occupation based on the
recovery of one Catahoula-like projectile
point and one ceramic body sherd. Artifacts
were recovered in deposits as deep as 100
cmbs.
No other diagnostic tools or
archaeological features were identified. The
site has been previously disturbed by
pipeline construction with artifacts located
on either side of the existing pipeline rightway.

Site 41GM421 is ovoid in shape and
measures approximately 150 x 90 meters
(Figure 79). At the time of survey, the site
was located within timber. An overview
photograph of the field conditions at the
time of investigations is provided in Figure
80.
Archaeological investigation of Site
41GM421 consisted of a pedestrian surface
survey and subsurface testing.
The
pedestrian surface survey was conducted
over the site area with transects spaced at
10-meter intervals.
Ground surface
visibility ranged from 0 to 15 percent.

Subsequent to site delineation with shovel
tests the proposed pipeline survey corridor
was rerouted. No further investigation at the
site was conducted due to the reroute and the
site will be avoided by the current
undertaking.
Site 41GM421 remains
UNEVALUATED for listing in the NRHP.
If project plans change and the site cannot
be avoided additional investigation of the
site will be required.

Twenty-two subsurface tests were advanced
over the landform within the current
proposed survey corridor to delineate the
site (Figure 79). A typical shovel test at Site
41GM421 was excavated to a depth of 100
cmbs and exhibited two stratums in profile.
Stratum I consisted of an E horizon
consisting of a pale red (2.5YR 6/2) to weak
red (2.5YR 5/2) sand from 0 to 80 cmbs.
Stratum II consisted of a B horizon with
grayish brown (2.5YR 5/2) to light red
(2.5YR 6/6) sandy clay, ranging in depth
from 80 to 100 cmbs.
Ten of the 22 shovel tests were positive for
cultural material. Artifacts were recovered

cattle grazing

brown (10YR 6/2) sandy clay that extended
between 40 to 100 cmbs.

Archaeological investigation of Site
41GM422 consisted of a pedestrian surface
survey and subsurface testing.
The
pedestrian surface survey was conducted
over the site area with transects spaced at
10-meter intervals.
Ground surface
visibility ranged from 20 to 30 percent.
Two pieces of debitage were noted on the
surface of the site, while excavating Shovel
Test C13. No other artifacts or features
were observed on the surface of the site.

Artifacts recovered from shovel test
excavation included nine pieces of debitage.
Artifacts recovered from Stratum I (0 to 40
cmbs) include 4 pieces of debitage. Artifacts
recovered from Stratum III (40 to 100 cmbs)
include 5 pieces of debitage.
Site 41GM422 is a small lithic scatter of
undetermined age and cultural affiliation.
Although artifacts were recovered fairly
deep within the soil profile, the artifact
assemblage is limited in number and range
of artifact types. No diagnostic tools or
archaeological features were identified.

Twelve subsurface tests were placed in a
cruciform pattern within the current
proposed survey corridor to delineate the
site (Figure 84).

Site 41GM422 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or
cultural functional information that would
contribute to the understanding of local or
regional prehistory. The site will not be
affected as currently designed. The portion
of Site 41GM422 located within the 300foot-wide survey corridor is recommended
NOT ELIGIBLE for listing in the NRHP
and no further work is recommended. That
portion of the site located outside of the 300foot-wide
survey
corridor
remains
unevaluated for listing in the NRHP.

Four of the 12 shovel tests were positive for
cultural material. Material was recovered
from the surface to as deep as 100 cmbs.
Due to cultural deposits at the site extending
as deep as 100 cmbs, a single backhoe
trench was excavated at the site to provide
more data on the soil profile and location of
cultural deposits.
Trench 1 was approximately five meters in
length and was excavated as much as 100
centimeters below ground surface. No
artifacts were identified in the shovel test
excavated into the side of the Trench 1
profile.

SITE 41GM423 (GM14-FS1)
Site 41GM423 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
of undetermined cultural affiliation in
Segment GM14 The site is on an upland
ridge that trends to the south and side slope
overlooking Garrett’s Creek to the west
approximately 2.5 miles southeast of Roans
Prairie, Texas. The site is approximately
1,150 m west and 10 m south of the
intersection of FM 2562 and CR 217
(Appendix G: Sheet 73). An overview
photograph of the field conditions at the
time of investigations is provided in Figure
85.

Shovel tests and Trench 1 at 41GM422 were
excavated to a depth of approximately 100
cmbs and exhibited three stratums in profile.
Stratum I consisted of a disturbed plowzone
(Ap horizon) consisting of a dark yellowish
brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam from 0 to 20
cmbs. Stratum II consisted of an E horizon
of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand
extending from 20 to 40 cmbs. Stratum III
consisted of a Bt horizon of light yellowish

105

strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy clay that
extended between 100 and 140 cmbs.
A total of 25 of the 81 shovel tests were
positive for cultural material with artifacts
being recovered from as deep as 140
centimeters below surface. Due to cultural
deposits at the site extending as deep as 140
cmbs, two backhoe trenches were excavated
to provide more data on the soil profile and
location of cultural deposits.
Trench 1 was approximately 6.1 meters in
length and was excavated as deep as 144
centimeters below ground surface. Trench 2
was approximately 6 meters in length and
was excavated as deep as 150 centimeters
below ground surface. One column sample
shovel test was excavated within the profile
of each backhoe trench. No cultural features
were identified within the two trenches
excavated.

Figure 85. Overview of Site 41GM423 (GM14FS1), View Northeast.

Site 41GM423 is ovoid in shape and is
located on both sides of the current
centerline of the pipeline measuring 160 x
140 meters (Figure 86). At the time of
survey, the site was located within pasture
with small stands of trees.
Archaeological investigation of Site
41GM423 consisted of a pedestrian surface
survey and subsurface testing.
The
pedestrian surface survey was conducted
over the site area with transects spaced at 5meter intervals. Ground surface visibility
ranged from 0 to 10 percent. No artifacts or
features were observed on the surface of the
site.

Artifacts recovered included 176 pieces of
debitage. Table 17 provides an accounting

Kurten, Texas. The site is approximately
440m west and 1,200m south of the
intersection of CR 162 and CR 103
(Appendix D: Sheet 68). An overview
photograph of the field conditions at the
time of investigations is provided in Figure

Site 41GM423 is a widely dispersed lithic
scatter of undetermined age and cultural
affiliation.
Although artifacts were
recovered fairly deep within the soil profile,
the artifact assemblage is limited in number
and range of artifact types. No diagnostic
tools, ceramics, or archaeological features
were identified.
Approximately 53 percent of the artifacts
were recovered from Stratum I, 32 percent
from Stratum II, and 15 percent from
Stratum III. There were no large increases
in artifact density with depth which would
suggest a living surface or stratification of
archaeological deposits. Stratum II and III
appear to highly mixed by a combination of
bioturbation and artifacts translocating
through the sandy soils over time. The site
has also been disturbed by previous pipeline
development. The site extends outside (east
and west) of the 300-foot-wide survey
corridor.

Figure 87. Overview of Site 41GM424 (GM1FS1), View Northwest

Site 41GM424 is ovoid in shape and
measures approximately 90 x 100 meters
(Figure 88). At the time of survey, the site
was located within a field of pasture located
on either side of a gravel road with cattle
grazing.

Site 41GM423 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or
cultural functional information that would

A total of 21 of the 49 shovel tests were
positive for cultural material with artifacts
being recovered from as deep as 120
centimeters below surface. Due to cultural
deposits at the site extending as deep as 120
cmbs, a single backhoe trench (Trench 1)
was excavated at the site to provide more
data on the soil profile and location of
cultural deposits.
Trench 1 was approximately 8 meters in
length and was excavated as much as 146
centimeters below ground surface. One
column sample shovel test was excavated
within Trench 1. The location of the trench
was based on artifact density and presence
of possible burned earth in nearby shovel
tests.

Headstone #2 is a small metal marker for
Eula May Peteete (Figure 92). This burial
did not include a footstone. A photograph
of Eula May Peteete’s headstone is provided
in Figure 89. Eula May Peteete died at the
age of 18.

Cemetery

Site 41GM425, the Peteete Cemetery,
located within Segment GM8RR, includes
burials of as many as five individuals. The
gravestones are located on an upland terrace
landform on the south side of a unnamed
gravel road approximately 15,000 feet north
of the intersection of State Highway 30 and
Rambling Lane (Appendix D: Sheet 71).

Headstone #3 is the stone marker for J.M.
Peteete. This burial included a footstone. A
photograph of the J.M. Peteete headstone is
provided in Figure 93. J.M. Peteete died at
22 years of age.

Four gravestones were located at the
cemetery
in
an
area
measuring
approximately 7.5x7.5 meters in size (Figure
89).
An overview photograph of the
location of the Peteete Cemetery is provided
in Figure 90. Two of the gravestones are
located inside the metal fencing.

Headstone #4 is the stone marker for John
W. Peteete.
This burial included a
footstone. A photograph of the John W.
Peteete headstone (reverse side) is provided
in Figure 94. J. M. Peteete died at 50 years
of age.

Upon examination the gravestones appeared
intact (Figures 89 and 90). There were four
headstones in all with 4 burials represented
including three adults and one child (Figure
89). The fifth burial is derived from
documentary evidence indicating the
presence of an additional burial at the site
(RootsWeb 2012)

As stated prior, no marker was located for
fifth burial at the site for Lillie A. Peteete.
Lillie A. Peteete was 10 years of age at the
time of death according to records found online (Rootsweb 2012).

Table 19 provides a list of the names and
dates indicated on the gravestones. The
marker for the fifth burial, that was not
located, was for Lille A. Peteete.

After completing the identification of the
visible burials at the site a total of 7 shovel
tests and 3 backhoe trenches (each trench
approximately 4-meters in length) were
excavated in the vicinity of the cemetery
along the known boundary located from the
northwestern corner to the southwestern
corner within the proposed workspace
(Figure 89).
Shovel tests and trenches at Site 41GM425
were excavated to a depth of approximately
100 cmbs and exhibited two stratums in
profile. Stratum I consisted of an E horizon
with light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sand from 0 to
35 cmbs. Stratum II consisted of a deeper E
horizon of brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam
extending to 100 cmbs.

Headstone #1 is a marker for T.H. Peteete
(Figure 91).
This burial included a
footstone. A photograph of the T.H. Peteete

Given the relatively undisturbed context of
the burial markers located at the Peteete
113

Cemetery, there is no reason to suspect that
they do not mark the location of the
identified burials on the markers.
Additional investigation in the immediate
vicinity within the proposed workspace was
unable to locate any additional burials.
Site 41GM425 is located outside of the
proposed workspace for the current project
within the 300-foot-wide survey corridor.
SWCA
recommends
continued
AVOIDANCE of Site 41GM425 - Peteete
Cemetery. SWCA further recommends that
an Archaeologist familiar with the site
should erect a safety barrier fence along the
margins of the workspace to ensure no
disturbance during pipeline construction.
The site remains UNEVALUATED for
listing in the NRHP.

artifacts or features were observed on the
surface of the site.

Artifacts recovered from shovel test
excavation and from Trench 2 included 38
pieces of debitage, 1 prehistoric ceramic, 12
fragments of modern glass, seven fragments
of sheet metal, and 1 nail fragment. Table
21 provides an accounting of the artifacts
recovered by depth/stratum
All artifacts were recovered from Stratum I
(0 to 100 cmbs). Historic artifacts were
recovered as deep as 80 centimeters below
surface. No artifacts were derived from
Stratums II and III.

Forty-two subsurface tests were advanced
within the current proposed survey corridor
to delineate the site (Figure 100). A total of
18 of the 42 shovel tests were positive for
cultural material with items being recovered
from the surface to as much as 100 cmbs.

Site 41GM428 is a multi-component site
consisting of a small scatter of historic
dating to the early twentieth century and
prehistoric scatter with a Ceramic or Late
Prehistoric period occupation. Although
artifacts were recovered fairly deep within
the soil profile the artifact assemblage is
limited in number and range of artifact
types. No diagnostic tools or archaeological
features were identified. Historic artifacts
were recovered as deep as 80 centimeters
below surface. The site extends outside
(north and south) of the 300-foot-wide
survey corridor.

Due to the depth of cultural deposits at the
site extending as much as 100 cmbgs, two
backhoe trenches were excavated at the site
to provide more data on the soil profile and
location of cultural deposits. Trench 1 was
approximately 6.25 meters in length and was
excavated as much as 185 centimeters below
ground surface.
Trench 2 was
approximately 14.2 meters in length and was
excavated as much as 170 centimeters below
ground surface. One column sample shovel
test was excavated within the profile of each
backhoe trench. No cultural features were
identified in the trenches.

Site 41GM428 has little research potential
and is unlikely to contain further temporal or
cultural functional information that would
contribute to the understanding of local or
regional history or prehistory. The portion
of Site 41GM428 located within the
proposed workspace and 300-foot-wide
survey corridor is recommended NOT

Shovel tests at Site 41GM428 were
excavated to a depth of approximately 100
cmbs and Trenches 1 and 2 were excavated
as much as 185 cmbs and exhibited three
stratums in profile. Stratum I consisted of

CHAPTER 7. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
From December 2011 to August 2012,
SWCA
conducted
archaeological
investigations along the proposed 580-mile
Texas Express Pipeline, Skellytown to
Mount Belvieu Project. The current report
comprises the results from the survey of 265
segments encompassing the terrace and
floodplains along anticipated USACE
jurisdictional waterways.
The project
corridor extends for approximately 286.5
miles under the jurisdiction of the USACE
Forth Worth District. This jurisdiction
extends from the Archer to Grimes counties
in the central part of the State.

The current investigation also surveyed a
portion of 41HI326, the J.T. Baker
Farmstead-Site, which was listed in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
in 1992 under Criteria C and D in the areas
of Architecture and Archeology with a
period of significance from 1881-1941
(#92000138). As proposed, the project will
have NO ADVERSE EFFECT on any
contributing archaeological deposits or
standing structures associated with J.T.
Baker Farmstead within the current
alignment of the survey corridor.
The remaining 29 archaeological sites
within the investigated corridor are
recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places
within the current alignment of the
construction corridor. Based on the current
project configuration, 20 of these 29 will be
affected by the project and nine will be
avoided.

Approximately 4,382 acres were surveyed
during the course of the investigations
within a 300-foot-wide survey corridor
totaling approximately 120.5 miles in
length. Construction impacts will be
restricted to an estimated 80 to 90-foot-wide
easement or workspace excepting any
additional temporary workspace within the
300-foot-wide survey corridor.

It should be noted that no archaeological
technique is completely adequate to define
all potential archaeological resources in a
given location.
Therefore, should any
unrecorded resources be discovered during
project construction, the THC and the
USACE Fort Worth District must be
notified.

The survey includes 33 newly identified
archaeological sites and investigation
portions of two previously identified
archaeological sites.
Sites include: 21
prehistoric sites; 2 sites with mixed historic
and prehistoric cultural components; and 12
historic Euroamerican sites (including 3
cemeteries). Table 22 summarizes the results
of the archaeological investigations and
recommendations for each site.
AVOIDANCE is recommended for all or
portions of 5 sites: Site: 41JA47 (Dry Stone
Wall at Fort Robinson), 41JN69, 41PR157
(Canafax-Brawley Cemetery), 41ML302
(Peteete
Cemetery),
and
41GM425
(Punchard-Alexander Cemetery.

SWCA Comments/ Recommendations
The J.T. Baker Farmstead property is listed as a National
Historic District. Although the current project corridor
alignment clips a corner of the NRHP listed property and
district, there will be NO ADVERSE EFFECT to potential
archaeological deposits associated with J.T. Baker
Farmstead. SWCA recommends that no additional work be
required in the vicinity of the J.T. Baker Farmstead as
currently designed.
The location of the current grave markers and the probable
location of the grave shafts are outside of the proposed
workspace within the 300-foot-wide survey corridor. SWCA
recommends that the proposed pipeline follow the
permanent right-of-way easement to the east of the current
location of the markers for the previously constructed
pipeline. SWCA further recommends that an Archaeologist
familiar with the site should erect a safety barrier fence
along the margins of the workspace to ensure no
disturbance during pipeline construction. The site remains
unevaluated for listing in the NRHP. Site AVOIDANCE is
required pursuant to Texas State Law.
