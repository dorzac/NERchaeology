In anticipation of this project, Lone Mountain Archaeological Services, Inc. (Lone Mountain)
conducted an intensive survey of every source point, in accordance with the scope of work.
Lone Mountain archaeologists, Jeremy Pittman and Brian Patton, performed this survey on
January 9, 10, and 11, 2018. Douglas Boggess is serving as Principal Investigator. The survey
was conducted according to guidelines established in Archaeological Survey Standards for
Texas, published by the Council of Texas Archeologists and endorsed by the Texas Historical
Commission.

awson Geophysical proposes to conduct a 3-D seismic survey on University Lands,
Ward County, Texas. Geophones will be laid along receiver lines by crews using
ATVs, while vibroseis trucks will travel along source lines. No drilling or grubbing is proposed.

Lone Mountain performed a file search of the THC Archeological Site Atlas and the NRHP on
December 5, 2018 to identify all previously recorded sites and surveys within 1 mi of the survey corridor. Eight previously recorded sites and eight previous surveys were documented
within this search radius. The sites, 41RV19, 41RV21, 41RV73, 41RV93, 41WR72, 41WR73,
41WR74, and 41RV75, are located outside the project area.
One historic site has been recorded within the surveyed area. 41WR111, the Pyote Army Air
Base, has a Historic to Recent Anglo/Euroamerican (A.D. 1942 to 2010) temporal and cultural affiliation. The site may produce additional important information concerning World
War II and the early Cold War in West Texas and is therefore recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criteria A and D, and undetermined under Criteria B and C.
41WR111 was flagged for avoidance. GPS locations of reroutes will be given to the proponent to ensure that technicians are able to avoid the site.
If buried cultural deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.

The proposed project is located on a fairly level plain just north of the Pecos River. This part of Texas sits within
the Permian Basin on the Quaternary Deposit, undivided geological formation. Quaternary deposit, undivided
was laid down during the Phanerozoic, Cenozoic, and Quaternary) and comprises sand, silt, clay, and gravel.
locally indurated with calcium carbonate (caliche); includes point bar, natural levee, stream channel, sand
dune, terrace, alluvial fan, landslide bolson and playa deposits. Elevation is approximately 2,600 ft amsl.
Soils are Hollebeke-Pokorny complex, 1 to 8 percent slopes, with Dellahunt-Neimahr-Joberanch complex, 1 to
3 percent slopes occurring along drainages. Hollebeke-Pokorny complex, 1 to 8 percent slopes is a gypsiferous
silt loam that occurs on hills as residuum weathering from the underlying gypsum. Dellahunt-Neimahr-Joberanch complex, 1 to 3 percent slopes is a loamy alluvium, also derived from gypsum and found in alluvial flats.
The project area falls within the Chihuahuan Desert. The average daily maximum temperature is 76 degrees
Fahrenheit and the average daily minimum temperature is 44 degrees Fahrenheit. The average annual precipitation is 7.7 inches, ranging from a low of 0.1 inches in April to a high of 1.4 inches in August (USDA 1980).
Vegetation is sparse, and includes creosote, mesquite, four-wing saltbush, tarbrush, acacia, soaptree yucca,
prickly pear, cane cholla, Christmas tree cholla, Spanish bayonet, ocotillo, horse crippler cactus, and various
forbs and grasses. Surface visibility is between 80 percent and 90 percent.

Shovel tests were to be excavated in settings that had potential for buried cultural materials and in places that
had a low surface visibility due to excessive vegetation. According to the survey standards, shovel tests would
be at least 30 cm in diameter or on a side and were excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits, if possible.
They would be excavated in levels no thicker than 20 cm, with sediments screened through Â¼-inch mesh.
When cultural remains predating 1960 were encountered, a determination was made as to whether they were
an isolated occurrence or a site. Especially intensive low-interval survey was to have been conducted in areas
where previously recorded sites were expected within or near the project area.
ISOLATE DEFINITION
Isolated occurrences are cultural remains that do not qualify as sites. They generally consist of single artifacts or
artifact scatters that are of extremely low density and are widely dispersed, and are indicative of a single or
unintentional activity. Isolated occurrences are often found in redeposited context and cannot be related to
other nearby sites or isolated occurrences. In addition, isolated occurrences are generally 50 years old or older,
although Lone Mountain may record more recent materials as isolates if there is a sound reason for documenting their presence. Isolated occurrences were recorded in the field on the Lone Mountain isolated occurrence
form, a GPS reading was taken, and their locations were plotted on the USGS quadrangle.
SITE DEFINITION
Sites are defined as any physical location of past human activities or events. Cultural resource sites are
extremely variable in size, and range from a cluster of several objects or materials to structures with associated
objects and features. A site may consist of secondarily deposited cultural resource remains. Features such as
hearths, cairns, rock alignments, masonry concentrations, burned adobe, fire-cracked rock concentrations,
cists, corrals, and rock art are generally recorded as sites. Sites also include definite locations of traditional cultural or religious importance to specified social or cultural groups. Furthermore, sites are at least 50 years old,
unless it can be demonstrated that a property has achieved exceptional importance within the past 50 years
(Criterion Consideration G).

SITE RECORDING
If sites were encountered, boundaries were defined according to Texas guidelines. Artifacts and features were
marked and site boundaries were determined by the distribution of these marked cultural materials. Sites were
recorded using a Lone Mountain Site Record form. A sketch map was drawn of each site, and site locations
were plotted on the appropriate USGS quadrangle. GPS readings were taken to verify the accuracy of the field
plot and were taken from a datum located on each sketch map. Photographs were taken showing the setting
of each site and any unique or representative features. A representative sample of artifacts from each site was
recorded using Lone Mountain artifact analysis forms. Drawings of diagnostic or representative formal tools

were made. Examinations of rodent burrows, road cuts, drainages, and other disturbed locations were
employed to determine if subsurface cultural deposits were present. Buried charcoal, ash, artifacts, burned
rock, or buried cultural strata constitute subsurface cultural materials.
EVALUATION AND ELIGIBILITY
If encountered, sites were to be further evaluated as to their NRHP eligibility status. The key criterion for most
prehistoric sites is the potential of the site to contain additional data relevant to future research (i.e., NRHP Criterion D). The potential for important additional data is often dependent on the presence or absence of buried
cultural deposits. On each site, the possibility of buried cultural deposits was assessed by a variety of means as
noted above. Observations were noted regarding the likelihood of buried cultural deposits based on several
characteristics. For example, indications of potential site depth include stratigraphic soil profiles exposed along
road cuts and arroyos or cultural materials in the back-dirt piles of rodent burrows.
Partially buried late historic and recent materials observed throughout the project area indicate that eolian processes operate at a rapid pace. In many environments, when the phrase âburied cultural materialâ is used, the
term âintactâ is usually implied. However, in an active dunal environment where burial, deflation, and reburial
of cultural strata may take place over the matter of just a few years, evidence for buried cultural material is not
necessarily evidence for intact buried cultural material. This adds another layer of difficulty to the evaluation of
sites. However, even a deflated site may be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP, especially if more
than 100 artifacts are present. In the case of historic sites, NRHP Criteria A, B, and C are more likely to be relevant. The relationship between the resources within the project area and the historical context of the project
area were taken into account when evaluating these sites.

41WR111, the Pyote Army Air Base, is located on fairly level ground adjacent to Interstate 20 (Figure 2.1). Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, Spanish bayonet, prickly pear, Christmas tree cholla, and various forbs and
grasses. Visibility is approximately 80 percent.
The Pyote Army Air Base was a WWII bombardier training base located one mile outside of the small town of
Pyote, Texas. The town of Pyote began in 1881 as a telegraph office that was built in an area called Pyote Tank
in west Texas. The telegraph office was meant to support the construction of the Texas and Pacific Railway
through the region. In 1907, a post office and general store were constructed. This was soon followed by the
construction of a one-room school house along with numerous homes and businesses (Texasescapes.com,
accessed January 12, 218). The population of Pyote grew steadily as oil was discovered in the area, reaching a
peak of 3,500 in the late 1920s. The oil boom would end by the late 1930s and the town of Pyote would be
reduced to a population of 201 by 1941 (Texasescape.com, accessed January 12, 2018).
Construction of Pyote Army Air Base training facility began in September of 1942, as the town population
reached its lowest. The flat and wide open terrain of west Texas proved to be a great asset for such a training
facility. Initially, the air base consisted of five large hangars, shops, warehouses, living quarters, and two main
runways that were approximately 8,000 feet long and 150 feet wide (Revolvy.com, accessed January 12,
2018). During the construction phase, Pyote Army Air Base would gain its nickname, âRattlesnake Bomber
Base,â due to the large number of rattlesnakes encountered in the area (Figure 2.2).

In 1963, following the closing of the radar station, the property transferred back to the ownership of the University of Texas. During this time, the Texas Youth Council founded an orphanage, the West Texas Children's
Home of Pyote, at the northeastern edge of the old air base, where some of the base's housing and personnelsupport structures remained and could be repurposed. In the early 1980s, this facility was turned into a state
school for youth offenders. In 1990, the school's name was changed to the West Texas State School. The
school campus contains brick buildings, dormitories, and recreational structures, some replacing original base
buildings. In 2010, the school was closed. The campus remains fenced off, and Lone Mountain did not have
access to this portion of the former base (Figure 2.5).
Several historic structural features and runways are present on the remainder of the site, in varying states of
disrepair. These include two standing walls of the 3rd Echelon Maintenance hangar, an adjacent brick building,
three concrete block buildings, and four sets of building pads or foundations (Figures 2.5 through 2.11).
A 27-inch by 42-inch Historical Marker commemorating the âRattlesnake Bomber Baseâ (Atlas Number
5475004204) was placed at this site in 1984, bearing the legend:
Nicknamed for the numerous rattlesnake dens that were uncovered during its construction, Pyote Army
Air Base was established in 1942 to train replacement crews for bombers during World War II. Located
on 2,700 acres of University of Texas land, the base consisted of two 8,400-foot runways, five large hangars, and hundreds of buildings used to house 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers and 2,000 civilians. On Jan. 1,
1943, the 19th Bombardment Group (later known as the 19th Combat Crew training B-17 bomber
crews. Pyote came to be highly regarded as a top training field, and its crews set many new records for
flying hours. This reputation continued after the transition to B-29s was made in July 1944. During the
post-war years, the base served as a storage facility, at one time housing as many as 2,000 aircraft,
including the âEnola Gayâ, the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb. Pyote also was used for a
short time as a radar station, but by 1966 it was no longer economical to maintain such a large base for
so small an operation, and the facility was closed.

R E S U L T S
A N D
M E T H O D S

The base closed in 1955 and reopened in 1958 as Pyote Air Force Station, a Cold War-era air defense radar
station. During this time, new housing and support buildings were built for the base's new function. The base
operated under this new mission until 1963 when the facility was closed and control given to the General Services Administration (Revolvy.com. accessed January 12, 2018).

2 :

Following the war, the base was transferred from the Fourth Air Force to the Air Technical Service Command
and served as an aircraft storage depot, housing more than 2,000 planes under the responsibility of the
2753rd Aircraft Storage Squadron. The âEnola Gay,â the plane known for dropping the first atomic bomb on
Hiroshima, was stored here until 1953 when it was taken to the Smithsonian (Revolvy.com, accessed January
12, 2018) (Figure 2.4).

C H A P T E R

The air base would eventually be the home of more than 6,500 military members and civilians by the end of
1944 (Figure 2.3). The 19th Bombardment Group, equipped with the B-17 Flying Fortress, took up residence,
and the base was designated the 19th Combat Crew Training School in 1943. The base would later train crews
for service on the B-29 Superfortress. Most notably, the 381st, 96th, 301st, and 454th Bombardment Groups
were trained at Pyote Army Air Base from 1943 to 1945 (Revolvy.com, accessed January 12, 2018). During this
time, the base held several records for training hours flown. One such record was 321 hours in a single day
(The Rattler, June 7, 1945). The B-29 pilots trained at Pyote Army Air Base would gain praise for numerous
bombing raids over Japan. The Pyote Air Base newspaper, The Rattler, presented the air base slogan, âB-29s
From Pyote to Tokyo!â (The Rattler, September 12, 1945).

Most of the facility has been disassembled and it is unclear how much of the original base remains intact on
the campus of the West Texas State School. Construction of buried pipelines, bladed roads, fencelines, and a
well pad have contributed to deflation together with wind erosion, water erosion, and rodent burrowing. The
site remains approximately 20 percent intact at present. Eolian sediments have accumulated to no more than
20 cm in some areas. Subsurface cultural materials are unlikely.

SUMMARY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES ï 
AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Lone Mountain found a single archaeological site within the surveyed area. 41WR111, the Pyote Army Air
Base, has a Historic to Recent Anglo/Euroamerican (A.D. 1942 to 1955/1963/2010). The site may produce
additional important information concerning World War II and the early Cold War in West Texas and is therefore recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criteria A and D, and undetermined under Criteria B and C.
41WR111 was flagged for avoidance. GPS locations of reroutes will be given to the proponent to ensure that
field technicians are able to avoid the site.
If buried cultural deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should
cease immediately, and the Texas State Historic Office and the Bureau of Land Management-Carlsbad Field
Office should be notified.

C H A P T E R

2 :

M E T H O D S

This site has a Historic to Recent Anglo/Euroamerican (A.D. 1942 to 1955/1963/2010) temporal and cultural
affiliation, as portions of the site remained in use until 1963 and 2010. The site played a significant role in
national history. A more thorough examination of the historic record may identify historically important individuals, as many were associated with the Bomber groups stationed at this facility. The standing structures
remaining outside of the fence may or may not retain characteristic WWII or Cold War era workmanship, and
it is unclear whether any structures with this characteristic workmanship remain on the West Texas State
School campus. The site may produce additional important information concerning World War II and the early
Cold War in West Texas. 41WR111 is recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criteria A and
D, and has not fully been evaluated under Criteria B and C.
