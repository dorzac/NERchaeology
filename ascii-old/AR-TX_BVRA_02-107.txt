ABSTRACT
A Phase I cultural resources survey of a 12 acre tract in central Somervell
County, Texas was conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan,
Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 2950 in September 2002 with William E
Moore the Principal Investigator. This work was done at the request of the Somervell
County Commissioners Court. No archaeological sites were found to be within the
boundaries of the project area, and it is recommended that Somvervell County be
allowed to proceed with construction as planned. Copies of the final report are on file at
the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division, Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The County of Somervell is developing a tract of 12 acres of land on the north
side of Wheeler Branch in the central part of the county (Figure 1). This parcel is
destined to become a retirement community for Texas veterans. If this site is selected
by the Veterans' Land Board of the State of Texas for construction of a Veterans'
Retirement Home, the property will be donated by the County to the State of Texas. A
cultural resources survey of the site was requested by the Veterans' Land Board as part
of the background information regarding this parcel of land prior to selecting or rejecting
it for the retirement home. The Somervell County Commissioners Court contracted with
BVRA to conduct a Phase I cultural resources survey in order to identify and assess the
archaeological potential of this area. The survey was conducted under Antiquities
Permit 2950, and the BVRA project number is 02-15. The field survey was performed
on September 6, 2002.
The project area is bounded on all sides by private property. The nearest stream
is Wheeler Branch, a tributary of the Paluxy River. It flows from west to east less than
50 meters to the south of the project area (Figure 2). The project area is depicted on
the USGS 7.5' topographic quadrangles Glen Rose East, Texas dated 1967
(photoinspected 1977) and Glen Rose West dated 1966 (photorevised 1979) (Figure 3).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
At 197 square miles, Somervell County is the third smallest county in Texas
(Moore 1975). It is included as part of the Grand Prairie geographic zone (Hill 1901,
Carter 1931). Altitude ranges from 600 feet to 1300 feet and is 630 feet throughout the
project area (Kingston and Harris 1983). Overall, the county is hilly with rugged areas
such as eroded plateaus and ravines where cut by the Brazos and Paluxy rivers.
Squaw and Kickapoo creeks are the two other major streams in the county.
Rain falls throughout the year, but is highest in spring and fall with an annual
average of 32.65 inches. Snow is infrequent. This is an area that is hot in summer and
cold in winter. The July maximum temperature is 98 degrees Fahrenheit, and the
January minimum temperature is 32 degrees Fahrenheit. A growing season of 236
days is normal.
According to the soil survey for Somervell County (Coburn 1978;Sheet 41), two
soil types are present in the project area (Figure 4). They are Krum clay, 0 to 1 percent
slopes (30) and Venus loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (53). Krum clay (30) is a deep, welldrained, nearly level soil located in broad, filled valleys adjacent to stream drainage
ways (Coburn 1978:19). Venus loam (53) is a deep well-drained gently sloping soil on
geologic terraces along small streams (Coburn 1978:27)

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Somervell County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical
region as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76) in a statistical overview published by the
THC. This is an area well documented in terms of numbers of sites when compared to
other regions in Texas. When the statistical overview was compiled in 1985, 2678 sites
(13.25% of the state) were recorded in the entire region. Only one other region (Central
Texas) reported more sites or had a higher percentage statewide. In terms of county
statistics, twenty-one of the thirty-nine counties in the region had as many or more
reported sites as Somervell County in 1985 (Biesaart et al. 1985:35). The forty-seven
sites known to exist in 1985 comprised 1.76% of the region and .23% of the state. The
reader is referred to the overview for more statistical information concerning Somervell
County and its relation to the rest of Texas. At the time of the survey, 151
archaeological sites had been recorded in Somervell County (Jean Hughes, personal
communication, September 4, 2002).
According to Biesaart et al. (1985:185), all major periods of Texas prehistory are
documented in Somervell County. Sites classified as General Archaic and Late
Prehistoric are the most numerous with 26 examples. The rest of the inventory includes
Paleoindian (n=3), Early Archaic (n=1), Middle Archaic (n=3), and Late Archaic (n=6).
Four sites have been designated as State Archeological Landmarks. Information for the
county comes primarily from surface collections at 27 sites with little data from testing at
2 sites and excavation at 1 site.
The first professional archaeological work in Somervell County consisted of an
intensive survey and preliminary testing program within the proposed Squaw Creek
Reservoir by the Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University
(SMU) in 1972 (Skinner and Humphreys 1973). This project examined an area that,
when flooded, will cover approximately 3200 surface acres along a six mile segment of
the Squaw Creek valley. Twenty-four prehistoric and historic sites (41SV26, 41SV28 41SV46, 41SV48, 41SV52 - 41SV53) were recorded within the boundaries of the
proposed reservoir in Somervell County, and three sites (41HD55-41HD57) were
recorded in Hood County. In addition to a surface survey, controlled surface collecting
and testing were conducted at sites 41SV30 and 41SV40 in Somervell County, and
testing was conducted at site 41HD55 in Hood County.
Assistance from various individuals, some of them members of avocational
societies, played a large part in the Squaw Creek survey. Their efforts resulted in the
recording of 24 sites (41SV6 - 41SV25, 41SV27, 41SV49 - 41SV51) out of the reservoir
limits.
The prehistoric remains at Squaw Creek were found to range in age from 8000
B.C. to A.D. 1500 with the majority of this occupation belonging to the Late Archaic
period. Historic use of the area was found to have begun about 1855. No evidence of
historic Indian occupation was found.

Excavation at the Hopewell School site (41SV30) was undertaken by SMU in the
summer of 1974 following the earlier pedestrian survey that recorded this site. Over
300 square meters were excavated to bedrock in large block areas. The site was found
to contain a temporally mixed occupation, although the Late Archaic period was best
represented (Gallager and Bearden 1976:iii).
A reconnaissance survey of Dinosaur Valley State Park was performed by SMU
in September of 1974 (Gallagher 1974). This study was initiated partly to add to the
growing body of data for the region and partly out of concern for the archaeological
resources of the park that are potentially threatened by an increase in tourism. The
survey was intended primarily to examine portions of the park thought most likely to
contain archaeological material, and no attempt was made to systematically investigate
the entire park. As a result of this reconnaissance, four archaeological sites
(41SV56-41SV59) were located. No artifacts were collected, and no shovel tests were
dug. The sites found consist of buried middens and lithic scatters with no diagnostic
artifacts observed.
In 1991, Brazos Valley Research Associates examined an approximate 200 acre
tract of land, the site of the proposed Glen Rose Golf Club (Moore 1991). This site is
south of and adjacent to the current project area. As a result of this study, one
previously recorded site (41SV51) was relocated, and four new sites (41SV3 - 41SV5
and 41SV47) were recorded. Four of the sites had been disturbed through golf course
construction that was ongoing at the time of this project. Only site 41SV47 appeared to
contain intact deposits, and it was recommended for Phase II significance testing if it
could not be avoided. Of special note, was the presence of two obsidian flakes at site
41SV5. The source for this material was traced to the Jemez Mountains in New Mexico
(Thomas R. Hester, personal communication).
An archaeological assessment of the 3000 acre Fossil Rim Wildlife Center was
conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates in 1992 and 1993 (Moore 1995).
This tract, on private land, was not subject to federal or state review. The owners were
interested in obtaining information regarding the cultural resources on their property and
hired BVRA to perform this service. Although parts of the property were off limits
because of dangerous animals, the project recorded 11 prehistoric sites, 3 historic sites,
and 5 isolated finds at Fossil Rim. Two prehistoric sites and one historic site were
recorded on private land with the permission of the landowner. Artifacts ranged from
Paleoindian to historic.
Two sites recorded by Gallagher in Dinosaur Valley State Park (41SV56 and
41SV57) were tested by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Turpin 1994). In
addition, historic site 41SV63 was assessed, and four new sites (41SV117 - 41SV120)
were recorded. Both sites tested date to the Late Prehistoric period.

8

The last archaeological site recorded in Somervell County was 41SV151, a
prehistoric hearth that was found buried on an ancient terrace adjacent to a former
channel of Squaw Creek (Moore and Bradle 1997). Fragments of burned rock, bone,
and charcoal were found between 95 and 110 centimeters in an adjacent trench.

PROJECT METHODS
Prior to the beginning of the field survey, a check was made of the site files at
TARL and the library at BVRA. This task revealed that no previously recorded
archaeological sites have been recorded in the current project area.
The current field survey was conducted under the direction of William E. Moore
(Principal Investigator) and James E. Warren (Project Archaeologist). The survey crew
utilized several maps during the field survey. They are a project map supplied by the
County of Somervell; the 7.5' topographic map, Glen Rose East; an aerial photograph
taken in 1939; and the soil survey aerial photograph taken in the 1970s.
A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted on September 6, 2002. Surface
visibility in the pasture was very poor due to the extensive grass cover. Surface visibility
in the corral was excellent, and this area was examined for surface evidence of an
archaeological site.
Since the county had made a backhoe and operator available, we decided to use
it initially in order to open up a large area. The first trench dug through hard clay to a
depth of 200 cm and exposed an area of 4 m x 1.3 m. Each 30 cm level of dirt was
screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth. It soon became apparent that only a portion of
the dirt would pass through the screen due to the hardness of the clay. Some of the
clay lumps had to be broken apart by hand. Because the pasture appeared to be rather
uniform, probably containing the same soil throughout, it was decided to use the
backhoe instead of relying on hand excavated shovel tests. This method would allow
for a greater amount of the subsurface to be examined and, most importantly, would
enable us to penetrate deeper into the subsoil. We were searching for intact features
rather than isolated and/or scattered artifacts. The six backhoe trenches exposed at
least 24 square meters instead of approximately 9 square meters that would have been
exposed through backhoe trenching. Since the area had been disturbed over the years
through various forms of cultivation, it was decided that the plow zone would not contain
intact deposits. In all, 6 backhoe trenches (BT) were excavated (Figure 2), and all were
dug to the subsoil between 140 and 230 cm. A backhoe trench log was maintained
(Appendix I), and field sketches of each backhoe trench were drawn (Appendix II).

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The project area consisted of an open pasture that had been planted in
Kleingrass and recently mowed and a small farmstead area that was being used as a
corral for livestock. An aerial photograph taking in 1939 showed that the project area
had been cleared for cultivation at that time. This was consistent with conversations
from local residents who stated that it had been used for agricultural purposes as long
as they could remember. Overall, the soils consisted of a clay or loamy clay that was
found to exist from the surface to a maximum depth of 230 cm based on backhoe
trenches. One of the backhoe trenches (BT 2) revealed a stratum of limestone bedrock
at 140 cm. No evidence of an archaeological site was found in the project area, and it is
recommended that construction on the site be allowed to proceed as planned.
