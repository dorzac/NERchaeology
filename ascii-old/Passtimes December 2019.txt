PANHANDLE ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
Minutes of November 20, 2019
The meeting was called to order by President Veronica Arias at 7:00 p.m. in the Amarillo Downtown Library.
There were 21 persons in attendance.
PROGRAM: The program for the evening was “Update on the Cross Bar Management Area” by Jaime Palmer.
Jaime gave a quick history of the different archaeological work done on the Cross Bar including John Northcut
and Brett Cruise’s work. There have been eighteen surveys and field school completed that covered approximately 4,207 acres with a total of 75 sites recorded. Jaime talked about different opportunities that he would like
the PAS to be involved with including: field work, grants, and research on the Cross Bar. He also gave some
history of the Cross Bar. The Cross Bar is technically opened to the public; however, it is land locked making it
difficult to gain access. About 9,900 acres of the Cross Bar are going to be turned into a Special Recreational
Management Area in 2020. This is where the opportunities come in to play. The BLM is going to be doing a lot
of work out there to get ready for this. They will be doing pedestrian surveys, monitoring already known sites,
and doing some interpretive signage. He also mentioned that knowing more of the history of the Cross Bar
would be a big help. He saw that there are good skill sets in the PAS that he wants to tap into.
MINUTES: Diedra Hood moved that the September Minutes be approved as published in PASTIMES. This was
seconded by Pam Allison and the Minutes were accepted.
PUBLICATIONS REPORT: Rolla reported that there was a balance of $2,383.75 in the regular account and in
the CD there was $5,239.20.
TREASURER’S REPORT: Pam said she will email out the report.
OLD BUSINESS: Scott said we did a good job on the TAS annual meeting. The annual meeting made roughly
$11,100. The money will be split between the TAS and PAS, with the PAS receiving $4,300.
The first call of papers for the Southwest Federation was sent out. The Federation will be held at the PanhandlePlains Historical Museum on April 4th, 2020. The deadline to submit papers is March 14th. Submissions are to be
made to Paul Katz or Rolla Shaller.
NEW BUSINESS: The Studer banquet will be Saturday December 14th at 6:00 pm at Youngbloods Café. Dr.
Fred Schneider will be the speaker. The cost is $30 and includes a chicken fried steak meal with cobbler and tea.
Bring stuff and money for the silent auction. Please RSVP to Rolla Shaller.
Elections for the 2020-2022 term: Rolla sent the nominations out. Joe D. Rogers motioned that the slate be accepted and Alvin Lynn seconded. This was passed unanimously.
Marketing Suggestions and Facebook: More outreach opportunities and creating a Twitter and Instagram account were accepted by all in attendance. It was also suggested that we go to classrooms at the end of the year.
4th and 5th grades would probably be best. Also it was discussed that the society should be a part of the Palo Duro
Canyon Prairie Palooza (used to be History Day). Erin Frigo agreed to contact Lindsey Pannell with PDC. Also
suggested we talk with other organizations to get our name out there. Live streaming was discussed as was asking students at Texas Tech, ENMU, and OU if they need help with projects. Mike Keith will check to see about
getting our logo from a printing press on a scale to pass out. Mary Ruthe said we need to reach out to Newspaper
and TV stations. She also mentioned that she was disappointed about the advertising for the TAS annual meeting. Erin agreed to talk to the Newspaper and TV stations about getting the Studer Banquet advertised.
Scott Brosowske motioned to adjourn the meeting.
The meeting adjourned at 8:32 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,
Miranda Bible, Substitute Secretary

Anthropological, Archaeological, and Ethnobotanical Evidence for the Use of
Native and Domesticated Plants among Indigenous Peoples of the Great Plains
Fred Schneider, Ph. D
University of North Dakota
Professor Emeritus
Biography and Abstract

Dr. Fred Schneider received his degrees
in anthropology from Beloit College (B.A.),
the University of Oklahoma (M.A.), and the
University of Missouri (Ph D.). He helped establish the Department of Anthropology at the
University of North Dakota in 1972 and retired Professor Emeritus in 2003. During 32
years in North Dakota he developed research
interests in Native American Gardening and in
Native American Ethnobotany (Uses of Native
Plants). He studied North Dakota traditional
gardening and native plant use of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara tribes on the Fort
Berthold Reservation. The research has involved field investigations, consultations
and trade for seed with Native Peoples, examination of museum library archives, and
contacts with ethnobotanists, botanists, and anthropologists.
For several years he maintained four separate gardens so as to prevent cross
pollination of plants. Produce was provided to Native Students on the University of
North Dakota campus for a feast associated with a new major exhibit at the North
Dakota State Historical Society, and seed was provided to garden projects associated
with regional museums as well as to garden projects located on regional reservations
in the United States and Canada. Seed was also supplied to the USDA Plant Introduction Station in Ames, Iowa and to Seed Savers Exchange, the largest public seed
preservation project in the U.S. Dozens of presentations were given throughout the
North Dakota in museums, schools, libraries, service organizations, restaurants, and
even in bars!

Biography and Abstract continued...
With retirement from the University of North Dakota and a move to
Norman, Oklahoma traditional garden seed has been obtained from regional Native Peoples and grown out in the Norman Master Gardener Teaching and Demonstration Garden. An Oklahoma Ethnobotanical Garden was also established to
demonstrate and tell the story of regional tribal use of native plants. Talks have
been given at meetings of the Oklahoma Native Plant Society, Oklahoma Organic
Gardening Association, Oklahoma Anthropological Society, the Sam Noble Museum of Natural History, chapters of the Oklahoma Master Gardener Association,
Cameron University, a class at the University of Oklahoma, and meetings of the
Plains Anthropological Society, North Dakota Archaeological Society, Manitoba
Archaeological Society, South Dakota Historical Society, and North Dakota Historical Society.
A major concern throughout the years has been to preserve the traditional
seed stock, to make it available to Native Peoples, and to those with serious gardening interests. Coupled with this has been the concern of preserving and making
public the amazing stories of tribal uses of native plants and to convince people of
the utility of these plants in their home gardens. These native plants are hardy to
the region, and once planted, need little concern for water, fertilizer, and protection from insects and disease. These are “tough” plants and have interesting stories
of traditional tribal uses associated with them. Fortunately, there are more and
more retail sources for these plants.
Dr. Schneider will provide an overview of his research and development of Oklahoma Native American vegetable and native plant gardens. He will
speak to some recent discoveries associated with his development of the ethnobotanies of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara tribes of North Dakota. These discoveries add considerable insight to the role and importance of the traditional
trade of native plants, but also have implications for the interpretations of archaeological sites.

PALO DURO PRAIRIE PALOOZA (2019)
A few of our members, Andy Burcham and Erin Frigo, represented the PAS at this year’s
Palo Duro Prairie Palooza (formerly known as History Days). Many local elementary
schools attended the event, and we offered activities for the kids that included corn grinding,
cord making, and fire making. The kiddos sure did seem to enjoy it! We even had a kiddo
that stayed at the corn grinding station the whole time until he had turned that corn into
flour! We were also later told that many of the kids couldn’t stop talking about what they
got to do at our corner! It was a pretty great day! And we’ll be doing it again next year!
