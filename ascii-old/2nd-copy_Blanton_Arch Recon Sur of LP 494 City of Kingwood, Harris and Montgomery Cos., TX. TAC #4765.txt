ABSTRACT
On February 25, 2005, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. conducted an archeological
reconnaissance survey of approximately 8,448 feet (1.6 miles) of LP 494 from Sorters-McClellan Road to
just north of Kingwood Drive in the City of Kingwood in Harris and Montgomery Counties, Texas, prior
to proposed roadway widening (CSJs: 0177-14-001 and 0177-15-003). The reconnaissance was
performed at the request of KBR, Inc., on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s Houston
District. Investigations discovered no archeological materials within the APE, only evidence of extensive
surface and subsurface disturbances. No artifacts were collected and curation was unnecessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Reconnaissance Survey on LP 494 from Sorters-McClellan Road to
Just North of Kingwood Drive the City of Kingwood, Harris and Montgomery Counties, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved a records review and an archeological reconnaissance
survey prior to proposed roadway widening of 8,448 feet (1.6 miles) of LP 494 in the City of Kingwood,
Texas (CSJs: 0177-14-01 and 0177-15-003). The proposed improvements would consist of widening
Loop 494 from Sorters-McClellan Road to a point approximately 725 feet north of Kingwood Drive in
Harris and Montgomery Counties, Texas. The existing right-of-way (ROW) is 160 feet wide with a
partially divided 60-foot wide roadway with no shoulders that consists of four 12-foot wide travel lanes
and a 12-foot wide left turn lane. Construction would widen LP 494 to a four-lane divided urban section
with a center left turn lane and curbs and gutters. No new ROW would be required as the planned
construction would occur entirely within the within the existing 160-foot wide LP 494 ROW. The Area of
Potential Effect (APE) is approximately 8,448 feet in length, 160 feet wide, encompasses 31.0 acres, and
would extend to a maximum depth of four feet below the ground surface for roadway improvements and
10 feet for culvert replacements.
PROJECT LOCATION: The linear project area is located on the Moonshine Hill, Texas USGS 7.5minute topographic quadrangle in the City of Kingwood in Harris and Montgomery counties.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 31.0 acres.
DATE OF WORK: 25 February 2005.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A) is assisting the project sponsor in their
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Antiquities Code
of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4765
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Investigations discovered no archeological resources within the project corridor, only
evidence of extensive surface and subsurface disturbances within the existing LP 494 ROW from buried
utilities, drainage improvement, and roadway construction and maintenance. Given the existing disturbed
conditions within the ROW, as well as the Potential Archeological Liability Map data for the project area,
it is the opinion of B&A that it is extremely unlikely that intact buried archeological deposits would be
discovered during construction and, as such, the proposed project should be allowed to proceed as
planned within the existing ROW without additional investigations. If the planned construction or future

investigations may be necessary in those areas.

INTRODUCTION
On February 25, 2005, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A) conducted an archeological
reconnaissance survey archeological survey of approximately 8,448 feet (1.6 miles) of LP 494 from
Sorters-McClellan Road to just north of Kingwood Drive in the City of Kingwood in Harris and
Montgomery Counties, Texas prior to proposed roadway widening (CSJs: 0177-14-01 and 0177-15-003)
(Figures 1 and 2). The survey was performed at the request of KBR, Inc. (KBR) and on behalf of the
Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Houston District.
The project involved a records review and an archeological reconnaissance survey prior to proposed
roadway widening of 8,448 feet (1.6 miles) of LP 494 in the City of Kingwood, Texas (CSJs: 0177-14-01
and 0177-15-003). The proposed improvements would consist of widening Loop 494 from SortersMcClellan Road to a point approximately 725 feet north of Kingwood Drive in Harris and Montgomery
Counties, Texas. The existing right-of-way (ROW) is 160 feet wide with a partially divided 60-foot wide
roadway with no shoulders that consists of four 12-foot wide travel lanes and a discontinuous 12-foot
wide left turn lane (Figure 3) The planned construction would widen LP 494 to a four-lane divided urban
section with a center left turn lane and curbs and gutters (Figures 4a and 4b). No new ROW would be
required as the planned construction would occur entirely within the within the existing 160-foot wide
LP 494 ROW.
There are no bridges within the project area but existing culverts would be replaced. Culvert cross
sections are not available so, as a worse-case scenario, the vertical depth of impact at culverts was
assumed to be 10 feet or fewer. As with the culverts, there is no available depth of vertical impact data for
the roadway. As a worse-case scenario, it was assumed that the vertical depth of impacts for the roadway
would extend a maximum of four feet below the ground surface. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is
therefore approximately 8,448 feet in length, 160 feet wide, encompasses 31.0 acres, and would extend to
a maximum depth of four feet below the existing ground surface for roadway improvements and 10 feet
for culvert replacements.
As the construction will occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by TxDOT, the
project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of
the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for recognition and
preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any state agency must identify
potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs.
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of Archeology administers the code’s provisions.
Archeological surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC in
accordance with the provisions of the code. The project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 4765 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the

NHPA is to consider the effects on historic properties that might be threatened by actions that are
federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), states
that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any historic properties eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or
permitted by federal agencies.
Protection of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on
criteria defined by the National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Protection of archeological sites
under state law is tied to eligibility for formal SAL status pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. Federal and state
review of this project will occur pursuant to the First Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the FHWA,
TxDOT, THC, and the ACHP Regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings, as well as
the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and THC. Field investigations were also
conducted in accordance with the PA and MOU.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council
of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all
cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural resources be located, make
recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or
further investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area is located on the Gulf Coastal Plain in the Piney Woods of southeast Texas—“the
western margin of the southern coniferous forest belt that stretches…virtually uninterrupted from the
Atlantic Ocean” (Jordan et al. 1982:29). The Piney Woods of Texas encompasses approximately 25,000
square miles and supports a variety of pine and hardwood species (Jordan et al. 1982:28). The current
study area occupies the Longleaf pine zone characterized by a mixture of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda),
short-leaf pine (Pinus echinata), water oak (Quercus nigra, post oak (Quercus stellata), and blackjack
oak (Quercus marilandica). Topographically, the study area is nearly level to gently rolling. Climate of
the project area is characterized as humid subtropical with abundant and well-distributed precipitation
(McClintock et al. 1972:67). Land use adjacent to the project area is primarily commercial.
Geology of the project area is the Pleistocene-age Beaumont Formation that is described as:
“clay, silt, and sand; includes mostly stream channel, point bar, natural levee,
backswamp, and…coastal marsh and mud-flat deposits”, though the APE is in an area of
the Beaumont Formation that is “dominantly clayey sand and silt…level relief with local
mounds and ridges, and…geologic units include meanderbelt, levee, crevasse splay, and
distributary sands (Barnes 1992).”
Soils in the project area are of Pleistocene and Quaternary age and have been dramatically affected by
urbanization. In the northern part of the APE in Montgomery County is Sorter silt loam, 0 to 1 percent
slopes, and Aris loam, 0 to 1 percent slope. Both soils are found on coastal plain flats and formed from
Pleistocene fluviomarine deposits and hydric in nature. Given the age and derivation of these soils, they
possess little potential for containing intact buried cultural deposits (McClintock et al. 1972).
In the Harris County part of the APE, from north to south, are soils of the Ozan-Urban complex, the
Kenney-Urban land complex, and Hatliff loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes. The loamy Ozan component of the
complex consists of loam overlying clay loams that formed in situ from marine deposits and is found on
river floodplains. South of the Ozan-Urban land complex is an area of the Kenney-Urban land complex.
The loamy Kenney component is found on river terraces and formed from Quaternary loamy alluvium
(Wheeler 1976). If intact, the loamy Kenney soil could possess a reasonable potential for containing intact
buried archeological deposits. However, the urban setting of the APE generally precludes the presence of
such deposits.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A review of data available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and the 1936 General Highway Maps of Harris and
Montgomery Counties was conducted to determine the presence of any previously recorded sites or
previous project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of the APE. The review indicated that there are no
previously recorded prehistoric or historic-era cultural resources or project areas within search area.

METHODS
The archeological reconnaissance survey involved surface investigations of sufficient intensity to
determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any discovered cultural resources. Field
investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as survey guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983).
Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA among the FHWA, the THC,
the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian non-collection reconnaissance of the project
area involving a systematic examination of the ground surface within the APE for archeological remains.
Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) data for the project area provided by TxDOT’s Houston
District recommends that no archeological investigations are necessary (Figure 5). Because the proposed
construction would occur within the existing disturbed LP 494 ROW, in conjunction with the PALM
recommendations, shovel testing was unwarranted. All field investigations were thoroughly documented
with digital cameras. No cultural materials were collected so curation was unnecessary.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
The reconnaissance discovered no archeological materials in or adjacent to the LP 494 APE.
Investigations revealed an existing ROW extensively modified horizontally and vertically from previous
vegetation clearing, roadway cut-and-fill construction, drainage improvements (i.e., ditches), and
underground and overhead utilities. Observed utilities include gas, water, wastewater, fiber optic,
telephone, and electrical (Figure 6).
The various buried utility easements parallel both sides of the paved roadway from approximately 55 to
100 feet from the centerline of LP 494. In addition to the utilities described above, there are lateral water,
sewer, water, and electrical lines running perpendicular to the roadway that serve the various businesses
within the project area. Ditches are present on both sides of the roadway roughly 40 feet from the
centerline of LP 494, with many containing culverts (Figure 7). The majority of the 1.6-mile long project
area is almost continuously flanked by paved parking lots and driveways of the adjacent commercial and
industrial development (Figures 8 and 9).
In the southern part of the project area from the Harris/Montgomery county line south to SortersMcClellan Road, the east side of LP 494 is paralleled by a Union Pacific Railroad ROW (Figure 10). The
distance from the centerline of LP 494 to the centerline of the railroad right-of-way is approximately 200
feet. The area in between the two ROWs was heavily impacted during the construction of the railroad
corridor and LP 494. Beginning approximately 1,800 feet north of the Harris/Montgomery county line
and extending north to Kingwood Drive, the roadway is divided.
Given the disturbed conditions of the APE, the PALM recommendations, and the negative reconnaissance
results, it is the opinion of B&A that there is no potential for the APE to contain previously unidentified
archeological deposits.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The urbanization and development along LP 494, as well as the construction of the roadway itself, has
greatly disturbed (horizontally and vertically) the soils within the existing ROW. Given the Pleistocene
age of the soils in the APE, the PALM recommendations, and the dense urban development, the APE
possess little to no potential for containing intact buried cultural deposits with sufficient integrity to be
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP (as per criteria set forth in National Park Service regulations 36 CFR
60.4) or for formal listing as a SAL pursuant to Chapter 26.8 of the Antiquities Code of Texas. The above
data also suggest that there is little to no potential for the APE to contain previously unidentified
archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16(1)) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12).
It is the opinion of B&A that, given the PALM recommendations, the lack of archeological materials
observed within the APE, and the geology, soils, and levels of disturbance, conditions within the project
area are not conducive to the preservation of archeological deposits. B&A recommends therefore that the
project area does not merit an intensive survey or other field investigations in compliance with the MOU
(43 TAC 2.24(f)(1)(C) because the proposed construction would not affect any SALs or archeological
historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR 60.4 and 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1). In the event that unanticipated
archeological deposits are encountered during construction, work in the immediate area will cease and
TxDOT archeological staff will be contacted to initiate post-review discovery procedures under the
provisions of the PA and MOU.
