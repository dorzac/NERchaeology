On the prairies, prehistoric man was wont to
shift his camp with the stream. Thus he has left his
history strewn out all along the long gentle dipslope hills instead of in neat, well stratified middens
as he did not far away in the limestone country to
the west and southwest.

In those middens the oldest cultures are found in
the lowest levels. The accumulation of camp debris
has been confined to a very limited area, instead of
back farthest from the streams as is the case on the
prairies. In the middens all of the bones and other
perishable material has been preserved as the
deposits have not been
torn into by the agencies
of erosion. On the
prairies, once a camp site

those middens are apt to give a false impression as
to where ancient man preferred to live. There are
comparatively few of them when figured on a square
mile basis and the material in them has been
transported only a few hundred yards. Hence the
amount of waste, is in proportion, much higher than
on the prairies where every stone had to be
transported over a hundred miles, at least, and
probably over two hundred miles as a whole, as
the great bulk of it came from the Ouachita
mountains of southeastern Oklahoma and western
Arkansas. With few exceptions, the mano stones
are of Arkansas novacolite which outcrops in a very
limited area just south of Fort Smith, Arkansas.
There is on the prairies hardly an acre of ground
that does not have a few pieces of that stone or
some fragments of imported flint on it. Every stream,
including the smallest drains, has been lived on
continuously from one end to the other. In tons of
imported and worked material the prairies, as a
whole, probably, on a square mile basis, exceed
the fault zone country by ten to one.

There are certain shapes that cling to the streams
and some that cling close to the tops of the hills.
Then a great intermediate class are apt to be found
almost anywhere but usually clinging pretty close
to the edges of the bottoms; where they are washed
down with the sand and gravel terrace debris as it
follows the streamâs down dip.
Roughly the artifacts can be easily separated into
three general classes, high, low, and intermediate;
based on elevation above the beds of the streams.
Of these three general classes there are, of course,
numerous minor classes. The low, artifact found
right in the flood plains of the streams, are readily
divided into two general classes, those found
associated with pot sherds (Plate 24, Figures 6 to
14), and those not associated with sherds.

The pot makers, and those using polished stones
(celts of a dark serpentine are the only polished
stone implements so far found), were among the
last of the aborigines to live on the prairies as their
camp sites are always on sand flats where the
topography has altered little since they left. Their

The highest and older cultures can be separated,
geologically, from the intermingled intermediate
zone by a general terrace level, caused by a pause
in the uplifting of the country as a whole. This pause
lasted long enough for the streams to be forced to

as wide as their present flood plain levels. Since
that pause the country as a whole has been lifted up
about fifty feet and the evidence of that pause is
still plainly seen in the even
height of the general sand and
gravel terrace level.
For convenience the artifacts

It is on the sand hills that the highly patinated
specimens are found, some arrowheads being
altered to a depth of more than a sixteenth of an
inch. Since none of the artifacts have been found
actually in place in the terrace deposits, which are
immediately post glacial in age, the question as to
whether they belong to the age of the terrace is
unanswered. The evidence points that way.
Back above the sand hill level are found
occasional remnants of an even older terrace, that
stands close to one hundred and fifty feet above the
beds of the streams. In the remnants of that terrace
only four artifacts have been found. They are all of
about the same size and shape and are, in fact,
nothing more than sharpened stones, remarkably
similar in size and shape to the European âCoupde-pong.â Their age is also an open question.
In addition to these two terrace levels, and of
probably even greater importance as to the antiquity
of man on the American continent, is a thick deposit
of Quatenary sands and gravels in northern
McLennan County. At present there is a thickness
of some two hundred feet of that deposit exposed
in an area where it has been faulted down next to
cretaceous beds. In it are found, in place, numerous
flints that with little imagination can be said to have
been artificially shaped. That phase, of all so far
found, is open to doubt, and until unquestionable
shapes are found nothing will be proved. The finding
of artifacts in those deposits would put the age of
man on this continent back into preglacial times
and, for that reason, they justify a close searching.

In conclusion the Black and Grand prairies
contain gravel deposits which may contain evidence
of first importance as to the age of man on the North
American continent. They are strewn with all the
implements common to stone age man the world
over, some of great antiquity as measured by
patination; they contain polished stone implements;
and several ages of pot makers made their homes
upon them. One image, typically Mayan, has been
found close to McGregor in McLennan County and
on White Rock creek in northern McLennan County
is an old crucible shaped lime kiln that, from the
size of the trees in it and the absence of local history,
is at least Spanish if not Mayan, it is said to be
typical in shape to both. Thus with all ages of
American man present on the prairies for a day, as
it were, and each leaving his mark, the prairies have
a brief of his history in stoneâa history that can be
written once all the facts are known and properly
correlated and interpreted.
This writer has covered some sixteen hundred
square miles of the prairies in close detail in the
course of geological field work and in an effort to
interpret the story told by the thousands of artifacts
that have come under foot has made a special map
for that purpose, a map barren of all confusing lines
except roads and streams for location. On it the
exact spot that each artifact is found is recorded. It
is from that map, as it stands today in its partially
finished state, that the ideas herein expressed are
drawn. There is much yet to be learned; and many
wrong conclusions will probably be drawn; so that
the keeping of a collection in a well organized
workable condition remains of first importance.
