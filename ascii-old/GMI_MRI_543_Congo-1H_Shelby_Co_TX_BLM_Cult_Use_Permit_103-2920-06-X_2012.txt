EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for three alternative locations of the
proposed Congo #1H well pad in eastern Shelby County, Texas. This cultural resources
investigation was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., under subcontract to Titanium Environmental
Services, LLC, for XTO Energy, Inc. The purpose of this document is to provide data for use in
the management of cultural resources in partial fulfillment of obligations under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 96-515), as amended, and other cultural
resources legislation. Cultural resources investigations consisted of a records search to identify
previous cultural resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological and historic sites
recorded by those efforts, visual inspection of the project areas, and subsurface investigations via
the excavation of screened shovel tests and the examination of exposed soil profiles. Fieldwork
for this project was conducted on 8–9 February, 7–8 April, and 4 May 2011. Archeological sites
41SY357 and 41SY358 were documented as part of this cultural resources survey. Site
41SY357, the former location of an early twentieth-century general store, is recommended not
eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The eligibility of site 41SY358,
a Late Prehistoric Caddo hamlet or village site, is undetermined. Neither site will be adversely
affected by the proposed undertaking. Construction of the Congo #1H well pad will have no
adverse effect on any significant cultural resources. Provided the project is carried out as
proposed, no further cultural resources investigations are recommended.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., (GeoMarine Project No. 30563.02.13) under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC,
for XTO Energy, Inc., for the proposed Congo #1H well pad and associated lease road (Bureau of
Land Management [BLM] Lease No. TX NM 108092). Three alternative locations were
investigated for the proposed infrastructure (Figure 1). Alternative #1 is located adjacent to
Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 3172 approximately 0.15 miles (mi; 0.23 kilometers [km]) southeast
of the intersection with FM 139. Alternative #2 is located adjacent to County Road (CR) 2645
approximately 0.18 mi (0.3 km) from FM 3172. Alternative #3 is the preferred location for the
proposed Congo #1H well pad and lease road. The proposed project area is located on a low
terrace of an unnamed tributary of the Sabine River in eastern Shelby County, Texas. The
intersection of FM 139 and FM 3172 is located approximately 0.75 mi (1.2 km) to the northwest.
The community of Huxley, Texas, is located approximately 4 mi (6.5 km) to the southeast.
The three proposed alternatives for the location of the Congo #1H project areas each consist of an
approximately 5.5-acre well pad and lease road right-of-way (ROW). The landscape
encompassing the study area consists primarily of agricultural operations with some managed
timberlands and recreational infrastructure related to the Toledo Bend Reservoir. The proposed
project will be constructed on private property; however, the mineral rights are the possession of
the BLM and this project is therefore under the oversight of that agency. This work was
conducted under BLM Cultural Use Permit No. 103-2920-06-X for review by the BLM Field
Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Specific information regarding the design, ownership, and cultural
resources survey of each of the proposed alternatives is outlined in Table 1.
Cultural resources surveys for these three alternative locations were conducted on 8–9 February
(Alternative #1), 7–8 April (Alternative #2), and 4 May 2011 (Alternative #3) by Geo-Marine
Project Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster. Field assistance was provided by Brett Lang,
Lindsey Skelton, and Erin King. Melissa Green served as the project Principal Investigator
throughout the process of this investigation. As per BLM cultural resources survey requirements,
a minimum buffer area of 10 acres was surveyed around each of the proposed project areas. This
resulted in the cultural resources survey of approximately 48.5 acres for this project.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The three alternative Congo #1H project areas are located along a dissected upland terrace
adjacent to the Toledo Bend Reservoir in eastern portion of Shelby County in East Texas. These
project areas are situated in the Tertiary uplands of the South Central Plains (Griffith et al. 2004).
The soils of the region are derived from in situ weathering of the underlying Wilcox Formation
(Griffith 2006). This region is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice
1943). Often referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960), this region once supported a
diverse variety of flora and fauna.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
Shelby County is located within the South Central Plains physiographic region of Texas. This
region is characterized by rolling or hummocky plains underlain by the stratified shales and
sandstones of the Wilcox Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993). The project area is
located within the Tertiary Uplands subregion of the South Central Plains in the Sabine River
basin. The Congo #1H Alternative #1 location is situated on a dissected upland terrace of the
Sabine River valley adjacent to the Toledo Bend Reservoir (Figure 2) at an elevation range of
180–215 m (591–705 ft) above mean sea level (amsl) on slopes of 0–5 percent. Alternative #2 is
situated on a prominent escarpment of an upland terrace at an elevation range of 175–207 m
(574–679 ft) amsl on slopes of 0–20 percent. Alternative #3 is situated primarily within a narrow,
low terrace adjacent to an unnamed tributary of the Sabine River with a portion of the proposed
project area extending to the east and south along the toe-slope of the upland terrace. The
elevation range of Alternative #3 is 177–214 m (581–702 ft) amsl.

HYDROLOGY
The project area is within the drainage basin of the Sabine River. Numerous unnamed, smallorder drainages dissect the rolling uplands and meander across the floodplains of the area,
creating a complex network of streams, swamps, and sloughs. The three proposed project area
alternatives are located along the upland escarpment above the Sabine River valley. This upland
escarpment has been heavily dissected by several ephemeral and low-order unnamed drainages
that flow into the Toledo Bend Reservoir of the Sabine River (see Figure 2).

SOILS
The Congo #1H project areas are situated across three soil series and one soil complex (Table 2;
see Figure 2). All information regarding the soils of the project area has been synthesized and
summarized from data provided by the Soil Conservation Service (Griffith 2006) and the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (2010).

The Gallime-Guyton complex refers to intricately intermixed areas of Gallime series soils with
soils of the Guyton series. Gallime series soils are classified as Glossic Paleudalfs and tend to be
well drained, moderately permeable soils formed on Pleistocene terraces. Gallime soils typically
exhibit a brown fine sandy loam Ap horizon, approximately 25 centimeters (cm; 10 inches [in])
thick, overlying a light yellowish brown fine sandy loam E horizon. A series of yellowish brown
sandy clay loam Bt/E horizons typically extend from a depth of 70–158 cm (28–62 in). Guyton
series soils are classified as Typic Glossaqualfs and tend to be poorly drained and slowly
permeable soils that occupy depressions on Pleistocene terraces. Guyton soils typically exhibit a
grayish brown silt loam A horizon, approximately 15 cm (6 in) thick, overlying light brownish
gray silt loam E horizons to a depth of about 58 cm (23 in). A gray silty clay loam B/E horizon
typically separates the overlying E horizons from the underlying grayish brown silt loam and gray
clay loam Btg horizons between depths of 88–178 cm (35–70 in).
Soils of the Metcalf soils are classified as Glossaquic Paleudalfs and are somewhat poorly
drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed on Pleistocene terraces. Metcalf soils exhibit 8–
20 cm (3–8 in) thick A and E horizons of dark grayish brown and light yellowish brown silt loam,
respectively, overlying a series of yellowish brown loam Bt horizons to a depth of 76 cm (30 in).
Eastwood soils are classified as fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Vertic Hapludalfs. These soils
are well drained but very slowly permeable and formed on gently sloping terrace escarpments and
interfluvial divides. The surface layer typically consists of dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam
8 cm (3 in) thick underlain by a light yellowish brown and strong brown E/B horizon of very fine
sandy loam with few redoximorphic features, which might range from 20–30 cm (8–12 in) below
surface. A series of red clay Bt horizons overlaying a C horizon at 129182 cm (5172 in) below
surface is typical.

7

Soils of the Owentown series are classified as coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Oxyaquic
Dystrudepts. Formed in loamy alluvium along streams, these soils are moderately well drained
and moderately permeable. The surface layer consists of a thin (0–10 cm [0–4 in]) A horizon
composed of dark yellowish brown loamy fine sand. This surface horizon overlies a series of
yellowish brown, brownish yellow, and brown loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam Bw horizons,
each approximately 25 cm (10 in) in thickness to a depth of about 127–203 cm (50–80 in).

FLORA AND FAUNA
This region is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943) and
supports a variety of flora and fauna. The environs encompassing the project area consist of an
array of subtropical terrestrial communities. These ecosystems support a diverse range of fauna,
including several endangered or threatened species. The Sabine and Angelina rivers support a
diverse biotic community, characterized by hydrophilic vegetation and numerous aquatic
vertebrates and invertebrates that include 32 varieties of mussel (Unionidae sp.) and 104 species
of freshwater fish (Dahm et al. 2005). Mammal species in the area, either presently or
historically, include deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma concolor), feral hogs (Sus
scrofa), black bear (Ursus americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
Once blanketed by oak-hickory-pine forests, the area now supports loblolly and shortleaf pine and
is locally referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960). As the name implies, coniferous
forest ecosystems dominate much of the region, although variations in soil types, topography, and
drainage allow for areas of native hardwoods such as oaks (Quercus sp.), elms (Elmus sp.),
hickories (Carya sp.), pecan (C. illinoinensis), black walnut (Juglans nigra), tupelo (Nyssa sp.),
sweetgum (Liquidambar sp.), and others. Shortleaf (Pinus echinata), longleaf (P. palustris), and
loblolly pine (P. taeda) are the three native species of southern yellow pine. Uplands may harbor
certain hardwoods, such as post oak (Q. stellata) and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica).
Bottomlands near rivers and other major drainages are most often dominated by native
bottomland hardwoods such as water oak (Q. nigra), cherrybark oak (Q. pagoda), nutall oak (Q.
nuttallii), black hickory (C. texana), bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis), black tupelo (N.
sylvatica), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). Dense understory growth may often be
found in forest areas in the form of woody shrubs and small trees such as yaupon (Ilex vomitoria),
wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), rusty blackhaw
viburnum (Viburnum rufidulum), and other species. In recent years, invasive species such as
Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera), Japanese climbing fern (Lygodium japonicum), and soda
apple (Solanum viarum) have become well established throughout the Pineywoods as well. Much
of the general area is managed coniferous timberlands.

CLIMATE
The climate of the project area is humid and subtropical. The weather typically consists of hot
summers with high humidity and short winters because of the influence of the Gulf of Mexico.
Average annual precipitation measures approximately 135 centimeters (cm; 53 inches [in]),
primarily as rainfall distributed uniformly throughout the year. The average summer temperature
recorded in nearby Center, Texas, is around 27 degrees Celsius (°C; 80°Fahrenheit [F]), and the
average winter temperature is 8°C (47°F), with temperatures seldom dropping below 0°C (32°F).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

The following chapter presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native
American cultural chronology and Euro-American history of Northeast Texas. Given the size of
the region and the depth and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this
chapter must necessarily be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the
information summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The earliest known inhabitants of the Pineywoods of Northeast Texas were the broad-spectrum
hunter-gathers loosely referred to as the Paleoindian culture. Over several thousand years, these
nomadic people adopted more restricted territories and targeted the abundant game and other
resources in the region, typically moving in seasonal rounds to procure various foods and raw
materials. Given the abundant nature of these resources in the Pineywoods region, the local
populations continued this way of life for several millennia. This period of prehistory is generally
referred to as the Archaic period. By the Middle Archaic period, the people of Northeast Texas
began cultivating starchy and oily seed plants and, in the Late Archaic period, became active in
expansive intra-regional social networks based on trade and shared religious beliefs. Gradually,
the Archaic lifestyle became increasingly sedentary, due in part to increased reliance on
horticulture and the development of ceramics. By the Woodland period, the manufacture and use
of ceramics become widespread. The Woodland period continued to expand in cultural
complexity for at least a millennia, resulting in an increase in settled villages, the expansion of
extensive long-distance trade networks, the construction of burial mounds and the development of
elaborate ritual practices, the domestication and cultivation of native plants with starchy and oily
seeds, and the rise of societies led by hereditary leaders. From these roots developed the
foundation of the Caddo culture. Over the last millennia, the Caddo settled in permanent villages
and continued the development of maize agriculture and other effective methods of food
gathering, processing, and storage, elaborate ritual life, ranked societies, mound-building,
ancestor veneration, ritual and political centers, long-distance exchange, warfare, competition,
and sophisticated craft production. This information is presented to provide a context for the
evaluation of 41SY358. A generalized prehistoric cultural sequence for the Northeast Texas
culture area is outlined in Table 3.

Paleoindian (±10,000–7000 B.C.)
Evidence suggests human migration into the northeastern Texas region by approximately 10,000–
9500 B.C., although the exact timing and nature of the arrival is the subject of some dispute. In
Northeast Texas, numerous diagnostic projectile point styles, such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and San Patrice, have been recovered as isolated surface finds or excavated in later
contexts (Carley n.d.; Perttula 1988:17). Unfortunately, however, few Paleoindian sites in good
stratigraphic context have been found (Perttula 1988:17; Preston 1972, 1974), and those that have
received any sort of systematic excavation are scarce.
Despite the lack of good data relating to the early Paleoindian period in Northeast Texas, some
attempts have been made to generalize settlement mobility and intensity of site occupation,
drawing on the limited data that are known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other
areas. The people of this period are often characterized as living in small bands of highly mobile
hunter-gatherers, specializing in the hunting of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna. For instance,
a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group mobility in the broad
distribution of Paleoindian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of presumably nonlocal
lithic raw materials from which they were made (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story
1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large megafauna by Paleoindians in
the western United States, coupled with the known presence of similar species in Northeast Texas
between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Hemmings 1983; Slaughter and Hoover 1963), has
resulted in the popular conclusion that “big game hunting” was part of the Paleoindian
subsistence strategy in Northeast Texas. Although a possible association between a Clovis point
10

and mastodon remains at the Murphey site (Story 1990:185) does support this likelihood,
increasing evidence from sites to the west (such as the Aubrey site) suggests that Paleoindian
groups were less dependent upon “big game hunting” than has been assumed in the past. A more
accurate view of Paleoindian life likely includes use of a much wider array of resources (Ferring
1989).
The late Paleoindian period in Northeast Texas appears to be distinguished by the divergence of
the earlier, widespread fluted point tradition into several distinct subtraditions. The first of these
includes Scottsbluff, Plainview, and similar lanceolate point styles that appear to be part of a
more western or “plains-derived” subtradition in terms of origin and style; the second includes
Dalton and Dalton-related projectile points that have a wide distribution throughout the wooded
southeastern and midwestern United States. Some researchers have suggested that this Dalton
horizon represents an adaptation to the changing environment at the end of the Pleistocene
(Goodyear 1982:389–391), a view that has found some support in the addition of the Dalton adze,
a presumed “heavy, woodworking tool,” to what otherwise is viewed as a Paleoindian tool kit
(Kelley et al. 1988:21). San Patrice, an important complex that may be related to Dalton, is found
in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and southern Arkansas and is
characterized by San Patrice points, Keithville points, and Albany scrapers (Ensor 1987;
Schambach 1979; Webb et al. 1971).
Archaic (±7000–200 B.C.)
With the end of Pleistocene glaciation, the prehistoric residents of the region began to develop
into populations of efficient hunter-gatherers exploiting localized resource bases. This period,
and the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has become termed the “Archaic” period.
Representing a significant period of time (approximately 6,800 years), this period is characterized
by gradual changes in subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles. Archaic
populations are usually portrayed as generalized hunters and gatherers with more limited
geographic ranges than the preceding Paleo-Indian peoples. At the present time, there is no
evidence for the development of local cultigens during the Archaic period in Texas, although this
is not the case for the Ozark Highlands and other parts of the eastern United States.
The Archaic period in Northeast Texas is tentatively dated between 7000 and 200 B.C. As is true
for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle, and late
subperiods, has been applied in Northeast Texas. Although reliable dating for the Archaic period
in this area of Texas is virtually nonexistent, these divisions have been given tentative dates on
the basis of cross-correlation with more confidently dated and stratified sites in surrounding areas.
Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 7000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to
2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2000 to 200 B.C. (overviews that cover the Archaic in this
portion of Texas include Fields and Tomka 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1985,
1990). Archaic remains are usually found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with later
material (Campbell et al. 1983; Story 1981). General trends have been proposed that characterize
the Archaic period in Northeast Texas as (1) increasing development of complex settlement
system, (2) increasing population size and density, (3) increasing sedentism, and (4) development
of distinct group territories (Perttula 1988:17; Story 1985:52). Despite these changes, however,
no evidence of any level of horticulture has been reported from any Northeast Texas Archaic site
(Perttula 1988:17; Story 1990:Table 56), in spite of the fact that definite steps toward food
production were being taken elsewhere in the eastern United States (Ford 1985:347–349; Watson
1988).

Early Ceramic/Woodland (200 B.C.–A.D. 800)
The Early Ceramic period (200 B.C.–A.D. 800)—representing the introduction of ceramics into
the Northeast Texas region—is generally not well defined and is largely identified by similarities
in pottery and projectile points to sites of the Fourche Maline tradition north of the Red River
(recent overviews that provide good information for this period include Perttula et al. 1993; Peter
et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). Diagnostic artifacts consist of coarse plainware
ceramics, tempered with either clay/grog or bone, and Gary projectile points. The ceramics
generally are grouped together as Williams Plain; but given the wide range of temporal and
spatial variability present, they should probably be viewed as one or more undefined varieties of
that type. Discounting ceramic differences at the varietal level, the remains of the Early Ceramic
period in Northeast Texas seem to be most closely related to Schambach’s (1982:188) Fourche
Maline tradition in Arkansas. Despite other similarities to Fourche Maline, however, no Early
Ceramic period burial mounds are known in the Texas portion of the Great Bend. The few that
are known in East Texas occur in the southern Sabine and Neches river basins around the Toledo
Bend and Sam Rayburn reservoir areas (see Story 1990:Figure 41) at the Coral Snake (16SA48;
on the eastern edge of Toledo Bend in Louisiana) and Jonas Short (41SA101) mound sites
(Jensen 1968; McClurkan et al. 1966, 1980). The lack of such evidence in Northeast Texas
leaves open the question of whether or not this area was undergoing the same processes of
cultural evolution presumably responsible for the development of burial mound use elsewhere
(see Perttula 1988:18; Story 1990).

Formative (A.D. 800–1000) and Early Caddo (A.D. 1000–1200)
The Formative (A.D. 800–1000) and Early Caddo (A.D. 1000–1200) periods in the Great Bend­
Neches/Angelina regions are not well defined. Conversely, in the Cypress Creek region, Caddo
occupation of the area is well documented from ca. A.D. 800 to the period of historic contact. For
detailed cultural and chronological information, consult Thurmond’s (1990) treatise on the
archeology of the Cypress Creek Basin.
The Formative and Early Caddo periods are characterized by what may best be termed the Alto
complex or Alto sphere, a widespread manifestation related to the Alto phase, originally defined
at the George C. Davis site in Cherokee County, Texas, south of the Great Bend area (Newell and
Krieger 1949). The Alto complex shows strong influence from the Coles Creek culture to the
east and appears to partially overlap it in time. It also, however, shows a number of new
characteristics (Neuman 1970), including new projectile point types (i.e., Hayes and Homan
arrow points), new ceramic vessel forms (i.e., the carinated bowl and the bottle), and a new mode
of vessel decoration (i.e., fine engraving with red pigment filler).
Perttula (1988:18) has suggested that these and other cultural innovations, including the
introduction of the bow and arrow ca. A.D. 800 and increased food production based on maize,
led to increases in population and sociopolitical complexity during these periods. The settlement
system became increasingly complex, apparently involving sedentary villages and farmsteads,
special function sites (what Binford [1980] has called logistical camps), and mound centers that
were presumably ritual or ceremonial in function (see Perttula 1988:18–19). A number of such
mound centers dating to the Formative and Early Caddo periods occur in Northeast Texas,
including the T. M. Coles or Mustang Creek Mound (Jackson 1931) on a tributary of the Sulphur
River to the west of Wright Patman Lake, and several mounds at the lake itself (Stephenson
12

1950). Many more mound sites occur along the Red River and its immediate tributaries to the
north (Banks 1983; Miller 1986; Taylor 1949). To the south, the Bivins-Flanagan mound (also
known as Hudnall-Pirtle, site 41RK4) on the middle Sabine River is a major multiple mound site
with six to eight mounds, a plaza, and a habitation area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:129). The
George C. Davis site in Cherokee County on the Neches River may be the best representative of
the mound center-village site type, another characteristic of the Alto focus. The Early Caddo
component of this site likely indicates an immigrant group from the middle Sabine River area,
possibly the Bivins-Flanagan area, arriving prior to ca. A.D. 900 (Story 1990:325).

Middle Caddo (A.D. 1200–1400)
The Middle Caddo period (A.D. 1200–1400) in the Great Bend region includes what is known as
the Haley phase, the definition of which is based generally on mortuary data largely from C. B.
Moore’s excavations at the Haley site (3MI1) in Arkansas (Moore 1912). The Haley phase
appears to represent a development of the earlier Alto complex, and among the continuities from
the earlier period is the use of shaft grave burials for some members of the society, who were
accompanied by relatively rich grave offerings (Kelley et al. 1988:26). This phase was centered
in the Great Bend area in Arkansas, but northwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas also fall
within its peripheral influence. Haley phase components are recognized at the Hatchel site in
Bowie County (Davis 1970:44). Other Haley components, including the Cabe Mounds site
(Perttula et al. 1995) and the Mitchell site (Cliff et al. 1997), are known in the area. Coker
Mound (41CS1) also apparently has a Haley phase component, based on radiocarbon dates and a
reported Haley Engraved bottle in a mortuary feature (Perttula et al. 1997:17–20). Despite its
presence in Texas, however, the Haley phase was apparently most fully elaborated in the
Arkansas portion of the Great Bend.
In the Sabine River area, the Oak Hill Village site (41RK214) in Rusk County (Perttula and
Rogers 2007), Washington Square (41NA49) in Nacogdoches County, and Tyson (41SY92) in
the Attoyac River basin in Shelby County are among the major mound centers dating to the
Early–Middle Caddo period (Perttula 2000:24–25). Data from these sites suggest a horticultural
lifestyle based on maize and squash, supplemented by wild seeds, nuts, and tubers, along with
fishing and continued hunting of deer and other game. Mounds were used both as temple and
burial sites, and the larger centers were important civic-ceremonial areas. Many of the large
mound centers contained structures and plazas along with storage/granary structures and pits.
The distribution of the mound centers suggests an integrated society of rather complex socio­
political extent. The Washington Square mound, securely dated to the late A.D. 1200s, was built
at the crossroads between aboriginal trails (later known as the east–west Caddo Trace and the
north–south Camino Real) and may have been primarily a ceremonial center since little indication
of permanent habitation has been documented. Radiocarbon dates also suggest the possibility
that Washington Square was the successor to the George C. Davis site, which was essentially
abandoned by the early fourteenth century (Perttula 2000:24–29).

Late Caddo (A.D. 1400–1680)
The Late Caddo period (A.D. 1400–1680) includes the conclusion of the prehistoric period and
the initial years of European contact (for an overview of this period and the subsequent Historic
Caddo period, see Perttula 1992). The survivors of the Hernando de Soto Spanish entrada
13

apparently entered Northeast Texas ca. 1542, and the latter part of this period appears to have
overlapped with the initial movements of seventeenth-century European explorers and traders
into northeastern Texas. Numerous archeological complexes have been defined for the Late
Caddo period, several of which overlap their spheres of influence into the Sabine River. The
Bossier phase, though centered on the Great Bend region of Arkansas, has been identified in the
Sabine River valley (Dieste et al. 1985:2–20; Gadus and Howard 1988:31). The Titus phase
appears to be centered between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the Northeast Texas Pineywoods
and post-oak savanna. The Bossier, Titus, and Texarkana phases appear to be characterized by
small hamlets or farmsteads that were probably occupied by small family groups of shifting
agriculturalists. These farmsteads are apparently characterized by a limited number of structures
and a small family cemetery (see Brewington and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Jelks
1961; Perttula 1988; Wormser 1988). They presumably were associated with larger, more
permanent suprahousehold sites, including both mound centers and nonmound cemeteries, which
served to integrate the scattered households into a unified social group.

Historic Native American Period (A.D. 1680–1860)
The Historic Caddo period (A.D. 1680–1860) in Northeast Texas began with the founding of the
short-lived French colony Fort Saint Louis by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, on the
Texas coast and ended with the expulsion of the Caddo from Texas in 1859. During the closing
decades of the seventeenth century, French explorers, such as Henri de Tonti, Jean Baptiste Le
Moyne de Bienville, and Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, traveled through the upper Red River
valley and made contact with the Native Americans residing in the area. The primary Native
American groups inhabiting the Great Bend–Neches/Angelina region at that time consisted of
Caddoan speakers, presumably descendants of groups that had inhabited the area at least as far
back as A.D. 800. These Caddoan populations were divided very generally into the Kadohadacho
in the Great Bend area north of the Sulphur River and the Hasinai in the Neches/Angelina River
region south of the Sabine River.
The groups in the northern area comprised the Kadohadacho Confederacy (Swanton 1946:141).
The confederacy was originally composed of five groups—the Kadohadacho, the Petit Caddo, the
Upper Natchitoche, the Upper Nasoni, and the Nanatsoho. According to Williams (1974:286),
the Upper Yatasi and the Cahinnio joined the confederacy at a later time, possibly in the early
eighteenth century in the case of the Cahinnio and in the 1760s in the case of the Yatasi. The
confederacy apparently controlled the entire Texas portion of the Great Bend region. Don
Domingo Terán de los Rios, who in 1692 visited one of the Kadohadacho villages located just
above the Great Bend of the Red River near present-day Texarkana (Swanton 1946:57), noted
that their power extended as far south as Big Cypress Bayou (Hackney 1966:3). The origin of the
confederacy is unknown at present, but it may have arisen as a result of what was probably a
severe demographic impact resulting from the earlier Hernando de Soto entrada (cf., Smith
1989).
The Hasinai were organized in a loose confederacy composed primarily of the Hainai,
Nabedache, Nacogdoche, Nasoni, Nadaco, Neche, Nacono, Nechaui, and Nacao, but membership
apparently was fluid and fluctuating (Story 1990:322). An intertribal organization pertaining
especially to religious beliefs was the basis of this confederacy. At the top of a relatively weak
social and political hierarchy was the grand xinesi, along with the subordinate chiefs of each tribe
and their lesser officials (Bolton 1987; Story 1982:21). Although males inherited these offices,
females often held powerful positions and descent was likely through the female line.
14

René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, established Fort Saint Louis on the Gulf coast in 1685
(John 1975:182). By 1686, he had traveled northward to Caddo country. By the late 1600s, a
regular European presence/settlement into Caddo territory had begun. In 1690, the Spanish
established missions in the Hasinai area—San Francisco de los Tejas and Santísimo Nombre de
María—but abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to comply with Spanish
attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46–49). In response to St. Denis’s 1714
French trading post at Natchitoches, three more Spanish missions were established in 1716—a
second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas just east of the Neches River, and two in the main
villages of the Hasinai (Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción, likely on the Angelina River)
and the Nacogdoche (Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, likely on Bayou La Naña) (Swanton
1942:46–49). In 1779, a group of Euro-American settlers from the Trinity River moved into the
Nacogdoche area, and a rancher set up operations on Bayou Loco near or on the Deshazo site.
These moves, as well as intruding Indian groups, forced the Hasinai to emigrate westward to the
prairie or to withdraw into smaller villages. The French briefly regained control of Louisiana,
only to lose it again in 1803 when President Jefferson bought the Louisiana Purchase. The area
was now open for American immigration, which effectively forced the remaining Hasinai to
move to a reservation on the Brazos in 1845, and then finally to Indian Territory in Oklahoma in
1859 (Newcomb 1961:289; Swanton 1942:71–88).

HISTORIC EURO-AMERICAN ERA
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Euro-American and
African-American development of Northeastern Texas is briefly discussed in the remaining
portions of this chapter to provide a historic context for the evaluation of 41SY357. For more
extensive treatments of this period in North Texas, see Peter and Cliff (1990:Chapters 3 and 7)
and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J).

Spanish and French Colonization (A.D. 1542–1803)
The initial European penetration into the general area of North Texas occurred in the middle of
the sixteenth century (ca. 1542) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by Luís
de Moscoso de Alvarado after de Soto’s death, entered Texas in their attempt to reach New Spain
by land (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). Although Moscoso’s exact route is
unknown, archeological studies indicate that he apparently traversed the Red River valley
somewhere between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas. The party
crossed the Red River and journeyed through northcentral Texas to present-day Wichita Falls
before returning to the Mississippi River to travel to the Gulf of Mexico.
In the late 1600s, the Spanish introduced the first of their missions into East Texas. The goal of
these missions was to eradicate the indigenous religions and to Christianize the native
populations. The Spanish established missions—San Francisco de los Tejas and Santísimo
Nombre de María—in the Hasinai area in 1690, but abandoned them in 1693 when failing to
convert and control the local population (Swanton 1942:46–49).
The French, led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, first ventured into eastern Texas by
establishing Fort Saint Louis in 1685 along the central Texas coast in present-day Victoria
County (Davis and Bruseth 2000; Fort St. Louis 2009; John 1975:182), and in 1714, Louis
15

Juchereau de St. Denis set up a trading post at Natchitoches, in present-day Louisiana. Spanish
fear of an increased French presence in Texas led to the decision in 1716 to try again to establish
a series of missions and presidios in present-day East Texas—this time a second Mission San
Francisco de los Tejas near the Neches River, Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción (later
relocated to the San Antonio area in 1731) on the Angelina River, the Nuestra Señora de
Guadalupe at present-day Nacogdoches, San Jose de los Nazonis in northwestern present-day
Nacogdoches County—as well as Nuestra Señora de los Ais and San Miguel de Linares de los
Adaes in present-day Louisiana as a buffer against further French encroachment into that region
(Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46–49). When France and Spain went to war,
the French at Natchitoches attacked the Spanish settlement of Los Adaes, forcing the Spanish to
abandon the area once again (Newcomb 1961:288). After the truce in 1721, Spanish
representative Marques de Aguayo persuaded the French to withdraw from Texas. He
reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas.
In the Red River area, the French established Le Poste des Cadodaquious in present-day Bowie
County in 1719, and explored what is now Franklin County (Harper 2002). Bénard de la Harpe’s
1719 trading post (which became known as the Nassonite Post) on the Red River north of
present-day Texarkana was the first European settlement in the Great Bend (Cooper et al. 2003;
Kelley and Coxe 1996:21). Another effort by Spain to curb French influence occurred in 1760,
when Fray Jose Francisco de Calahorra y Saenz led an expedition to present-day Rains County to
make peace with the Native American tribes in Northcentral Texas. These trading posts
eventually served as illicit trading centers between the two European colonies: modern-day
archeological investigations have yielded artifacts of both Spanish and French origin that would
suggest that the different cultures interacted at the trading sites. After briefly regaining control of
the area, the French sold it as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

American Immigration (A.D. 1806–1830)
Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
North Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned the
area south of the Red River. The United States considered it (and indeed, most of Texas) to be
part of the Louisiana Purchase and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939).
Spain (and later Mexico), on the other hand, was violently opposed to this view, and at several
times during the first few decades of the nineteenth century the dispute nearly led to war (Smith
1991). The first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the Freeman-Custis
Expedition of 1806, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish
military force (Flores 1984). Early on, the area of Shelby County became known as a refuge for
outlaws and fugitives for its proximity to the “neutral ground,” a disputed area between Spanish
and American territories until 1806 (Coleman et al. 1984; Neill 1950).
By 1818, John Latham, the first Anglo-American resident of Shelby County, settled in the
southeastern portion of the area (Harper 2009). However, during that time Mexico restricted
settlements near the boundary of Texas, curtailed legitimate settlements, and encouraged
squatters, resulting in violence and low population of the area (Harper 2009). In addition, the
already existent population of outlaws and fugitives was not a positive in attracting settlers to the
area (Coleman et al. 1984). The Mexican government first organized Shelby County as a
Tenehaw Municipality, which was part of the Nacogdoches Municipality, and established
Nashville as the county seat in 1824 (Coleman et al. 1984; Harper 2009).
16

Despite Spain’s claim, North Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the AngloAmerican sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were confined
to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the
prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Dayton’s Road and Trammel’s Trace, the
present western boundary of Panola County (LaGrone 2008). Trammel’s Trace, a popular
immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur River at Epperson’s Ferry and
continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs, founded in 1839, and then
south to cross Cypress Creek 2 miles west of modern Jefferson (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:793–
794). Dayton’s Road was a major east–west overland route that ran along the divide between the
Sulphur and Red rivers.
The original Anglo-American settlers in Texas were largely subsistence farmers residing on small
holdings, with an economy based on grain and livestock production (Peter and Cliff 1990:36).
The commercial production of cotton apparently was not introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach
1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing numbers of slaves into the region.

Texas Independence (A.D. 1836–1846)
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained initially under Spanish and later under
Mexican control until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, North
Texas was beyond the direct sphere of the conflict associated with the fight for Texas
independence: that conflict played out primarily in South and Central Texas in 1835 and 1836.
The most significant change thereafter involved decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the
second president of Texas, to make the settlers of the Texas Republic safe from marauding Native
Americans by adopting an Indian removal or extermination program. Active efforts to drive off
or exterminate the Native Americans in North Texas had been under way for some time. In one
instance in 1837, a group of Texas Rangers under the command of Lt. A. B. Van Benthuysen
camped on Turtle Creek after conducting raids on Indians to the north (Maxwell 2002).
Subsequently, many native groups who used the Trinity River basin relocated north of the Red
River.
In 1836 the Congress of the Republic of Texas officially named the county after Isaac Shelby,
who was a Revolutionary War hero and governor of Kentucky (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper
2009). The town of Center officially became the county seat in 1866 and currently retains this
title (Harper 2009). From 1840 to 1844 a series of small, armed conflicts known as the
Regulator-Moderator War occurred as a result of fraudulent land transactions and land titles
(Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009). Although the war caused a great deal of devastation for
the economy, the county was able to recover, and by 1847 the population had grown to
approximately 3,500 residents (Harper 2009).

Early Texas Statehood (A.D. 1846–1861)
Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood on December 29, 1845, entering the union as
the twenty-eighth state. The majority of the settlers moving into Shelby County came from other
Southern states and thus introduced large-scale agriculture, livestock raising, and slavery into the
area (Harper 2009). Because slave ownership was not as predominant in Shelby County, it was
primarily restricted to white upper-class Anglo-Americans (Harper 2009). During the antebellum
17

period, the county was, for the most part, rural and agricultural, with most of the county’s
residents living on farms (Harper 2009). The largest crop of any kind and the most important
food crop was corn (Harper 2009). However, continuing with the Southern tradition, cotton was
grown and sold, making it the largest cash crop for the county (Harper 2009). Additionally,
farmers grew oats, raised cattle, sheep and hogs, and sold wool for profit (Harper 2009).
Texas, however, did not remain a state for long. Sectarian politics were raised to a fever pitch
during that period, and after the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession.
The sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of North Texas lay with the secessionist
southerners; after all, a majority of them had immigrated from the South, the region as a whole
had a substantial slave population, and the cash economy of the area was built on slave-based
agriculture even though most of the individual farmers could not afford to own slaves. In most of
Northeast and Northcentral Texas, anti-Union feelings ran high (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306),
and nearly all the counties in the area voted to secede—though some, like Delta County, did
support Sam Houston’s Unionist forces during the early part of the war (Hervey 1951). On
February 1, 1861, Texas became a part of the Confederate States of America. Shelby County's
white inhabitants overwhelmingly supported the secession movement during the winter of 1860–
1861 (Harper 2009). When the secession ordinance was submitted for popular approval in
February 1861, county voters approved the measure by a vote of 333 to 28 (Harper 2009).

Civil War (A.D. 1861–1865)
The white residents of Shelby County wholeheartedly supported the war effort of the
Confederacy (Harper 2009). One county source estimated that as many as 750 men from Shelby
County served in either Texas or Confederate army units (Harper 2009). Shelby County was
never occupied by Union forces and thus escaped the destruction that devastated other parts of the
South. However, the people and the economy still suffered with drops in demand, fluctuations in
currency, an increase in competition for resources, and loss of friends and loved ones (Harper
2009).
Northeastern Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far west of the
centers of fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of the
frontier to be affected by the resurgence of Native American problems that accompanied the
withdrawal of U.S. and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110–113). The defeat of the
Confederacy in 1865 brought with it the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slavebased plantation system, and the presence of a Union army of occupation.

Postbellum Texas (A.D. 1865–1920)
The end of slavery brought many changes in the economy of rural Northeast Texas. Lacking the
cheap and dependable labor resources provided by slavery, the large plantations of the prewar
period ceased to be economically feasible and many were broken up and partially sold off. Most
of the land put on the market found its way into the hands of speculators and investors, with the
result that a new system of sharecropping or tenant farming replaced the old plantation system.
Productive land was now often held by absentee landlords, with the labor supplied by AfricanAmerican or poor Anglo-American sharecroppers or tenants. Although most former slaves
remained in the county, many left the farms seeking better working conditions or establishing
18

their own farms (Harper 2009). Unfortunately, the majority of former slaves became
sharecroppers, a situation that did not leave much room for improvement from their former
condition (Harper 2009). Gradually, however, a small portion of the black population
accumulated enough capital to move into the class of landowning farmers (Harper 2009). In 1870
one black farmer owned his land, and by 1910 almost one-third of all black farmers were
landowners (Harper 2009). In addition to losing the main source of labor, white farmers also
faced serious plummets in property values. In 1859 slaves constituted 50 percent of all taxable
property in the county, but with the end of slavery and the reduced status of the South, property
values decreased by almost 40 percent, creating serious economic loss (Harper 2009). Although
this system failed to improve the lot of the sharecroppers and tenants, it was a successful
replacement for the prewar system, and by the beginning of the twentieth century, the bulk of the
rural farms in Northeast Texas were operated by sharecroppers or tenants.
After 1870, the population of North Texas began to increase, and the region began to recover
from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent recession. One of the most important factors
in this recovery was the increasing role of the railroad in the regional economy. Before the Civil
War, Shelby County had been predominantly rural, using waterways, mainly the Sabine River, to
export crops to the larger market centers (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009). A small amount
of railroad construction had occurred prior to the outbreak of the war, when more than 50 miles of
track had been laid westward from Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific
Railroad. Following the end of the war, construction did not resume for four more years. When
it finally did, though, it continued at a relatively steady rate. In 1871 and 1872, the Texas and
Pacific Railroad went through the southern corner of Upshur County and the eastern portion of
Cass and Marion counties. In 1876, the East Line and Red River Railroad (later part of the
Louisiana and Arkansas), building west from Jefferson, crossed western Marion County and the
southwestern portion of Cass County. In the Pineywoods of northeastern Texas, the Houston, East
and West Texas Railway from Houston to Shreveport was completed in 1882, quickly followed by
the Kansas and Gulf Short Line; the Texas Southeastern; the Groveton, Lufkin and Northern; the
Texas and New Orleans; and the Angelina and Neches River railroads. With the completion of a
local railroad line from Longview into the county in 1885, the already important logging industry
intensified, and continued to do so as the rail line was upgraded and extended to Carthage in 1888
and eventually became part of the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway (LaGrone 2008). The
Houston East and West Texas Railway was built through the northern portion of the county, and
in 1904 the Gulf, Beaumont and Great Northern Railroad was completed, crossing through the
center of the county from north to south (Harper 2009). New towns emerged along these railroad
routes and developed as important shipping centers (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). With the
arrival of the railroad, several towns were established and became quite prominent in Shelby
County, including Timpson, Tenaha, and Joaquin (Coleman et al. 1984:19; McCoy 1981). As a
result, the lumber business began to grow, providing new job opportunities in industry (Coleman
et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009).
The continuing expansion of the railroads after 1870, and the improved communications they
brought, spurred the development of other local industries as well. During this period, lumbering
assumed its place as an important industry in many areas of the Pineywoods of northeastern
Texas (Chandler 1937). The Houston, East and West Texas Railway and the Gulf, Beaumont,
and Great Northern Railroad allowed transportation of lumber from timber-rich Polk, Angelina,
San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Nacogdoches counties. Sawmills to process this
lumber also sprang up throughout these East Texas counties, especially in the town of Lufkin and
Angelina County, which led to innovations for lumber and paper production and provided another
19

major source of employment (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824). All of these mills helped supply
raw material to factories located in Texarkana and in other large towns (Webb and Carroll
1952:1:198).
In spite of the steady growth in nonagricultural industries during these years, farming continued
to be important in East Texas, with the small, owner-operated farm still prominent. Despite the
inequities of the sharecropper and tenant systems, the participants were not locked into the system
as had been the case under slavery, and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century
increasing numbers of African-Americans achieved the status of small landowners. Regardless of
their status, they often settled in dispersed rural communities separate from those of their white
neighbors.

Modern Texas (A.D. 1920–Present)
After the Civil War, agriculture and population began a slow, steady increase, and by 1940 the
number of farms and people had increased six-fold since 1870, but the percentage of farm
landowners had decreased from 77 percent in 1890 to 30 percent by 1930 (Harper 2009). Cotton
and corn were still the main crops being harvested by 1940, but most farmers still used the same
old methods used during the antebellum period (Harper 2009). Although there were increases in
crop production and population, prosperity was still limited (Harper 2009). By 1940,
approximately 90 percent of farmsteads were still without electricity and phone lines. Even as
agriculture formed the economic base of the county, manufacturing and industry provided some
jobs and a portion of the income in Shelby County.
After World War II, the population in Shelby County began to decline. By 1940, two major
highways crossed the county: U.S. Highway 96, which traverses the center of the county from
north to south, and U.S. Highway 84, which traverses the northern portion of the county from east
to west. In 1950, the Sabine River Authority was created, and in 1960, Toledo Bend Reservoir
was dedicated (Coleman et al. 1984:22). By 1970, the population was on the rise again; however,
the majority of the inhabitants were between the ages of 35 and 64, indicating that the youth of
the area were still moving out of the county (Harper 2009). Leading industries of Shelby County
included sawmills, poultry and egg processing, road construction, agribusiness, general
construction, and the manufacture of hardwood flooring, hardwood veneer, and plywood.
Mineral resources included lignite coal, sand, oil, and gas. Pine and hardwood production in
1981 totaled 14,867,416 cubic feet, the overwhelming majority of which was pine production
(Harper 2009). The Sabine National Forest also currently contributes to attracting tourists and
providing lumber, grazing, oil production, hunting, and recreation (Harper 2009; Miller and Tull
1984).

CHAPTER 4
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites and important architectural resources located within the proposed
project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and shovel test excavations undertaken using the field methods
described in this chapter. The second goal consists of assessment and evaluation based on
National Register of Historic Places criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
§60.4 (National Park Service 1990).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts as well as the locations of previously
recorded historic or archeological resources in the project area, the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas online database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was consulted.
Review of THC records and background literature indicated that five previous cultural resources
surveys have been conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area. Three early
surveys were conducted in preparation for the construction of the Toledo Bend Dam and the
inundation of its associated reservoir (Arnold 1940, Scurlock and Davis 1962, Scurlock 1964).
As these surveys were conducted prior to codification of modern cultural resources management
survey or reporting standards, the extent to which these early surveys coincide with any of the
current project areas is uncertain. In 2003, a cultural resources survey was conducted for
CenterPoint Energy’s Huxley Bay Pipeline, which traverses the vicinity of the project area
(Belew 2004). Due to the efforts of these previous surveys, five archeological sites have been
previously recorded within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the proposed project areas (Table 4). Sites 41SY13,
41SY14, 41SY16, and 41SY17 were recorded by J. Dan Scurlock in 1962 during survey efforts
for the Toledo Bend Reservoir. Although some limited test excavations were conducted at
41SY16, these sites have not been thoroughly documented and their eligibility for inclusion on

the NRHP has not been determined. Site 41SY290 is an early-to-mid-twentieth century
farmstead site identified in 2003 during a cultural resources survey for CenterPoint Energy’s
Huxley Bay Pipeline. Because the site extended outside of the Huxley Bay Pipeline right-of-way,
the site was not fully evaluated and the eligibility of the site for inclusion on the NRHP is
undetermined. In addition to these archeological sites, the Wimberly-Rayburn Cemetery (1870–
present) is located in the vicinity of the project areas. None of these previously recorded cultural
resources will be adversely affected by the construction of the proposed Congo #1H project.
Based on the geomorphology of the area and the locations of previously recorded prehistoric
archeological sites in the Sabine River valley and the surrounding uplands, the proposed project
areas were considered to have at least a moderate probability of containing prehistoric sites prior
to survey. Locations on and adjacent to upland terrace escarpments were deemed to have the
highest probability of hosting prehistoric human occupation. Various sources of historical and
geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of historic-era cultural resources
existing within the proposed project area. These materials include historic highway maps,
topographic maps, and soil surveys (which often record cultural resources such as cemeteries,
houses, and related features) and aerial photography. Based on a review of these historic records
and previously recorded archeological site locations, it is evident that the area has experienced a
dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more recent records, however, indicates that the
substantial development has occurred in recent years, altering much of the historic landscape.
Historic period habitation within the region was minimal during the nineteenth century, but
settlement increased markedly during the twentieth century and several structures are indicated on
historic-period topographic and highway maps of the area. Therefore, the project area is
considered to have at a moderate to high probability of containing historic sites.
METHODOLOGY
Survey Methods
Based on the background and archival research conducted, it was determined that the proposed
Congo #1H well pad project area had a moderate to high probability of containing cultural
materials. Given the amount of groundcover and the nature of archeological sites in the region, it
was assumed that ground visibility in the project area would not be conducive to visual inspection
and that subsurface excavation via shovel testing would be necessary to adequately survey the
area.
22

Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30–40 cm (11.8–15.7 in) in diameter excavated in
20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh
screen to recover artifacts. Shovel tests were excavated systematically across the proposed
project area to depths of 1 m (3.3 ft), to the extent of Holocene deposits, or until an obstruction
such as the water table or fragipan was encountered. The location of each shovel test was
recorded with a submeter-accurate Trimble® GeoXT™ global positioning system (GPS) unit,
and the exposed soil profile documented. Each shovel test was backfilled upon completion of the
recording process. Areas that were inundated, waterlogged, or completely disturbed by features
such as roads, stock ponds, or other construction were systematically investigated and
documented, but not shovel-tested. Areas of exposed soil, either on the surface or in profile (e.g.,
cutbanks), were also examined for cultural materials as they were encountered during survey. As
per BLM cultural resources survey requirements, a minimum buffer area of 10 acres was
surveyed around each of the proposed well pad locations. This resulted in the cultural resources
survey of approximately 48.5 acres for this project.

Archeological Site Definition
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural
resources. The definition of a “site” is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent.
Content may refer to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural
features, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the
horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. When only surficial
materials are encountered, a site is defined as five or more cultural artifacts or features of at least
two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 400-m2­
area [0.1 acre]); the extent of the surface material is then defined as the site boundary. When
artifacts are encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally
positive excavations. In cases where a shovel test yields cultural materials, additional delineation
shovel tests are excavated to define the boundary of the site. Shovel tests used to define and
delineate a site are typically placed at intervals of 10 m (33 ft) in a cruciform pattern (in each of
the cardinal directions) around the positive shovel test until two negative shovel tests, or the
project area boundaries, are reached. In general, if two or more positive shovel tests are
encountered and contain at least five artifacts of at least two classes of cultural materials, a site is
then defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. Cultural remains meeting these criteria are
designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to the
Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL) to be included in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
database. Conversely, the discovery of cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are
considered isolated occurrences of past human activity and are simply documented by location
and content; likewise, modern material representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not
considered a site, with only location and content documented.
Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. Isolated artifacts are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of
their failure to meet the site definition and their lack of significance in contributing important
information to the archeological record.

23

Artifact Treatment and Analysis
Each artifact was thoroughly examined in order to identify and determine, to the extent possible,
its function or role and cultural or chronological affiliation within the identified contexts. Raw
data from the artifact analysis is presented in Appendix A.
Prehistoric ceramic artifacts were examined for culturally- and temporally-diagnostic traits such
as surface treatment and decoration methods and temper type. Prehistoric lithic artifacts were
examined for indications of function. Historic period artifacts were examined for particular
attributes and diagnostic traits using morphological and/or functional classification systems
developed by South (1977). Analysis of the recovered materials assigned artifacts to one of four
primary categories—Activities, Architectural, Domestic (including Furnishings), and Personal.
The Activities category includes nonhousehold items, transportation items, farm-related
equipment, tools, and firearms. The Architectural category includes all items related to buildings
such as brick, mortar, plaster, nails, window glass, and electrical items. The Domestic category
designation is used for items related to food service (tableware) and food storage (including food
preparation and tin cans); a Furnishings classification, a subcategory of Domestic, encompasses
household items such as furniture, stove parts, and lamp glass. The Personal category generally
contains items of individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes, dolls, and smoking pipes. Those
artifacts such as unidentifiable pieces of glass and metal that cannot be specifically placed in one
of the above major categories are classified as Indeterminate.

NRHP ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places are codified under the authority of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set
forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any
resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a “historic
property.” Federal regulations state that “The term ‘eligible for inclusion in the National
Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior
and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2 [e]).
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, the
following four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
Part 60.4 (a–d)].

24

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to meet to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

This chapter presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed Congo #1H project on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management considerations
and recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the final chapter.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Review of THC records indicated that five previous cultural resources investigations have been
conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area. Five archeological sites and one
historic period cemetery have been documented within the search radius. Archival research
focused on the historic period settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Congo #1H project
areas. The 1863 von Rosenberg map of the Sabine River valley indicates that the current route of
FM 3172 follows the River Road. In addition, the agricultural fields associated with the Bosey
farmstead previously occupied the location of Alternative #1 and the Williamson farmstead was
located to the southeast of the project areas along River Road. In the early twentieth century,
Perminter’s Store was located along FM 3172 at the approximate location of Alternative #1, as
evidenced by the 1937 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Sabine National Forest
1:126,000-scale topographic map. By the mid-twentieth century, several primary structures
existed along FM 3172, as depicted on the 1944 United States Geological Survey (USGS)
Logansport 15-minute (1:62,000-scale) topographic map. Interestingly, the 1952 Army Map
Services aerial photography for this area indicates that many of the structures depicted on the
Logansport topographic map had been removed but new residential and agricultural development
was active in the area by the mid-1960s.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
Three alternatives for the proposed Congo #1H project area were intensively investigated to
determine the presence of cultural resources using a combined technique of systematic visual
reconnaissance and the excavation of screened shovel tests. Investigations adhered to BLM
cultural resources survey requirements pertaining to minimum buffer areas. Approximately 48.5
acres were investigated and 116 shovel tests were excavated as part of this cultural resources
27

survey. These 40-cm-diameter (11.8-in) screened shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm (7.9-in)
levels across the proposed project area, with the final location of each excavation situated to
avoid low-lying, inundated, or disturbed areas and in favor of microtopographic rises and
undisturbed contexts, when possible.

Alternative #1 Survey Results
The Congo #1H Alternative #1 well pad location is situated on a dissected upland terrace of the
Sabine River valley adjacent to the Toledo Bend Reservoir. The topography of the project area is
gently rolling (Figure 3). The vegetation consists of pasture grasses with several scattered
hardwoods across the majority of the project area and a second-growth forest of mixed
hardwoods and coniferous species along the eastern property boundary (Figure 4). Ephemeral
drainage channels extend from south to north along the eastern portion of the project area and
along the western boundary of the survey area. Soils encountered in the majority of shovel test
excavations typically consisted of brown (7.5YR 4/4 and 5/4) fine sandy loam and silt loam to a
depth that typically ranged from 25 to 35 cm below surface (10 to 14 in), underlain by red (2.5YR
5/8) clay loam.

In total, 44 shovel tests were excavated in the Congo #1H Alternative #1 project area (Figure 5).
These shovel tests were placed in transects generally extending northeast to southwest across the
survey area. Shovel tests were excavated to basal clays and ranged from 20 to 60 cm (8 to 24 in)
in depth. One positive shovel test (Shovel Test [ST] 12) was excavated on a slight rise located
north of the proposed project area (Figure 6). This shovel test yielded a single sand-tempered
prehistoric ceramic vessel fragment (i.e., sherd) at a depth between 0–20 cm (0–8 in). The
artifact exhibits a brushed exterior surface treatment and a smoothed interior surface treatment
(Figure 7). The core of the sherd is oxidized and the interior and exterior surfaces display a thin
veneer of oxidation, suggesting that the vessel was fired in reduced environment and removed
from firing while hot (c.f. Tesler 1993). No additional artifacts were recovered in ST 12 or in any
of the eight shovel tests excavated in 10-m (33-ft) intervals around ST 12 and was thus recorded
as Isolate 1. This artifact is probably affiliated with the post-A.D. 1250 Caddo occupation of the
area. Intensive historic-period agriculture documented at this location during the mid-1860s, as
evidenced on the 1863 von Rosenberg map, is likely to have disturbed and eroded any associated
artifacts from this location. As an isolated occurrence of past cultural activity, this artifact is not
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Additional positive shovel tests were encountered near the western corner of the survey area (see
Figure 5). These shovel tests yielded artifacts indicative of an early-to-mid-twentieth-century
rural domestic site. Based on the recovery of these artifacts, site 41SY357 was recorded.

Site 41SY357
Site 41SY357 consists of early-to-mid-twentieth-century domestic and architectural artifacts
recovered in seven shovel tests (Figure 8). While the site is not within the area proposed for the
Congo #1H well pad, it is within the prescribed BLM survey buffer. Site 41SY357 occupies a
relatively level area of approximately 0.15 acres measuring roughly 28 m (92 ft) north-to-south
by 27 m (88 ft) east-to-west at an elevation of approximately 205 m (672 ft) amsl. The site is
covered by pasture grasses with no surface visibility (Figure 9). The margin of the terrace
occupied by the site has been agriculturally contoured for erosion control (see Figure 8). A
modern fenceline parallels FM 3172 to the southwest of site 41SY357. No shovel testing was
conducted within the FM 3172 right-of-way, which was constructed below the natural grade of
the landscape and has been largely disturbed by underground utilities. Although the southwestern
boundary of site 41SY357 was not completed delimited, it is unlikely that undisturbed portions of
the site exist in the FM 3172 right-of-way.
Soil profiles examined during shovel testing indicate that the site is situated on an area of brown
(7.5YR 4/3) silt loam and fine sandy loam, to a depth of approximately 40 cm (16 in), overlying
red (2.5YR 5/8) clay loam. The artifact assemblage encountered at site 41SY357 (n=21; Table 5)
consists of twentieth century domestic and architectural materials.
Domestic artifacts
encountered at the site include colorless (n=6), ash-tint (post-1915; n=4), milk glass (n=2), and
amber (n=1) container glass fragments. Two of the colorless glass fragments are identifiable as
machine-made, continuous-threaded lip canning jar fragments (post-1919). The single ash-tint
glass jar basal fragment recovered at the site bears the embossed J-in-keystone mark of the Knox
Bottle Company indicating that it was manufactured in Jackson, Mississippi, between 1932 and
1953 (Toulouse 1971:271). Architectural elements consist solely of wire nails (post-1880; n=8).
The majority of the artifacts recovered at site 41SY357 (n=18; 86%) were encountered within the
upper 20 cm (8 in) of the subsurface while the remaining sample (n=3; 14%) was recovered
between 20 and 40 cm (8 and 16 in). No intact features were encountered either on the surface or
in shovel tests.
Site 41SY357 likely represents the remains of a sheet midden deposit associated with a rural
general or grocery store. A primary structure depicted in this vicinity on the 1937 USDA Sabine
National Forest topographic map is labeled as “Perminters Store.” The relatively small scale of
this map prohibits the determination of a precise location for this structure. Archival research
suggests that this is the location of a general or grocery store owned and operated by Wendell
Smith Permenter (Figure 10), possibly from the 1920s until the early 1940s. Wendell S.
Permenter was the ninth child born to George and Sally Permenter on 3 October 1894. He
appears as “Windell” Permenter in the 1910 Shelby County census as the son of George W.
Permenter. Wendell Permenter married Blanche Hughes on 17 August 1919, and he appears
again in the 1920 Shelby County census as a farmer. Blanche Hughes Permenter died during
childbirth on 7 August 1926 with her newborn. Mr. Permenter later married Flora Fleming on 2
May 1927. He is listed as “Kindell” Permeter in the 1930 Shelby County census and his
occupation is given as a retail grocer. The 1944 USGS Logansport topographic map depicts this
area at a much larger scale with a primary structure depicted in the vicinity of 41SY357;
however, the structure is not labeled, indicating that its operation as a grocery store may have
been defunct by that time. Mr. Permenter died on 8 May 1973 and is buried at the WimberlyRayburn Cemetery.

Given the site’s minimal and fragmentary artifact content, and the lack of cultural features or
architectural remains, site 41SY357 is considered to have little research potential. As such, it is
not likely to preserve information important to understanding community and regional
development in Shelby County during the early-to-mid-twentieth century. Although the site
could not be fully evaluated since it extends outside of the project area, it is unlikely that
significant portions of the site are preserved within the FM 3172 right-of-way. Thus, it is
recommended that 41SY357, as it is currently defined, does not possess the necessary integrity of

design, materials, and association, and therefore does not possess the research potential required
under Criterion D. The site is therefore recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4. The site has been documented and recorded with
TARL. The Alternative #1 location will not be developed for the Congo #1H project and site
41SY357 will not be adversely affected by the construction or maintenance of that infrastructure.
No additional work is recommended at the site as it is presently defined.

Alternative #2 Survey Results
The Congo #1H Alternative #2 well pad location is situated on a prominent escarpment of an
upland terrace of the Sabine River valley adjacent to the Toledo Bend Reservoir. The topography
is generally level across the western portion of the project area (Figure 11) with a distinct northto-south escarpment bisecting the project area (Figure 12) and a level lower terrace or floodplain
in the eastern portion of the project area. The vegetation consists of pasture grasses with several
scattered hardwoods. An unnamed drainage occupies an incised channel along the southeastern
and northeastern edges of the survey area. Soils encountered in the majority of shovel test
excavations on the upper terrace consisted of pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam to a depth
of 50 cm (20 in) overlying pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam mottled with yellowish red
(5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam. Shovel tests excavated on the lower terrace or floodplain to the east
of the upland escarpment exhibited pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam with increasing
redoximorphic staining and concretions with depth.

In total, 58 shovel tests were excavated in the Congo #1H Alternative #2 project area (Figure 13).
Initially, these shovel tests were placed in transects generally extending southwest to northeast
across the survey area. Shovel tests were excavated to basal clays and ranged from 60 to 95 cm
(24 to 37 in) in depth. Four positive shovel tests (Shovel Tests [STs] 4, 5, 8, and 10) were
initially encountered across the survey area. These shovel tests yielded artifacts indicative of
intensive habitation during the Late Prehistoric period, most likely affiliated with the late
prehistoric or protohistoric Caddo occupation of the Sabine River valley. Forty-eight additional
shovel tests were excavated in an attempt to define the boundaries of the site. Based on these
investigations, site 41SY358 was recorded.

Site 41SY358
Site 41SY358 consists primarily of prehistoric ceramic artifacts with a minimal amount of
prehistoric lithic artifacts recovered in 23 shovel tests (Figure 14). The location of the proposed
well pad was changed during the course of fieldwork at this site; therefore, the site boundaries
were not completely delimited. The site occupies a prominent upland terrace escarpment above
an unnamed intermittent stream at an elevation range of approximately 180–204 m (590–670 ft)
amsl. Site 41SY358 encompasses approximately 8.9 acres measuring roughly 280 m (218 ft)
north-to-south by 200 m (656 ft) east-to-west. The site is covered by pasture grasses with no
surface visibility (Figure 15).
Soil profiles examined during shovel testing indicate that the upland terrace is mantled by pale
brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam to a depth of approximately 30–60 cm (12–24 in) where
mottling with reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) fine sandy loam, redoximorphic concretions, and clay
content increases with depth. Below the terrace escarpment, the area adjacent to an unnamed
intermittent stream consists of a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam to a depth of
24 cm (10 in) where it transitions to a brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam and overlies a red
(2.5YR 5/8) sandy clay loam mottled with pale brown (10YR 6/3) redoximorphic concretions
increasing with depth to 80 cm (32 in).
The artifact assemblage encountered at site 41SY358 (n=143) consists of prehistoric ceramics
(n=126; Table 6), prehistoric lithic artifacts (n=14; Table 7), and charred botanical remains (n=3).
Prehistoric ceramic artifacts recovered at site 41SY358 include baked clay (n=8), vessel body
fragments (n=87), vessel neck or shoulder fragments (n=5), vessel rim fragments (n=5), and
indeterminate vessel fragments (n=21). Of the prehistoric vessel fragments recovered at the site,
37 percent (n=44) were primarily sand tempered while bone tempering accounted for 34 percent
(n=40) of the ceramic assemblage. Grog tempering accounted for 13 percent (n=15) and grit
tempering accounted for six percent (n=7) of the ceramic assemblage. Ten percent (n=12) of the
ceramic assemblage recovered from the site was too fragmentary or eroded to definitively
determine the tempering agent. Of the total prehistoric ceramic assemblage, 29 percent (n=34)
were too eroded to adequately determine a decorative motif, if present. An additional 34 percent
(n=39) were plain and exhibited no decoration, with the exception of a single highly polished or
burnished vessel body fragment. Of the ceramic vessel fragments that exhibited surface
decoration, 24 percent (n=28) were brushed (including one with subtle molded ridges), 12 percent
(n=14) were incised, and a single vessel body fragment displayed molded or appliquéd ridges and
a white-slipped interior. Figure 16 illustrates selected prehistoric ceramic artifacts from site
41SY358.

Prehistoric lithic artifacts recovered from site 41SY358 consist almost entirely of chipped lithic
debitage manufactured from undifferentiated local chert (see Table 7). One modified piece of
debitage, recovered in Shovel Test (ST) 52 at a depth of 0–20 cm (0–8 in), may reflect an
expedient cutting tool. One small fragment of non-local granite recovered from ST 8 may
represent a groundstone tool or ornament. Finally, a small slab of unmodified sandstone
recovered from ST 24 is likely to have been transported to the site during its occupation.
Three charred nutshell fragments comprise the only identifiable botanical remains encountered at
site 41SY358. These specimens were encountered in STs 10 and 22 are likely hickory (Carya
sp.) nutshell fragments.
Thirty-seven percent (n=55) of the total artifact assemblage recovered from site 41SY358 was
encountered between depths of 0–20 cm (0–8 in) below surface, while the majority of the sample
(n=69; 48%) was encountered between 20 and 40 cm (8 and 16 in). A minor amount of the total
site assemblage (n=19; 13%) was recovered at depths between 40 and 60 cm (16 and 24 in). No
intact cultural features were encountered either on the surface or in shovel tests.
Site 41SY358 likely represents the remains of a Late Prehistoric Caddo hamlet or village site
occupied post-A.D. 1250. None of the artifacts recovered during this survey effort are clearly
diagnostic to particular type varieties recognized from more intensively excavated sites in the
region; thus, determining a more precise date of site occupation is difficult. The site is likely to
extend to the west and northwest across the upland terrace. These areas were, however, outside
of the Alternative #2 project area and were not investigated during this survey effort. During the
course of this survey, the location of the proposed infrastructure was shifted to the Alternative #3
location. The boundaries of site 41SY358 were therefore not completely delimited. The
Alternative #2 location will not be developed for the Congo #1H project and site 41SY358 will
not be adversely affected by the construction or maintenance of that infrastructure. Thus, no
additional work at this site is recommended at this time. Site 41SY358 has been documented and
recorded with TARL. The site has yielded a variety of prehistoric ceramic artifacts and may have
to potential to contribute important information regarding the Caddo occupation of the middle
Sabine River valley. Agricultural contouring for erosion control has likely disturbed some
portions of the site; however, the integrity of the site has not been comprehensively evaluated.
Thus, it is recommended that site 41SY358, as it is currently defined, is of unknown eligibility for
inclusion on the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4.

Alternative #3 Survey Results
Alternative #3 is situated primarily within a narrow, low terrace adjacent to an unnamed
intermittent tributary of the Sabine River with a portion of the project area extending to the east
and south along the toe-slope of the upland terrace. The topography of the project area is
generally level with a gentle rise along the southeastern and southwestern margins of the project
area (Figures 17 and 18). The vegetation consists of pasture grasses with a riparian corridor of
mixed hardwoods in the northern corner of the survey area and a mixed pine-hardwood forest
along the southeastern and southwestern margins of the survey area. Ground surface visibility
was minimal across much of the project area; however, a rise in the southwestern portion of the
project area was devoid of vegetation and afforded excellent surface visibility. An intermittent
drainage channel extends across the northern corner of the survey area. Soils encountered in the
majority of shovel test excavations typically consisted of brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam and

silt loam to a depth that typically ranged from 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 in) below surface, underlain
by dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam mottled with brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam. Shovel tests
excavated along the toeslope of the upland terrace escarpment indicated a highly eroded
landscape, with red basal clay subsoil encountered at depths of 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in).
In total, 14 shovel tests were excavated in the Congo #1H Alternative #3 project area (Figure 19).
These shovel tests were placed in transects generally extending southwest to northeast across the
survey area. Shovel tests were excavated to basal clays or fragipan and ranged from 10 to 80 cm
(4 to 31 in) in depth, with more shallow depths occurring along the margin of the upland toeslope.
No artifacts were encountered on the surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated within the
proposed Congo #1H Alternative #3 project area. This cultural resources survey encountered no
cultural resources, as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, at this location. The proposed Alternative #3
area project holds a very low probability of containing significant cultural resources and is the
preferred location for the construction of the proposed Congo #1H infrastructure.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This cultural resources survey was conducted to document and assess cultural resources within
three alternative locations proposed for the Congo #1H well pad and associated lease road. A
total of 48.5 acres were surveyed for the proposed project to provide adequate and relevant
information for use in the management of cultural resources within the project area. Five
previously recorded prehistoric archeological sites and one historic-period cemetery are located
within the vicinity of the proposed project area (see Table 4). This cultural resources survey
resulted in the excavation of 116 shovel tests and the documentation of archeological sites
41SY357 and 41SY358. Neither of these sites will be adversely affected by the Congo #1H
project, as it is currently proposed.
Site 41SY357, the former location of an early-to-mid-twentieth century general store, is located
within the prescribed BLM cultural resources survey buffer area of the Congo #1H Alternative #1
location. Given the site’s minimal and fragmentary artifact content, and the lack of cultural
features or architectural remains, site 41SY357 is considered to have little research potential. As
such, it is not likely to preserve information important to understanding community and regional
development in Shelby County during the early-to-mid-twentieth century. Although the site
could not be fully evaluated since it extends outside of the project area, it is unlikely that
significant portions of the site are preserved within the FM 3172 right-of-way. Thus, it is
recommended that 41SY357, as it is currently defined, does not possess the necessary integrity of
design, materials, and association, and therefore does not possess the research potential required
under Criterion D. The site is therefore recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4. The site has been documented and recorded with
TARL. The Alternative #1 location will not be developed for the Congo #1H project and site
41SY357 will not be adversely affected by the construction or maintenance of that infrastructure.
No additional work is recommended at the site as it is presently defined.
Site 41SY358, a late prehistoric Caddo hamlet or village site, is located within the proposed
Congo #1H Alternative #2 location. None of the artifacts recovered during this survey effort are
clearly diagnostic to particular type varieties recognized from more intensively excavated sites in
the region; thus, determining a more precise date of site occupation is difficult. The site is likely
to extend to the west and northwest across the upland terrace. These areas were, however,
outside of the Alternative #2 project area and were not investigated during this survey effort.
During the course of this survey, the location of the proposed infrastructure was shifted to the
49

Alternative #3 location. The boundaries of site 41SY358 were therefore not completely
delimited. The Alternative #2 location will not be developed for the Congo #1H project and site
41SY358 will not be adversely affected by the construction or maintenance of that infrastructure.
Thus, no additional work at this site is recommended at this time. Site 41SY358 has been
documented and recorded with TARL. The site has yielded a variety of prehistoric ceramic
artifacts and may have to potential to contribute important information regarding the Caddo
occupation of the middle Sabine River valley. Agricultural contouring for erosion control has
likely disturbed some portions of the site; however, the integrity of the site has not been
comprehensively evaluated. Thus, it is recommended that site 41SY358, as it is currently
defined, is of unknown eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36
CFR 60.4.
No historic properties (i.e., cultural resources eligible for inclusion in or listed on the NRHP) will
be affected by the construction of the Congo #1H well pad or its associated lease road. Given the
lack of cultural resources in the proposed Alternative #3 project area, it is recommended that
construction of the Congo #1H project be allowed to proceed. Provided the project is carried out
as proposed, no further cultural resources investigations are recommended within the proposed
project area.
