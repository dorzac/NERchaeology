ABSTRACT
Test excavations at 11 sites in Lake Limestone (formerly
Upper Navasota Reservoir) are reported.
The investigations were
carried out by the Texas Archeological Survey during the spring
of 1976.
Eight of the 11 sites were found to be of sufficient
integrity and importance to satisfy eligibility requirements for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
This
report, the Phase II assessment of information-yield potential,
is used as the basis for recommendations that Phase III, inten­
sive investigations, be conducted at 4 of the more significant
sites prior to inundation by the waters of Lake Limestone.

UPPER NAVASOTA RESERVOIR

INTRODUCTION
The Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at
Austin, conducted test excavations at 11 sites within Lake Lime­
stone (under construction) in east-central Texas during the months
of March, April, and May of 1976. This work was done under an
agreement with the Brazos River Authority and represents a con­
tinuation of a systematic program of archeological reconnaissance
and intensive survey (including test excavations) begun in 1974
(Prewitt 1974, 1975). The current work, as well as the previous
investigations, has been coordinated with and accomplished under
procedures established by the Texas Antiquities Committee and the
State Historical Commission. The investigations herein reported
represent the completion of Phase II of this program - the assess­
ment of archeological significance and recommendations for further
actions deemed necessary to resolve conflicts between the con­
struction of Lake Limestone and identified archeological resources.
Lake Limestone (formerly Upper Navasota Reservoir) will be
formed by the completion of Sterling C. Robertson Dam across the
Navasota River in Leon and Robertson counties about 20 miles south­
southeast of Groesbeck and 7 miles northwest of the community of
Marquez.
The impounded waters will inundate portions of north­
eastern Robertson County, northwestern Leon County, and south­
eastern Limestone County. As noted in the two previous reports
dealing with this project, the area lies in the western edge of
the East Texas Timber Belt and just east of the Blackland Prairie
in the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province (Fenneman
1938: 100-102, 108-109). The underlying ge6logy is composed of the
various units of the Wilcox group (Serulards, Adkins, and Plummer
1932: 571-606) and the soils are generally alfisols (Godfrey,
McKee, and Oakes 1973). The floral and faunal assemblage is within
the range ,6f the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950: 100-102).
A total of 52 archeological sites were identified and recorded
during the initial reconnaissance of the project area (Prewitt _
1974). One additional site (4lLT12l) was recorded subsequent to
that survey.
Of this total, 14 have now been found to lie outside
the actual limits of the dam and reservoir boundaries and not sub­
ject to adverse effects of the proposed construction. From the
remaining 39 sites, a total of 14 were recommended for further
testing and/or evaluation. Test excavations at two of these sites,
4lLN20 and 4lRT2, have already been reported (Prewitt 1975). One
site, 4lLT33, should undergo further evaluation in terms of es­
tablishing its project-related effects.
The present report is con­
cerned with the 11 sites tested and evaluated during the current
season of work.
These sites are: 4lLN2l, 4lLN25, 4lLTI2, 4lLT17,
4lLT26, 4lLT32, 4lLT34, 4lLT35, 4lLT42, and 4lLT44.

All notes, photographs, documents, maps, and artifacts were
sent to the Texas Archeological Survey facilities at the Balcones
Research Center in Austin for processing. These materials are
now housed in the Survey facilities and will ultimately be stored
at the Texas Archeological Research Center, The University of
Texas at Austin.

TESTING RESULTS
SUMMARY
The 11 sites examined during this testing program included
10 which were thought to contain significant information-yield
potential and 1 (4lLT26) which was thought, as a result of pre­
liminary inspection, to be shallow and badly disturbed.
This was
done in order to maintain a check on the observations and assess­
ments made throughout the investigation at Lake Limstone. In­
deed, Site 4lLT26 was found to contain little useful information
beyond the fact that it had been the location of minor prehistoric
occupation.
Negative results were obtained from 2 of the other 10 sites.
These 2, 4lLT14 and 41LT42, were found to be so diffuse and dis­
rupted by natural agencies that little practical information could
be expected to be gained from further investigation.
The remain­
ing 8 sites demonstrated positive potential for contributing sig­
nificantly to the study of prehistory in the Upper Navasota region.
These 8 sites (41LN2l, 4lLN25, 41LT17, 4lLT32, 41LT34, 4lLT35,
and 41LT44) yielded evidence that a range of aboriginal use ex­
tending from late Paleoindian times through the Archaic and into
the post-Archaic times existed.
Some of these sites are small in
area (such as 4lLT34), and others are rather extensive (as is
41LT35).
Not all of the components are represented at each site,
and in some instances it may be possible to isolate specific
assemblages horizontally rather than vertically.
There is some repetition of assemblages among the sites;
therefore, it is recommended that only 4 of the 8 localities need
to be thoroughly investigated in order to obtain a prudent con­
trolled sampling of the prehistoric cultural variability repre­
sented in this area.
Sites 41LN2l, 4lLT17, 41LT34, and 4lLT35 are
felt to best fulfill this need and are strongly recommended for
further intensive excavation.
If for any reason one or more of
I
these cannot be adequately investigated, then one or more similar
sites should be included as part of a mitigation program. These
alternate localities are 41LN25, 41LT12, 41LT32, and 41LT44.
RELATIVE RANKING OF SITES
Discussions about the comparative information-yield potential
of archeological sites are difficult (at best) for the non­
archeologist to understand.
Precise data-return value figures do
not exist in a truly objective sense and consequently it is not an
easy task to communicate abstract values to those who may be more

familiar or comfortable with specific number-value systems.
In
recognition of this communication problem, a relative ranking
system has been devised for the archeological sites at Lake
Limestone in which number values are assigned on the basis of
consistent criteria. The system has a number of faults, but it
expresses relative merits in understandable terms and is there­
fore considered to be a valid representation of archeological
information-yield potential of the various sites.
The "scoring" criteria are divided into 6 categories which
allow a site to score no more than 100 points and which allow
minus scores.
The categores are: 1) site structural integrity
(intactness), 2) horizontal potential, 3) vertical potential,
4) set~ing, 5) time de~th, ~nd 6) bonus. An explanation of each
category is given in the following discussion.
Site Integrity
This reflects the actual observed structural integrity of
definable sites and includes such considerations as post­
depositional erosion, deflation, disruption by machinery, roads
and the like, or whether a site appears to be undisturbed. If
a site seems to be relatively intact, it is given a score of +10;
if it is about half intact and half disturbed, it scores 0; if it
is badly disrupted, it receives a score of -10.
Horizontal Potential
This category is a refinement of the relative measure of site
integrity.
It reflects the apparent potential of a site to con­
tain reasonably discrete horizontal clusterings of cultural debris.
For example, the Archaic-age artifacts may occur within a limited
area of a site while the post-Archaic materials are concentrated
or are limited to an adjacent area. A thin site disrupted by
heavy machinery may still retain an identifiable horizontal sepa­
ration of cultural residues. The scoring is +10 for a site with
good horizontal potential and -10 for poor potential.
Vertical Potential
This category, a second-level refinement of relative site
integrity, includes judgements of the vertical displacement of
cultural debris. A thin single-component site which has been
disrupted may still retain its potential while a thin multiple­
component site which has been disrupted may have little or no
potential for yielding significant vertical data. The scoring is
+10 for good potential and -10 for bad or poor potential.
Setting
Divided into 3 sub-categories. this refers to the specific
physiographic setting of the sites - bottomland. slope, and upland.

TESTING RESULTS

7

Multiple-area or large sites may score in more than one of the
sub-categories,
Since more bottomland and slope sites than upland
sites are to be affected by Lake Limestone. the scoring is weighted
in favor of upland sites in order to insure their fair representa­
tion.
The scoring is +5 for bottomland sites, +10 for slope sites,
and +15 for upland sites.
Time Depth
A 4-part division of the time scale is included in this cate­
gory: Paleoindian~ early-Archaic, late-Archaic, and post-Archaic.
Since single-component sites may yield more discrete information
about artifact assemblages through time, the scoring for this cate­
gory is weighted toward single-component sites regardless of the
time period ~epresented.
The scoring, then, is +20 for 1 component,
+15 for 2 components, +10 for 3 components, +5 for all 4 components,
and 0 for sites which yielded no diagnostic materials.
Bonus
Each site is eligible for a maximum of 20 bonus points. These
additional points are awarded on any outstanding or unusual features
which may be displayed by a site.
For instance, if a site appears
to contain unusually well-preserved faunal remains, or if it con­
tains intact features such as identifiable fire hearths, or if sig­
nificant tools other than projectile points are noted, then bonus
points are given in proportion to the adjudged significance of the
special features.
This system of ranking not only eases the communication problem
between archeologist and non-archeologist, but it also forces the
investigator to apply uniform criteria to each site in order to de­
rive a fair assessment of their relative potential. The scores of
all the sites recorded at Lake Limestone are shown in Table 1. The
14 sites indicated by the letters "OR" are outside the reservoir
margins and were not considered during the testing program.
Of the
remaining 39 sites, only 13 scored above 0; 10 of those 13 sites
have been tested either during the present program or the previous
years' surveys.
One of the sites not tested (4lLT33) is still
under consideration for further evaluation, but its location rela­
tive to the reservoir margin remains uncertain.
A sample of 3'(11%)
of the 27 sites which yielded minus scores were tested; this pro­
vides a basis for judging the validity of the ranking system.
The
testing results confirmed the lack of structural integrity and ge­
neral investigative potential at 4lLT26 and demonstrated a similar
situation at 4lLT14 and 4lLT42.
Two of the 10 tested sites which
scored high in the ranking have been destroyed by dam construction;
excavations at those 2 sites (4lLN20 and 4lRT2) were completed and
reported in advance of this destruction (Prewitt 1975). The re­
maining 8 sites (4lLN2l, 4lLN25, 4lLT12, 4lLT17, 4lLT32, 4lLT24,
4lLT35, and 4lLT44) are considered to be the most potentially in­
formative sites at Lake Limestone.

CONCLUSIONS
TENTATIVE INTERPRETATIONS
Perhaps the first consideration at Lake Limestone should be
"When was the region occupied by aboriginal peoples?" Since
little to no radiometrically assayable material was found in the
test excavations, age estimates must be interpolated from adjacent
regions.
The central Texas region is the best chronologically de­
fined neighboring area which has at least some measure of reason­
able radiometric controls.
Based on similarities of artifact types with central Texas,
the occupations at Lake Limestone range from roughly 7000 to 9000
B.P. (5000 to 7000 B.C.) to about 500 years B.P. (A.D. 1450 to
1500). As an initial step in examining the chronological varia­
tions of use of the Upper Navasota region, the occupations may be
separated into 3 basic divisions: late Paleoindian, Archaic, and
post-Archaic.
There are several problems associated with the
chronology of the Upper Navasota region which will be elaborated
upon in the next sub-section.
For the moment, it is sufficient
to note that the stylistic variations of artifacts are not as yet
amenable to distinct ordering through time within the 3 divisions
mentioned above.
The late Paleoindian occupation of this region was evident in
3 of the 11 sites tested during the present program; these sites
are 4lLT17, 4lLT32, and 4lLT35. A previously tested site, 4lLN20,
yielded similar materials (Prewitt 1975: 18). The materials as­
signable to this occupation (all projectile points) bear striking
resemblance to the recently proposed Circleville Phase of central
Texas (Prewitt 1977), and may reflect a similar economic pursuit
in that there is a noticeable lack of association with the remains
of big game animals.
This suggests an essentially Archaic life
style with a relict Paleoindian lithic technology tradition.
There
are other indications of a diversified economic base as well: 3 of
the sites yielding Paleoindian materials are situated on the slopes
or crests of the valley margin while 1 is situated in the flood­
plain.
This suggests that the sites were chosen in order to ex­
ploit a wide range of habitats rather than narrow spectra within
the environment.
It is indeed unfortunate that tools other than projectile
points which were used during the Paleoindian occupations have not
been isolatable in the present investigations.
It is assumed that
the projectile points indicate some degree of dependence upon
hunting small game, but as noted above there must certainly have
been a heavy dependence upon other food/economic sources.

14

UPPER NAVASOTA RESERVOIR

Another intriguing aspect of the Pa1eoindian occupations
noted thus far is the consistent styles of the projectile points,
Four of the specimens are Angostura or Angostura-like, and 5 are
Plainview or Plainview-like. The significance of this cannot yet
be determined with any reasonable degree of certainty, but this
assuredly warrants further investigations,
The Archaic occupations at Lake Limestone may not have been
more intensive than the previous usage, but the probable duration
of the Archaic (5000 or 6000 years) resulted in a greater number
of sites being used. At least 19 sites yielded artifacts attri­
butable to some portion of the Archaic.
The distribution of the
Archaic sites suggests about an equal preference between up1and/
slope and bottomland locations.
As was suggested for the Pa1eo­
indian occu~ations, this seems to indicate a broad economic base
since a variety of habitats are included within the site locations.
Unquestionably there is a diversity of tools other than pro­
jectile points assignable to the Archaic occupations. Although
precise associationa1 data are lacking, some speculation of general
tool groupings may be made.
The 2 Waoo sinkers and the several
Clear Fork gouges all seem to come from what may be early Archaic
sites; or, at least the sites appear to contain components which
may be that age,
In general, projectile pOint types which may be
associated with the Waoo sinkers and Clear Fork gouges include the
Pa1eoindian styles as well as Archaic types such as Carrollton~
Dawson~ Gower~ Trinity~ and Wells.
Several uses for Waoo sinkers have been proposed; for example,
such functions as net sinkers, bolas stones, and bobbins (for
winding string) have been suggested.
There is some evidence that
Clear Fork gouges most probably functioned as push-planes for wood­
working.
The point is that a greater range of tools which suggests
a more diverse economy/activity sphere can be identified beginning
with apparent early Archaic occupation of the Upper Navasota region.
This diversity continues throughout the Archaic even though
the tool morphology changes somewhat.
The middle Archaic is
vaguely definable on the basis of a few Neohes River~ Pedernales~
and Yarbrough dart points; no other artifact categories can be
confidently assigned to this association at the present time even
though it is felt that such associations do exist.
Based on the quantities of various morphological groups, there
seems to be an increase in the degree of usage of the region in
late-Archaic times although there is not necessarily an increase
in the number of sites utilized.
The artifact association appears
to include dart point styles Edgewood~ Gary~ Godley~ and Kent along
with Bristol bifaces, Gossett gouges, Mineola scrapers (or gouges),
and large bifacia11y chipped drills (or stone awls).
It is
probable that the sandy paste pottery is also included with this
association.
The ceramics would seem to indicate (as previously
suggested) more of a change in cooking/storage habits rather than
a change in the economic base.
The post-Archaic is probably similar to the late-Archaic in
its economic base, but the favored site locations are substantially

CONCLUSIONS

15

biased (2 to 1) toward the bottomlands. This may reflect a shift
in the emphasis placed on certain resources, but the basic tool
kit does not change significantly. Weapons are represented by a
variety of arrow point styles and drills are either made from
otherwise unmodified flakes or from discarded arrow points.
Various miscellaneous bifacially worked pieces and the clay paste
pottery should most likely be included within the post-Archaic
assemblage.
At least 3 exotic classes of items are probably associated
with the post-Archaic occupations. These include an obsidian
flake, a finely worked long narrow triangular biface possibly of
non-local gray chert, and several sherds of very thin, untempered
kaolinite pottery. The origin of the obsidian flake has not been
determined, but it is most assuredly from a non-local source.
The well-made chert biface could be from a number of sources;
conceivably, the parent cobble could have come from gravels with­
in the Lake Limestone area, but this is rather doubtful.
It was
more likely transported from west of the Balcones Fault zone.
The kaolinite pottery is somewhat of a puzzle. The base
material is certainly locally available in abundance.
The sherds
recovered from the investigations are thin, strong, and well
fired,
However, it does not appear that kaolinite ceramics ever
became popular. Possibly the vessels made from this particular
clay were so thin that they were considered to be fragile or
otherwise unsuitable for use.
It could also be possible that the
people living in the Upper Navasota region simply did not have
the need or desire to indulge in the manufacture of kaolinite
ceramics.
For whatever reason, though, it is apparent that this
type of pottery was made at Lake Limestone but it simply did not
gain widespread popularity.
INVESTIGATIVE PROBLEMS
In many ways the study of the archeological remains at Lake
Limestone is frustrating; at the same time, challenging problems
are presented in both the methodological and the interpretive
aspects of investigation.
Some of these problems are outlined
in the following discussion and are suggested as a general guide
to any further investigations,
The first and most traumatic problem one encounters in
archeological sites in the Upper Navasota region is the vertical
mixing of artifact assemblages. Many of the sites which have
little vertical extent have been bulldozed clear of timber in
recent years.
This type of heavy machinery activity results in
churning of the unconsolidated surface deposits; consequently,
even tenuously identifiable associations are disrupted.
Excava­
tions gain little more than a subsurface "surface " collection of
objects which mayor may not belong to a discrete interpretive
assemblage.
Site 4lLT26 is a classic example of this situation.

16

UPPER NAVASOTA RESERVOIR

The deeper sites suffer less from recent machine activities
by virtue of greater vertical extent.
However, another factor
comes to the fore at these sites - natural disturbances.
Two
major agencies contribute to natural disturbances in unconsoli­
dated, sandy matrices: plant roots and burrowing animals. The
specific effects of plant root growth and decay are difficult to
identify in the field except in cases where relatively recent
stumps and/or root systems are present. Animal burrows are more
readily identifiable and therefore the burrowers bear the brunt
of the investigators' wrath.
The culprit is most often the
pocket gopher which seems to delight in constructing small caches
of assorted prehistoric objects.
Obviously more mobile than
plant roots, pocket gophers have the ability to shuffle objects
vertically as well as horizontally.
The long range effect of these agencies on the vertical
distribution of artifacts has been discussed by Brown (n.d.).
Assuming a stable surface (i.e' 3 non-agrading and non-eroding),
a false stratigraphy should ensue in which the greater total
percentage of artifacts should rest near the surface with cor­
responding lesser total percentages of objects occurrring at in­
creasing depths.
Theoretically, the longer an object rests upon
a stable surface the greater are its chances for downward dis­
placement, and conversely, the shorter time an object rests upon
the surface, the lesser its chances. are for .dis.placement. There­
fore, it follows that a false stratigraphy should develop in which
a greater percentage of the deeper artifacts should be older with
a co-varying increase in percentage of younger artifacts near the
surface.
(The term "false" is used here to mean that any visible
vertical distributions of the artifacts does not reflect the true
point of original deposition of the artifacts.)
The relative
percentages of types of debris within each vertical unit could
consequently be calculated and statistically valid inferences
made about artifact associations through time.
This was the anticipated distribution of prehistoric objects
at the outset of the Lake Limestone testing program. The supposi­
tion was absolutely wrong.
An extreme example is Test Pit 5 at
4lLN25 (Table 2) where the greatest total percentage of all pre­
historic objects is at the bottom of the unit and the least near
the surface.
Obviously the theory is invalid or the geomorphic
situation at Lake Limestone is significantly at variance with
that necessary for the theory to apply.
Suppositions about artifact associations through time may
be made on the basis of comparison with other areas (such as was
done in the previous sub"section).
However, before substantive
interpretations of the prehistoric use through time of the Upper
Navasota region can be made, the nature and effects of post­
depositional re-distribution of artifacts and artifact assemblages.
must be understood.
This can only be accomplished through de­
tailed, concomitant geomorphological and archeological analyses at
selected sites within the region.

The next problem is related to, and hinges upon. the solution
of the previous problem. This involves the definition of the sys­
tem of prehistoric use of the Upper Navasota region.
Substantive
interpretations of use syste~s must be based on definable aggre­
gates of tools and debris isolatable through time.
Inferences re­
garding changes in or stability of exploitive patterns can be made
only after chronologic~l ordering of tool/debris assemblages.
Interpretations suggesting a single system of use and encompassing
the spectrum of tools/debris resulting from thousands of years of
occupation are irresponsible. The general trends suspected at
Lake Limestone have been discussed in the previous sub-section;
unfortunately, these are trends only and are speculative in the
sense that reasonable discrete tool assemblages are inferred but
cannot be substantiated or refined without the detailed analyses
suggested above.
Similarities of the material culture aggregate of Lake Lime­
stone with other investigated areas in similar environments have
been noted previously (Prewitt 1975: 37). Once the systems of
use within the project area have been defined, then the question
of broader cultural affiliations should be pursued and expanded
upon. At the same time, the problems of potential use by peoples
from adjacent regions with different habitats should be explored.
This was touched upon from a different angle in the report on the
initial survey at Lake Limestone (Prewitt 1974: 9-14). The prob­
lem was phrased in terms of cultural influences or interactions
in that report, but should be taken to include the translocation
of either people or ideas, or both people and ideas.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The 1976 testing program at Lake Lim~stone has resulted in
the elimination of 3 archeological sites (4lLT14, 4lLT26, and
4lLT42) from further investigative consideration. The decision
on an additional site (4lLT33) which was recommended for testing
is still in a state of flux since the relationship of that site
to the reservoir margin is unclear. Due to weather conditions
which prevented access during the testing season. the investiga­
tive potential of that site remains undetermined.
Eight other
sites were tested and were found to contain potentially signifi­
cant data relating to the prehistory of the Lake Limestone region;
each of these sites meets the eligibility requirements for nomina­
tion to the National Register of Historic Places. These 8 sites
(4lLN2l, 4lLN25, 4lLT12, 4lLT17. 4lLT32, 4lLT34, 4lLT35, and
4lLT44) represent the entire range of chronology and physiographic
setting which has been recognized thus far at Lake Limestone.
The sample of 8 sites has demonstrated overlapping aspects
of investigative potential. Therefore, it is felt that it is un­
necessary to mitigate the adverse effect of reservoir construction
for the entire sample of sites. After careful consideration of

CONCLUSIONS

19

the character and potential of each of the 8 individual sites, 4
of them have been selected as the primary candidates for more ex­
tensive investigations, These 4 sites are 4lLN2l, 4lLT17, 4lLT34,
and 4lLT35.
It is estimated that approximately 3 weeks of field
work should be spent at each of the 4 sites. This should be fol­
lowed by approximately 9 months of laboratory processing, analysis
and reporting.
The field work should be directed toward deriving the informa­
tion needed to pursue the investigative problems discussed in the
previous sub-section.
Extensive controlled hand excavations are
required at each of the sites; this should be augmented with addi­
tional mapping and machine excavations as needed.
Special atten­
tion must be paid to soil morphology in order to understand the
artifact relations; it is suggested that a geologist or geographer
trained in geomorphology be required as part of the investigative
team.
The laboratory analysis and reporting should go beyond a
descriptive treatment of the investigations. The regional and
inter-areal problems discussed in the previous sub-section should
be dealt with in detail and should result in substantive inter­
pretations of the prehistory of the Upper Navasota region.
It should be noted that if for any reason one or more of the
primary sites are rendered unavailable for investigation, then any
one of the remaining 4 potentially significant sites should be
substituted in order to maintain an adequate level of treatment
for the archeological resources.
It is suggested that the alter­
nate sites be paired with the primary sites in the following
manner: 4lLN2l/4ILN25; 4ILTI7/4lLT12; 41LT34/4lLT44; 4lLT35/41LT32.
A summary of the mitigation plan recommended is as follows:
1. Excavation of 4 sites - 41LN2l, 4lLT17, 41LT34, and
4lLT35;
2. Allocation of approximately 3 weeks field work per
site (a total of 12 weeks field work);
3. Direct special attention to the soil morphology at
each site with a v~ew toward developing regional ex­
planations of soil genesis and soil mechanics as
relatable to site transformations;
4. Allocation of approximately 9 months for laboratory
processing, analysis, and reporting;
5. Inclusion of a synthesis of all archeological inves­
tigations at Lake Limestone in the final report;
6.
Interpretation of the system of prehistoric use of
the Lake Limestone region; and
7.
Interpretation of the role and place of the pre­
historic adaptations at Lake Limestone as compared
to adjacent regions.

THE SITES
Each of the 11 sites tested during the current season is
individually described and discussed in this section. A four­
part format consisting of site descriptions, work accomplished,
artifact associations, and assessment is used to present the
data.
Certain procedural matters remain constant and are not
repeated in the discussion of each site unless there is a sig~
nificant deviation from the norm. Test pits were 1 x 2 m. in
outline and were oriented magnetic north-south as determined by
the use of a Brunton compass, No arbitrary grid systems were
established on the sites; test pits were placed where it appeared
that excavations would yield the most significant information.
Horizontal control was maintained by plotting the location of the
test pits on contour and sketch maps made at each site. Arbi­
trary datum points were established to provide relative vertical
control within each site.
Excavations were in 10 cm. increments
and the soil was passed through 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth.
Artifacts were placed in bags appropriately labelled as to
site, excavation unit, and level within the unit. A rough esti­
mate of the bu~ned rock content of eaehexcavated 1ev~1~wa~made
by tossing the burned rocks into a bucket placed beside the
screen. When each level was completed, the number of handsful
of burned rocks was counted and recorded, then the rocks were
discarded.
Unmodified river pebbles were noted as being present
in general quantities, but no attempt was made to record specific
quantification for them.
Additional excavations were made at some sites with the aid
of a tractor-mounted backhoe. These excavations were for the
purpose of gaining better control over the stratigraphic relation­
ships within the sites. Profile sections were recorded as needed
to show pertinent relationships.
SITE 41LN21
Description
Three distinct areas of artifact concentration were noted at
this site.
Current test excavations were confined to Area A
since Area B was inadvertently covered with spoil from machine
excavation of the dam spillway and Area C was not recommended for
further evaluation.
Site 41LN21 is located on the left (east)
bank of the Navasota River at the downstream end of the spillway
of Sterling C. Robertson Dam, Area A of the site is on a sandy
knoll situated on the south side of a small lateral draw eneering

THE SITES

21

the river immediately below the spillway. Artifacts were ob­
served on the ground surface in an area of about 50 x 100 meters.
A portion of Area A is within an old cleared field; the rest is
covered with dense brush and trees,
The western edge of this
area of the site is actively being eroded by the river and arti­
facts are exposed in the upper portion of the present cutbank of
the channel.
Work Done by the

Surv~y

Five test pits were excavated in Area A; these varied in
depth from 45 cm. to 1 meter,
In each case, excavations were
halted when a morphologically distinct soil horizon was encount­
ered; this horizon consists of a compact fine-grained clay which
is devoid of cultural debris.
One profile face was cleaned and
recorded in the exposed bank of the river.
Random, unplotted
shovel-probes were made to confirm the general depth of deposits
over much of the site.
Arti£act Associations
The artifacts recovered from the excavations at this site
were situated in unconsolidated sandy soils. As stated above,
the vertical occurrence of cultural debris coincides with the
vertical extent of this loose sandy soil.
No culturally related
strata could be discerned within the soil profiles exposed by
excavation of the test pits, Numerous rodent (primarily gopher)
burrows were noted during excavation and again in the exposed
profiless frequent tree root disturbances were also noted.
Occasional artifacts noted in place during the excavations were
observed to be resting in rodent burrows; small concentrations
of pebbles and artifacts were also noted within rodent disturb­
ances.
Because of the homogeneous and unconcolidated nature of the
soil matrix and root/rodent disturbances~ the vertical distribu­
tion of the artifacts is difficult to interpret.
Only 2 of 9
arrow points were found distinctly above the occurrence of dart
points.
Conversely, 9 of 22 dart points were below the distribu­
tion of arrow points; however, 4 of these are from a test pit
where no arrow points were recovered,
Potsherds, normally equated
with the occurrence of arrow points, were dispersed throughout
the vertical extent of the excavations.
In short, no reliable
vertical separation can be seen in the artifact distributions to
indicate sequential cultural use of this area of the site.
A different approach was attempted to see if in fact at
least some vertical provenience could be "factored out." All
artifacts from each level of each unit were lumped together as a
numerical matrix, then were graphed to show percentages by level
within each test pit,
The 3 deeper test pits showed peaks in
Levels 2, 4, and 6 (Levels 7 and 8 in Test Pit 1) while the 2

shallower test pits showed extended peaks from Level 2 through
LevelS.
These peaks mayor may not represent discrete periods
of occupation.
The horizontal distribution of the artifacts recovered from
Area A appears significant to the extent that the primary locus
of all occupations (regardless of time depth) seems to be centered
where the sandy soil is deepest.
This apparent association can
hardly be considered fortuitous.
Presumably, certain unknown
characteristics of the low sandy knoll repeatedly attracted the
prehistoric users to the same spot.
Alternatively, a restricted
portion of the site could have been a special use area (trash
dump?, processing station?) which persisted through time.
Con­
ceivably, restricted areas of deep sandy soil may have been
favored camping areas because of better drainage in wet weather,
or such soils may have been selected because their deep uncom­
pacted nature may have been better suited for the construction of
shelters.
A combination of these last 2 possibilities may very
well be the key to understanding both the horizontal and vertical
distributions of the artifacts.
Assessment
Area A of site 41LN21 contains potential information relevant
to the study of the problems discussed in the preceding section of
this report,
This potential, as well as the potential to contri­
bute substantially to the knowledge of the material culture
assemblage of the Upper Navasota region, is considered to be of
sufficient significance to warrant further archeological investi­
gations at 41LN2l.
This site meets the criteria of eligibility
for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
If
for any reason 4lLN2l is removed from the investigative matrix,
Site 4lLN25 is suggested as an alternative which should provide
similar information.
SITE 4lLN25
Description
This extensive site is situated on the crest and slopes of
a hill projecting into the east side of the Navasota River flood­
plain at Lynn's Bluff (a popular local fishing hole and relic
collecting locality).
It is bounded on the north by the first
unnamed tributary to enter the Navasota floodplain downstream
from the mouth of Mine Creek, on the west by a fossil channel
scar bordering the floodplain, on the southwest by the present
river channel, on the south by a meander scar, and on the east
by a line of hardwood timber covering most of the hill.
The
entire area of the site has been machine-cleared of timber and
is now used for cattle grazing.
The maximum dimensions of the

24

UPPER NAVASOTA RESERVOIR

site are about 250 m. southwest-northeast and 200 m. northwest­
southeast.
It is narrowest at the soutwest end; this portion is
being actively eroded by the present river channel. For con­
venience in discussion, the site is divided into 3 areas which
correspond to 3 lobes of the hill. Area A is the southernmost
and lowest of the 3 lobes and is the portion of the site being
actively eroded by the river.
Area B is the northernmost and
highest of the 3 lobes; this area has been subjected to random
digging by relic collectors. Area C is situated on the central
lobe.
Work Done by the Survey
Six test pits (2 in each area) were excavated to depths
ranging from 20 cm. to 1 meter,
In Test Pits 1 through 4, exca­
vation halted when the weathered surface of the underlying
Eocene clay formation was encountered.
In the deeper soil pro­
files encountered in Test Pits 5 and 6, excavation ceased when a
soil horizon similar to that at 4lLN2l was encountered. Minor
probes into this dense clay suggested a lack of in-place cultural
debris.
Three profile cuts were cleaned and recorded along the
exposed river bank,
These were made both in and outside of recog­
nized exposures of cultural debris at Area A.
Four backhoe
trenches were excavated in and near Area A to gain better control
over variations in soil depth and to isolate the l~mits of concen­
trated cultural debris in that area~
Artifact Associations
As at 4lLN2l, the artifacts at this site were found to lie
within a soil matrix of unconsolidated sand. No internal strati­
graphy relatable to cultural activities could be discerned in the
exposed soil profiles.
Root and gopher disturbances were proli­
fic; artifacts and debris were frequently observed in contexts
suggesting post-depositional transportation as a result of gopher
burrowing.
The vertical distribution of time diagnostic arti;
facts (arrow points, potsherds and dart points) is a repeat of
that at 4lLN2l - all 3 classes of artifacts were found throughout
the vertical extent of the unconsolidated sand.
In an attempt to factor out gross vertical provenience, all
cultural material was graphed by percentage and by level in each
test pit.
The result was similar to that obtained from Site
4lLN21.
In Area A, 3 peaks were noted in Test Pit 5; these were
at Levels 2, 4, and 10 with that at Level 10 representing the
largest percentage by far.
In Area B, a single peak occurs in
Level 4 of Test Pit 1. Two peaks, 1at Le~el 3 Ind 1 at Level 8,
stand out in Test Pit 6. A~eaCTe6tPits 2 and 3 and Test Pit 4
in Area A were too shallow (20-30 cm.) to be of interpretive
value.
If the peaks do indeed represent major occupational
periods, then there is no apparent uniformity between the excava­
tion units nor the site areas,

Horizontal distributions of the artifacts appears to be
significant to the extent that only a few flakes and burned
rocks occurred in Area C,
The heaviest prehistoric utilization,
then, is concentrated in the 2 most separated areas of the site.
As at 4lLN2l, this intensity of occupation corresponds to the
deepest areas of sandy soil. and a similar set of alternative
explanations for this may be invoked.
Assessment
Site 4lLN25 does contain potential information which may be
of significance to the prehistory of the Upper Navasota region.
However, since the apparent information potential is essentially
the same as 4lLN2l, it is suggested that this site be considered
as an alternate and further investigated only in the event that
4lLN2l is not satisfactorily investigated.
Site 4lLN25 fulfills
the requirements for eligibility to be nominated to the National
Reg!8ter of Historic Places.
SITE 4lLT12
Description
This large complex site consists of a cluster of 9 distinct
areas of artifact concentrations on the left bank of the Navasota
River at the Old Union Bridge, Areas A through F were recorded
during the original survey; Areas G, H. and I were discovered during
the present testing program.
Area A consists of redeposited cul­
tural debris in the present river channel some 400 m. downstream
from the bridge. Area B is on a slight rise at the northeast end
of the bridge.
The county road from Old Union crosses the eastern
portion of this area.
The parts of this area which have not been
destroyed by the road have been bulldozed to remove much of the
timber.
Area C is across a slough and is about 200 m. north­
northeast of Area B.
It is currently in a plowed field.
Area D
is across a slough and about 100 m. northwest of Area C; it is
about 300 m. north of Area B and is on the inside of the juncture
of 2 sloughs. Area E is about 75 m. north of Area D and is across
the second slough.
Area F is on the same rise as Area D and is
50 m. across a slough to the northwest of Area B. Areas D, E, and
F do not appear to have been significantly disturbed by timber
clearing.
Area G is 100 m. north of Area C and is across a slough
from both Areas D and E.
It is currently in a plowed field which
has been recently cleared of timber.
Area H is across a small
slough to the south of Area C and is adjacent to the county road;
it has been bulldozed,
Area I is about 100 m. across the road
to the southeast from Areas C and H, and \is about 300 m. north­
east of Area B.
Area I is in an improved pasture and has been
badly disturbed,

THE SITES

27

Work Done by the Survey
Eight test pits and 4 backhoe trenches were excavated at
41LT12.
Five of the test pits were distributed over Area B; 1
each were excavated in Areas C, G, and H.
All of the backhoe
trenches were excavated in Area D.
In each test pit excavations
were halted when compact sterile clay was encountered.
The
depth of the test pits varied from 15 cm. in Area H to 60 cm. in
Area B and Area G.
Representative profile sections were cleaned
and recorded at each backhoe trench.
Artifact Associations
The artifacts were restricted in their vertical associations
with distinct soil horizons.
In Areas Band D this horizon con­
sists of a dark brown friable sandy loam which varies from about
40 cm. thick (maximum) in Area B to about 1 m. thick (maximum) in
Area D.
In the other 3 areas tested, Areas C, G, and H, the
artifact-bearing soil horizon consists of a thin (no more than
40 cm.) unconsolidated light brown sand.
No clear vertical sepa­
rations of the diagnostic artifacts can be discerned in any of
the units excavated,
The 2 deeper test pits in Area B show peaks
of all debris combined in Levels 2 and 4 in Test Pit 2 and in
Leve14 in Test Pit 7. All diagnostic artifacts, arrow points,
dart points, and ceramics, are included in these units. The same
holds true for Test Pit 5 in Area C, but only dart points were
recovered in Test Pit 8 in Area G.
The horizontal distributions may be more meaningful. N~
diagnostic artifacts were collected from Areas F, H, and I; how­
ever, dart points only were found in Areas D and G while dart
points, arrow points, and ceramics were recovered from Areas B
and C.
This may simply reflect a longer span of occupation
during the Archaic.
Restricted areas of deep sand containing
artifacts were not as noticeable as at 41LN21, 41LN25, and
41LT17, but there did appear to be similar situations in Areas
Band D.
In particular, the vicinity of Test Pits 2 and 7 in
Area B and Backhoe Trench 1 in Area D seem to be similar in depth
and content even though the soil is not as loose and sandy as
at the other sites.
Assessment
Areas Band D at 41LT12 may contain deposits of sufficient
integrity to warrant further investigations. Areas E and F were
not tested, but their deposits appear to be shallow and very
thinly distributed.
The other 5 areas of the site are too dis­
rupted to yield meaningful information.
Eligibility requirements
for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places are
met by Areas Band D at 41LT12.
It is suggested that this site
be considered an alternate to investigations at Site 41LT17.

UPPER NAVASOTA RESERVOIR

28

SITE 4lLT14
Description
This site is located at the base of the hill slope on the
right (west) margin of the floodplain of the Navasota River.
It
is immediately west of Clear Lake in heavily vegetated deep un­
consolidated sand.
Clear Lake is one of a series of meander scars
in this portion of the river valley.
The site is bordered on the
south and west by barbed wire fences, on the east by Clear Lake,
and the north by a low moist area.
A small erosional gully enters
Clear Lake in the northern portion of the site.
The site vicinity
is a popular local fishing camp and modern debris is scattered
about the site.
Evidence of digging for artifacts was noted
along the margins of the erosional gully,
Work Done by the Survey
Three test pits were excavated near the center of the site,
Test Pits I and 2 extended to 160 and 170 cm. respectively and
were abandoned when they were considered unsafe for continued ex­
cavations.
Test Pit 3 extended to 40 cm, and was abandoned due to
a lack of artifactual debris.
Artifact Associations
The cultural debris at this site is thinly distributed
throughout the deep, unconsolidated, light-brown sand. Vertical
stratigraphy consists only of faint variations in soil horizons;
no cultural stratigraphy was noted.
The artifact distributions
reflect this lack of variation; ceramic sherds were found along
with or below dart points; no arrow points were found in the
excavations,
The total debris density peaks at about l:m. in
each of the 2 deeper test pits; the overall vertical distribu­
tions are relatively evenly curved indicating that post­
depositional movement by burrowing animals and/or roots may best
explain the apparent mixing and depth of debris.
The horizontal distributions of the artifacts is little more
informative.
There seems to be a slight concentration of debris
near the center of the site, but this does not appear to coincide
with restricted areas of deep sand as noted at other sites.
Assessment
No apparent meaningful horizontal or vertical artifact
associations could be established at this ~ite.
It is concluded
that there is a lack of significant data present and that no
further investigations are warranted,

THE SITES

29

SITE 4lLT17
Description
This small site is located on the right (west) bank of the
Navasota River about 200 m. downstream from a large power line
which crosses the central portion of the reservoir,
It is on a
slight rise about 400 m. upstream from the mouth of a small
branch which enters the river above the mouth of Blains Creek.
The sandy knoll and the entire area surrounding it has been
cleared of timber and is presently used for pasture.
The site
is bounded on the north by a filled channel scar, on the west
by a shallow unnamed branch, on the south by a low area leading
to the river, and on the east by the present river channel.
Active erosion by the modern river has exposed a vertical sec­
tion of the site and has undoubtedly removed substantial portions
of the original site area.
The observed surface extent of the
site covers an area about 100 m, long (parallel to the river) and
about 15 m. wide,
Work Done by the Survey
The artifacts recovered from the test pits were contained
within a stratum of uneonsolidated dark brown sand. A pebbly
transition zone about 20 cm. thick was observed to overlie the
compact yellow clay in all units except Test Pit 1. No culturally
related stratification could be discerned within the sandy arti­
fact-bearing deposits. A lens of light-colored silt was observed
in the upper portions of Test Pit 1. Numerous rodent burrows
were noted throughout the sandy matrix.
Despite the apparent rodent disturbances and the loose sandy
matrix. this site appears to contain the best potential for de­
finable vertical artifact stratigraphy.
In Test Pits 1 and 3
arrow points and pottery occur distinctly above dart points. A
single sherd was found near the bottom of Test Pit 4.
However,
arrow points, ceramics, and dart points were found to be tho­
roughly mixed in Test Pit 2.
This may reflect the apparent heavier
use of the site in the vicinity of Test Pit 2 as reflected by a
greater density of artifacts and debris,
The vertical distributions of all artifacts and debris sug­
gests that 3 peaks 'of denl!Jit,}1 occur in Test Pits 3 and 4.
The
lower peak in Test Pit 3 extends through 3 levels and may repre­
·gent a compaction of the lower 2 peaks noted in Test Pits 1 and
2.
These peaks of density may be relatable to the occurrence of
3 groups of time-diagnostic artifacts: post-Archaic arrow points
and ceramics, Archaic dart points, and late Paleoindian dart
points.
It may be argued that the Paleoindian age projectile
points were picked up and re-used by later peoples, but the
quantity and material of manufacture suggests an in situ Paleo­
indian occupation,

30

UPPER IVA VASOTA RESERVOIR

No significant age-related variations were noted in the hori­
distributions of the artifacts.
The major aspect of the
horizontal distributions is the apparent higher density of occupa­
tional debris near the center of the site at Test Pits 1 and 2.
This does not correspond with dramatic changes in sub-surface
features as at 4lLN2l and 4lLN25.
zonta~

Assessment
Site 41LT17 exhibits excellent potential for yielding useful
information about the chronology and other aspects of the material
culture assemblage in the Upper Navasota region,
The long-term
use and the physical location of the site contribute to its sig­
nificance; it warrants further extensive investigations. This
site meets the requirements for eligibility to be nominated to
the National Register of Historic Places.
If it is removed from
the investigative matrix for any reason. Site 41LT12 should be
substituted to provide similar data,
SITE 41LT26
Description
Two areas of occupation were noted at this site situated on
the right (west) side of the Navasota River valley between
Blains Creek and an unnamed tributary entering the river just
downstream from 41LT17. Area B is situated on a low knoll adja­
cent to Blains Creek and was not recommended for further testing.
Area A is on another low knoll adjacent to the unnamed tributary
and is about 300 m. south of 41LT17.
Surface indications con­
sisted of thinly scattered chipping debris. All of Area A has
been cleared of timber; this resulted in the apparent churning
of the surface deposits.
Work Done by the Survey
A single test pit was excavated to a depth of 40 cm. below
surface.
Due to the ephemeral nature of this site and its ap­
parent lack of integrity~ no measured map wa& made; instead. an
unmeasured sketch was substituted.
Artifact Associations
v, .
Very little can be said about the artifacts from this site.
VerticallYt all the artifacts were contained in a gray friable
sandy loam matrix which overlay dense mottled brown clay. The
top 15 to 20 cm. of the sandy loam are heavily disturbed by ac­
tivities associated with timber clearing. A majority of the
cultural debris (including the single dart point and potsherd)

THE SITES

31

was encountered immediately below the heavily disturbed surface
deposits. A substantial percentage of burned rock continued
below the chipping debris to the top of the dense clay. No
horizontal comparisons can be made since only 1 test pit was
excavated.
Assessment
Site 4lLT26 is considered to be of insufficient integrity
and to contain insufficient information-yield potential to merit
further archeological investigations.
SITE 4lLT32
Description
This site is located on the right bank of the Old Navasota
River channel near the end of a ridge jutting northward into the
river floodplain.
Area A is on the east slope of a high knoll at
the north end of the ridge which rises westward from Water Lake.
Over half of the knoll, including the site area, has been bull­
dozed to clear the timber.
Area B is located due south of Area A;
it is across a low saddle and is on the north slope of a knoll
slightly lower than that at Area A. Most of Area B has been bull­
dozed to elear the timber, but a remnant of wooded area is situated
across a property line fence at the southeast corner of the site.
Rush Lake is situated at the base of the knoll to the west-so~thwest
of Area B; this area is approximately midway between Water Lake
and Rush Lake.
Work Done by the Survey
Three test pits were excavated at 4lLT32; 2 were in Area A
and 1 was in Area B. Test Pit 1 in Area B extended to a depth of
110 cm. where the surface deposits consisting of unconsolidated
sand ceased and dense clay was encountered; this also coincided
with the upper limits of the water table. Test Pit 2, in Area A,
extended to a depth of nearly 160 cm. where dense clay was en­
countered.
Test Pit 3, also in Area A, extended to a depth of
170 cm. where wall slumpage forced abandonment of the unit.
The
bottom of the unconsolidated sand was not reached in this unit.
Artifact Associations
As was anticipated, the artifacts are contained within the
deep unconsolidated sand in both areas of this site. No cul­
turally related stratigraphic separations were observed within the
vertical extent of the unconsolidated sand. Although there is no

32

UPPER NAVASOTA RESERVOIR

clear separation, there is a general tendency for the arrow points
and pottery to overlie the dart points. When the percentages of
all combined cultural debris are graphed, 3 peaks of concentration
are identifiable in each test pit.
In Test Pit 1, the peaks are
in Levels 2 and 3, 5 through 8, and in Level 10. In Test Pit 2,
the debris peaks in Levels 2 through 6, Level lOt and Level 12.
The peaks are in Levels 2 through 7. 9 through 12. and 14 through
16 in Test Pit 3.
It is of particular interest to note that 2 small Clear Fork
gouges were found in the middle peak in Test Pit 1 (Area B). This
same peak in Test Pit 1 also yielded the 2 fragment~-of late
Pa1eoindian style dart points recovered from this'site.
In addi~
tion, an apparent Edge~ood point occurred with the gouges and
Pa1eoindian materials, and a single Neahes River (1) dart point
was found in the lower peak in Test Pit 1. A total of 25 of the
33 cores from this site were recovered from the combined middle
and lower peaks of this test pit along with a petrified wood bi­
face and 2 biface manufacturing failures; about 1000 of the
slightly more than 2600 flint flakes are also associated with
the 2 peaks; and by far the largest quantities of burned rock are
associated with them. Although it is somewhat speculative, there
seems to be a fairly well defined - or relatively discrete ­
early (1) Archaic component present in this area of the site.
The vertical distribution of the aggregate appears to repre­
sent later Archaic and post-Archaic occupations. Most of the
normally diagnostic artifacts are too fragmentary to allow more
precise interpretations of the chronology. A single handstone
for grinding is of functional significance and may reflect some
sort of economic trend toward greater use of seeds or other vege­
table foods during the later usage of the Upper Navasota region.
Assessment
The information recovered during the testing program sug­
gests that Site 41LT32 may contain information significant to the
understanding of the pr~hf$toric usage of the Upper Navasota
region.
In particular, Area A may contain significant data rele­
vant to possible later economic changes, and Area B may contain
substantial data relating to the earlier usage of the region.
Further' archeological work is warranted.
Eligibility criteria for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places are met by
Site 41LT32.
It should be considered as an alternate selection
if for any reason Site 41LT35 is not investigated.
SITE 41LT34
Description
This small site is only about 30 m. in diameter and is
situated on a slight rise on the east side of the Navasota River

THE SITES

floodlplain.
It is on the left bank of the present river channel
approximately .5 mile upstream from the mouth of Turkey Creek.
The site is on an inside bend of the present river channel which
is about 60 to 80 m. away to the west and to the south.
The
entire area of the site and the surrounding floodplain has been
bulldozed to clear the timber; a few isolated trees remain near
the site.
Thinly scattered cultural debris was noted on the low
rise, particularly near the center.

Three test pits were excavated in 4lLT34.
The depth of the

uniform, unconsolidated, brown, sandy-loam matrix.

...

Associati~ns

.. =t

No vertical stratigraphy was discernible in the unconsolidated
sandy matrix, nor does the vertical distribution of the artifacts
indicate any clear cut stratigraphy.
In general terms, the arrow
points and pottery occur higher than do dart points, but there is
substantial mixture.
Unlike several of the other sites which were
tested, the vertical charts of all cultural debris Eecovered do
not factor out into distinctive peaks of vertical artifact clus­
terings.
Instead, there seems to be a more even distribution which
reaches its greatest density near the bottom of the loose sand and
then drops sharply at the contact with the dense clay.
Perhaps the greatest significance of the artifacts lies not
in their distributions, but in the forms represented.
Specifically,
the arrow points are dominated by the SaaZZorn/Granbury complex,
there are 2 BristoZ bifaces and a flake drill present, and the
dart points are dominated by the Kent and Gary types. The single
PedernaZes dart point may also be of more than passing signifi­
cance,
This range of artifacts seems to indicate some specific
episodes of site usage which can be isolated - middle and late
Archaic, and early post-Archaic ~ despite the apparent lack of
physical stratigraphy.
There may be some variation in the horizontal distributions
to the arrow points and pottery as opposed to the dart points;
all 3 ~ategories were present in Test Pits 1 and 2, but oftlydart
points were recovered from Test Pit 3.
The small overall size of
this site may be ideal for detecting this type of variation and
conceivably could yield some of the most discrete chronological
data obtainable from the Upper Navasota region.
Assessment
Site 4lLT34 is potentially one of the most informative sites
at Lake Limestone.
As such, it is certainly worthy' of further

archeolbgical investigations. National Regiater of Historic
Places ~ligibility r~quirements are met by Site 4lLT34.
If this
site cannot be investigated, then Site 4lLT44 should be considered
as an alternate replacement for data recovery.
SITE 4lLT35
Description
Situated across the Navasota River to the northeast of Clear
Lake, this site exhibits 3 discrete areas of cultural debris. It
is located on the left (east) side of the river valley on a high
sandy knoll on the left (east) side of Spring Creek.
The site is
just up Spring Creek from its juncture with the Navasota River.
Area A is on the highest point of the knoll and is the nearest
part of the site to Spring Creek.
Cultural debris was noted on
the highest part of the knoll and on the west flank sloping to­
ward Spting Creek. Area B is on a slightly lower pOint to the
southeast of Area A; the knoll is more or less a stepped ridge
oriented northwest-southeast with each successive lobe to the
southeast being somewhat lower than the previous lobe.
Thinly
scattered debris was noted on the surface of Area B. A little
further southeast of Area B is a small slight rise near the edge
of the floodplain with sparse chipping debris on the surface;
this waS labelled Area C. All three areas have been bulldozed
clear of timber, but a few trees remain, particularly at Area C.
A barbed wire property line fence is located just off the north­
west edge of Area A.
Work Done by the Survey
A total of 6 test pits were excavated at 4lLT35.
Four are
in Area A, and 1 each are in Areas Band C. The artifacts were
contained within an unconsolidated sandy loam matrix which is
underlain by sterile dense reddish clay.
Excavations in each test
pit were halted when the clay was encountered.
The depth of the
test pits ranges from about 40 to 100 cm.
Artifact Associations
As seems to be the usual case at Lake Limestone, no cultural
stratigraphy was visible within the unconsolidated sandy matrix,
and the vertical distribution of the artifacts is only suggestive
of a general tendency for the arrow points to overlie dart points
(only 2 potsherds were encountered). However, a tendency toward
relatively discrete clusterings of artifact groups can be fac­
tored o~t of the general vertical columns at 4lLT35.
The graphed distributions of all debris and those of general
artifact categories did not seem to show clear peaks as they have
done at other sites.
Consequently, a more detailed breakdown of

UPPER NAVASOTA RESERVOIR

36

artifact classes was attempted to identify possible general verti­
cal clusterings of artifacts. This seems to have been reasonably
successful.
Three gross units of artifact associations emerge in
this tabulation.
Unit 1. the most recent. is characterized by
arrow points and includes all levels of Test Pits 1 and 6, Levels
1 and 2 of T~st Pit 2, and Levels 1 through 4 of Test Pits 4 and
5. No stylistically diagnostic specimens occurred in Test Pit 6,
so it is con$idered to be Unit 1 undifferentiated.
The frequencies of artifacts were plotted in histogram form
to see if any artifact associations could be defined for the ap­
parent styli~tic groupings.
Bifaci.lly chipped stone artifacts
appear to coincide greatest with the general arrow point cate­
gory in Unit 1. Roughly 20 to 40% of all general categories ex­
cept arrow points occur in Unit 2,
The concentration of dart
points in Unit 3 coincides with large percentages of miscella­
neous artifacts and cores.
It seems then, that some sort of ver­
tical groupings of artifacts can be defined in the absence of
visible stra~igraphy.
The general association of Dawson and
Wesley points with miscellaneous Paleoindian, Cappollton, and
Tpinity points may indicate the relative chronological position
as well; they are probably middle- or early-Archaic in age.
The
distribution of the two drills may also be important; the more
carefully and bifacially chipped specimen appears to be associated
with the lIlix'ed arrow point/dart poiQ,t component ,while the flake
drill appears associated with arrow points only.
The ho~izontal distribution of the artifacts suggests that
the earlier occupations were restricted to Areas A and B while the
later usage of the site expanded to Area C with concentrations in
portions of Areas A and B.
Both ceramic sherds were recovered
from Area A,
Assessment
The nature and distribution of the artifacts at 4lLT35 indi­
cates that this site contains significant information relating to
long term usage by prehistoric peoples.
It certainly warrants
further archeological investigations.
Site 4lLT35 meets the eli­
gib,ility criteria for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places.
Site 4lLT32 should be considered as an alternate
selection if for any reason Site 4lLT35. is nat: i'nve$tigated.
SITE 41LT42
Description
Two ar~as of cultural debris were defined at this site which
is located On the end of a narrow ridge situated in the forks of
Big Creek and Pear Branch. Area A is on the last knoll at the end
of the ridge where it slopes down toward the forks of the creeks.

THE SITES

37

Area B is just to the northeast of Area A and is on a more or
less level narrow portion of the ridge. All of the site area
has been bulldozed during timber cl~aring operations. An east~
west fence crosses the approximate center of the site; the area
extending south of the fence is in improved pasture.
Work Done by the Survey
Area A appeared to be the least disrupted portion of the
site; consequently, 3 test pits were excavated in that area and
none were placed in Area B.
The artifacts were contained in un­
consolidated gravelly sand which overlay dense brown and yellow
mottled clay. No artifacts seemed to be in place in the clay,
so excavations were halted in each pit when the clay was encount­
ered.
The depth of the clay varied from nearly 1 m. in Test Pits
1 and 2 to 30 cm. in Test Pit 3.
Artifact Associations
The general distributions of artifacts follow the trend at
the other sites tested at Lake Limestone; the arrow points tend
to occur higher than the dart points although there is consider­
able mixture. The distributional peaks of all debris combined
vary widely among the test pits. Two peaks, one in Levels 1
through 4 and one in Levels 5 through 7, occur in Test Pit 1.
Three peaks can be seen in Test Pit 2: Levels 1 through 4, Levels
5 and 6, and Levels 7 through 9. However, a single peak in
Level 3 is all that is visible in Test Pit 3.
Projectile point styles vary widely and are represented by
only 1 specimen each. Perhaps the only notable aspect of the
projectile points is the presence of a CatahouZa arrow point
which illustrates post depositional displacement of artifacts.
The proximal (basal) half of the CatahouZa point was recovered
from Level 3 (20-30 cm.) of Test Pit 2 while the distal half was
found in Level 6 (50-60 em.) of the same pit.
No significant horizontal variations in the distribution of
the artifacts was noted.
Assessment
The test excavations at Site 4lLT42 indicate that this site
contains no significant information-yield potential beyond that
which has already been recovered.
In light of this, it is felt
that no further archeological investigations are warranted at
this site.

UPPER NAVASOTA RESERVOIR

SITE 4lLT44
Description
Three discrete areas of occupational debris were noted and
tested at this aite.
The site is located on the left (east) side
of the Navasota River floodplain about 3/4 mile north of 4lLT17;
it is just downstream from where Cedar Creek (not named on U.S.G.S.
7.5' quadrangle: Farrar) intersects a complex series of abandoned
river channel scars, the main one of which appears to be a con­
tinuation of Sanders Creek,
The site is actually on the flood­
plain at the base of a long westward sloping ridge. Area A is on
the left bank of the main channel scar (Sanders Creek?) in a
densely wooded area of fairly compact tan clay loam. Area B is
across the channel to the southwest of Area A in a clearing and is
surrounded on 3 sides by the fossil channel scars; the soil is
dense black clay. Area C is about 150 m. downstream (south) from
Area A and on the same side of the channel scar.
It is situated
on a low sandy ridge which has been bulldozed clear of timber.
Work Done by the Survey
A total of 9 test pits and 5 backhoe trenches were excavated
at this site,
Test Pits 1 and 2 are in Area B, Test Pits 3 through
7 and Backhoe Trenches 1 and 2 are in Area A, and Test Pits 8 and
9 and Backhoe Trenches 3 thr ough 5 are in Area C. The depth of the
te st pits varies from 10 to 50 cm.
Artifact Associations
Areas A and B appear to represent usage restricted to Archaic
times. The soil in Area A is fairly compact sandy clay loam as
opposed to the unconsolidated sand at Area C and most of the other
sites in the Upper Navasota region. Area B is composed of dense
alluvially redeposited black clay; the artifacts and debris are
contained primarily in the upper 10 cm. of the clay. A relatively
tight assemblage of projectile point styles - Gary, GodZey, and
Kent - was recovered from Areas A and B. Perhaps the most out­
standing feature of these 2 areas is an apparent stone hearth in
Area B. This feature was flat, approximately 10 cm. thick, and
50 cm. in diameter. A small concentration of chipping debris was
noted about 50 cm. to the north of the burned rocks. Charcoal or
charcoal stain was noted among the burned rocks and was collected;
no attempt to obtain a radiocarbon assay has been made since the
sample is too small to permit splitting for separate assay. A
single dated sample would be meaningless and serve only to obscure
other types of information.
A similar clustering of burned rocks was noted in Area C;
however, this feature was rather diffuse in comparison. Rodent
activity in the loose sand of this area undoubtedly contributed to

THE SITES

the scattering of the stones. No charcoal or charcoal stain was
noted in this rock cluster.
The artifact assemblage at Area C
consists o~ a variety of both arrow point and dart point styles.
Carrollton, Dawson, Gary and Kent dart points are represented by
1 specimen each; a single Granbury and 2 Perdiz arrow points are
present. Perhaps of more significance is the presence of 2
Gossett gouges and a long, slim, triangular, well-made biface
fashioned from possibly non-local light~gray chert.
The rela­
tively large quantity of cores recovered from Area A seems some­
what unusual as well.
As previously stated, only Archaic materials were recognized
in Areas A and B. The vertical distributions of the artifacts
and debris of the test pits exhibit a single frequency peak. No
separation of dart and arrow points can be seen at Area C. The
most significant distributional aspect; then, appears to be the
horizontal separation of the areas utilized which is represented
in both the artifactual and soil contexts.
Assessment
Site 4lLT44 does contain potentially significant information
regarding the prehistoric usage of the Upper Navasota region.
However, since the current testing was fairly extensive, it is
felt that this site should be considered as an alternate selection
in the event that Site 4lLT34 cannot be satisfactorily investi­
gated.
Eligibility requirements for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places are met by Site 4lLT44.

THE ARTIFACTS
The 31,236 artifacts, fragmentsi,and pieces of chipping
debris are divided into 2 major categbrie~ based on parent
material: lithic and ceramic.
These groupings are further
divided into descriptive groups; it should be noted that several
functional appellations are used, these are for convenience only
and should not be construed as implying specific functions of
artifact groups,
Type and variety names are used whenever arti­
facts appear to conform to previously defined categories. Se­
lected references are provided for the named types of artifacts.
In order to eliminate repetition and to pare the length of
this report, detailed descriptions of each grouping are not pre­
sented. An abbreviated format is used and descriptions are sup­
plied only where necessary_
See Table 2 for the distribution of
artifacts by site.

CERAMICS

Varies from untempered kaolinite to bone and clay lumptem~
per. The 4 rim sherds are straight to slightly everted with
rounded lips. One rim sherd exhibits a portion of an open tri­
angular incised design.
Three body sherds exhibit design frag­
ments; 1 consists of 3 parallel incised lines, 1 is an open
rectangular incised design, and 1 is brushed. One sherd appears
to be a basal fragment.
Sandy Paste (28

spec~mens)

A single sherd of this group exhibits tempering. This rim
sherd has tiny flecks of bone scattered through it. The rim is
straight and the lip is flat and notched.
Three other rim
sherds are essentially straight but are everted very slightly;
the lips are rounded but have been thinned on the interior. Ex­
cept for the notched rim sherd, no decorations are exhibited.
Sand/Clay Paste (12 specimens)
One of 2 rim sherds is the only specimen in this group which
exhibits tempering - both bone and sherd.
This specimen has an
open rectangular incised design; the other is plain. Both rims
are straight with rounded lips thinned on the interior.
Burned Clay
Untallied fragments of burned clay were recorded as either
present or absent for each site.
NON-ARTIFACT DEBRIS
Bone
Untallied fragments of various animal bones are included in
this category; some are burned, some appear to be recent, and
many are rodent-gnawed. Most of the fragments are unidentifiable;
the more complete pieces appear to be from deer and rodent size
animals.
Tabulations indicate either presence or absence of both
burned and unburned categories.
