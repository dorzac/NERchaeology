MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 16 and 19 November 2010, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed 15.0-acre Manor Independent
School District (ISD) tract in Travis County, Texas (Project Area). Because Manor ISD is a
political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). Additionally, the development of the Project Area may utilize a
Nationwide Permit (NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As such, the
undertaking also would be regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. On behalf of Manor ISD, Hagood Engineering Associates, Inc.
(Hagood) contracted with Horizon to conduct the intensive cultural resources survey of the
Project Area. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit
number 5806 in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
cultural resources were located within the Project Area and, if so, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
A strip of land along the Project Area’s entire western boundary has been designated a
100-year floodplain. Shovel tests conducted within this floodplain revealed exposed bedrock
and shallow soils, but no deep alluvial soils that may contain deep cultural deposits. Based on
these data, it is Horizon’s opinion that the Project Area within the 100-year floodplain does not
warrant further investigation, either through intensive surface inspection, shovel testing, or
mechanized trenching.
The cultural resources survey also included a systematic examination of site 41TV1709,
which is a previously recorded historic cemetery located north of the Project Area’s northern
boundary. No development is proposed for areas within 22.9 m (75.0 ft) of the marked southern
boundary of site 41TV1709.
Finally, the cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of 1 historic
farmstead (site 41TV2389). Based on archival evidence and the site’s general lack of integrity,
site 41TV2389 is considered ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and/or for designation as an
SAL.
Based on the results of the intensive cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the currently proposed design for the development of the Manor ISD tract would pose no
adverse impacts to significant cultural resources. Therefore, Horizon recommends that cultural

resources clearance be granted for the undertaking. In the unlikely event that future
development plans are found to impact areas within 22.9 m (75.0 ft) of the marked southern
boundary of site 41TV1709 (the historic cemetery), then Horizon recommends mechanical
scraping of those affected areas to determine if any unmarked graves are located outside the
visible boundaries of the cemetery and within the Project Area. Furthermore, if any cultural
materials are inadvertently discovered at any point during the development of the Project Area
(even in previously surveyed areas), all work at the location of the find should cease
immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the
proposed 15.0-acre Manor Independent School District (ISD) tract located in northern Travis
County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 and 2). Because Manor ISD is a political subdivision of
the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
Additionally, the development of the Project Area may utilize a Nationwide Permit (NWP) issued
by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As such, the undertaking also would be
regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. On behalf of Manor ISD, Hagood Engineering Associates, Inc. (Hagood) contracted
with Horizon to conduct the intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area. The survey
was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 5806 in compliance
with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were
located within the Project Area and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as State Archeological Landmarks
(SALs).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Reymundo Chapa served as principal investigator and field investigator for the project.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 16 and 19 November 2010. This
consisted of an intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing within the Project
Area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres on projects between 11.0 and 100.0 acres in size. As
such, the 15.0 acres comprising the Project Area required a total of 8 shovel tests in order to
comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by conducting 12 shovel tests within
the Project Area.
A strip of land along the Project Area’s entire western boundary has been designated a
100-year floodplain. Shovel tests conducted within this floodplain revealed exposed bedrock
and shallow soils, but no deep alluvial soils that may contain deep cultural deposits. Based on
these data, it is Horizon’s opinion that the Project Area within the 100-year floodplain does not

warrant further investigation, either through intensive surface inspection, shovel testing, or
mechanized trenching.
The cultural resources survey also included a systematic examination of site 41TV1709,
which is a previously recorded historic cemetery located north of the Project Area’s northern
boundary. No development is proposed for areas within 22.9 m (75.0 ft) of the marked southern
boundary of site 41TV1709.
Finally, the survey of the 15.0-acre Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1
historic farmstead (site 41TV2389) consisting of 2 concrete stave silos, 1 water trough, 1
collapsed barn-like structure, and 1 gravel pit. Based on archival evidence and the site’s
general lack of integrity, site 41TV2389 is considered ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and/or
for designation as an SAL.
Based on the results of the intensive cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the currently proposed design for the development of the Manor ISD tract would pose no
adverse impacts to significant cultural resources. Therefore, Horizon recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the undertaking. In the unlikely event that future
development plans are found to impact areas within 22.9 m (75.0 ft) of the marked southern
boundary of site 41TV1709 (the historic cemetery), then Horizon recommends mechanical
scraping of those affected areas to determine if any unmarked graves are located outside the
visible boundaries of the cemetery and within the Project Area. Furthermore, if any cultural
materials are inadvertently discovered at any point during the development of the Project Area
(even in previously surveyed areas), all work at the location of the find should cease
immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of a 15.0-acre tract located west of East Braker Lane, north of
Pioneer Farms Drive, and east of Walnut Creek in north Travis County, Texas. Its location can
be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’ Austin East, Texas, topographic quadrangle
(see Figure 1). The Project Area is the proposed location of a 1-story elementary school and its
adjacent constructions. Currently, the Project Area is a heavily wooded ridge that contains
remnants of outbuildings and structures that are usually associated with farmsteads associated
with site 41RV1709, which represents the remains of a historic-age farmstead or homestead.
However, there is no evidence of any livable structure, either extant or razed, on the site.
Photographs of the general property are provided in Figures 3 through 8.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located on a ridge that overlooks Walnut Creek along the western
periphery of the Project Area. Elevations range between 196.6 meters (m) (645.0 feet [ft])
above mean sea level (amsl) in the northeast to 182.9 m (600.0 ft) amsl in the west. The
Project Area drains from east to west into Walnut Creek. In turn, Walnut Creek flows south and
eventually empties into the Colorado River approximately 12.0 kilometers (km) (7.5 miles) south
of the Project Area.
A strip of land along the Project Area’s entire western boundary has been designated as
a 100-year floodplain (Figure 9). A marked change in vegetation occurs within this floodplain,
where trees transition from predominantly chinaberry (genus Meliaceae) and hackberry (genus
Celtis) to live oak (genus Quercus) and cedar (genus Pinaceae). The physiography and ground
conditions also change from a relatively flat topography and silty clays in the eastern portion of
the Project Area to exposed bedrock, shallow gravely loam, and deeply carved drainage
channels in the western portion of the Project Area (see Figures 6 to 8). No evidence of deep
alluvial material was found within this portion of the Project Area.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

A review of existing literature shows that the Project Area is underlain by the Navarro
group, Quaternary high terrace deposits, and Quaternary alluvial deposits (Proctor et al. 1981).
The Navarro geologic group is composed of calcareous clay and marl. Both the Corsicana and
Kemp geologic formations are included in the Navarro Group. The Corsicana Formation
achieves a maximum thickness of approximately 36.6 m (120.0 ft). It is dark gray or brown in
color, and quartz siltstone is common between the Corsicana and the bottom of the Kemp
Formation. The maximum thickness of the Kemp Formation is approximately 106.7 m (350.0 ft).
Quaternary high terrace deposits are described as unconsolidated gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
Quaternary alluvial deposits consist of unconsolidated sand, silt, gravel, clay, and cobbles
(Garner and Young 1976).
A total of 4 soil types are mapped within the 15.0-acre Project Area. These soils are
described below (Table 1; Figure 10), and with views of typical shovel tests (Figures 11 and 12).

In general, the geomorphological conditions that prevail within the Project Area suggest
that any cultural resources would be constrained to the modern ground surface or in erosional
settings that lack integrity, rather than in buried contexts. Erosion processes are typical of the
Project Area, and no deep alluvial sediments with the potential of containing buried, intact
archeological deposits are mapped therein. All things being equal, any cultural resources
associated with the soils mapped in the Project Area would be expected to occur on the modern
ground surface in deflated, eroded contexts that lack stratigraphic integrity.

VEGETATION

The Project Area is situated within the Blackland Prairie vegetational area of Texas
(Gould 1975). Vegetation is dominated by scrubby woodlands, of which honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa) is the dominant species. Other vegetation observed throughout the
subject site includes giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), prickly
pear (Opuntia lindheimeri), frostweed (Verbesina virginica), Tasajillo cactus (Opuntia
leptocaulis), and southern dewberry (Rubus trivialis). Several drainage associated on-channel
stock ponds and upland stock ponds are located within the Project Area. Within these areas the
vegetation most often includes black willow (Salix nigra), fiddle dock (Rumex pulcher), water
primrose (Ludwigia sp.), rattlebush (Sesbania drummondii), spikerush (Eleocharis sp.),
flatsedge (Cyperus sp.), arrowhead (Sagittaria platyphylla), bulrush (Scirpus sp.), spiny cocklebur (Xanthium spinosum), frog-fruit (Phyla sp.), balloon vine (Cardiospermum sp.), southern
dewberry (Rubus trivialis), and various sedges (Carex spp.).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400 BP;
and Historic, 400 BP to ca. present. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented
below.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 B.P.)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to also have been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 B.P.)

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1400 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar
transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.
Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
did the Paleo-Indian groups.
3.2.1

Early Archaic (8000 to 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
Paleo-Indian lanceolate-shaped projectile points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the
Early Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed
that, prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable
in terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyonlands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. Among others, McKinney (1981) has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared during the Late Paleo-Indian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).
3.2.2

Middle Archaic (5000 to 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites, such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way during the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens
(Collins 1995). These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different
subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive

16

100144_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 15.0-Acre
Proposed Manor Independent School District Tract, Travis County, Texas

utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.
3.2.3

Late Archaic (3000 to 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into
2 subperiods (Late Archaic I and II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at site 41WM815 and dated between
2800 to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock
middens on the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in
any other period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a
result of the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes
such as sotol and yucca—foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens)

in order to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely
resulted in the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of
buffalo. Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an
increase in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile-making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart points to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 400 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis and Collins 1994) as well as increased
participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that
heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished.
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache Indians were well established in Central Texas by
the 14th century, and Comanche and Kiowa tribes arrived in the area by the 18th century 1 . The
first European known to have crossed the region was Domingo Terán de los Ríos, who made an
inspection tour to East Texas in 1691. When the Spanish moved their missions out of East
Texas in 1730, they relocated the missions of San Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra Señora de
la Purísima Concepción de los Hasinai, and San José de los Nazonis to locations near Barton
Springs. In 1827, the Mexican government granted Stephen F. Austin his third colony, Little
Colony, which was located east of the Colorado River and north and west of the Old San
Antonio Road. Mina (later Bastrop) became the headquarters of the colony, and Travis County
developed as an offshoot of Mina. Settlers moving into the area in the early 1830s included
Josiah and Mathias Wilbarger, Reuben Hornsby, Jacob M. Harrell, and John F. Webber. The
onset of the Texas Revolution delayed further settlement activity, and the news of the fall of the
Alamo prompted those settlers already in residence to flee.
Settlement resumed after the revolution, but it proceeded slowly because of the constant
threat of raids by the Comanche Indians. During the 1830s, a chain of small forts extended
from Bastrop northwest along Wilbarger’s Bend, Coleman Branch, Webber’s Prairie, and
Gilleland Creek, to Fort Colorado or Fort Prairie, 8 km (5 miles) east of the site of present-day
Austin. In June 1835, Thomas Jefferson Chambers surveyed part of an 8-league grant covering
the present-day site of Austin and the capitol. Sometime before 1837, William Barton settled
near the springs that were to bear his name. In 1837 or 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar
was on a buffalo hunt in the area and commented on its possibilities as a permanent site for the
capital. In 1838, the community of Waterloo (later Austin) consisted of 4 families, and about
20 families established homes at nearby Montopolis in 1839. When the Congress of the
Republic of Texas chose Waterloo as the site of the new capital, opponents were quick to point
out the disadvantages—the site's proximity to the frontier, the lack of timber, the poor soil, and
the threat of Indian raids. In spite of this opposition, however, the new capital—renamed Austin

in honor of Stephen F. Austin—was approved on 19 January 1840. A few days later, the
Congress established Travis County, naming it in honor of William Barret Travis and making
Austin its county seat. An election for county officials was held in February 1840, at which time
the population was reported to be 856. The initial boundaries of Travis County included roughly
40,000 square miles. Counties that were later carved from Travis County include Callahan
(1858), Coleman (1858), Comal (1846), Gillespie (1848), Hays (1848), Burnet (1852), Brown
(1856), Lampasas (1856), Eastland (1858), Runnels (1858), and Taylor (1858). Sam Houston
moved the government of the Republic of Texas from Austin to Houston when Mexican troops
invaded San Antonio in March 1842. When he tried to have the government archives removed
as well, Austin citizens resisted with the Archives War. The Texas Congress held sessions at
Washington-on-the-Brazos from 1842 to 1845, but the convention that drafted the Constitution
of 1845 met in Austin in July 1845, and by October the rest of the government had returned to
the capital city. The first legislature of the new state convened in Austin in February 1846.
The late 1840s and early 1850s were building years for Austin and Travis County, with
much of the growth fed by the presence of the state government—the Governor's Mansion,
office buildings, hotels, new homes, and newspapers. In 1850, Travis County had a population
of 3,138, of whom 2,336 were white, 791 were slaves, and 11 were free blacks; by 1860, the
number of residents had more than doubled to 8,080, with 4,931 of them white, 3,136 slaves,
and 13 free blacks. Although the city of Austin grew faster than the county as a whole—its
population rose from 629 in 1850 to 3,494 in 1860—most county residents lived in small
communities. Pflugerville and Del Valle were the most prominent of these communities, but
rural post offices were also established at Bluff Springs, Webberville, Merrilltown, Gilleland,
Cage’s Mill, and Hornsby Bend. During the 1850s, the amount of land in farms in what was
then Travis County increased from 73,300 acres to 1,363,500 acres. Corn was the primary field
crop, while cattle and sheep were the principal livestock. In 1860, farmers produced
137,700 bushels of corn and 27,900 bushels of wheat and had 58,000 cattle and 11,800 sheep.
The earliest schools in Travis County were private institutions that usually met in private
homes or in space donated by a church or Masonic lodge. More elaborate private facilities
began to appear by the late 1840s, including Colorado Female College in 1848, Austin Male
and Female Academy in 1849, Austin Female Academy in 1850, and Austin Collegiate Female
Institute in 1852. By 1850, Travis County also had 6 public schools serving a scholastic
population of 183. The county was divided into 19 common school districts in 1852. The state
established the Asylum for the Blind in Austin in 1856 and the Deaf and Dumb School in 1857.
Travis County became a center for higher education in the 1880s with the establishment of the
University of Texas in 1881, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute in 1881, and Saint
Edward's University in 1885. Samuel Huston College began holding classes in the 1890s. The
Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary opened in 1902, Texas Wesleyan College Academy
in 1912, Concordia Lutheran College in 1926, and the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the
Southwest in 1952. Austin Community College began operations in 1972. The availability of
schools resulted in a high level of education for a large portion of the county’s population. In the
1940s, while more rural areas of the state reported that less than 10% of their population over
the age of 25 had high school diplomas, nearly 20% of Travis County residents had graduated.
By 1980, that number had jumped to 75%.

The earliest churches in Travis County were the Catholic missions relocated to the area
by the Spanish in 1730, but these were moved to San Antonio in 1731, and it was more than a
century before any organized religious practices were firmly established. In the 1830s, a variety
of religious groups began to appear—Methodist circuit riders held services along Gilleland
Creek in 1837 or 1838; Presbyterians organized a church in Austin in October 1839; Mormons
settled near Fort Coleman, Webberville, and Hornsby Bend in the late 1830s; and Catholic
priests, among them Jean Marie Odin, returned to the area in 1840. A Baptist church and a
Church of Christ were organized in Austin in 1847, a Lutheran church was established in New
Sweden and a Jewish synagogue in Austin began in 1876, and a Christian Science church
formed in Austin in 1889. In the early 1980s, Travis County’s 266 churches had an estimated
combined membership of 194,194; Catholic, Southern Baptist, and United Methodist were the
largest denominations.
In spite of the rapid growth that Travis County experienced during the 1850s, the area
was at that time still very much at the edge of the frontier. The absence of railroads meant that
goods had to be shipped by wagon to and from Houston and Port Lavaca, and poor roads
meant that goods sometimes could not be shipped at all. In 1852, the Austin Railroad
Association was established to encourage railroad construction to the area, and considerable
progress had been made by the late 1850s; however, the Civil War intervened, and work on
railroad acquisition was postponed. The Secession Convention convened in Austin on
28 January 1861. Although a group of Austin citizens staged a demonstration in favor of
secession, Unionist sentiment was high, and Travis County residents voted against secession,
704 to 450. Nevertheless, when the Civil War began, Travis County provided several hundred
volunteers, among them the Travis Rifles, the Tom Green Rifles, the Capitol Guard, and the
Austin City Light Infantry. In the 2 months between the end of the war and the arrival of federal
troops in the county, looting of farms and businesses was common. Although the inevitable
clashes between the Unionist forces and the former rebels resulted in the arrest of as many as
30 people per day, the presence of federal troops served to curb much of the lawlessness. By
early 1866, most of the federal soldiers had been mustered out of service, leaving only about
200 men to police the Austin area until the end of the military occupation in 1870. Austin was
the site of the constitutional conventions of 1866 and 1868-69 and witnessed both the removal
of Governor James W. Throckmorton in 1867 and the Coke-Davis Controversy in 1874. In the
gubernatorial election of 1869, Travis County residents favored Andrew J. Hamilton to Edmund
J. Davis by a margin of 798 to 593.
Like most areas in the south, Travis County suffered considerable economic hardship
immediately after the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1864 and
1866, the county as a whole experienced a 49% loss in property tax receipts. Roughly 2/3 of
this property loss was in slaves, with the rest coming from declines in farm and livestock values,
each of which fell 25 to 40%. The county began to show signs of recovery by 1880. The overall
population rose from 13,153 in 1870 to 27,028 in 1880, and the 1880 census reported
1,912 farms, an increase of 656 over the 1870 totals. The amount of improved land rose from
83,200 acres in 1870 to 139,800 in 1880. Field crops such as corn, cotton, wheat, and oats
took up nearly half of the improved farmland, while livestock dominated the rest.

HJN 100144 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Economic recovery was facilitated by the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway, which completed its track to Austin in 1871, and the International and Great Northern
Railroad, which was built between Rockdale and Austin in 1876 and completed from Austin to
Laredo in 1881. The Austin and Northwestern Railroad laid track between Austin and Burnet in
1882, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line arrived in 1904. Communities besides Austin
that benefited directly from easy railroad access included Pflugerville, Manor, Oak Hill, and
Manchaca. After the war, many former slaves remained in the area. In the year after the war,
the black population increased by 60%, while the white population rose by only 12%. By 1870,
black residents numbered 4,647, comprising 35% of the county's total population. Clarksville,
Kincheonville, Masontown, and Wheatville were among the communities established by former
slaves. The number of black residents in Travis County continued to increase steadily, reaching
13,299 in 1900. It fluctuated between 13,000 and 15,000 from 1900 to 1930, but increased
rapidly thereafter, rising to 22,493 in 1950, 32,270 in 1970, and 63,173 in 1990. Because other
segments of the population grew at an even faster rate, the percentage of black residents, with
respect to the total population, declined significantly, falling to 20% by 1930 and 11% by 1990.
Contributing to the shift in the ethnic makeup of the county was a variety of immigrant groups,
the most prominent of which were German, Swedish, and Mexican. By the turn of the century,
8% of the population was composed of natives of 1 of these countries. Although the early
Swedish and German settlers contributed to the diversity of Travis County through their religious
and educational institutions, the Mexican influence was also reinforced by the continued arrival
of large numbers of new immigrants fleeing the unrest of the Mexican Revolution in the early
20th century. The 1930 census reported that 10,225 residents, or 13% of the county’s total
population, were of Hispanic descent; by 1990, the number of Hispanic residents had risen to
121,689, or 21%.
In 1890, Travis County had 36,322 residents. Of these, 14,575 lived in Austin, which
was fast outgrowing its efforts to become a modern city. Innovations and improvements in
progress at that time included a trolley system and water-generated electricity, but most of its
streets remained unpaved. By the turn of the century several hundred assorted businesses
filled the needs of the 22,000 Austin residents. Yet, in spite of this rapid increase in Austin’s
population, the majority of the county’s residents lived on farms or in smaller towns, and
agriculture dominated the area economy. Cotton became the principal field crop in the late
1880s and remained so for more than 60 years. The 1890 census reported 65,000 acres—
nearly 30% of the county's improved farmland—planted in cotton; by the turn of the century, the
amount of land devoted to cotton had increased to 113,300 acres, or 56% of the improved
farmland. However, as more marginal land was used and the soil became depleted, production
levels fell; in 1930, 143,000 acres produced only 19,000 bales. By the late 1950s, cotton
accounted for only 26% of the total cropland harvested, and by 1980 it had fallen to only 8%.
Farm tenancy had increased steadily since the 1890s and peaked in 1930, with tenants
operating 2/3 of the 3,642 farms. The number of farms fell by more than 1,000 in the 1930s, as
many tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other occupations. Farmers who remained
in the area began to devote more of their resources to crops other than cotton and to livestock.
The number of cattle increased from 32,000 in 1920 and to 51,000 in 1950; the number of
sheep and goats increased as well, boosting wool and mohair production from 23,600 and

22

4,292 pounds, respectively, in 1920, and to 127,800 and 183,600 pounds in 1959. By the late
1960s, hay and sorghum combined to account for 60% of the cropland harvested.
The Great Depression was slow to hit Travis County, but, by the mid-1930s, many
people were unemployed and very glad of the New Deal programs that resulted in work paving
streets; building bridges, sewers, and parks; and constructing the tower of the University of
Texas campus. In part because of the job opportunities made available through relief projects,
state government, and the university community, the population increased by 43% in the 1930s,
rising from 77,777 in 1930 to 111,053 in 1940. One major job-producing project in the 1930s
was the construction of a series of dams on the Colorado River. Austin and Travis County had
begun efforts to tame the Colorado as early as 1869, when the army built a pontoon bridge
across the river. In 1893, the City of Austin completed a dam designed to provide power for its
water and electrical systems. By 1899, the city was already experiencing power shortfalls, and
a major flood in 1900 destroyed the dam. Another flood in 1915 washed out the repairs that
were underway, and the project was abandoned. The flood of 1935 put much of downtown
Austin under water, and the area’s interest in a lasting flood-control system was renewed. The
Lower Colorado River Authority was established and a series of dams was built, forming Lake
Austin, Lake Travis, Lake Buchanan, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, Inks Lake, and Lake Marble
Falls. Travis County also profited from the establishment of several military bases. Camp
Mabry in northwest Austin, established as the main Texas National Guard facility in 1890,
served as an army training center during World War I. After the US became involved in World
War II, the Del Valle Army Air Base, soon renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field, was established
in southeast Travis County. After the war was over, the presence of military personnel
continued to bring changes to the county. Thousands of returning veterans enrolled in the local
colleges and universities, greatly increasing the student population as well as intensifying the
demand for housing and the growth of service industries.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Travis County underwent 2 significant developments. The first
of these was desegregation. The Sweatt v. Painter decision in 1950 pushed the University of
Texas to the forefront in the fight for civil rights, leading it to become the first southern university
to admit blacks as undergraduates, although it was not until 1962 that all of the university’s
facilities were fully integrated. Public schools in Travis County began to follow suit in 1955.
Local Mexican-American organizations also achieved a measure of success against
discriminatory practices. Some local businesses resisted these changes, prompting strikes and
protests in the 1960s, but in the end desegregation was accomplished without the violence
prevalent in other urban areas of the country. The change became even more visible as blacks
and Hispanics were elected to public office—Wilhelmina Delco to the school board in 1968 and
to the Texas House of Representatives in 1976; Berl Handcox to the Austin city council in 1971;
Richard Moya to the Travis County commissioner’s court in 1970; and Gonzalo Barrientos to the
Texas House of Representatives in 1974.
The second major development was the
establishment of several high-tech industries. In 1951, a small, local company became Texas
Instruments, and in 1955 Tracor, Incorporated, made Austin its base of operations.
International Business Machines opened an Austin branch in 1967, followed by Motorola in
1974. These companies, along with Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation
(1983), Dell Computers (1984), and Sematech (1988), became the county’s largest employers.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

From the end of Reconstruction to the present, most Travis County residents chose to
support Democratic presidential candidates, with exceptions in 1896, 1928, 1952, 1956, 1972,
and 1984. Occasionally, a third-party candidate drew a sizable portion of the vote, but only 3 of
them—the Greenback-Labor candidate in 1880, George Wallace in 1968, and John Anderson in
1984—garnered sufficient support to affect the county’s overall election results. In state
elections, Travis County residents were staunchly Democratic. In the early 1980s, 63% of the
land in Travis County was devoted to farms and ranches. About 23% of the farmland was under
cultivation, with sorghum, hay, wheat, and cotton accounting for nearly 70% of the 94,000 acres
harvested; other crops included potatoes, sweet potatoes, peaches, and pecans. Sixty-six
percent of the county’s $32 million in agricultural receipts came from livestock and livestock
products, the most important ones being cattle, milk, sheep, wool, and hogs. Although
agriculture remained an important aspect of the local economy, farm receipts were greatly
surpassed by the income generated by non-agricultural industries. Professional and related
services, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and government administration involved
70% of the work force in the 1980s; of the rest, 7% were self-employed and 3% employed
outside the county. Since shortly after the turn of the century, the majority of Travis County
residents had resided in the City of Austin. The jobs made available by the growth of the hightech industries reinforced that trend, and, by 1970, 85% of the 295,516 residents lived in the
capital city. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, residential development near Lake Travis
encouraged many people to move away from the city, and although Austin continued to grow at
a rapid pace, the number of residents choosing to live near the lake and in northern and
southern suburbs increased at an even faster rate. By 1990, Lago Vista (2,199), Jonestown
(1,250), Briarcliff (335), Lakeway (4,044), and Pflugerville (4,444) in Travis County, as well as
Round Rock and even Georgetown in Williamson County, had become popular alternatives to
living in Austin. Like the rest of Texas, Travis County weathered a serious economic downturn
in the mid-1980s; newly-built office space sat empty, and many people lost their jobs. Added to
this was news that Bergstrom Air Force Base was scheduled to close. In the early 1990s,
however, plans were underway to convert the Bergstrom site into a new municipal airport, and
the county was looking forward to a period of growth. The population of Travis County was
reported at 576,407 in 1990, an increase of 37% from 1980. Among the area’s most prevalent
concerns was that future growth should not destroy the ecological balance of environmentally
sensitive areas in the western hills.

cemetery and multiple-component aboriginal sites occur within 1.6 km (1.0 mile) of the proposed
Project Area. However, future development of the Project Area has the potential to impact 1
site, 41TV1709, which is a cemetery located north of the Project Area’s northern boundary.
Additionally, portions of the western Project Area fall within the 100-year floodplain, which would
appear to possess at least moderate potential to contain subsurface cultural resources.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the Project Area on
16 November 2010. This entailed an intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing
efforts. The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres on projects between 11
and 100 acres in size. As such, the 15.0 acres that comprise the Project Area required a total of
8 shovel tests to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by conducting 12
shovel tests within the Project Area.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs, along with their accompanying photo log, were also
completed. Locations representing shovel tests have been overlaid onto topographic maps of
the Project Area with the help of handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) units, which were
used in the field. These GPS handheld units utilize the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). These shovel test
locations are presented in Figure 15, and shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The intensive survey of the 15.0-acre Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1
previously unrecorded historic farmstead (41TV2389) consisting of 2 concrete stave silos, 1
water trough, 1 collapsed barn-like structure, and 1 gravel pit. In addition, the intensive cultural
resources survey examined 1 historic-age cemetery (site 41TV2389) located along the northern
boundary of the Project Area and the 100-year floodplain along the Project Area’s western
boundary. These findings are discussed in detail below.
6.1.1

Site 41TV2389

Site 41TV2389 was documented as a historic farmstead located just west of East Braker
Lane in the northeastern corner of the Project Area (Figure 16). The site consists of a collection
of features and constructions that are usually associated with farmsteads, but the site and its
surroundings lack evidence of any central house structure, either extant or razed. These
features and constructions collectively form site 41TV2389, which consists of 2 concrete stave
silos, 1 water trough, 1 collapsed barn-like structure, and 1 gravel pit (Figure 17). A 2-track road
accesses the site from the northeast corner, runs south, and then forks toward the silos and the
water trough.
Site 41TV2389 measures approximately 160.0 m (525.0 ft) north-south by 240.0 m
(787.4 ft) east-west. In the southernmost sector of the site are 2 standing concrete stave silos
that measure 10.0 m (32.8 ft) across and 15.0 m (49.2 ft) apart. The silos are constructed of a
series of concrete tiles wrapped in thick supporting metal rebar (Figure 18 and 19).
Approximately 50.0 m (164.0 ft) west of the silos is a north-south-oriented water trough made of
concrete that measures 1.0 m by 20.0 m (3.3 ft by 65.6 ft) in length (Figure 20). The trough is
situated on a concrete foundation that extends away from the trough approximately 1.0 m (3.3
ft) on either side. 2.0 m (6.6 ft) east of the trough is another concrete foundation that measures
roughly 2.0 m by 3.0 m (6.6 ft by 8.8 ft) in size (Figure 21). Approximately 50.0 m (164.0 ft)
north of the water trough is a tin-roofed and wood-framed structure that may have served as a
barn (Figures 22 and 23). The structure has since collapsed, but portions of the west and north
walls still stand. An east-west-oriented gravel pit that measures approximately 3.5 m (11.5 ft)
deep and 10.0 m (32.8 ft) wide is located 20.0 m (65.6 ft) north of the collapsed barn-like
structure (Figures 24 and 25). The pit contains an assortment of trash, corrugated metal, and

wood construction debris (Figure 26; see also Figures 24 and 25) and extends approximately
150.0 m (492.1 ft) along the northwest boundary of the Project Area. At the time of the survey,
small pieces of shattered cement were scattered in and around the concrete structures, but no
diagnostic specimens were present.
6.1.2

Site 41TV1709

Site 41TV1709 is a previously recorded historic cemetery located north of the northern
boundary of the Project Area (Figure 27; see also Figure 17 for location). At the time of the
survey, inspection of the site was hampered by a modern chain-linked fence surrounding the
site. Notwithstanding, site 41TV1709 seems to be a localized cemetery delineated by an ornate
wrought iron fence. In turn, site 41TV1709 is completely surrounded by the modern chainlinked fence (Figure 28). The modern fence serves as an approximately 15.0-m (49.2-ft) buffer
on all sides around site 41TV1709, and access into the buffered area is through a gate located
in a southeast segment of the modern fence. At the time of the survey, neither visible
depressions nor headstones were witnessed in the ground within or outside of the buffer area

41TV1709 is located beyond the northern boundary of the current Project Area.
6.1.3

City of Austin 100-Year Floodplain

A strip of land along the Project Area’s entire western boundary has been designated a
100-year floodplain (see Figures 9). A marked change in vegetation occurs within this
floodplain, where trees transition from predominantly chinaberry (genus Meliaceae) and
hackberry (genus Celtis) to live oak (genus Quercus) and cedar (genus Pinaceae). The
physiography and ground conditions also change, from relatively a flat topography and silty
clays in the eastern portion of the Project Area to exposed bedrock, shallow gravely loam, and
deeply carved drainage channels in the western portion of the Project Area (see Figures 7 and
8).

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the observed materials and structures associated with site 41TV2389, the
property seems to represent the remnants of a small farmstead occupied during the 20th
century. And although diagnostic specimens, inscribed dates, or remnant foundations were not
encountered in or around any of the features and constructions, review of historical aerial
photographs reveals that by 1940 the property contained a number of buildings (PCL 1954),
which may or may not include the remnant structures observed during the cultural resources
survey. The 2 concrete stave silos associated with site 41TV2389 appear to indicate that the

property contained livestock because these types of concrete silos were commonly used to hold
silage to feed cows (PSI 2010). Furthermore, the long water trough associated with the site
also suggests that a large number of animals were kept on the property. This may indicate that
the farmstead functioned as a dairy. However, it is likely that the farmstead was settled
sometime during the 1930s. A title commitment issued on 24 August 2010 by Alliant National
Title Insurance Company (GF No. 00101842) states that an electric transmission and/or
distribution line easement was granted by the Texas Power & Light Company on 17 August
1936 (recorded in Volume 551, pgs. 460 and 480 of the Deed Records of Travis County,
Texas). Based on these points, along with the site’s lack of potential for harboring buried
cultural deposits due to the presence of shallow clay soils and exposed limestone bedrock, it is
Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2389 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and that no
additional investigations are warranted on this site.
Site 41TV1709 is a previously recorded historic cemetery located north of the northern
boundary of the current Project Area. It is surrounded by and contained within a modern chainlinked fence. Intensive surface inspection and 2 shovel tests excavated within the Project Area
that borders the modern chain-linked fence surrounding the cemetery found no evidence of
burials associated with site 41TV1709. Based on the intensive survey and the fact that no
development is proposed for areas within 22.9 m (75.0 ft) of the marked southern boundary of
the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV1709 will not be adversely affected by development
of the Project Area.
Four shovel tests were excavated in the Project area that overlaps the 100-year
floodplain. These tests revealed only shallow gravely loam. Every one of the 4 excavated
shovel tests reached bedrock within 45.0 centimeters (cm) (17.7 inches [in]) of the surface. No
evidence of deep alluvial soils or cultural deposits was found within this zone of the Project
Area. Based on these data, it is Horizon’s opinion that the observed shallow soils and
associated physiography within the 100-year floodplain do not warrant further investigation,
either through intensive surface inspection, shovel testing, or mechanized trenching.
Based on the results of the intensive cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the currently proposed design for the development of the Manor ISD tract would pose no
adverse impacts to significant cultural resources. Therefore, Horizon recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the undertaking. In the unlikely event that future
development plans are found to impact areas within 22.9 m (75.0 ft) of the marked southern
boundary of site 41TV1709 (the historic cemetery), then Horizon recommends mechanical
scraping of those affected areas to determine if any unmarked graves are located outside the
visible boundaries of the cemetery and within the Project Area. Furthermore, if any cultural
materials are inadvertently discovered at any point during the development of the Project Area
(even in previously surveyed areas), all work at the location of the find should cease
immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.
