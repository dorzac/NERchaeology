Abstract

ABSTRACT
Under TAC Permit #4747, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an
intensive areal archeological survey of approximately 117 acres of the proposed
State Highway (SH) 130 Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area along Plum Creek
in northern Caldwell County, Texas. The survey area was limited to all portions
of the proposed wetland mitigation area north of Plum Creek; the survey of areas
south of the creek was completed under TAC Permit #4584. The proposed Plum
Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area is located on private land that will be
acquired by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Archeologists
excavated a total of 27 shovel tests (in wetland areas with depths of impact less
than two feet/61 cm) and four backhoe trenches (in deep water areas whose
maximum depth of impact was five feet/152 cm), all of which were negative for
archeological deposits. The project area overall bore evidence of repeated
disturbance from grading and agricultural activities and was generally very low
in potential for containing intact cultural resources within the project’s depth of
impact.
Surveyors did locate the historic remains of State Highway 29,
abandoned in 1951, in the eastern extremes of the study area. This roadway
was determined NRHP ineligible and will nonetheless be largely unaffected by
the proposed undertaking. Archeologists followed a no collection policy during
the survey, and since this survey did not result in the documentation of any
archeological sites, all project related documents and photographs will be
maintained by Hicks & Company. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator
that construction on portions of the Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation
Area located north of the creek should be allowed to proceed with no further
work required and no historic properties affected.

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
On July 17, 2002 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) issued an
individual permit (#199600228) to the Austin District of the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) authorizing the discharge of dredged and fill material
into waters of the United States as part of the State Highway (SH) 130
construction. The 404 permit required the mitigation of unavoidable adverse
impacts to waters of the U.S. in accordance with the Conceptual Mitigation Plan,
Proposed State Highway 130, Texas Turnpike Authority, USACE-Fort Worth
District Project #199600228. The conceptual mitigation plan will result in the
enhancement and creation of approximately 63 acres of waters of the U.S. on
approximately 175 acres of streamside/floodplain habitat. These 175 acres
would be developed within a 265 acre tract called the Plum Creek Stream and
Wetland Mitigation Area along Plum Creek in Caldwell County, Texas. The
project is funded by the Austin District of the Texas Department of
Transportation.
The Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area is subject to Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Texas
Antiquities Code as the project area will be owned and controlled by TxDOT and
Caldwell County. The proposed Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation
Area is located along Plum Creek, just west of US 183 and the proposed SH 130
right-of-way. The project area will encompass 265 acres, however only 175
acres of this property will be utilized for wetlands mitigation. Of these 175
acres, approximately 153 acres will be directly impacted to a depth of between
two feet and five feet below ground surface. The 265 acres represent the total
Area of Potential Effect (APE) and will consist of unaffected areas, riparian
woodlands, wetlands, deepwater areas, and streambeds (Figure 1). The 153
acres represent the limits of actual construction to a depth of up to five feet
(1.52 m). One previously recorded archeological site (Site 41CW111) is located
within the proposed project area on the south side of Plum Creek.
Under the Exclusive Development Agreement between TxDOT and Lone Star
Infrastructure (LSI), LSI is responsible for providing a mitigation plan and
acquiring and developing the land within the mitigation area. Hicks & Company
was contracted by LSI to perform the cultural resources investigations prior to
development of the property.
These investigations were conducted in
accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended,
and 36 CFR 800, the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for
Archaeology and Historic Preservation (48 FR 44716-44742), and the Secretary’s
Standards for Identification (48 FR 44720-44723), the Texas Antiquities Code (13
TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and 13 TAC 26.20(2)), and the
Protocol for Historic Property Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment for the
SH 130 Project, the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the
THC, the FHWA, TxDOT, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
After receipt of a Texas Antiquities Permit (TAC #4584), Hicks & Company
conducted intensive survey investigations within the project area south of Plum
Creek (99 acres plus a 48-acre buffer). At the time of that survey there was no
right-of-entry for the portions of the mitigation area on the north side of Plum
Creek. Survey there resulted in recording one minor, disturbed surficial
prehistoric site (41CW111) and two isolated flake finds. The surveyed southern
portion was recommended for construction to proceed with no further work and
no historic properties affected.

Introduction and Management Summary

This report presents the results of investigations for the areas on the north side
of Plum Creek only.
The field investigations consisted of an intensive survey of the affected areas
including visual inspection of the ground surface and subsurface testing in the
form of shovel tests and backhoe trenches. The entirety of the survey area is
currently under private ownership with TxDOT taking possession of the property
at a future date. A total of 27 shovel tests and four backhoe trenches were
excavated within the proposed project area (Figure 2). All of these tests were
negative for cultural material. No archeological sites or features or any other
indications of significant cultural resources were identified within the proposed
project area. Remnants of the abandoned State Highway 29 were recorded but
were determined to be NRHP ineligible. Construction for the undertaking has
been recommended to proceed with no historic properties affected on the north
side of Plum Creek.
The field investigations were conducted between December 20th and 28th, 2007.
Mason Miller served as the Principal Investigator for the project and supervised
the field investigations and report production. John A. Campbell served as
Project Archeologist responsible for background research, field supervision, and
report contributions. The field crew consisted of Matt Stotts and Bradford Jones
and Anne-Marie Griger. The results of the intensive survey are presented in the
subsequent chapters. No artifacts were collected during the course of the
investigations. Since the survey was negative for artifacts or archeological sites,
all project-related materials will be maintained by Hicks & Company and not
submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

DEFINITION OF PROPOSED ACTION AND IMPACTS
Riparian Woodlands
There will be two different zones of riparian woodlands; both of these are nonwetland zones (Table 1). The first zone will be riparian woodlands to preserve in
place. These areas contain existing riparian woodland environments along the
stream margins; there will be no direct impacts in these zones and survey was
limited to brief surface inspection. These zones total 13.6 acres of the total
mitigation area north of Plum Creek. The second zone will be planted riparian
woodlands. These areas total 34 acres and direct impacts in these areas will be
limited to the surface and immediately below. Impacts consist of manually or
machine planting seedlings. Shovel tests were excavated at a rate of one test per
two acres to a maximum depth of 50 centimeters.
Wetlands
These areas will be new wetlands and are divided into emergent wetlands and
forest/scrub wetlands. Both of these areas will be excavated to depths of 18 to
24 inches below ground surface to create persistent wetland hydrology. These
areas will also be planted with emergent species and wetland-adapted woody
trees. Combined, these two areas total 15.2 acres north of Plum Creek. Shovel
tests were excavated at a rate of one test per two acres to a maximum depth of
70 centimeters.

Introduction and Management Summary

Deepwater Areas
There are four deepwater areas within the Plum Creek Stream and Wetland
Mitigation Area north of the creek totaling eight acres. These areas will be
excavated to a depth of two to five feet below ground surface. Due to the deep
impacts and the potential for buried archeological sites, these areas required
backhoe trenches. Machine excavations would target areas of high archeological
site probability while minimizing physical disturbance to the surrounding
environment. Trenches were excavated at a rate of one trench per deepwater
area (four total).
Streambeds
Streambeds within the mitigation area north of the creek total 1.5 acres. There
are no proposed impacts to these areas. No archeological investigations were
conducted within these locations.
Buffer Zone
Forty-four acres of additional land north of Plum Creek are slated to be included
with the wetland mitigation area, however, this land is not slated for any
impacts at all and is merely a buffer zone between private land and the actual
wetland area. This area was briefly surface inspected.

SURVEY METHODS
The proposed survey adhered to the THC/CTA survey standards for intensive
areal investigations and utilized a pedestrian survey augmented with backhoe
trenching and shovel testing to investigate the APE. All excavated sediment
from shovel tests was screened through ¼ inch mesh hardware cloth and shovel
tests were backfilled once excavations were complete.
Shovel tests were
excavated in ten centimeter levels, profiled, and recorded on standardized shovel
test forms. In deep water areas, where impacts are expected to extend below
one meter, the investigators used a backhoe to explore the potential for deeply
buried deposits. Based on the level of impact, trenches were excavated to a
maximum of five feet in depth.
Selected samples of excavated material
(approximately 30%) from backhoe trenches were screened through ¼-inch
mesh hardware cloth.
Trenches were meticulously scraped, profiled,
photographed, and recorded on standardized backhoe trench forms.

Environmental Setting and Geology

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING AND GEOLOGY
The proposed Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area is located in
Caldwell County, Texas within the Blackland Prairie physiographic province.
The regional ecology is a grassland characterized by gentle topography and in its
natural state is predominantly covered with native grasses including little
bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Indian
grass (Sorghastrum nutans), and tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper) in the uplands
and eastern grama grass (Tripsacum dactyloides) and switch grass (Panicum
virgatum) in the lowlands (Gould 1975). The generally southeasterly trending
rivers and streams are also home to elm, cottonwood, pecan, oak, and
sugarberry trees. Today much of the region is agricultural land, with an
emphasis on cotton, corn, milo and wheat, a use that it has been prized for
since significant European settlement began in the region. Blair (1950:101-102)
notes an array of mammal species including deer, rabbit, coyote, bobcat, as well
as many reptiles, amphibians, and snails are typical of this region.
Vegetation in the specific project area consists of species typical of mesquite
savannah and pasture with a strip of riparian woodland adjacent to Plum Creek.
The western portion of the project area has very dense vegetation consisting of
mesquite stands and dense ragweed (Figure 3). The eastern half of the project
area is currently open pasture used for livestock agriculture and dominated
primarily by broomweed and tall grasses (Figure 4). Overall the project area has
been overgrazed and is severely deflated.
The project area is situated within late Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits and
recent alluvium. To the south of the project area the underlying bedrock
consists of the Eocene Wills Point formation sands and clays and to the north
are the Upper Cretaceous Navarro Group and Marlbrook Marl clays (BEG 1974).
Soils in the project area are predominantly the alluvial Trinity soils and clays
(Lowther and Werchan 1978). Both Trinity clay (Tr) and Trinity soils, frequently
flooded (Ts) are found within the project area. These soils consist of deep, nearly
level, calcareous clay characterized by a surface layer of dark-gray calcareous
clay overlying gray calcareous clay with slickensides and some calcium
carbonate concretions. The uplands surrounding the project area consist of
Heiden, Branyon, and Houston Black clays. Three different Heiden series soils
are present in the project area, south of Plum Creek: Heiden-Ferris complex
(HhF3), Heiden Clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded (HeC2), and Heiden Clay, 5 to
8 percent slopes (HeD2). These soils all tend to consist of a surface layer of darkgrayish brown calcareous clay overlying light olive-brown mottled clay. Branyon
clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (BrB) is present in the project area. These soils are
typically characterized by 20 inches (50.8 cm) of dark-gray, calcareous clay on
the surface underlain by 17 inches (43 cm) of gray calcareous clay with a few
calcium carbonate concretions. These overlay about 16 inches (40.6 cm) of lightgray calcareous clay resting on light yellowish-brown silty clay mixed with
calcium carbonate and limestone gravels.

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The prehistoric cultures of central Texas are defined as nomadic huntergatherers from the Paleoindian until well into the historic period. Most of the
chronologies for central Texas are based on four distinct periods, representing a
12,000-year sequence of occupation. This sequence from Collins (2004) is as
follows: Paleoindian (ca. 11,500-8,800 B.P.), Archaic (8,800-1,200 B.P.), Late
Prehistoric (1,200-400 B.P.), and Historic (400 B.P.-present). Although these
divisions represent arbitrary temporal categories, they are also based in large
part on perceived adaptations in subsistence, and are reflected in changes in
lithic and other technologies. Central Texas is one of the better-known regions
of the state archeologically.
More sites have been recorded, tested and
excavated in this area than in any other part of the state (Black 1989).
The Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area falls within the Blackland
Prairie archeological region, which is somewhat underrepresented in terms of
prehistoric site density. Intact prehistoric sites tend to be clustered along first
order streams, with only occasional minor sites in between. It has been
suggested that prehistoric utilization of this region was intermittent, or confined
mainly to the riparian arteries along major waterways (Brownlow 2003).
Researchers have tended to link the low archeological site density within the
Blackland Prairie to limited water supply and the lack of large mammals such as
bison and pronghorn antelope (Shafer and Bryant 1976), forcing the nomadic
hunter-gatherers who moved through this region on their seasonal migrations to
adhere to the waterways. However, cultural and territorial forces must also be
acknowledged. The fact is, the Blackland Prairie is located at the intersection of
several archeologically distinctive culture areas—the hunter-gatherer burned
rock cultures of the north and west, the coastal groups to the east, and the
Caddoan tribes of the Post Oak Savannah/Eastern Woodlands. One final
explanation for the low occurrence of prehistoric sites on the Blackland Prairie is
that many prehistoric archeological sites were no doubt destroyed by farming
and intensive agricultural use of the Blackland Prairie during the latter half of
the nineteenth century.
Based on what is known about the prehistoric environment it seems probable
that prehistoric occupation of the Blackland Prairie would have required the
utilization of both plateau and prairie resources with considerable seasonal
mobility between the two (Potter 2006; Ricklis and Collins 1994). While lithic
reduction areas are not uncommon and burned rock middens are not completely
absent from the region, most of the occupation sites in the Blackland Prairie
represent short-term campsites in open, unprotected areas situated on alluvial
terraces adjacent to streams or rivers (Black 1989). Many central Texas
archeological sites located along the larger waterways, such as the Colorado
River, the San Gabriel River, and Brushy Creek, have also been deeply buried by
Holocene alluvium (Johnson 2000). A typical open occupation site in central
Texas contains refuse such as chert flaking debris, broken chert tools,
fragmented burned rock, land snails, fragmented animal bone and charred plant
remains within the context of a cooking facility such as an oven or a stone
hearth. An additional characteristic of open sites is the presence of diagnostic
stone tools often representing occupations from different periods or phases and
ultimately suggesting repeated use over hundreds or perhaps thousands of
years.
Buried intact prehistoric occupation sites are typically considered
archeologically significant when identified.

Cultural Background

Though indigenous groups have a long history in the region, including the
presence of historically documented Tonkawa, Karankawa, and Comanche
groups, the area that would become known as Caldwell County was not settled
by Europeans until the early 19th century (Smyrl 2007). Originally part of Green
DeWitt’s 1825 grant from the Mexican government and later included as part of
Gonzales County in 1836, Caldwell County was formally organized in March of
1848. The county seat, Lockhart, was established at this time as well.
The earliest settlements, beginning in the 1820s and 1830s, were located along
the San Marcos River and Plum Creek. Population growth was fairly rapid
throughout much of the nineteenth century as new communities formed within
Caldwell County. The early economic focus of the residents of Caldwell County
was agricultural, especially livestock. Though negatively impacted by the Civil
War and Reconstruction, the local economy remained viable with its ongoing
focus on livestock, an industry which peaked in the 1880s and 1890s. After the
1890s the economy became increasingly dependent on cotton farming until
cotton harvests began to decline in the 1920s, resulting in the growth of more
diversified farming and ranching industry. The agriculture focus of the economy
also shifted in 1922 with the discovery of oil. Though the amount of oil produced
in the county has declined over time, oil production has served as an important
economic resource for the county (Smyrl 2007).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and the
Texas Historical Commission indicates that there are no previously recorded
archeological sites within the northern project APE. In addition, one previous
investigation conducted by the United States Soil Conservation Service in 1983
overlaps the northeastern-most portions of the current APE. No new sites were
recorded in the project area during the course of the survey. There are five
archeological sites within 1000 meters of the proposed project area: 41CW81,
41CW82, 41CW89, 41CW90 and 41CW111.
Site 41CW81 is a historic
farmstead and prehistoric lithic scatter with some historic structural elements
and shallow archeological deposits. Site 41CW82 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
identified within the top 30 centimeters of sediment and has no associated
features. Site 41CW89 is a prehistoric and historic artifact scatter that has an
associated historic age cistern; artifacts at this site were limited to the surface.
Finally, Site 41CW90 is a historic farm complex with three structures, a cistern,
and an associated artifact scatter found in the upper 10 centimeters of
sediment. All of these sites were recorded by PBS&J in 2001 and 2002 as part
of their intensive survey of the SH 130 right-of-way. All four of these sites were
determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP as a result of PBS&J’s
investigations. Finally, Site 41CW111 is a minor, highly disturbed surficial and
shallowly-buried prehistoric lithic scatter recorded during Hicks & Company’s
survey of the wetland mitigation area south of Plum Creek. The site lacked any
aspects that qualified it for inclusion in the NRHP or as a SAL.
Survey of the Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area south of the
creek was completed in November of 2007. Study in this portion of the project
area revealed extensive surficial and sub-surficial disturbance in the form of
continuous agricultural activity and landscape grading. Overall due to the
prevalence of disturbance, the project area south of Plum Creek was found to
have a low probability for intact cultural resources within the project’s APE. The
entire 148 acres of wetland mitigation area (including 99 acres of actually
impacted wetlands and 49 acres of buffer that is not slated for any construction

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Intensive areal archeological survey investigations were conducted between
December 20 and 28, 2007 in the portions of the Stream and Wetland Mitigation
Area on the north side of Plum Creek. During the course of survey, researchers
investigated 34 acres of proposed planted riparian woodlands, 15 acres forested
scrub and emergent wetlands, and four proposed deep water areas.
Archeologists visually inspected the full project area and excavated a total of 27
shovel tests in all non-deep water areas that were subject to ground-disturbing
activity and four backhoe trenches in deep water areas. All of the subsurface
investigations were negative for archeological deposits. The project area in
general was found to be severely deflated by repeated agricultural activities
(plowing, overgrazing, etc.) and lacked the potential for containing significant
intact cultural resources within the project’s prescribed depths of impact. No
cultural material was identified within the project area as a result of the survey.
Below is a brief description of the results of this survey and the findings made
therein beginning with intensive surface survey and shovel testing.

PROJECT AREA CONDITIONS
The Plum Creek Mitigation Area north of Plum Creek sits in a flat, broad
floodplain (Figure 3). The project area in the north is divided by a north-south
trending intermittent tributary of Plum Creek. The areas west of this drainage
are dominated by dense mesquite and ragweed, while the areas east of the
drainage are open pasture dominated primarily by broomweed and sparse
grasses. The areas along the drainage and also Plum Creek are dense riparian
zones. A smaller drainage trends from west to east through the middle of the
property (Figure 5). The entire project area is covered with dense vegetation
resulting in ground surface visibility between 0 and 15 percent. The lessor of
the property south of Plum Creek indicated that the creek generally had two
stages: dry and overflowing. He mentioned that at times the water would reach
the tops of some of the smaller trees close to the creek channel with large logs
left suspended in the branches following the water’s recession. Near the eastern
edge of the property are the remains of an abandoned roadway, (State Highway
29) which was active prior to construction of US 183 in 1951 (Figure 6, see
Roadway Discussion). Aside from the abandoned roadway and severe erosion,
there are few disturbances on the property.

SHOVEL TESTING
According to the TxDOT/THC-approved research design, the subsurface testing
strategy varied depending on the proposed depth of impact for a given wetland
resource area. In areas with shallow or surficial impacts (planted riparian
woodlands), testing terminated at a pre-determined depth of 50 centimeters.
Emergent wetland areas and forested scrub wetlands, whose depths of impact
ranged from one to two feet (30-61 cm), were tested to a depth of at least 70
centimeters. Areas not slated for ground-disturbing construction activities
(streambeds, preserved riparian woodlands) were surface inspected only. Of the
27 shovel tests excavated during the course of survey, none were positive for
cultural materials (Table 2).

Shovel tests across the study area were typically composed of dark gray to very
dark gray silty clay (2.5Y 4/1 to 3/1) to a depth of 70 centimeters below ground
surface. In general, the shovel testing throughout the Plum Creek Wetland
Mitigation site indicates that proposed construction in the area has a relatively
very low potential for impacting cultural resources. All of the tests were negative
for any artifacts or indications of historic cultural activity.

BACKHOE TRENCHING
Archeologists from Hicks & Company excavated a total of four backhoe trenches
within the four proposed deep water areas during their field investigations in the
northern portions of the Plum Creek Mitigation area (Figure 2). Construction at
each of these deep water areas will be limited to a minimum of two feet and a
maximum depth of five feet. As such, all trenching was limited to this maximum
depth of impact. As per the survey’s approved research design, each deep water
area was investigated with one deep backhoe trench, to confirm a presence or
absence of cultural materials. Each trench measured approximately 100
centimeters in width with a length of approximately 425 to 500 centimeters.
None of the trenches (Trenches 1N – 4N) contained cultural materials or any
other evidence of significant historic or prehistoric cultural activity.
Soils observed during trenching were generally composed of two or three
horizons of black, gray or dark brown clays and silty clays with occasional
trenches containing shell, gravels, introduced topsoil or sand. Trenches 1N, 2N,
and 3N were all excavated in the eastern portion of the project area in deep
water areas 1, 2, and 3. Trench 4N was excavated in the southwestern portion
of the project area in deep water area 4. Soils contained in Trench 1N (DP #1)
were composed of 41 centimeters of 2.5Y 4/1 (dark gray) silty clay topsoil (plow
zone) followed by 5Y 4/1 (dark gray) blocky and friable silty clay between 41 and
120 centimeters below surface. Slickensides were observed in the second zone.
The final zone was composed of 2.5Y 5/3 light olive brown silty clay with small
CaCO3 inclusions. This trench was negative for cultural material.

Trench 2N was excavated in DP #3 in the southeastern portion of the project
area. Soils observed in this trench consisted of a 2.5Y 4/1 (dark gray) silty clay
plow zone between 0 and 44 centimeters below ground surface. The second
zone was primarily a transition zone between the first and third soil zones and
contained an even mix of both soils ranging from 44 to 70 centimeters below
ground surface. The third and final zone ranging from 70 to 154 centimeters
below ground surface consisted of 2.5Y 5/2 silty clay with some sand and
cobbles and gravels over less than 2 percent of the zone. A low density of snail
shell fragments was also observed in the last zone. This trench was negative for
cultural material.
Trench 3N was excavated in DP #2 in the northeastern portion of the project
area. The plow zone observed in this trench was between 0 and 43 centimeters
below ground surface and consisted of 2.5Y 3/1 (very dark gray) silty clay.
Below this the second zone consisted of 2.5Y 4/1 (dark gray) blocky, silty clay
between 43 and 94 centimeters below ground surface. The third zone was a
more compact 2.5Y 4/1 (dark gray) silty clay between 94 and 158 centimeters
below ground surface. The bottom two zones of the trench are slightly
laminated. This trench was negative for cultural material.
Trench 4N was excavated in DP #4 in the southwestern portion of the project
area. This area has a much higher density of vegetation with dense stands of
mesquite and ragweed. The profile of this trench was typical of the other
trenches excavated in the project area (Figure 7). A plow zone was observed in
this trench between 0 and 44 centimeters below ground surface consisting of
2.5Y 4/1 (dark gray) silty clay. This zone was wetter than the upper zones of the
other trenches due to the proximity to Plum Creek. The second and final zone of
the trench consisted of 2.5Y 4/2 (dark grayish brown) silty clay between 44 and
158 centimeters below ground surface. Some sand and small CaCO3 inclusions
were also observed in this zone. This trench was negative for cultural material.

ROADWAY DISCUSSION
Surveyors noted a prominent stretch of abandoned roadway near the eastern
edge of the Plum Creek Wetland Mitigation Area (Figure 2). Background
archival research indicates that the stretch of roadway is likely the abandoned
State Highway 29, or Middle Buster Highway.
This single-lane highway
extended from Austin to Port O’Connor through smaller towns including
Lockhart, Luling, Gonzales and Victoria (among others). It is not known when
construction of the highway commenced or how much was constructed by 1918,
but in that year county commissioners applied for State and Federal aid for
repairs of nearly four miles of the highway between Austin and Lockhart,
making this repair project one of the first in the state to receive Federal aid
under the 1916 Federal Aid Road Act. The road was abandoned by 1951 with
the construction of US 183, and has been essentially untouched since then.
Following the roadway south (outside of the current study area), State Highway
29 crosses Plum Creek at a Warren Pony Truss bridge. This bridge was
surveyed for NRHP eligibility in 2001 and determined National Register eligible
(SH 130 Historic Resources Survey Report Site #139). The boundary of this
National Register property on the north side of Plum Creek is a gate that stands
well south of any ground-disturbing segments of the wetland mitigation area. To
avoid potential 4(f) concerns regarding the bridge, the boundary of the Plum
Creek Wetland Mitigation Area was shifted slightly to avoid acquisition of the

N.R. Property, placing it thus outside of the archeological APE. From an
archeological perspective, no portion of the bridge will be affected by the
proposed undertaking (USDOT et al. 2001, 2005).
Unlike the Plum Creek Bridge, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that
this portion of State Highway 29 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. While
its association with early Texas highway travel most closely can be associated
with Criterion A (“… associated with events that have made significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history.”), this association is overly
generous, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator. The road is not associated
with any significant events or people (Criterion B), is generally unremarkable
and not distinctive of type, quality, method or period (Criterion C), and will not
likely yield any new historical information (Criterion D). Lacking convincing
fulfillment of any of the NRHP criteria, the road within the study area is not
recommended as a historic property. This opinion is further reinforced by the
existing SH 130 Historic Structures Report’s determination that the roadway is
not eligible and not a contributing element of the National Register eligibility of
the Plum Creek Bridge (USDOT et al. 2001). Finally, current design plans for
the Wetland Mitigation Area place the overwhelming majority of the roadway
within the unaltered buffer zone between wetland areas. While a small portion
of PLRW#1C does cross the roadway, this is very small relative to the amount of
roadway that is present and undisturbed. As such, the proposed undertaking
will not affect any historic properties related to this abandoned roadway from an
archeological perspective.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Under TAC Permit 4747, archeologists surveyed the northern portions of the
proposed SH 130 wetland mitigation site in northern Caldwell County, Texas.
Through the course of three field days, archeologists investigated approximately
49 acres of proposed newly created wetlands along with four proposed deep
water areas (eight acres) through subsurface shovel testing and backhoe
trenching. The remaining 60 acres of the wetland mitigation area include a 44­
acre buffer, 1.5 acres of streambeds and 14 acres of preserved woodlands that
will not be impacted by the proposed undertaking. These areas were briefly
surface inspected.
Surveyors recorded the abandoned remnants of State
Highway 29 in the eastern portions of the study area. The survey was
conducted in partial fulfillment of the Section 106 requirements associated with
the project’s USACE Section 404 permitting process and the FHWA’s partial
project funding as well as TAC obligations related to the County’s ultimate
ownership of the wetland property following construction. All proposed shallow
to moderately impacted areas (depths of impact of less than two feet) were
intensively shovel tested at a rate that met or exceeded the THC’s minimum
standards for areal surveys, with a total of 27 tests excavated. All proposed
deep water areas (n=4), whose construction depths of impact are noted as no
greater than five feet, were intensively investigated through backhoe trenching
to that maximum construction depth. None of the subsurface tests were
positive for cultural materials.
Overall, the project area exhibits a very low potential for intact archeological
deposits to occur. The lack of cultural material on the ground surface and in
excavated tests coupled with severe erosion and agricultural activity on the
property supports this conclusion. State Highway 29 did not fulfill any of the
criteria necessary for NRHP eligibility. In addition, only a very small portion will
be affected by the undertaking as the majority of the nearby wetland area
boundaries are delineated by the roadway. The roadway connects to the Plum
Creek Bridge, a NRHP-eligible structure that spans the creek well south of any
ground disturbing wetland areas. Even though this structure is in the project
vicinity, it will archeologically be unaffected. The roadway has been determined
to not be a contributing element to its NRHP eligibility. It is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that the proposed Wetland Mitigation undertaking/action
north of Plum Creek (including impacted and unimpacted areas as defined
above) should be allowed to proceed to construction without further cultural
resource-related regulatory consideration or correspondence and with no
historic properties affected.
