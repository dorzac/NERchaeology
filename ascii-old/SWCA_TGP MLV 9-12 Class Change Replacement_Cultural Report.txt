Archaeological Survey of the Proposed TGP MLV 19-2 Pipeline Class Change Replacement Project

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Kinder Morgan, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an archaeological
survey of the proposed TGP MLV 19-2 Pipeline Class Change Replacement Project in Harris and Waller
Counties, Texas. The investigation included an archaeological background literature and records review,
and an intensive pedestrian survey augmented by shovel testing. Investigations were performed pursuant
to regulatory obligations related to the construction and/or modification of a natural gas pipeline under a
blanket certificate issued pursuant to Subpart F, Section 157 (201)(206) of the Natural Gas Act and in
accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). SWCA’s investigations included a
background literature and records review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing to
systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the significance of any cultural
resources located within the project area.
Portions of the current work were conducted under Kinder Morgan’s 2013 Blanket Clearance Agreement
for Minor Construction and Maintenance Activities. Per this agreement, cultural resources survey was
limited to areas where the affected lands fell outside of areas covered by the agreement. For ease of
discussion, the project area is split into two locations: a northern project area and a southern project area.
The northern project area totals 47.09 acres of land. Only 20.11 acres of land was intensively surveyed;
the remaining 26.98 acres of land falls within the existing corridor and work area under the 2013 Blanket
Clearance Agreement and does not require survey. The southern project area totals 7.66 acres of land.
Within the southern project area, 0.47 acres of land was subjected to cultural resources survey. The
remaining 7.19 acres of land falls within the existing corridor and work area under the 2013 Blanket
Clearance Agreement and does not require survey.
A background literature review shows that only two cultural resources surveys had been conducted within
1 mile of the project areas. Neither survey intersected with the project areas. Additionally, there are no
previously recorded archaeological sites, NRHP listed properties, or State Antiquities Landmarks present
within or adjacent to the project areas. The closest cultural resource is a cemetery that is located 1.18 mile
southwest of the northern project area.
A total of 26 shovel tests were attempted within the northern and southern project areas. None of these
were positive for cultural material and no evidence of cultural features was identified. Overall, both the
northern and southern project areas showed evidence of substantial ground disturbance. The excavated
shovel tests were highly variable and mottled and in some areas exposed subsoil was documented. Other
disturbances included a transmission corridor, pipeline corridor, paved roads, culverts and other facilities
observed within the project areas. There were also areas that were under standing water.
Based on the results of the current survey effort, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed project would
have NO EFFECT TO HISTORIC PROPETIES. As such, SWCA recommends no further archaeological
investigation of the currently defined project area and the project be allowed to proceed.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Kinder Morgan, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an archaeological
survey of the proposed TGP MLV 19-2 Pipeline Class Change Replacement Project (Figure 1).
Investigations were performed pursuant to regulatory obligations related to the construction and/or
modification of a natural gas pipeline under a blanket certificate issued pursuant to Subpart F, Section 157
(201)(206) of the Natural Gas Act and in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA). SWCA’s investigations included a background literature and records review and an intensive
pedestrian survey with shovel testing to systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if possible,
determine the significance of any cultural resources located within the project area.
Within the areas that were identified for cultural resources survey, all investigations were conducted in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) standards, with any exceptions thoroughly
documented. Meredith Moreno served as Principal Investigator for the project, and SWCA archaeologists
Kristen Jeremiah and C. Wesley Mattox conducted the fieldwork investigations on March 5, 2014.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Kinder Morgan TGP MLV 19-2 Pipeline Class Change Replacement project is located just outside of
Katy, Texas in Harris and Waller Counties. The proposed project work falls under Kinder Morgan’s 2013
Blanket Clearance Agreement for Minor Construction and Maintenance Activities. As such, the areas
where land disturbance will take place to the same extent and depth of the original work within the
previously disturbed and maintained Kinder Morgan rights-of-way (ROW) or similar work on
ROWowned by others does not require cultural resources survey. The focus of this investigation is the
areas where new ROW would be acquired or new clearing and construction would take place.
For ease of discussion, project area is split into two locations: a northern project area and a southern
project area. The northern project area is located at the intersection Morton Road and Pitts Road, and
totals 47.09 acres of land. Only 20.11 acres of land was subjected to cultural resources survey; the
remaining 26.98 acres of land falls under the 2013 Blanket Clearance Agreement (Appendix A) and does
not require survey. Work within the northern project area includes the replacement of a length of pipe, use
of various workspaces, a proposed hydro test area, and an area for water access.
The southern project area is located just south of Highway 90, and totals 7.66 acres of land. Only 0.47
acres of land was subjected to cultural resources survey; the remaining 7.19 acres of land falls under the
2013 Blanket Clearance Agreement and does not require survey. Work within the southern project area
includes the replacement of a section of pipe and the use of workspace. The project areas are located on
the Brookshire and Katy U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles (Figure 1).
The project work is for the replacement of an existing pipeline. Anticipated construction impacts would
consist of the clearing of vegetation, grading, and the stockpiling of soil. The majority of the work
associated with the various aspects of the projects will take place within the areas that are classified as
existing, previously disturbed, and cleared ROW, and will take place to the depth of the original
disturbance. The workspace needed outside of the previously disturbed areas will be limited. The pipeline
will be installed using the conventional open-cut construction method at a maximum depth of
approximately 5- to 6-feet below the surface. As such, the area of potential effects (APE) encompasses
two areas of land that are 47.09 and 7.66 acres in size; the direct APE encompasses two areas of land that
are 20.11 and 0.47 acres in size.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The proposed project area is located in the Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Ecoregion (Griffith et al 2007).
This ecoregion is characterized by gently sloping coastal plains with vegetation historically dominated by
grasslands marked by sparse stands of oak. Most coastal prairies have since been converted to cropland,
rangeland, pastures, or urban land use. Land use in the proposed project area consists of suburban areas
that give way to rangeland. There are existing pipelines, transmission lines, and buried utilities in the area.

Geology
The geology along both project areas is mapped within the Pleistocene-aged Lissie formation (Ql).
Briefly, the Lissie formation is composed of clay, silt, and sand with some gravels. The surface is
generally flat and featureless, although some depressions or pimple mounds may be present (Barnes
1982).

Soils
There are two specific soils present within the project areas. These include Gessner fine sandy loam (0 to
1 percent slope) and Katy fine sandy loam (0 to 1 percent slope). Both of these soils are derived from
fluviomarine deposits of Early Pleistocene age. Both soils are classified as Alfisols (Natural Resource
Conservation Service [NRCS] 2014).

Houston PALM
The Houston Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) reports the geoarchaeological potential for
the presence of deeply buried archaeological sites. PALM guidelines were developed for the Houston area
by the Texas Department of Transportation (Abbott 2001). The Houston PALM lists the probability for a
named soil to contain buried archaeological deposits. Further guidelines regarding the recommended level
of effort for archaeological surveys within the district are provided according to Map Unit (Abbott 2001).
Gessner fine sandy loam is classified as low-moderate geoarchaeological potential, while Katy fine sandy
loam is classified as low potential.
The project areas are situated in Map Unit 2. Map Unit 2 recommends surface survey only and no deep
reconnaissance is recommended. Map Unit 2 is characterized by areas that have Holocene-era veneers
that are situated on Pleistocene-age landforms (Abbott 2001).

Flora
SWCA biologists conducted a biological survey of the project areas in March 2012 (Ray and Hess 2014).
One vegetation community was identified within the survey area. The community identified occurs as an
herbaceous upland. Herbaceous upland communities occurred throughout the survey area and were
typically found within existing maintained ROW. The dominant herbaceous species within the
herbaceous upland communities were burclover (Medicago polymorpha), southern dewberry (Rubus
trivialis), Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), tumble windmill grass (Chloris verticillata), fragrant
bedstraw (Galium triflorum), and deep-rooted sedge (Cyperus entrerianus) (Ray and Hess 2014).

METHODS
Background Review
The background review consisted of a cultural resources and environmental literature review of the
project area. An SWCA archaeologist reviewed the corresponding USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps on the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas (TASA) online database for any previously
recorded surveys and historic or prehistoric sites located in or near the project area. Site files, relevant
maps, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) listings were
examined. These sources provided information on the nature and location of previously conducted
archaeological surveys and previously recorded cultural resource sites. Aerial photographs, Bureau of
Economic Geology Maps, and the NRCS’s Web Soil Survey, were also examined for historical and
environmental information related to the project area.

Field Methods
The SWCA archaeological investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey augmented with
shovel testing within the APE. The general survey consisted of two archaeologists walking the designated
survey area, examining the ground surface, documenting modifications and disturbances, and utilizing
shovel tests and cutbank exposures to test for subsurface archaeological deposits and assess the
geomorphic setting of the area. Shovel tests were performed in areas that did not show signs of extensive
prior disturbance, and consisted of soils believed to hold the potential for buried deposits close enough to
the surface to be detected through this method of subsurface investigation.
Shovel tests were excavated at 100-m intervals along two to three transects spaced 30 m apart. The
number of transects was determined by the width of the survey areas, depending on the topographic
setting and level of disturbance identified in each segment. Each shovel test measured roughly 30 by 30
cm in size and was excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth or to archaeologically sterile
subsoil. The matrix was screened through ¼-inch mesh. The location of each shovel test was plotted using
a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and each test recorded on project field forms.

RESULTS
Background Review
The background review revealed that two cultural resources surveys have been conducted within a 1-mile
radius of the project areas (TASA 2014). These include a 1985 linear survey conducted for U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency compliance and a 2003 linear survey for Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission compliance. Neither survey identified any cultural resources.
There are no previously recorded archaeological sites, NRHP listed places, or SALs within 1 mile of the
project areas. The closest resource is the Magnolia Cemetery (WL-C021) which is located 1.18 miles to
the southwest of the northern project area.

Field Investigations
On March 5, 2014 SWCA archaeologists investigated the proposed northern and southern project areas.
As previously stated, the cultural resources survey effort was limited to the areas that where new work
will take place and not encompassed by the 2013 Blanket Clearance Agreement.
A total of 26 shovel tests were attempted within the direct APE; of these, 3 shovel tests were not
excavated due to the presence of standing water or disturbance. None of the excavated shovel tests were
positive for cultural material. A detailed description of both the northern and southern survey areas is
presented below.

Northern Project Area
The northern survey area is located at the intersection of Morton Road and Pitts Road (Figure 2 and
Figure 3). The northern project area is irregular in shape and consists of a pipeline corridor, workspace, a
proposed hydro test workspace, and an area for water access. The northern project area encompasses
47.09 acres of land. However, only 20.11 acres of land was subjected to intensive pedestrian survey and
shovel testing. The majority of the shovel tests were placed within the hydro test area; however the
workspaces were also examined (Figure 4 and Figure 5). One portion of the northern project area
consisted entirely of exposed dirt and was subjected to limited pedestrian survey (Figure 6). Some
portions of the project area were covered in standing water (Figure 7).
Within the surveyed areas, 22 shovel tests were attempted. There were two shovel tests that were not
excavated due to the standing water and the presence of a pipeline corridor. A typical shovel test
excavated within the northern survey area had two strata in profile. Stratum I extended from the ground
surface to 50 cmbs and consisted of a layer of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam. Stratum II
extended from the base of Stratum I to 60 cmbs and contained a layer of brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay
with mottles of strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy clay.

The shovel tests were variable throughout the northern project area. They ranged in depth from 30 to 60
cmbs and there were various amounts of mottling present within individual shovel tests. There were
several disturbances visible in the project area including but not limited to existing facilities, man-made
culverts, paved roads, pipeline corridors, and other utility lines. No cultural material or evidence of
cultural material was identified on the ground surface or in shovel tests in this area.

Southern Project Area
The southern project area is located just north of Highway 90 and is irregular in shape (Figure 8 and
Figure 9).Within this area there are workspaces, existing pipeline corridor, culverts, and a driveway. The
southern project area totals 7.66 acres of land; only 0.47 acres of land was subjected to cultural resources
survey. The remaining 7.19 acres of land falls under the 2013 Blanket Clearance Agreement and does not
require survey.
There were four shovel tests attempted within the southern project area. Of these, one was not excavated
due to the presence of standing water and an existing pipeline. A typical shovel test in the area contained
two strata in profile. Stratum I extended from the ground surface to 35 cmbs and contained a layer of dark
yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam. Stratum II extended from the base of Stratum I to 40 cmbs and
consisted of a layer of dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) sandy clay loam.
While only three shovel tests were excavated successfully in the southern project area, they were all
variable. They ranged in depth from 40 to 55 cmbs and each possessed a different soil profile. There were
several disturbances within the surveyed area which included paved roads, a pipeline corridor, culverts,
and existing facilities (Figure 10). Standing water was also present within the surveyed area (Figure 11).
No cultural material or evidence of cultural material was identified on the ground surface or in shovel
tests in this area.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Kinder Morgan, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an archaeological
survey of the proposed TGP MLV 19-2 Pipeline Class Change Replacement Project. Investigations were
performed pursuant to regulatory obligations related to the construction of a natural gas pipeline under a
blanket certificate issued pursuant to Subpart F, Section 157 (201) (206) of the Natural Gas Act and in
accordance with the NHPA. SWCA’s investigations included a background literature and records review
and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing to systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if
possible, determine the significance of any cultural resources located within the project area.
A background literature review shows that only two cultural resources surveys had been conducted within
1 mile of the project areas. Neither survey intersected with the project areas. Additionally, there are no
previously recorded archaeological sites, NRHP listed properties, or SALs present within or adjacent to
the project areas. The closest cultural resource is a cemetery that is located 1.18 mile southwest of the
northern project area.
A total of 26 shovel tests were attempted within the northern and southern project areas. None of these
were positive for cultural material and no evidence of cultural features was identified. Overall, both the
northern and southern project areas showed evidence of excessive disturbance. The excavated shovel tests
were highly variable and mottled and in some areas exposed earth was documented. Other disturbances
included a transmission corridor, pipeline corridor, paved roads, culverts, and other facilities observed
within the project areas. There were also areas that were under standing water.
Based on the results of the current survey effort, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed project would
have NO EFFECT TO HISTORIC PROPERTIES. As such, SWCA recommends no further
archaeological investigation of the currently defined project area and the project be allowed to proceed.
