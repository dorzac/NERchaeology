ABSTRACT

Historic and archaeological research was carried out in downtown Fort
Worth as part of planning for the Tarrant County College Downtown
Campus. The campus includes an eighteen acre track in the West Fork
floodplain on the east side of North Main Street as well as an eleven acre
tract on the adjacent bluff the over looks the river and floodplain. Historic
research indicated that the area has been continuously occupied since the
late 1800s but failed to find evidence of occupation when Fort Worth was
established. Deep archaeological testing in the floodplain found no buried
cultural resources but did discover contaminated soils. Artifacts from the
early 1900s were found in mixed contexts north of Bluff Street in
downtown Fort Worth. Trenching and shovel testing failed to find any
evidence of undisturbed site deposits although this area was recorded as
site 41TR211 at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Based on
the excavation findings, it is expected that when the parking lots are
removed that mixed historic artifacts and structural remains will be found
south of Bluff Street. However, except for sealed deposits that may be
present in cisterns and privies, we do not anticipate finding archaeological
contexts that will be worthy of further investigation unless the college or
the city wants to gather a sample of unprovenienced artifacts. AR
Consultants recommends that the project proceed as planned but that
personnel be advised to stop and notify the appropriate authorities if
significant archaeological resources are encountered.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
AR Consultants wants to thank the many people of Fort Worth who provided us with
information about the history and prehistory of the Tarrant County College Downtown
Campus site. We are grateful to Dr. Paula Vastine from the Tarrant County College
Northeast Campus for her research on the Anchor Fence Co. In particular we want to
thank Janice Lambert and David Pettit of GideonToal for their help and encouragement
throughout the study.
Greg Ritenour of The Projects Group was keenly interested in how we were exploring for
buried sites in the Trinity River floodplain. Mark Gregory of TXU visited the site and
informed us of some buried TXU lines and offered advise on digging near the TXU
substation. Don Blair of Austin Commercial offered advise about our subsurface finds.
Greg Gaskie of GideonToal was at the job site during excavation and helped with the
paperwork and was very helpful in getting the excavations done in two days. Last but not
least, we want to thank Randy Reagan, the trackhoe owner and operator, for pitching in
with the excavation.

INTRODUCTION
GideonToal of Fort Worth contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to conduct a cultural
resources investigation of the proposed Tarrant County College Downtown Campus
(TCC) site which consists of two parts, the bluff site and the floodplain site as described
herein (Figure 1). The bluff site includes eleven acres located on the top and slope of the
bluff that overlooks the West Fork of the Trinity River and is situated just east of the
Tarrant County Courthouse and the North Main Street Bridge over the West Fork. The
area includes Blocks 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Bluff Street is set back from the bluff edge
and parcels 13120 and 23540 include the bluff edge and the slope down to near the river
level. Parts or all of these tracts are presently used as parking lots or contain standing
structures. No investigations have been done in the paved areas or at the standing
structures. On the north side of the river, the floodplain site is approximately 7 acres and
is on the east side of North Main Street. Parcel 106 is east of the river bridge and is
largely undeveloped although it includes the Old Ocean Fuel Metering Station easement.
The historic research for this property was initiated early on and there have been some
changes in the land acquisition. For example, the floodplain section of the project has
been reduced significantly. The original plan included the old power plant west of North
Main Street (Figure 2). The present configuration is shown on Figure 1.
Geotechnical exploration of the bluff tract (Fugro South, Inc 1999) revealed that the soil
on the bluff top between Bluff Street and the bluff edge is shallow and rests on limestone
bedrock. The bluff edge however, has been extended to the north by two distinctly
different episodes of âfillâ being placed on top of the original ground surface and on the
gently sloping bluff edge. These fill episodes appear to contain the remains of demolished
structures, roadways, sidewalks, and foundations that were pushed over the bluff edge in
order to conveniently dispose of them. They are also mixed with small amounts of
domestic trash dated to the late 1800s and early 1900s.
Over the past several years, AR Consultants has conducted several investigations in the
vicinity of the campus site. The first of these was prior to the construction of the West
Fork Relief Sewer Line (Trask et al. 1994; Skinner et al. 1997) which was bored under
the courthouse and crossed the Tandy parking lot before crossing the Clear Fork of the
Trinity River. Trackhoe trenches were excavated on both sides of the Clear Fork and one
confirmed that much of the parking lot had been built on construction fill such as that
known to be contained in the fill at the bluff edge in Parcels 13120 and 23540. No buried
cultural materials were found on the west bank of the Clear Fork or in the floodplain of
the West Fork just west of Parcel 582. Radiocarbon dating (TX-8949) just above the
water level resulted in a determination that less than three meters of sediment has been
deposited in the floodplain during the past 1700 years. A similar pattern is to be expected
in the parcels on the north side of the river. Dragline testing at the site of the Beach Street
Weir revealed no buried paleosols or other evidence of deeply buried cultural materials
(Skinner and Trask 1999).

More recently, ARC conducted an investigation of Blocks 9, 10, 11, and 23 for Tarrant
County Facilities Management (Trask and Skinner 2000). The purpose of this
investigation was to evaluate the archaeological potential of the four contiguous blocks.

No archaeological sites had been recorded but Sanborn Insurance maps showed that
between 1885 and 1926 the property had changed from a mixed business/dwelling
configuration to a strictly business setting. Virtually none of the buildings recorded on the
1885 maps were extant in 1926 and very few of the 1926 buildings remained in 2000. It
was concluded that this area had a very low potential for containing preserved historic
archaeological deposits other than possibly the lower portions of outhouses, cisterns, or
root cellars. Likewise, the potential of finding prehistoric deposits was considered low
due to historic impacts upon the bluff top despite the fact that the bluff top is a likely area
to have been occupied prehistorically.

The following chapter is a slightly modified version of a report titled âHistoric Context
for TCC Downtown Property Assemblyâ and prepared by Cornerstone Heritage
Preservation Services (2005). The report address historic resources in the two study areas,
but also includes information from adjacent properties in the Bluff area. It should be
noted that the Cornerstone report was prepared in the spring of 2005 before demolition of
the TXU property was carried out; consequently some of the recommendations presented
in the chapter are no longer relevant but they have been retained to preserve the integrity

HISTORIC CONTEXT
This report is a historic context for the Tarrant County Community College Campus
Property Assembly in Downtown Fort Worth, Texas. This project involved researching
and documenting the development of the project areas. The purpose of the research was
to identify areas of prolonged occupation that had not been disturbed and might yield
archaeological remains. The subject areas are east of the area thought to be the location of
the fort. Recommendations are made about locations that may yield archaeological finds.
In addition, recommendations are offered for documentation of extant properties.
In developing the historic context for this project, Cornerstone HPS researched and
reviewed a wide array of original records and maps. It is important to note that there is no
1860 census for the United States and that the Tarrant County Courthouse burned in 1876
destroying all records. Current maps were overlain on historic maps of the subject areas.
The two primary Areas were surveyed and researched as outlined below in items 1-3.
1. Preliminary Preparation and Orientation: Initial familiarization through general
research; investigating local research facilities as well as the internet; acquiring maps for
field work.
2. Field Work: Walking and driving survey of both areas to locate all resources;
photographing all resources, and making field notes.
3. Block Assessment: Each block will be researched and documented. A brief description
of the development of each block will be included in the report.
Information Gathering: Research history of areas as they relate to land uses and structures
by utilizing legal research, historic photographs, maps including Sanborns, utilizing other
background information and existing local histories and resources.
The current physical condition of each block was noted including number of extant
structures and approximate date of construction. Recommendations for excavation
potential are included.
Historic Context Related to the Development of Fort Worth and North Fort Worth
A. History of Fort Worth - Overview
Major Ripley A. Arnold established Camp Worth as a U.S. Army fort in 1849 to serve as
protection of the frontier against incursions by hostile Indians of Texas. The United
States government had ordered a line of posts to extend from the Red River in a
southwesterly direction to the Rio Grande River. The military post was established June
6, 1849 and was named for General William Jenkins Worth. Major Arnold established
the first camp near a grove of live oak trees near Cold Springs, but due to excessive
flooding the Camp was moved to higher ground at the top of the bluffs, west of the
present-day Tarrant County Courthouse. The camp was located on a bluff overlooking
the confluence of the West Fork and Clear Fork of the Trinity River.

By November 1849, the name of the camp was named Fort Worth in honor of General
Worth. The fort contained three officerâs quarters, a barracks, hospital, stables,
commissary, guardhouse and storehouse. In September 1853, Colonel W.G. Freeman
inspected the fort and drew a plan of the commanding officerâs quarters, barracks, guard
house and other structures (Figure 2).

William B. Potter showing proximity of
the bluff.

National Archives, Washington, D.C.
The army closed the fort in 1853 as the frontier moved westward (Figure 3). The settlers
who had moved into the area remained at the fort site and established their businesses in
the remaining fort structures. Although the exact location of the Fort is unknown,
according to historical research conducted by Frances M. Allen between 1980 and 1983,
the Fort could have been located in three areas all west of the Tarrant County Courthouse
(Figure 4).
Farming was the main economic activity and soon other settlers moved into the area.
John Peter Smith opened the first school in 1854. Fort Worth won a contested race for
county seat against Birdville in 1856. By 1860, Fort Worth was a thriving community of
450 and Tarrant County had 6,000 people. The Civil War was destructive for Tarrant
County and Fort Worth. Tarrant Countyâs population dropped to 5,788 and Fort Worthâs
population fell to half of pre-war levels to 225 people.

After the Civil War, Fort Worth began to recover economically with the cattle drives that
came through on the Chisholm Trail driving the cattle up to the railhead in Abilene,
Kansas. Fort Worth was the last stop in Texas as the herds moved north. By the late
1860âs and early 1870s, Fort Worth had become a bustling cattle town, âCowtownâ.
But Fort Worth would not become truly viable until the railroads came through providing
a vital transportation link to markets throughout the United States and bringing goods to
town. Unfortunately, the first prospect, the Texas and Pacific Railroad stopped
construction just west of Dallas because of the Panic of 1873. Fort Worth had to wait
another three years (1876) until the railroad proceeded west (Figure 5). Now, ranchers
could ship their cattle by rail from Fort Worth instead of enduring a long trail drive.
A gas plant was constructed in 1876, followed by gas lamps along the downtown streets.
Artesian wells were drilled in 1878. The first waterworks opened in 1882 and by 1886, an
electric light power plant was built supplying more streetlights to the city. Fort Worth
grew to 16,000 in population by 1887 (Figure 6). The first electric streetcar started
operating in 1890, linking the downtown to new growth in the southern and northern
sectors (Figure 7). This same year, the population burgeoned to 23,000. Within 17 years,

eight railroad lines came through Fort Worth. In the late 1880s, the town of North Fort
Worth had been platted but it was not incorporated until 1902.

Community leaders were trying to reap more economic gain from the cattle industry. The
cattle came to Fort Worth and were shipped north and east. However, the Texas cattle
were more often than not infected with ticks that lead to a temporary ban. Fort Worth
officials thought they could alleviate this problem by establishing packing plants in the
city. Unfortunately, this strategy did not work in part because refrigerated train cars had
not been perfected.
By 1902, civic leaders revisited the meat packing issue and raised $100,000 and located a
site for the facility to entice a major meat packing business to town. Both Amour and
Swift companies of Chicago responded and subsequently built their facilities in the town

of North Fort Worth. Meatpacking became an economic engine for Fort Worth until the
oil fields of North and West Texas were discovered in the late teens and early 1920s.

square along the bluff of the Trinity River. Courtesy Fort Worth Public
Library.

The cityâs population grew to 73,312 by 1910. Part of that was the addition of North Fort
Worth that was annexed by the city in 1909. However, it was not until 1923 that the area
known as Niles City that included the stockyards and the packing plants was annexed into
the city limits. Four separate power companies were merged into the Fort Worth Power
and Light Company (later Texas Electric Service Company, then Texas Power and Light,
now Texas Utilities) in 1911 and the next year a new power plant was built on the north
side of the Trinity River across from the Tarrant County Courthouse. Lake Worth Dam
was completed in 1914.
The city was reorganized under a series of boards and commissions in 1906. They hired
George Kessler to develop a master plan for parks and boulevards. He completed the plan
in 1909. He proposed the courthouse as a focal point of the cityâs park and boulevard
plan. As with many of Kesslerâs Plans, only a few of the recommendations were ever
carried out. By 1912, Fort Worthâs Chamber of Commerce was organized.

It was at this time, 1911, that oil was discovered on W.T. Waggonerâs ranch near Wichita
Falls. This was followed by the discovery of oil at the Ranger fields in 1917, Desdemona
and Breckenridge in 1918 and, later in 1921-1929, the Permian Basin. Fort Worth was
the largest city near the fields and it had the financial infrastructure to handle this new
industry. Fort Worth grew dramatically both in population and wealth. Fort Worth was an
important refining center with the construction of the Gulf Oil Refinery in 1911, the
Pierce Oil refinery the next year and Magnolia Petroleum in 1914. These companies,
along with several independents, oil equipment suppliers and jobbers, established
facilities just across the Trinity from downtown in the near North Side. The petroleum
industry literally built downtown Fort Worth of the 1920s and 1930s. Many of the large
oil companies had substantial offices in downtown, even buildings developed for them
such as the Sinclair building. The petroleum industry helped Fort Worth stave off the
worst effects of the Great Depression until 1933. By 1920, the cityâs population was over
100,000 and by 1930 it was over 163,000. As mentioned above, Niles City, the area
where the stockyards and meatpacking companies were located was finally annexed into
the city along with Polytechnic Heights, Riverside and Arlington Heights, the former
U.S. Army training facility known as Camp Bowie.
The Great Depression impacted Fort Worth but not as severely as other parts of the
United States. This was due to the several factors. First, the city of Fort Worth changed
its charter in 1925 to a manager/council form of government and could focus on long
neglected municipal improvements. Next, civic leaders and politicians developed a
comprehensive bond package and voters approved it thus enabling the âFive Year Planâsâ

success. And finally, the federal and local government construction of public buildings,
overpasses, street widening and repaving complemented the utilities and private sector
building program.
The private sector, led by the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, the Young Men's
Business League and the Manufacturer and Wholesalers Association, consolidated and
developed the five-year work program. These groups had been working separately on
several issues (Fort Worth Star-Telegram Feb. 14, 1927). This new comprehensive
program, begun in January 1928, combined these issues and was implemented under the
"One Hundred Million Dollar Construction and Improvement Program". The program's
ten goals included securing a union railroad depot, completion of the Tarrant County road
building program, promotion and trade extension through every possible avenue, aid to
local industries and wholesale and retail establishments and development of the Fort
Worth Market through the location of additional wholesale houses. In a short span of five
years, a phenomenal number of major structures were built mainly in the immediate
downtown area.
The Five Year Plan helped to stave off the worst effects of the Depression until about
1933 (Keaveney 1974:147). In the Chamber of Commerce's own assessment of the Plan,
they state, âDespite the fact that three of the five years embraced in the work program
have been years of great depression, the progress Fort Worth has made must be a matter
of civic pride" (Chamber, Introduction). A combination of Fort Worth's building spurt,
the West Texas oil wealth and proactive city and private employment policies helped to
negate the first two years of the Depression. That building boom, fueled by the wealth
generated by the West Texas oil fields helped to ease the rate of unemployment (Cotner
1973:35). The city council and local leadership urged the hiring of only local workers
whenever possible (Keaveney 1971:35). Construction in Fort Worth was valued at $30.7
million for January 1930. The city budget for that year included $300 million for local
construction. Leaders of local industries including Fort Worth Power and Light (later
TESCO) agreed to expand their businesses to bolster employment (FWST Nov. 28, 1929:
1). However, by the close of 1932, the large building projects undertaken by the city and
private sector were completed. Banks began to fail the previous year, and by 1933, Fort
Worth experienced the full force of the Depression (Cohen1982: 89). Again, in the short
term, the Five Year Plan lessened the Depression's impact for the first few years. Long
range, the new infrastructure improvements and buildings aided Fort Worth through the
Depression and War years until construction could resume. As a result of the growth
from 1928 to 1932, Fort Worth was physically able to move into the post war years
absorbing expanded housing needs and increased traffic (Taylor 1992). During this time,
until 1941, the federal government spent more than $15 million locally through new Deal
programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Public Works Administration and
others.
Also, the fledgling aviation industry helped to move Fort Worth out of the Depression
and into a new economic era. The aviation industry began during World War I when
pilots from Britain and Canada were trained at three fields in Fort Worth. Later,
American pilots would be trained at the fields. Fort Worth must have realized the

potential because the city appropriated money to buy 526 acres of land northwest of the
city limits. This land was later offered to the federal government for an aircraft plant site.
In 1942, CONVAIR (Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation, later General Dynamics,
now Lockheed Martin) started production of B-24 Liberator bombers. During the war
years, this plant employed as many as 30,000 people. Tarrant Field, located next to the
plant, became Carswell Air Force base in 1948. By the mid-1950s, Fort Worth had more
than 400 manufacturing plants and a population of over 280,000 people. By 1960, the
population had risen to 356,000.

B. History of North Fort Worth - Overview
The near North Side was one of the earliest industrial areas in the city outside of the
immediate downtown. The industrialization of this district began as early as 1889 when
the North Side Street Rail Road Company built its powerhouse and car house on the site
of what is now the TU power plant (See Figure 10, Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps 1889:
17). The area grew more industrial with time, reaching its height in the 1940s and 1950s.
The buildings and structures housed companies and industries that shaped the economic
fortunes of Fort Worth from the turn of the century until the mid-1950s.
Although the district was initially platted residential, like most river bottom areas in
cities, it became industrial. Land in an area like this was not desirable for residential
development due to its proximity to an unpredictable river, major railroad tracks,
irregular size land parcels and that it sat literally in the bottoms between downtown and
North Fort Worth.
North Fort Worth and North Main Street were originally platted in the late 1880s (See
Figure . In 1888, the Fort Worth City Company bought nearly 2,500 acres from the
Trinity River north to what is now North Twentieth Street. The businessmen of the Fort
Worth City Company included A.T. Byers, W.A. Huffman and John Peter Smith. They
hired Nathan Barrett, a New York City landscape architect to draw a plan and plat for the
new community of North Fort Worth (Figure 9) (Pate, 1994). Barrett had collaborated on
the 1880 Plan for Pullman, Illinois. He was influenced in his designs by the great
landscape architect, Fredrick Law Olmstead (Tarrant County Historic Resources Survey
Near North Side 1990: 3). The plan brought Main Street North across the Trinity as a
long thoroughfare where Barrett platted streets parallel to North Main in long blocks.
The majority of the area was platted for residential development including North Main
from the river to the St. Louis, San Francisco and Texas Railroad tracks that cross North
Main Street. At the same time the plat was being developed, plans were being made for a
streetcar line and a bridge across the Trinity. Of course, the developers wanted, and
needed, a more substantial bridge across the Trinity and a streetcar line to encourage the
purchase of lots in their new community. Byers and Huffman formed the North Fort
Worth Streetcar Company with John Peter Smith, John Templeton and Wint Patterson.
They worked together to construct the streetcar line from downtown out North Main to
the Fort Worth Stockyards. A Detroit firm had the contract to complete a ten and a half

mile track for the electric streetcar at the cost of $60,000. The streetcar line was operable
by the summer of 1889 and is shown on the Sanborn Fire Insurance Map of that year. The
map states that the North Side Street Rail Road Companyâs Electric Power House was
located about 225 feet from the Trinity River. An artesian well and pump were located
adjacent to the powerhouse. The car house was also located on North Main about one and
a quarter miles from the Court House (Sanborn Fire Insurance Map, 1889: 17). By July
1889, the streetcar line was in operation.
Even the development of the Armour and Swift plants in 1902 did not bring explosive
growth to this area like they did for the areas surrounding the stockyards. Earlier
stockyards under varying names had not been particularly successful. The latest
incarnation, the Fort Worth Packing and Provision Company, showed modest success.
Noting this, the Fort Worth Board of Trade began negotiations to lure a major
meatpacking company to the area. The City and the Board of Trade raised $100,000 to
entice a plant to North Fort Worth. As expected the enticement worked and both Armour
and Swift agreed to build packing plants on the North Side. Although the streetcar line
had been completed, it still took several years before the development of North Main
began in earnest. Early City Directories and Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps show only a
few residents and businesses in the area known as Trinity Bottoms.
The City of North Fort Worth was incorporated in 1902 using Nathaniel Barrettâs original
plat design. However, the near North Side area, platted for residential, never had many
houses but heavy industrial uses developed instead. Evidence of the more commercial
and industrial nature of the area can also be seen on the 1911 Sanborn Fire Insurance
Maps that show at the site of the current North Main Power Plant (the west side of Main
Street at North Second) was Hermann Park, across North Second Street was Fort Worth
Granite and Marble Works. Fort Worth Machine and Foundry was located directly across
North Main Street. By 1909, the City of Fort Worth had annexed the City of North Forth
Worth.
As the North Fort Worth area became more populated with Anglo settlers other forms of
recreation developed. As early as 1898 Hermann Park appears on Sanborn Insurance
Maps. Located on the northwest block of North Main Street and North Second Street, the
park featured a beer garden and dancing pavilion. Immigrants from Germany, Poland,
Austria, Russia, Greece and other foreign countries came to Fort Worth in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries and settled between Calhoun and Commerce Streets and Twentysecond and Twenty-third Streets (Pate 1994:54). During weekend evenings, members of
the Sons of Hermann in addition to others would gather to hear German bands play and
dance to lively waltzes and polkas.

The Cityâs early enthusiasm for the oil industry is evident in the City Directory of 1918.
It states that Fort Worth âis an oil center of owning to wonderful transportation facilities,
an oil center of North Texas and South Oklahoma fieldsâ (City Directory 1918:8).
Industrial and manufacturing businesses continued to move into the area. By the 1920s
and 1930s, there were 11 oil and oil related businesses in the area. Humble Refining,
Owenwood Oil Corporation, Waggoner Refining Company, Magnolia Oil (warehouse),
American Oil and Continental Oil were all in the area. Humble Refining was located on
the west side of North Main along the railroad tracks by the TP&L Power Plant at North
4th Street West.
The flood of 1949 devastated the area. The TP&L plant was surrounded by water but did
not flood. Throughout the 1950âs and into the 1960âs the patterns of companies in the
near North Side remained the same. TESCO (TXU) continued to expand the North Main
Plant in 1952 and into the 1960âs. They replaced a small building owned by the Corps of
Engineers with one of their own in 1964. It is located facing North Fourth Street West
between North Main and Houston.

C. The Growth of Transportation
1. Cattle Trails
In Fort Worth, the trail crossed the West Fork of the Trinity River and veered to the
northwest leading near the Wise-Denton county line. Nearing the Red River, the herds
were led through open prairies with plenty of grass for grazing (Gard 1954:78-79). One
of the earliest documented accounts of herds entering Fort Worth was made by Mary
Daggett Lake. In the spring of 1866 Colonel J.J. Meyers of Lockhart, Texas came
through Fort Worth on his was to Sedalia, Missouri. Cattle arrived in Fort Worth south of
downtown near present-day South Hemphill Street, turned northeastward through the
future Texas and Pacific Railroad yards, headed north along present Commerce and Jones
Streets, passed on the eastern side of the Pioneerâs Rest Cemetery, then followed the Cold
Springs Road to Daggettâs Crossing. They crossed the Trinity River about half a mile
from the present stockyards area (Pate 1994:17).

2. Railroads
Transportation was integral to the growth and development of Fort Worth. Like many
Texas towns and cities, the growth of the city was tied initially to railroads. Then, within
the city and before automobiles, mule drawn, followed by electric, streetcar lines
provided transportation from home to work and back again. They were used to take
people to church, school and shopping. Streetcars were the only mode of transportation
most middle and lower class people had until the mass production of Henry Fordâs Model
A and Ts. Along with the streetcars came the bridges and roads needed to traverse the
city and to travel to new residential subdivisions. This was especially important for the
near North Side and the North Side because of the physical barrier of the Trinity River.

The Railroads played a major role in the development of Fort Worth as it did for most
cities in Texas and the West. The development the Stockyards and other industries of the
near North Side and the North Side are closely linked to the development of the Railroads
and access to them. After a false start, the Texas and Pacific Railroad finally reached Fort
Worth in 1876. B.B. Paddock, newspaper editor and booster for Fort Worth, designed a
map he called the Tarantula map, showing several railroads emanating from Fort Worth
(Jackson 1996). It took several years but by 1900, the Missouri, Kansas and Texas
(Katy), the Santa Fe, Fort Worth and New Orleans, the Fort Worth and Denver City, the
Fort Worth and Brownwood, the Fort Worth and Rio Grande, the Fort Worth, Corsicana
and Beaumont, and the St. Louis Southwestern (Cotton Belt) railroads were all operating
in Fort Worth (Handbook of Texas Online). The Saint Louis, San Francisco and Texas
was soon to follow.
Some of these railroads turned north through the near North Side and North Fort Worth:
the St. Louis, San Francisco and Texas, the St. Louis Southwestern (Cotton Belt) and the
Fort Worth and Denver City. As they were built, and soon after, sidings were added to
aid in the growth and development of the near North Side and North Fort Worth. The St.
Louis Southwestern had a siding going north in the middle of North Commerce Street
and one on North Houston Street (Sanborn Fire Insurance Map 1910, corrected to
1951:366:369). The Fort Worth Denver City Railroad was chartered in 1873 with the
help of Major Van Zandt, head of the Fort Worth National Bank. Van Zandt also served
on the board of the railroad until is death in 1930. One of the promoters of the line,
Warren Lawrence had been pushing a line from the Gulf of Mexico to Denver via Fort
Worth since 1869. The financial panic of 1873 halted construction on most of the rail
lines in the area including the Texas and Pacific line and the Fort Worth and Denver City.
Grenville M. Dodge, known for constructing lines for Union Pacific and Texas and
Pacific, came in to build the FW&DC. He, along with the Gould syndicate, formed the
Texas and Colorado Railroad Improvement Company to construct the line (Jackson
1996:65). By September of 1882, 110 miles of track had been built to Wichita Falls and
by March of 1888 the line to Denver had been completed. In 1925, the Fort Worth
Denver City acquired trackage rights to go between Dallas and Fort Worth.
These railroads, in their various incarnations and at one time or another, had tracks and
sidings in the near North Side and North Fort Worth. The railroads and the industries had
a symbiotic relationship: one could not grow and prosper without the other. The
development of the near North Side into an industrial area was due in part to excellent
access to the railroad lines that passed through Fort Worth.

3. Street Car Lines in the Near North Side
The streetcar lines in a city provided effective transportation to people of all income
levels. They were an integral part of the development of a city. Fort Worth was no
different from many of the other cities across the country who had developers who owned
the streetcar lines and vice versa. Men like Sam Rosen who built a line to tie his
residential development Rosen Heights to downtown and A.T. Byers and W.A. Huffman

who developed the North Main Street line as well as platting the original North Fort
Worth Townsite were conscious of the fact that no residential development would
succeed without adequate transportation.
On July 20, 1887, the Fort Worth Daily Gazette reported that the City of Fort Worth had
passed an ordinance granting the North Side Railway Company the right to construct a
line from North Main south to the Union Depot (WPA 1936-41:12788-90). About a year
and a half later, W.A. Huffman and A.T. Byers negotiated with the Fort Worth Street Car
Company to lease their lines which included the Main Street Line, the Union Line and the
Belt Line. These lines were operated by the North Fort Worth Street Car Company for a
period of five years. The company built an extension of the Main Street line out North
Main Street to the Union Stock Yards, an investment of approximately $30,000 (WPA
1936-41: 12788-90 quoting Daily Gazette Nov. 29 1888). A few months later in January
1889, W.A. Huffman, John Peter Smith, John Templeton, A.T. Byers and Wint Patterson,
formed the North Side Railway Company and closed on a contract with Detroit Electric
works for equipment to build the streetcar lines. By July 1889, cars were running up and
down North Main (WPA 1936-41: 12788-90 Daily Gazette July 1889). The powerhouse
for the streetcar line was located on the west side of North Main Street approximately
225 feet from the courthouse. There was an artesian well and steam pump located nearby
(Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps 1898:17).
Another developer who built his own streetcar line was Sam Rosen. He purchased a large
tract of land west of North Main at approximately Twenty-Fifth Street on rumors that
Armour and Swift were constructing meatpacking plants on the North Side (Pate
1994:40). Like all the other developers, Rosen knew his residential development would
not be successful unless it was there was easy access to a streetcar line. In 1904, Rosen
went to the North Fort Worth City Council to ask for a franchise and permission to
construct track on city streets. His plans were approved and Rosen began to construct the
line. He then went to the Northern Texas Traction Company (North Side Railway
Company) to work out an agreement with them to tie into their North Main Street line.
This action was similar to what was done to construct the North Main Street line. The
partners refused and Rosen was crushed. He knew he must have a streetcar line for his
development to succeed. Instead, he went back to the city councils for both cities
permission to construct a streetcar line from downtown Fort Worth over the Trinity
through the near North Side and into North Fort Worth. The streetcar line was built
including a bridge across the Trinity just to the west of the North Main Street Bridge
(Pate 1994:40-41). The Northern Texas Traction Company purchased Sam Rosenâs line
and one other streetcar line in 1906 (Pate 1994:46).
In 1938 the Fort Worth Transit Company asked the City Council for permission to
complete its conversion from electric streetcars to buses (FWST Dec. 26, 1938 Clipping
File). The company was trying work out an arrangement for removal of the tracks with a
financial commitment from the city to pay for a portion of the removal cost. The city
planned to use federal money for track removal but that proposal was turned down by the
Works Progress Administration. Instead, the city applied to the WPA for street repaving

where the tracks had lain. This expenditure was approved by the WPA. By the early
1940s, the tracks were removed and the streets repaired.

D. Industry and Development
1. Discovery of Oil in West Texas and its impact on Fort Worth
In October 1917, an oil well drilled in Ranger, Texas came in with a full gusher. This
discovery was soon followed by the Desdemona, Breckenridge and Permian Basin fields.
Fort Worth, situated 90 miles east of Ranger, was the closest city to these fields. The
West Texas oil fields had a great impact on the development of Fort Worth from a town
into a viable metropolitan city. Oil literally paid for several major downtown buildings
(the Texas Hotel, Blackstone, Sinclair Building, and Petroleum Building) and for the
expansion of railroads, pipelines and other oil related industries.
Fort Worth was surrounded by oil fields and the fields were constantly growing. Oil was
piped to Fort Worth through a network of pipelines that made the city one of the largest
pipeline centers in the world. Fort Worth became the largest in-land refining center in
Texas with oil refineries including Gulf Oil, Pierce Oil Company and Magnolia
Petroleum. By 1928 Texas was the largest oil producer in the country with approximately
one fifth of that oil coming directly to Fort Worth for processing.
During the height of the oil years, there were approximately 600 firms connected to the
industry including oil companies, independent operators, geologists, drilling contractors,
manufacturers and jobbers of oil field supplies. In the 1920s, these companies represented
an investment of more than $15 million and an average annual output of $20 million.
Companies, large like Sinclair and smaller independents, had their offices downtown.
However, their auxiliary offices and refining areas were located on the North Side.
The companies with facilities on the North Side included Magnolia Petroleum, Humble
Oil and Refining, Continental Oil, Waggoner Refining Company as well as smaller
independents Panther Oil and Grease and Graham-Penn Oil Company.
However, by 1931 the oil industry was facing problems. The Great Depression had
started in 1929 and by 1931, the price for oil had dropped to 8 cents a barrel. The larger
producers were interested in oil regulation while the small producers wanted to get any
money they could. Obviously, the large companies won out and regulation was instituted
but not without a major fight.
It is important to reiterate that the oil industry, despite its own problems during the Great
Depression, did help Fort Worth stave off the worst effects until 1933. The oil money
helped construct many of the major buildings in downtown, provided jobs and revenues
to the city. This, in turn, enabled the city to construct roads, bridges and other facilities
that provided work for many local citizens.

2. Fort Worth Power and Light/TESCO/TXU Power Plant
The North Main Power Plant constructed in 1910 is a representation of the dominant role
that utility companies played in the economic growth and vitality of cities and towns
across the state of Texas. The physical plant located on North Main grew as the demands
for power in the city and region grew. It also became a symbol of the growth and
consolidation of the power companies in Texas.
Begun in 1885 as Fort Worth Electric Light and Power Company, the business soon
merged with Fort Worth Gaslight Company to become the only supplier of gas and
electricity in the city. Competing power companies soon formed. However, even with
three power companies to choose from, the quality of service was poor and there were
frequent disruptions of power and, the power was usually too expensive for most
households and businesses to afford. Even the street car lines that provided power as well
were unreliable. In 1911, changes occurred with a court ordered auction of Citizens
Railway and Light Company. Citizens Railway was purchased by Fort Worth Power and
Light, beginning the orderly consolidation of the various power companies. From this,
three companies emerged: Fort Worth Power and Light providing electricity; Fort Worth
Gas providing natural gas, and Northern Texas Traction Company providing
transportation. Mr. J.R. Nutt became chairman of the board of this newly consolidated
company and Mr. A.J. Duncan became president and general manager.
Already the construction of the North Main Power Plant was underway when the
consolidation occurred. Mr. Nutt financed the consolidation, the completion of the plant
and a citywide system through the Electric Bond and Share Company. The North Main
Power Plant with two 4,000-kilowatt turbo-generators was completed and began
operation in late 1912. Just before completion of the plant, another generator was added
to supply power, through a contract Nutt had negotiated, to the new Dallas-Waco
Interurban. This brought the capacity of the plant to 13,000 kilowatts (Gillmore, 1976).
The new power plant provided reliable and economical power to residential, commercial
and industrial users. Up to that time, many commercial and industrial users had
maintained their own generators because electric power was unreliable and expensive.
The new power plant used coal for fuel that was brought in by a railroad spur located on
the west side of the plant. By 1921, fuel oil was introduced and both coal and fuel oil
were used at the plant. Around 1925, the plant started using natural gas for fuel.
The need for expanded electric service in Fort Worth, especially downtown, demanded
more generating capacity. From 1913 to 1929, Fort Worth's population increased from
75,000 to 163,000. The number of customers served by Fort Worth Power and Light
during this time grew from 9,474 to 38,510; with total annual sales increasing from 24
million kilowatt hours to 153.5 million, and annual revenues grew from $707,200 to
$3,446,467. By 1928, the 4,000-volt underground system that served the burgeoning
downtown area became inadequate and was converted to 12,500 volts. This was not
completed until after 1929 when the company was purchased by Texas Electric Service
Company (TESCO) (Gillmore, 1976). The plant was expanded twice during this time: in

1918, when more capacity was added due to the increase in electrical use that occurred
when Camp Bowie, one of the largest military camps in the Southwest was located in
Fort Worth (It was later closed and moved to Brownwood) and again in 1922 (Gillmore,
1976).
Apparently, there has only been one instance when the plant has been shut down. On
April 24, 1922, when the Trinity River flooded and rose to cover 3,000 acres, killing 37
people and left many more homeless in addition to destroying countless businesses. Even
the flood of 1949 did not close the plant completely.
On December 19, 1929, TESCO incorporated, consolidating Fort Worth Power and Light
and Texas Electric Service Company. TESCO included electric power facilities in rural
communities in North Central and West Texas including Oil Cities Electric Company.
TESCO and another prominent, growing utility concern Texas Power and Light both
operated as separate subsidiary companies of American Power and Light.
Throughout the 1920's and early 1930's, there was a steady increase of electric meter
installation and company expansion. The company expanded its power plant to
accommodate the residential growth occurring on the west side of Fort Worth in
Arlington Heights. Like most utility companies even today, Fort Worth Power and Light
(later TESCO) was actively involved with recruiting new industries to Fort Worth. In the
early 1920's, TESCO was particularly successful in bringing two large meat packing
companies to town. TESCO also launched intensive commercial sales promotion to
secure large industrial power users. They were able to add as clients a cement mill and a
textile mill as well as many of the new refineries opening in Fort Worth. These industries
located on the north side of town. In 1927, there were 32,946 meters in Fort Worth; in
1928, 34,369; in 1929, 39,518; in 1930, 40,876; in 1931, 41,930 and in 1932, 42,351. To
coincide with these increases, TESCO obtained money from bonds and preferred stock to
finance ongoing system development. In 1930, TESCO spent $987,432 and in 1932,
$1,875,000 for upgrading their system (Gillmore, 1976).
However, by 1932, as the Depression finally caught up to Fort Worth and TESCO, these
numbers dropped dramatically and in 1933, $3,000,000 was spent and in 1935, only
$235,000 was spent on system development. The company's revenues began declining as
early as 1932. Employees grew apprehensive, fearing layoffs. The company reduced
salaries by 10% instead of instituting layoffs. Finally, when reductions were needed,
single women living at home were let go first, then single men. Even the employee
newsletter was a casualty of the Depression. Promotions such as selling electric waffle
irons for $.13 down and 13 months to pay the remainder of the $4.95 price were used
mainly for customer sales campaigns during the Depression. A bottle of cooking oil was
given as a premium. Construction by the company during this time was with local labor
in hopes of easing the unemployment situation. It is important to note that TESCO, as
part of the Five Year Plan developed by the City of Fort Worth and the Chamber of
Commerce, agreed to expand their business and hire locally to bolster the failing local
economy during the Depression (FWST Nov. 28, 1929: 1).

During the Depression, TESCO lost income on what were known as "jumpers", cables
used to bypass the meter box. At this time most residential meters were on the interior of
the houses. Therefore, it was easy to use jumpers relatively undetected. The solution for
TESCO was to develop their own meter box that could not be bypassed. The new meter
was installed on the exterior of the house so it could be easily read and inspected by
meter readers.
In 1936, Texas celebrated the state's centennial. Fair Park in Dallas was the main focus of
the activities. Not to be outdone, Fort Worth staged the Frontier Centennial. TESCO
installed all the extra electric lines, transformers and other facilities to power the
festivities. This included installing a power system capable of turning the stage at Casa
MaÃ±ana Theater.
During the pre-war years, many industries developed or expanded in Fort Worth
including Consolidated Aircraft Company, a bomber assembly company which later
became General Dynamics; Texas Steel Company and American Manufacturing
Company, both manufacturing war materials, and Burrus Mill and Elevator Company, a
grainery. TESCO provided increased power production for these industries. In 1940,
expenditures to improve or extend company properties were $910,800. In 1941,
$1,628,300 was spent, the largest annual expenditure for system construction since 1932.
The following year the company spent $850,00 for facilities to serve the new war
industries based mainly in Fort Worth.
The influence and reach of TESCO spanned North Central and West Texas. TESCO
served the Fort Worth metropolitan area as well as West Texas providing power to over
one hundred communities. Their service area encompassed Arlington/Fort Worth to the
east, Monahans/Odessa to the west, the Eastland area to the south and Wichita Falls to
the north. Just as with Fort Worth, TESCO was active in the economic development of
the towns in its service area. Under its Program for Economic Progress, TESCO trained
local leaders and helped to spearhead industrial recruitment for cities and towns. The
towns of Mansfield, Eastland and Ranger greatly benefited from this program and
TESCO's help (Gillmore 1976). Several of the lakes in the company's service area were
constructed as cooling stations and recreational facilities including Lakes Graham,
Edelman, J.B. Thomas, Colorado City, Champion Creek, Oak Creek, Wichita, Leon,
Como and Arlington. Many of these lakes were joint ventures between TESCO and the
communities. In 1945, TESCO combined with Texas Power and Light and Dallas Power
and Light to form the Texas Utilities Company.

The growth and expansion of Fort Worth Power and Light and the North Main Power
Plant played a major role in the economic development of the city of Fort Worth. The
city and the region needed reliable, economical power to grow and prosper and that was

Former site of Fort Worth Power and Light Plant.

History: The 1885 and 1889 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps show the North Side Street
Railroad Companyâs powerhouse and car house located on the site of the present TP&L
plant. Notes indicate that the car house was located 1 Â¼ miles northwest of the
Courthouse (Sanborn 1889 V.1, p.17). The 1893 map shows the powerhouse expanded
with three 350 HP dynamos and is about 225 feet to the Trinity River. The 1898 map
shows more detail of the car and powerhouse of the North Side Electric Street Railroad
Company. This map shows the artesian well and water tanks. The description for the car
house was as follows â[built] with an incline to the north to remove cars quickly in case
of fireâ (Sanborn Map 1898 v.1 p.29). Three dwellings were noted in this area in 1898
and might be residences used for the night watchmen at the powerhouse. Hermann Park
was shown at the northwest corner of Main and North Second and included a dancing
pavilion, a store and horse shed. Behind the park was the Armstrong Lumber Yard
(Figure 12. Sanborn Map 1898 v.1 p.29). Hermann Park was listed in the 1916 City
Directory at the northwest corner of Main and West Second Streets. In the 1918 City
Directory, the store at Hermann Park was called the Fredrick Runge Saloon. On the east
side of North Main at North Second East (this is at the foot of the viaduct) there were 10
of 13 residences occupied (City Directory 1918 Street Index).

The 1911 Sanborn Map shows the Fort Worth Granite and Marble Works on the
southwest corner of North Second Street West and N. Main Street. Directly across the
street was the Fort Worth Machine and Foundry Company. The Fort Worth Power and
Light Plant was constructed in1911 just south of Hermann Park. By 1914, the City
Directory listed Fort Worth Marble and Granite on N. Main between 5th and 6th streets
(City Directory 1914 Street Index). On the east side of North Main on North Second East
(this is at the foot of the viaduct) there were 13 residences, 10 were occupied (City
Directory 1918 Street Index). Humble Oil and Refining shows up in the 1920 City
Directory listed at 205-215 North 4th West (City Directory 1920 Street Index). This same
year, there were 12 residences along North Second East from N. Main Street to N.
Commerce. On North Third East there were three residences (City Directory 1920 Street
Index). Hermann Park was still listed in the 1920 City Directory and the grocery located
at the corner of the site at 201 N. Main was run by N.B. Marbut. By 1926, Hermann Park
was no longer extant. However, Humble Refining was still listed on the southwest corner
between West 2nd and West 3rd on Houston Street, just west of N. Main. On N. 2nd there
were six residences and two offices (City Directory 1926 Street Index). The 1930, 1935
and 1943City Directories shows Humble Oil Refining. The 1935 City Directory shows 10
residences between N. Main and N. Commerce on North 2nd East. By 1943, there were
only three residences listed in the City Directory (City Directory 1943 Street Index).

B. The Bluff Area
The area surrounding the courthouse and located to the east of the early fort developed as
a mix of commercial and residential. In many situations, boarding houses and âfurnished
roomsâ were located on the second floor of many commercial businesses. The blocks to
the east of the courthouse on E. Bluff and E. Belknap were somewhat more residential in
nature. E. Bluff remained residential until the summer of 2003 when several of the homes
were demolished for development. Many of the houses dated to between 1880 and 1915.
This was, along with the Samuels Avenue area, the first residential neighborhood in Fort
Worth. The block descriptions listed below chronicle the growth and development of the
area.

Block Descriptions
Early city directories (1877 and 1878-79) often do not give street numbers for properties
and do not list the reverse street directory. Addresses are noted as âJ.C. Scott, Attorney,
resident East Belknapâ (City Directory 1877 p. 71). Other businesses or residents are
noted with a street number such as âR.F. Tackaberry, resident 32 E. Weatherfordâ (City
Directory 1877 p.73). Unfortunately, it is difficult to know exactly where 32 E.
Weatherford was located, as it was not noted with cross streets. Street numbers changed
by the time the first Sanborn Map was issued in 1885. When possible, we have tried to
identify the location of early houses and businesses. The streets Commerce (Rusk),
Calhoun, Jones, Grove and Pecan are sometimes noted on the maps as N. Calhoun, N.
Commerce, etc.

Physical description: This block is bounded by East Belknap Street on the north, North
Commerce (Rusk) Street on the west, Calhoun Street on the east and East Weatherford
Street on the south.
History: The 1878-79 City Directory noted that Robert Barnes of Williams Brothers and
Barnes lived on the west side of Calhoun between Bluff and Belknap (City Directory
1878-79 p. 34). The 1885 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map shows a blacksmith shop at the
southwest corner of N. Rusk and Weatherford. On the west side of the block going north
on Rusk were frame buildings including the Illinois Home (102-106 N. Rusk). This block
included a laundry, bakery, soap factory and four houses. Facing Calhoun was a
âtenementâ. The 1889 Sanborn shows the blacksmith shop in the same location, however
the Illinois Home was replaced by the Tremont Hotel, a three-story frame structure with a
dining room, kitchen and a hen house located at the rear. There were two other structures
described as sleeping rooms and another dwelling, most probably a boarding house. The
soap factory was later replaced by a commercial building. Two houses and the tenement
facing Calhoun completed the block.
The blacksmith shop at 100 N. Rusk still exists on the 1898 Sanborn Map as does the
Tremont Hotel. The boarding house and tenement are gone, replaced by a house. There
were two other houses located on the block. By 1911, Rusk Street has changed to
Commerce Street and the block number has changed to Block 4. There is now an iron and
junkyard at the previous location of the blacksmith shop (100 N. Rusk/Commerce) but
there is a new location for the blacksmith at 104 N. Commerce. The blacksmith shop was
run by Edward Carr. The Tremont Hotel was replaced by a two story brick building
housing Fort Worth Storage and Furniture (108 N. Commerce) (City Directory 1911). A
tin shop, Lewis Sheet Metal Works, was next door. Keathly Brothers Grocery was at 114
N. Commerce with the owner living upstairs over the shop. On East Belknap, at 212, was
a large boarding house that replaced an earlier dwelling. The Central Church of Christ
was built at 211 E. Weatherford.
By 1926, this block was mainly commercial. The blacksmith has gone, replaced by Texas
Battery and Starter, a battery service and gas station. The filling station exhibits the
typical placement at an angle so customers can drive through. Other buildings on the
block were related to auto repair including Clarence Kraft Motor Company. The Central
Church of Christ, located at 209-211 E. Weatherford vacated its building and the building
became home to the North Texas Traction Company terminal and car barns. By 1930,
this building is gone. The 1930 City Directory shows the Continental Bakery at 202 E.
Belknap with the Howard Hotel located upstairs.
The 1910 Sanborn Map, corrected to 1951, does not show any buildings on the east half
of the block. The 1949 Sanborn Map, corrected to 1970, indicates the same with
buildings located on the west half of the block.

been completely altered but the rear of the building shows brick possibly from the 1940s
or 1950s.

2. Block 11 (Also known as Block 5)
Physical description: This block is bounded by East Belknap Street on the north, Calhoun
Street on the west, the Jones Street on the east, and East Weatherford Street on the south.
History: Only the eastern part of this block appears on the 1885 Sanborn Map. There
were two houses on the southwest corner, two tenements on the west side (Calhoun), and
two tenements on the north side (E. Belknap). There was a meat store at the northwest
corner of Belknap and Calhoun. By 1889, the entire block is shown on the 1889 Sanborn
Map. All the structures were wood frame. At the northwest corner of East Belknap and
Calhoun, along East Belknap there were two houses. On the Calhoun block face there
were two structures, one is listed as a âNegro tenementâ. There were five houses, all one
story, on East Weatherford.

Block 11 also known earlier as Block 5.

The 1893 Sanborn Map shows a two story wood structure on E. Belknap that was a
boarding house, a separate house and a two story wood âproduceâ building that probably
had living quarters upstairs. Also, there is a wood yard. At 102-104 Calhoun was the
âNegro tenementâ and along E. Weatherford, there were five wood houses. These
structures are shown on the 1898 Sanborn Map as well. The âNegro tenementâ at 102104 Calhoun is now gone. Along E. Belknap, there were three houses and a two story
wood structure that housed the office of the wood and coal yard. The wood and coal yard
later had a shed and a wood sawing and splitting area.

By 1911 there were two boarding houses along the E. Belknap block face and in place of
the wood yard a house was built. Along the N. Jones Block face there were two
residences. The E. Weatherford block face had five residential structures all without
buildings; some may have been garage apartments. There was not much change on this
block between 1911 and 1926. John Krull and his wife lived at 300 E. Belknap and his
grocery store was located at 107 N. Calhoun, just across the street from his house
location (City Directory 1925 Street Index). The block appears predominately residential.
The 1910 corrected to 1951 Sanborn Map shows a parking lot at the northwest quarter of
the block (N. Calhoun and E. Belknap). There was a gas station, Price Filling Station, at
the corner of E. Belknap and N. Jones (312 E. Belknap) (City Directory 1940 Street
Index). On the E. Weatherford block face, the street appears mainly residential. The 1949
corrected to 1971 Sanborn Map indicates a furniture store at 304 E. Belknap that was
constructed in 1953 where the parking lot was located. The houses that face E.
Weatherford still appear on the map.
Current Conditions:
There is one extant structure, Penderyâs located at 304 E. Belknap. The rest of the block
is surface parking.

Physical description: This block is bounded by East Belknap Street on the north, North
Grove Street on the east, East Weatherford Street on the south and North Jones Street on
the west.
History: The 1885 Sanborn Map does not exists for this block. Noted on the Index Map
were three frame dwellings on E. Belknap and two frame businesses. The 1889 Sanborn
Map indicates a large two story dwelling at 400 E. Belknap (corner of Jones). Next to this
was a house that has a store located in it. Next, is a small out building and another house
at 410 E. Belknap. On the E. Weatherford block face there was a two story dwelling, a
one story dwelling facing N. Jones and a shotgun house with two small structures on N.
Grove. There is no change in this block on the 1893 Sanborn Map.
The house at 400 E. Belknap still exists on the 1898 Sanborn Map. Next, the one story
house has been replaced with a two story house, possibly a boarding house, and two more
residential structures with out buildings. There were two large frame houses on the E.
Weatherford block face.
In 1910, the Walter A. Huffman Public School was constructed at 410 E. Belknap, filling
the entire block (Sanborn Map 1911). The school was a two story brick building with a
basement, steam heat, electric lights and gas or coal for fuel. By 1930, the building was
used as the Administration Building for Fort Worth Independent School District (City
Directory 1930 Street Index). On the 1949 (corrected to 1971) Sanborn Map, the building
was called the Childrenâs Building. It was torn down approximately 20 years ago.
Current Conditions:
This block contains one recently built structure, Texas Capital Bank at 400 E, Belknap.
No other structures remain.

Physical description: This block is bounded by East Belknap Street on the north, North
Pecan Street on the east, East Weatherford Street on the south and North Grove Street on
the west.
History: The 1885 Sanborn Map does not include this block as it was further east, near
the edge of the city. The 1889 Sanborn Map shows a sparsely populated block with a
wood structure, possibly a store, at the northwest corner of E. Belknap and N. Jones and a
house facing on E. Belknap, addressed as 514 E. Belknap. There was a windmill and
storage tank on the property line that divided the north and south halves of the block.
This was probably for the large boarding house located at 503 E. Weatherford, the corner
of E. Weatherford and N. Grove. There were two other residential structures on this block
face. The 1893 map shows the same structures. There was a two story frame house at 502
E. Belknap where the wood structure was located. There was a one story house next door.
The tank and windmill still existed with the large boarding house at 503 E. Weatherford.
There were two other dwelling structures that finished out the E. Weatherford block face.
In 1911, there were four houses along the E. Belknap block face with out buildings and
rear apartments. Fred Boulware, general manager of the Texas Printing Company, lived
at 500 E. Belknap (located on the map as 502 E. Belknap) (City Directory 1911 Street
Index). Arthur Thomas, conductor for the CRI & G Railroad, lived at 504 E. Belknap
(508 E. Belknap on the map). The boarding house is still located at 503 E. Weatherford.
On the N. Pecan block face, at 107 N. Pecan, Rev. Clovis Chappell resided (City
Directory 1911 Street Index). The 1926 Sanborn Map is the same as the 1911 Map.
The 1910 corrected to 1951 Sanborn Map shows 500 E. Belknap as a different building,
constructed after 1911. It is now a two story apartment building with garage apartments
located in the rear. The house at 504/508 E. Belknap was brick faced. There is now an
apartment building at 514 E. Belknap. The house at 107 N. Pecan has gone. The house at
501 E. Weatherford was noted as a one story brick house with a two story garage
apartment. Next to this was 507 E. Weatherford, a one story house with a garage. At 511
E. Weatherford there is a two story stucco building with four apartments that were built
between 1930 and 1935 that still exist. The dwelling at the corner of E. Weatherford and
N. Pecan (513/515 E. Weatherford) is still there. The 1949 corrected to 1970 Sanborn
Map shows the apartments at 500 E. Belknap still there as is 504, but 510 is gone, 514
was listed as a dwelling in 1940.
Current Conditions:
This is the most intact extant block in the project area with several structures built
between 1905 and 1946.

5. Block 1 (Also known as Block 7)

Figure 38.

Block 1 also known as Block 7.

Physical description: This block is bounded by East Bluff Street on the north, North
Calhoun Street on the east, East Belknap Street on the south and North Commerce (Rusk)
Street on the west.
History: The 1885 Sanborn Map shows a store at 201 E. Belknap where a blacksmith
worked. The building was brick and had a boiler. Next door at 203 E. Belknap was
another commercial brick building. Also, the block face also had a house at 205 and a
boarding house at 207. At 209 and 211 there were frame two story buildings, each might
have had a store on the first floor with housing upstairs. Two houses faced Calhoun and
there were two houses on E. Bluff. In 1889, the blacksmith was still there and a
wheelwright had opened a business at 203 E. Belknap. There were dwellings still at 205
and 207 E. Belknap. At 209-211 E. Belknap was a two story frame boarding house with a
kitchen located at the rear. E. Bluff had the same buildings as in 1885.
By 1893, there were more commercial uses on the block. The Sanborn Map of that year
shows a feed store at 201 E. Belknap and a blacksmith at 203. Next door at 205 E.
Belknap was now a small frame commercial building that sold produce. The boarding
house is still located at 209/211 E. Belknap. Along E. Bluff there were smaller frame
buildings that may be stores.
In 1898, the block had a two story building at 201 E. Belknap that was iron clad in the
back. The blacksmith is still at 203 E. Belknap. There was still a store at 205 and a
________________________________________________________________________

46

blacksmith next door at 207. Next to that, a new building was built at 209 that housed a
store and 211 was a two story building. The block face on E. Bluff remained the same.
By 1911, the Sanborn Map shows a new building at 201 E. Belknap and Charles L.
Moore as the blacksmith at this location (City Directory 1911 Street Index). Next door at
205-207 E. Belknap there were several businesses including the Mexican Chili Supply at
207, William E. Pipes, a barber; Simmons and Elliott Saloon and housing upstairs. L.
Roy Ellis was the grocer at 209 E. Belknap, a wood frame two story building. There was
a boarding house at 211 E. Belknap. On the E. Bluff block face there was a boarding
house. At 208 N. Commerce, there was one house occupied by an African American
(City Directory 1911 Street Index).
The 1926 Sanborn Map indicated Stanley Hamlett Auto Tops at 201 E. Belknap (City
Directory 1920 Street Index). Upstairs was the Belknap Hotel and in 1925 the Union
Hotel (City Directory 1925 Street Index). Next door was a two story building with stairs
off the back that were addressed as 203, 205 and 207 with the following businesses:
Stanley Hamlett, Renfro Grocery and Mexican Chili Supply and Belknap Chili Parlor.
Upstairs were two apartments. At 209 was a two story building occupied by DeArment
Grocery. At 204 E. Bluff there was a blacksmith. A rooming house was located at 210 E.
Bluff. Around the corner on N. Commerce, 208-214 appeared to tie into 201 E. Belknap.
In this space was an auto repair shop. By 1926, local retailers the Leonard Brothers
opened their showroom at 203 E. Belknap replacing Stanley Hamlett. By 1930, the
blacksmith at 204 E. Bluff is gone, his services probably not needed any more. By 1940,
the east end of the block was occupied by Brown Service Station (City Directory 1940
Street Index). At this time 203 E. Belknap was West Texas Bag Company and 205 was
Hyman Lichtman shoe repair and barber. The Mexican Chili Supply, started in 1870 by
Mr. Pendery, is still located at 207 E. Belknap (City Directory 1940 Street Index).

Current Conditions:
There are three extant buildings on this block. The building at 201-203 E. Belknap dates
from the 1920s, the building at 205-207 dates from 1910. The building at 201-203 E.
Belknap has been altered, but 205-207 is intact. The other property at 215 E. Belknap, a
small auto repair building, was built in 1937.

Physical description: This block is bounded by East Bluff Street on the north, North
Jones Street on the east, East Belknap Street on the south and North Calhoun Street on
the west.
History: The 1885 Sanborn Map shows seven dwellings with several out buildings. There
were only two buildings with street numbers at this time, 809 and 811 E. Belknap, and
the other houses are denoted by letters X, W, V on E. Belknap and Y, Z, AA on E. Bluff.
By the time of the next map, 1889, the lots are now divided and there are numbers on the
dwellings. The block was mostly residential. There was a boarding house at 301 E.
Belknap, 307 was noted as a tenement house that extended back to a dwelling on E.
Bluff. There were two other houses on E. Belknap at 309 and 311. The structure at 315 E.
Belknap was residential but may be a boarding house. Another house was located at 214
N. Calhoun at the corner of E. Bluff.
The 1893 and 1898 Sanborn Maps show no appreciable change. By 1911, the boarding
house at 301 E. Belknap has been replaced by a single-family residence occupied by
African Americans (City Directory 1911 Street Index). The houses at 307 and 309 remain
the same as does 315. The house at 311 E. Belknap may be the same with a rear addition.
The house addressed earlier as 310 E. Bluff is now addressed as 317 Â½ E. Belknap. The
house at 214 N. Calhoun was new and larger with two out buildings. By 1920, the City
Directory Street Index shows that the block is becoming commercial. At 301 E. Belknap
was the Square Grocery however the rest of the block remained residential. The house at
214 N. Calhoun became a boarding house with an out building occupied by an African
American (City Directory 1920 Street Index).
The 1926 Sanborn Map shows the Square Grocery building gone from 301 E. Belknap.
There were dwellings at 305 and 307 E. Belknap. There is a new building at 309-311 E.
Belknap built in 1924. It was a two story brick building that extended the depth of the lot
and was occupied by Wood and Bell. The 1930 City Directory had the Square Grocery
relocating a few doors down to 307 E. Belknap. The building next door, 309/311 later
housed Acme Baggage and Transfer (City Directory 1930 Street Index). The dwellings
on the block became boarding houses. The 1910 corrected to 1951 Sanborn Map has 303
and 305 as a different building occupied by OâNeal Tire Distributor and later by a
grocery warehouse (City Directory 1935 and 1940 Street Index). The Square Grocery
remained in the 307 E. Belknap location from 1930 to 1940 (City Directory 1930, 1935,
1940 Street Index). The building at 309/311 remained the same, although it was vacant
off and on (City Directory 1930, 1935 and 1940). The 1949 Sanborn Map corrected to
1971 shows 303, 313 and 315 E. Belknap as demolished. The building at 307 was torn
down and replaced with a one story building.
Current Conditions:
There are no extant buildings in this block and it is now used as a parking lot.

the west. The configuration of this block was slightly different when the Novelty Mills
and Grain Warehouse was located to the north of this block.
History: The 1885 Sanborn Map shows the Concho Wagon yard on the western half of
this block with a house located directly east of the wagon yard. The Concho Wagon Yard
was owned by Barnes and Holder. Jim M. Barnes lived at 411 E. Belknap as did Charles
A. Holder, this house was located at the Wagon Yard (1902-03 City Directory). Directly
north of the defined block was a driveway area with a grain warehouse for the Novelty
Roller Mills. Also, there was a small house next to the warehouse. The 1877 City
Directory notes that David Boaz lived on Bluff at the Novelty Roller Mills. The Concho
Wagon Yard is still prominent on the 1889 Sanborn Map with the Mark Evans Grain
Elevator directly to the north. This may be a newer grain Elevator than the one on the
1885 map. The configuration and siting have changed. The house where the owners of
the wagon yard lived is still there.

Figure 45.

1885 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map showing Concho Wagon Yard
and Novelty Roller Mills.

The 1893 Sanborn Map shows the buildings at the wagon yard addressed as well as their
uses. The grocery was an iron-clad building located at 401 E. Belknap. Next to it, at 403,
was a store. The shed next to this had the numbers 405, 407 and 409 E. Belknap. The
feed store was 411 E. Belknap and the house was 413. The sheds facing E. Bluff were
listed with the following addresses: 409 Â½ and 413 Â½. These sheds were one story and
may have housed horses and equipment. The grain elevator is now vacant as is the mill.
The 1898 Sanborn Map shows the same building configuration as the 1893 Map.
By 1911 the block changed to its configuration. The wagon yard (still called Concho
Wagon Yard) still occupied its original site although the buildings have a somewhat

different configuration. The two stores at the corner, 401 and 403 E. Belknap are still
iron-clad two story structures. Farmers and Merchants Produce remains at 401. Where
405, 407, 409 once stood became a wagon shed with no address. Next to this was number
411, a two story structure with sleeping rooms. The larger house, now addressed as 415417 (413), later served as a boarding house (City Directory 1911 Street Index). On the
north side of the block, facing E. Bluff, where there had been a driveway for the Novelty
Roller Mills and the Grain Elevator, there are now four houses. One of these, 404 E.
Bluff, was a boarding house. Mark Evans, who owned the mill lived at 408 E. Bluff. The
mill and grain elevator were torn down. In 1914, the wagon yard may have changed
names to the Van Haber Wagon Yard (City Directory 1914 Street Index). The 1920 City
Directory shows the Concho Wagon Yard at 411 E. Belknap. There are four houses listed
on E. Bluff (City Directory 1920 Street Index).
The 1925 City Directory still has the Concho Wagon Yard listed and the houses are still
the same on the E. Bluff block face (City Directory 1925 Street Index). The 1926
Sanborn Map shows the wagon yard with a larger two story store at 401-403 E. Belknap.
The smaller store at 411 and the house at 415 (was 415/417, also 413) are both still the
same. The wagon yard is in the 1930 City Directory but by 1935, it has been replaced by
Hewett Auto Wrecking and A&B Trading Post (City Directory 1930, 1935 Street Index).
The house next door at 415 E. Belknap is vacant. The 1910 corrected to 1951 Sanborn
Map shows the auto wrecking business and a filling station. All of the wagon yard
buildings are gone. The house (415) is still extant but used for apartments. The four
houses on the E. Bluff block face are still there. The 1949 corrected to 1971 Sanborn Map
shows only the filling station on the southwest corner of E. Belknap and N. Jones, the
wrecking yard is gone. The four houses on E. Bluff were still there and so is the house at
415 (now apartments).
Current Conditions:
The site of the Concho Wagon Yard has been replaced by a parking lot. There is one
other extant house at 414 (410) E. Bluff that dates back to around 1910. The north side of
this block is approximately where the grain elevator was located.

The 1885 Sanborn Map shows only the west half of the block with a shed like building
facing Grove and a house facing E. Belknap. The 1889 Sanborn Map has a more
complete block map showing the recent development on the east edge of town. The
structures are addressed by letters and not numbers. The house on E. Belknap that was on
the 1885 Map is still there with a two story structure on the same lot facing on to N.
Grove. There is another house just east on Belknap with two out buildings. On the north
half of the block is a house facing E. Bluff that has two sheds. This may be a boarding
house due to its size. The 1893 Sanborn Map has the buildings numbered. The house on
the southwest corner of E. Belknap and N. Grove is numbered as 505 and the next house
is 509. The shed like buildings on N. Grove are 207, 209, 213. The house on E. Bluff is
addressed as 213 N. Pecan. The 1898 Map shows the same building configuration. The
1911 Sanborn Map shows a house next to 505 addressed as 501 E. Belknap and 509 is
still there. The Pendery family of Mexican Chili Supply lived at 501 (City Directory 1911
Street Index). There is a house addressed at 211 N. Pecan and the house at 213 N. Pecan
is still there. The large house at 213 N. Pecan is a boarding house (City Directory 1911
Street Index). The shed like structure previously addressed as 213 N. Grove is now a two
story structure.
The 1926 Sanborn Map shows the same houses on E. Belknap, now each has a garage in
back. The shed (213 N. Grove) is gone. The boarding house at 213 N. Pecan is still there
as the Womenâs Co-operative Home (City Directory 1925 Street Index). The 1910
corrected to 1951 shows an apartment building at 501 E. Belknap, a different building
with a store at 505-507. There are apartments at 509, although this may still be the earlier
building. There is a restaurant, the Fern Garden CafÃ©, at 511 E. Belknap (City Directory
1930 and 1935 Street Index). The house at 211 N. Pecan is there but not 213 N. Pecan.
The house at 213 N. Pecan was demolished between 1935 and 1940 (City Directory
1930, 1935 and 1940 Street Index). The rest of the E. Bluff block face has been
demolished. The 1949 corrected to 1971 Sanborn Map shows only the restaurant building
at 511 E. Belknap and a small structure for used car sales at 509.
Current Conditions:
The only extant building is the Leonard Brothers Farm Store at 501 E. Belknap. The rest
of the block is paved and used for parking.

Physical description: This is the area on the north side of Bluff Street from North Main
Street to North Pecan.
History: The 1885 Sanborn Map shows several structures along E. Bluff. These structures
were addressed with letters and not numbers. On E. Bluff at N. Commerce (then Rusk)
there is a two story boarding house lettered âAâ on the map. Next to it is âBâ, a two and a
half story dwelling, âCâ is a vacant one story house set below the bluff, âDâ is another
vacant house, maybe a shotgun and âEâ is a more substantial two story house. At E. Bluff
and N. Calhoun, there are three structures: âFâ, a small one story house; âGâ a two story
house with a porch extending out over the Bluff and âHâ another one story house.
Between N. Calhoun and N. Jones on the north side of E. Bluff there are four frame
houses. Just east on N. Jones on the north side of E. Bluff is the Novelty Roller Mills.
The Novelty Roller Mill was at this location approximately 20 years. It is listed in the
1877 and 1878-79 City Directories (City Directory 1877 p.67; 1878-79 p.98). The
location is listed as the north side of Bluff between Jones and Grove and gives the
address as 93-95 Bluff. The 1877 City Directory lists W.E. Patterson as âengineer
Novelty Millsâ and G. W. Patterson as âteamster Novelty Millsâ (City Directory 1877
p.69). The 1878-79 City Directory lists Wamsley and Schorn as the managers of the mill
(City Directory 1878-79 p.125). The 1885 Sanborn Map notes that the power is steam,
that there is a night watchman and fire buckets on each floor. It also notes that the fuel is
Coal and the light is from oil lamps. The mill is described as having 70 sets of rolls and
flour packers, 78 bolting reels, five Smith purifiers, two Barnard and Ler separators,
seven magnetic wire extractors, seven California smutters at 500 revolutions, seven
Victor Double Baush at 500 revolutions and seven Kirk Corckle machines (Sanborn Fire
Insurance Maps, 1885,Volume 1, p.12). Just south of the mill and north of block 13 was a
grain warehouse. This parcel later became part of block 13. The mill is also on the 1889
map as the Mark Evans Novelty Roller Mill although the grain warehouse is now a grain
elevator. The grain elevator is a different structure from the 1885 grain warehouse. The
elevator is 22 feet tall at the eaves and 44 feet tall at the ridge line and is made of
corrugated iron (Sanborn Fire Insurance Map 1889 volume 1, p.4). The 1893 and 1898
Sanborn Maps shows the mill as vacant. The mill is not listed in the 1902 City Directory.
By the 1911 Sanborn Map, the mill has been demolished and replaced by houses.
However, Mark Evans lives across the street at 408 E. Bluff where the grain elevator
used to sit (City Directory 1911 Street Index).
On the 1885 Sanborn Map, from the mill east to a little past Grove, there are three
dwellings with some small out buildings. This is as far as the map extends.

1885 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map showing Novelty Roller Mills.

The 1889 Sanborn Map shows Main Street going north across the Trinity. Between Main
Street and N. Rusk on E. Bluff are three houses with no addresses. From N. Rusk to the
mill there are 11 structures, some are still addressed with letters but some have numbers.
Several of the structures extend to the edge of the bluff and have porches that extend over
the bluff. Some have stairs that obviously extend down the bluff. From the mill east past
N. Grove there are three houses one is addressed as C, then 419, 503 and across the alley
facing Bluff is a log structure.
By 1893, there have been some changes on the street. The Sanborn Map for that year
shows 13 houses along Bluff to the mill. The houses at addresses 213, 215, 301 and 305
(two houses) are listed as tenements. These are smaller one story frame structures. There
is a store at 307 E. Bluff, in between the houses. The house at 319 E. Bluff is listed as 30
feet from the mill. The houses on the east side of the mill remain the same with the
addition of two more houses; the log structure is listed at 513 E. Bluff.
The 1898 Sanborn Map shows no change except additions to a couple of the structures
for the houses on the west side of the mill. As stated before, the mill is now vacant. On
the east side of the mill are six houses; the log house at 513 has been replaced with a
larger one story house.

The 1911 Sanborn Map shows several changes to the street including some commercial
uses. There is a blacksmith located at 201 E. Bluff; it is listed as St. Clair Blacksmith in
the 1911 City Directory. The city directory also shows 203 E. Bluff as a boarding house
and 215 as used residence and office for James Burke, medical manufacturer. At 303 E.
Bluff is James Irvinâs grocery store then there are five residences (City Directory 1911
Street Index). The land where the mill was located is vacant. On the east side of the mill
site are three houses, two which were on the previous map and one new house. There is
an undertakerâs stable behind the house at 507 and the address is listed as 507 Â½ E. Bluff.
The large house at 515 E. Bluff at Pecan is no longer there. In 1914, the blacksmith at
201 E. Bluff is King Blacksmith. There are five houses to finish out the 200 block. Mrs.
Irvin now runs the grocery at 303 E. Bluff. There are five residences from 303 E. Bluff to
the site of the mill and five residences on the east side of the mill site to Pecan (City
Directory 1914 Street Index).

Stable.
On the 1926 Sanborn Fire Insurance map, there are more commercial structures along E.
Bluff. Directly behind the Courthouse is an auto painting shop at 105 E. Bluff with a
hotel, the Bluff Street Hotel, next to going east on Bluff. There is a store at 201 E. Bluff
followed by six houses. There is a poultry business at 305-307 run by R.H. Brewer. This
structure replaces some of the houses that were here previously (City Directory 1925
Street Index). The mill site still has not been redeveloped. East of the mill site, 503 and
505 E. Bluff are different structures from those on the 1911 map, although they are still
dwellings. The house at 507 E. Bluff that had the undertakerâs stable behind it has also
been replaced. The undertakerâs stable is an auto paint shop, Central Auto Paint and Top
Shop (City Directory 1925 Street Index). Another house has replaced the previous one at
515 E. Bluff but it is addressed as 517 and is located at a different location on the lot.
The 1910 corrected to 1951 Sanborn Map shows the buildings from Main to Commerce
as demolished and replaced by used car sales. The block face has become increasingly
commercial. The house at 205 E. Bluff is still there but the houses at 211 and 213 have
been replaced by an auto repair shop addressed 211 E. Bluff. The poultry business at 305
has three stores surrounding it including Millerâs Beer Tavern at 311 E. Bluff and a
restaurant at 315 E. Bluff and a pillow factory on the Sanborn Maps. Apartments were
located at 321 E. Bluff. The 400 block has 401 and 419. This is includes the former site
of the mill. It looks as if there was no redevelopment of this site after the mill was
demolished. The Central Auto Paint Shop is still at 507 E. Bluff in 1940 (City Directory
1940 Street Index).

10. Block 2 and 3 (Also known as Old Block 4A 1898)

Figure 57.

Block 2 also known as Old Block 4A 1898.

Physical description: This block is located directly behind (north side) the courthouse. It
is bounded by Bluff Street on the north, Commerce Street (Rusk) on the east, Belknap
Street on the south, and Houston Street on the west.
History: On the 1885 Sanborn Map, this block has the County Jail, a two story bathhouse
with three water tanks and a boiler for heating water. A house was next door to this and
may have been the proprietorâs home. Facing N. Rusk was the Fort Worth Marble Works
with a two story structure and stone cutting building behind. The County Jail was still
located here in 1889 with the Artesian Bathhouse with four water tanks, elevation seven
feet and a heater for boiling water. The Bounty Hotel and Wareâs Boarding House was
located just to the east of the bathhouse. Fort Worth Marble Works is still in the same
place. By 1893, the Natatorium Steam Laundry located at 103 E. Belknap, the site of the
Artesian Bathhouse, was open. Wareâs Boarding House was located at 105 E. Belknap.
The Marble works is still there at 113 E. Belknap with a two story office. On the 1898
Sanborn Map is the new three-story jail. The Fort Worth Marble Works had moved and
been replaced by a house addressed at 205 N. Rusk. Fort Worth Monumental was located
at 111 E. Belknap and it was located there until 1925 (City Directory 1911 Street Index
and 1911 and 1926 Sanborn Insurance Maps). The Natatorium Steam Laundry was still
located at 101-105 E. Belknap however the building was new. It was a two story brick
structure with a concrete floor, the office and laundry on the first floor and the ironing on
the second floor. There were three water tanks, the heat was steam, the lights were
electric and the fuel was coal. The laundry remained at this location until about 1930. By

1926 the Sanborn Map shows a towel supply at 111 E. Belknap with an auto repair
business behind it. At 113 E. Belknap United Advertising Corporation of Texas is there
and Jack Dempsey Tire Company is at 115 E. Belknap. The 1930 City Directory lists 113
and 115 as in the same building. It is the Art Kleeburg Service Station with a boarding
house upstairs. The 1935 City Directory lists the Courthouse Brake and Axel Garage at
11 E. Belknap and 113-115 is the Lovelady Grocery and the Tucker Tire Company. The
1940 City Directory still lists the Courthouse Brake and Axel Garage but the Salvation
Army Industrial Store is at 113-115 E. Belknap. The 1910 corrected to 1951 Sanborn
Map shows the park.

RECORDS REVIEW

The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) which is available through the Texas
Historical Commission contains archaeological records on file at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory at The University of Texas in Austin. A check of TASA revealed
that no archaeological sites are recorded on the property although it is recognized that
historic standing structures are present. Likewise, the records of the Historic Preservation
Council for Tarrant County (1991) were reviewed and showed the presence of potentially
significant historic structures. This information is contained in this report and was
prepared by Cornerstone Heritage Preservation Services (2005).
The 1889 and 1926/27 Sanborn Insurance maps were
utilized to determine if any basements or subsurface
rooms exist in the 8 city blocks that are within the
proposed site location. The Sanborn map key (Figure
61) indicates a basement by a small B next to the
number of stories for a particular structure. After
close examination of Blocks 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
and 16 on the 1889 map (Figure 62) it was
determined that the only basements were in two
structures along the bluff. On the 1926/27 Sanborn
map (Figure 63) the two structures appear to either
not exist or have been modified as they donât have
basements. There is only one structure that has a
basement located along the bluff parallel to city block
3 which is indicated as city block 14 on the 1889 Figure 61.
A portion of the
map. The basements located along the bluff were Sanborn Insurance map key.
likely split level structures because they only appear
on the bluff and nowhere else. As a result further subsurface testing of the city blocks is
unwarranted because all historic maps indicate that there are no subsurface features.

BLUFF TESTING
A pedestrian survey of both parts of the bluff area (Figure 64) was carried out and no
artifactual evidence of prehistoric occupation was found. Likewise, no conclusive
evidence of historic occupation predating 1950 was observed other than the fact that
street names and numbers are present in the curbs along Bluff Street (Figure 65). These
features were apparently added to the curbs during the Great Depression (Historic
Preservation Council for Tarrant County, Texas 1991:131). Shovel testing and backhoe
trenching were conducted in the unpaved areas situated between Bluff Street and the
present edge of the bluff. The locations of the shovel test pits and trenches are shown on
Figure 67 and the shovel tests are itemized in Table 1.

Figure 64.

Proposed Downtown Campus site shown on a section of the Haltom City,
TX 7.5' USGS map.

Shovel testing revealed that rubble fill is present immediately below the present ground
surface in the strip grassy areas between Bluff Street and the bluff edge (Figure 66). In
some places, fill was deeper than shovel tests normally reach, ie 80 cm, but limestone
bedrock was encountered in more than half of the test pits at depths ranging from 38 to
130 cm. Apparently undisturbed soil resting on the bedrock was discovered in STs 4 and
5 but no evidence of undisturbed prehistoric or historic occupation was found in these

undisturbed sediments. The only feature on the bluff surface was a concrete slab (Figure
67) situated between STs 16 and Trench 1 in the area of the Novelty Roller Mills.
Unfortunately, no foundation shown on the maps of the Novelty Roller Mills complex
corresponds to the concrete slab location.
A variety of artifacts were noted in the shovel tests but were not collected due to their
lack of time sensitivity. These include commercial bricks, asphalt, plain white ceramics,
limestone, slate, rusty metal, bottle and window glass. Shovel test 16 yielded a small
glass jar and a brass fence sign. The jar base has the makers mark âHAâ with a number 2
below which stands for Hazel Atlas and was used between 1920 and 1964 (Toulouse
1972: 239). Square in shape with rounded edges, the jar stands 2 11/16â high and has two
ribbed sides. The raised letters on the 1 9/16â x 7 Â¼â brass sign read âTEXAS ANCHOR
FENCE CO., FORT WORTH, TEXAS.â
Texas Anchor Fence Co. Inc. opened in Fort Worth Texas between the years of 19011902. According to the remaining preserved City Directories, located in the Tarrant
County Archives, Civil Courts Bldg., the company opened its doors on the NW corner of
East Daggett Ave. and Park. The following year, 1902-1903, the City Directory places
the company at 1607-1609 Houston Street (Morrison and Fourmy 1903). The archives do
not have a complete set of City Directories; consequently, the next mention of this
company was in a book donated to the archives which list a new office and factory for
Texas Anchor Fence Co. Inc. at 601-603 Throckmorton. This photo is dated 1907 (Owen
1907). The building was part of a group called the W. J. Boaz Buildings. This building
currently houses, among other businesses, The Pour House, a bar and restaurant.
In the 1909-1910 City Directory a complete listing of the main employees and products
of the company was printed (Morrison and Fourmy 1910). The company executive
officers were: J.W. Spencer, president; Wm J. Boaz, vice-president; B.H. Martin,
secretary; Ben O. Smith; treasurer; D.F. Murphy, assistant treasurer; J. F. Shelton,
general manager. The company manufactured farm, stock and lawn fencing, wire work,
bank and office fixtures. In the 1916 and 1918 City Directories Texas Anchor Fence Co.
Inc. is located at 1308 Front Street, now named East Lancaster, and has new company
officers except two. Ben O. Smith remains as treasurer and B.H. Martin continues as
secretary. The other officers were: T.B. Van Tuyl, president and G.W. Polk, vicepresident.
By 1920 the name, Texas Anchor Fence Company, Inc. was gone. Names such as Texas
Cyclone Fence and Southern Manufacturing Co. replaced it. Therefore it appears that the
Texas Anchor Fence Company existed in Fort Worth approximately 18-20 years and
either the business was closed or bought out and renamed.

Tiles used to mark 400 E. Bluff. View is to the south.

Seven backhoe trenches were excavated in the strip of exposed land north of Bluff Street.
No trenches were excavated in the paved parking areas and this is why some areas along
Bluff Street were not tested. The same is true for the blocks south of Bluff Street which
are either paved or are covered by standing structures. All seven trenches were oriented
perpendicular to the street and are described herein as being oriented north-south. Trench
1 was placed in tract 13120 and was situated east of ST 17. The trench was 13 m long and
was excavated to the maximum depth of the backhoe reach but wall caving obscured the
base of the trench walls and did not allow access into the trench. The upper 40 cm of the
fill as observed in the eastern wall (Figure 69) contained an abundance of plain faced
commercial red bricks. The layer below averaged 1.5 m in thickness and contained
massive amounts of concrete and asphalt. Asphalt was more common in the southern half
of the trench. Paver bricks impressed with âTHURBERâ were made between 1897 and
1931 when the Thurber brick plant was in operation (Hardman 1975:84). Several pieces
of clear window glass date between 1800 and 1920 based upon glass thickness (Moir
1988:271). Along with the window glass, several pieces of bottle glass were collected.
Based upon the rim finish and type, a clear glass hand finished bottle neck with a patent
lip finish was made before 1900 as was a hand-finished bottle neck with a packer finish
(Berge 1968). A Hemingray-12 glass telephone insulator that was manufactured between
the late 1890âs and 1950âs was collected from the fill. The skirt of the insulator was
missing and consequently finer dating was not possible. The lowest recorded layer
extended from approximately 2.0 m to 2.5 m below the surface and was fill dirt mixed
with bricks and other trash. Some of the bricks were hand-made but others were
commercially manufactured. Bedrock was not reached in the bottom of the trench and the
trench extended to below three meters but the fill was so loose that it continued to
collapse and it was impossible to collect samples or describe the fill below 2.5 m. It was
concluded that the fill in at least the north end of Trench 1 represents materials deposited
on the slope of the bluff.

Trench 2 was placed 9 m east of Trench 1 and was situated closer to the street than
Trench 1. The trench was 18 m long (Figure 70). Bedrock was first encountered in the
south end of the trench at a depth of 84 cm below the surface and extended in a generally
level plane for a distance of 15 m to the north. The surface of the bedrock drops at the
north end of the trench and was defined sufficiently to determine that it begins a
downslope descent at this point. Immediately below the surface and for the full length of
the trench is a layer of mixed fill containing some broken artifacts. Below that and for a
distance of 8 m from the south end of the trench is a layer of friable hand-made bricks
which may be a floor or a pavement (Figure 71). A thin (5 cm) layer of coal is below the
bricks and may have served as bedding material. A zone of degrading limestone bedrock
is below the coal and it extends the full length of the trench. The bricks indicate pre-1900
construction but no evidence of a structure in this location is shown on the Sanborn maps.
Furthermore, the thin layer of fill above the bricks and present the full length of the
trench leads to the conclusion that if foundations for the Novelty Roller Mills were
present in the early 1900s, they were subsequently removed and probably pushed over the
edge of the bluff.
Pieces of plain undecorated whiteware were collected along with a butter knife, clay
flower pot base, crockery, bottle glass, and a rust encrusted piece of metal which is
probably a nail. A complete medicine bottle had a makers mark of Hazel-Atlas which
used the HA mark between 1920-1964 (Toulouse 1972: 239).

Figure 70.
Trench 2 looking to the
north. Note the red on both east and west
walls in the foreground.
The remaining pieces were all thick enough to possibly be plate glass and thus harder to
date. There was one handmade brick which can be presumed to predate 1900 before the
commercial bricking industry became prominent (Gurcke 1987: 42-47). Twelve pieces of
window glass were collected. Of these, three dated between 1920 and 1980 and one dated
between 1800 and 1920 (Moir 1988:271).
Trench 3 was also placed in Tract # 13120 but to the west of a paved parking lot in a
narrow area that is enclosed by a chain link fence and is shown as Figure 68 above. The
trench was 6 m long and bedrock was encountered at 98 cm below the surface in the
south end. The bedrock extended north on a level plane for a distance of four meters
before descending to a depth of more than 2.5 m. A layer of concrete mixed with some
fill dirt was 4 cm thick at the south end and gets thicker as it continues to the north, being
40 cm thick at the north. The lower fill layer contained a variety of twentieth century
artifacts including metal, commercially made bricks, concrete, plastic bread wrappers,
and other discarded trash (Figures 72). A large slab of concrete was encountered in the
north end of the trench at a distance of seven meters south of the present day bluff. The
slab did not appear to be in-place and probably represents a structural foundation or wall
that was pushed off the edge of the bluff and then covered with soil to level the surface.

Trenches 4 and 5 were excavated to determine if the brick surface was present to the east
of Trench 2. Both trenches were five meters north of East Bluff Street and Trench 5 was a
meter west of Trench 4. Trench 4 was six meters long and Trench 5 was four meters long.
Bedrock was encountered at 70 cm below the surface. The first 40 cm below the surface
contained limestone gravel and rock mixed with brown (10YR4/3) sandy clay. Below this
is a thin 10 cm thick zone of degraded brick mixed with yellowish red (5YR4/6) sandy
clay. A 20 cm thick layer of charcoal and rock with a dark grayish brown (10YR4/2)
sandy loam with a 10% strong brown (7.5YR5/8) mottling sits above the limestone
bedrock. The degraded brick appears to correspond to the layer noted in Trench 2 but it is
not a brick paved surface. As before, the presence of the thin layer of topsoil does not
leave room for structures to have been on this surface and it is most likely that the
buildings were pushed off the edge of the bluff and that some topsoil was spread over the
bladed surface.
Trench 6 was started 9.5 m north of the E. Bluff sidewalk and was excavated to a
maximum depth of approximately 4.7 m and six distinct zones were exposed in the west
wall (Figure 73). Zone I was the most recent fill episode and thickens from the south
where it is less than ten cm thick to the north end of the trench where it is 230 cm thick.
The zone was composed of limestone gravel, sandy loam, occasional asphalt pieces, and
small brick fragments. Zone II starts in the north end of the profile and extends north. It
was from 230-275 cm below the surface and was composed of large limestone rocks
measuring 50 by 50 cm. Zone III starts in the middle of the profile and follows the old
ground surface to the north. It was from 275-305 cm that contained brick fragments, fired
and unfired. Zone IV was gravel and decomposed limestone. The remaining layer, Zone
V was aligned at an angle due to the way it was deposited. They appeared to have been
dumped into the area and were composed of mortared brick fragments, uncut rock, and
handmade, unfired brick in uneven layers. The base of a brick wall (Figure 75) was
exposed in the profile and was anchored on top of cut limestone blocks and continued to
the east on top of the limestone bedrock that is shown in Figure 75. No floor to this
apparent basement had been preserved and the upper parts of the walls had apparently
been pushed over the bluff when the structure was destroyed.
Five pieces of plain whiteware were recovered from Trench 6, and none of them had a
makers mark. Two center cut ham steak bones, a mussel shell, a rusty metal piece were
collected, none were dateable. Of the 6 pieces of bottle glass collected, only one had a
rim was hand-turned with a two piece mold dating it pre-1900. One piece of window
glass dated to between 1920 and 1980 (Moir 1988:271). Six bricks were collected from
the trench fill, two were âTHURBERâ bricks that date from 1897-1931. Two of the
bricks were stamped with âMO. F B & C CO ST LOUIS, MOâ which is the Fire, Brick
and Clay Company of St Louis and date to the 1930âs (Gurcke 1987:302). The remaining
two bricks were faceless and were not dateable.

looking to the south.

The seventh trench (Figure 75) was placed 6.5 m north of E. Bluff Street. The trench was
7.75 meters long and the bluff edge was encountered at 65 cm below the surface in the
south end (Figure 76). It dips to 2.90 m below the surface 4 m to the north. Zone I
averages 25 cm and was composed of crushed limestone rock mixed with a light brown
sandy loam. The second zone contained decomposing concrete and was only 25 cm deep
at the south end gradually increasing to 50 cm on the north end of the trench. In the south
end of the trench, a one meter long zone of asphalt extends to the north. A 60 cm long
concrete slab was under asphalt. The bottom fill layer continued to the bedrock and
contained rock and rubble including cellophane and plastic bread bags. A buried 2" PVC
water pipe runs perpendicular to the trench, but may be part of the fill.

In conclusion, trenching north of E. Bluff Street found no preserved historic structural
remains buried below the present ground surface. The base of an apparent basement wall
was exposed in Trench 6 but the floor was not preserved and the upper walls on the west
and south sides are missing and no evidence was found of walls on the east and north.
Everywhere, the surface of the original limestone bluff has been covered with mixed fill
episodes and the edge of the bluff has been extended more than ten meters to the north as
the result of pushing rocks, asphalt, and bricks down the slope. No evidence was found to
demonstrate the presence of preserved historic structures between East Bluff Street and
the present bluff. It is our conclusion that the same will be found to be true in the blocks
south of East Bluff Street because the historic standing structures that once were present
have been demolished and probably disposed of by being dumped over the bluff edge.
The potential of finding subterranean features such as basements, cisterns and outhouses
is likewise low because of the massive limestone bedrock and city services were
providing water and waste disposal in the late 1800s.

FLOODPLAIN TESTING

On June 1st and 2nd, 2006, five trackhoe trenches were excavated in the floodplain of the
West Fork of the Trinity River south of Fourth Street and on the east side of North Main
Street (Figure 77). The floodplain is mapped as Quaternary alluvium (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1972) and is described as occasionally flooded Frio clay (Ressel
1981:91-92). A man-made earthen levee is situated on the edge of the floodplain and a
road is on the levee crest. A running path is situated between the levee and the river bank
and all excavation was confined in the level floodplain that is situated inside the levee.
The surface of the floodplain contained residences as well as various commercial
buildings in the past as described in a previous chapter. Virtually all evidence of this past
landuse in the form of structural foundations or surface artifacts is no longer present.
Furthermore, knolls or other elevated locations were apparently not present or were
previously leveled. Cattle may have been driven over the property in the 1800s or may
have been kept here while waiting for the stock yards to be come available.
The surface of the floodplain provided good ground exposure but no evidence of
occupation older than fifty years was discovered during the pedestrian survey. Trenches
were placed in level areas where it was anticipated that undisturbed sediments would be
encountered. Buried utilities had been flagged prior to our investigation and were avoided
as were elevated utilities that cross through the area. Roads and the levee toe were also
avoided when trench locations were selected. Trenching was confined to the 18 acre
floodplain east of North Main Street and inside the levee. The realized testing area was
further reduced by the roads, buried and elevated utilities, and substation that are present
within the tract. No trenching was done west of North Main due to changes in plans mde
by the Tarrant County College.
Two of the trench profiles are described in Tables 2 and 3 below. The other three
trenches were observed and are discussed in the paragraphs that follow but they were not
profiled due to contamination.
Trench 8 was placed in the northwest part of the tract and was oriented roughly east-west
parallel to the bend in the river. The trench was 8 m long and was dug to a depth of 5.1
m. The 3 foot wide trackhoe bucket provided good exposure. No cultural materials were
encountered below 180 cm and those above were deposited some time since 1920 and
furthermore are not in primary context.

Fill consists of small pieces of limestone rock, a mixed collection of sandy
loam and clay, a few scattered pieces of commercially-made red brick, and a
piece of Damascus-Twist rebar. The horizon boundary was very abrupt and
smooth. Damascus-Twist rebar was used to reinforce concrete and predates the
ribbed rebar that became popular between 1920 and 1930 (Trask and Skinner
2002:15).

180-210
Dusky red (10R3/4) clay moderately weak, soft to slightly hard, very fine
subangular blocky. Very few thin clay films on ped faces. Very fine pores, very
few rootlets. Clear smooth horizon boundary.
210-320
Dark gray (7.5YR4/1) clay with red (10R4/8) stains and filaments.
Moderately weak to moderate, slightly hard, very fine to fine prismatic. Few clay
films that are thin on ped faces with beginning of slickensides. No rootlets, pores
are dendritic tubular. Abrupt smooth horizon boundary.
320-405
Gray (10YR5/1) clay with very fine filaments of CaCO3. Moderate,
slightly hard, medium prismatic. Few to common clay films on ped faces with
slickensides. Pores are dendritic tubular. Gradual smooth horizon boundary.
405-510+
Grayish brown (10YR5/2) clay with filaments of CaCO3. Moderately
weak, slightly hard, fine to medium prismatic. Clay films are few, thin on ped
faces. Pores are dendritic tubular.
The 320-405 zone in Trench 8 may correspond to the 330-339 cm C2 zone described in
C29 core reported by Geo-Marine (Osburn et al. 2005:A-17). If so the overlying
sediments in the two units are dramatically different.
Trench 9 was located closer to the channel and was oriented perpendicular to the river
and was 8.5 m long and ~5.0 m deep. When the trackhoe removed the upper fill, there
was a faint petroleum smell emanating from the deepest darker soils. In the upper part of
the profile, just below the cement casement (Figure 79), there were red brick fragments
and some charred material suggesting that part of the zone was from a burned structure.
It must be stressed that none of the archaeologists or archaeology technicians were
trained to handle contaminated or hazardous materials or to obtain samples for testing.
Our best guide was our senses and the smell of a petroleum byproduct meant that the
soils were not going to be handled. Figure 79 shows the profile of Trench 8, on the left,
with that of Trench 9, on the right showing the differences in colors between the deepest
soils of the two trenches. Note the concrete casement in Trench 9 that sits between the fill
material and the much darker lower sediment.
In addition to disturbance below the fill, the trackhoe also encountered a large concrete
slab. After consulting with the trackhoe operator and personnel from Austin Commercial,
it was concluded that the concrete could be a casement or sleeve that had been pored
around a pipe. If this is a pipe, it was not marked prior to our excavation. TXU and
Atmos had flagged their respective buried cables and pipes. Our only impact on the
concrete were scrape marks from the trackhoe bucket. Other than the fill material
constituting the top soil zone of this trench and the concrete casement, this trench did not
contain buried cultural resources.

Trenches 8 and 9 showing fill material, floodplain sediments and
contaminated soils, respectively, and a concrete casement encountered
during excavation. Note color differences in lower soils of the two
trenches.

Trenches 10 and 11 were placed further to the east and northeast of Trench 9. Trench 10
was perpendicular to the river and was ~8 m long by 4.8 m deep. Trench 11 was parallel
to the river and it was 8.5 m long and 5.1 m deep.
Both trenches were contaminated, however the contaminate appeared to be from a broken
sewer pipe, based on the smell. Yet no water was encountered during excavation of these
two trenches. Trench 10 had a distinctly stronger smell. Based on the slight south
southeast slope of this floodplain the source of the contamination could be upslope to the
west or north. The lack of water, which would suggest a broken or leaky pipeline in the
trench, would suggest that the smell is from a plume of contaminate rather than a pipe. It
is possible that the encasement noted in Trench 9 is the source and that it has been
breeched somewhere to the north, where the ground is slightly higher. The same type of
fill material noted in Trench 8, was encountered in Trenches 10 and 11, depths of the fill
material was 240 cm and 224 cm respectively. No buried cultural materials were noted in
the profiles or in the backdirt.

Trench 12 was moved to its location in order to avoid the overhead transmission line that
crosses the tract. The profile is similar to Trench 8.

Reddish black (10R 2.5/1) clay. Moderate, hard to very hard fine
subangular blocky. Clay films are few, thin on ped faces. Few roots and pores are
dendritic tubular. Gradual smooth horizon boundary.
230-270
Dark gray (7.5YR3/1) clay. Moderate, slightly hard coarse prismatic. Clay
films are common, moderately thick on ped faces and pore linings w/slickensides.
Clear smooth horizon boundary.
270-305
Dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) clay with CaCO3 filaments. Moderate,
slightly hard, very coarse prismatic. Clay films are continuous, moderately thick
on ped faces, pore linings w/slickensides. Gradual smooth boundary.
305-361
Same description as above with exception of more CaCO3 filaments. Clear
smooth horizon boundary.
361-520+
Brown (10YR4/3) clay with CaCO3 filaments. Moderately strong, slightly
hard, fine to medium wedge. Clay films are continuous, thick, on ped faces, pore
linings w/slickensides.

All of the trenches shown in Figure 78 recorded fill that consisted of limestone rock and
mixed sandy loam and clay. Based on the trench locations and the fairly consistent fill
thickness, the entire site appears to be covered with fill. The five trenches excavated for
this project are somewhat typical of what is or can be encountered when digging in an
urban floodplains. These are places where there have been dramatic changes that started
when the land was cleared for farming. Subsequent mining for materials such as gravel
and sand, levee construction, river channelizing, and installing various pipelines have
impacted this environment. These impacts are usually not clearly seen on the surface and
have not been well documented in the past.
This is not to say there are no locations with undisturbed buried archaeological sites in
the West Fork floodplain. Indeed, Osburn, Shanabrook, and Peter (2005:49-53) recorded
three new sites and revisited one previously recorded site in a 291 acre non-contiguous
area in the West Fork floodplain located upstream and downstream from the TCC project
area.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The present chapter consists of three parts. The first is a series of recommendations
developed by Cornerstone in conjunction with archival research and previously presented
in the âHistoric Contextâ chapter. These included recommendations with regard to
Historic American Buildings Survey recording of historic buildings prior to demolition or
modification. Also included are suggestions about the archaeological potential of the
various blocks and the West Fork floodplain based on their analysis of the historic maps
that are reviewed in detail above. In the second section of this chapter, these
recommendations are tempered by the results of archaeological testing that was done
north of Bluff Street where it was found that foundations had not been preserved and that
demolished buildings and roads as well as trash had been pushed off the bluff edge. The
third section presents recommendations about how this project might have been managed
in order to avoid the present dilemma.
Historic Research Recommendations
The recommended investigation sites are based on the following criteria: long-term use of
a particular parcel of land, few subsequent uses, sites recently demolished and/or cleared,
and extant properties. An example is the Concho Wagon Yard that was located for
approximately 45 years at the corner of E. Belknap and N. Jones.
The following areas were recommended:
â¢

â¢
â¢

â¢

Block 2, high recommendation to excavate the Novelty Roller Mill site on the
north side of E. Bluff between Jones and Grove, approximately 65 60 70 feet from
E. Bluff to the edge of the bluff and approximately 50 feet from the west property
line and 35 to 40 feet from the east property line. This site was never redeveloped
after the mill was torn down and is the site that may have the most potential. It is
also recommended to excavate 419 E. Bluff where the Undertakers Stable stood.
The approximate location was 80 feet off E. Bluff on the east side.
Residential sites along the north side of E. Bluff between N. Grove and Pecan
show promise as demolition and removal of the structures occurred as recently as
the summer of 2003.
Blocks 2 and 3, medium to high recommendation for excavation of this site where
the Natatorium Steam Laundry was located at 101-105 Belknap (north side of
Belknap) and between Main and Commerce was another long-time business and
indicates potential.
Block 10 (also known as Block 4), low recommendation for excavation, however
there was a well located in this block in 1885, but several structures were built
over the well beginning in 1889.

Block 11, low to medium recommendation for excavation at the Penderyâs site at
304 E. Belknap. This site is eligible for Section 106 Review and HABS Level 3
documentation is recommended.
Block 15, medium recommendation for excavation, the location for the Walter
Huffman Public School, is another site to investigate. The two story brick
building with a basement was constructed in 1910 and was not demolished until
about 20 years ago. The block is now occupied by Texas Capital Bank.
Block 16, high recommendations for excavation. Bounded by E. Belknap, N.
Pecan, E. Weatherford and N. Grove, has several extant buildings. Several of the
properties have privies and sheds. Section 106 Review is recommended for 500,
504 and 514 E. Belknap as well as 507 and 511 E. Weatherford. HABS Level 3
documentation is recommended for the houses located at 514 E. Belknap and 511
E. Weatherford. HABS Level 1 documentation is recommended for 500 and 504
E. Belknap and 501 and 507 E. Weatherford. Excavation is recommended for the
vacant lot at 510 E. Belknap at the intersection of the east and the south property
lines as there was a shed/privy located approximately 100 feet back from the
north property line or street/curb line. A second shed/privy was located west of
the other privy/shed approximately 25 feet.
Block 1, high recommendation for excavation. The two extant buildings at 201203 and 205-207 E. Belknap may yield information, and Section 106 Review is
recommended for 205-207 E. Belknap and 215 E. Belknap. HABS Level 1
documentation is recommended for 205-207 E. Belknap.
Block 12, low recommendation for excavation in this block. Until the 1970âs,
there were two commercial buildings located in the middle of the block.
Block 13, high recommendation for excavation as this block contained the
Concho Wagon Yard for many years which has been replaced by a parking lot. It
was located on the south half of this block. The houses at 400 and 402 E. Bluff
were recently demolished. They had out buildings that may yield information.
Excavation is recommended at 404 E. Bluff where a privy/shed was located in the
southwest corner about five feet from the property line.
Block 14, low to medium recommendation for excavation at 503 and 503 Â½ E.
Bluff. A privy/shed was located 25 feet north and 10 feet east of the property line
for the house at 503 E. Bluff and another was located 100 feet back of 503 Â½ E.
Bluff at the northwest corner of the lot.
North Main Street, high recommendation for excavation. The TP&L site where
the plant is located has always been an industrial site and therefore has potential
for excavation. Hermann Park was located on this site and there may be potential
there. This includes the Optional Tract that was the location of Humble Oil and
Refining. There may be footings for a bridge that crossed the Trinity west of the
Paddock Viaduct. The TP&L plant is eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places. HABS Level 1 documentation is recommended.

The project area had included the TXU site, originally the Fort Worth Power and Light
Power Plant. This building has been deemed eligible for the National of Historic Places
and is listed in the Tarrant County Historic Resources Survey.

The following extant structures are located in the project area and reflect the growth and
development of the Bluff area. These properties may be eligible for the National Register
and need further documentation.
1. 205-207 E. Belknap
ca. 1910
This handsome two story commercial building was constructed around 1910 and
had two apartments upstairs. It housed the Pendery familyâs Mexican Chili
Supply from 1910 to the 1950âs when they moved locations. The building is a
two-part commercial structure that is relatively intact although it is vacant and has
been boarded up. It has a stepped parapet with decorative brickwork at the cornice
line and around the arched windows. The original 6 cast iron columns are still
intact across the front (south) faÃ§ade of the building. They define the display
windows and the doors. The wood windows are intact on the second floor and on
most of the building. The east faÃ§ade has an inset with windows on the second
floor for the apartments. The north faÃ§ade has windows and doors across first and
second floors. The doors for the second floor apartments are still intact however
the stair has been removed.
2. 215 E. Belknap
ca. 1937
The small brick building at 215 E. Belknap was constructed around 1937 for
automotive uses. It is an intact example of an early automotive building in
downtown. The building is a one story brick structure with a metal canopy. The
south faÃ§ade has a large multi-pane window that wraps the building on to the east
faÃ§ade. The window and the clipped corner give the building a streamline modern
look. The east faÃ§ade has two garage openings and the south and west facades
have window openings.
3. 304 E. Belknap
ca. 1953
This building houses Penderyâs Chili Supply, a Fort Worth business since 1870.
The Chili Supply is possibly one of the oldest continuous businesses in Fort
Worth. The structure is an example of a small scale 1950âs commercial structure.
The front is a buff brick with common brick on the side and rear facades. The
display and second floor windows have been replaced but the original
configuration has remained.
The Block bounded by E. Belknap, Grove, E. Weatherford and Pecan is the most
intact block in the Bluff project area. The following are the structures included on
that block. Although some have been altered, they present a cohesive block of
structures from the early 1900s to the 1940s.
4. 500 E. Belknap
ca. 1910
This structure was constructed around 1910 as two apartments. The physical
features of the structure are late Queen Anne. The original porch has been
enclosed and some of the windows have been altered. There is a side entrance for
the other apartment and the chimneys are still intact. Although the building has

been altered, it is one of a hand full of original residential structures left in the
north end of downtown and the Bluff area.
504 E. Belknap
ca. 1905
This late Queen Anne was constructed between 1905 and 1910. The Sanborn Fire
Insurance Map for 1911 indicates brick veneer on the house. The porch has been
enclosed and the windows are boarded up. Although the building has been
somewhat altered, it is one of a hand full of original residential structures left in
the north end of downtown and the Bluff area.
514 E. Bluff
ca. 1936
This apartment building was constructed around 1936. It is a two story brick
building. The windows have been altered on the structure.
511 E. Weatherford
ca. 1935
This two story stucco apartment building was constructed about 1935. Originally,
it would have had a tile canopy roof where it is now composition shingle. This
feature and the stucco finish would give the building a Spanish Revival look that
was very common for the 1930s. It had four apartments, two downstairs and two
upstairs. Behind the apartment is a garage apartment of the same style. The
windows and doors have been replaced but the original location and size remains
the same. The garage apartment has the original wood windows.
507 E. Weatherford
ca. 1920
This structure is a one story frame house built around 1920. It is an excellent,
intact example of the Craftsmen Bungalow style. It is one of a hand full of
original residential structures left in the north end of downtown and the Bluff
area.
501 E. Weatherford
ca. 1920
This structure is a one story brick house built around 1920. It is an excellent,
intact example of the Craftsmen Bungalow style. It is one of a hand full of
original residential structures left in the north end of downtown and the Bluff
area.

The above recommendations were presented to the architect, the Corps of Engineers, and
the Texas Historical Commission when the first draft of this report was completed on
September 30, 2005. At that time, shovel testing and backhoe trenching had been
conducted north of East Bluff and this had failed to uncover any preserved structural
foundations. In reviewing the report, the Texas Historical Commission requested that
additional testing be done but did not comment on the recommendations that some of the
standing structures warranted further documentation in the form of Historic American
Buildings Survey (HABS) drawings, structural plan maps, or photographs. Subsequently,
these buildings were demolished and no further documentation had been done. These
same recommendations were presented in subsequent draft reports and were reconfigured
in this report and combined into the final chapter but they were not significantly altered.

The Texas Historical Commission did not comment on recommendations regarding
documentation of the standing structures because it has no jurisdiction over such
structures under the Antiquities Code of Texas unless they are already listed in the
National Register of Historic Places. However, if federal permits were needed, the THC
would be required to evaluate the National Register eligibility of the structures and make
recommendations regarding the adverse effects under Section 106 of the National
Preservation Act. Since the first review of this report by THC, it has been determined that
a permit will be required by the US Army Corps of Engineers to construct a pedestrian
bridge over the river, so Section 106 review is now required. Although the THC had
stated in at least three letters that construction should not proceed on this project, the
buildings were demolished by the College without consideration of the need for further
documentation.
The Texas Historical Commission commented on the desirability of doing testing under
the paved parking lot areas despite ARCâs findings of extensive disturbance under the
surface north of East Bluff and the absence of foundations and the presence of heavily
mixed deposits, virtually all of which were twentieth century in age. No arrangement was
made by the College to have ARC test in the parking lots south of East Bluff before
construction began. It was our opinion that the potential of finding preserved foundation
bases or the bottoms of cisterns dug into the limestone bedrock was low but ARC was
agreeable to doing the testing. However, we were not advised that construction in the
parking lots was going to start. When we discovered this, we advised the THC that
clearing had begun.
Archaeological Recommendations
Subsurface testing by Fugro and AR Consultants has shown that earthen fill containing
trash, concrete, uncut limestone, asphalt, and brick is the primary material that overlies
the limestone bedrock that forms the bluff area and the adjacent parts of Downtown Fort
Worth. There is no reason to expect that buried structures will be found in the thin layer
of mostly disturbed and reworked soil matrix that covers the bedrock or in the thicker
layers of fill that have been pushed over the bluff edge and have subsequently extended
the bluff to the north. While buried features such as late 1800s privies and cisterns may
be preserved in those rare cases where holes were excavated into the underlying bedrock
and were subsequently filled with clean fill or mixed fill and then sealed by more recent
deposits and ultimately by asphalt, the collection of individual artifacts from these filled
contexts is not likely to significantly contribute to a better understanding of Fort Worth
history. While discovery of sealed deposits might contribute to refining artifact
assemblages in the second half of the 1800s, it is more likely that these hypothesized
filled holes will contain younger artifacts from unknown sources not from the time period
of construction. Furthermore, no artifacts dating to the early period of Fort Worth
settlement were uncovered during testing and there is no reason based on historic
research or archaeological excavation to expect that they will be found in the decidedly
rare subterranean features that might be present north or south of East Bluff under
parking lot or sidewalk surfaces.

Subsurface testing on the floodplain area did not record any buried cultural resources and
the only artifact worth noting was a piece of Damascus twist rebar dating to the early
1900s. Considering the severe subsurface impacts in this area, it is highly unlikely that
intact cultural resources are present. Considering the possible contaminates found during
trenching in the floodplain, it is recommended that any hand excavations undertaken in
this area be done with extreme care. It is also recommended that further soil testing be
conducted before hand excavation is done.
AR Consultants, Inc. did not locate any significant in situ cultural resources during
testing of the Bluff or the Floodplain. Both areas were heavily disturbed before this
investigation began and it was our conclusion that the potential of finding significant
resources preserved on the bluff or in the floodplain is very low. We recommend that the
project be allowed to proceed as planned since further documentation is impossible. If
buried cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should cease in that
area and Texas Historical Commission and the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps
of Engineers should be notified.

Final Recommendations
To have managed this project in a more responsive manner that would have resulted in
significantly more effort and the documentation of several formerly standing historic
structures and possibly the documentation of individual late 1800s and early 1900s
features, the following is recommended:
Â¾ The archival documentation, including the recommendations, could have been
produced as a stand alone document. This could have been done well in advance
of construction and would have highlighted the need to document historic
standing structures and to test in paved areas south of East Bluff. This would have
allowed for the Texas Historical Commission to comment only on these
recommendations and should have triggered an on-site evaluation of the structures
and the archaeological potential of the entire bluff area.
Â¾ The archaeological testing strategy could have used the archival recommendations
to select for specific structures south of East Bluff because this information
guided the testing strategy north of East Bluff. On a smaller scale, this strategy
could have guided parking lot stripping in search of the very few subterranean
features, cisterns and outhouses that are described as being present on some of the
historic maps.
Â¾ An arrangement for regular communication between the cultural resource team,
the architects, the Texas Historical Commission, Tarrant County College, and
concerned Tarrant County preservationists should have been established at the
beginning of the project and maintained throughout.
