Rangia Cuneata as a Seasonal Indicator for Coastal
Archeological Sites in Texas

David L. Carlson

ABSTRACT
Rangia cuneata, a brackish water clam, is commonly found in archeological
sites along the coast of Texas and Louisiana. Because of its abundance and because
of the obvious growth rings on the surface of its valves, Rangia has been a focus
of seasonality studies over the last ten years. Recently, Lawrence Aten (1981)
proposed a method of identifying site seasonality using Rangia valves.
Aten’s dated collections are used to develop a model of Rangia growth
patterns by using cubic splines to smooth and interpolate the known samples. A
FORTRAN program is used to fit archeological samples to the model and provide
a graphic display of the quality of the fit. Sixty-fourpublishedRangia seasonality
determinations are evaluated using this procedure. The analysis of archeological
samples using this technique confirms previous researchers’ conclusions that
Rangia were used along the Texas coast primarily as a spring resource.

INTRODUCTION

The brackish water clam, Rangia cuneata, is common on archeological sites
along the coast of Louisiana and Texas. Along the central Gulf Coast of Texas,
extensive shell middens of Rangia like the one at the Dow-Cleaver site (41BO35)
document the use of large quantities of these clams for food (Aten 1971). At
Dow-Cleaver, piles of circular"floors" of Rangia appear to have been deliberately
constructed for living areas. Although there is some disagreement about whether
Rangia cuneata was a staple (Dillehay 1975c) or a minor supplement (Byrd 1976),
its abundance at many sites suggests that the species was systematically collected
as a food resource.
Rangia cuneata occupy brackish water habitats in estuaries and bays along the
coast, surviving in environments ranging in salinity between 0 and 33 parts per
thousand (Bedford 1972). They are most abundant in the low diversity habitat zone
between freshwater and saltwater environments, where they reach their greatest
population densities (Bedford 1972:99). Ecological studies suggest that the
preference of the species for low salinity environments is a result of heavy predation
and competition in more saline habitats (O’Heeron 1966).
The success ofRangia in brackish habitats, where salinity can change suddenly
and dramatically, is primarily a result of its success at osmoregulation. At salinities
above 10 parts per thousand, Rangia are isosmotic. At lower salinities, however,

Rangia rapidly begin to osmoregulate and control their internal salinity at a
significantly higher level than the surrounding medium (Bedford 1972:99). This
ability buffers the species against sudden salinity shocks and insures that shell
morphology is more likely to be a function of animal growth cycles than of transient
environmental effects.
Perhaps as a result of their ability to survive under adverse environmental
conditions, Rangia cuneata are reported from the Potomac River on the Atlantic
Coast to Avarado, Mexico on the Gulf (TarJer 1971). The species has been in
Louisiana for at least the last 9000 years, and some 5 million cubic yards of dead
shell are dredged in that state every year (Tarver 1971).
Rangia are relatively easy to gather since they reach their highest densities in
shallow water adjacent to sources of fresh- or saltwater (Tarver and Dugas 1973).
In Lakes Pontchartmin and Manrepas in Louisiana, densities can reach 820
individuals 16mm or larger in a single square meter. In the Neches River in Texas,
concentrations of 250 individuals per square meter have been reported ~arver and
Dugas 1973).
Because of their abundance and because of the obvious growth rings on the
surface of their valves,Rangia cuneata have been a focus of seasonality studies over
the last 10 years (Aten 1972,1981; Dillehay 1974, 1975a, 1975b; Skelton 1978). By
studying the indentations on the surface of Rangia shells, Aten devised a technique
for classifying samples of 50 or more shells by growth stages and then fitting the
resulting distribution to a series of modem samples (Aten 1981).
The use of growth increments in bivalve shells to determine environmental
conditions has been the subject of considerable study in recent years. Bivalve
growth patterns that reflect subdaily, daily, bidaily, fortnightly, lunar month, and
annual growth episodes have been identified (Kennish 1980).
Interruptions in growth can be related to freeze, heat, and thermal shock,
abrasion, spawning, neap tides, and storms (Kennish 1980). By microscopic
observation of shell microstructure, it is often possible to distinguish various
environmental shocks and other events in the life of an individual bivalve (Tevesz
and Carter 1980).
This report explores the use ofRangia cuneata for estimating seasonality on
archeologieal sites on the Texas coast. An extension of the techniques originally
proposed by Lawrence Aten (1981) is described and applied to a series of 64
archeologieal samples.

SEASONALITY IN RANGIA CUNEATA
In 1981, Aten published a method for determining seasonality from collections
of Rangia cuneata (Aten 1981). The technique involves examining the exterior
surfaces of the shells for annual rings. Once the annual rings are located, the degree
of growth beyond the last period of growth interruption is estimated. Application
of the procedure involves using estimates of age/size relationships in Rangia
cuneata so that interruptions caused by thermal shock or storm tides are not
mistakenly identified as annual rings. The width ofthering preceding the lastis used

Carlson m Rangia Cuneata as Seasonal Indicator

as a measure of the amount of growth expected in the last ring. If the growth in the
last ring is less than one-third of what is expected, the valve is classified as in the
Early stage. If it is more than one-third, but less than two-thirds, it is classified as
Middle, and if it is more than two-thirds, it is classified as Late. If the last growth
episode appears to be complete, and the valve is currently in an arrested period of
growth, it is classified as Interrupted; if the rings cannot be clearly identified, the
valve is classified as Indeterminate. Since the evaluation of any single valve is
subject to error, Aten recommends that samples of at least 50 valves of one side (i.e.
all left or all right valves) be used. Blind tests involving Aten and Dillehay and Aten
and the author indicate that independent assessments of single samples are comparable.
Once estimates have been made for a sample of valves (preferably at least 50),
the distribution of the sample is compared to empirical distributions made by Aten
from modem collections along the Texas coast.
The samples vary in size from 14 to 50 individuals. Aten combines these
samples into half-month periods. Dated samples are available for 18 of the 24
half-month periods in the year.
Seasonality estimates are made by picking the empirical distribution that most
closely matches the sample. The method has been criticized on various grounds;
one criticism is that the surface morphology of bivalves in general cannot be used
to identify annual cycles reliably (Monks 1981, Claassen 1982). Study of thin
sections or acetate peels of thick sections certainly are more reliable methods than
observation of surface morphology or estimating the age or season of a single
individual, but the cost and time involved in analyzing sections of each specimen
greatly limit the number of specimens that can be examined. Although study of
surface morphology is less precise, the errors in that method may average out if
sample sizes are large enough. Examination of surface annual rings has been used
in at least one ecological study to produce demographic life tables for Rangia
(Fairbanks 1963).
Another criticism has been that the determination of seasonality from surface
morphology overestimates the expected growth in the last year by comparing it to
the penultimate growth ring, since growth rates slow as the individuals become
older. This imprecision would be more important if the exact width of the ring were
involved in the estimate. Since only the nearest third is estimated and since the
reduction in growth rates is relatively small from one year to the next, the effect is
likely to be negligible. More importantly, the same inaccuracy occurs in the
empirical data. Since both the sample and the empirical data may underestimate the
"true" proportion of Late stage clams, there is no systematic bias in the prediction
as suggested by Monks (1981). To resolve this problem, steps have been taken to
systematize the fitting procedure and to provide a graphic display of the goodness
offit between the unknown sample and the dated samples.
The dated samples collected by Aten represent several localities along the
coast. For this reason, they are viewed best as an approximation of the average
trends of growth forRangia. Examining the plots for the different growth categories
emphasizes this fact. Each growth category should be characterized by a single

peak. Secondary, smaller peaks probably reflect sampling fluctuations or unique
conditions (see Aten 1981, Figure 4).
What is needed is a smooth cupJe that follows the rise, peak, and decline of each
growth category through the years but ignores the smaller fluctuations. Several
techniques are available for smoothing "noisy" data. These techniques also permit
estimates of the expected proportions in the six half-month periods for which there
are no samples. One technique would be to fit nonlinear curves to the data, for
example, polynomial functions by least squares or by iterative techniques designed
for nonlinear regression. Another would be to smooth the data using the exploratory
data techniques described by Hartwig and Dearing (1979) and others. The first
approach would have the possible disadvantage of smoothing the data too much.
The latter approach would make estimates for the gaps somewhat more difficult, and
the degree of smoothing could not be easily controlled.
A third approach, which overcomes these deficiencies, is to use cubic splines,
which are simply a series of separate cubic polynomials fitted to the intervals

between dated samples. A cubic spline is continuous and has continuous first and
second derivatives. This latter condition assures that the curve will have a smooth
overall appearance. The spline function can be used to smooth noisy data values and
to interpolate between known points (Reinsch 1967, Wold 1974).
In order to smooth the dated samples published by Aten, a FORTRAN program
was written using a subroutine provided in the International Mathematics and
Statistics Library (1980) for smoothing by cubic splines. The subroutine requires
the user to provide a smoothing parameter, which is used to fit the curve. In fitting
the function, each sample was weighted by the number of valves in the sample so
the curve would fit large samples more closely than small ones. A large value was
selected for the smoothing parameter by examining the data, and this value was
progressively reduced to zero. At this point, the spline curve fits the data exactly
(i.e., no smoothing is done). The results were inspected at each increase of the
smoothing parameter, and the smallest value was selected that produced a curve that
rose monotonically to a single peak and then declined monotonically. Curves were
calculated independently for Interrupted ~igure 1), Early, Middle, and Late growth
stages. The expected proportions for each half-month period in the year were
calculated for each growth category (Table 1). The uncertain category was
computed by summing the four growth stages and subtracting the result from 1.0.
Table 1, then, represents a model of a full year’s expected Rangia growth that is

based on the dated samples.
If the calibrated data really reflect the seasonal growth patterns of Rangia
cuneata, they should be correlated with environmental factors known to affect
Rangia growth. Data on air temperature (Aten 1981) and water temperature (Texas
Parks andWildlife Department 1963,1964,1965,1966,1967,1968,1969/70,1972,
1973) in the Galveston Bay area were examined and found to be highly correlated
(r=+.9912). Rangia in the Early, Middle, or Late stages can be considered to be
growing, so the sum of these categories should be correlated with temperature. The
correlation between air temperature and the proportion of Rangia in the Early,
Middle, or Late stage is +.9254. In addition, Aten (1981:195) notes that growth in

Figure 3. Aten’s late April and mid-October samples combined to illustrate a poor fit to the
Rangia seasonality model. The best fit is mid-April. The error sum of squares is 0.069020.
The mean squared error is 0.146743 with variance 0.004675.

proportion of growing Rangia should come in June (mean temperature 81.5°). In
July and August, when the mean temperature increases to 83°F, the proportion of
growing Rangia declines. These data strongly suggest that the major growth cycles
of the species have been captured in the model.
In order to match undated samples to the model, a second FORTRAN computer
program was written. This program compares the sample proportions with each of
the model predictions. For each of the 24 comparisons a goodness--of-fit measure
is calculated that involves summing the differences between the observed and
expected proportions for the four growth periods (the unknown category is not used
in fitting the sample to model). The half-month period with smallest error sum of
squares is selected as the best fit. For each sample, the program displays the error
sum of squares for each half-month period and draws a histogram that reflects the
degree of fit or lack of fit over the whole year. A sample that fits the model will have
a valley in the histogram that indicates a close fit with that half-month or group of
half-months. A deep, narrow valley indicates a close fit with a single half-month,

208

whereas a broad, gradual valley indicates a poorer fit with any particular half-month
but a general fit with a particular season.
To judge the accuracy of the model and the fitting program, the 18 dated
samples were submitted for seasonality estimates. Thirteen of the samples were
estimated to the exact half-month of their collection. The remaining five samples
were placed in an adjacent half-month interval. All of the samples then, were
classified within a half-month of their true dates. All of the"errors" occurred in the
late summer and early fall months when growth is slowing and most of the valves
are in the Late or Interrupted stage. In addition, the valleys tend to be broader in the
late summer and fall, indicating that changes are taking place more gradually and
that, therefore, it is more difficult to distinguish between adjacent periods. Aten’s
mid-July collection is illustrated as an example of a close fit between the model data
and a modem collection (Figure 2). The results of the test also provide some data
on how well good samples can be expected to fit the model (Table 2). Archeological
samples cannot be expected to fit the model as closely as the data from which the
model was generated do, but very poor fits should be regarded with suspicion.

seasonality model. The best fit is late April. The error sum of squares is 0.002815. The mean
squared error is 0.2924785 with variance 0.029107.

Next, a series of mixed samples was created by combining dated samples from
different seasons. The purpose of these experiments was to see if, for example, by
mixing spring and fall collections, the program would erroneously estimate a
summer or winter collection. The results (Figure 3) showed that a bimodal
distribution is created by mixing samples from disparate seasons, which is readily
identified as a poor fit to the model; no half-month period fits well. An added
advantage to the program, then, is that mixed or otherwise inappropriate samples
can be readily identified and eliminated.
A second series of experiments was run simulating collection over a single
season. In these tests, all of the dated samples from a single season were combined
(Figure 4). The best estimate is consistently within the range of the known sample
dates. The valleys appear to be somewhat broader than for single samples, however,
the difference is subtle. This suggests that samples representing a particular season
and samples representing a single collection episode cannot be distinguished from
one another. For example, combining all of the spring collections produces a
composite sample that fits the Late April and Mid-May model values (Figure 4).
This suggests too that the accuracy of this technique for seasonality estimates may
be as good as +1 1/2 months. Considering the simplicity of the technique and the
level of our current understanding of seasonal exploitation by prehistoric populations, this level of accuracy is impressive.
Next, a series of 64 published archeological samples ofRangia, from Chambers
County on the upper Texas coast to Calhoun County on the central Texas coast, was
analyzed (Table 3). Thirteen of the samples provided relatively poorfits to any of
the half-month periods; 51 samples fit one of the model periods. The sample from
the Anaqua site (41JK7) (Story 1968) is illustrated as an example of a good fit
(Figure 5). The analysis shows that the estimates range between mid-April and late
July, a four-month period spanning spring and early summer. Despite differences
in location along the coast and time period, it is clear that the the use of Rangia by
the prehistoric inhabitants of the coast was highly seasonal (Table 4). This confirms

the results of Aten, (1979), Dillehay (1974, 1975b), and Skelton (1978). Some of
the sites listed in Table 3 probably were occupied only for a single season. Others,
however, are larger, multicomponent occupations of specific areas. The fight
clustering of Rangia seasonality determinations suggests a highly scheduled
subsistence pattern involving movements along the coast and, perhaps, inland as
well.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I would like to thank Gentry Steele for encouraging me to work on theRangia
seasonality problem for a paper presented at the annual meeting of the Society for
American Archaeology in Pittsburgh. I also thank Lawrence Aten for initiating
Rangia seasonality studies by collecting the control samples and recognizing the
potential of the technique. Some of his comments on the original paper have been
incorporated here. Texas A&M University provided the computer facilities for
conducting the analyses. A program to fit Rangia samples to the model distributions, which will run on IBM or compatible microcomputers, is available from the
author.
