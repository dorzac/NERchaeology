Excavations at the Terri and Lightfoot Sites,
Proctor Reservoir, Comanche County, Texas
ELTON R. PREWITT
ABSTRACT
The Terri and Lightfoot sites, at Proctor Reservoir, Comanche County, Texas,
were partially excavated in 1963 by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project. Both
sites contained numerous milling stones in their lower levels and materials of
Edwards Plateau Aspect, Central Texas Aspect, and Henrietta Focus association
in their upper levels.

INTRODUCTION

During the summer of 1963 (from June 13 to July 10) the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project (T.A.S.P.) conducted excavations at
two sites in Proctor Reservoir, Comanche County, Texas. This work
was carried out in partial fulfillment of Memorandum of Agreement
No. 14-10-0333-956 between the National Park Service and The
University of Texas, providing for salvage excavations in advance of
construction at Proctor. Previously, a preliminary survey of the Proctor Reservoir area had been made by the T.A.S.P. in the fall of 1959
(Jelks and Tunnell, 1960). This survey succeeded in locating a total
of 40 archeological sites, most of which were shallow and extensively
damaged by plowing and erosion. Two of them, however, seemed
worthy of investigation, and therefore they were partially excavated
in 1963. They are the Eli Terri Site, located on the Sabanna River
and the F. H. Lightfoot Site on the Leon River (Fig. 1). The excavations at those two sites are reported herein.
The results were not spectacular. Relatively few artifacts were
obtained, and the only occupational features were several concentrations of sandstone fragments. Since the loose, sandy soil of the area
does not tend to be geologically stratified, the recognition of meaningful artifact sequences is difficult. Nevertheless, the data indicate that
both sites were occupied earliest by peoples who used relatively large
numbers of milling stones, and later by peoples who had fewer milling
stones but a relative abundance of projectile points, scrapers, and
knives . Although "pure" components could not be isolated in the
poorly stratified deposits, elements considered more or less diagnostic

of the Edwards Plateau Aspect, the Central Texas Aspect, and the
Henrietta Focus were found in the upper levels of both sites.
Proctor Dam, a large earthen structure, is under construction near
the mouth of Rush Creek, approximately three miles southwest of the
small town of Proctor in Comanche County. Some water has already
been impounded, and the reservoir will shortly be filled to the level
of the conservation pool, 1162 feet above sea level. The five-year flood
pool will attain a maximum elevation of 1172 feet, which will inundate
major portions of both the Terri and Lightfoot sites.
Proctor Reservoir is located just east of the Edwards Plateau, a division of the Great Plains Physiographic Province (Fenneman, 1931:
50-54) . In the immediate vicinity of the reservoir the topography is
characterized by low, rolling hills, and the soil is an unconsolidated
sand, normally held in place by vegetation. Sub-soil formations are
clays or thinly bedded sandstone. ·The reservoir area falls within the
Balconian Biotic Province (Blair, 1950: 112-115), a region containing a mixture of Eastern and W estem faunal elements. Characteristic
upland trees are Mexican juniper, Texas ash, and stunted live oaks,
while in the stream valleys the most common trees are various oaks,
elms, hack berries, and pecans. Average annual precipitation, measL EON

ured at the Comanche station, is 33 inches; the annual mean temperature is 65 degrees (U. S. Department of Commerce, 1958: 357-360 ).
Prior to the 1959 survey (Jelks and Tunnell, 1960 ) there had been
no systematic archeological investigation in Comanche County. Relic
collectors have been active in the region for many years, but, fortunately, most of them have confined their activities to surface hunting. The materials from the Terri and Lightfoot sites reported herein
constitute the only controlled data for an area that, before 1963, was
virtually unknown archeologically.
THE TERRI SITE

The Terri Site ( 41 CJ 2) is situated on a low hill just south of the
Sabanna River, a tributary of the Leon River (Fig. 2). A county road
crosses the site. Artifacts and other cultural debris are scattered over
about four acres of sandy soil, extending from a wooded area west of
the road eastward through a cultivated field to a deeply eroded gully
just south of the Sabanna flood plain. This site is well knmvn locally as
a source of Indian artifacts, and relatively large numbers of hearthstones, milling stone fragments, and broken flints were observed by
the survey party (Jelks and Tunnell, 1960: 8 ). Since this was one of
the few sites visited during the Proctor survey which appeared to
have sufficient depth for investigation, excavations were carried out
there from June 14 through June 26, 1963.
In the wooded area west of the road, 10 five-foot pits were put down
in a checkerboard grid pattern (Fig. 2) . The excavated pits were
labeled from A through J , from north to south. Excavation reached
a depth of four feet in this portion of the site, which was designated Area A. Approximately 550 feet east of Area A, three five-foot
pits were excavated near the bank of the gully, in what was labeled
Area B. Excavation there reached a depth of five feet below the present
surface.
All of the excavated soil in both areas was passed through quarterinch mesh screen, and excavation proceeded by arbitrary half-foot
vertical intervals.
The soil zones in Areas A and B were virtually identical. The upper
element was a zone of dark gray midden sand extending from the
surface to an average depth of two feet. Sandstone fragments, apparently remnants of fire hearths, were scattered through this midden
deposit, and several concentrations of sandstone rocks were found at
the base of the midden zone. At about two feet deep the midden zone

gave way to tan sand, which contained fewer occupational remains.
This tan sand stratum extended down to the maximum (five feet)
depth of the excavation pits.
OccuPATIONAL FEATURES

The six features found at the Terri Site (Fig. 3) all consisted of
concentrations of sandstone fragments . In five cases the fragments
occurred in roughly oval-shaped piles (Figs . 4, B; 5, B) but in Feature IV they formed a circular basin (Fig. 5, A). The feature s ranged
in length from about 1.5 to about 4.0 feet; width was 1.0 to 2.2 feet;
thickness was near 0.5 foot in all features . The purpose of these concentrations of stones remains undetermined.
Feature I. Feature I was a roughly oval-shaped heap of stones about
four feet long by two feet wide. It was in the dark sand layer, approximately 0.5 to 1.0 foot below the surface, in the southeast corner
of Pit H. Although several of the stones were standing on edge, they
seemed to be arranged in no particular pattern.
Feature II. Feature II (Fig. 4, B) was a concentration of sandstone
fragments in the south side of Pit G. Extending from a depth of 1.2 to

1. 7 feet below the surface, this feature measured 1.5 feet wide by 3.5
feet long. The fragments did not seem to form an orderly pattem.
Feature Ill. Feature III (Fig. 5, B) was a concentration of sandstone fragments located in the southwest portion of Pit D. Measuring
3.3 by 2.2 feet, this feature was 2.0 to 2.5 feet below th e surface. A
number of the stones were slanted in a southeasterly direction, but
they were in no kind of orderly arrangement. A piece of a grinding
slab lay among the stones.

centration of sandstone fragments in the extreme southwestern corner
of Pit C. This feature, approximately two feet in diameter, lay at the
base of the dark sand zone, 1.5 to 2.0 feet below the surface. There
were no artifacts, charcoal, or other associations.
Feature V. Feature V was a rock concentration in the north wall of
Pit I; it extended into the next square which was partially excavated
in order to expose the feature (see Figs. 3 and 4, A ) . It measured 2.8
feet long by 1.6 feet wide, and was 1.0 to 1.5 feet below the surface.
Feature VI. Feature VI was a small sandstone concentration in the
south wall of Pit E. Approximately 1.5 feet long, 1.0 foot wide, and
0.5 foot thick, it was in the upper part of the dark, sandy midden soil.
DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS

The 288 artifacts found at the Terri Site are all of stone. Included
are these classes: arrow points, dart points, knives, crude bifacials,
drills, gravers, spokeshaves, burins, scrapers, cores, choppers, hammerstones, and milling stones.

Arrow Points
Of the 34 arrow points and arrow point fragments found , 16 are
too fragmentary to permit accurate description. The other 18 comprise
four triangular, five subtriangular, and nine stemmed specimens.
Triangular Arrow Points. Three of the four triangular arrow points
(Fig. 6, A-C) are of the Harrell type (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 275, Pl.
138). They have straight blade edges, deep lateral notches above the
base, and straight ( 2 specimens) or concave ( 1 specimen) bases.
Length ranges from 21 to 27 mm.; width, 13 to 16 mm.; thickness,
2.5 to 3 mm. The fourth triangular arrow point (Fig. 6, D ) is unnotched and has a V -shaped, deeply indented base. This point, which
lacks its distal portion, is 20 mm. wide and 3 mm. thick.
Subtriangular Arrow Points. Two of the five subtriangular arrow
points (Fig. 6, E-F ) seem to be variants of the Young type (Suhm
and Jelks, 1962: 295, Pl. 148 ). Both have convex lateral edges, but
one (Fig. 6, E) has a convex base, the other an irregularly concave
base. These points have been worked primarily from one face, although the other face shows light retouche along the edges on both
specimens. The convex-based specimen measures 21 mm. long, 14
mm. wide, and 2.5 mm. thick; the other Young-like point is 25 mm.
long, 12 mm. wide, and 3 mm. thick.
Another of the subtriangular points (Fig. 6, I) has a convex-edged,
serrated blade, shallow lateral notches, and a straight, unmodified base.

TERRI AND LIGHTFOOT SITES

149

It has been ·worked from one face only. It is 14 mm. long, 9 mm. wide,
and 2 mm. thick.
The two remaining subtriangular points seem to be of the Granbury
type (Jelks, 1962: 35-36, Fig. 14, M-W). One (Fig. 6, G) is of the
bono variety (Ibid.: 35-36, Fig. 14, M-0) . Its lateral edges are mildly
convex and its base is straight. The workmanship is crude except for
fine retouche along the lateral and basal edges. Length is 24 mm.,
thickness 4 mm. As one corner of the base is lacking, the width cannot
be accurately determined. The other Granbury point (Fig. 6, H ), of
the joshua variety (Ibid. : 36, Fig. 14, P-T ), has straight lateral edges
and a convex base. One face of the blade has been worked, but only
around the edges. Lacking the distal tip, this specimen measures 20
mm. wide and 2 mm. thick.
Stemmed Arrow Points. The nine stemmed arrow points from the
Terri Site are classed in three groups: Scallorn ( 7) Cliffton ( 1), and
miscellaneous ( 1 ) .
The single Cliffton point (Fig. 6, J ), which lacks its tip and much
of its medial section, appears originally to have had straight blade
edges, relatively long barbs, and a rudimentary, pointed stem. It is
chipped bifacially. The only dimension that can be determined accurately is the thickness, which is 3.5 mm.
Two of the seven Scallorn points (Fig. 6, P, Q) seemingly belong
to the eddy variety (Jelks, 1962: 28-30, Fig. 13, M-R ). Their blades
have straight or concave edges, as well as prominent barbs. The stems
expand slightly and have straight to slightly convex bases. One specimen measures 35 mm. long by 1 7 mm. wide. The other is 20 mm.
wide, but its length cannot be ascertained. Both specimens are 3 mm.
thick.
The other five Scallorn points (Fig. 6, K-0 ) cannot be assigned
to any of the recognized varieties of the type. They all have straight
to convex blade edges, short barbs, expanding stems, and straight to
concave bases. Their length ranges from 14 to 32 mm. , width is 11 to
14 mm., and thickness is 2 to 4 mm.
The remaining stemmed arrow point (Fig. 6, R ) resembles Seallorn in some respects, but is too divergent for definite assignment to
that type. It has a wide, triangular blade with convex edges and short
barbs, and a wide, expanding stem (formed by deep corner notches)
with a convex base. It is 21 mm. long, 16 mm. wide, and 3 mm. thick.

Dart Points
The 11 dart points from the Terri Site are divided into five groups:

TERRI AND LIGHTFOOT SITES

151

unstemmed points, straight-stemmed points, points with slightly expanding stems, points with strongly expanding stems, and miscellaneous specimens.
Unstemmed Dart Points. One of the two unstemmed dart points
(Fig. 7, A ) is similar to the Plainview type (Suhm and Jelks, 1962:
239, Pl. 120). The blade is lanceolate in form , with the lateral edges
approximately parallel to each other. The base is concave and a long
thinning flake has been removed from each face . The basal edge and
the proximal portion of the lateral edges show evidence of grinding.
The workmanship is good, although the flake scars are generally not
parallel. Lacking the distal tip, the surviving portion measures 57 mm.
in length, 26 mm. in width, and 8 mm. in thickness . The main distinction between this point and classic Plainview points is its relatively great weight.
The second unstemmed point (Fig. 7, B) is of the Meserve type
(Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 217, Pl. 109) . The blade is lanceolate and is
beveled on the left edge of each face . The stem edges grade imperceptibly into the blade and are ground. The base is deeply indented, but
the usual long thinning flake scars of the Meserve type are absent.
Lacking much of the distal portion, this specimen measures 19 mm.
in width and 5 mm. in thickness. It is smaller and uf poorer workmanship than most Meserve points.
Parallel-Stemmed Dart Po:nts. The two parallel-stemmed dart
points (Fig. 7, C, D ) may be assigned to the Pedernales type (Suhm
and Jelks, 1962: 235- 237, Pls. 118, 119 ) . One specimen ( Fig. 7, C) is
too fragmentary to allow detailed description. The other specimen
(Fig. 7, D ) has a short stubby blade with straight edges . The shoulders
are squared, the stem edges are straight, and, although one corner is
missing, the base originally was deeply indented.
Dart Points With Slightly Expanding Stems. Two of the three points
assigned to this group are of the Marshall type (Suhm and Jelks,
1962: 211 , Pl. 106 ) . One (Fig. 7, E ) has convex, finely serrated blade
edges that are lightly beveled on the right edge of each face. The blade
is broad and has barbs extending downward, approximately paralleling the stem. The stem edges are nearly straight, but expand slightly
towar\ the base. The base is slightly concave, and the corners are rectangular. The base has been thinned by the removal of several long
flakes from each face . Lacking a small part of the distal tip, this specimen is 68 mm. long, 36 mm. wide, and 7 mm. thick.
Only the proximal portion of the second Marshall point (Fig. 7, F )
is present. The blade is broad with convex edges and exhibits slight

153

beveling on the right edge of each face. The stem has straight edges
that expand slightly toward the base. The base is concave and has
been thinned by the removal of several long flakes from each face . The
width of this specimen is 40 mm. and its thickness is 7 mm.
The third dart point with a slightly expanding stem (Fig. 7, G) does
not fit any recognized type. The blade edges are straight to slightly
convex, while the shoulders are squared. The stem edges are slightly
concave and flare out somewhat toward the base. The base is concave
and was thinned by short flakes removed from both faces . The distal
portion is lacking, and a small burin facet is present on one blade edge
adjacent to the transverse break. The width of the remaining portion
is 38 mm., and its thickness is 7 mm. The workmanship is excellent,
with occasional parallel flake scars.
Dart Points With Strongly Expanding Stems. Two of the three
specimens in this group (Fig. 7, H, I) are basal fragments-one of
them (Fig. 7, H) scarred by thermal fracture--which will not be
described in detail. The stem of the unscarred fragment (Fig. 7, I)
is markedly expanding, ar:d its base has been thinned on one face by
the removal of several long flakes.
The third specimen with a strongly expanding stem (Fig. 7, J) is
triangular in shape, with straight blade edges that are beveled to the
right on each face. The shoulders are weakly barbed and the neck of
the stem is wide. The stem edges are straight and expand rapidly toward the base; the shoulders are slightly wider than the base. The base
is irregular and has been thinned on only one face. Length is 40 mm.
(the tip is missing) ; width at the shoulders is 21 mm.; width of the
base is 20 mm.; maximum thickness is 7 mm.
Miscellaneous Dart Point. This dart point (Fig. 7, K ), fashioned
from a thin flake, is worked only along the right edge of each face.
The stem is irregular in shape. The blade edges are convex curving
somewhat at the tip and at one shoulder. The shoulders are fairly
prominent, and one of them exhibits a slight barb. The length of this
specimen is 48 mm., the width is 21 mm., and the thickness (at the
base) is 6 mm.

Drill
One distal fragment of a drill (Fig. 7, L) was found. The edges of
the bit are straight and taper to a sharp tip. The workmanship is
fairly good, the flake scars meeting in the center to create a medial
ridge on each face. Lacking the basal portion, this specimen measures
31 mm. long, 9 mm. wide, and 4 mm. thick.

Knives
The 10 knives from the Terri Site are divided into two groups: triangular (2 specimens) and subtriangular (8 specimens).
Triangular Knives. One of the two triangular knives (Fig. 8, A) is
a small implement with convex lateral edges and a convex base.
Pressure retouching is evident along the edges, but the general workmanship is poor. Width is 25 mm. and thickness is 6 mm. Since the
distal part is missing, the length cannot be measured.
The other triangular knife (Fig. 8, B) exhibits slightly convex blade
edges and a practically straight base. The workmanship is good on one
face but crude on the other. Both faces are faintly beveled on the right
edge, and the base has been thinned by the removal of several longitudinal flakes. The original length cannot be determined because the
distal end is lacking; however, the remaining portion is 23 mm. wide
and 5 mm. thick.
Subtriangular Knives. Four of the eight subtriangular knives (Fig.
8, C-E) are assigned to the Cleburne type (Jelks, 1962: 44, Fig. 18 ) .
The blade edges vary from slightly concave to convex, and the bases
are convex to straight. The workmanship is generally crude, although
occasional pressure retouching can be seen along the blade edges, and
two specimens show basal thinning. All the specimens lack their distal
tips, and consequently their original lengths cannot be accurately
determined. Width and thickness are very consistent: three are 29
mm. wide; the other is 30 mm. wide; all are 6 mm. thick.
Two of the untyped subtriangular knives (Fig. 8, F) are relatively
large forms with convex blade edges. Although workmanship is very
crude, there is occasional pressure flaking along the lateral edges and
the base. The length of the one complete specimen is 57 mm. , its width
is 38 mm., and its thickness 7.5 mm. The width of the other specimen
is 45 mm., its thickness is 11 mm.
Another of the untyped subtriangular knives ( Fig. 8, G) has essentially straight lateral edges and a convex base. The shoulders are indented slightly, forming a weak stem. The general workmanship is
crude, although some pressure flaking is evident along the blade edges
and portions of the stem. Lacking much of the distal portion, this specimen measures 25 mm. wide and 5 mm. thick.
The remaining subtriangular knife (Fig. 8, H) has one straight
blade edge, one strongly convex blade edge, and a convex base. The
workmanship is fairly good with pressure flake scars visible along
most of the lateral edges and along the base. This specimens is 39 mm.
long; 23 mm. wide; and 5.5 mm. thick.

Knife Fragments
Although too fragmentary for typological study, these 17 specimens
were probably similar to those described above.

Crude Bifacials
These two artifacts (Fig. 8, I, J) are similar to the knives, but seem
to be too crude and the edges too dull for effective use as cutting implements . Both specimens have irregular, convex lateral edges that
are sinuous and blunt. Neither specimen is complete but they appear
originally to have been long and narrow. One specimen is 30 mm.
wide and 15 mm. thick; the other is 32 mm. wide and 11 mm. thick.

Scrapers
The 119 scrapers are divided into seven groups: utilized flakes,
cortex flake scrapers, large flake scrapers, oval scrapers, small side
scrapers, spokeshaves, and plano-convex scrapers.
Utilized Flakes. A total of 89 utilized flakes (Fig. 9, A-C) comprise
the largest group of scrapers. These are flakes that seem to have been
used without modification for scraping purposes and then discarded.
Small pressure flake scars can be seen on one, or less commonly, on
two edges. The dimensions of the utilized flakes vary greatly, length
ranging from 13 to 82 mm. and the width from 10 to 47 mm.
Cortex Flake Scrapers. These 14 scrapers (Fig. 9, E, F ) were
fashioned from large flakes which retain much of the cortex (patina)
of the original nodules. Most of them show signs of heavy use on one
or, occasionally, on two edges. The outlines of these specimens are
very irregular and appear to reflect variations in the shape of the stone
nodules used. The length varies from 38 to 80 mm., the width from
25 to 53 mm. , and the thickness from 10 to 26 mm.
Large Flake Scrapers. One of these two large scrapers (Fig. 9, G )
has been worked around the edges and across part of one face . The
lateral edges are convex and converge to form a rounded tip. Since it
lacks one end, the original length of this specimen cannot be determined. The width is 63 mm., and the thickness is 20 mm. The other
large flake scraper (Fig. 9, H ) has irregular edges, two of which show
pressure flaking. The workmanship is extremely crude, due perhaps
to the nature of the chert. The length of this specimen is 50 mm., the
width 45 mm. , and the thickness 16 mm.

flake which was worked into a more or less oval shape. Pressure flaking
is evident around the entire circumference except at the bulb of percussion. The edges are convex save near the bulb of percussion, where
they are quite irregular. This specimen measures 51 mm. long, 33
mm. wide, and 10 mm. thick.
Small Side Scrapers. Seven of the nine small side scrapers (Fig. 9,
I-M) have convex scraping edges, while the other two have concave
scraping edges. Workmanship is fairly good. All are too fragmentary
to permit accurate measurement of length, but width varies from 20 to
25 mm. and thickness from 5 to 9 mm.
Spokeshaves. These two flakes (Fig. 8, L) have concavities that
seem suitable for dressing arrow shafts or other wooden objects. The
concavities on the two specimens are 13 and 18 mm. wide respectively.
Both show evidence of pressure flaking along their edges beyond the
spokeshave concavities.
Plano-Convex Scrapers. These two unusual specimens (Fig. 9, N)
are plano-convex in cross section and have been worked entirely over
the convex face. The lateral edges are essentially straight and show
evidence of heavy use. Unfortunately, both specimens are medial
fragments and their length cannot be accurately determined. The
width of one specimen is 24 mm. and its thickness is 11 mm.; width
of the other is 22 mm. , its thickness 11 mm.

Gravers
These three artifacts have tiny, beak-like projections which occur on
largely unmodified flakes (Fig. 8, K ). The projections range from 2
to 5 mm. in length.

Burins
Three burins (Fig. 8, M-0 ) (Epstein, 1963 : 70) were recovered
from the Terri Site. Specimen 1 (Fig. 8, M) was fashioned from a
fragmentary knife or dart point blade. The burin tip was resharpened
several times, as can be seen by the large number of flake scars. The
width of the burin tip is 5 mm., and the length of the flake scars,
which extend downward from the tip, ranges from 14 to 20 mm. A
second specimen (Fig. 8, N) is similar to the first, but does not show
as much evidence of use as the first. The width of the burin tip is 5
mm. and the flake scars range from 25 to 29 mm. in length. The third
specimen (Fig. 8, 0) has burin flake scars at two different loci. At
one locus, the burin tip is 6 mm. wide and the flake scars are 33 mm.

H ammerstones
These seven artifacts (Fig. 10, E, F ) are large cobbles of chert or
quartzite which bear evidence of battering. Some of them have fairly
large scars where flakes were apparently detached as a result of the
battering.

Choppers
Large bifacially worked implements with irregular, sinuous cutting edges are termed choppers (Fig. 10, C, D) . All13 choppers from
the Terri Site retain portions of the original cobble cortex at their
proximal ends. One specimen is of quartzite; the others are of chert.

Cores
Eighteen large, crude cobbles (Fig. 10, A, B) bear scars where several large flakes were removed from them, and thus they are classified as cores. These cores may have been used secondarily as tools,
but primarily they were a source of flakes.

Milling Stones
Fifty milling stones were recovered from the Terri Site, 38 grinding slabs and 12 manos. Both the manos and the slabs appear to have
been employed with a rotary grinding motion.
Manos. Five manos (Fig. 11, B) show signs of use on two surfaces,
while seven (Fig. 11 , A) were used on one face only. The majority
are relatively small, and they are generally unmodified except for use
wear. Since most specimens are fragmentary, their dimensions will
not be given. All12 specimens are of sandstone.
Grinding Slabs. All 38 of the grinding slabs are of sandstone, but
only two are complete. The grinding surfaces of some fragments seem
to be relatively flat although one of the complete specimens (Fig. 11 ,
C) has a pronounced bowl-shaped grinding area. The rest of the fragments and the other complete specimen exhibit a general gradation
between flat and deeply concave grinding surfaces.
DISTRIBUTION OF THE ARTIFACTS

Distributional analysis of artifacts at the Terri Site was begun by
plotting the frequency of each artifact category in areas A and B respectively. No significant distributional difference between the two
areas was noted. Next, the artifact groups were plotted by six-inch

certain kinds of artifacts were discernible, trends which can best be
shown by a tabulation of all artifacts by six-inch levels from the site
as a whole (Table 1) .

The major significant trends in vertical distribution are : ( 1) milling stones occur most commonly in relatively deep levels; (2 ) projectile points, knives, and scrapers tend to occur at relatively high
levels (in comparison to milling stones) ; (3) dart points occur gen-

erally deeper than arrow points. Some of the other artifact classes are
distributed in possibly meaningful vertical patterns (e.g., the two
spokeshaves are relatively deep and the one drill is relatively high ) ,
but samples are too small in most cases for significant interpretation.
The evidence suggests that the Terri Site was first occupied by a
culture that subsisted to a large extent by gathering seeds, roots, or
other vegetable foods which were ground on the numerous milling
stones found in the lower levels. Later occupants were oriented es-

sentially toward a hunting economy, as attested by the r elatively large
number of projectile points, knives, and scrapers in the upper levels.
Two periods of hunting culture occupancy are equated respectively
with the dart points and the arrow points.
THE LIGHTFOOT SITE

The Lightfoot Site ( 41 CJ 23) is situated near several perennial
springs on the slopes of a small hill at the western edge of the Leon
River flood plain. Surface indications of occupation-mussel shells,
bone fragments, flint flakes, and other debris-are spread over an area
of som e two acres, the greatest concentration being at the western edge
of the site. Prior to excavation, part of the site had been damaged by
the con struction of a stock pond, and cultivation had disturbed the
upper few inches of another part; nevertheless, much of th e cultural
deposits were completely undisturbed. Unlike most sites in the Proctor area, there had been little observable damage by erosion. Since
the site seemed rich in artifacts and appeared to have substantial
depth, excavations designed to salvage a representative sample of artifacts and other data were carried out there in late June and early
July, 1963 .
Three different areas-designated as areas A, B, and C respectively
- were tested as indicated in Figure 12. In Area A (west of the stock
pond in a wooded area ) 12 five-foot squares were excavated to a maximum depth of 2.5 feet below the surface. In Area B (east of the stock
pond ) four five-foot squares were dug to a depth of 2.5 feet. About 65
feet northeast of the Area B test, in Area C, a single five-foot square
was dug to a depth of 4.5 feet.
All squares were dug by arbitrary half-foot vertical intervals, and
all excavated soil was passed through screens of quarter-inch mesh.
The uppermost stratum in Area A was a gray -brown soil, averaging a bout 8 inches thick, much of which had been disturbed by plowing. Mussel shells, bone fragments, and flint debris were scattered
throughout. This stratum gave way to a lighter-colored soil of grayish
hue which contained cultural debris similar to that in the overlying
stratum. At approximately two feet below the surface the gray soil
changed gradually to a sterile clay in the northern portion of the excavation and into sterile sand in the southern portion. The clay and
sand continued downward to the maximum (2.5 feet) depth of the
excavation pits.
In Area B, the upper soil stratum consisted of unplowed dark,

humus-stained soil containing a large quantity of small, pea-sized
gravel. At a depth of 10 to 12 inches this stratum changed abruptly
to a compact clay and gravel deposit which extended downward to
the maximum (2.5 feet ) depth of the excavation. Most of the cultural
debris was concentrated in the upper stratum, but a few flint flakes
were found as deep as two feet below th e surface.

TERRI AND LIGHTFOOT SITES

167

The uppermost stratum of Area C was a grayish-tan, humusstained soil about 6 inches thick, with admixture of sand and small
gravel. Below that lay a stratum of gray sand mixed with pea-sized
gravel which extended to a depth of 3 feet below the surface, at which
level the soil started to become more and more clayey until, at 3.5
feet, a formation composed entirely of compact, gravelly clay was
reached. The latter formation extended down to the maximum ( 4.5
feet ) depth of excavation. Artifacts were found in all levels excavated
at Area C, but the quantity decreased from the higher to the lower
levels.
DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS

The artifacts recovered from the Lightfoot Site are (with one exception, a bone awl) made of stone. Included are the following
classes : arrow points, dart points, drills, knives, crude bifacials, scrapers, gravers, burins, burin spalls, hammerstones, choppers, cores, and
milling stones.

Arrow Points
Altogether 106 arrow points and arrow point fragments were recovered from the Lightfoot Site; however, 33 of them are too incomplete for accurate typological identification. Of the more complete
specimens, seven are triangular in over-all outline, seven are subtriangular, and the remaining 59 are stemmed.
Triangular Arrow Points. The seven triangular arrow points show
considerable variation. Five (Fig. 13, J-N ) are small, bifacially
worked points, probably of the Fresno type ( Suhm and Jelks, 1962:
273, Pl. 137 ) . Their edges vary from straight to convex, while the
bases are straight or slightly concave. Length varies from 20 to 31
mm.; width (at the base) is 12 to 16 mm.; thickness is 2 to 5 mm.
The two other triangular arrow points are of the Harrell type
(Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 275, Pl. 138 ). They have prominent side
notches above the base, lateral edges are straight, and bases are
slightly concave. The most complete specimen (Fig. 13, I) measures
26 mm. in length, 14 mm. in width (at the base), and 3 mm. in thickness. A less complete specimen (Fig. 13, H) is 16 mm. wide and 3 mm.
thick (at the base).
Subtriangular Arrow Points. Seven arrow points are subtriangular
in outline, with convex edges and bases. Three of them (Fig. 14, L-N )
were made from thin, curved (plano-convex or concavo-convex) flakes

168

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

with little modification on the concave or plane face. Faint pressure
flaking, however, can be observed on the edges of both faces. Length
ranges from 24 to 40 mm., width from 17 to 21 mm., and thickness
from 3 to 5 mm. These specimens seem to conform to the description of the Young arrow point type (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 295, Pl.
135; Jelks, 1962: 35, Fig. 14, K-L) .
Three of the subtriangular points (Fig. 14, J, K ) are carefully
flaked examples of Granbury joshua (Jelks, 1962: 35, Fig. 14, P-T ).
Lacking the distal tips, these points range in width from 21 to 24 mm.
and in thickness from 3 to 4.5 mm.
The remaining subtriangular arrow point (Fig. 14, I) is a thin,
carefully flaked example of the Granbury parker type (Jelks, 1962:
35, Fig. 14, V-W ) . This specimen is 30 mm. long and 4 mm. thick; its
maximum width cannot be measured because one corner of the base is
lacking.
Stemmed Arrow Points. A great deal of variety is exhibited by the
stemmed arrow points, which range from specimens with short,
pointed stems, to specimens with long, straight, contracting stems and
others with expanding stems.
A total _of 21 arrow points (Fig. 13, 0-U ) have small, broad, contracting stems and roughly triangular blades with concave, convex,
and (more commonly) straight edges. These belong to the Cliffton
type ( Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 269, Pl. 135; Jelks, 1962: 26, Fig. 12,
M -Q ) . These specimens are crudely chipped, and four are modified
on only one face . Length ranges from 27 to 38 mm. , width from 16 to
26 mm. , and thickness from 3 to 6 mm.
Fourteen arrow points are assigned to the Perdiz type (Suhm and
Jelks, 1962: 283, Pl. 142). Of these, six (Fig. 13, C, D ) appear to be
of the whitney variety (Jelks, 1962: 24-25 , Fig. 12, A-F), three (Fig.
13, A. B) are of the morgan variety (Ibid.: 26, Fig. 12, G-I ), and five
( Fig. 13, E-G) are miscellaneous Perdiz points. The Perdiz whitney
points exhibit straight to slightly convex blade edges, prominent to
weak barbs, and relatively broad stems with straight to mildly convex
edges. The bases of the stems are rounded. The only complete specimen
is 31 mm. long; width ranges from 13 to 20 mm.; all three specimens
are 3 mm. thick. Five miscellaneous Perdiz points, which cannot
readily be assigned to any recognized variety, have unusually small
stems. These specimens range in length from 23 to 24 mm., in width
from 19 to 22 mm. , and in thickness from 2 to 3 mm.
Six of the stemmed arrow points belong to the Scallorn type ( Suhm
and Jelks, 1962: 285, Pl. 143). Their blades are triangular with ap-

proximately straight edges, and short to relatively long barbs are
present. Two of these with long, very slightly expanding stems (Fig.
13, V) may be assigned to the eddy variety (Jelks, 1962: 28-30,
Fig. 13, M -R ). Three others (Fig. 13, W-Y) have strongly expanding stems, slightly convex bases, and slight barbs-hallmarks of the
sattler variety (Ibid. : 30-31, Fig. 13, S-U). The remaining Scallorn
point (Fig. 13, Z) can be assigned to no recognized variety. It has
a strongly expanding stem made by deep corner notches and a weakly
concave base. As a group, the Scallorn points from the Lightfoot Site
vary in length from 23 to 38 mm. , in width from 11 to 21 mm. , and
in thickness from 3 to 3.5 mm.
Two unusual fragmentary specimens, (Fig. 13, AA, BB ) , unidentified as to type, exhibit long expanding stems produced by shallow
lateral concavities. The shoulders are rounded and indistinct. Width
at the base measures 11 and 12 mm. respectively, thickness 4 and 3.5
mm. Lengths cannot be ascertained as the distal portions of both
specrmens are m1ss1ng.
The remaining 16 stemmed arrow points (Fig. 14, A-H ) are not
assigned to specific types even though they resemble generally several
recognized types including Alba, Bonham, and Perdiz. There is a
gradation in the group from specimens with rectangular stems to
others with slightly contracting, slightly expanding, or bulbous stems.
Their blades are triangular, with straight, concave, or recurved edges
and moderate to pronounced barbs. Length varies between 21 and
41 mm.; width is 13 to 23 mm.; thickness is 2 to 4 mm. Although the
specimens in this group are, in general, rather similar to one another,
it would be unwise and, indeed, arbitrary to attempt a typological
segregation of such a small sample.

Dart Points
The 17 dart points from the Lightfoot Site are distinguished from
the arrow points primarily on the basis of their larger size. They are
divided into five groups: unstemmed, parallel-stemmed, slightly expanding stem, strongly expanding stem, and miscellaneous.
Unstemmed Dart Point. The single unstemmed point (Fig. 15, A)
seems to fit the Abasolo type ( Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 165, Pl. 83). The
blade edges are slightly convex, as in the base. The left face of each
side is beveled, and the base is thinned. The specimen is 47 mm. in
length, 26 mm. in width, and 7 mm. in thickness. The workmanship
is fairly good.

Parallel-Stemmed Dart Points. Of the two fragmentary parallelstemmed points (Fig. 15, B, C), one (Fig. 15, B) seems to be of the
Pedernales type ( Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 235-23 7, Pls. 118, 119 ). It
has the characteristic deeply concave base of Pedernales, the shoulders
are weak, and the stem has been thinned by the removal of a single,

172

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

long flake . One corner of the base is missing, but the fragment is still
identifiable.
The other fra gment has one weakly developed shoulder and one
well developed shoulder set at right angles to the long axis of the point.
One corner of the base is absent, but it seems originally to have been
straight or slightly concave. Several small longitudinal flakes have
been removed from the base.
Dart Points With Slightly Expanding Stems. Two of the eight dart
points with slightly expanding stems are of the Darl type ( Suhm and
Jelks, 1962: 179, Pl. 90). The blades are slender and roughly triangular. On one specimen (Fig. 15, D) the right edges on both faces
are steeply beveled; the blade edges of the other specimen are beveled
to the left on both faces , but not steeply. The stems expand slightly
toward the base and are beveled: one specimen (Fig. 15, E ) to the
left on both faces, the other on both edges of one face only. The
shoulders are weak, the stem edges are straight, and the bases are indented somewhat by the removal of several longitudinal flakes . The
stem edges of both specimens and the base of one (Fig. 15, D ) are
ground. One specimen that is missing its distal portion is 18 mm.
wide at the shoulders and 5 mm. thick. The other is 38 mm. long, 1 7
mm. wide at the shoulders, and 7 mm. thick. Base widths are 18 and
17 mm. respectively.
The remaining six dart points with slightly expanding stems (Fig.
15, F-K) are classified in a single descriptive group even though
three of them consist only of blade fragments. The group is characterized by long, slender blades that are alternatively beveled to either
the right or the left. The blade edges are generally straight but may
be slightly convex or slightly concave. The shoulders are well developed and occasionally have short, lateral barbs (Fig. 15, F, K) .
The stems expand moderately, and their edges tend to be straight or
nearly so. The bases vary from mildly convex to mildly concave.
Stem necks are relatively wide, and the stem edges of two specimens
have been smoothed. The two measurable specimens are respectively
60 and 64 mm. long; width at the shoulders is 21 to 29 mm.; thickness
is 7 to 8 mm. Stems are 11 to 13 mm. long and bases are 14 to 19 mm.
wide.
Dart Points With Strongly Expanding Stems. One of the points in
this group (Fig. 15, L) has a triangular blade with mildly convex
edges and well developed shoulders. The stem expands strongly, and
there is broad notch in the center of the base. The basal corners are

TERRI AND LIGHTFOOT SITES

173

rounded. Over-all length is 43 mm., width is 23 mm., and thickness
is 8mm.
One of the expanding stem dart points (Fig. 15, M ) is assigned to
the Martindale type (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 213, Pl. 107 ) . The blade
is triangular with convex edges and has strong barbs at the shoulders.
The stem edges are straight, and the base is recurved in the characteristic Martindale manner. The stem has been thinned by the removal
of several small flake s. This specimen is 3 7 mm. long, 30 mm. wide,
and 7 mm. thick.
Another specimen (Fig. 15, N ) has a triangular blade with straight
edges and barbed shoulders. The stem expands very strongly so that
the base-which is approximately straight-is almost as wide as the
shoulders. This specimen is 36 mm. long (lacking the distal tip ) , 20
mm. wide, and 6.5 mm. thick. The base is 18 mm. wide.
The fourth dart point of this category (Fig. 15, 0 ) has a short triangular blade that seems to have been resharpened. The resharpening
produced steep beveling along the blade edges and created a barb on
one side. The blade edges are irregular, perhaps owing to the resharpening operation. The expanding stem has been thinned by the removal
of several small flakes , and the base is slightly convex. This specimen
is 32 mm. long, 24 mm. wide, and 6 mm. thick.
Miscellaneous Dart Points. One of the miscellaneous dart points
consists of a fragment, possibly the lower portion of the stem from a
Pedernales point. The edges are straight, and the base is indented by
the removal of several small flakes. This specimen is 16 mm. wide and
6 mm. thick.
The other miscellaneous dart point is too badly scarred by thermal
fracture to permit meaningful description.

Drills
One of the three drills (Fig. 14, 0) has recurved lateral edges and a
roughly rectangular base. The bit edges have been beveled in such a
manner as to form a medial ridge on each face . The length of the drill
(which is lacking the tip) is 50 mm., maximum width of the bit is 10
mm., thickness is 5 mm., and the width of the base is 11 mm.
Another of the drill specimens (Fig. 14, P) consists of a slender bit
fragment. It tapers gently to a sharp point, the edges being mildly convex, and one face of the bit exhibits a slight medial ridge where the
flake scars meet.

much like th e specimen illustrated in Figure 15, K. The dart point has

TERRI AND LIGHTFOOT SITES

175

been worked down into a small bit that is difficult to measure since it
merges gradually with the blade of the point.

Knives
Relatively thin, unstemmed, bifacially-worked implements that
have sharp edges suitable for cutting purposes are, somewhat arbitrarily, classified as knives . Relatively crude bifacials that resemble knives,
but which are thicker and have more sinuous edges, are here classed
as crude bifacials since they seem unsuitable for use as knives. Of the
56 knives, 33 are too fragmentary to classify into descriptive groups.
Triangular Knives. Of the three triangular knives, one (Fig. 16, C)
exhibits somewhat finer workmanship than the other two (Fig. 16, A,
B) which are crudely chipped by the percussion technique. The blade
edges of this group are straight to convex; the bases are convex
( 1 specimen) to irregular ( 2 specimens) . One specimen lacks the
distal tip and another has been broken along one edge of the blade. The
three specimens range in length from 45 to 61 mm. ; width at or near
the base is from 30 to 35 mm.; thickness is 7 to 12 mm.
Subtriangular Knives. There are 9 specimens in this group. One of
them (Fig. 16, F) has convex blade edges and a convex base, the base
retaining a patch of nodular cortex. The chipping is very crude, and
there is pressure retouching (or possibly use scarring) along the blade
edges. The length of this specimen is 40 mm. , its width 29 mm., and
its thickness 8 mm.
Two of the subtriangular knives (Fig. 16, D, E) might be described
as roughly crescent shaped. One blade edge of each is convex while the
other is slightly concave. The base of one (Fig. 16, D ) is pointed while
the other (Fig. 16, E ) is convex. The length of the former is 50 mm.,
its width 29 mm. , and its thickness 13 mm. The latter is 56 mm. long,
29 mm. wide, and 11 mm. thick.
Six of the subtriangular knives (Fig. 17, A-F ) are assigned to the
Cleburne type (Jelks, 1962: 44, Fig. 18 ) . The length of the only complete specimen (Fig. 17, A ) is 54 mm. Within the entire group, width
ranges from 26 to 32 mm. and thickness from 5 to 9.5 mm. Blade edges
are straight to convex, and bases are convex. General workmanship
tends to be crude, but there is some pressure retouching (or use scarring ) along the lateral edges and, occasionally, on the base.
Rectangular Knives. Two fragmentary specimens (Fig. 16, G, H )
have more or less rectangular outlines. Their blade edges are straight
to slightly convex; the base of one specimen (Fig. 16, G) 1s concave,

176

while that of the other is convex. The width of the former is 29 mm. ,
its thickness 4 mm. The other is 22 mm. wide and 5 mm. thick. The
workmanship on both specimens is good. Fine pressure retouching
along the lateral edges tends to produce light beveling of the edges.
These resemble somewhat the Friday type of Jelks (1962: 42, Fig. 17,
A-C ).
Resharpened Knife Fragment. This fragment (Fig. 16, I) consists
of the distal end of a knife that has been resharpened, from one face
only, along the broken proximal edge. The lateral edges have also been
resharpened from the same face, and, in addition, occasional flakes
were removed from the other face. This specimen is 46 mm. long, 27
mm. wide, and 8 mm. thick.
Miscellaneous Knives. These eight specimens (Fig. 17, G, H) are
more or less oval in outline, the blade edges being generally convex
with occasional irregularities. Maximum length ranges from 25 to 48
mm., width from 21 to 35 mm., and thickness from 3 to 13 mm. The
workmanship is fairly crude, although there is pressure flaking around
the blade edges.

Knife and Dart Point Fragments
Thirty-three bifacially worked specimens are too fragmentary to
classify. They include distal, medial, and basal fragments of dart
points and/ or knives.

Crude Bifacials
This category includes two crudely chipped bifacial implements.
One (Fig. 18, I) consists of a distal fragment with a gently rounded tip.
The blade edges are slightly convex. Although workmanship is crude,
the edges appear to have been resharpened by pressure flaking. Patches
of the original cortex are visible on the tip. This specimen is 42 mm.
wide and 15 mm. thick.
The other crude bifacial (not illustrated) is roughly triangular in
outline with mildly convex lateral edges and a convex base. There is
no evidence of pressure resharpening. Patches of the original cortex
are visible on both lateral edges and on the base. This specimen is 64
mm. long, 44 mm. wide, and 19 mm. thick.

sified as scrapers. They are divided into six groups: snub-nose end
scrapers, utilized flakes , side scrapers, spokeshaves, oval scrapers, and
miscellaneous scrapers (including unclassifiable fragments ).
Utilized Flakes. This, the largest group of scrapers, numbers 65
specimens (Figs. 17, K, L; 18, J-L). They are fairly small to mediumsized, sharp-edged flakes that seem to have been used without modification for scraping purposes. Fine flaking along the edges evidently is
largely a result of pressure applied during u se (Jelks, 1962: 51). The
scraping edges, which range from concave to convex, often are slightly
beveled as a result of use. The dimensions are : length, 22 to 61 mm. ;
width, 8 to 41 mm.
Snub-nose End Scrapers. These two implements (Fig. 17, I, J ) are
elongated flakes with a convex, unifacial, steeply beveled scraping edge
at one end. The flake tapers in two dimensions so that the working
(distal ) end is considerably wider and thicker than the proximal end.
The upper face is markedly round at the distal end, and the lateral
edges are slightly convex to concave. One specimen (Fig. 17, I ) is 34
mm. long, 20 mm. wide, and 6 mm. thick. The other is 59 mm. long,
36 mm. wide, and 18 mm. thick.
Side Scrapers. These seven implements (Fig. 18, A, B) were made
by unifacially chipping one or more lateral edges of large cortex flakes.
Six specimens have scraping edges that are convex, while one has a
concave scraping edge. These implements range from 37 to 76 mm.
long, from 30 to 56 mm. wide, and from 8 to 16 mm. thick.
Spokeshaves. Each of these eight implements (Fig. 18, E, F ) has a
concavity in one edge that seems suitable for dressing arrow shafts or
other wooden objects . The concavity was formed by detaching a large
percussion flake from a suitable (usually cortex ) flake . Pressure applied during use apparently removed small flakes from the scraping
edge. Workmanship is crude, with pressure flaking evident only on
the spokeshave bits and occasionally along convex edges that also were
probably used for scraping. Length of the spokeshave bits ranges from
11 to 17 mm.; maximum length of the complete implements ranges
from 35 to 56 mm. , width from 21 to 43 mm. , and thickness from 10
to22mm.
Oval Scrapers . The four specimens in this group (Fig. 17, M-P ) are
roughly oval-shaped, thin flakes that have been worked over one entire
face . Heavy use has produced steep beveling around the edges. Length
is 24 to 31 mm., width 18 to 28 mm., and thickness 4 to 6 mm.
Miscellaneous Scrapers and Scraper Fragments. These 16 scrapers
(Fig. 18, C, D ) are either too fragmentary to be classified or too irregu-

lar to be included in any of the above categories . Some specimens are
steeply beveled on one face, while others show signs of only light use.

Gravers
There are two distinct groups of gravers. The first group ( 7 specimens; Fig. 18, G) consists of small beak-like projections on crude
flakes that are generally unmodified otherwise except that occasionally
additional scraping edges may be present. The beaks are 2 to 4 mm.
long.
The three specimens comprising the second group of gravers (Fig.
18, H) have longer beaks than those of the first group. They are made
from thin flakes that have no modifications other than the graver
beaks. The beaks range from 9 to 15 mm. in length; length of the complete implements varies from 25 to 33 mm. , width from 18 to 27 mm. ,
and thickness from 4 to 7 mm.

Burins and Burin Spalls
A bifacially worked implement (Fig. 18, P) which has had two long
flakes removed from its long axis is identified as an angle burin (Epstein, 1963: 70) . One spall scar is 54 mm. long by 10 mm. wide. The
other spall scar is 27 mm. long by 13 mm. wide. The width of the
burin tip is 8 mm.
Two burin spalls were found (Fig. 18, N, 0). They measure 31 and
42 mm. in length by 9 and 10 mm. in width, respectively. Both spalls
seem to have been struck from heavily-used burins.

H ammerstones
Six cobbles (Fig. 19, C, D) exhibit evidence of battering along the
edges and therefore are classified as hammerstones. Three are of chert
and three are of quartzite. Two of them are unmodified except for
use wear; the other four have had large flakes removed so as to form
angular edges, and the signs of battering are along these edges.

Choppers
Twenty-nine of the thirty choppers (Fig. 19, A, B) are made of
chert; the other one is of quartzite. These implements were made by
removing large flakes from cobbles in such a manner as to form sinuous cutting edges. They are generally bifacially worked but usually
retain much of the original cortex of the cobbles.

Cores
These 48 specimens all appear to have served as sources of large
flakes that presumably were desired for working into tools. Some of
the cores themselves seem also to have been used secondarily as tools.

Milling Stones
Of the 43 milling stones from the Lightfoot Site, ZO are manos and
Z3 are grinding slabs. All are made of sandstone, and some show evidence of having been burned.
Manos . All but six of the twenty manos are fragmentary . Ten of
them (Fig. 19, E ) have been used on two sides, the other ten (Fig. 19,
F) on one side only.
Grinding Slabs. All Z3 of the grinding slabs are fragmentary. The
surviving portions indicate that the grinding surfaces varied from flat
to concave, perhaps depending on the intensity or duration of use.

Bone Awl
The one bone awl recovered from the Lightfoot Site (Fig. 18, M) is
fashioned from a long bone of a mammal and retains part of an articular surface at the basal end. The body is polished, apparently from use,
and is oval in cross section. Lacking the distal tip, this specimen is 108
mm. long.
U NWORKED

BoNE AND SHELL

The bone residue from the Lightfoot Site is largely the remains of
bison, deer, and terrapin. A few small mammal bones were recovered,
but they are too fragmentary to be identified. Mussel shell was present
in some abundance.
DISTRIBUTION OF THE ARTIFACTS

The distributional analysis of artifacts at the Lightfoot Site was
carried out in much the same manner as at the Terri Site. The artifacts
were plotted on a graph by the different areas of the site (this is, areas
A, B, and C; see Fig. 1Z ) and by levels of individual five-foot squares
within the respective areas. The samples were too small to permit significant comparisons between areas, although it might be noted that
the vertical distribution of artifacts in areas A, B, and C followed the
same general pattern.

acterized by milling stones and (2) a late occupation marked by a
relative abundance of projectile points, scrapers, and knives (see
Table 2). The other classes of artifacts appear to have been more or
less evenly shared by the two occupations.
The artifact distribution pattern at the Lightfoot Site compares favorably with that of the Terri Site. The evidence indicates the same
general sequence at both sites: earlier occupation by gatherers, later
occupation by hunters.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

From the preceding descriptions and analyses we may draw certain
limited conclusions regarding the cultural prehistory of the Terri and
Lightfoot sites.
At both sites, milling stones were generally found stratigraphically
lower than projectile points . Physical mixing and the shallowness of
the cultural remains prevented clean stratigraphic separation of dart
points and arrow points and make it necessary to lump them under
one general heading. In short, two major periods of occupation are recognizable: a milling stone occupation and a projectile point occupation.
The earlier occupation, characterized by an abundance of milling
stones, may have been a seasonal habitation of the site by a culture
oriented toward gathering. Roots, nuts, berries, and other edible vegetal foods that are readily available in the locality today were probably
dietary staples of these earlier occupants. In addition, small game was
probably hunted, although almost no projectile points occur in the
deeper levels of either site. No attempt will be made to assign this component to any formal classificatory unit.
The second major occupation is characterized by the presence of
projectile points in relatively large numbers. This suggests an important change in the local economic pattern from a predominantly
gathering mode of existence to one based primarily on hunting. The
few bison and deer bones preserved in the upper levels of the Lightfoot
Site attest to this. Also, milling stones are relatively rare in those same
levels.
Three previously defined cultural units appear to be represented in
the material remains of the Terri and Lightfoot sites, although they
are not stratigraphically separable from one another at either site.
These units are identified by the presence of certain projectile point
types that-on the basis of data from other sites-are considered diagnostic of the respective culture units.

The Archaic Edwards Plateau Aspect, as defined by Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks ( 1954: 102-112 ) , is weakly represented at both sites by a
few Pedernales, Marshall, Martindale, and Darl dart points. The NeoAmerican Central Texas Aspect, as defined by Jelks ( 1962: 84-99 ), is
strongly represented, by Cliffton, Scallorn, and Granbury arrow points
at both sites and by Perdiz arrow points at the Lightfoot Site. The Henrietta Focus, as defined by Krieger (1946: 121-142), is lightly represented by Harrell, Fresno, and Young arrow points.
