ABSTRACT
On the 6th of March 2014 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resource management survey of the proposed 0.2 hectare (0.5 acre)
water well location and 262 meters (860 feet) of raw water pipeline right-of-way in
Hemphill, Texas. The pedestrian survey was conducted with a combination of visual
examination and shovel testing. The visual examination found the water well location
was highly disturbed; the area was cut/filled between 1996 and 2008, and was used for
various activities to include piling rubble along the north and west sides. The proposed
pipeline will parallel an existing gravel road to an existing water tank. Shovel testing of
both the well area and the pipeline right-of-way were negative. No artifacts were
recovered in the 11 shovel tests excavated in the project area or during the surface
inspection; therefore, no artifacts were curated. No State Antiquities Landmarks will be
affected by the proposed construction. No further investigations are recommended;
however, if any cultural material is recovered during construction, then excavation should
stop and DETAC contacted to evaluate the impact. DETAC is requesting concurrence
with the determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed
project area.

INTRODUCTION
In March 2014, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey of the City of Hemphill, Water System
Improvements (Contract #713219) in Hemphill, Texas (Figure 1). Proposed construction
includes utilizing an existing cleared and leveled area for the well site and a water line
right-of-way adjacent to an improved gravel road.

The archaeological survey was

conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #6809.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. No cultural resources were found during
the surface inspection shovel testing of the project area; therefore, no artifacts were
curated. The pedestrian survey did find the well pad area was heavily impacted by past
uses and the pipeline route will be adjacent to existing utility lines. No State Antiquities
Landmarks will be affected by the proposed construction. The report was prepared
following the short report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA)
(2005a) with modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999). DETAC requests
concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project included construction of a water well and a raw water pipeline to an
existing water tank. The water well pad will be approximately 30 meters (m) (100 feet
(ft)) square or 0.1 hectares (ha.) (0.2 acres (ac.)). The raw water pipeline will be in a
right-of-way approximately 262 m (860 ft) long. The total project area is roughly 0.2 ha.
(0.5 ac.). Topographically, the well location will be on the shoulder of an upland ridge.
The raw water pipeline will extend west from the well pad across the head of an upland
drainage to the existing water tank. The well location was cleared of vegetation while
vegetation along the pipeline was young soft and hard wood trees with a dense understory
of various bushes and shrubs. Ground cover includes leaf litter in areas with trees and
grasses along utility line.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Sabine County has been studied in numerous linear and area surveys. Most of the
investigations were for the Sabine National Forest (e.g., Davis 1993), roads or pipelines
(e.g., Moore 2004) and other industrial developments (e.g., Galan 2009). Other work was
performed for the Corps of Engineers or the Sabine River Authority around Toledo Bend
Reservoir.

These surveys generally show that sites were found adjacent to stream

channels in the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The
documents of primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990)
discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally, the THC, Department of Antiquities
Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407) describes the
Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area between the Red
River in the north, the Trinity River in the west and the Angelina River in the south.
This overview synthesizes the most recent significant research in the area.
The occupation of the area includes the Paleo-Indian (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) ,
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), the Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200
B.C. - A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680) and the Historic
Period (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian period (ca. 10,000-7000
B.C.) is characterized by small mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a
variety of plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic (7000-200 B.C.) refers to
hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized approaches toward
exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800)
stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing utilization of the
environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens, more prolonged
occupations at specific locales - indicating a more sedentary settlement- and the
emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of northeast
Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D. 8001600).

This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the

Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).

3

Larger

aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial
areas. Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds. A stratified
social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by
Service (1962, 1975).

Extensive commercial networks were also established.

The

Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the current cultural
setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations’ domination of the
area to the European immigrants’ establishment of farms, towns and counties. By 1845,
the region experienced Spanish and French exploration between the early 16th and late
18th centuries, colonialism, the intrusion by Americans and the establishment and
development of the state of Texas. Most early settlement was along the northern edge of
the county along the El Camino Real, e.g., Milam and ferries across the Sabine River
(Nail 2010). Logging was a predominant factor in the development of the area from the
early 19th century with the greatest expansion between 1876 and 1917 (Ippolito et al.
1999: 14-16). Hemphill became the Sabine County seat in 1858. The town was laid out
and named in honor of John Hemphill a Texas Judge and Senator (Cuter 2010). The
town remained relatively isolated from major commerce as most goods were sent down
the Sabine River or along Highway 96 in the southern portion of the county. It was not
until 1912 when the Lufkin, Hemphill, and Gulf Railway connected the town to other
population centers with more than roads (Harper 2010). The expansion of the railroad for
transporting supplies to and logs from mill towns and camps began as early as 1893 in the
area of the Sabine National Forest, but it was not until 1913 that the Pickering Lumber
Company begin operations in Shelby, Sabine and San Augustine Counties (Ippolito et al.
1999:17). The Pickering Lumber Company built over 16,000 km (10,000 mi) of trams in
Shelby and Sabine Counties.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities
Code following survey standards described by the Texas Historic Commission (2014)
and report guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). All fieldwork and reporting comply
with the ethics standards of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists. No State Antiquities Landmarks will be affected by the
proposed construction.
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National
Park Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) for determining eligibility of a cultural resource
to the NRHP. The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. If sites were found, then the investigations were
to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2014). The atlas contains a current
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location
maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records show State Archaeological
Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites.
DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. The pedestrian
survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination of the project area to locate sites.
Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter
in 10 cm (4 inch (in)) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 in). According to the
THC guidelines, the 0.1 ha. (0.2 ac.) for the well pad area required a minimum of two
shovel tests per acre while the pipeline required a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile.
Following these guidelines, the pedestrian survey included a surface inspection focused on
areas with exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds) along with a minimum of
six shovel tests. Shovel test locations were recorded with Ashtech GPS units with submeter post-processing accuracy. Notes were made about soil color, texture, and shovel test
depth.

RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2014) found the only documented archaeological surveys within 1.6 kilometers (km) (1
mile (mi)) of the project area include a survey for two portions of Compartment 87 which
were surveyed by the U.S. Forest Service in 1987. The surveyed areas are roughly 1.1
km (0.7 mi) southeast and 1.5 km (0.9 mi) southwest of the project area. Neither survey
documented any sites. No archaeological sites were documented within one mile of the
project area.
There are three historical markers within one mile of the project area. The closest
is for the Hemphill first Methodist church founded 1858 roughly 0.25 km (0.15 mi)
northwest of the project area near the center of Hemphill. The next closest marker is at
the Hemphill Cemetery roughly 0.5 km (0.3 mi) southwest of the project area. The
marker commemorates the graves of the early settlers in Hemphill. The oldest grave is
from 1867. The final marker is for the Macedonia Baptist Church cemetery established
in 1855 roughly 1.5 km (0.9 mi) northeast of the project area. Finally, the Request for
SHPO Consolation (Future Link 2014) states that the Pratt house moved on site in 2008.
The house burned down in July 2010 while under renovation by the County Historical
Foundation. The debris was moved prior to the current investigations.
The general environment of the project area is disturbed by modern activity across
the landscape. Soils across the project area are described as Moswell loam (MsB) on the
summit and Sawlit fine sandy loam (SeB) on the shoulder and backslope of the ridge
(NRCS 2014). Moswell loam consist of 15 cm (5 in) of grayish brown loam over red
clay. Sawlit fine sandy loam consists of up to 22 cm (9 in) of brown loam over clay
loam. Vegetation is mostly planted pine trees less than 20 years old or pasture grasses.
Several buried utilities were observed alongside modern disturbances for roads and
ground leveling activity described at the well location and along the pipeline below.

Well Site
The proposed well site encompasses a 30 m (100 ft) square area centered on the
water well location. Construction will include a gravel access road, a drilling rig, and a
well head. The well site and access road are in the leveled cut/fill area on the shoulder of

6

an upland ridge overlooking the headwaters of an unnamed stream to the east. Vegetation
in the cut/fill area was removed prior to the archaeological survey. Vegetation on the
slopes was limited to a small stand of young pine trees and pasture grasses.
The soils were highly disturbed ad the area was cut/filled between 1996 when the
area was a cleared pasture and 2005 when the cut/fill is obvious and a house is visible at
the well location. The house is visible on the 2009 air photo but is a burned area in the
2012 air photos (Google Earth 2014 and TNRIS 2014).
The pedestrian survey found the well area heavily disturbed. The artificially level
area was cleared of all vegetation (Figure 2). Surface inspection found scattered building
materials but no intact features. Several push piles, obvious on Google Earth imagery
beginning in 2005 were noted along the north and west sides of the level area. Observed
materials included several varieties of brick, reinforced cement blocks, and scattered
wood. The bricks most likely represent several episodes of deposition as brick types
were varied and more brick than would be in a single home were observed on site.
North, west, and east of the bare area was planted pine trees less than 20 years
old. South of the bare area was pasture grass. Shovel tests v1, v2, j1-3 were excavated
on the natural slope south of the level area. All five shovel tests found shallow clay loam
with mottles of red, brown, and gray suggesting the area was disturbed (Table 1 and
Figure 3).

No cultural resources were found in the shovel testing or the surface

inspection. No further work is recommended for the well site.

Pipeline
The proposed pipeline will be on the north side of an existing improved gravel
road. The total pipeline length is approximately 262 m (860 ft) from the well site to a
water tank on an existing water facility. The pipeline will cross the headwaters of an
upland drainage. No stream channel was observed at the crossing site. Vegetation is
mixed immature pine and hardwood trees with a dense to moderate understory of various
bushes and shrubs. North of the road were two abandoned mobile residence with no
obvious utilities. South of the road was populated with several inhabited mobile

residences with buried utilities and driveways. The pipeline will cross the road and enter
an existing water utility area.

This area was level with gravel and several buried

pipelines.
Shovel tests were limited to the north side of the road along the proposed pipeline
route.

Shovel Tests j4, j5 and v3-6 were excavated on the north side of the pipeline

corridor in an area less disturbed by the road and further from potential unmarked buried
utilities. Tests found 10 to 40 cm (4 to 16 in) of red, brown, and gray clay, clay loam,
and sandy loam. No artifacts were found in the shovel testing effort.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed City of Hemphill, Texas water well and raw water line will utilize a
0.2 ha. (0.5 ac) area on an upland ridge shoulder. A surface inspection found the well
area was heavily disturbed and the pipeline route paralleling an existing improved gravel
road. The excavation of 11 shovel tests found shallow disturbed soils across the project
area.
The Pratt house, moved to the property in 2008 was burned to the ground and the
remains mixed with existing rubble piles along the north and west sides of a cut/fill area.
The location has no association with the house and none of the house features remain
intact on the site. No State Antiquities Landmarks will be affected by the proposed
construction. No cultural resources were documented during the surface inspection or the
shovel testing of the project area.

Based on the shovel test results and the visual

examination, there is little chance of encountering undiscovered cultural resources in the
project area; however, in the event that human remains and/or archaeological materials
are discovered during construction, then the project activity will immediately cease and
the THC shall be notified of the discovery.

DETAC requests concurrence with a

determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible for the NRHP as defined by
the National Historic Preservation Act.
