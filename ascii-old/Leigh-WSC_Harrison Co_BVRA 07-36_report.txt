Introduction
The Leigh Water Supply Corporation (WSC) proposes to improve its water
distribution to customers in rural Harrison County by the installation of 67.85
miles of water line. The new lines will range in size from 3” to 10” and will be
installed within the highway rights-of-way. The depth of the r In addition, a water
tower will be constructed. Funding for this project will be provided by the United
States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development with Joe Jones the agency
representative. The Leigh WSC submitted plans for this project to USDA for
consideration. A response was received by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC), Archeology Division in a letter dated November 30, 2007 signed by
William A. Martin for F. Lawerence Oaks, the State Historic Preservation Officer.
This letter stated that its review staff (led by Debra L. Beene) identified 38 high
probability areas that are recommended for archaeological survey. It was
recommended that these 38 areas be investigated by pedestrian survey
accompanied by shovel testing and/or backhoe trenching depending upon the
specific project impacts. The high probability areas were identified by circles on
copies of the topographic maps provided by the engineers. There were no
specific instructions for any of the 38 areas. After a cursory review of the preselected high probability areas, the following was revealed. Five areas crossed
main channels of creeks, 22 areas crossed minor streams and tributaries of
named creeks, 6 areas did not cross any creeks, and 7 areas were near
cemeteries as indicated on the topographic maps. When every stream depicted
on the map was counted the total was 56. It became apparent that a pre-survey
assessment would be needed in order to give the client a price for this project.
The first step was a search on the Archeological Sites Atlas for previously
recorded sites within the footprint of the proposed waterline or water tower site.
No sites were found in either of these areas.
Pre-Survey Assessment
BVRA contacted the Leigh WSC and talked with William Power the Water
Manager and made arrangements to visit the project area. On January 8, 2008,
William E. Moore met with Mr. Power and they visited the high probability areas
selected by the THC. Twelve of the 38 areas were not visited because Mr.
Power said that these areas would not be receiving service. The engineers
should not have plotted these areas on the maps. The remaining 26 areas were
visited and evaluated in terms of the need for shovel testing and/or backhoe
trenching. Photographs were taken of selected areas to document the field
conditions in areas where shovel testing might be expected, and all cemeteries in
close proximity to the Area of Potential Effect (APE) were photographed as well.
Comments were written on a Field Evaluation sheet for each of the 38 areas.

Results and Conclusions
The pre-survey assessment evaluated 26 areas selected by the THC as
high probability areas for survey. Twelve of these areas (4, 6-7, 9-14, 33, 35, 38)
will not be serviced by Leigh WSC and are, therefore, not part of this project.
Five cemeteries are located in close proximity to the proposed water line;
however, they will be avoided by placing the water line on the opposite side of
the road. Four of the 26 areas (8, 15-16, 34) have no creek crossings and are
not recommended for survey. The majority of the pre-selected high probability
areas are crossed by minor tributaries and the upper reaches of tributaries.
These are viewed by BVRA as very low probability areas for prehistoric sites. In
some cases, the creek crossings (as indicated on the topographic map) were not
visible on the ground. Many of these streams are small channels created by
runoff from other streams. Most of the areas adjacent to streams where sites are
likely to be found contain clay or gravel at the surface. In other areas, the water
line will be placed within the right-of-way that is below the landform where a site
is likely to be found. Although several standing structures older than 50 years
were observed along the route of the proposed water line, not one is within the
APE. A field log detailing each area investigated and selected photographs are
appended to this report.
Recommendations
BVRA believes that it is highly unlikely that significant archaeological sites
are present within the current APE. It is, therefore, recommended that the Leigh
WSC be allowed to proceed with their project as planned without further
consultation with the THC.
