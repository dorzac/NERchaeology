After a period of two years serving as editor of
the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society, it is
now time to turn over the duties and responsibilities
of editor to the capable hands of Nancy Kenmotsu.
In order to assist the new editor and to help
reduce the unfortunate time delays in publishing
the ETAS that marked my tenure as editor, a
specific request of future contributors is in order.
With few exceptions, the submissions I reviewed
and edited over the past two years had citation
and reference errors. These included incorrect lists
of authors, incorrect sequences of authors and
dates in citations, missing references, inconsistent formats, confused publication dates, and other

problems. The editing process and production of
the BTAS would be much more efficient and
timely if contributors would take the time to carefully check their citations and references. In addition, as stated under the heading "Information for
Contributors" in the back of each BTAS volume,
it would be an immense assistance if authors
would consult the style guide for American Antiquity and follow the citation and bibliographic format guidelines in that document. A copy of the
style guide may be downloaded from the Society

(41UV132), Uvalde County, Texas
Ed Baker

ABSTRACT
The 1989 and 1990 University of Texas at Austin and Texas Archeological Society Field School
excavations at the Smith site revealed a se1ies of buried prehistoric occupations, ai1ifacts, and features dated
between 8000-1000 years ago. These archeological deposits included at least six isolated Early Archaic burned
rock features, a late Middle Archaic to Late Archaic I burned rock midden, and superimposed Late Archaic II
features and associated deposits.

INTRODUCTION
The Smith site (41lJV132) is a bmied multiple
component Archaic site south of Utopia in northeastern Uvalde County. The site formed in the primary or Tl terrace of the Sabinal River where it
exits the Edwards Plateau margin (Figure 1). Excavations carried out at the site in 1989 (Hester et al.
1989) by the summer field school of the University
of Texas at Austin and in 1990 (Hester l 990a, l 990b)
by the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) revealed
a series of occupations, artifacts, and features dated
between 8000-1000 years before present (B.P.). In
terms of setting, site formation, and material culture,
the site is similar to many other buried Archaic stream
terrace sites at the Edwards Plateau margin.
Similarly located buried sites with evidence of
at least sporadic Archaic occupations of several
thousand years or more, were once said to exemplify the "Edwards Plateau Aspect" (Campbell
1948; Jelks 1951; Kelley 1947; Weir 1976) of the
Balcones phase. That term was eventually discarded
as accumulating radiocarbon and stratigraphic excavation data allowed a more faithful and more
specific temporal subdivision of the lengthy Archaic periods. Since then, there have been a great
many other published excavations of what could be
called, in awkward terms, "long-term Archaic" occupational terrace sites along the Edwards Plateau
margin (e.g., Black and McGraw 1985; Collins et
al. 1998; Decker et al. 2000; Houk et al. 1999;
Johnson 1995; Kibler and Scott 2000).

At the Smith site, excavations encountered at
least six isolated Early Archaic burned rock features, a late Middle Archaic to Late Archaic I (cf.
Johnson and Goode 1994) burned rock midden
(BRM), and superimposed Late Archaic II features
and deposits. This paper outlines excavations at the
site, its likely formation processes, the kinds of
artifacts and features that were recovered in the
work, and briefly discusses some of the recovered
tool assemblage (see also Baker 1999).

REGIONAL SETTING
The Smith site is in an ecotonal setting, with
ready access to plant and animal resources from the
xeric Edwards Plateau and the spring-fed Sabinal
River valley. Abundant chert cobbles, ultimately derived from Edwards Plateau limestone, are carried
locally in the riverbed. Although the te1nce was
(and is) occasionally flooded, the site is generally
flat, dry, well drained, and close to permanent water.
Like most buried terrace sites along the
Edwards Plateau margin, the Smith site is on the
first terrace level (Tl) above the modern river bed
(Figure 2). Along the Sabinal River, these terraces
are typicaUy 7-10 m above the cmTent stream level.
Floodwater will occasionally encroach onto these
terraces, disburse across the flat expanse, and deposit sediments carried from upstream.
The bulk of sediment deposition occurred during the earlier half of the Holocene (10000-5000

B.P.). This Early and Middle Holocene depositional
phenomenon seems to be fairly typical at Holocene
terraces around the Edwards Plateau margin (Collins
1995; Mear 1998) and is most likely related to both
long-term precipitation patterns across the region and
the similar geomorphic contexts of such buried Archaic sites along larger creeks and rivers of the plateau margin.
To date, 11 radiocarbon dates have been obtained from the principal terraces of the Sabinal

River (Table 1). These dates, and a geomorphic
analysis of the Sabinal River valley by Mear ( 1995),
conform to broader temporal summaries of the geomorphology of the Central Texas (or perhaps more
precisely the Edwards Plateau margin) area. The
dating of the various Sabinal River and Smith site
sediment units also conform to temporally diagnostic artifacts found during the excavations. As mentioned above, the site has a surficial to slightly
buried Late Archaic II (cf. Johnson and Goode 1994)

component, with a Late Archaic I (Pedernales/
Kinney time interval) BRM beneath these. A Middle
Archaic (ca. 4000 B.P.) palimpsest deposit with
some intact features lies at the base of the BRM.
Beneath these strata, in the lowest deposits, are
several isolated Early Archaic features.

EXCAVATIONS AND RECORDS
Thomas R. Hester recorded the Smith site
(41UV132) in 1988. A couple of small potholes
had uncovered chert artifacts, a few burned rocks,
and unidentifiable fragments of animal bone. Diagnostic artifacts suggested that Middle and Late Archaic time periods were represented here, and given
the setting, the presence of buried Archaic occupational strata was suspected. No evidence of a BRM
was seen at the time excavations were started, but
later excavations by a University of Texas at Austin field school in 1989 and by the TAS in 1990
exposed this midden.
Field school students excavated the site over
six weeks in June and July 1989, with Hester's
supervision. Thirty-one students and volunteers,
along with teaching and research assistants Jeffrey

Huebner, Paul Maslyk, Christine Ward, and Jon
Hageman, constituted the field crew.
The first 30 cm of excavated earth contained
prehistoric artifacts and fragments of 20th century
glass, nails, and ceramics. This mantle of sediment
represented flood deposits from a locally famous
1930s storm. Extensive gopher burrows caused vertical displacement of small and large artifacts in
most areas of the site and were especially prevalent
in the upper deposits. The BRM seemed to be an
exception, as evidenced by the sole occurrence of
contemporaneous Kinney and Pedernales artifacts
in its deposits.
The 1989 field school included excavations at the
Smith site as one of several projects that year. These
excavations led to discovery of the buried BRM. First,
a vertical and horizontal datum, arbitrarily assigned
north and west grid coordinates of NlOO WlOO, was
used to establish a grid of 2 x 2 m squares over the
site. The midden excavators created two long, 1 m
wide trench exposures. These two trenches exposed
the midden deposit (Figure 3) in profile.
These 2 x 2m squares were then divided into
quadrants (NW, SW, etc.) that became the actual
1 x 1 m hand-excavated units. Each square was
excavated in 10 cm arbitrary levels, with level 1 at
the top of the deposit used to standardize the elevations of each unit and level them with the others. Vertical control was established with the use
of transit elevations taken on the southwest corner
of each unit, and .was maintained by the excavators with line levels.
All feature artifacts, charcoal, and matrix
samples were removed and recorded separately from
the unit/level materials. Initially, all matrix was
passed through 1/s-inch dry screens. When faunal
remains appeared to range from absent to very badly
fragmented and unidentifiable, excavations switched
to the use of 1/4-inch dry screens.

1989 SITE EXCAVATIONS
After the burned rock midden (BRJ\1) was found
at the Smith site (Figure 4), research goals included
stripping the surface of the BRM for clues as to its
structure and formation and trenching the midden
with a series of 1 x 1 m squares, in an attempt to
expose oven features. Eventually, 27 square meters
of the previously buried feature were exposed. The
densest part of the midden occurred at the center of

artifacts date the midden to the Late Archaic I
period. Middle Archaic La Jita and Nolan points
found at the base of the midden may be related to
its earliest use, however.
La Jita and Nolan points were found immediately beneath and adjacent to the lowest levels of the
burned rock midden. Within the 40 cm of matrix
excavated beneath the BRM, burned rock hearths
were found, along with Uvalde, Martindale, Andice/
Bell, and Early Triangular forms. These lower deposits, with their many identifiable, but isolated Early
and Middle Archaic features, became a focus of excavations in June 1990, by the Summer Field School
of the Texas Archeological Society.

the exposure. The domed midden was 50 cm thick
there, where it approached the ground surface, and
the midden sloped downward in all directions. In
those units where the BRM periphery was exposed,
the midden was encountered between 20 and 30 cm
below the surface. In other words, the exposed portion of the midden indicated it was mounded in
form, densest and thickest in its center, and sloped
downward and became less dense towards its peripheries. No internal structural patterns such as
hearths, larger or smaller rocks, depressions, or other
internal features such as stains or concentrations of
artifacts were seen on the surface or within the
midden. The excavated portion of the midden
seemed to be constructed of dispersed structural
elements (cf. Black 1997:83). Numerous Pedernales
and Kinney tools were found within the midden to
the general exclusion of other types, and these

The 1990 Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
field school had some 500 participants, who completed many excavation and survey projects in and
around Sabinal Canyon; the excavations at the Smith
site were among the principal TAS projects. Lori
Smith Douglas, John Hageman, Jaques Jaquier, and
Bob Turner co-directed the 1990 field research at
the site. Forty-six I x 1 m units east and southeast
of the BRM were excavated in 1990.
The goals of the 1990 excavations were to
learn more about the Early-Middle Archaic period
occupations at the site (Hester 1990a) and to further expose the surface and peripheries of the
BRM. During the one-week field school, the field
school participants opened 13 new excavation
units, each 1 m square. The field schools' youth
program excavated 12 more 2 x 2 m units, through
10-30 cm of mixed historic-to-Late Archaic II deposits, stopping at the upper surface of the BRM.
Ten-centimeter arbitrary levels were used in the 1
x 1 m units, while the youth group peeled off the
mixed deposits over the BRM in one natural level.
All matrix was dry-screened through 1/4-inch mesh.
Eight new isolated features were recognized, and
several of these clearly dated to the Early Archaic. As is usual for buried terrace sites around
the Edwards Plateau (Thoms and Mandel
1992:43; Prewitt 1981a:235; Wesolowsky et al.
1976:33), Early Archaic materials were much
more contextually segregated and more readily
and fruitfully sampled, due to their stratigraphic
separation and relative isolation from the other
later prehistoric components.

sediments towards its peripheries.

SITE RECORDS
The excavations and subsequent laboratory
analysis generated an array of site records. During
the 1989 and 1990 field seasons, 10 cm level forms
were used to record the excavators' progress through
each unit and level. Items felt to be unique were
given three-point proveniences, (e.g., Nl02 El08,
98.30 cm below datum) were collected separately,
and were given a serial number on a unique item
log. Burned rocks were removed from the matrix,
weighed, and recorded on the appropriate level or
feature forms. All matrices went to the screens
where debitage, whole snails, and other items not
designated as "unique" were bagged together and
sent to the laboratory. In the 1989 season crew
chiefs recorded feature data in excavation journals
and on level forms. In the 1990 season, the excavators recorded features on separate feature forms.
Eventually all collections were processed at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

The material was sorted into general groupings (i.e.,
snails, debitage), and then tallied for each provenience.
Lab analysts removed additional noteworthy artifacts
(bifaces, tool fragments, etc.), from the general collection bags and added these to the unique Item log.
Another laboratory step was to take length, width, and
thickness measurements of each of the broken and
whole "Unique Item" artifacts. I added coded descriptions of each artifact (see Table 3, below). Artifact
categories and types were checked against published
references (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Suhm et al. 1954;
Turner and Hester 1993) and a modicum of consensus
was reached among graduate students and, of course,
lead investigator Dr. Thomas R. Hester. All Smith site
records are curated at TARL.

deposits as well as extensive post-depositional
disturbance, especially within the later Holocene
deposits. Their notes, and profiles and geomorphic
assessments by Gene Mear and Mike Blum, describe
a fairly straightforward geomorphic process by
which the site formed.
The site (and associated alluvial terrace) formation process can be visualized in four stages
(Figure 5). During the Early Archaic, rapidly accumulating alluvium covered what subsequently became discrete Early Archaic occupations represented by small burned rock features. Second, during the Middle Archaic, alluvial (stream) deposition slowed, then in essence stopped, at least partly
due to the increased relative height of the terrace,
but also due to increasing regional aridity. Middle
Archaic artifacts accumulated on the surface and
intermingled with both prior and later materials.
Third, during the Late Archaic I interval, the BRM
was created, with its associated Pedernales and
Kinney points, while alluvial deposition occurred
infrequently, if at all. Finally, from Late Archaic II
through historic periods, slow alluvial deposition
resumed, leaving a semi-stratified accumulation of
artifacts that dated from the Late Archaic II time
period to the present day. The site was capped by a
1930s flood deposit, made possible in part by the
disturbance of the landscape caused by the widespread use of mechanized farming techniques and/
or subsequent erosion.
The rapidly buried (ca. 0.03cm/year) Early Archaic features and artifacts accumulated between

about 8000-7000 B.P. and 5000 B.P., as indicated
by the recovery of the latest Paleoindian style lanceolate point fragments, Uvalde and Martindale
points, and our knowledge of other buried Early
Archaic settings, sites and features (e.g., Collins
1995:376; Hester 1971; Luke 1980; Sorrow 1969;
Toomey 1993) from the Edwards plateau margins.
Feature 4 (Table 2) was found in direct association
with both a Uvalde point and a Guadalupe tool, and
has a 1 sigma calibrated date of 6280-6410 B.P. or
4330-4460 B.C. (see Table 1).
The Middle Archaic occupation of the site appears
to have begun by 5000 B.P. and to have lasted until
about 4000 B.P. Its representative strata are only
about 10 cm thick, implying that sediment accumulation had slowed considerably (ca. 0.01 cm/year)
or had in fact stopped. La Jita, Early Triangular,
and a few Nolan points appear together here, just
below and at the base of the BRM. Feature 23 was
found in direct association with an Early Triangular
point. Feature 14 was found very much nearby and
may be considered contemporaneous (see Tables l
and 2). Calibrated 2 sigma age ranges for these
features are 4430-4630 B.P. (2480-2680 B.C.) and
4770-4800 B.P. (2820-2850 B.C.) for Feature 14
and 4440-4650 B.P. (2490-2700 B.C.), 4670-4700
B.P. (2720-2750 B.C.), and 4760-4810 B.P. (28102860 B.C.) for Feature 23.
The earlier part of the Late Archaic period (ca.
4000-2500 B.P., see Collins 1995) is represented
by very slow sediment deposition, by the apparent
accumulation of the BRM, and by a preponderance

Baker-1989 and 1990 Excavations at the Smith Site (41UV132), Uvalde County, Texas
of Pedemales and Kinney artifacts both within the
midden and at its base. Although the mass of the
BRM may date exclusively to the Pedernales/
Kinney time interval, Pedernales artifacts occur in
all other areas of the site and indicate how mixed
the Middle and Late Archaic artifacts really are.
The numerous, almost ubiquitous, Pedernales point
also occurs with both earlier and later styles of
artifacts in upper and lower strata, indicating the
amount of natural and cultural disturbance the site
has undergone, such as animal burrowing, as well
as the inevitable human-generated disturbances.
Deposition appears to have finally covered the
Middle Holocene stable surface and the mound of
burned rock in the latter part of the Late Archaic
period to modem times (post-2500 B.P.). Sediments
resumed their slow accumulation, at about 0.014 cm/
year. Even at this increased annual rate, the thinnest
rock features, say 3 cm thick, would require over
200 years to be buried. Understandably, this time
period is marked by the jumbled accumulation of
Marshall, Marcos, Montell, Castroville, and Frio dart
points, (a frequent condition within Late Archaic II
deposits at long used-Archaic terrace sites in the
Edwards Plateau; see Collins et al. [1998:59] and
Patterson [1987:106-107]). Of course, displaced examples of Pedemales and earlier artifacts are also
mixed in with the Late Archaic deposits. These occupational remains indicate a time span of around
2500 to 1500 B.P. for continued prehistoric use of
the Smith site. Except for one Edwards arrow point,
Late Prehistoric artifacts are absent from the recovered materials at the site. Historic 1930s glass and
metal artifacts are scattered in the flood deposits
above the midden (0-30 cm below surface).

MATERIAL CULTURE
AND FEATURES
A total of 768 non-lithic debitage artifacts was
recorded as "unique items" after both field seasons
and laboratory processing. These are: 302 bifaces
and biface fragments, 89 cores, four drills or
perforators, two ground stone tools, eight historic
artifacts, 17 utilized flakes, 326 projectile points,
point preforms, and probable point fragments, 14
scrapers, four unifaces, one bifacial Guadalupe tool,
and one Clear Fork tool. Due to the large volume of
recovered tools, only named point and tool types
are discussed here (see also Baker 1999).

11

Of the 326 projectile points, point preforms,
and point fragments cataloged, 215 were matched
to published, described types, and analyzed by
the collection of descriptive data (Table 3), using coded descriptors developed by Johnson
(1995), among others, for tools from this part of
Central Texas. In addition, a Clear Fork tool and
a Guadalupe tool are described herein. The analyzed assemblage (a few specimens, particularly
a sample of at least five Early Triangular points,
were not available for analysis) can be broken
down, by types, as follows: possibly Late
Paleoindian lanceolate, parallel flaked fragments
(n=4), Nolan (n=l3), La Jita (n=30), Castroville
(n=lO), Kinney (n=20), Uvalde (n=7), Martindale
(n=9), Pedernales (n=76), Andice/Bell (n=4),
Early Triangular (n=l), Marcos (n=lO), Marshall
(n=l 1), Montell (n=8), Williams (n=3), Ensor
(n=l), Frio (n=6), and Edwards (n=l).
Twenty-three burned rock features were recorded over the two field seasons (Figure 6; see
also Table 2). Most of the feature matrix from the
different features were sampled and curated
unanalyzed at TARL. These materials may one day
offer much in the way of insights into cooking
pathways and associated techniques (after Ellis
1997:54-81). Table 2 offers tentative time intervals
for the features, a list of curated materials for each
feature, and elementary morphological groupings.
The majority of the more coherent features belong
to the Early Archaic, when sediment deposition
was at its most rapid.
To simplify the descriptions, features have
been classified into three categories (see Table
2). "Slab Lined Hearth" stone features consist
of more or less contiguous horizontal concentrations of burned rock, most often still in
rounded stream-cobble form, both with and
without additional rock below. These often contain two layers of rock in the central portion of
the hearth. "Ring Hearth" features are smaller
in diameter, single-layered, and sometimes
empty centered rings of limestone, recorded
both with and without other burned rocks nearby
(Figure 7). "Cluster" features are discontinuous
groupings of burned or unburned limestone
rock, which were found to be irregularly spaced,
but relatively concentrated spatially. When
available from excavation forms, burned rock
weights and counts provide some sense of rock
size and fragmentation within the various fea-

tures (see Table 2). Bulk soil samples from the
features have not yet been processed, screened,
or floated.
The time periods assigned for each feature are
also listed at the far right of Table 2. These are
based on the position of the feature in the excavation block and in profile. Eight features certainly
predate the BRM. The rest are coeval with or postdate the Pedernales interval (of the Late Archaic I
period) midden.

SITE COMPONENTS
The Smith site is a buried Early to Late Archaic
site. Suhm et al. (1954) considered similar longterm occupation sites at the Edwards Plateau margin
to be evidence of a single cultural tradition, the
"Edwards Plateau Aspect." Later researchers
acknowledged that typical sites of the Edwards
Plateau Aspect or the "central Texas Archaic" (Weir
1976) were found along the terraces of perennial
and ephemeral streams, particularly where they left
the Edwards Plateau. As agricultural activity and
road building frequently expose these buried sites,
they have become better known over the years.

EARLY ARCHAIC PERIOD
Site Formation Process and Features
The interpretive signific;ance of the various occupations at the Smith site is based in great part
on the site formation processes active at the time
of their creation. The Early Archaic occupations
here, and at many Archaic terrace sites in Central Texas, show evidence of relatively rapid
burial. This rapid deposition is due at least in
part to the great deal of loose sediment available
on the Edwards Plateau uplands in the latest
Pleistocene and Early Holocene (ca. 11,000-6000
B.P.) periods. During that time, so much loose
sediment rested in today's eroded plateau uplands that earth-dwelling creatures like moles
and prairie dogs lived in what are today the very
thin rocky, soils known from the Edwards Plateau (Toomey 1993). In the Early Holocene,
much of this accumulated upland sediment was
transported to today's lowland stream terraces.
The transported sediment formed thick cumulic
Early Archaic soils and created buried cultural
strata. Either way, up to six coherent burned

16

rock features may belong within this time frame.
These include isolated slab-lined hearth features
(Features 2, 5, and 15), generally smaller open
burned rock rings (Feature 4), and burned rock
clusters (Features 3 and 21) (see Table 2).
It has also been hypothesized that a wetter (Figure 8) Early Hvlocene climate played a role in
forming the thicker deposits (Collins 1995), while
others suggest that it was drier then in comparison
to today and that deposition was characterized, as it
is today, by occasional violent flooding. In later
time periods somewhat less upland sediment availability (today's floods can still deposit a lot of dirt
on the Sabinal terraces), combined with a higher
relative terrace elevation, and changing weather regimes, led to slow sediment deposition across the
Smith Site. In either case, the Middle Holocene,
post-Early Archaic, result is the same: less sediment deposition on the terrace, more lateral erosion
at the terrace edges, and compressed archeological
deposits and features.
Lanceolate Component
Three lanceolate parallel-flaked tool fragments
from the lowest levels at the Smith site hint at the
earliest Archaic or very Late Paleoindian occupation at the site (Figure 9). One specimen is Angostura-like, with a thick central ridge and serrations
on one side. The fragment exhibits an impact fracture in its midsection and an impact burin at the tip.
Its stem and base are ground, with heavier grinding
on the base. Another lanceolate specimen is badly
burned. Very late Paleoindian style artifacts are
often the earliest artifacts in collections from bur-

ied terrace sites around the region (Table 4), and
they likely date to around 6800 B.C. (Hester
1980:94-108; Collins et al. 1998).
Collins (1995) indicates that these Angostura-like or lanceolate point fragments may mark,
among other things, the first signs of Holocene
deposition on the Edwards Plateau margin terraces, and the beginnings of today's more familiar landscapes. These latest Paleoindian lithic
artifacts may be properly placed within geologically, and perhaps, culturally-specific Early Archaic contexts. Analysis of similar artifacts from
the Wilson-Leonard site suggests that Late
Paleoindian dart points were used alongside some
of the earliest Early Archaic stemmed points,
particularly those stemmed Early Archaic points
exhibiting stem grinding and alternate beveling
of the blade (Dial et al. 1998:318). At the Smith
site, this earliest component was scarce and scattered, as it is at many sites in the region. Parts of
the component may have been re-deposited or
disturbed during the first flush of Holocene deposition. The points and their associated component are most interesting because they represent
some of the earliest signs of a long-term cultural
phenomenon (Hester 1986) that stretches across
the region, namely their marking the first uses of
significant places on the landscape that would
see repeated occupations, and perhaps also a
"shared cultural memory" of the use of such longterm sites for the next seven millennia.
Feature 5 is a slab-lined feature that may date
to one of the earliest occupations of the site. An
Angostura-like point, with impact burin and

biface were found within the same
unit/level. Two of the rocks at the
northern perimeter of the feature had
fractured in place. The rest of the
rocks are unbroken stream cobbles,
indicating a somewhat limited use-life
and/or low firing temperatures for the
feature.
The feature was cross-sectioned
along a medial line. The sediment beneath the rocks had no charcoal, but
did contain concentrations of baked
clay. Very few flakes were found in or
around the feature, but three rock
samples and three soil samples were
taken from the feature.
This feature is morphologically
very similar to the other Early
Archaic features. Collins (1995)
noted a few years ago that what
subsistence indicators there are for
this part of the Early Archaic point
toward the processing of deer, small
animals, and plant materials for food.
The small number of lanceolate
points at the Smith site, with small
rock features similar to later Archaic
features, indicates the same subsistence pursuits.

Uvalde, Martindale, and similar splitstem artifacts from the southern Edwards
Plateau are now thought to date to 70006000 years ago (Collins 1995:376; Hester
1971, 1995:436), if not slightly earlier. At
the Smith site, most of the Uvalde and
Martindale points occur together and below the BRM. A close examination of the
26 Uvalde and Martindale specimens
shows them to occur along a typological
gradient according to stem and blade treatment (cf. Hester 1971). Those with narrower blades and stems better fit definitions for Uvalde points, while points with
broader blades and stems are typed as
Martindale points (Figure 10). A statistical analysis of Early Archaic bifurcate
stemmed points from the Wilson-Leonard
site confirmed that these two point styles

a large charcoal sample with a calibrated I -sigma
age range of 6280-6410 B .P. was obtained from the
feature's central depression (see Tables 1and2). A
Guadalupe tool (Figure 11) was found within the
charcoal-flecked matrix outside the stone circle.
Five charcoal samples, including the dated sample,
three burned clay samples, debitage, and two bone
fragments were separately recovered and are curated
together. Site notes on file at TARL indicate that
analysis of archeomagnetic samples taken from the
rocks at the perimeter of this feature by Dr. Wulf
Gose (Geology Depaiiment at the University of
Texas) revealed that the stones surrounding the central depression had cooled in place.
The ring-shaped Feature 4 looked like a pit
oven that had been used and cleared out several
times, and had formed a hardened, fired clay bottom.
It may also resemble Early Archaic "cooking
hearths" at the Sleeper site (Johnson 1991:47-53).
These small, circular, features are typical of many
Early Archaic terrace sites (e.g., Sorrow et al. 1967).
Although numerous Early Archaic features have
been excavated by Texas archeologists, too few
have been analyzed, and too few broad Early
Archaic strata have been exposed, to generalize
about how, when, how often, or why exactly these
rock features were used. Although we know these
small features are typical for the time period, we do
not know if these small features tend to occur in

have a continuum of attributes (Kerr and Dial
1998:503) that for the most part have been arbitrarily
divided into broader and narrower blade styles.
Feature 4 (Figure 12) appeared to be a charcoal
and debris-filled pit or pit oven, surrounded by burned rocks thatdated to the
Uvalde/Martindale time period or style interval. The feature was apparently constructed in a basin about 80 cm in diameter (as defined by charcoal-stained soil),
and was approximately 30 cm deep. It is
ringed by limestone rocks 5-15 cm in diameter; one of these stones had cracked in
situ. In addition, about twenty 5-15 cm
stones appeared to have been spread or
raked northwestward up to 45 cm away
from the top of the feature.
During the excavations, burned clay
and charcoal flecking was noted around
the feature, including those portions that
spread out to the northwest. Many lumps
of burned clay defined the central depression of the feature. Charcoal, a small
amount of debitage, badly fragmented
bone, and snails were noted within the

clusters representing several fires used by the same
band of people, or if they represent cook-fires (or
some other fire) made by a solitary individual. In the
case of the broad excavations at the Sleeper site,
many sandstone grinding-type tools were found near
Early Archaic features, apparently indicating that a
group camp of some duration (long enough to create
and use metates on-site) was represented at that time.
In the Early Archaic component at the Smith site, no
grinding tools or the raw material for them were
found, but quite a few chipped stone tools (impacted
points, a Guadalupe tool, bifaces, cores, etc.) were.
Perhaps the Sleeper and Smith sites represent
different kinds of Early Archaic camps.

they took advantage of the fresh water supply and
utilized the abundant nearby chert cobbles to
manufacture tools. There is evidence, from the
broken and use-impacted projectile points and small
burned bone fragments, that game was processed
and cooked here. Vegetal processing is not
evidenced directly, although the single Guadalupe
tool recovered from the Early Archaic deposits may
have been used for such pursuits. The many distinct
features and curated feature matrices, when analyzed
in detail, may yield significant information on both
vegetal and animal processing.

Alluvial deposition across the site slows conThe terminal Early Archaic archeological desiderably towards the end of the Uvalde/Martindale

in the form of surface gullies and lateral erosion by
and features. Although not clearly
separated, many preserved features
were found in these levels. Because this compressed, yet not totally disturbed, context occurs so
often at terrace sites on the
Edwards Plateau margin, distinct
isolated components from this time
period may best be studied at isolated upland sites, such as the upland midden at the Wounded Eye
site (Luke 1980) where a small
midden produced 27 Early Triangular points and bison bones, or at
the Landslide site (Sorrow et al.
1967), where an anomalous heavy
period of alluvial deposition isolated a Bell interval component
with bison bones and hearths. Figure 13 illustrates the six Early Triangular points from the Smith site
included in the analysis.
The overall impression of the
Early-Middle Archaic occupations
at the Smith site is that small
groups camped there, probably

daily activities. While camped,

the Sabinal, became a dominant landscape process.
Mear (1990) notes that the Sabinal River, and other
rivers, creeks, and gullies draining the Edwards
Plateau, incised downward during the Middle Archaic time period at about 5000 B.P. The end of
this terrace incision occurred ca. 4500 B.P.
This period of negligible deposition and likely
erosion coincides with the Middle Archaic period
occupation of the site. The relatively rapid deposition of the "early" Early Archaic deposits came to
an end, as did the sealing of isolated components.
Up to 10 features possibly dating to the Middle
Archaic time period were, however, recorded in this
strata. These include Features 14 and 23 (see Table
1). The many undated features found here may also
date to earlier or later time periods (see Table 2).
Nolan/La Jita Components

21

Feature 7, a marginal or scattered burned rock
feature, was recorded with an associated La Jita
point (see Table 2). The scattered rocks appeared to
be burned, but no other signs of burning were found
in the excavations.
The 30 La Jita points in the site collection
represent perhaps the largest curated collection
of its type from a single site. While most points
appear to be distinctly "La Jita-shaped," on others the rounded thin bases of the La Jita style
may grade into the squarer, thicker bases of the
Nolan type. Unlike Nolan points, the recorded
distribution of La Ji ta points is limited to southwestern Texas.
Hester (1985: 13) reported details of La Jitadated cooking pits, a burial, and an incipient midden
of La Jita age isolated below a larger BRM. Features 19 and 20 at the Smith site were recorded just
below the midden (see Table 2) and may represent
similar cooking features.

Nolan and La Jita points (Figure 14) are distributed at and around the base of
the BRM. The 10 Nolan points recorded appear a bit deeper, on average (level 7, 60-70 cm below
surface) than the 30 La Jita style
points (level 6, 50-60 cm below
surface), although few attempts
have been made to segregate the
two temporally due to lack of good
contextual data from archeological sites in the Edwards Plateau;
Collins' (1995:376) study of archeological style intervals in Central Texas noted as much. In fact,
that summary suggests there are
no excavated sites with better than
moderate integrity between the late
Early Archaic and the early part of
the Late Archaic, probably due to a
regional hiatus in deposition by
Edwards Plateau margin streams.
Like the latest Early Archaic sites,
sites from the Nolan/La Jita interval may present better contextual
and analysis opportunities at isolated upland localities such as
41GL160 (Kelly 1987), where colluvial deposition has preserved an
apparent Nolan interval occupation

The Nolan and La Ji ta types have been found at
other Central Texas sites both immediately below
and within BRM contexts. At the Panther Springs
Creek site (Black and McGraw 1985), they appeared
to be related to the beginnings of all four BRMs, as
well as with a large, rock-free, pit oven immediately

well dated due to a lack of diagnostic artifacts.
SolTow (1969:45) placed Bulverde and Nolan points
from the John Ischy site, in vertical Unit C, in an
area of concentrated burned rock below "the major
burnt rock concentration." At Jonas Terrace (Johnson
1995:285), the La Jita artifacts were assigned to a
pre-midden occupation, associated with "a few small,
stone-paved fireplaces."
The evidence from the Smith site and other
similarly dated occupations, such as the La Jita site,
indicate that many BRMs may have begun forming
during this interval, perhaps as a natural extension
of the repeated use of small-scale pit features on a
newly stabilized landscape. Although midden building behavior is recorded in all times, places, and
situations in Central Texas prehistory, the repeated
occulTences of large Middle Holocene BRMs on
non-aggrading (during the Middle Holocene) surfaces at the southeastern Edwards Plateau margin
suggests that geomorphic processes, namely a lack
of upland sediment supply, and perhaps changing
weather/flood patterns, may have combined with a
growing and increasingly important tradition of thermal "pit and stone" cooking to lead into the beginning of an era that has been called "the peak of
burned rock midden use on the Edwards Plateau"
(Prewitt 1981b:80).

LATE ARCHAIC

should occur only within the central area of the
midden. No p1imary thermal cooking structures were
found during the field school excavations but a
po11ion of the midden was not exposed. Likewise, no
distinctly structured cooking facilities were found in
units and levels stmounding the midden, excepting a
few of the relatively near, and presumably later (based
on profiles and geomorphology), Late Archaic II
Features 6, 9, 10, 16, and 22. These features are all
small and disorganized clusters and rings of rocks
(see Table 2).
Dr. Gose' s paleomagnetic samples of 12 burned
rocks from the upper midden indicated that the surface rocks had indeed been moved since cooling
(TARL site files). No hearths were located within
the midden. The burned rock features possibly related to the Late Archaic I (midden) time period
(such as Features l, 8, 13, 17, and 18) are marginal,
indistinct, and scattered. Taking this evidence at face
value, it appears that the BRM is the only definitive
Late Archaic I cooking/heating feature at the site.
After a thorough review, Black (1997:86) decided that most middens represent cooking facilities, while disposal of waste remained a "very plausible ... major secondary" formation process at some
middens (cf. Hester 1971). This is very likely the
case at the Smith site as great numbers of burned
and/or broken Pedernales points were recovered
within and near the midden along with thousands
of burned pieces of debitage, indicating the disposal of waste materials. Unlike Pedernales points,
which were distributed heavily within the midden
and throughout the site, the majority of Late Archaic I Kinney points were found unburned and
unbroken within and very near the BRM. This at
least leaves open the possibility that they may have
been used as tools for food preparation within or
near the midden.

Site Formation Process and Features
Very little sediment accumulated over the site in
the Late Archaic I time period. The BRM grew
exponentially. The mechanics of this dual cultural/
natural site formation process remains speculative,
but it is now well documented that the "big middens
on a stable surface" phenomena is expressed
repeatedly at telTaces of the Edwards Plateau margin.
Perhaps the midden represents a central-focused
cooking facility or more simply a large stone-lined
oven (Black 1997:84-85) used to cook great batches
of food. In this case, the primary structural elements

Pedernales/Khmey Components
Pedernales points were removed from the site
in large numbers. The 76 recorded points account
for just over 33% of the typed projectile points (see
Table 4). Although they were found, in at least
limited numbers, in all post-Early Archaic contexts,
their highest concentration occurred in the bottom
half of the BRM and in slightly higher adjacent
areas around the midden. This distribution implies
that the BRM was formed in or created a depression. Smaller numbers of the points were also found

within 1 m of the BRM. The Kinney points/tools,
period may then be understandable. Conversely, if
which were (in percentages) by far the least-broken
the midden was not a primary cooking facility, perartifacts recovered at the site, may be related directly
haps there should have been, although there do not
appear to be, some appropriate
number of contemporary hearths
recorded nearby. Caution should be
exercised, however, because mostly
un-sarnpled, undated, and apparently burned, rock clusters (Features I, 8, 13, 17, and 18) were
recorded around the midden and
may date to the Late Archaic I or II
time frame (or conceivably even
the Middle Archaic).
To explore this apparent abundance of projectile points and preferential use of BRM technology
during the Pedernales interval, one
may look away from the rock-laden
a
Edwards Plateau margin and instead turn towards prairies to the
east. AtLoeve-Fox (Prewitt 1981a)
and the Bull Pen site (Ensor and
Mueller-White 1988), Pedernales
points have been found in association with small slab-lined cooking
features, indicating, perhaps, that
the use of BRM technology was
limited to areas with geophytes to
process, even if significant amounts
of limestone were on hand. At these
non-midden sites, Pedernales
points still formed the dominant
point style.
The multiple forms of Pedernales points recovered at the Smith
b
site are consistent with those preFigure 15. The use of a rock midden: a, a "centrally-focused cooking facility"

with the function of the midden itself. In other
words, most of the artifacts at the site seem to have
been broken, usually dming manufacture, with the
Kinney tools as an exception. Their recovery from
the midden is indicative of the context of their use
and eventual discard.
Reports of Kinney points have often divided the
type into larger and smaller forms (Shafer 1963:73;
Suhm and Jelks 1962:201). Other authors, such as
Weir and Doran (1980), Black and McGraw (1985),
Johnson (1991) and Goode (2002), have suggested
that Kinney points were used as knives, but the hypothesis remains untested and unproven. Weir and
Doran (1980) proposed the Anthon type name for
such specimens, particularly the larger Kinney forms,
but the nomenclature never came into general use.
The larger forms often occur with large billet scars,

but can be finely serrated along one
or both lateral edges.
At the Smith site, the larger
forms are all obviously bilaterally
asymmetrical, and most appear to
have use retouch and/or edge rejuvenating flakes removed from the
convex edges (Figure 16). Many
of the remnant flake scars along
the convex lateral edges of the
large Kinney tools appear to be
dulled and somewhat buffed, perhaps indicative of use with a sawing or cleaving motion along the
lateral edge. The smaller forms of
the Kinney tools are much more
symmetrical laterally, although a
few also exhibit lateral convexity/
concavity (Figure 17).
None of the Kinney artifacts,
large or small, have definitive impact fractures. With some of the
larger points, intentional bifacial
thinning extends around the ventral (point) tip of the artifact and
continues slightly along the concave lateral edge of the tool before terminating in a dull, unfinished, and perhaps unused lateral
edge. In another case, an evidently
complete large Kinney tool point
has cortex left on its unsharpened
tip, while the lateral edges exhibit
dulled retouch scars from apparent use. One other large specimen appears to have
been made on a flake, and is retouched bifacially
only along its convex edge. The less convex edge
of the flake has been left unworked. In all these
larger Kinky tools it appears that only the convex
lateral edge had been used.

During the latter half of the Late Archaic time

deposition appears to have been renewed at the site,

if individual features can be
accurately recorded. Such seems
to be the case with the multiple
expressions of Late Archaic II
occupations at the Smith site.
After this time period, prehistoric occupation of the site seems
to have ceased, save for a sole
Edwards arrow point. Why this
particular space was abandoned
during the Late Prehistoric, after
6000-7000 years of use, remains
unknown. Nearby, at the La Jita
site, the transition from Archaic
occupations to the Late Prehistoric
is well represented (see Table 4).

served repeatedly within the Late Archaic time
frame at buried Central Texas sites. The combination of slow and shallow sediment deposition, frequent disturbance by modern agriculture, and the
tendency of such sites to contain multiple mixed
Middle to Late Archaic components, has meant that
relatively little integrity remains in sites occupied
during this time period. Also, small, and shallow
vertical excavations of these sorts of sites may be
limiting the recognition of broader horizontal patterns that could offer more insight into the character of small burned features that appear to otherwise be disturbed.
Given these inherent limitations, it could be
argued that at sites with multiple and repeated
Late Archaic components and occupations in
shallowly buried contexts, the specific history of
occupations at such sites may be difficult, if not
impossible, to reliably sort out and interpret, even

Perhaps the most noteworthy
aspect of the 1989 and 1990 excavations at the Smith site was the
recording and sampling of up to
six distinct Early Archaic features.
Some of the Early Archaic burned
rock features were shallow slablined hearths, 1-2 m in diameter.
Two smaller charcoal-flecked
rock-lined or enclosed pits were
also found, along with two amorphous burned rock
clusters. Although site "architecture" has been reported from the study of an an-ay of well-preserved
Early Archaic components (Johnson 1991; Lintz et
al. 1995), no intra-site structural or feature patterning was noted here.
The Early Archaic tools from the Smith site will
also have a place in future studies. Recent work
(Dial et al. 1998) has shown that Early Archaic stone
tools of the region, dating to roughly 8000-6000
B.P., represent a very long-lived stone tool making
tradition, even by the standards of the culturally
conservative Central Texas Archaic. In many
excavated sites of the local region, the count of Early
Archaic points outweighs those of later time periods,
indicating that a successful and long-lived adaptive
pattern had been adopted by this date that was
designed to exploit the essentially modern local and
regional environment. Extremely densely populated

26

camps are apparently absent at this time, but small,
perhaps repeatedly used, short term camps of a
family unit, or perhaps groups of families, seem to
be indicated from the Early Archaic features
excavated in the Sabinal River area to date.
The Smith site also appears to be the third
excavated site in the Sabinal River Valley reported
to contain significant deposits containing both Nolan
and La Jita points (Hester 1971; Mueggenborg
1994). The two types date from the same interval,
or just as likely, are compressed upon the same
ancient living surfaces. Their typological attributes
are similar, with a broad blade and barb-less bases.
One of these types, La Jita, may represent a more
localized variation of the more widespread Nolan
type. There are significant differences in the two
types as well, as finished La Jita points have a wellthinned, bifacially-trimmed base, and rounded stems
with very little similarity to the prototypical squared
and beveled, thick, Nolan point stem. The temporal
and typological questions related to the two types
bear more examination than can be given here. The
La Jita point, in particular, represents a point used
over a relatively short-time span, with limited geographical distribution, and any isolated components
representing this interval should be pursued in detail in future archeological research efforts on the
Early Archaic in Central Texas.
Such isolated La Jita-bearing components may
be rare on Sabinal Valley terraces, however, due to
the lack of sediment deposition at that time. The
hallmark of La Jita/Nolan occupations in the Sabinal
Valley and elsewhere has been small pits and rock
features buried beneath BRMs. The location and
study of more isolated components of this time
period should clarify the early evolution and use of
burned rock midden technology within the valley.
The same could be said for Pedernales interval
sites. Even sites lacking the classic stratification
of components can yield important archeological
data. For example, one outstanding feature of the
Smith site midden is the numerous intact Kinney
tools recovered from it. Kinney points or tools
apparently represent a local material culture
adaptation for the southeast Edwards Plateau
margin. In contrast to the Pedernales points from
the midden, the Kinney points/tools are unburned
and unbroken. Although not proven, the Kinney
specimens may represent tools (e.g., knives) used
for at least one of the various activities carried on
at and near the BRM.

The midden was domed in shape, rising 30-40
cm above the local (Late Archaic I) terrain. Later
occupants of the site (i.e., post-Pedemales interval)
do not appear to have used the midden to any noticeable extent, or at least they did not leave their dart
points and other tools within it. The use and abandonment of the BRM, along with the ·plethora of
Pedernales points (33% of all the points, see Table
4), brings forth the question of a Pedernales interval
cultural or population "heyday." Looking at the projectile point data from the Sabinal Valley sites, the
interval is characterized by a very high point count
that cannot be solely attributed to preferential archeological sampling. These high counts may represent more people in the local region, or a different
cultural dynamic bringing more people to these large
midden sites; both alternatives seem likely given the
locally large BRMs indicative of the time period.
It is tempting to say that the massive burned
rock features may represent the accumulated debris
of a group preparing large amounts of food, perhaps as center-focused cooking features designed
to exploit geophytes. However, there were no such
ovens delineated at the Smith site.
The evidence from the Sabinal valley burned
rock middens continues to defy easy categorization. It has been frequently suggested that large
Pedemales interval BRMs in the region may be
indicative of a more sedentary, or at least somewhat more communal, lifestyle based on the care
and harvest of the abundant geophytes of the region. The supposed warm and dry conditions of the
period likely provided suitable conditions for greater
geophytes growth, increased use of permanent waterways, and less flooding of adjacent terraces,
thereby also allowing the midden features to accumulate as more or less permanently available appliances near sources of permanent water.
At the Smith site, Late Archaic II dart points
were found scattered in the fairly thin and substantially disturbed sediments that subsequently built
up, around, and eventually just over the highest part
of the midden. Partially disturbed fairly shallow
Late Archaic deposits seem to be the rule at Sabinal
River terrace sites. The Late Archaic II deposits at
the Smith site, in particular, are extremely mixed,
and outside of the material culture present, do not
appear to be temporally or spatially interpretable.
Any well-preserved Late Archaic II sites found in
the valley or in undisturbed upland contexts would
surely be of great archeological research value.

Baker-1989 and 1990 Excavations at the Smith Site (41UV132), Uvalde County, Texas 27
The Sabinal Valley projectile point data indicates that there are only five or so frequently encountered Archaic artifact types in the valley (see
Table 4). For the Archaic, these most heavily represented points are those of the Uvalde/Martindale
continuum (cf. Hester 1995), Nolan, La Jita,
Pedernales, and Montell types. Of these frequently
encountered Archaic points, only the La Jita style
seems to represent a regionally specific material
culture type that is specific to the southwestern
Edwards Plateau. The La Jita period was immediately followed by the formation of BRMs at several
Sabinal River valley sites.
The major later types found in the Sabinal/Frio
valley excavations listed on Table 4 are Frio,
Edwards, and Perdiz points. Although the Mingo
site has only Edwards points (Houk and Lohse 1993)
of the major later projectile point types, the Rainey
site has a great number of both Edwards and Perdiz
specimens (Henderson 2001), and still other sites,
like Blue Hole (Mueggenborg 1994) and La Ji ta,
have not only Frio, Edwards, and Perdiz points, but

also an entire array of earlier Archaic points. The
data seems to indicate that single component Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites as well as multicomponent Archaic-to-Late-Prehistoric sites are all
present in the general regional vicinity.
In some cases, there may well have been a
reason to favor different locations at different times
in prehistory, particularly at the Archaic/Late Prehistoric juncture. Of course, the best camping spots
were always occupied, but with the appearance of
the bow and arrow, at least some of the old camping site locations were given up, and new ones
chosen. The Smith site appears to be one of these,
and it would be interesting to know why the site
was abandoned, when, for example, the La Jita site,
just downstream, shares many of the same characteristics, but was never abandoned by prehistoric
peoples. Perhaps a fuller analysis of the Smith site
materials curated by the TAS-feature matrices,
lithic tools, snails, soils, rocks, and shells-will
provide more answers than this all too short summary can provide.

Some Notes on Bison, the Texas Post Oak Savanna,
and the Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
William A. Dickens and James E. Wiederhold

ABSTRACT
The use of bison during the Late Prehistoric period in many regions of North America has often been
interpreted as minor compared to deer and other game animals. Reasons for this include a lack of bison remains
in the archaeological record, the presence of ecological barriers, and/or a particular region's lack of habitat
suitable for the support of bison. Researchers have often neglected to fully understand the relationships of
wildlife and their habitats. One such region is the Post Oak Savannah of Texas. This paper combines a study of
bison ecology and prehistoric and historic hunting practices, as well as the incorporation of historical
documentation and the hunting practices of contemporary groups in similar environmental settings. The
conclusions derived from these lines of evidence results in the formulation of a practical model of bison
movements and bison utilization by Late Prehistoric peoples within the Texas Post Oak Savannah region.

INTRODUCTION
It is well known that bison were an important

resource for a large number of prehistoric and historic Indian cultures. Bison were used as a food
source, in the manufacture of tools and weapons,
clothing and shelter, and their hides were an important trade item (Creel 1991 ). The use of bison probably reached its zenith during the Late Prehistoric
when it is believed they reached their maximum
range (Barsness 1985:21-22; McDonald 1981:105).
The very adaptable nature of these animals enabled
them to occupy virtually every part of North
America except for southern Florida, the extreme
Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Alabama, the Pacific
Coast, and the Baja Peninsula. However, existing
within their range are some regions described as
having a more or less intermittent presence due to
local environmental conditions and human activities (McDonald 1981: 105). It is one of these regions that this paper will investigate.
Recent interest in the Texas Post Oak Savanna
region has led some researchers to review bison
presence and prehistoric use of bison within this
region, especially during the Late Prehistoric period (Ahr 1998b:4). This has led to two assumptions, a presence model and a non-presence model.
The non-presence model is based on two factors:

(1) the seemingly impenetrable nature of the Post

Oak Savanna and (2) the apparent lack of bison
remains within Late Prehistoric sites. The acceptance of these ideas has led some to believe that
bison in this region during the Late Prehistoric were
either non-existent or their presence was too small
to have any impact on the local native cultures.
Evidence supporting non-presence originates
from an idea that the Post Oak Savanna, or the Post
Oak "Belt" as it is often called, was composed of a
dense and impenetrable mixture of vegetation that
served as an effective barrier and limited movement into the region to only a few open "corridors,"
or via creek and river valleys (Thoms and Ahr
1995:35-36; Ahr 1998a:30; Ahr 1998b:4). It is also
argued that the nature of the region contained an
insufficient food supply that would have been rapidly depleted through the grazing of large numbers
of bison. Lastly, some feel that intensive human
predation concentrated along the edge of the Post
Oak Savanna effectively reduced bison populations
ultimately preventing any substantial numbers from
penetrating into the region.
Keeping these arguments in mind, this paper
will examine the biology and nature of bison and
the Post Oak Savanna region in an attempt to determine whether or not this region could and/or did
support large numbers of bison. Some may think

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 74 (2003)

Texas Archeological Society

that including a discussion of bison behavior is
redundant since bison habits are well known in the
literature and, therefore, a discussion of their habits
is not necessary. However, before making an argument for regional presence, a basic knowledge of
bison habits should be reviewed. For example, some
regional researchers rely on the accounts of the
1528-1536 journey of Cabeza de Vaca in making
assumptions of bison numbers during that period
(Salinas 1990:115; Ricklis 1996:107-108; Ahr
1998b:3; Foster 1998:115). Based on this account,
it is often accepted that bison were not in abundance at that time, not only in the Pecos River
region of West Texas and New Mexico where
Cabeza de Vaca first encountered bison (Barsness
1985:40), but in adjacent regions as well. However,
studies of bison show that they are often absent
from many parts of their "traditional" range for
varying periods of time that often extends over an
entire season or longer.
Thus, brief accounts of regional absences like
Cabeza de Vaca's may not accurately reflect true
regional population numbers at the time they are
recorded. Therefore, before such accounts can be
accepted or rejected or assumptions made for bison
presence in a specific region such as the Post Oak
Savanna, one must have some understanding of
bison behavior and habits.
In addition, reasons for the lack of bison remains within regional archaeological contexts will
also be explored. And lastly, an examination of
Late Prehistoric hunting and subsistence practices
will be discussed. Wherever possible, ethnohistoric
and historic accounts of early Spanish, French, and
American explorers and settlers of the region will
be provided.

BISON BIOLOGY
The species Bison bison first appeared around
5000 B.P. in the northern and central Great Plains
region where it rapidly spread, eventually replacing
the earlier form, Bison antiquus (McDonald
1981 :102). The decline of B. antiquus and rise of B.
bison is felt to be the result of environmental
changes that were occurring during the early
Holocene period. At that time, the primary
vegetation of the Great Plains was changing from
glacial forests, woodlands, and savannas to more
herbaceous grasslands. This rapid expansion of

grasslands was due primarily as a result of changing
climatic conditions that occurred about 4000 B.P.
These changes were favorable for deciduous
woodlands to begin expanding westward onto
prairie and prairie-forest ecotones along the edges
of the central grasslands from Alberta to Texas. A
northeastward expansion of grassland also occurred
during this period coinciding with the northward
shift of conifer forests into formerly glaciated areas
after 12,000 B.P. (McDonald 1981:30).
Human activities may also have played a significant role in the vegetative changes. Prehistoric
hunters were known to have employed the use of
fire in their hunting practices with the most immediate effect being an increase in the openness of
habitat. Periodic burnings could alter the composition and physiognomy of vegetation by eliminating
or reducing larger slower-maturing woody plants
and favoring the faster maturing herbaceous plants.
The result would be the establishment of openings
in mesic forests and the expansion of grasslands
(DeVivo 1990; McDonald 1981:31).
As the expansion of the grasslands increased,
B. antiquus, which was primarily adapted to a
savanna and wooded steppe type habitat, began to
decline and, coupled with the increasing presence
of B. bison, eventually disappeared by around 5000
to 4000 B.P. B. bison populations rapidly expanded, reaching the maximum extent of its primary range by 3000-2000 B.P. (McDonald
1981 :250). Improved habitat conditions resulting
from sudden climatic changes often resulted in an
increase in regional populations. Such an event
was the "Little Ice Age" of the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. This was a period of cooler and
wetter conditions that favored vegetative growth,
not only in North America but in Europe and other
parts of the world as well (Roberts 1991: 159-161).
Bison reacted to these conditions in North America
with a rapid increase in population around A.D.
1500 (McDonald 1981:262).
At present, there are two North American subspecies of bison: B. bison bison, or Plains Buffalo,
and B. bison athabascae, or Wood Buffalo, which
is the larger of the two subspecies (Cahalane
1954:81; McDonald 1981:108). Its greater size is
attributed to either: (1) a suspended equilibrium in
which B. athabascae retained large body size as it
evolved from B. antiquus or (2) is the result of an
adaptation from a grassland to a forest/woodland
environment. Elements of both could be operat-

Dickens and Weiderhold-Bison, Texas Post Oak Savanna, and Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
ing, but the latter is thought to have been the more
important factor over time. A mixing of the two
subspecies often occurs as movements of B. b.
bison range into the boreal parklands inhabited by
B. b. athabascae (Moodie and Ray 1976:45-52). It
has been noted that some individual B. b. bison
would remain within herds of B. b. athabascae
(McDonald 1981:260-261), often resulting in a
natural gene flow between the two subspecies. If
larger body size was a retained characteristic from
B. antiquus, then a gene flow between the smaller
B. b. bison with B. b. athabascae should have
some effect on the body size of B. b. athabascae.
However, no observable effect on the body size of
either B. b. bison or B. b. athabascae has been
determined as a result of these contacts; thus supporting the idea that the larger body size of B. b.
athabascae was a result of its adaptation to a forest/woodland environment.
B. athabascae is found within the boreal forests of northeastern British Columbia; northern
Alberta; northwestern Saskatchewan; the southern
and western District of Mackenzie, Yukon Territory; and the eastern half of Alaska. Its primary
range coincides with relatively extensive parklands
adjacent to the primary range of B. bison (McDonald
1981:109). The range of B.bison includes most of
the United States, western Canada, and northern
Mexico. Its primary range is within the central North
American grasslands that occur in a north-south
zone extending from Alberta and Saskatchewan
south to Texas and New Mexico (McDonald
1981: 102). However, it is their secondary range
that is most interesting. They readily dispersed into
the humid, forested eastern United States reaching
the Atlantic Coast of North Carolina around 2610
B.P., eventually inhabiting regions from Florida to
New York (McDonald 1981:263).
European encounters with bison in this region
began with the 1539-1543 expedition of Hernando
DeSoto. DeSoto first encountered bison shortly after crossing the Mississippi in the White River region of Arkansas and some of these encounters
were recorded by Elvas who was one of DeSoto's
chroniclers (Belue 1996:27). Their first sighting
was that of a half devoured buffalo in the province
of the Casqui near the White River. Among the
Pacaha Indians, not far from the Casqui, Elvas recorded how these people subsisted mainly by hunting and that they would, in a very little time, pack
up their dwellings and possessions and move to

33

another campsite. Their apparent indifference to
agriculture was explained due to the fact that "cattle"
(i.e., bison) were so common here that no field
could be protected from them (Swanton 1985:229).
Later, a more extensive sighting was recorded while
in southwestern Arkansas in a region inhabited by
Tula Indians. Here they saw piles of hides, stores of
meat, and rawhide shields (Belue 1996:27; Swanton
1985:230).
Bison populations in the East were often described as being small; however, some early chroniclers recorded seeing large numbers of "buffalo".
Large numbers of buffalo were known to inhabit
the Ohio region between the Scioto River and the
Big Bone Lick, of which thousands were ultimately
killed for their meat and hides (Belue 1996:78).
Daniel Boone was once caught in the middle of a
buffalo herd that took two hours to pass (Belue
1996: 103). Meat hunting, hide hunting, and a pure
wanton destruction of the Kentucky bison herds
began rapidly during the 1770s and finally reached
a point that even Daniel Boone had a law passed,
specifically highlighting the diminishing numbers
of "wild cattle," in an attempt to prevent the "wanton destruction of game" that was occmTing (Belue
1996:109).
Populations of bison remained east of the Mississippi until the early nineteenth century. Their
numbers were often small and at times considered
rare, but they were present in enough numbers in
some areas as to create concern when their population began to decline. Georgia even passed a law
prohibiting the hunting of buffalo in some areas in
1759. However, this measure was to no avail, as the
last buffalo in Georgia was killed in 1773. Those in
other areas quickly followed, with the last known
buffalo east of the Mississippi River being killed
by Sioux Indians around 1832 (Barsness 1985:133).
Primary barriers to dispersal include physical
barriers of water, ice, mountains, and biotic barriers such as dense forests, deserts, and true herbaceous tundra. Ice and water were a major influence
primarily during the Pleistocene expansion. Mountains, such as the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas, are
obvious barriers yet, as mentioned above, they could
be and were penetrated or circumvented. Dense
forests, such as the eastern deciduous forest and the
zonal boreal forest were the primary forests influencing southern bison dispersal and distribution.
Although bison were able to penetrate these forests, the forests made a significant impact on the

34

rate and magnitude of dispersal into those regions
(McDonald 1981:237).
Bison were obviously able to adapt to most
every type of habitat except extreme wetlands and
arid regions. Part of this adaptability is the ability
of the species to utilize a great variety of vegetation. Bison are primarily grazers adapted best to
open grasslands, but they also show extreme willingness to become browsers of woody plant foliage
and/or stems when necessary. For example, during
severe winters on the Plains bison have been observed eating willows, cottonwood, and branches
of other trees as large in diameter as a man's thumb
(Frison 1978:11). Thus, in forested regions, they
would combine grazing of available grasses with
browsing of small trees and shrubs (McDonald
1981:102, 196).
A woodland/forest opening environment contains limited resources and the usage of that environment by large terrestrial herbivores, such as bison, increases competition for sufficient resources.
Therefore, an adaptation to a dispersed browsing
strategy would permit a more flexible use of enduring woody vegetation that remain available after
most of the herbaceous vegetation is eliminated
through competitive overgrazing or by the expansion of woody vegetation. Dispersal tendencies also
enable the search for new and dispersed sources of
food, water, and space to occur when necessary. The
social cohesiveness and tolerance present on grassland environments give way in forest habitats containing limited resources, to increased individuality
or selfishness which results in a greater individual
fitness. Defense from predators would change from
one of flight to a factor of size, such as strength,
intimidation and counter attacks (McDonald
1981: 197). It is believed that these adaptations may
have been the primary factors influencing the development of the larger body size of B. b. athabascae.
Thus, a bison adaptation into a woods/forest environment can be seen not only as a successful one,
but beneficial as well.
There are some debates concerning bison movements. The question of whether they migrate or
engage in a more sedentary behavior has been highly
debated (Epp 1988:310). Migration supporters argue that bison movement patterns are seasonal rotations between geographically different vegetative
communities making up summer and winter ranges
and that these movements are often in a north-south
orientation (Morgan 1980:157).

Bison are constantly on the move for good
grazing areas. In areas having good forage they
may remain stationary for several days or weeks
before suddenly moving five to ten miles in as
many hours (Cahalane 1954:77). Frequent and periodic absences, sometimes for entire seasons, from
known ranges were also noted (Barsness 1985:20),
or they may show up in unfavorable regions in
large numbers (Roe 1951:674). Conversely, in some
regions such as a wooded environment containing
intermittent grasslands, they may remain for extended periods of time. This behavior was observed
by early Spanish explorers who noted bison in Central Texas during the summer months (Foster
1995:237), suggesting a more or less year round
residence there (Ricklis 1996:20).
Some recent studies of bison on the northern
Great Plains have provided some interesting insights into this behavior. These studies found that
bison were utilizing both grassland and woodland
environments. The findings concluded that those
bison employed a dual dispersion practice in which
some herds moved between grasslands and woodlands on a seasonal basis and other, smaller herds
remained sedentary (Epp 1988:310). Essentially,
this strategy allows for a large and numerous bovine species such as bison to exploit a number of
diverse ecological opportunities (Epp 1988:310).
Additional studies comparing historic records
on bison movements, dispersion, and foraging behavior with recent scientific studies of free ranging
and captive herds have found no contradictions.
Thus, these northern bison herds both migrated and
did not migrate (Epp 1988:314). This behavior is,
no doubt, universal within the species and, therefore, a similar behavior could be expected to occur
within southern bison populations.
Their ability to penetrate dense vegetation
was noted by many early explorers. Bison trails
were found everywhere. They were described as
having nosed into any place a man might want to
go. If he wanted to ride into the dense canebrakes
in the bottoms east of the Mississippi he could
find a buffalo trail already there. Mountain men
such as Zenas Leonard, fighting deep snow found
trails broken by buffalo, and traders often followed
buffalo trails through deep snow to save their
horses strength. Bison trails led to good river
crossings and, having gouged or cut the banks in
their crossings, allowed easy access by a horse,
and they led the way out of bottoms toward good

Dickens and Weiderhold-Bison, Texas Post Oak Savanna, and Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
feeding grounds (Barsness 1985 :2). The early
trails or traces followed by men such as Daniel
Boone were actually bison trails (Belue 1996:105108). In 1756, Mary Ingals' famous escape from
the Shawnee Indians encamped at Big Bone Lick,
Kentucky while on a salt-boiling expedition, was
accomplished by following a buffalo path (Jillson
1998:8). It is obvious from these early accounts
that bison were not inhibited from moving into or
through difficult terrain.
In sum, this brief examination of the biology
and habits of the bison has shown that the nature of
the animal is one of adaptation and survival. The
fact that they were able to inhabit most of North
America and its varied environments is a testament
to these qualities.

THE POST OAK SAVANNA

The Post Oak Savanna is best described as a
dense band of oak trees interspersed with patches
of tall grasses. This region occurs from the northeast
corner of Texas and angles southwest across the
state for approximately 300 miles, culminating in
Bexar and Gonzales counties with the majority

located east of the Trinity River. This area comprises
approximately 4,650,000 acres (General Soil Map
of Texas 1973) and includes all or portions of 37
counties. Patches of tall grasses are found
intermittently and vary considerably in size. The
larger patches of grass are often called "prairies,"
and two of the largest of these are the Fayette Prairie
and the San Antonio or String Prairie. The Fayette
Prairie is located in a northeast-southwest line in
the southern portions of Gonzales, Fayette, and
Washington counties; the northern half of DeWitt,
Lavaca, Colorado, and Austin counties; and is
bordered on the south by a smaller strip of the Post
Oak Savanna referred to here as the Southern Post
Oak Belt (Figure 1). The Fayette Prairie region is
listed as an oak savanna as opposed to a true prairie
(Frye et al. 1984; Gould et al. 1960). Both vegetative
types are classed as grasslands, but the two differ in
that a savanna contains a scattering or clumps of
trees while a prairie is treeless (Odum 1959:401).
The San Antonio or String Prairie is smaller than
the Fayette Prairie, being about five miles wide at
its maximum and almost 100 miles long. It lies
totally within the larger Northern Post Oak Belt,
and also runs in a northeast-southwest direction
beginning near Bastrop and ending just east of the

Trinity River (Jordan 1980: 19). Like the larger
Fayette Prairie, it too is actually a savanna.
Paralleling the southern edge of the Northern
Post Oak Belt is a slightly raised strip of land called
the Oakville Escarpment. It runs from Live Oak
County through Karnes County; along the county
line between Gonzales and DeWitt counties and
Gonzales and Lavaca counties; and ending at the
Brazos River in Washington and Fayette counties
(Foster 1998:40). In ecological terms, this slightly
raised strip of land is known as an edaphic climax
forest. An edaphic climax forest is defined as a vegetative community that has been modified by local
conditions of the substrate (Odum 1959:266-270)
which, in this case, is the raised landform. Technically part of the Post Oak Savanna, the variance in
the soil caused by the raised condition was not conducive to the growth of some brushy type vegetation
resulting, therefore, in a more open region.
The Vegetative Map of Texas (McMahan et.
al. 1984) defines the region as being a mosaic of
post oak woods/forest/grasslands and post oak
woods/forest. However, non-presence supporters describe the region as being composed of a dense belt
of oak trees and brush with limited access except
via "open corridors" (Ahr 1998a:30, 1998b:3-4;
Thoms and Ahr 1995:35-36). They argue further
that the open prairie/savanna portions contained
only a limited amount of forage and that this low
availability of forage would not be sufficient enough
to support bison and. coupled with the impenetrable
nature of the vegetation, the region would be an
effective barrier to large scale penetration or habitation (Ahr 1998a:30, 60).
However, a more thorough examination of the
Post Oak Savanna region reveals that it actually
contains a rather diverse environment made up of a
number of distinct vegetative zones. Two of these
vegetative zones include both a woods and forest in
their classifications. These are closely related vegetative zones with the primary difference being the
presence of a midstory in a forest classification and
no midstory in a woods classification (McMahan et
al. 1984). One of these zones is classed as a post
oak woods/forest/grassland mosaic. It consists of a
variety of vegetative communities ranging from
dense patches of woods to less dense forests to
open areas of grassland.
In addition to the post oak woods/forest/grassland zone is another vegetative zone described as a
post oak woods/forest. This region has a greater

woodland density than the previous one due to the
lack of grasslands. A characteristic of this zone is
that the oaks, in conjunction of other woody species, often develop into a "thicketized" condition
(General Soil Map of Texas 1973). These dense
thickets vary in length and intensity and, as a result
of local geographic conditions, often form fingerlike projections that jut outward into the post oak
woods/forest/ grassland zone. This description of
the post oak woods/forest zone is probably what
the non-presence supporters accepted as being representative of the region as a whole rather than only
some portions.
Three major rivers, the Colorado, Brazos, and
Trinity and an innumerable number of small streams
cross this region. The areas paralleling these streams
and rivers contain a bottomland hardwood habitat
that form a mesic forest made up of oaks, hackberries, pecans, and other trees (Blair 1950: 101 ).
The primary tree species within this region are
Post Oak (Quercus stellata), Sandjack Oak
(Quercus stellata var. margaretta), and Blackjack
Oak (Quercus marilandica). Other species include
Live Oak (Quercus virginiana), Mockernut Hickory
(Carya tomentosa), Pecan (Carya illinoensis), Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), Hackberry
(Celtis occidentalis), Cedar Elm (Ulmus crassifolia),
Mesquite (Prosopis sp.), and Hawthorn (Crataegus
sp.) (Harlow and Harrar 1958; McMahan et. al.
1984). Some of the primary shrubs include Yaupon
(flex vomitoria), Poison Oak (Toxicodendron
quercifolia), and Dewberry (Rubus sp.).
The grasses present in the patchy savanna or
"prairies" were originally tall bunchgrasses such as
Western Wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii), Silver
Bluestem (Bothriochloa saccaroides), Little
Bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Texas
Wintergrass or Needlegrass (Stipa leucotricha), and
Hairy Triden (Erioneuron pilosa) (Porter 1967;
Reeves and Bain 1947; Gould 1978), but these have
largely been replaced by herbaceous and woody,
weedy plants (Blair 1950:100; Capps 1966:5). The
roots of all these species penetrate deeply (up to 6
feet) and will weigh several times more than the
tops. These are slow growing grasses that often
take several years to mature. Little bluestem, for
example, takes three years to mature (Weaver and
Zink 1946 as cited in Odum 1959:397). Some of
the grasses, such as big bluestem and buffalo grass,
have underground rhizomes or underground stems
that grow horizontally (Porter 1967:454), while

Dickens and Weiderhold-Bison, Texas Post Oak Savanna, and Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
others, such as little bluestem and needlegrass, are
bunchgrasses and grow in clumps. The warm season species, such as Andropogon (Bluestem) and
Bouteloua (Grama grasses), begin growth in late
spring and grow continuously during summer, maturing in late summer or early autumn. This slow
growth, even when moisture and other conditions
favor rapid growth, is an excellent adaptation for
survival against heavy or intense grazing pressures
by large herbivores (Odum 1959:397-400).
The soils are within the claypan area and are
described as sandy, undulating, light-colored, and
medium to slightly acidic. The mineralogical and
chemical properties are described as being montmorillonite or mixed (Muskogee), acidic in the upper levels and alkaline to acidic in the lower portions (General Soil Map of Texas 1973).
Thus, one can derive from this discussion that
the Post Oak Savanna region is a mixed and diverse
biotic zone. It consists of a varied habitat that includes some dense "thicketized" areas with abundant open areas of varying sizes throughout. An
unknown emigrant writing of the region in 1840
provides an interesting description of the post oaks
shortly before intensive farming commenced. He
writes: "Among the uplands, in addition to the prairies, there are many considerably extensive tracts
of comparatively open timbered land, technically
called post oak lands. These are seldom dense forests, but rather resemble thickly set orchards"
(Billington 1973: 107). Therefore, it appears that
the region was not a totally impenetrable zone but
one that contains innumerable openings that would
allow for an easy access of large animals. The more
extreme "thicketized" areas would simply be circumvented when encountered. In addition, the vegetation present in the grasslands combined with
bottomland habitats would easily support large herbivores, such as bison, for extended periods of time.

BISON AND THE POST OAK
It is not known at what time bison first entered
the Post Oak Savanna region. The presence of bison on archaeological sites over the last 10,000
years has often been described as being intermittent
(Dibble 1968; Collins 1972). A study conducted by
Dillehay (1974) on bison presence and absences for
the Southern Plains found two absence periods
(6000-5000 to 2500 B.C and between A.D. 500 to

37

A.D. 1200-1300) and three presence periods, the
last beginning around A.D. 1200-1300 to A.D. 1550.
Since Bison remains have been found on the Texas
coast during the Rockport phase of the Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1250-1300) (Ricklis 1996:19-21, 35)
and along the edge of the Post Oak Savanna
(Dillehay 1974; Moore and Bradle 1997), it can be
assumed that they would have entered or were
present in the Post Oak Savanna at about the same
time as they reached the Gulf Coast of Texas. Population numbers were probably small until the onset
of the "Little Ice Age" at the end of the Late Prehistoric when conditions were more favorable for population growth and expansion.
The presence of bison within the Post Oak Savanna region is well represented during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. Local fossil
collectors commonly encounter remains of Bison
latifrons, Bison antiquus, as well as Bison bison in
the Brazos and Colorado River gravel deposits. The
Brazos Valley Museum in Bryan/College Station
contains a number of locally obtained specimens of
all these species in their collection. These too, were
primarily found in river deposits.
Texas A&M has been investigating a site on
the banks of the Brazos in Burleson County, dubbed
the Sasson site, for its discoverer. This site has
produced bison bones from a deeply buried alluvial
deposit that have been dated to the Pleistocene
(Mike Waters 1999, personal communication).
On the other hand, Late Prehistoric sites containing bison bones have been few, but there are
several located in Burleson County. Just downstream from the Sasson site, is the Buffalo Ranch
site, in which bison and bear remains were found in
the alluvial deposit of a buried Asa paleosol. These
soils were dated around 1300 to 500 B.P., placing
them within the Late Prehistoric period (Waters
and Nordt 1995:314-315).
Another site containing bison bones from the
Late Prehistoric is the Highway 21 site (41BU16)
in Burleson County. This site is also found on an
alluvial terrace of the Brazos River. The condition
of most of the faunal bones was poor, and some of
the larger specimens were identified only as being
from a large vertebrate. Those identified as bison
were assigned to both the prehistoric and Late Prehistoric/Historic periods (Roemer and Carlson
1987:109, 215, 254-258).
A single bison bone was recovered from
Winnie's Mound (41BU17) in a level at or near the

38

Texas Archeological Society

Transitional Archaic-Late Prehistoric interface. It
was also in very poor condition, and its assignment
to bison was based on its size (Bowman 1985:3974; personal communication, 1999). Additional archeological evidence for Late Prehistoric bison use
lies in the presence of some specific artifact types.
Tool assemblages often related to Late Prehistoric
bison exploitation include Perdiz arrow points,
bone-tempered and poor sand-tempered pottery,
beveled knives, and small end scrapers (Creel
1991 :42-45; Prewitt 1981 :83-84; Turner and Hester
1993:274-276; Johnson 1994). If we are to use the
argument that these artifact types are cultural indicators of a dependence upon bison, then their presence should indicate the presence of bison. As has
been discussed previously, there have been few
controlled archaeological sites conducted within the
region that were found to contain bison bone. However, one such site, mentioned above, was the Highway 21 site (41BU16). Reviewing the artifact assemblage recovered, there were a number of Perdiz
arrow points as well as some bone-tempered and
sand-tempered pottery present (Roemer and Carlson
1987:80-93). In addition, a beveled knife was found
previous to the excavation by a local amateur archaeologist (Roemer and Carlson 1987:121).
Like most regions of the country, local collectors have put a lot of pressure on the region's sites.
Within the Brazos Valley alone, untold thousands
of "arrowheads" have been collected over the years
from plowed cotton, corn, and bean fields. However, in some cases their finds can help add a little
to the known archeology of the region. One such
collection has been donated to the Brazos Valley
Museum in College Station which offers some good
information relevant to understanding the region's
lithic assemblages. It is an extensive collection that
was surface collected primarily from Grimes,
Brazos, Burleson, and Milam counties between the
late 1890s and early 1950s. Present within this collection are many hundreds of Perdiz arrow points,
some pottery, and a large number of two-beveled
and four-beveled knives (Figures 2 and 3). End
scrapers, both large and small, are also commonly
found in regional collections.
The problem is that these collections of artifacts
can only be identified as "local" finds, but their
presence does support a regional use. Therefore, we
feel the presence of some bison bone, bone-tempered and sand-tempered pottery, Perdiz arrow
points, small and large end scrapers, and beveled

knives definitely establishes that bison were present
within the Late Prehistoric Post Oak Savanna.
While the archaeological record is poor, historic
accounts of bison in the Post Oak are more abundant.
Early Spanish explorers often recorded encountering
bison within the "Monte Grande," their name for the
Post Oak Savanna region. Governor Alonso de Leon
reported encountering Tejas Indians hunting bison
near La Grange in May 1690. At that same time, de
Leon gave a horse to a Tejas Indian messenger,
intending for him to ride it. Instead, he loaded it
with bison meat he had taken in hunts between the
Colorado and Brazos rivers (Foster 1995:39-40).
Fray Espinosa recorded seeing bison east of the
Brazos (near the present day Burleson-Robertson

Dickens and Weiderhold-Bison, Texas Post Oak Savanna, and Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
county line) during Don Domingo Ramon's 1716
expedition (Foster 1995: 119). Ramon also reported
capturing two buffalo calves near the Brazos River
in Burleson County and using them in a mock
bullfight (Foster 1995: 119,237). In June 1721, Padre
Juan Antonio de la Peiia reported seeing bison as far
north as Waco, and in August 1768, Fray Solis
reported bison in eastern Fayette County and near
the Navasota River (Foster 1995:237).
Perhaps the most revealing accounts of bison
in the Post Oaks are provided in the recent translation of Henri Joutel's journal of Rene-Robert
Cavelier, Sieur de LaSalle's 1684-1687 expedition
to Texas (Foster 1998). Joutel describes numerous
large herds of bison and how the French, and local
Indians depended on the bison as well as recounting a number of hunting adventures beginning from
his stay at Fort Saint Louis until after crossing the
Navasota River.
Their first encounter with the Post Oaks was in
January 1685 in present day Lavaca County. Joutel
describes it" ... as thick as the densest brushwood
in France and found travel within it very difficult.
We would have had even more difficulty going
through if we had not found some bison trails to
follow in one direction or another" (Foster
1998: 160-161 ). In describing these trails Jou tel
writes "When one walks in the woods, one should
follow bison trails to avoid obstacles which these
animals have an instinct for bypassing" and "The
bison have, in spite of the density of the brush,
found a means to make a passage through it by
force or between two trees" (Foster 1998: 161).
Even though these trails partially were an aid
to travelers, Joutel complained that the trails often
went between two trees that were too narrow to
allow a pack horse to go between, thereby forcing
them to widen up the trail, which kept their progress
slow (Foster 1998: 161). Near LaGrange, they killed
several bison and made some "canoes" of their
hides (Foster 1998:170-173).
After crossing the Colorado, LaSalle followed
the "Oakville Escarpment" and on February 10
camped in an area that contained a lot of bison
which Jonte] noted as being unusual as they were
living in the close proximity to several bands of
Indians. In addition, the open areas in the vicinity
had recently been burned by the Indians (who used
this technique in hunting), and Joutel described
watching bison feeding on newly sprouting grass in
these burned over areas (Foster 1998:174-176).

Joutel continued to mention bison throughout
the journey until they crossed the Brazos River
near Navasota. At this point hunting began falling
off due to the presence of a heavily traveled Indian
trail and several Indian camps. However, they did
manage to kill two bison east of the Canoe (Brazos)
River on March 16 (Foster 1998:192-193) but saw
no more after leaving that camp (Foster 1998:203).
LaSalle's expedition, as recorded by Joutel,
only briefly encountered dense post oaks, and these
were primarily the South Post Oak Belt in northern
Lavaca County. After leaving these oaks they paralleled the Northern Post Oak Belt by following the
Oakville Escarpment and only occasionally entered
the denser oak forest. These dense post oaks along
this Oakville Escarpment would often open up into
small prairies or savannas. Joutel commonly refers
to Indians burning these areas as part of their buffalo hunting strategy.
Joutel' s account readily establishes the fact that
bison were observed in virtually every open area
they encountered as well as containing a great diversity of bison trails through the densest vegetation regions. The Spanish chroniclers encountering
the post oaks often recorded the difficult nature of
the region yet, like LaSalle, they also encountered
large numbers of bison. These accounts testify to
the presence of bison in the Post Oak Savanna
region during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. More recent nineteenth century accounts
show that they remained abundant until at least
1850. Accounts by early settlers mention groups of
Caddo Indians from East Texas roaming westward
through Burleson County to the Colorado River
hunting buffalo (Burleson County Historical Society 1980). In addition, Tonkawa Indians, a nomadic
people well known as buffalo hunters, were often
seen camping along streams in Central Texas, including Burleson County (Texas State Historical
Association 1996:841).
A letter written by an early settler gives an
interesting testament to the presence and overall
abundance of bison between the mouth of the Little
Brazos and Little rivers in Brazos and Milam counties. The letter was written by William DeWees on
July 16, 1822 after he and several other families
settled on the Brazos River at a point several miles
north of the mouth of the Little Brazos River.
We have no reason to fear suffering for
food as the country is literally alive with

40

all kinds of game. We have only to go
out for a few miles into the swamp between the Big and Little Brazos, to find
as many wild cattle as one could wish. If
we desire buffalo meat, we are able to go
out, load our horses, and return the same
day . . . . When we get tired of lying
around camp, we mend our moccasins,
and start up the Brazos hunting buffalo,
more for pastime than anything else. We
frequently are gone out two or three
weeks; we generally go up as high as we
dare go, on account of the Whaco Indians. You would scarcely believe me,
were I to tell you of the vast herds of
buffalo which abound here; I have frequently seen a thousand in a day between
this place, and the mouth of the Little
River. (DeWees 1968:23-28).

north of present day Waco before retracing his steps
back to the trading post and then heading west to
Austin and New Braunfels. On this trip he saw buffalo hides at a trading post called Bucksnort, located
about two miles from the Brazos River at the Falls of
the Brazos, which was about 40 miles (northwest) of
Wheelock's Settlement (10 miles from Franklin).
Here, Roemer saw Buffalo "skins" that had been
brought in by Indians. These hides were brought in
raw, tanned, and even painted on one side. He described their value as being determined by their size,
which averaged three dollars in Houston for the plain
ones and eight to ten dollars for the fancy ones
(Roemer 1983:192).
He saw his first live buffalo just after crossing
the Brazos River bottom near the Falls of the Brazos.
Roemer wrote in his journal the following description of that encounter:

In the following passage DeWees describes a
buffalo hunt:

After leaving this wooded bottom behind
us, we entered a sparse oak forest which
led us to an open, undulating prairie extending toward the north and east in an
immeasurable distance. Just before entering this prairie, we met a young Indian
who had just killed a buffalo cow and
who was engaged in loading some of the
choicest pieces of meat on his horse. He
gladly permitted us to select several
choice pieces of meat from his surplus in
exchange for a handful of salt. Under the
trees nearby we saw a buffalo calf which
had lost its mother in the cow just killed
by the Indian, running around crying pitifully (Roemer 1983:198).

In May, some six or seven of us took a
trip as high as up Little River by water. . . . On our way, we would amuse
ourselves by going out and shooting wild
cattle, which are in great abundance here.
It was dangerous for us to encamp at
night, ou the east side of the river, on
account of the cattle coming in for water,
the night being the only time they go to
water. We made our station camp at the
mouth of Little River on the beach! There
we stayed two weeks, killing and drying
buffalo meat. We went out every day,
killed a buffalo or two apiece, and
brought the choice pieces, particularly
the tongues, into camp .... When one
kills a buffalo, he generally lays claim to
the tongue, as private property, it being a
very choice piece; the other portions are
shared equally (De Wees 1968:23-28).
Another traveler through the region was
Ferdinand Roemer. He was German geologist who
traveled around Texas between 1845 and 1847 collecting fossils and recording in a journal the types of
plants, animals, geologic features, and habits of the
native Indians he encountered as he traveled. One of
his trips took him through Caldwell to Booneville,
Franklin, and a trading post on the Brazos River. He
continued up the Brazos to visit some Caddo Indians

Roemer continued his travel towards some
Caddo Indian villages located on the Brazos River
about 60 miles north of the Bucksnort trading post
(this area was within the Blackland Prairie). On the
way he reported seeing large numbers of buffalo in
herds averaging from three to four hundred (Roemer
1983:197-198).
Although most of Roemer' s account does not
speak directly of definite sightings of buffalo within
the Post Oak region proper, it is an important account in that it substantiates that there were still
large numbers of buffalo on the edge and in close
proximity to the Post Oak region as late as 1846. In
addition, he provides an interesting insight into Indian buffalo hunting practices. This and the other
historic accounts not only support the presence of

Dickens and Weiderhold-Bison, Texas Post Oak Savanna, and Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
bison within the Post oak Savanna region, but also
an obvious Indian dependence upon them as well.

THE POST OAKS AS A BARRIER?
The direction of the article, so far, has been a
discussion of the biology, habits, and nature of bison and the Post Oak region. The facts presented
were derived from biological and scientific studies
combined with historical accounts. The conclusions
of this analysis definitely supports the idea that
there were bison in the Post Oak Savanna region
and that it supported fairly large numbers during
the Late Prehistoric and early Historic periods.
Several models describing bison movements
into or through this region have been proposed (Figures 4 and 5). Huebner (1991 :353) proposed the
idea that bison moved through the Post Oaks and
onto the Coastal prairies through corridors formed
by the Brazos and Colorado rivers (Figure 4). He
felt that the southeasterly flow of these rivers would
cross-cut the various bands of oak woodlands and
savannas providing a path of "least resistance" to
the Coastal prairies. Due to the nature of the Post

41

Oak Savanna and its bottomlands, it is doubtful that
this would be a path of least resistance, but the idea
that bison would have moved along some of the
river "corridors" utilizing bottomlands, as well as
uplands, is perfectly acceptable.
Ahr (1998a:30, 60), however, disagrees with
Huebner on the assumption that bison were solely
grazers, as opposed to browsers. He argues that the
Post Oak Savanna is a marginal habitat because it
contains a low density of grasses and that such
areas are unsuitable for large numbers of bison.
The adjoining region, the Blackland Prairie, would
be more suitable for bison habitation and movements because it contains a higher density of the
more important grasses, such as little bluestem, Indian grass, buffalo grass, and switch grass. The
result is that the Post Oak Savanna would serve as a
moderately effective barrier to bison movements
forcing them to migrate along its edge with the
Blackland Prairie (Figure 5).
Ahr seems to have failed to consider several
important factors. One is that bison easily adapt to a
browsing strategy which is supported by northern
bison studies that showed how bison readily adapted
to forest/woodland habitats as well as adopting a

browsing strategy on the Plains during periods of
severe conditions. This ability at adaptation enabled
bison to expand their range to the East Coast and it
is difficult to believe that they would have done so
had they relied solely upon a grazing strategy.
Another point Ahr overlooked is the nature of
the Post Oak Savanna. By definition, it is a region
made up of a mosaic of oak woods and savannas.
These "savannas" varied greatly in size and number, and while most were encompassed within oak
woods, some would have opened onto surrounding regions such as the Blackland Prairie. Also,
the grasses found on these savannas were the same
grass species found on the Blackland Prairie but
in less quantity. It is evident that some of these
grasses, such as the little bluestem, have adapted
to overgrazing conditions by developing a slow,
but continual growing season, maturing in late
Summer or Fall. This adaptation results in a constant production of new growth throughout spring
and summer.
Thus, by combining small woody vegetation
from forest margins (and bottomland habitats) with
available grasses, the region easily would have

supported fairly large numbers of bison. That it
did is supported by accounts of early explorers
and settlers who recorded seeing thousands of bison, as well as large numbers of wild cattle, within
the region.
In addition, Indian hunters, whether knowingly
or not, improved this habitat through the burning of
these savannas. Joutel recorded that the Indians
frequently burned open areas throughout the Post
oak region to move bison from one area to another
as part of their hunting strategy. This procedure
would result in the enlarging and/or keeping the
areas open, as well as stimulating new vegetative
growth. In short, the Indians were practicing a type
of game management.
It has been demonstrated that bison easily
moved into the Post Oak Savanna region and often
remained there the year round. However, this is not
to say they did not also follow the Blackland Prairie
south, as Ahr suggests. The surrounding prairies
were more suitable for the movements of large
herds, and most of these animals probably never
entered or came in contact with the Post Oak
Savanna, preferring to stay on the more open plains.

Some, though, took advantage of the diverse habitats
available, not only within the Post Oak Savanna,
but especially the biotic zones along the margins
between it, the Blackland Prairie, and/or bottomland
habitats. Thus, bison presence along the Post Oak
Savanna/Blackland Prairie boundary and within the
Post Oaks proper can be seen as more or less a
permanent habitat for some, as well as an avenue
for north-south movements of others.
The idea that the Post Oak vegetation would
inhibit movement due to its density or be restricted
to river systems is also rejected by both biological
studies and historical accounts. An excellent example was the account provided by Joutel during
La Salle's 1684-1687 expedition, in which he described their first meeting with the Post Oaks (the
Southern Belt) as being extremely difficult and that
the best way to move through those woods was by
following bison trails (Foster 1998:161).
In summary, the Post Oak Savanna would not
have been a major barrier. Although major movements of bison would have utilized the more open
prairies, smaller numbers also moved into and
through the Post Oak Savanna (Figure 6). Their

numbers would have been dispersed by the nature
of the woods/forest environment, but with the diverse habitats afforded them within the region, they
would have been able to find good forage for year
round habitation. Although the facts and arguments
presented thus far have supported the presence of
bison in the Post Oak Savanna region, it still does
not answer the question of why there are so few
bison remains found in the regions Late Prehistoric
sites. The next portion of the paper will discuss
possible reasons for this.

PREHISTORIC HUNTING
STRATEGIES
In order to make an argument for hunting practices as a causal factor for the lack of bison remains
in the Texas Post Oak Savanna, it would be well to
briefly examine some examples of large game procurement at other locations in space and time to
determine what effect procurement methods might
have on faunal assemblages and to relate these methods to those we project for the Post Oaks.

44

Texas Archeological Society

We will begin the discussion in what is
considered to be the primary habitat of B. bison
bison, namely the Great Plains. Bison hunting
strategies on the Great Plains are well documented
from as far back as Paleoindian times and are
generally manifested in the archaeological record
as products of communal hunts that involved tens
to upward of a hundred animals in a particular kill
episode (Bement 1999; Buehler 1997; Frison 1978;
Wheat 1972). Generally speaking, jump kill sites
were prevalent on the Northern Plains while arroyo
trap kill sites predominated in the Southern Plains.
This difference is attributed to the nature of the
topography of the two regions (Buehler 1997).
Campsites were often in close proximity to kill
sites in order to quickly and efficiently process this
perishable resource. Bison remains in these types
of sites are abundant and as such, are readily visible
in the archaeological record.

dispatch a single bison if the hunting weapon was a
bow and arrow. Although the bow and arrow would
not necessarily preclude communal hunts, it would,
however, make it possible to accomplish a kill in a
single chance encounter (Wheat 1972:91-96).
Unless the kill was made close enough to camp
for others to participate in butchering, the movement of meat, bones, and hide from a kill to a
campsite would be costly in terms of labor and
moving a campsite to a kill would involve costs as
well. The choice would largely be determined by
the size of the kill and, if a single animal were
involved, the cost effective choice may well have
been to transport the carcass to the campsite. Selection of only certain parts for transport or changes in
methods of transport (such as acquisition of horses)
might further prompt a decision to move the carcass to the campsite (Roper 1992).

Post Oak Savanna Versus Southern Plains
Post-Archaic Southern Plains
In the periods following the Archaic, it seems
that, except for the Garnsey site (Speth and Parry
1980) and a few small kills of one or two animals
(Brooks and Flynn 1988), there is a paucity of kill
sites in the Southern Plains, although bison remains
are present at occupation sites during these times.
Buehler (1997: 176) posits two reasons for this: (1)
the processing of bones for grease and (2) an increase in the use of bison skeletal elements for
horticultural tools, both of which he argues would
render kill sites less visible and/or recognizable in
the archaeological record than kill sites from previous periods. Although Buehler states that the lack
of kill sites makes inferences about hunting techniques impossible, we suggest that this change in
faunal assemblage patterns reflects a very significant change in hunting technology and practice such
as a shift to a dependence on the bow and arrow as
the primary hunting weapon.
Killing bison with spear or dart points thrown
by hand or with an atlatl would be done with greater
certainty of success if the animals were in a compact group at close range with nowhere to run (such
as an arroyo trap), than would be the case if the
object of the kill was a single bison with plenty of
room to run. Kill episodes of the type commonly
found in the Southern Plains in Paleoindian and
Archaic times presuppose a fair amount of organization. On the other hand, it would be easier to

If the above line of reasoning is valid for the
Southern Plains, it might also be used to explain the
paucity of bison remains in a more peripheral region such as the Post Oak Savanna even though
there are differences between the two regions. First
of all, the topography of the Post Oak Savanna
would have been a deterrent to the taking of bison
in large communal kills typical of the Plains. In a
woods/forest environment interspersed with open
areas of grassland, bison would only be able to
congregate in the prairie areas and preventing their
dispersal into the surrounding woods would be
troublesome at the least. In the more wooded areas
groups would necessarily be smaller, perhaps only
a few animals or even a cow-calf pair as described
by Roemer (1983:198). It would be difficult indeed
to assemble bison into a close, compact group even
with the aid of corrals (see Speth and Parry [1980]
for the possible use of corrals at the Garnsey site)
and, for that matter, horses, as anyone who has
gathered unruly cattle in the Post Oaks knows well.
The use of the bow and arrow in the Post Oak
Savanna would, moreover, make group kills unnecessary for the same reasons discussed above with
respect to the Southern Plains.
Although the topography of the region precluded taking advantage of the bison's herding instincts in order to coerce them into traps for immediate slaughter en masse, it should not be supposed
that the prehistoric people of the Post Oaks had no

Dickens and Weiderhold-Bison, Texas Post Oak Savanna, and Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
recourse but chance encounters with a bow and
arrow in obtaining their meat. As mentioned earlier, woodland Indians were practicing a type of
game management that was more than likely common throughout eastern North America. In fact,
DeVivo (1990:308) argues that fire was the primary tool with which Indians controlled their environment. Fire was used to clear the land for agriculture, the results of which were witnessed by the
DeSoto expedition (1538-1543) in the form oflarge
maize fields, canebrakes, and open land on the
southeastern coastal plains and in the southern
mountains. Indians rid themselves of unwanted plant
species while stimulating the growth of those that
were of value through the use of fire. The periodic
burning maintained canebrakes, and it has been
reported that after pioneer settlement began in the
Asheville Basin within the Cherokee lands, the use
of fire ceased and, coupled with uncontrolled grazing, the vast canebrakes located there began to degenerate (De Vivo 1990:308).
When it was not desirable to clear land completely for agriculture, underbrnsh was burned to
create and maintain prairie areas within the forest.
This not only encouraged the growth of grasses, but
in addition stimulated the rejuvenation of the burned
underbrush to a tender and more palatable fonn better suited for utilization by browsing animals, while
also increasing visibility in an otherwise thick forest.
These changes in vegetation, in turn, encouraged the
presence of game animals such as bison and deer
and, along with continued periodic burning, enhanced
the Indian's control of their movements, both long
and short term. Long term movement could be likened to a change in pasturage, while short term movements could set up an ambush to facilitate killing
(Belue 1999; De Vivo 1990).
To sum up thus far, there should be little reason to expect to find bison remains in kill sites
reflecting communal hunts typical of the Plains in
the Post Oak Savanna of the Late Prehistoric period. This is born out in the accounts of Joutel and
the various Spanish chroniclers who often described
only one or two Indians in a hunting encounter
(Foster 1995, 1998). A good example of this was
recorded by Joutel who described an incident involving a single Indian hunting a bison shortly after
crossing. the Colorado River in Fayette County on
February 1, 1687. "The Indian had previously
wounded the bison and was trailing it. The animal,
somewhat provoked, would run after the Indian

45

who would, in turn, follow after the bison. This
back and forth game continued for some time until
the Indian gave up" (Foster 1998:168). Although
this account is rather amusing, the incident lends
support to a single hunter hunting strategy.
We must now address a second difference between the two regions regarding bison remains,
namely the differing amounts of bison remains in
occupation sites. Buehler (1997) reports that although numbers of kill sites are generally diminished in the Southern Plains in post-Archaic times,
bison bone is still present in campsites. In the Post
Oak Savanna, there is not only a dearth of kill sites,
but also a scarcity of bison bone from known campsites. Therefore, bison presence in this region in the
Late Prehistoric requires further explanation.
Buehler (1997) states that bison bone present
in occupation sites is often in the form of horticultural tools and numerous small fragments thought
to have been broken for the extraction of bone
grease. Other scholars have also noted quantities of
bone chips believed to have been used in grease
manufacture in the Southern Plains such as Garza
complex occupations, Antelope Creek phase sites,
and other sites in northern Texas, as well as in
Toyah phase components in west central and central Texas (Quigg 1998).
In an area such as the Post Oak Savanna, however, it is quite possible that grease may have been
procured from other sources less labor intensive
than extracting it from bison bone. Other important
fauna of the region included bear (Smith 1995: 12,
93), raccoon, and beaver, all of which carry a significantly high proportion of fat known both ethnographically and experimentally to yield a correspondingly high amount of oil or grease of excellent quality. For example, after European contact
bear oil was in great demand as it had a wide array
of uses ranging from cooking to oiling the bore of a
rifle and was a primary trade item in Nacogdoches
during the 1830s (Yantis 1984:12; Smith 1995:93).
It was reported that one bear could yield from 75 to
100 pounds of grease (Berlandier 1969; Blair 1950;
Roemer 1983:232). These animals were very common, and grease from them could be obtained
through routine butchering processes with a minimal amount of effort. Therefore, one would expect
that Late Prehistoric peoples of the Post Oaks may
well have used them as a source of grease or oil
rather than acquiring it through the more tedious
method by the breaking and boiling of bison bone.

46

Texas Archeological Society

Because of its abundance and workability,
wood might also have been used for the manufacture of horticultural and other tools (Newcomb
1961 :293) that Plains people made from bison bone
or, if a bone tool was required, a deer bone may
have sufficed. In sum, bison bone may not be
present at occupation sites because it was not
needed for the products that Buehler cites. If the
bone from a particular bison kill was not needed
in and of itself, it may have simply been left where
it fell, thereby assigning it a low visibility in the
archaeological record. However, bone that would
have been transported back to camp along with
the meat is quite another issue and one that has
been debated extensively and has likewise been
the subject of numerous studies, both archaeological and ethnographic. We will briefly focus here
on only a few of these.

The Hadza
If we can allow ourselves to suppose that the
behavior of modern hunter-gathers is at least relevant to that of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, then
some further insights might be gained from a brief
review of an ethnographic account of Eastern
Hadza hunting practices. The Eastern Hadza occupy a region of northern Tanzania where the vegetation is described as being "primarily mixed savanna woodland" and where "medium/large game
animals are locally abundant" (O'Connell et al.
1988:115). As of 1988, they were still occupied as
full-time hunter-gatherers, hunting the animals that
make up their prey with only a bow and arrows,
the tips of which are sometimes poisoned. The
Hadza practice two types of hunting: (1) intercept
hunting, where the prey animal is shot from blinds
near water sources (utilized mainly in the dry season) and (2) encounter hunting, which is simply
making opportunistic visual contact with a prey
animal anytime the perpetually armed men leave
camp(O'Connelletal.1988:117). They also scavenge the kills of other predators.
The authors provide quantitative data on bone
transport for 39 butchering episodes (O'Connell et
al. 1988:150-155) where the prey ranged in size
from impala averaging 40 kg in weight to giraffe
averaging 670 kg. Falling between these extremes
and most often obtained are warthog, alcelaphine
antelope, zebra, and eland. The data obtained for
these occurrences suggest several interesting

parallels to practices and strategies projected for
hunting in the Post Oak Savanna during the Late
Prehistoric. Incidentally, the average weight range
for B. bison (Davis and Schmidly 1994:28) would
include that given by O'Connell et al. (1988:Figure
4) for giraffe. Treatment of carcasses by the Hadza
varied across species in the order of selection of
elements for transport and the number of elements
selected from individual carcasses. In addition, the
authors observed that some bones were stripped of
meat and marrow which was consumed in the field
during the butchering process. The type and number
of these also varied across species.
Apropos of the point of the present study, the
most striking variations in carcass treatment occurred between the two largest species (giraffe and
eland) and the remainder of the prey species. Giraffe and eland provided the only cases where a
substantial amount of meat was left at the kill/
butchering site. The larger animals killed at greater
distances from camp accounted for most of the low
numbers of skeletal elements transported. For giraffe, no more than 20% of the elements in any
given category were removed in five cases, and, in
four out of five cases, no bones were removed. In
contrast, zebra and alcelaphine antelope averaged
70% of the bone transported (O'Connell et al.
1988:150-155). Giraffe and eland were taken at
greater distances from the base camp than the rest
of the prey species. The larger animals averaged a
2.5 hour walk from camp as opposed to 20-45 minutes for the other species (O'Connell et al. 1988:Figure 5). The authors explain that "larger animals
shot at greater distances from camp are more likely
to be pursued, and that larger animals wherever
shot are likely to be pursued further, simply because the potential returns from doing so are much
greater" (O'Connell et al. 1988: 130).
The authors also note that butchering often
takes place under time constraints due to such
factors as approaching sundown, the distance from
camp, or the distance of the kill site from water. It
becomes clear that the larger the game animal and
the greater the distance from camp, the greater
will be the incentive to more efficiently transport
meat from the larger animals, especially when the
situation is complicated by the constraints of time.
The kill sites or butchering sites are generally
used only once and are described by the authors as
"places where animals are killed or scavenged are
disarticulated for transport to a residential base"

Dickens and Weiderhold-Bison, Texas Post Oak Savanna, and Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
and were noted as occurring "in stream channels,
on hillsides, in grassy swales, and along ridgesin short, wherever the animal in question finally
succumbed" (O'Connell et al. 1988:140). These
sites are thus rendered less visible in the archaeological record than occupation sites because they
are not used repeatedly and there is no pattern to
their location.
Earlier Studies of Bone Transport
Archaeologists have long been interested in the
variable frequencies of different skeletal elements
in faunal assemblages. Previous studies have been
conducted in which this variation is attributed to
differential transport. Three of these are cited by
O'Connell et al. (1988) and deserve mention here.
First of all, in working with North American Plains
assemblages, T.E. White (1952, 1953, 1954) inferred that larger carcasses were likely to be stripped
of meat at the kill site in order to reduce the cost of
transporting bone, and that limbs were the most
likely elements to be moved because they possessed
a high meat to bone ratio. Similar is Perkins and
Daly's (1968) model of bone transport based on
their faunal analysis of a Neolithic site in Turkey
which exhibited a disparity between the number of
cattle foot bones and the number of leg bones. They
reasoned that this was because the former were left
attached to the hide while the latter were thrown
away, again presumably to reduce weight. They
dubbed this disparity the "schlepp effect." A third
study discussed by O'Connell et al. (1988) is
Binford's (1978) model of the Nunamiut, which
asserts that generally the more meat, marrow, and
grease attached to a bone, the more likely it is for
that bone to be transported.
As stated by O'Connell et al. (1988), the Hadza
data contradict these previous studies in particular
details concerning primarily which elements are
transported and which are left. What is important,
however, is that they conclude that, in spite of the
differences in carcass treatment patterns demonstrated by the studies discussed above, they all
reflect the maximization of net nutritional benefit
relative to processing and transport costs. Furthermore, differences in treatment patterns reflect
different conditions of carcass acquisition. For
example, carcasses are taken in groups of up to 60
individuals by the Nunamiut and are largely destined
for storage, whereas the Hadza acquire carcasses

47

one at a time for immediate use (O'Connell et al.
1988: 143-144). We infer the latter type of
acquisition and its corresponding type of treatment
for hunting in the Late Prehistoric Post Oak
Savanna, based on the evidence presented thus far.
Additional support for this bison hunting and processing strategy comes from studies of Mississippian sites in woodland parts of North America not
generally considered to be "prime" bison habitat.
For example, it is reported that both deer and bison
were killed in the forest near the Vista Rock Shelter
(23SR20) in the Ozark highlands of southwestern
Missouri (O'Brien 1978). O'Brien attributes the
rarity of animal bone in habitation sites to the practice of butchering the animals where they fell.
In Caddoan sites within the Arkansas River
drainage region of eastern Oklahoma, faunal analysis led Brown et al. (1978) to conclude that bison
hunting was a long-range activity where meat,
containing only a minimal amount of bone, was
transported from hunts in the west to the easternmost settlements. The idea of long range hunting
is supported by Smith (1995: 12-13) who describes
Texas Caddo Indians hunting bison during the winter with stone tipped arrows but had to travel a
considerable distance to the west in the vicinity of
the Brazos and Navasota rivers to find them. Smith
(1995:13) adds that they only had dogs for pack
animals which limited the amount of meat carried
back to their villages.
An account by Simars de Bellisle, a young
French officer abandoned by his shipmates while
filling water casks on Galveston Island in 1719,
and subsequently captured by a group of Akosisas
Indians provides some insight into the amounts of
meat taken during a buffalo hunt. In his account
(Folmer 1940:216-214), Bellisle describes a buffalo hunt in which the men from his and another
band traveled three days to a prairie covered with
bison where they killed fifteen or sixteen of them
with their bows and arrows. They apparently took
little meat as Bellisle recounted that within four
days they were again searching for food.
A similar account supporting this strategy
for the Southern Plains during the late nineteenth
century is provided by Barsness (1985 :66). He
describes the technique of Indian butchering thus
in the following. "As of old, they severed the
meat from the bones to reduce the weight to be
carried back to camp. Such butchering white men
called 'Indian Fashion' and complained that it

48

Texas Archeological Society

may do on the prairies but a good deal of meat is
lost in this manner."
A situation also exists in the Florida Panhandle
that is very much like the circumstances in the
Texas Post Oak Savanna for about the same time
period. It is generally believed that bison were
present in Florida as "small unobserved groups" at
least as early as DeSoto's time but DeSoto and
other Spanish explorers did not mention them (Belue
1996:28). There is, however, some documentation
for the presence of bison from the late sixteenth to
very early eighteenth century, but bison remains
have not been reported from any known Late Prehistoric site (Brose and Percy 1978:86).

THE LACK OF BISON BONE IN
THE LATE PREHISTORIC
POST OAK SAVANNA
The aforementioned situation appears paradoxical at first glance. As we have shown, historical
documentation, bison ecology, and the structure and
ecology of the Post Oak Savanna region places
them there, and yet there is only minimal faunal
evidence of their presence, even at sites dating
within the last few centuries. This issue has elicited
various explanations.
Several reasons could account for the scarcity
of bison bones in Late Prehistoric sites. One is the
problem of relatively poor bone preservation within
the region. Faunal preservation throughout the region is considered to be poor and is represented
mostly by burned and small unburned fragments
(Thoms 1993: 13). Animals identified by these fragments are usually deer and smaller sized mammals,
birds, and fish. Although some bison material has
been identified (Roemer and Carlson 1987: 109),
most large bones can only be placed in a large
vertebrate category.
Another explanation for the lack of bison bone,
as well as other faunal remains, may be site location. Those sites that do contain faunal material are
usually located on low (floodplain) terraces and
valley margins (Huebner 1991:348), such as
41BU16 (Highway 21 site). However, the settlement patterns of Late Prehistoric peoples probably
play a major role in faunal absence. Several good
accounts by Joutel (Foster 1998: 172, 174,183-184)
describes the dependency upon bison by the Indians he encountered, and that these groups were

highly mobile, staying at a particular site only as
long as there was food, i.e. bison, in the vicinity.
He also noted their reluctance to stay long in any
area was also due to a fear of being attacked by
other enemy groups. Another observation of the
constant mobility of some groups was DeSoto's
chronicler Elvas' description of the Pacaha Indians
in eastern Arkansas (Swanton 1985:229).
The strategy for short term occupancy is supported by archaeological evidence that includes numerous lithic scatter sites, of various sizes, found in
the region's upland settings (Dickens 1993a, 1993b;
1995; Ensor 1987; Kotter 1982). Such sites having
limited, short term occupations do not lead to the
production of large midden deposits usually necessary for faunal preservation. In addition, the soils
of the Post Oak Savanna, especially upland soils,
are composed of well drained, slightly acidic undulating sands, and these do not provide good conditions for faunal preservation. Although the lack of
faunal preservation has some merit, it is still an
inadequate explanation because the remains of other
species, whose bones are less dense and should
thus be less well preserved than bison, make up the
majority of faunal material from sites that do contain such.
Another theory for the lack of bison bone in the
Post Oak Savanna centers on the idea that deer
were the more important resource (Thoms 1993,
1994). The fact that deer bone has been found commonly within regional Late Prehistoric sites suggested to Thoms that these animals were utilized
more frequently than bison and as such were the
more important resource. Thoms (1993: 13-14,
1994:17-20) utilized modern deer density and population studies as well as a few ethnohistoric accounts of hide use to support this argument. There
is no question deer were an important resource and
one that was probably harvested on a regular basis.
However, Joutel recorded that the Indian groups he
encountered from the time they left Fort St. Louis
were constantly hunting bison and that many were
involved in the hide trade. This does not support a
low dependence strategy.
It is also argued that human predation prior to
the depopulation caused by European diseases kept
bison out of the Post Oaks, and that the resulting
lack of hunting pressure after AD. 1500 coupled
with favorable climatic changes brought about by
the Little Ice Age, allowed bison to inhabit the
region and others like it throughout the southeast

Dickens and Weiderhold-Bison, Texas Post Oak Savanna, and Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
(Ahr 1998b; DeVivo 1990; Thoms 1993). Recent
research leaves little doubt that epidemic diseases
brought about through European contact devastated
native populations. What is not yet clear is the
means, the manner, and the rate at which these
diseases spread, and the extent to which they affected a particular region.
Dobyns ( 1983) postulates a smallpox pandemic
that began in 1518 in Santo Domingo and was
carried to Mexico by Cortez and his entourage.
There it devastated the native population, and, according to Dobyns, ultimately destroyed millions
of people throughout the New World. While this
occurrence was widely catastrophic, it is doubtful
that it was pandemic in every part of Americas.
Other sixteenth century epidemics originating in
Mexico are well documented, but current evidence
suggests that these epidemics did not spread northward (Snow and Lanphear 1988). Populations north
of Mexico were sparse by comparison, and geographical buffer zones existed between some populations. The spread of epidemic diseases from other
possible sources (e.g. Cabeza de Vaca or the
DeSoto/Moscoso expeditions) that were introduced
to these populations depended on several factors in
addition to the presence of buffer zones. These
factors include the size of the infected population
and those surrounding it, the length of common
territorial boundaries, the depth of the buffer zones,
levels of interaction, and chance (Snow and
Lanphear 1988: 17). Therefore, keeping these factors in mind and studying the historical records,
one can conclude that there is a general lack of
evidence for a massive human population reduction
in the sixteenth century for the Post Oak Savanna
region (Dobyns 1983; Ewers 1973; Snow and
Laphear 1988).
Conversely, there is evidence from the late seventeenth century journal of Henri Joutel (Foster
1998) for a significant human population in the
region. In February of 1687, Joutel conversed with
two unidentified Indians near the Colorado River
crossing in Fayette County a few leagues south of
the "great forest." The Indians named approximately
forty tribes, both friend and foe, that Joutel listed in
his journal (Foster 1998: 171-172). Joutel also noted
a temporary scarcity of bison in the region and was
told by his informants that this was due to the large
number of Indians there. "For this reason they (Indians) disperse in order to subsist better, and they
drive the bison back and forth to each other. It

49

seemed from this that the woods and rivers are their
boundaries for hunting" (Foster 1998: 172).
LaSalle' s company crossed the river and began
the march toward the Brazos which would also take
them through some portions of the densely wooded
areas of the Post Oak Savanna about four leagues
farther on according to Joutel accounts.
The bison were found in rather large
numbers, which was surprising, in the
middle of several bands of people who
roamed in these areas. In addition, the
grass was burned and almost none had
appeared. But these animals seem to delight in searching for the small sprigs of
grass just appearing to sprout. We stayed
there for two days; during that time we
killed several bison which we smoked
for our provision (Foster 1998:174).
Farther on toward the Brazos, after working
through dense woods for about half a day, the
Frenchman stopped and Joutel records what they
saw in his diary, " ... we arrived in a very pretty
prairie where we noticed a great many tracks of
men who must have passed through there the same
day. We also spotted two smoke plumes that appeared to be very close, one to the northeast and the
other to the southwest" (Foster 1998:175). Joutel
continues by stating that, "Bison were not abundant
in this area, the natives who had set fire to the grass
had scattered them. Besides, Indians had hunted
there for some time" (Foster 1998: 176).
Examples such as these occur throughout the
journal, both within and outside the Post Oaks
proper. It is quite evident then that both bison and
humans were present in substantial numbers in the
late seventeenth century. This evidence suggests
that there was no massive human depopulation in
the Post Oak Savanna in the sixteenth century allowing bison to enter (see Ricklis [1996] for a similar conclusion in his study of the Karankawas).
There is another possible reason, not discussed
heretofore, that Indians of the Post Oaks would not
have transported bone back to camp. This reason
concerns meat preservation. Throughout his journal,
Joutel relates that Indians smoked meat at the kill
sites before taking it back to camp, a process that
the French were quick to adopt. Smoking the meat
immediately subsequent to butchering would, of
course, prevent spoilage in a humid environment
such as the Post Oak Savanna. Prevention of

SO

Texas Archeological Society

spoilage would be a prime consideration for people
traveling through, like the French, or for Indians
moving to a base camp some distance away from a
kill, especially if they were carrying more meat than
would be immediately consumed by their group. A
cut of meat smoked "bone-in" is more likely to spoil
than the same cut smoked boneless. If Indians of the
Post Oak Savanna were cognizant of this difference,
they would have all the more reason to separate the
meat from the bone at the kill site.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In the light of the evidence for the presence of
bison in the region from the beginning of the Late
Prehistoric, as well as evidence for the presence of
a significant number of people, we reiterate that the
most tenable explanation for a lack of bison bone in
archaeological sites may well be related to the procurement strategies of the people who hunted there.
This section will summarize the evidence and formulate a bison procurement strategy modeled for
the region that should satisfactorily explain the paucity of bison remains.
First of all; climatic conditions changed early
in the Late Prehistoric, allowing for an expansion
of bison into habitats adjoining the Plains, such as
the Post Oak Savanna. Thus, people inhabiting the
region would have been able to utilize a Plains
resource as well as the resources common to woodland environments. In addition, there is evidence
suggesting that many people utilized the region
without permanently residing there (Foster 1995,
1998) Secondly; the bow and arrow came to be the
primary weapon for hunting (Turner and Hester
1993), and (as previously discussed) this weapon
would have facilitated animal procurement in a forested environment where large communal kills
would be difficult. The need for entrapping the
animals, moving a camp to a kill site and other
highly organized activities requiring the coordinated
efforts of large groups would be reduced. Large
communal hunts are not indicated by the documented accounts. Instead, one or two hunters are
generally seen. Joutel' s journal does seem to indicate that there was perhaps a mutual agreement
between tribes and/or groups of people concerning
bison hunting and the use of fire in driving the
animals back and forth from one open area to another. Also noted was the use of dogs, perhaps

either to cut an animal out of a group or to hold one
or more animals at bay (Foster 1995, 1998:172174, 181).
Like the Hadza, the people of the Post Oaks
would have practiced opportunistic visual encounter hunting, but intercept hunting also came
into play to the extent that bison location could
be predicted through the purposeful use of fire in
forcing the movements of the animals through
known avenues (bison trails) or to selected areas.
Methods of carcass acquisition would have been
broadly similar to Hadza methods as would methods of carcass treatment. Joutel gives evidence
that the indians probably often worked under time
constraints much like the Hadza. In addition to
factors such as approaching darkness or distances
from water mentioned by O'Connell et al. (1988),
territorial boundaries and the proximity of enemies would impose time constraints as well
(Foster 1998:171-172, 183-184). Deer-size and
smaller carcasses would have been transported to
the campsite largely intact to be butchered there,
while bison would have been butchered where
they fell with little or no bone transported, since
the transport of bone would be costly in terms of
labor and time.
In addition, bison bone would not have been
transported back to camp because it likely was not
needed for tools or grease. As discussed above, these
items could be obtained more easily utilizing other
fat-bearing animals and the substitution of wood for
tools normally thought to be made from bone.
In conclusion, the picture that emerges for bison
procurement in the Late Prehistoric Post Oak
Savanna is one of a growing dependence upon bison
that had increased with the rapid expansion of bison
populations after A.D. 1500. Bison procurement
strategy was composed of various peoples that
hunted singly or in very small groups. Prey was
generally located on an opportunistic basis and
obtained at a rate of one or two animals at a time.
Any deer-sized or smaller prey obtained would be
taken to the base camp complete. However, if the
prey animal was a bison, the carcass would have
been butchered at the kill site in such a way that its
bones were not transported back to camp. Thus,
these single-use kill sites would leave little evidence
on the landscape and, as such, would not enter the
archaeological record of most Late Prehistoric sites
in the Post Oak Savanna of Texas. Lastly, the
paucity of bison bone is partly due to the paucity of

Dickens and Weiderhold-Bison, Texas Post Oak Savanna, and Late Prehistoric Period of Texas
the archeology of regional late Prehistoric sites and
we predict that when these sites are dug, some
traces of bison will be found.

The Toyah Bluff Site (41TV441)-Changing Notions of
Late Prehistoric Subsistence in the Blackland Prairie Along
the Eastern Edge of the Edwards Plateau,
Travis County, Texas
James Karbula

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company conducted archeological testing and data recovery at a Late Prehistoric site (41TV441)
at the proposed location of Southeast Metropolitan Park in Travis County, Texas. A total of 54 shovel tests, 34
backhoe trenches and two open area blocks were excavated during the data recovery. The investigations
documented an extensive Late Prehistoric occupation site spanning the transition period between the Austin and
Toyah intervals in Texas prehistory. Site chronology indicates an occupation from approximately A.D. 1235 to
1425. Site data may suggest the association of Toyah peoples in the Blackland Prairie with plant food processing
as early as A.D. 1235. The report focuses on possible implications of these data on the transition period between
the Austin and Toyah intervals.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the Travis County Transportation
and Natural Resources Department (TNR) and
HNTB Engineering Inc., Hicks & Company (H&C)
conducted testing and data recovery of a Late Prehistoric site (41TV441) in Travis County, Texas.
The site is the location of Travis County's proposed Southeast Metropolitan Park. The project fulfilled TNR's responsibilities under Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (1966, as
amended) and the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC)
relative to the development of park infrastructure.
The project falls under Section 106 because of the
use of federally assisted matching grant funds. The
work occurred under Texas Antiquities Code Permits 2018 and 2074.
Southeast Metropolitan Park is located approximately 20 miles southeast of the City of
Austin, adjacent to SH 71, in southeast Travis
County, Texas (Figure 1). The site is located in
the Blackland Prairie approximately 20 kilometers east of the Balcones Escarpment fault zone
and the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau.
Southeast Metropolitan Park covers roughly 300
acres located between SH 71 on the south end
and a branch of Onion Creek located to the north.

The western and northern boundary of the park is
formed by Onion Creek. The site is located on a
high terrace that overlooks the creek to the west,
within 200 meters of the SH 71 roadway (Figure
2). The scarp forming the terrace measures approximately 15 meters in height affording a commanding view of surrounding countryside. This
includes a view of the Austin metropolitan skyline some 20 miles to the west.
The Toyah Bluff site terrace is relatively flat but
to the north is a series of high, rugged, steep hills.
The hills are heavily dissected and represent very
rough topography. On the east edge of the terrace
containing the site is the remnants of an ephemeral
drainage. This drainage moves water runoff from the
hills to the southeast area of the park. In modern
times, such runoff results in ponds and marshy areas.
Thus, the flat terrace area of the site was strategically
situated on top of the bluff overlooking Onion Creek,
west of the ephemeral drainage and marshy areas,
and south of the high, eroded hills.
The site is divided into eastern and western
halves by a gravel driveway. The eastern flank gently slopes down to the edges of the tiny drainage.
The drainage at times provided some deposition of
sandy sediments to the site's eastern flank. The
archeological deposits are slightly deeper in this

THE TOYAH INTERVAL
The Toyah interval (after Ricklis and Collins
1994) stands out as one of the best documented and
presumably well understood of the prehistoric culture-historical time periods in central and adjacent
regions of Texas. Among the reasons for this are
the large numbers of documented Toyah sites many
of which represent short lived, isolated occupations
with distinctive lithic and ceramic assemblages
(Black 1986; Johnson 1994; Quigg and Peck 1995;
Ricklis and Collins 1994). The distinctive nature of
these assemblages was first recognized as the Toyah
focus of the Central Texas Aspect (Kelley 1947;
Suhm et al. 1954). Toyah assemblages consisted
primarily of Perdiz arrow points and bone tempered pottery. Subsequent studies elaborated on the
material culture and/or related behavioral implications of Toyah sites and assemblages (Jelks 1962)
and recognized its widespread nature across Texas
(Black 1982).
Prewitt (1981, 1985) assimilated and integrated
much of the extant Toyah data and redefined the
Toyah as a "phase" utilizing the Midwestern
Taxonomic System. The Toyah were associated
with a consistent, highly variable artifact assemblage
confined to a discrete segment of the prehistoric
chronology (Ricklis 1994:207). Prewitt (1981:8384) noted differences between the Toyah and the
preceding Austin phase. Prewitt (1981) suggested a
Toyah reliance on bison hunting and possibly some
measure of sporadic maize horticulture. Toyah
assemblages were documented to consist of Perdiz
and Clifton arrow points, Leon Plain and Doss
Redware bone tempered pottery, beveled knives,
small end scrapers, flake drills and a variety of
bone tools (Black 1986:254; Prewitt 1981:83).
Major sites were the Smith Rockshelter (41TV42),
Kyle (41HI1), Oblate (41CM1), Berclair (41GD4);
Finis Frost (41SS20), Loeve-Fox (41WM230) and
Hinojosa sites (41JW8). Trade with coastal and
eastern groups was recognized by the presence
Goose Creek Plain and Caddo influenced ceramics
(Prewitt 1981:84). The estimated age for the
geographically widespread Toyah was 650-200 BP
(A.D. 1300-1750).
As part of the Hinojosa site studies, Black
(1986:255) called into question the notion of a
Toyah phase. Instead, Black (1986:255) presents a
compelling argument that the Toyah represent the
spread of an archeological "horizon" across the

state. The original Willey and Phillips (1958)
definition of a phase is intended to characterize a
homogenous cultural entity restricted to a specific
geographic region (Black 1986:255). However,
Toyah sites are well documented across a variety of
contrasting and/or diverse environmental zones. Citing Willey and Phillips (1958:30), Black (1986)
suggests that the terms "horizon" and/or "tradition"
represent the most practical means for effecting
culture-historical integration on a pan-regional
scale. The term horizon encompasses the broad
and rapid spread of cultural traits and assemblages.
This broad and rapid spread is reflected spatially
in the distribution of archeological sites across
diverse environmental zones. Therefore, the Toyah
may better fit the "horizon" or "tradition" concept
due primarily to noted inconsistencies in Toyah
assemblages. Such inconsistencies include the
presence of foreign ceramics and/or the absence
of important lithic tool forms such as beveled
knives (Johnson 1994:240-242). There are also
notable differences in the radiocarbon ages between Toyah sites in central and north-central
Texas and those in south Texas and adjacent regions. These differences may indicate that the
Toyah do not precisely represent the spread of a
homogenous assemblage in conjunction with a specific group of people.
Building upon these ideas, Ricklis (1994:208)
proposed that the Toyah reflect the spread of a
"techno-complex" of lithic tool forms across the state,
one oriented towards the processing of large mammals. Problems with the horizon concept include the
overall geographic distribution of many of these Iithic
forms beyond the known distribution of the Toyah.
According to Ricklis (1994:208), the spatial continuity suggested by the Willey and Phillips (1958) definition of "horizon" can only be demonstrated for
certain Toyah traits. In addition, ceramic forms evidenced from certain Toyah sites exhibit considerable
stylistic variability. Based on the consistent presence of Toyah lithic forms in association with the
bones of large mammals (bison, deer, antelope),
Ricklis (1994:208) suggests that Toyah assemblages
reflect the infusion of a tool techno-complex well
adapted to the procurement and processing of large
game. A direct correlation is drawn between the
procurement/processing of large prairie/savannah
ungulates and the spread of the Toyah tool assemblage. Ricklis (1994:208) and others (Prewitt 1981;
Quigg and Peck 1995), with good reason, associate

Karbula-The Toyah Bluff Site (41TV441)
Toyah lithic forms with a focus on bison hunting.
Ricklis and Collins (1994) also utilize the more
generic term "interval" to describe this culture-historical period, rather than phase, horizon, or tradition. We also prefer the use of the term "interval"
rather than the typically accepted term "period" or
other such nomenclature.
Johnson (1994) in his analysis of the Toyah
Buckhollow site (41KM16) accounts for some of
these discrepancies with suggestions of a "classic"
vs. a non-classic Toyah culture. Classic Toyah
culture is defined as part of a more widely
distributed Toyah Complex found in the San Angelo
area, the Edwards Plateau and the inland Coastal
Plain (Johnson 1994:241). Classic Toyah is
distinguished mainly by the presence of a
distinctive, crude, plain ware utilitarian pottery.
Such pottery may have originated in the Mogollon
areas of the southwestern United States (see Johnson
1994). The presence of this plainware and associated
lithics is attributed to the influx of a specific group
of people whose ceramics exhibit southwestern
influences (Johnson 1994:271). A widely traveled
and traded bison processing toolkit consisting of
Perdiz arrow points, beveled knives, flake-blade
endscrapers and flake drills may have accompanied
the migration of these groups. Spread of the toolkit
may have been a reaction to a regional increase in
bison on both the Southern High Plains and also in
adjacent, environmentally marginal areas (A.D.
1200-1300). The widespread adoption of this toolkit
may have been a functional response by existing
groups to the increased availability of bison. This
argument in part, may account for some of the
assemblage variability observed at many Toyah sites.
In support of these interpretations is an observed
difference in Toyah assemblage diversity from that
of the earlier Austin interval. Johnson (1994:272)
suggests there is a great difference between the earliest Toyah tools and manufacturing techniques and
those of the preceding Austin interval. This difference, although not dramatic, is evidenced between
the Toyah and the preceding Blow Out Mountain
cultures of the San Angelo area (Creel 1990). The
recently excavated Austin Interval assemblage from
a burned rock midden at the Heard Schoolhouse site
(41 UV86) on the Edwards Plateau is striking because of its lack of diversity (Black et al. 1997:233).
Notably lacking are scrapers, engravers and/or perforators, which are common at all Toyah sites. The
implication for Johnson (1994) is that the arrival of a

59

different group of people stimulated the rather rapid
adoption of a unique lithic assemblage in response to
the increased availability of bison. For Ricklis and
Collins (1994), these differences signify the adoption of the lithic techno-complex by extant groups to
more efficiently process a variety of large mammals,
especially bison.

GEOMORPHIC SUMMARY
The 41TV441 site location is dominated by
the terracing system of the Colorado River and
one of its primary tributaries Onion Creek. The
ridge containing the site represents an erosional
relic terrace of the Onion Creek drainage system.
This terrace was probably formed during the
Middle to Late Pleistocene geological epoch. Geomorphic data indicates the entire top of this ridge
is an upland erosional surface. The surface consists of Pleistocene sediments (orange, silty clays)
overlain by a thin layer of transported Holocene
deposits. Limited slope wash from the neighboring hills and aeolian deposition contribute to the
relatively thin lens of Holocene sediments (ca. 50
cm) containing the site. The slopewash and aeolian
factors are also part of the active erosional processes and overall only serve to slow the rate of
erosion. These conditions allow for the formation
of a condensed stratigraphic lens of archeological
material. Erosion likely reduced the thickness of
the deposit before it was again shallowly buried.
The net effect of this system on archeological deposits is to collapse multiple and time dispersed
occupations into a single zone or surface. The
exception to this is the area of the ephemeral drainage along the eastern portion of the site. The small
drainage appears to have provided a more reliable
source of sediment deposition.
Three basic stratigraphic zones were consistently observed across the site. These exhibit characteristics similar to a structured soil pedon: Ap, A
and B horizons. The upper zone (0-15 cm) consists
of a highly disturbed sand loam plow zone (Ap
horizon). This zone contained numerous displaced
artifacts. This Ap horizon overlies a thin A horizon
(15-60 cm) which consists of a compacted clayey
silty sand deposit. Prehistoric cultural materials are
isolated to the A horizon. The A horizon exhibits
extensive anthropogenic modification. Although the
basic mineral components to the A horizon are

60

locally derived, the sediments are jet black in
color and laden with organic matter. The organic
component to the A horizon sediments represents as much as 8% of the total soil constituents. This highly organic black anthrosolic zone
was consistently associated with intact Late Prehistoric materials. Such a high organic content is
probably the result of intensive burning activities. The sediment resembles the fine organic matrix identified within burned rock
middens in other central Texas sites (Black et al.
1997; Karbula 1997). The thin A horizon overlies
a culturally sterile, deep, reddish brown Pleistocene clay (B horizon).
The nature of the cultural-bearing, organically
rich anthrosol is consistent with the overall state
of preservation of the prehistoric materials at the
site. Numerous elements of burned wood charcoal
and processed plant remains were recovered. The
state of excellent preservation, in part, is attributed to the presence of a perched water table in
the sediments. Excess water from heavy rains, or
from the nearby drainage, collects over the top of
the lower clay zone (no more than 50 centimeters
deep), and cannot penetrate the lower impermeable, clay layer (B horizon). This produces a
perched water table. The water accumulates in the
upper 50 centimeters of sediments (or less). Evidence of this was observed in several of the backhoe trenches excavated on the lower portions of
the ridge. Following heavy rains, water rested on
top of the impermeable clay layer and seeped into
freshly excavated trenches causing collapse of the
profiles. This nearly constant state of moisture in
the soil inhibits the normal oxidation and decay of
the extant organic matter. The water content acts
as a barrier and prevents atmospheric oxygen from
penetrating into the cultural deposits. This process
slows down the production of carbon dioxide and
normal decay. The end result is sediment rich in
preserved organics, generated by a unique set of
preservation circumstances.
There is no real way to discern to what degree the site was constantly inundated. Alternating wet-dry conditions are generally considered
to be detrimental to organic preservation. However, the perched water table observed during
the field investigations, and the presence of the
marshes adjacent to the site, suggest of a nearly
constant state of saturation. The ephemeral drainage marking the eastern boundary of the site is

in reality a run-off channel for funneling water
from higher elevations down slope. This run-off
channel is the primary mechanism for inundating the marsh. Even in drier conditions, the marsh
likely remained somewhat wet. Local residents
confirmed these observations during the course
of the field investigations. There has probably
been little deviation to this pattern over the last
several hundred years.

FEATURES AND ARTIFACTS

Ten features were recorded in Block 1. Three
of these were relatively large pits (Fea. 2, 5, 11).
Two features were dense clusters of burned limestone, quartzite and ocher rocks located immediately adjacent to the pits (Fea. 1, 4). One feature
was more of a single lens scatter of burned limestone and quartzite rocks (Fea. 3). Rock features
were generally present in two types: 1) pits with
intact basin-shaped rock beds or 2) disorganized
clusters of fractured quartzite rocks. The basal
remnants in the pits generally consisted of large,
burned rounded limestone clasts. The adjacent
single lens clusters generally consisted of small,
heavily burned, highly fractured quartzite
cobbles. Ocher and burned chert cobbles were
consistent but infrequent elements of these features. All of the rock features contained some
elements of charcoal. Two postholes (Fea. 7, 8)
and two wooden stakes (Fea. 6, 10) were also
recorded in Block 1.
A total of 11 rock and/or charcoal stained earth
features were identified in Block 2. These consisted
of an overlapping series of rock oven beds,
associated rake-out piles, and individual hearths.
All of these materials were part of a dense
accumulation of shallowly buried, in-situ cooking/
kitchen related prehistoric debris (Figure 3). Rock
features resembled those in Block 1 except pit
features were smaller in size. Features 9 and 12
represented overlapping pit features with rock beds
lined into shallow basins (ca. 20 cm deep basins).
Similar to Block 1, these were composed primarily
of large, rounded, powdery limestone clasts.
Adjacent rock features were more scattered and
disorganized and contained primarily burned and
fractured quartzite (Fea. 13, 16). One pit that was
relatively free of rock was recorded (Fea. 15).
Additional rock features in Block 2 consisted of

Karbula-The Toyah Bluff Site (41TV441)

61

discrete concentrations of both
limestone and quartzite in equitable mixes (Fea. 17, 18, 19) and
rock filled pits (Fea. 24).
Invariably, rock features at the
site consist of three types of rocks
(limestone, quartzite and chert).
The rock beds of pit features from
both blocks contain similar ratios
of these three types of rocks. Those
features interpreted to represent the
rock beds of earth ovens are of
varying sizes ranging from approximately 60 centimeters to nearly two
meters in diameter and are composed primarily of large rounded
limestone clasts. In contrast the second type of feature consists primarily of smaller quartzite cobbles. In
some cases these are interpreted to
represent displaced lid rock or rakeout piles from the ovens (Fea. 13,
16, 24). In others a more equitable
mix of limestone and quartzite
rocks are present in a single, spatially discrete layer, and in the absence of stained sediments, suggest
small, independent hearth features
(Fea. 17, 18). The latter are interpreted to represent small cooking
or warming fires or perhaps discard piles. In several instances,
eaiih oven beds and possible rakeout piles are located either in close
proximity to one another and/or are

contrast to other Toyah sites, no personal items
such as beads or decorated marine shells or smoking pipes were recovered.
The overall assemblage at the site conforms
quite well to other documented Toyah assemblages
on the Edwards Plateau, the Blackland Prairie, and
to a certain extent the coastal regions. There is
generally some variation in Toyah assemblages from
all of these areas. A few Scallorn, Toyah, and/or
other expanding stem or side notched arrow points
typically occur in what are considered pure Toyah
lithic assemblages (Black 1986; Johnson 1994;
Treece et al. 1993). There is also variation in ceramic types in different regions in terms of tempering, vessel shape and exterior decoration. While
nearly undecipherable, Toyah Bluff ceramics exhibit some variation in temper and possibly manufacturing techniques. A total of 48 sherds were
recovered representing three basic types. The Toyah

Bluff assemblage lacks sandstone shaft abraders
and soapstone pipes and bone implements and/or
decorated bone items. It contains unusually large
numbers of manos and metate fragments.

Earth Ovens and Charred Bulbs
Earth ovens are multi-functional appliances
utilized for the cooking of a variety of both plant
and animal foods. Although smaller ovens may be
used for the short term cooking of meat, the largest
and hottest ovens with the longest cooking periods
are utilized to cook fatty meats or plant foods
(Dering 2001 :B-14). Bulb producing plants
(geophytes) were a source of carbohydrates to a
wide range of prehistoric inhabitants in Texas. Bulbs
are plants consisting of modified thickened leaves
arranged around a central compressed stem, such as
an onion (Dering 2001 :B-14). The use of earth oven

oven features in Late Prehistoric sites has recently
been documented at the Honey Creek site (41MS32,
Black et al. 1997). Numerous types of possible

plant foods were recovered in direct association
with Toyah age pit oven features at Honey Creek
including charred onion bulbs. The oft overlooked
Toyah component at the Kyle site records numerous charred onion sheaths and the presence of pit
oven like features (41HI1, Jelks 1962).

At Honey Creek, evidence for oven clean out
events (Black 1997:262-265) was identified which
extended for one meter beyond the perimeter of
two rock features (Fea. 7 and 8). One feature (Fea.
8) was convincingly argued to represent the cleanout debris from another (Fea. 7). Carbonized plant
material including chan-ed fuel wood and food was
associated with both the oven (F7) and the adjacent
debris scatter (Fea. 8) (Black 1997:119; Dering
1997: 590). The chan-ed plant debris recovered from
the cleanout area adjacent to the earth oven included
fragments of yucca/sotol leaf. These materials were
part of the food load which was accidentally

carbonized during the baking process in the oven
(Dering 200l:B-15). In this situation, it would be
expected that cleanout trash, especially charcoal,
would be scattered across the living surface of the
site by human activities and natural forces (Fea. 8).

Feature 11 was nearly identical in morphology
to Fea. 2. This deep pit feature was located immediately south of and adjacent to Fea. 4 (a small
concentration of limestone and quartzite rocks- contained one piece of ground stone), in the south
central portion of Block l (TUs 25, 26). The top of
the stained earth of Feature 11 was detected at the
bottom of Level 3 and the top of Level 4 (TU 26,
98.43-98.41). The linear stain of Fea. 11 measured
approximately lx.5 meters in diameter. The matrix
fill of the pit consisted of a dark black anthropogenic sediment. The outline of the pit and the fill
was highly visible against the surrounding terrace
deposits. The pit measured approximately 30 centimeters in depth (98.40-98.10). Small fractured
pieces of quartzite were recorded along the upper
edges of the pit (98.41-98.31) and along the upper
northeast corner (n-20, 98.34). Progressively larger
rocks were recorded deeper in the pit and these
angled inwards towards the center.
A total of 80 rocks were recorded in the central
rock bed of the pit (Figure 10). A grouping of
approximately 10 large rocks was present in the
bottom of the pit. Several of these measured close
to 20 centimeters in length (along one axis). One
appeared to have cracked in situ, through either
weathering or burning. The central grouping of these
rocks consisted of 80-90% large, rounded, burned
limestone clasts. These are interpreted to represent
the remnants of the basal cooking element of an
earth oven.
Charcoal was abundant in Fea. 11 at and below
the level of the lowest rocks. Four sediment samples
from the fill of the feature (Lots 31, 35, 36, 40)
collected at or below the level of the rocks yielded
six charred onion bulb fragments along with live
oak and Texas persimmon wood charcoal. Three
quartzite mano fragments were recorded in Fea. 11
(Lot 341a-c). The presence of multiple charred onion bulb fragments and ground stone in the feature,
coupled with its pit morphology, is suggestive of
plant food processing (Black et al. 1997).
Block 2
In Block 2, Features 9 and 12 are interpreted to
represent the basal elements of earth ovens (Figures 11, 12). Both are excavated into shallow pits
approximately 20-30 centimeters below the tops of
the rocks. The beds consist almost exclusively of
large, burned, rounded limestone clasts. The basins

extend below the level of the rocks and charcoal
was present in the bottom of the basins, below the
rocks. Features 13, 15 and 16 were located immediately adjacent and partially overlapping with the
F9/12 complex. Feature 13 was a single lens of
rocks thick and composed primarily of quartzite.
Its disorganized and jumbled appearance coupled
with the lack of any basin was suggestive of a lid
rock or rake-out pile. Feature 15 was located between Fea. 13 and Fea. 16. Feature 15 consisted of
a pit lacking rock. The pit itself was delineated in
profile by tracing the edges of the charcoal stained
earth. A few burned rocks and other artifacts lined
the upper edges of the pit. Charcoal and 1-2 stone
tools were found in the bottom of the pit. Feature
16 was a relatively large single lens of rocks abutting the rockless pit (Fea. 15). Feature 16 was composed primarily of fractured quartzite cobbles but
contained a variety of different types of burned
rocks and stone tools. Feature 16 is interpreted to
represent a lid rock or rake-out pile from Fea. 15.
A total of 15 pieces of ground stone were recorded in Block 2. Two conjoining pieces of a
sandstone mano were collected from within F9 (Lot
349a, b). This sandstone material does not appear
to be local and the artifact may have been imported
into the site. Two charred pieces of another refitted
mano fragment were recovered from the sediments
overlying F9 (Lot 347a, b). A mano/hammerstone
was recovered immediately adjacent to Fea. 14 and
F9/12 in TU 45 (Lot 293d). Two refitted pieces of a
mano fragment were recovered from Fea. 24, in TU
43 (Lot 262a, c). A third ground stone fragment
was also recorded in this same cluster (Lot 362b)
and a fourth less than a meter distant (Lot 363).
Charred onion bulbs are common in Block 2.
These were recovered in apparent association with
the rock features. Six charred elements in Block 2
were identified as onion bulbs of the Lily family. The
proveniences of these are: 1) the matrix of Fea. 12
(Lot 57); 2) immediately adjacent to F9/12 (Lot 103);
approximately 50 centimeters north of Fea. 12 (Lot
99); underneath the rocks in F9 (flotation sample 51 );
5) in the sediments associated with Fea. 19 (Lot 102)
and 6) in Test Unit 53, adjacent to Fea. 16 (Lot 104).
The recovery of charred bulbs from both feature and non-feature contexts at the site is characteristic of the earth oven cooking process (De1ing
200l:B-ll). A total of four of the charred onion
bulb fragments (Lots 99, 101, 102, 103) come from
non-feature contexts. The recovery of even a small

number of these bulbs around the edges of these
features indicates a functional relationship, for several reasons (Phil Dering, personal communication
1999). For one, plant foods processed in the ovens
would likely have been raked out leaving the majority of the surviving elements located outside of

and adjacent to the oven, not necessarily within it.
The edible onion bulbs would have been consumed
and only a few charred, inedible fragments would
be left behind. Second, the organic preservation at
prehistoric sites is generally such that the survival
of only a few charred plant remains may indicate

Karbula-The Toyah Bluff Site (41TV441)
much larger processing events. The presence of
charred bulbs or bulb elements from both feature
and non-feature contexts indicates the intensity of
earth oven use at the site (Dering 200l:B15). In
addition to the non-feature material, whole bulbs
were noted in Feature 9, and fragments in Features
2, 9 and 9/12 and 11. The presence of bulb fragments from these rock features backs up the evidence of food remains from the non-feature samples
and confirms the functions of these earth ovens at
the Toyah Bluff site.

Oven Structure
The structure of earth ovens at the Toyah Bluff
site is consistent with several posited models of
oven construction and use (Ellis 1997). The earliest
ovens at the site appear to have been constructed by
first piling wood into the basin, burning it, and then
adding rocks, either heated or unheated. The basins
in the F9/12 complex in Block 2 show evidence of
burned sediment and charcoal was recovered under
the basin rocks. Ellis (1997:69) describes a similar
construction technique utilized by the Yana of northcentral California. Under this method, the wood is
fired and the rocks placed on top of the wood. The
fire dies down and the rocks collapse into the bottom of the pit. Then the remaining layers of the
oven are added. The archeological signature of this
technique includes a burned or oxidized soil rind
within the pit, a jumbled rather than layer arrangement of basined rocks and large chunks of charcoal
(because of the reduced oxygen environment). In
this manner, charcoal would be found under, among
and atop the rocks (Ellis 1997:69). Ellis (1997)
emphasizes variation and recombination of various
oven construction techniques. The rocks in F9/12
in Block 2, and Fea. 11 in Block 1, exhibit loose
but basically patterned arrangements of basin rocks.
Charcoal in Fea. 11 was recovered under, between
and on top of the rocks.
Feature 2 in Block 1 may have been constructed
differently. The rock bed in Fea. 2 is a closely
patterned arrangement. Charcoal was recovered both
between the rocks and on top of the rock bed. Such
a construction technique is consistent with that observed by the Karok of northern California and the
Panamint Indians of southern California, with minor variation (Ellis 1997:67). Under this scenario,
the pit is lined with rocks and the fire built on top of
the rocks. The ashes are removed leaving the hot

73

rock bed as the heating element. This is followed
by the addition of layers of packing material and
food. A second fire was then built on top of the
oven and/or additional layers of heated stones were
used as part of the packing material. The archeological signatures of these types of ovens, again
with some variation, would include a lack of burned
sediment remaining in the pit. The original pit matrix, however, which would be displaced when the
food was removed, would contain bits of burned
sediment and charred fragments of packing material. There would also be an organized, patterned
rock bed. Under the scenario of additional layers of
heated stones, the process of opening the pit and
retrieving the food would differentially displace individual rocks from the multiple layers. Many rocks
would get tossed out and/or mixed with the burned
soil and charred vegetal material. The signature of
this type of an oven would consist of a lower, intact
pavement of rocks, overlain by a matrix of burned
soil, ash, small charcoal flecks and burned rocks.
Charcoal would be found on top and among the
rocks, as in Fea. 2.
Other documented methods of construction are
equally plausible at the Toyah Bluff site. Under a
recombination of the above techniques, stones may
have been heated in a fire beside the pit. Then hot
coals from the adjacent fire were raked into the pit
followed by a layer of stones. Hot stones could be
added as additional layers of packing material, along
with the food. This technique utilizing two separate
fires is documented among the Miwok of central
California (Ellis 1997:74). The archeological signature resembles those of fires placed first in the
pit, but adds the new element of a second fire and
additional heated stones. There are two instances at
the Toyah Bluff site where smaller rock features
are located immediately adjacent to the ovens (Fea.
1, 4). These are not interpreted as discard piles. The
second fire method is particularly appealing for the
Toyah Bluff site because of the large numbers of
heavily burned quartzite rocks that are recorded in
apparent rake-out or discard piles. These quartzite
rocks could have been heated in adjacent fires.
In fact, the function of the quartzite rocks in
these ovens at the Toyah Bluff site is an intriguing
and unknown aspect. Hundreds of heavily burned
quartzite rocks are present. Some of these are
present in the rock beds but most are recorded in
adjacent and physically attached piles interpreted
to represent discard or rake-out from the ovens. A

74

Texas Archeological Society

plausible scenario is that these ovens used heated
layers of quartzite as part of the packing material.
The heavily burned nature of many of these rocks
(fire fractured, blackened) suggests the direct application of flame and consistent with the second
fire beside the pit technique. Overall, the use of
heated rocks as part of the packing material seems to
be consistent with the large numbers of heavily
burned quartzite, and their contexts at the site. However, a heavy emphasis on stone boiling is also possible. There may be some evidence of this at the site
in the form of intensively processed bone fragments.
Skin lined pits and pottery jars were certainly available to the native inhabitants. Boiling and degreasing
bones to make pemmican, a transportable foodstuff,
is certainly documented among the Toyah (Quigg
and Peck 1995). The quartzite rocks may have been
ideal for this purpose.
Black et al. (1997:54) suggest that compared to
igneous and metamorphic rocks, limestone breaks
down faster and produces more waste for the same
number of heating/dowsing episodes. By contrast,
quartzite is more resilient when heated and allowed
to cool in place. In experiments, quartzite rocks
exposed to repeated heating/dowsing episodes could
be reused for long periods before they exhibited
noticeable color changes and jagged breaks (Black
et al. 1997:54). In fact, archeological evidence from
the northwest United States suggests differential
patterning in the breaks exhibited by burned quartzite cobbles (Black et al. 1997:54). It would be interesting to compare the Toyah Bluff rock data within
the framework of these results. This is a definite
avenue of future research. For the most part, the
Toyah Bluff quartzite rocks are heavily burned,
reddened, blackened and exhibit jagged fracture
patterns. Spatial association suggests that concentrated piles of these may have been part of the earth
ovens. All of the piles interpreted as rake-out/discard contained large limestone rocks as well and
there were no isolated piles of pure quartzite. Still,
a combination of stone boiling and the use of hot
quartzite rocks in the ovens is plausible. A charred
but fresh acorn was recovered near Feature 2 in
Block 1. The current data set does not provide a
definitive answer on this issue.
SITE DATING
The dating of charred organic remains in association with these hearth features indicates a series

of overprinted Late Prehistoric events. The geomorphic situation is also consistent with that of a
culturally overprinted archeological surface. Yet,
the total range of occupation indicated by the radiocarbon dates for the site as a whole is only some
225 years. The earliest dates are from Block 2. A
charred onion bulb from Fea. 12 (Lot 57) has yielded
an AMS radiocarbon assay of 800 +/-60 B.P. (Intercept 1235 A.D., Beta 131108). Charred live oak
wood (Lot 92) from the bottom of Fea. 15 yielded
an AMS radiocarbon assay of 800 +/- 50 B.P. (Intercept 1205 A.D ., Beta 131110). Thus, the spatially overlapping complex of pit and other features
from Block 2 range at 2-sigma probability from approximately A.D. 1040 to 1290 with intercepts at
A.D. 1205 and 1235. The onion bulb from Fea. 12
(Lot 57) was embedded deep within the matrix of
the feature within the rock bed and appears to represent primary context, despite the erosional te1nce
situation. The temporal framework from the Block 2
features is therefore terminal Austin interval. These
dates might be interpreted as consistent with the
presence of Scallorn and other side-notched arrow
points present in Block 2, and/or the transitional
Archaic dart point that was recovered in Block 2.
The AMS radiocarbon dates from Block 1 are
later but consistent with those from Block 2. In
Block 1, charred live oak wood (Lot 84) from Fea.
11 yielded an assay of 710 +/- 50 B.P. (intercept
A.D. 1275, Beta 131109). The 2-sigma calibrated
range is A.D. 1205-1300. The wood from Fea. 11
was collected from numerous charcoal elements
embedded between the bottom rocks of the bed in
the pit and there is no evidence of disturbance or
significant overprinting in Block 1. Still later, a
charred onion bulb (Lot 97) from Feature 2 in Block
1 yielded an assay of 520 +/- 60 B.P. (Intercept
A.D. 1425, Beta 131111). The 2-sigma calibrated
range is A.D. 1310-1480. Similarly, the onion bulb
fragment from Fea. 2 was collected from charcoal
stained sediments between the rocks of the immense rock bed, at the base of the rocks. The Fea.
11 date is terminal Austin or transitional into the
Toyah Interval. The Fea. 2 assay falls squarely into
the known range of the Toyah in central Texas.
Each of these features was excavated by the aboriginal inhabitants on the same archeological surface, approximately 150 years removed in time.
Yet, the pits are identical and contain the same
types of charred materials in the form of oak wood
and onion bulbs.

Karbula-The Toyah Bluff Site (41TV441)
Three of the intercept dates between the two
blocks are very consistent and range within about
70 years of each other (intercepts from A.D. 12051275). The total range of occupation indicated for
the site is approximately 225 years but could be
more based on the heavy density of Toyah related
materials near the surface. There is an increasing
density of Toyah diagnostics in the upper disturbed
portions of the site.
ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION
One of the critical issues at the site given the
radiocarbon dates (ca. A.D. 1225) is the co-occurrence of Scallorn and other side notched arrow points
with Toyah diagnostics. In Block 2, Toyah and Austin phase diagnostics co-occur within the context of
a diverse assemblage. Two Scallorn (Lot 301, 361)
and two unclassified side-notched arrow points (Lot
293b, 233) were recovered in Levels 2-3 along with
two Perdiz preforms (Lot 29la, 293a), one Perdiz
point (Lot 302a), one beveled knife (Lot 296), three
blade-like flake tools/blades (Lot 370, 373e, 292c),
one uniface (Lot 312), and one perforator (Lot 301a).
Three additional flake blades were recovered from
the contextual zones (Levels 2-3) in shovel tests
immediately adjacent to Block 2 (Lot 95c, d, 11 Ob).
Overall assemblage diversity in the contextual zones
in Block 2 includes 17 bifaces, 10 pieces of
groundstone, 13 cores/core fragments, seven modified flakes and 13 pieces of ocher. The radiocarbon
dates are early for what is considered to be the range
of the Toyah and consistent for what has generally
been considered the end of the Austin phase.
The presence of Scallorn and other side notched
arrow points is consistent with either an Austin or a
Toyah Interval occupation. The AMS radiocarbon
dates (A.D. 1225) are consistent with an Austin
Interval occupation, according to the cmTent literature. However, the presence of a possible Perdiz
preform seemingly in context adjacent to Fea. 14
(Lot 299a, 99.36 below datum) is suggestive of
Toyah influences. Two blade-like flake tools (Lot
370, 373e) were found in apparent contextual sediments in Test Units 42 and 46, in the southern
portion of Block 2. These were located adjacent to
the rock filled pit Fea. 25 which contained a Scallorn
atTOW point (Lot 361). A modified blade was recovered from the screened sediments of Unit 44,
adjacent to F9 and Fea. 13. In this context, blade
technologies are Toyah indicators.

75

The presence of a beveled knife (Lot 296a) and
numerous small, intensively processed bone fragments in the matiix fill of Fea. 13 tolerably argues
for a Toyah feature. These artifacts were not found
on the erosional surface but in the fill of Fea. 13,
which appears to be the rake-out pile of a pit feature whose morphology is uncharacteristically
Toyah. Additionally, intensively processed bone
fragments are Toyah indicators, and overall assemblage diversity is also suggestive of a Toyah occupation. In contrast, Austin phase assemblages are
noted for a lack of diversity (Black et al. 1997).
There are two possible interpretations for the Toyah
Bluff assemblage. Toyah materials may be overprinted onto an Austin Interval series of features
throughout several hundred years at this site, or the
peoples who constructed the central midden complex of Block 2 were utilizing a blade oriented and
highly diverse lithic assemblage during what is characteristically considered pre-Toyah times.
Two Toyah lithic forms are present in the contextual zones of Block 1 and the overall assemblage is diverse. One modified blade (Lot 248) and
a modified flake perforator manufactured on an
expanding stem arrow point (Lot 273a) were recovered from Level 3 of Block 1. The stone tool assemblage in Levels 3-5 consists of five bifaces, 10
pieces of ground stone, seven cores or core fragments, two modified flakes and 10 pieces of ocher.
Given the erosional nature of the terrace, some of
these forms could have migrated down through the
sediments. Others may be the result of Toyah occupations occurring on the same original surface as
earlier occupations.
Although ceramics were recovered from the
Toyah Bluff site, very little can actually be said
about the ceramic making industry and use, since
most of the sherds found were very small and highly
eroded. Based on paste alone, however, a few inferences have been made. The ceramic assemblage
supports the idea that the people who lived at
41TV441 were culturally affiliated with the Toyah
people. Eighteen of the ceramic sherds recovered at
the Toyah Bluff Site (Group 1) exhibit characteristics that fall well within the range of Toyah ceramics. These ceramics are made of course sandy paste
tempered with bone. All appear to be undecorated.
However, a second ceramic type, Group 3, suggests
that there may also have been other cultural influences operating. Fifteen ceramic sherds fall into the
Group 3 category, defined by a fine hard sandy

76

paste with only occasional bone tempering. The
Group 3 ceramics strongly resemble undecorated
Rockport ceramics of the Texas coast and may
indicate cultural influences from other regions,
such as the Texas Coast or the Eastern CrossTimbers region.

SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS

The cultural zones in both blocks 1 and 2 exhibit non-random patterning for all artifact classes.
Clearly the burned rock features, especially the pit
ovens, exhibit patterned arrangements. Debitage,
bone and ceramics are present throughout both
blocks but are localized and concentrated near the
features. Although the upper portions are somewhat disturbed, these zones represent a series of
intact Late Prehistoric subsistence related events.
The occupations occurred from approximately A.D.
1200 to at least A.D. 1425. This time frame spans
what has consistently been thought of as the late
and/or transitional Austin Interval into the Toyah
Interval of central Texas prehistory. There was
clearly a Toyah presence at the site. This assertion
is based on the recovery of Perdiz arrow points,
beveled knives, endscrapers, perforators, modified
flakes and blades, ocher and bone tempered ceramics. There are also Scallorn and other expanding
stem arrow points recovered in close spatial proximity to the earliest dated hearth features at the site.
The most remarkable aspect of the site is the
consistent association of earth ovens, ground stone
implements and charred onion bulbs with Late Prehistoric lithic artifacts and radiocarbon dates. There
is a consistent set of associations between pit oven
features and charred plant remains throughout the
entire history of the site. Charred onion bulbs are
present in and around the Feature 9/12 complex in
Block 2 at A.D. 1235, in Feature 11 in Block 1 at
A.D. 1275, and in Feature 2 in Block 1 at A.D.
1425. One definite function of the site is onion bulb
processing. Animals and shellfish were also processed and presumably consumed. The plant food
processing aspect is not unheard of (Black et al.
1997) but is relatively unique for a Late Prehistoric
site. At least one of the earth ovens is Toyah in age
(Fea. 2). The possibility of plant food processing in
earth ovens is particularly unique for a possible
Toyah occupation, especially in the relative absence of significant faunal remains at the site (see

below). So, given that the site function remains
consistent, the issue becomes, were these Austin or
Toyah Interval occupations, or both?
Erosion at the site makes it difficult to definitively address this issue. Artifacts from the later
Toyah occupations could have filtered down through
the sands and into the earlier ones. This aspect may
be more pronounced in Block 2. Throughout two
hundred years or more of intermittent Late Prehistoric occupation, artifacts were discarded and compressed into a single zone or archeological surface
remnant, then shallowly buried by a combination
of factors.
There are three possible interpretations for the
origin of the Toyah Bluff site. These are: 1) An
invasive Toyah group initially occupied the site ca.
1200 A.D. bearing attributes of "Classic" Toyah
culture, but also some variations in terms of side
notched arrow points and different styles of a crude
utilitarian pottery (manufactured or later acquired).
These people then intermittently occupied the site
to process plants, animals and shellfish throughout
several hundred years; 2) An Austin Interval group
was replaced by an invasive Toyah group in the
later history of the site or 3) an Austin Interval
group gradually experimented with and adopted a
blade technology throughout a history of intermittent occupations, and evolved into a Toyah culture.
Whichever is the case, it is certain that earth ovens
were utilized to process a variety of subsistence
resources, especially onion bulbs.
We favor the idea of an Austin Interval group
gradually adopting a blade technology and contracting stem arrow points for several reasons. It is
reasonably well documented that Austin Interval
peoples processed plant foods. Hearth features are
constructed and utilized in the same manner
throughout the history of the site, to process the
same sorts of subsistence materials, which argues
against succeeding groups of different sociocultural
affiliations. There is also evidence of a Perdiz arrow point and blade technology that intensifies
through time. The patterning observed in lithic reduction debris and faunal materials also remains
consistent throughout the history of the site. The
following discussion explores these and related issues and focuses on the implications of the data on
the three possibilities mentioned above. The possibility is also explored that the site may represent a
warm season Toyah plant food processing station
(Black et al. 1997).

Karbula-The Toyah Bluff Site (41TV441)
Hearth Feature Morphology
and Utilization
One very important aspect among many at
the Toyah Bluff site (41TV441) is the consistent
morphology of the hearth features. At least one
use of all the pit oven features at the Toyah
Bluff site was for the processing of onion bulbs.
Charred onion bulbs were recovered from a number of pit oven feature contexts at the site. A
total of 10 charred onion bulbs were recovered
from Block 1, within or adjacent to the major pit
features (Fea. 2, Fea. 11). Six additional onion
bulbs or bulb fragments were recovered in Block
2. The use of pit oven features for the processing
of plant foods and related incipient burned rock
midden formation has been extensively detailed
in the recent archeological literature, though generally not related to Toyah sites (Black et al.
1997; Black et al. 1998a, 1998b; Jelks 1962;
Johnson 1991, 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994).
Supporting the possible association of ovens and
plant foods at the Toyah Bluff site is the notable
presence of ground stone. A total of 29 pieces of
ground stone were recovered at the site, nearly
all of it in hearth feature contexts.
Pit oven features at the Toyah Bluff site
likely functioned in many capacities, not just for
plant food processing. A number of animal bones
were recovered in hearth feature contexts. In general, animal bones are one of the least numerous
of the documented artifact classes but were
clearly part of the subsistence strategy. It is
tempting to suggest that plant food processing
was more important than animal food processing
at the Toyah Bluff site, given the physical remains (earth ovens, 29 pieces of ground stone).
Other Toyah sites exhibit the presence of thousands of bones in specialized intensive processing areas (Creel 1990; Johnson 1995; Ricklis
1995). It is also possible that poor faunal preservation coupled with erosion at the site has destroyed most of the remaining animal bone. It
may be that a bone processing area once existed
in other areas along the ridge but now is heavily
disturbed. Bivalves may also have formed a very
important dietary component. Numerous elements of fresh water mussel were recovered and
these can be baked easily in an earth oven.
The radiocarbon dating of associated macroplant remains coupled with feature morphology illustrates a consistent method of construction and

77

use of pit ovens throughout the history of the site,
though tending towards elaboration in size. The
same types of rocks were employed in the pit ovens, in the same types of arrangements. The same
types of plant foods were processed in ovens of
varying sizes. Hearth features that span some 225
years or more in time are associated with the same
sorts of charred plant remains, exhibit the same
technology, and most are associated with ground
stone. Such continuity strongly suggests a single
ethnic group who maintained a consistent subsistence technology through time, at a particular location on the landscape. This observation has important implications for the issue of whether the Toyah
represent an influx of a specific toolkit or the migration of an invasive people.

Site Function
It is well documented that Austin phase
peoples created and/or utilized a number of burned
rock middens (Kleinbach et al. 1995; Quigg and
Ellis 1994; Treece et al. 1993). Radiocarbon dates
and subsistence data from the Honey Creek
(41MS32) and other central Texas sites suggest a
strong presence at and/or the utilization of a number of burned rock middens by Toyah peoples
(Black et al. 1997). It has also been effectively
argued that burned rock midden formation is functionally related to the use of earth ovens (Black et
al. 1997, 1998b). The kitchen-midden complex at
the Toyah Bluff site has all the appearance of a
burned rock midden in the early stages of formation. The very high density of burned rocks and
other artifactual debris is clearly the result of multiple instances of earth oven utilization.
The consistent association of ground stone with
the pit features and charred onion bulbs cannot be
ignored. In discussions of the Honey Creek site
(41MS32, Black et al. 1997) the authors suggest
the possibility of the existence of other types of
Toyah sites than just bison/deer processing stations,
or stone tool manufacturing localities. These authors posit that the generalized need for starchy
foods may have fostered a measure of reliance on
plant foods, and that these types of sites may be
obscured in the archeological record. Late Prehistoric sites of this nature are difficult to detect because they are generally overprinted onto the remains of earlier occupations, including burned rock
middens. Such a subsistence strategy may have been

78

Texas Archeological Society

practiced during the warmer seasons when bison
were generally less available in central-Texas. Late
prehistoric plant food exploitation at the Honey
Creek site may have been primarily a warm season
occupation (Black et al. 1997). Creel (1990) suggests that Late Prehistoric bison exploitation at
41TG91, in northwest central Texas was primarily
a cold season activity. As part of the 41TG91 study,
Scott and Creel (1990) posit that the lower portion
of the Toyah A-3 zone was a warm season occupation because of the relative scarcity of bison bone
in the presence of numerous, warmer season small
mammal bones.
Was the Toyah Bluff site primarily a warm
season plant food processing station focused on the
utilization of a burned rock midden? This possibility must be accounted for, and given the physical
data at the site, is even quite likely. Bison and deer
processing stations at 41 TG9 l, the Buckhollow site
(41KM16), the Mustang Branch site (41HY209T,
Ricklis 1994) and the Hinojosa site (41JW8, Black
1986) record many thousands of large mammal bone
fragments, in the presence of many smaller mammal elements and rarely a pit feature or a piece of
ground stone.
The Toyah Bluff site (41TV441) was definitely a different type of site than has been typically documented in the settlement-subsistence
system of the Late Prehistoric Interval of this
area along Onion Creek, adjacent to the Edwards
Plateau. Several Toyah sites upstream, which
post-date the Toyah Bluff site, represent specialized processing areas and/or base camps. These
sites exhibit considerable functional and structural diversity within a very limited area
(41HY202A, 41HY209T, 41HY209M, Ricklis
and Collins 1994). Yet none of these sites resemble the Toyah Bluff site. The Barton Site
North (41HY202A) is a distinctive lithic production/stone tool manufacturing area. The Mustang Branch site (41HY209T) is a large mammal
processing and possible base camp. Still another
site (41HY209M) is a burned rock midden which
exhibits a thin layer of Toyah refuse overlying
what appears to be an Austin Interval occupation. Was the Toyah Bluff site a burned rock
midden in the making? If so, were these people
Austin or Toyah people, or both? These are some
the important questions for future research at
other sites that emerge from the analysis of the
Toyah Bluff site.

The Toyah Techno-complex

Implications for the Austin/Toyah
Regional Framework
It seems clear that the first group occupying
the site processed onion bulbs, animals and shellfish, in a series of spatially overlapping pit ovens
and/or rockless pits represented by Block 2. Occupation of the site continued intermittently for at
least 225 years, probably more. Throughout this
time pit ovens were constructed closer to the ephemeral drainage to the east of the site (ca. A.D. 12751435). These were larger and placed farther apart
than their predecessors on the western ridge. The
morphology of these pit features was identical in
form, structure and content to those located to the
west. Continuity was maintained in hearth feature
morphology and utilization throughout the site's
history. Stone tool manufacturing and refurbishing
was consistently an important site activity. At some
point, Toyah lithics came to dominate the site, but
when? The erosional terrace situation and its possible effects on assemblage composition have been
noted. We will more closely examine the most plausible scenario of site formation.
An Austin Interval group gradually experimenting with and adopting a blade technology
throughout intermittent occupations at the site
seems the most plausible explanation. In fact, we
favor the idea of an Austin Interval group in the
process of either adopting the Toyah lithic technocomplex or initially occupying the site with a blade
technology in hand. For one, Austin phase peoples
are well known for the construction of burned
rock middens which presumably can be equated
with earth ovens and a certain measure of plant
food exploitation (Black et al. 1997). There is
certainly evidence of incipient midden formation
and plant food exploitation at the site. Secondly,
the only material aspect that really changes
throughout the history of the site is the ratio of
numbers of side-notched to contracting-stern
Perdiz projectiles. All but one of the side-notched
arrow points were found in association with the
kitchen-midden complex in Block 2 in areas that
yielded the earliest dates (ca. A.D. 1205-1235).
Most of the Perdiz arrow points were recovered in
the upper disturbed sediments. Only two Perdiz
points were recovered in the contextual zones of
either block. This may reflect an increased reliance
on Perdiz forms in the later history of the site.

Karbula-The Toyah Bluff Site (41TV441)
One of these Perdiz arrow points was recovered
relatively deep in the sediments adjacent to Fea. 14
in Block 2. The artifact is an aberrant Perdiz-like
preform. It is longer than all of the Perdiz points
recovered at the site. Its crude, bifacial morphology
is suggestive of experimentation rather than fine
tuned production. This artifact was recovered
immediately adjacent to the main earth ovens in the
kitchen midden complex and from the same context
as the Scallorn and other side notched arrow points.
A number of blades and blade-like flakes were also
recovered in the contextual zones of Block 2. The
presence of this odd Perdiz-like preform might
suggest experimentation with a contracting stem
variant of arrow point while side-notched arrows
were still in use. Ricklis (1994) suggests that the
bifacial Perdiz forms may have preceded the flakePerdiz forms. In Block 1, a modified blade and a
perforator manufactured on an expanding stem
arrow point were recovered, but no Perdiz arrow
points (Levels 3-4). The presence of these two
artifacts is consistent with the idea of the possible
adoption of a blade technology that did not yet
include large numbers of Perdiz arrow points.
In support of the adoption of the lithic technocomplex, Ricklis (1994:301) suggests that there is
no compelling evidence for the migration of the
Toyah peoples and the subsequent displacement of
existing groups. The corollary to large scale migration is that much of the indigenous central Texas
population must have retreated in the face of a
dynamically expanding Toyah occupation. Based
on the documented radiocarbon evidence, this must
have occurred during the A.D. 1300's. Yet, there
are few documented archeological components of
post A.D. 1300 range that can be attributed to such
displaced groups. In fact, nearly all of the sites that
date to this period yield Toyah-like assemblages.
Ricklis (1994:303) also convincingly argues that
evidence of the diffusion of the Toyah tool kit is
straightforward along coastal areas of Texas. The
Rockport component of Site 41RFea. 21 in Refugio
County, Texas exhibits Toyah complex traits and
subsistence patterns, yet sandy paste, asphaltumcoated and/or decorated Rockport ware pottery.
Ricklis (1994:304) suggests that the linguistically
and ethnically distinct coastal Karankawans rapidly
responded to the influx of bison and adopted the
primary elements of the toolkit. The data from this
and other coastal sites supports the adoption of the
toolkit rather than the influx of people.

79

The geomorphic situation on the terrace
precludes a definitive answer. A prominent scenario
is that an Austin Interval group initially occupied
the site bearing both side-notched arrows and some
measure of a blade technology (or began to adopt
Toyah lithics shortly thereafter), and were
experimenting with Perdiz points and other pure
Toyah lithic forms. Through time, Toyah lithic
forms were more widely utilized evidenced by the
increasing density of these forms in the upper
sediments of the site. The use of side-notched mTows
was gradually phased out at the site in favor of the
use of Perdiz points. If so, then the Toyah Bluff site
(41TV441) may represent evidence of the adoption
of the Toyah lithic techno-complex slightly earlier
than has been previously documented in centralTexas (ca. A.D. 1200).
Cultural Ecological Model
If the Toyah in this region represent the influx
of lithic techno-complex, then the site may represent a continuation of the basic Austin Interval subsistence adaptation. Under a culture-ecological
model for the diffusion of the Toyah complex
(Ricklis 1994) and its effects on Austin Interval
groups, culture change through time would have
been measured in a number of different ways. In
response to the stimulus of a return to relative arid
climatic conditions, bison may have become more
prevalent in the area (Ricklis 1994). Bison represented a greater subsistence resource in terms of
food quantity and invaluable hides. The mobility of
existing groups increased in response to the mobile
nature of the bison. The adoption of an available
technology geared to the procurement of large game
may have been facilitated by increased mobility
and constant contact with neighboring groups
(Ricklis 1994). These peoples may have practiced
their subsistence rounds in limited interaction
spheres based on the observed variation in regional
ceramics (Ricklis 1994).
As these groups became more highly mobile,
sites became more specialized in function (bison
processing, lithic reduction, plant food processing)
and a greater number of different types of sites
appeared in the archeological record. These peoples
may have adopted new technology and strategies to
exploit bison, but did not give up previously
established, reliable subsistence practices. Plant
food processing localities such as the Toyah Bluff

80

site continued to be utilized but perhaps less
frequently due to the increased focus on large game.
Burned rock midden locations would have been
revisited with the new tool kit in hand. The result
would be Austin Interval and Transitional-Late
Archaic middens that appear to be culturally
overprinted with Toyah debris (thin veneer
hypothesis, Black et al. 1997). These ideas account
for some possible aspects of culture change between
the Austin and the Toyah Intervals, instead of the
migration of peoples, and are consistent with the
archeological record.
The Toyah Bluff site provides no real answers
but accentuates the questions. There is compelling
data to suggest that the adoption of the lithic technocomplex occurred earlier in this area than is previously documented (ca. A.D. 1235). There is also
compelling evidence to suggest that groups with
Toyah affiliations (people or tools) had a greater
reliance on plant food processing than previously
thought. Better stratified and preserved sites which
contain definite individual components which date
to this time frame are necessary to thoroughly address these issues. These are certainly the types of
sites and sorts of research questions that should and
could be profitably addressed in any future research
dealing with the Austin/Toyah regional framework.

Radiocarbon Dating of a Deer Image from
the Lower Pecos River Region, Texas
Marvin W. Rowe

ABSTRACT
Organic carbon was extracted for radiocarbon analysis from a pigment sample removed from a small
pictograph in Seminole Canyon (Site 41 VV75) in the Lower Pecos River region of southwest Texas. The dated
figure is a dark, purple/red painting of a deer measuring approximately 10 to 20 cm in length. The sampled figure
is part of a larger panel of a series of eleven deer traveling upwards and to the right as one faces the panel. The
sample was taken from a highly degraded image using a new scalpel blade. Plasma-chemistry was used to extract
organic carbon. Because the background contamination from unpainted rock was negligible, the age is expected
to be reliable. However, as always with a single radiocarbon determination, caution is advised pending further
studies. Radiocarbon analysis provided an uncorrected age estimate of 1280 ± 80 years before present (B.P.).
This estimate is in close agreement with a previous age of 1280 ± 150 years B.P. obtained from a red-pigmented
Red Linear painting at another site in the area, 41 VV162A. The deer pictograph is approximately 1500 years
younger than almost all of the Pecos River genre paintings we have dated from the same shelter. It is most likely
of the Red Linear genre.

INTRODUCTION
The advent of tandem accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) for radiocarbon analysis greatly reduced the amount of carbon necessary for an age
estimate (Bennet et al. 1977; Muller 1977; Nelson et
al. 1977) so that even a small pictograph sample
might be dated. Over the past decade, radiocarbon
dates have been obtained from pictographs in several states, including Arizona (Armitage et al. 2000;
Panell and Burton 1992), California (Armitage et al.
1997), Missouri (Diaz-Granados et al. 2001), Montana (Chaffee et al. 1994a), Utah (Chaffee et al.
1994b; Geib and Fairley 1992), Wisconsin (Steelman,
Rowe, Boszhardt and Southon 2001 ), and several
locations in Texas (Chaffee et al. 1994c; Hyman et
al. 1999; Ilger et al. l 994a; 1995, 1996; Pace et al.
2000; Russ et al. 1990, 1992). Pictographs from several countries have been also dated, including Angola
(Ilger et al. 1995), Australia (Armitage et al. 1998;
David et al.1999, 2001), Belize (Rowe et al. 2001),
Brazil (Rowe and Steelman 2003), France (Ilger et
al. 1994b), Guatemala (Armitage et al. 2001), Mexico
(Ilger et al. 1995), and Russia (Steelman, Rowe,
Shirokov and Southon 2001).

The present study is concerned with pictographs
in the Lower Pecos River region of Val Verde
County, Texas. There are four prehistoric genres of
rock paintings in the Lower Pecos River region.
The most common and impressive style is polychrome Pecos River genre (Kirkland and Newcomb
1937; Grieder 1966; Turpin 1982). Nineteen
samples of this genre in a rockshelter at Site
41VV75 have been radiocarbon dated to the era
2750 to 4200 years B.P. (Chaffee et al. 1994c; Ilger
et al. 1995, 1996; Pace et al. 2000; Russ et al. 1990,
1992). A less common, but similar polychrome
Lower Pecos Bold Line Geometric style (Turpin
l 986a) has not yet been subjected to radiocarbon
analysis. A third genre is the much rarer Red Linear
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1937; Grieder 1966;
Turpin 1984, 1990) which is arguably the style
subject of this paper. Previously, one radiocarbon
age estimate of 1280 ± 150 years B.P. has been
obtained from a pictograph representing this genre
at Site 41VV162A (Ilger et al. 1994a). Finally, for
the fourth style, Red Monochrome (Kirkland and

on the presence of painted illustrations of bows and
arrows. One radiocarbon age estimate of 1125 ± 85
years B.P. has been obtained from a pictograph of
this style (Ilger et al. 1994a).
In the rockshelter site 41 VV75 in Seminole
Canyon State Historic Park there is a panel with
about eleven highly degraded pictographs of deer.
Each measures about 10-20 cm in length and the
series of deer seem to be progressing upward and to
the right of the shelter as one faces the images.
They are located near the center of the shelter.
Figure 1 shows one of the better-preserved images
of these deer; however, it is not the image studied
here. The image we sampled was one of the more
badly spalled of the group. This panel of deer does
not fit neatly into any of the four styles. Of the four
prehistoric genres, only Red Linear and Pecos River
styles are plausible for the deer paintings at
41 VV75. The deer are more realistic than is typical
for accepted Red Linear paintings, but the small
size is more characteristic of Red Linear style than
for Pecos River style, although small Pecos River

genre paintings do exist. Similar deer figures at
Panther Cave, White Shaman site, and Cedar
Springs are painted amidst many Pecos River style
paintings that are typically slightly larger in size.
No depictions of deer measuring a meter in size are
found in the Pecos River genre paintings. Welldefined images of the Pecos River style are often,
but not always large scale, i.e., meter size and larger.
The radiocarbon age estimated in this work is not
consistent with our earlier dates on Pecos River
genre paintings: nineteen radiocarbon determinations from 41 VV75 yield age estimates that range
from 2750 to 4200 years B.P., older than the age
estimate for the deer depiction dated here. On the
other hand, it agrees exactly with the one previous
radiocarbon age estimation for a Red Linear figure.

size of a dime was removed from the dark purple/
red deer figure approximately using a scalpel with
a new blade. The pictograph sample was deposited
directly onto a piece of aluminum foil, wrapped,
and sealed within a plastic bag. The painted motif
was photographed before and after sample collection. An unpainted stone sample nearby was also
taken to provide a background age determination.
The sample was taken to Texas A&M University and treated with lM NaOH for 30 minutes and
sonicated at 50°C to dissolve humic acids that could
potentially contaminate the sample. This is a conventional procedure used to remove humic acids
from archaeological charcoal before radiocarbon
dating (e.g., Bowman 1990). The NaOH-treated
charcoal samples were then rinsed with doubly distilled de-ionized water, filtered, and left to dry. The
dry residue was then deemed ready for plasmachemical extraction of the organic carbon for radiocarbon analysis.
We use radio-frequency generated, low temperature (-150°C) oxygen plasmas to remove organic material from paint samples, leaving the
substrate rock and accretion carbonates and oxalates intact. The organic carbon is then analyzed
by AMS. Since the introduction of our plasmachemical technique in 1990, we have demonstrated
its validity on numerous samples of known 14C
content. The dates we have obtained on rock paintings from Angola, Guatemala, France, Missouri,
Montana, Texas and Utah are consistent with the
age ranges expected from archaeological inference (see Rowe 2001). We have also dated nonpictograph sample materials with previously determined radiocarbon ages, including wood charcoal, wood samples used in the Third International Radiocarbon Laboratory Intercomparison, a
painted Egyptian ceramic, and African Ostrich
shell (see Hyman and Rowe 1997). Satisfactory
agreement among age estimates was observed in
all cases. Moreover, our analyses of 14 C-free
samples, such as graphite, Albertite, IAEA wood,
and Axel Heiberg wood, demonstrated that our
technique does not add significantly to the modern carbon background for AMS procedure.
We clean the system with oxygen plasmas before sample insertion to rid reaction surfaces of
organic contamination and/or adsorbed C02. After
the system was cleaned, the deer pictograph sample
was placed into the chamber. Argon plasmas were
then run to remove adsorbed co2 from the sample

85

by inelastic collision of the non-reactive, but high
energy, argon atoms with the adsorbed co2 molecules. With these precautions, negligible contamination is expected from the system or sample surfaces during plasma extraction of a pictograph
sample. After the sample was loaded into the plasma
chamber, the chamber was evacuated to below the
10-4 torr range and filled with 0.2 torr ultra-high
purity argon (99.999%). Argon plasmas were run
until the amount of carbon, as C02, desorbed by the
plasmas was ::;0.001 mg carbon. This amount of
carbon has a negligible effect on the estimate of
sample age. An oxygen plasma extracted organic
carbon from the charcoal paint sample from the
deer motif. The C02 produced was collected by
freezing in a liquid-nitrogen-cooled glass-finger and
sent to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry
(CAMS).

RESULTS
The radiocarbon content of the sample was measured at CAMS. The radiocarbon age could not be
corrected for isotopic fractionation because the
plasma extraction procedure does not yield sufficient sample mate1ial for the measurement of both
13 C and 14C. A standard 13 C value of -25 mil has
been assumed for this and previous radiocarbon age
determinations of rock art pigments. The uncorrected
age estimate was returned as 1280 ± 80 years B.P.
(CAMS # 29315). The calibrated age range for the
sample is 1290-1090 B.P. (A.D. 660-860) at ls and
1340-1000 B.P. (A.D. 610-950) at2s using the OxCal
calibration program (Ramsey 2000).

DISCUSSION
Turpin (1984, 1990, 1995) gave in-depth descriptions of the Red Linear rock paintings in the
Lower Pecos River region of southwest Texas and
discussed the age of the Red Linear style on the
basis of interpretation of cultural and faunal remains and their association with Red Linear rock
paintings. Turpin (1984:191) reported that, "Attempts to place the Red Linear in a chronological
perspective using stylistic attributes has produced
contradictory lines of evidence." She concluded
that Red Linear paintings date to the late Archaic,

86

but are more recent than Pecos River genre paintings. Further thought has apparently not changed
her view (Turpin 1990, 1995). One of Turpin's
arguments is largely based on the chronological
occurrence of documented remains of bison in the
Lower Pecos region (Dillehay 1974). Then, if the
scene at 41VV162A "commemorates a successful
bison kill, its most probable age is Late Archaic"
(Turpin 1984: 193). As Dillehay (1974: 184) stated,
"the documented extension of their range into the
Lower Pecos region during the Archaic period is
between 2600 and 1400 years ago." In general, it
seems that Turpin thus tentatively placed Red Linear between 2600 and 1400 years B.P. Ilger et al.
( 1994) determined a radiocarbon date of 1280 ±
150 years B.P. for one of the "bison" images at
41VV162A. That date barely overlaps within experimental error with the recent extreme, i.e., 1400
years B.P., of Turpin's estimate for the time range
of Red Linear paintings. The radiocarbon age estimate of the purple/red deer motif appears to be
consistent with the extreme lower age estimate for
the Red Linear genre (Turpin 1986a, 1995) and is
the same age as the one previous radiocarbon date
for that genre. Thus we conclude that the dated
deer motif in shelter 41 VV75 is contemporaneous
with the Red Linear style and was probably drawn
by the Red Linear people.

A Study of Two Ancient Bows from Trans-Pecos Texas
James E. Wiederhold, Harry J. Shafer, and Douglas Perrin

ABSTRACT
This paper presents the results of the Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) dating and the subsequent
analysis of two ancient wooden bows recovered from the Trans-Pecos region of Texas. One bow predates the
Apache intrusion into the area, and the other dates to very near or perhaps some years after the proposed time
of this intrusion. Analysis reveals that the culture and environment were the primary factors that molded the
design of these bows. The bows are compared to prehistoric and historic native bow forms of different
environments.

INTRODUCTION
Bow and arrow technology was a relatively
recent arrival prehistorically in Texas. Its introduction is assumed to coincide with the occurrence of smaller projectile points such as Scallorn
and other corner-notched styles (Hester 1980;
Prewitt 1983; Turner and Hester 1999). This conclusion is based at least in part on the idea that
the hafting elements of such points fit the diameter of an arrow (Christenson 1986; Hamilton
1982; Patterson 1985; Pyszczyk 1999; Thomas
1979). Hence, the question of the arrival of the
bow is generally established by means of indirect dating. The opportunity to date ancient bows
directly is seldom presented in the state, as is the
opportunity to study early bows of known dates.
Recently, however, two bows from rockshelters
or caves in southwest Texas were directly dated
using Accelerated Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating. One of the bows was found in
Terrell County and was dated to 545 +/- 40 B.P.
(CAL A.D. 1300-1440); the other came from
Presidio County and yielded a date of 190 +/- 40
B.P. (CAL A.D. 1640-1950). With the exception
of the American Southwest, few bows of this
age are available for study in North America,
and there is no study that we are aware of dealing with bows of this age from Texas. Furthermore, no study that we are aware of deals with
self-bows of this particular type, excepting the
work of Baker (1994 ). This paper presents an

analysis' of the two bows, including an overview
of the environment they came from, how they
were manufactured, and more importantly, why
they were built the way they were. A comparison of these bows to types from other regions of
North America and other parts of the world is
also provided.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE BOW
IN NORTH AMERICA
The following brief chronology of the bow in
North America will serve to provide at least some
background for the bows analyzed in this paper. It
generally follows Blitz (1988). The earliest evidence comes from the Arctic where a microblade
technology from 9000 to 6000 B.C. may be paralleled with Old World Mesolithic usage as arrow
barbs; however, clear evidence for the bow only
occurs after 3000 B.C., with initial dates appearing
in the western Arctic and later dates appearing in a
progression from west to east. Interestingly, Blitz
reports the occurrence of small recurved composite
bows made of antler from the central Canadian
arctic of the Pre-Dorset period (2500-800 B.C.).
These composite bows are short and are manufactured with glue and sinew, implying a sound knowledge of bowyer technology as well as a probable tie
to Asia where this type of bow reached a high level
of technical sophistication by historic times
(McEwen et al. 1991).

Blitz judges from the archaeological evidence
that the microblade arrow barbs of the Arctic and
Old World Mesolithic contexts were replaced by
small bifacially flaked arrow points prior to the
appearance of the bow south of the boreal forests.
Furthermore, he finds that the best evidence for the
earliest appearance of the bow south of the boreal
forests occurs at around A.D. 200 in the Great Basin and Intermontane West and the Northern Plains
of Saskatchewan and Alberta. In other regions of
North America, including the Pacific Northwest
and California, the Great Lakes and Northeastern
Woodlands, the Midwest and Southeast, and the
Plains, all archaeological evidence points to a date
of A.D. 500 or later for the introduction of the bow.
LeBlanc (1999:101) suggests the self-bow came
into the northern Southwest about A.D. 200, but
other evidence places its introduction in the southern Southwest about A.D. 700-800 (Dockall 1991;
Shafer 2003). Regarding Texas, Blitz cites separate
works by Aten (1984) and Hester (1977) that propose dates of A.D. 500-600 for the Upper Texas
Coastal Plain and A.D. 1200 for South Texas and
the Rio Grande Valley, respectively (Blitz
1988:127-131). Prewitt (1983) offers compelling
radiocarbon evidence tracing the slow movement
of corner-notched Scallorn arrow points and Austin
phase diagnostics from north to south across the
central part of the state. According to Prewitt' s
estimates, the bow appears in south and southwest
Texas about A. D. 800-900. A date of A.D. 1000
has been suggested for the Lower Pecos (Shafer
1981:130).
Blitz concludes from his survey that although
the bow was used for many centuries in the Arctic,
once south of the boreal forest its spread was rapid,
implying diffusion from north to south rather than
episodes of independent invention. He also states
that archaeologists have used point size as the primary indicator of the advent of the bow, except in
rare cases where bows and arrows are found in the
archaeological record (Blitz 1988:131-132). The
present paper is not intended to be a critical review
of Blitz's work but is used to provide some chronological background for the description and analysis
of two rare archaeological bows from Southwest
Texas. However, there is a point in Blitz's argument that should raise questions about the diffusion of the bow from the Arctic to the rest of the
continent. Blitz states that the archaeological bows
found in the Arctic are composite horn bows whose

mrnws were likely tipped with composite points
utilizing microblades. He further states that once
south of the boreal forest bifacially flaked points
replaced the composite points. However, the earliest
known archaeological bows south of the boreal forest are not composite horn bows but self-bows made
of a single stave of wood, as are the bows in the
present study. Hom composite bows probably appeared south of the boreal forest only after A.D.1700
and likely coincided with the use of horses (Hamilton
1982:92-93). This, taken together with the long period of time between the appearance of the bow in
the Arctic and the appearance of a very different
type of bow along with a different type of arrow
point in more southern regions, may call his theory
of diffusion from the Arctic into question.

SOUTHWEST TEXAS
ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Doug Perrin of Denton, Texas and his father, Mr. Leonard Perrin, found the older of the two
bows while hunting deer in Terrell County in November of 1994. Doug Perrin found the bow lying
on a shelf at the back of a small solution cave in a
sheer bluff some six or seven meters above the
bottom of a dry creek. The locality was just to the
east of Sanderson Canyon and about one and a
quarter kilometers north of the Rio Grande. One
end of the bow was wedged into a crevice where
the cave pinched out. In removing the bow from the
crevice, Perrin unfortunately broke off one end of
the bow; however, the break occurred so that the
two pieces refit cleanly. In addition, the break facilitated the extraction of small samples of wood
for both identification and dating purposes. He
found nothing else in the cave.
The second bow dated in this study is in the
Dan Knight Collection, which was donated to the
University of Texas before 1936 and is now housed
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, Texas. This bow was found,
also in a cave, in Presidio County about sixteen
miles southwest of Marfa along with a fragmentary
grass mat. Like the Perrin bow, it was broken, but
in this case one end is missing.
Their m·chaeological locations place these bows
in the Chihuahuan biotic province in Trans-Pecos
Texas (Blair 1950). The province is characterized
by a great diversity of physiographic features. It

Wiederhold, Shafer, and Perrin-A Study of Two Ancient Bows from Trans-Pecos Texas

includes the Toyah Basin, whose eastern rim makes
up the eastern boundary of the province, and the
Stockton Plateau, an extension of the Edwards Plateau limestone. Alternating basins and mountain
ranges of diverse composition and origin make up
the rest of the topography of the province. The
physiographic diversity results in a flora and fauna
that vary largely according to altitude and proximity to water. Climate is classified as arid (Blair
1950: 105-107).
Vegetation is described as a shrub-short grass
savanna. Creosote bush, acacia, yucca, prickly pear,
lechuguilla, sotol, desert hackberry, and Texas persimmon are present on uplands adjacent to deep,
narrow canyons capable of supporting various oaks,
mesquite, native pecan, cottonwood, and little-leaf
walnut (Bandy et al. 1980; Dering 1999; Marmaduke 1978). Elevated plains of the more mountainous regions support a good cover of grama grasses
while thorny shrubs dominate the foothills. Oak
and cedar occur at higher elevations in some of the
mountain ranges, as do pines and relict stands of
hardwoods. The composition of these higher altitude associations vary from mountain mass to mountain mass and include ponderosa pine, white pine,
Douglas fir, Arizona cypress, quaking aspen, and
bigtooth maple (Blair 1950; Marmaduke 1978).
Animals also vary in accordance with the diverse habitats provided by the aforementioned physiographic features of the region. Some ninety-two
species of mammals occur in the Trans-Pecos. About
one third of these (of which all but two are rodents)
are restricted to the region, giving it the greatest
number of unique species in the mammalian fauna
of Texas (Davis and Schmidly 1994:5). Principal
species of the region include white-tailed deer, mule
deer, jackrabbit, desert cottontail, squirrel, javelina,
raccoon, fox, skunk, ringtail, badger, black bear,
porcupine, coyote, bobcat, and cougar. There is also
a wide variety of lizards and snakes. Bison, antelope, elk, and mountain sheep were present in late
prehistoric and early historic times (Bandy et al.
1980; Blair 1950; Davis and Schmidly 1994).

THE REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY
Evidence of all four of the. major divisions of
the prehistory of North America is present in the
Trans-Pecos of Texas. The Paleo-Indian era is
known from the projectile point types Clovis,

91

Folsom, and Plainview. The drives of extinct forms
of bison as evidenced by the association of their
bones with Folsom and Plainview points in Bone
Bed 2 at Bonfire Shelter demonstrate Paleo-Indian
reliance on the hunting of big game as an economic
pursuit (Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Marmaduke
1978). Furthermore, these people were not likely
permanent residents but instead followed the migratory patterns of the large game animals that provided their subsistence. Only traces of their existence are found in the region, generally in the form
of projectile points in surface finds for the most
part (Shafer 1981).
A major climatic shift occurred at the end of
the Pleistocene in the Trans-Pecos that defines the
beginning of the Archaic. The marginal desert conditions began about 9500 B.P. and persisted until
historic times. Although punctuated by shorter climatic intervals, both xeric and mesic, the climate
persisted, giving rise to a long-lived, conservative
economy well adapted to the environment. This
adaptation emphasized the use of a wide range of
food sources, including some deer hunting, but
mostly the exploitation of small animals such as
rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, snakes, and fish (Williams-Dean 1978; Lord 1984). More important was
the use of plants, especially desert succulents such
as sotol, lechuguilla, and yucca (Marmaduke 1978;
Shafer 1981; Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983).
While the transition between the Paleo-Indian
and Archaic eras is marked by a climatic and environmental shift, the Late Prehistoric era is introduced by a technological shift that does not occur
simultaneously throughout the region. In fact, the
actual technological innovations that signal the shift
are not all the same. Generally, most agree that the
manufacture of pottery, the development of agriculture, the establishment of villages, and the use
of the bow and arrow mark the Late Prehistoric in
Texas. It is obvious, however, from the archaeological record that not all of these traits occurred in
the Trans-Pecos at the same time, nor were they all
adopted throughout the region. Thus, the beginning
of the Late Prehistoric in the Trans-Pecos is highly
variable. Corn, for example, was introduced in far
west Texas as early as about 1500 B.C. (Tagg 1996).
Brownware pottery and corn/beans/squash agriculture appear in the far western portion of the TranPecos in the Hueco Balson around El Paso as early
as A.D. 400 (Miller 1995; Shafer et al. 1999). In
the La Junta district, around the confluence of the

92

Texas Archeological Society

Rio Conchos and the Rio Grande, agriculture and
pottery occur probably somewhat later although
their arrival in this part of the region remains undated. Villages with pithouses and later pueblostyle houses were developed in both areas as well
(Boisvert 1985; Cloud et al. 1994; Lehmer 1958;
Shafer et al. 1999). On the other hand, in the eastern Trans-Pecos, agriculture was not a factor, and
ceramics appear very late in the prehistoric sequence, possibly not until about A. D. 1700. Projectile points are the primary temporal markers,
and the nomadic hunting and gathering way of life
remained much the same until the Historic period
(Shafer 1981).
The Post-contact period in the Trans-Pecos began when Cabeza de Vaca crossed the area in A.D.
1535. While his exact route remains a source of
controversy, it is known that he passed through La
Junta de los Rios (Cloud et al. 1994). Early Spanish
entradas following the Rio Conchos north out of
Mexico passed through the La Junta district as well.
The Spanish came into contact with various groups
called Jumanos, Julimes, and possibly Gediondos
(Wade 2003). The Jumanos seem to have been
widely distributed in time and space, but exactly to

whom the name applies is a subject for debate.
Other early historic groups who may have inhabited the region include the Chisos groups from the
Big Bend area, the Tobosos, and various other
groups and bands (Griffen 1969; Kenmotsu 1994).
By A.D. 1680, Apaches were present in the TransPecos as a result of their displacement from the
Southern Plains by the Comanches moving down
from eastern Colorado and western Kansas. This,
together with native wars and turmoil caused by
Spanish colonization, virtually eliminated these
early groups by death, displacement, or assimilation (Bandy et al. 1980; Boisvert 1985; Cloud et al.
1994; Marmaduke 1978; Shafer 1971, 1981).

THE BOWS
This section of the paper presents a physical
description and analysis of the manufacture of the
bows. The reader is encouraged to examine the
drawing in Figure 1 in order to be familiar with the
common archery terms used in the following description. Both these bows can be classified as selfbows because they are made from s single wooden
stave. Self-bows are also generally considered to be long bows
(Baker 1992; Hamilton 1982).

As mentioned earlier, the Perrin
bow was found in a cave in Terrell
County about one mile east of
Sanderson Canyon and one mile
north of the Rio Grande (Figure
2). A wood sample collected from
the specimen yielded a radiocarbon age estimate of 545 +/- 40
B.P. (CAL A.D. 1300-1440), making it the older of the two specimens. The length of the bow from
tip to tip is 162.5 cm while the
length along the curve of the limbs
is approximately 173 cm. This difference illustrates the fact that the
limb tips are considerably deflexed, meaning they are bent toward the belly of the bow. A measurement of this deflection was
obtained by placing a straight edge

metric measures).

at the back of the handle, or grip area, and adjusting
the bow so that if it were strung, the bowstring
would be parallel to the straight edge. The distance
was then measured from each tip to the line of the
straight edge. The nock end tip measured 20.6 cm
from the line, and the other end measured 23.6

93

cm. While this is an estimate, it does give further
indication of the amount of deflex in the limbs.
Although self-bows commonly exhibit some deflex
(especially after sustaining numerous episodes of
use), this amount of deflex is significant because it
is specific to xeric environments where trees large
enough to provide good bow staves are scarce.
Larger trees can produce staves with fewer knots
and more importantly, bows with flatter, wider
backs and bellies. The flatter, wider morphology
spreads the forces of both tension and compression
across the width of the bow instead of concentrating these forces down the very longitudinal center
of the limbs, as in the case of the rounded cross
section of the bows in the present study. Many
Native American bows, as well as Neolithic bows
from Europe, are flat and relatively wide, being
rectangular or trapezoidal in cross section. Some
were built to have a narrower but thicker handle,
which prevents the bow from bending through the
handle and forces the limbs to do more work, resulting in reduced shock to the bow hand and improved cast. This type of self-bow has been proven
to be an efficient and durable design, especially
when made of resilient woods such as yew, elm,
hickory, or bois d'arc (Allely and Hamm 1999;
Baker 1992, 1994; Bergman 1993; Comstock 1993;
Hamilton 1982).
Most self-bows from more mesic environments
are either straight or somewhat reflexed when
unbraced although as stated above, many so-called
straight bows retain a slight deflex. This phenomenon is called "string follow" or "taking a set" and
occurs because wood is weaker under compression
than it is under tension. Wood on the belly of the
bow does not totally recover from the forces of
compression placed on it when the bow is braced,
drawn, and shot. Most self-bows will exhibit
deflexion to some degree, and most archers who
shoot this type of bow generally feel that a certain
amount of string follow, about 2.5-6.5 cm, is acceptable and can cut down on hand shock when the
drawn bow is released and snaps back to its braced
position (Baker 1992). The Perrin bow is not only
deflexed significantly more than is normal for the
so-called straight limb self-bows, but also the limbs
are deflexed asymmetrically. Although the nock
end measures about 3 cm less deflex than the other
end, the deflex is sharper (Figure 2).
As mentioned previously, one limb tip has a
nock cut in .6 cm from the end (Figure 3a). The

nock is on one side only and measures .3 cm wide
and .25 cm deep, which means it was probably tied
when the bow was braced instead of using a fixed
loop. The bowstring would have been tied on the
unnocked end either with a series of half hitches
where the taper of the limb would prevent slippage
or with a wrapping of sinew or rawhide used as a
shoulder to provide support for the knots. The bowstring would likely have been tied on the nock end
also since the nock is only a groove on one side.
The lack of a groove circumscribing the tip would
seem to make it difficult for the more familiar fixed
loop to hold without slipping. This seems to suggest that the bow may possibly have been braced
for extended periods of time, perhaps a cause of the
amount of "set" or deflex in the limbs.
At the center, or what one would assume is the
handle, the Perrin bow measures 2.6 cm in width
and 3.1 cm in thickness. From here, both limbs
taper toward the tips. The tip on the nock end measures approximately 1.1 cm wide and 1.1 cm thick.

The tip at the other end measures roughly 1.0 cm
wide and 1.3 cm thick. This bow was evidently
constructed from a limb or possibly a small tree or
sapling. J. Phil Dering of Texas A&M University
has identified the wood as Juglans microcarpa,
commonly known as little-leaf walnut (Dering, personal communication, 2001). Dering describes these
trees as often having multiple stems so that a fairly
straight sapling could be obtained rather easily. Both
ends of the bow were worked down to produce the
taper that the limbs possess although obviously more
wood was removed from the larger end. Most of
the wood was removed from the sides and belly of
the bow so that the li.mbs would bend evenly without breaking, a process is known as "tillering" the
bow. When a bow is bending properly for the maximum amount of cast and the least amount of hand
shock, it said to have the correct "tiller." The smallness of the limb tips reduces mass at the part of the
limb that has to travel the farthest, allowing the tips
to travel the distance from full draw back to braced

Wiederhold, Shafer, and Perrin-A Study of Two Ancient Bows from Trans-Pecos Texas
position faster, thereby increasing arrow speed and
efficiency of the bow (Baker 1992, 1994).
It is evident upon examination that the bowyer
took a fair amount of care in working the back of
the bow. Figure 3b is a close view of a knot that
occurs on the back of the bow, showing that instead
of scraping the knot down flush with the back, the
bowyer left wood around the knot to strengthen the
limb in this area. Knots on the back of such a bow
are prime places for the bow limb to break under
forces of tension. Furthermore, the great majority
of the knots are on the belly where they are not so
critical to the performance of the bow, and the
bowyer could simply more or less disregard them
when he tillered the bow. This suggests that the
bowyer was more than a little familiar with the
properties of the wood and more specifically, with
how these properties reacted to the stresses placed
on the wood when used in a self-bow. The effects
of age on the wood of the bow (including signs of
rodent gnawing) make it difficult to tell whether
the bowyer exposed and followed one growth ring
along the back. Following one growth ring adds
strength and durability to the back of the bow when
it is placed under tension, thereby making the bow
more efficient and powerful as well as durable.
Although it is likely that the bowyer may have
violated the growth ring along the back given the
cross section and diameter of the bow, it is evident
that most of the shaping work was done on the
belly and sides. This was done in order to conserve
the integrity of the growth ring as much as possible,
and further suggests the expertise of the bowyer.
Another indication of the bowyer's work is a
trace of what apparently was a sinew and/or rawhide wrapping around the circumference of the limb
about 55 cm from the unnocked end (Figure 3c).
This wrapping was needed because the wood grain
on the back had separated under tension and had
begun to lift. Sinew is very capable of preventing
any further lifting of the grain that would lead to
limb failure and breakage. The senior co-author's
daughter currently shoots an elm self-bow having
the same problem. A bowyer friend corrected the
problem using the same type of sinew wrap as the
one observed on the Perrin bow.
The deflex in the bow limbs has been described
earlier. At the present stage of this study, it is impossible to tell how this deflex occurred. The most
apparent explanation is that because of the way that
the bow was tillered, forces of compression caused

95

the bow to take a large degree of set, especially if it
had remained braced for long periods of time. The
bow does exhibit compression cracks on the belly.
If the bow were left in the cave braced until the
bowstring decayed or was eaten by rodents, it would
undoubtedly stay in the deflexed shape in which it
was found. The type of wood from which the bow
was manufactured could also be a factor as well as
the amount of curing time given before the bow
was put into service. In his discussion of bows from
Africa, Longman and Walrond (1894) relate that
this type of bow is prevalent across time and space,
dating as far back as ancient Egypt. They cite ethnographic accounts stating that the bowstring is
permanently fixed on both ends after the bow is
saturated with oil and bent to the deflexed shape
over a fire (Longman and Walrond 1894). This is
another possibility. It is likely that the deflexed
limbs observed in both the Perrin bow and the
Knight bow were purposefully shaped this way.
The Knight Bow
As mentioned earlier, this bow is Item #51 in
the Dan Knight Collection now housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas (Figure 4). A wood sample taken from
the specimen yielded a radiocarbon age estimate of
190 +/- 40 B.P. (CAL A.D. 1640-1950). Like the
Perrin bow, it too was found in a cave, and further,
its shape and method of manufacture are very similar to the Perrin bow. The distal portion of one limb
is broken and missing. The length of the part remaining is 118 cm from limb tip to the break and
119.8 cm along the curve. In order to obtain a more
meaningful idea of the length of this bow, the direct
length from tip to tip and the length along the curve
were estimated by following the curve of the limbs.
The estimated length of the bow is about 133 cm
from tip to tip and 137 cm along the curve, which is
roughly some 40 cm shorter than the Perrin bow.
The width of the estimated center of the bow is 2.5
cm, and the thickness here is 2.2 cm. This is also
the thickest and widest part of the bow. The complete end of the bow has a partial nock grooved in
on one side about one cm from the tip. The groove
is about .25 cm wide and .1 cm deep. The complete
limb tip is .9 cm wide and .95 cm thick.
The bow has a longitudinal split on the belly
for most of its length. This could have occurred due
to drying; nonetheless, it would have little effect on

likely that the hole just described occurred during
the bow's use-life.
There is a darkened or stained area on the lateral aspect about 27 cm from the broken end, another area 8 cm long on the opposite side near
where the handle would be, and still another on the
back about 14 cm long also near the handle area.
On the complete limb, while all edges still show
some convexity, there are indications of flattening,
especiaily from the limb tip to about 34-35 cm in
toward the center. The scraping marks of the tool
used to tiller this limb can be observed.
Referring again to Figure 4 and to Figure 6,
one can see a slight recurve in the complete tip. A
recurved tip generally improves cast and efficiency

compression cracks on the belly. There is a crack

back about 9 cm from the broken end at a raised

crack also originates. The hole is about .2 cm in

differences would be rather meaningless. The impression one gets, however, is that the slight differences in width and thickness are largely a factor of the difference in length as well as the respective sizes of the saplings from which the bows
were manufactured.

DISCUSSION

especially in a shorter bow. This recurve, however,
is so slight that in this case the improvement it
lends to the bow is more in the nature of maintaining a straighter limb with less set or string follow
while still retaining the small tips. This in itself
would have increased the efficiency of the bow and
also may account for the 40 cm difference in length
since recurved limbs can be shorter than straight
limbs with less risk of breakage. It was not determined how the recurve was placed in the bow limb
tip. It could have been the natural way the limb
grew; it could have been shaped with moist heat; or
it could have been formed when the bow wood was
green. Regarding the bow wood, a determination of
the particular tree from which this bow was made
was not possible. Table l presents a quick comparison of the dimensions of the two bows.
The values for some dimensions of the Knight
bow are estimates because of the broken end. Given
the small sample size, statistical tests to determine
the significance of the observed dimensional

In the descriptions of these bows, much emphasis has been placed on the amount of deflex in the
limbs. This type of side-view profile is generally
thought of by bowyers and archers alike to be inefficient and generally poor. Thus, the question here is
why would native peoples who must have depended
on the bow and arrow for at least a part of their
subsistence design such a bow. Or do these bows
appear so simply because they entered the archaeological record braced and the long period of time it
took for the bowstring to deteriorate caused them to
take an excessive amount of set? Longman and
Walrond (1894) describe native peoples of Africa
and other parts of the world as keeping their bows
braced by tying the bowstiing on both ends, which
forces the bows into deflex. They imply that these
people did not have the knowledge or expertise to
build bows correctly. It must be realized that they
were writing at a time when western European and
American bowyers and archers felt that the Englishstyle longbow was the epitome of the bowyer's art
and compared bows from any and all cultures to
their idea of a perfect bow. Saxton Pope thought
much the same way in comparing bows in his famous work of 1923 (Pope 1962). The problem with
these studies is that they attempted to analyze bows
from different cultures out of context. An artifact
such as a bow must be studied in the context of the
culture that produced it (Baker 1992, 1994; Bergman
et al. 1988; McEwen et al. 1991).
There is little doubt that the design of the bows
in this study was no accident, nor were the bows
manufactured out of ignorance. Instead, they were
most likely weapons perfectly capable of performing what was required of them in the arid, unchanging environment of Trans-Pecos Texas. First of all,
large trees of resilient, elastic wood capable of producing wider, flatter, and thus more efficient bows
are scarce. Furthermore, it is easier to make bows
with rounded cross sections using stone tools than
bows with rectangular cross sections, especially if
it is necessary to use small trees. Attempting to

flatten the back of a bow made from limbs or
saplings such as the ones in this study would only
serve to cut through growth rings to such a degree
as to insure failure. Another factor that one must
consider is the dry climate. Low humidity means
low moisture content in the wood, making it less
elastic, and is probably the prime cause of the deflexed limb profile of these bows. When braced,
their profile would remain the same as when they
were unbraced, thus putting less strain on the limbs.
In other words, the force upon the limbs of such a
bow is only exerted when the bow is drawn. Therefore, a straight or reflexed profile bow in such low
humidity would be much more likely to break.
While it is true that deflexed bows are less efficient
than straight or reflexed bows, they should be well
capable of killing at least deer-sized game.

DATING THE BOWS
Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating provided a means of directly dating
the specimens that required only a trace of organic
material (i.e., as small as 50 micrograms). This
method is used to date small or valuable samples.
Small pieces of wood were extracted from each
bow and sent to the AMS National Science Foundation Laboratory at the University of Arizona. The
results are presented in Table 2.
The 2-sigma, calibrated age range for the Perrin
bow is AD. 1300-1440, which places it clearly in
the Late Prehistoric period. It can not be considered
an early example of a self-bow because the bow

and arrow had been in use in this region for at least
400 years, if not longer. Given this early date, it is
not possible to determine cultural affiliation.
The calibrated age estimate for the Knight bow
is AD. 1640-1950 and thus this bow be attributed to
the Historic period of this part of the state. While the
bow could have been used by Apache groups, there
are a number of other groups in the Presidio County
region that could have been responsible for the manufacture of this bow, including Julimes and Jumanos,
among others (Kenmotsu 1994; Wade 2003).

CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTED
FURTHER STUDIES
The bows in the present study have presented
an excellent opportunity for directly dating two artifacts that represent a rare type in Texas and in
North America in general. The bows were further
analyzed regarding dimension, bow type, and the
bowyer's work, all related to the type of environment where bows such as these are found. Deflexed
bows, such as those in this study, are found mostly
in more arid environments used by hunters on foot.
They are completely different from, and in most
cases, predate the familiar Plains bow which was
short, definitely adapted to horseback use, and was
often backed in its entire length with sinew
(Hamilton 1982). They are also different from the
long bows of more temperate regions of N01th
America, such as those of the Eastern Woodlands
peoples, whose bows are self-bows but are generally flat in cross section and straight to slightly

deflexed in profile. One of the best examples of the
bowyer's art from this region of North America is
the famous Sudbury bow collected in 1660 in
Sudbury, Massachusetts, and now in the Peabody
Museum. This hickory bow is thick and narrow in
the handle, wide and flat through the limbs, and
tapering toward the tips. Bowyers and archers (including Saxton Pope) who have studied and replicated the bow consider it perhaps one of the most
well designed bows ever made (Baker 1994;
Hamilton 1982). However, it is doubtful that the
Sudbury could have been manufactured or used in
the environment of the Texas Trans-Pecos in Late
Prehistoric times. In his review of bows from different parts of the world, Baker sums it up succinctly. In discussing deflex-tip bows, he states,
"As much as any other, this bow demonstrates the
precision with which cultures molded bow designs
to their particular needs" (Baker 1994:63).
Regarding the dates of the bows in the present
study, the Perrin bow dating to A.D.1405±40 is a
very good example of an indigenous weapon that
predates European contact. The Knight bow dating to 1760±40 could possibly have been in use
around the time of the Apache intrusion into the
Trans-Pecos. The fact that it is substantially
shorter than the Perrin bow and that the remaining tip has a slight reflex may indicate a shift in
the way bows were being built. This is far from
conclusive, however. The bows still have much
in common. More bows from this region need to
be documented and studied. Another avenue to
pursue is replication of bows of this type. Be-

cause of their conjectured relative inefficiency
compared to other types of bows, few bowyers
today have replicated them.
In addition to replication of these bows, performance tests similar in approach to those of
Bergman et al. (1988) are also in order. These
researchers took Pope's study of 1923 to the next
logical step, conducting performance tests on seven
bow types from around the world including an
African self-bow of the type discussed above.
While this bow is very similar to the bows of the
present study, there are differences. Self-bows
from the Trans-Pecos, including those in the
present study, should be replicated and performance tested at every opportunity, as well as being analyzed and dated. Bows from the archaeological record should be closely studied whenever
possible, and in so doing, we will learn something
of the culture that produced them.

Detecting Historic Indian SitesThe Case for Metal Detecting as an Archeological Strategy
J. Brett Cruse

ABSTRACT
The Southern Plains were inhabited by a number ofindian groups during the Historic Period. Historic Indian
sites, however, represent only about one percent of the 5,800 recorded archeological sites from a study sample
of72 Texas counties located in the Southern Plains. Of the 61 recorded historic Indian sites in the study sample,
only 29 were recorded by professional archeologists. This paper proposes that historic Indian sites are being
largely overlooked by professional archeologists due to inadequate survey and identification techniques. These
techniques are considered inadequate because they are primarily designed to identify prehistoric sites that are
marked by lithic and ceramic artifacts, which were largely replaced in the Historic Period by metal items acquired
through trade with Europeans. This study examines the documentary and archeological evidence for the use and
incorporation of European trade goods, particularly metal items, into the material culture of the historic Southern
Plains Indians, and concludes that in order to identify historic Indian sites, professional archeologists must
incorporate the use of metal detectors into their survey and site evaluation methods.

INTRODUCTION
During the latter part of the Historic Period on
the Southern Plains (after ca. A.D. 1700), the region
from southern Kansas to central Texas was occupied
by various Indian groups including the Apaches,
Kiowas, Kiowa-Apaches, Comanches, Southern
Cheyennes, Arapahos, and others. The occupation of
the region by these historic Indians is well documented in the journals of early explorers, naturalists,
members of military expeditions, and in the oral histories and calendars of some of the Indian groups
themselves. While archeologists working in the region have recorded, documented, and excavated numerous locations that were occupied by prehistoric
Indian groups, comparatively few historic Indian sites
have been investigated or even identified in the region by professional archeologists.
The argument could be made that so few historic Indian sites have been identified because the
historic Indians occupied the region for a relatively
brief time, only about 200 years. Thus, the argument
would conclude, a brief occupation period would
result in a low number of sites. Still others might
argue that because the hist01ic Indian groups were so
mobile and they occupied locations for only brief

periods, little evidence of their occupation would be
left for archeologists to find. While both of these
arguments have merit, they do not adequately account for the small number of historic Indian sites
that archeologists have recorded in the region.
The fact that the historic Indians were so mobile after the adoption of horses would suggest that
numerous locations would have been utilized as
camp and village sites. At each site location the
occupants would have built fires, erected shelters,
processed foods, and made or repaired tools. Each
of these activities should leave some kind of residue or evidence of its occurrence. In other words,
the historic Indians of the Southern Plains were
doing the same basic kinds of activities as their
prehistoric predecessors. If that is the case, why
have so few of their sites been identified? The primary cause appears to be the inadequate survey and
identification techniques currently used by archeologists. These techniques are designed to identify
prehistoric sites by discovering the debris and tools
the prehistoric groups used and left at a site, namely
lithic and ceramic items. During the Historic Period, however, lithic and ceramic tools were gradually replaced by items, primarily metal, acquired
through trade with Europeans. Therefore, different

HISTORIC INDIANS ON THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS
The Historic Period on the Southern Plains was marked by dramatic
and revolutionary changes in material culture and population movement. The influx of Europeans into
the region and all the things they
brought with them-including
horses, firearms, and diseases-set
into motion a series of events that
would change the cultural fabric of
the region forever, and ultimately resulted in the permanent relocation or
removal of the Indian tribes. Though
European contact was first made with
Indian groups on the Southern Plains
by the Coronado Expedition in 1541,
the Spanish presence in the Southwest did not have a substantial impact until about 1600 when Spaniards became permanently established in New Mexico. The Apache
were dominant on the Southern Plains
at the time of the Coronado Expedition, but other groups such as the
Teyas and Jumanos also occupied
the region. The Southern Plains Indian groups at this time were nomadic hunters and gatherers who reFigure 1. The study sample of Texas counties within the Southern Plains.

quire horses. This point is illustrated by the report

Cruse-Detecting Historic Indian Sites
of Fray Alonso de Posada who was in charge of the
mission at Pecos in the 1650s. He noted in his
report that the Apaches brought bison robes and
captives to the mission to trade for horses (Tyler
and Taylor 1958:301-303). It appears that by A.D.
1700, most Southern Plains groups had adopted an
equestrian lifestyle (Secoy 1953; Worcester 1944).
With the acquisition of the horse came revolutionary changes to the cultures of the Southern
Plains. Groups suddenly became highly mobile and
were able to travel long distances and over large
areas. Cultural boundaries began to break down, as
groups who had traditionally pursued a foraging
existence on the margins of the Plains now moved
onto the Plains where they became specialized bison hunters. One of these groups was the Comanche,
who began to move into the region from the northwest in the early 1700s. The Comanches eventually
displaced all of the previous occupants of the Southern Plains and established relatively unrestricted
access to European goods from two separate
sources-the Spanish to the west and the French to
the east. In 1705 the Comanches made their fist
recorded visit to Taos Pueblo to trade, and in 1709
they made a formal agreement with New Mexico
that allowed them to trade at Taos (Kenner 1969:28).
That the Comanche trade with the Spanish quickly
became well established is evident in numerous
Spanish documents of the period. Don Pedro Rivera,
for example, in a report published in 1736, observed that the Comanches appeared annually in
New Mexico to trade (Kenner 1969:36).
The Spaniards in New Mexico were the only
practical source of European goods for the
Comanches until the 1740s when they began to
have indirect access to French traders to the east. In
1746 the Comanches allied with the Wichitas who
were concentrated in settlements along the Red
River in present central and southern Oklahoma.
The Wichitas were involved in trade with the French
who controlled Louisiana and who had established
a trading post in 1714 on the Red River among the
Natchitoches Indians (Gilmore 1992:124). That the
Wichitas traded with the French is evident in the
frequency of European artifacts in Wichita sites
dating between 1700 and 1760 (Bell 1984:376-377;
Hofman 1989; Perttula 1992). Documentary evidence that the Comanches acquired French trade
items from the Wichitas comes from Fray Francisco Atanasio Dominguez who described a Taos
trade fair in 1776. Of the fair, he states:

105

They [the Comanches] also sell good
guns, pistols, powder, balls, tobacco,
hatchets, and some vessels of yellow tin
(some large, others small) shaped like
the crown of the friars' hats .... They acquire these articles, from the guns to the
vessels, from the Jumanas Indians, who
have direct communication and trade
with the French, from who they buy them
(Adams and Chavez 1956:252; brackets
added).
The Jumanas Indians to which Fray Dominguez
refers were actually the Wichita (Scholes and Mera
1940).
In 1786 New Mexico Governor Juan Bautista
de Anza negotiated a long-lasting peace with the
Comanches who had been raiding the New Mexican
settlements. Because of the peace, exchange between the New Mexicans and the Comanches and
other Southern Plains Indians broadened in scope.
At the same time, Hispanic settlements began to be
established along the Pecos River to the east of
Pecos Pueblo. The New Mexican settlers were attracted to the Pecos River lands not only because of
their value for grazing, but also because of their
proximity to the Comanche trade. Many New Mexican traders began to venture onto the plains in an
effort to take the trade to the Plains Indians. This
"Comanchero" trade soon replaced the trade fairs
that had been traditionally held at Taos and Pecos
(Kenner 1969; Levine and Freeman 1982).
The number of documentary records describing Comancheros increased significantly after the
opening of trade along the Santa Fe Trail in 1821.
Stephen Long, who explored New Mexico and West
Texas in 1819 and 1820, noted well-worn trails
following the Canadian River from New Mexico to
the Plains (Kenner 1969:80). Other American military explorers of the mid-1800s, such as Abert
(1846), Marcy (1850), and Simpson (1850), traveled across the Plains following well-established
cart roads that they attributed to Comancheros. During the third quarter of the nineteenth century, other
military personnel who were trying to find ways to
safely travel across the seemingly endless Llano
Estacada, and later attempting to track the
Comanches to their camps on the Llano Estacada,
documented and mapped Indian and Comanchero
trails, water sources, and camps throughout the
Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico (e.g.,

Country Scouted by Colonel McKenzie [sic] and
Shafter, Capt. R. P. Wilson and Others in the Years
1874 & 1875, Record Group 77, National Archives).

While the Comanches dominated a large portion of the Southern Plains during the Historic Period and are mentioned more often than others in
connection with the Comanchero trade (hence the
name), other Indian groups also occupied the region. The Kiowas, who had been pushed by the
Dakota Indians from the Black Hills region of
present South Dakota and Wyoming, occupied the
area of the upper Arkansas in the late 1700s and
early 1800s. From this area, the Kiowas were successful at pushing the Comanches further to the
south. Though early hostilities existed between the
Kiowas and Comanches, they became allies, probably around 1790 (Mayhall 1962: 15). A similar
alliance was made with the Southern Cheyennes
and Arapahos in 1840 (Grinnell 1956). The peace
that was forged between the various tribes of the
Southern Plains proved permanent, and together
they lived, hunted, raided, and fought mutual enemies until the last of the tribes were forcibly removed from the region by the U.S. Army in 1874.
MATERIAL CULTURE OF
HISTORIC SOUTHERN
PLAINS INDIANS
If European trade goods played a significant
role in the material culture of the historic Southern
Plains Indians, then it stands to reason that some of
these items should be represented in the archeological record. This section provides a brief review
of the documentary evidence that provides insights
into the kinds of materials that were traded to the
Southern Plains tribes. Table 1 provides a list of
trade items discussed by various scholars. Most of
the information contained in Table 1 was derived
from the work of Levine and Freeman (1982), who
conducted extensive research into the New Mexican-Plains Indian trade; more recent sources are
also included.
A review of the items in Table 1 shows that the
an-ay of goods traded was quite extensive. The items
range from metal tools used for food preparation
(knives, pots, utensils), and hide processing and
leather working (awls, scissors, fleshers), to weapons and firearms (metal projectile points, guns, ammunition, gunflints, musket balls). Other items were

for personal adornment (rings, bracelets, conchas,
glass beads), horse tack and equipment (bridles,
bits, saddles), and fire making (strike-a-lights).
Kenner (1969:37) states that by the mid- l 700s, the
quantity and variety of goods that the New Mexican traders could offer to the Comanches was continually increasing. It appears that by the early-19th
century, European trade items were quickly replacing the traditional stone, bone, and clay tools and
containers of the Southern Plains Indians.
While many of the trade items were in the form
of foodstuffs, cloth, robes, and textiles that would
probably not be preserved in an archeological site,
the metal and glass items should be preserved in
historic Southern Plains Indian sites. Several of the
references in Table 1 are, in fact, archeological
reports that discuss metal and glass trade items
encountered during investigations of a particular
site. These reports form the basis of the following
section, which examines the nature and distribution
of historic Indian sites in the Texas portion of the
Southern Plains.

THE STUDY SAMPLE
The Texas Historic Sites Atlas, which is maintained by the Texas Historical Commission, was
consulted to determine the number, type, and distribution of documented historic Indian sites in the
Texas portion of the Southern Plains. Archeological site records from 72 counties in the Panhandle,
South Plains, and Lower Plains were examined. It
was found, however, that some of the records within
the Atlas database are incomplete. Therefore, the
site records at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) were also utilized. A search
revealed that more than 6,300 archeological sites
have been recorded for the 72 counties within the
study sample. However, since some of the site
records did not include information on types of
artifacts found at the site, only those that contained
this information were included in the study. This
resulted in a study sample of 5,800 site records
(Table 2). Of these, only 61, or 1.05 percent, were
determined to be historic Indian sites or sites that
contained a historic Indian component.
If the artifacts recovered or observed at the site
by the recorder included items such as metal projectile points, glass beads, copper or brass bracelets, or other European trade items, the site was

considered to be historic Indian or to have an historic Indian component. Some site forms mentioned
the occurrence of tepee rings, but unless the forms
noted the presence of one or more artifacts indicating an occupation by a historic Indian group, the
sites were not included in the study sample. A few
rock-art sites with depictions of clearly historic subjects, such as longhorn cattle, horses, guns, or people
in European-style dress, were included even though
no artifacts were noted in the site records.
Only 26 of the 72 counties in the study sample
had one or more recorded historic Indian sites. The
types of historic Indian sites within these counties
are presented in Table 3. On the basis of the data
recorded on the site forms, the 61 historic Indian
sites were separated into three types: camps/villages, burials, and rock-art sites.

encampments that were attacked by Colonel Ranald
S. Mackenzie and the Fourth Cavalry on September
28, 1874. Though the military records leave little
doubt that 41AM1 is the location of the battle
(Wallace 1968:123-124), no systematic archeological investigations have been conducted to confirm
the locations of the Indian villages or the battle site.
The investigations that have taken place at the
historic Indian camp/village sites have largely been
confined to surface collecting where one or more
historic Indian items were recovered. Eight of the
sites, however, have been subjected to more intense
investigations by professional archeologists. In order to examine the characteristics of the components at these sites, they are briefly reviewed below. The sites are discussed in the order of their
approximate chronological occurrence.

Camps and Villages

The Headstream Site (41KT51)

Most of the historic Indian sites (n=38, or 62.3
percent) in the study sample were classified as open
camps or villages. The site records for 30 of the
camp/village sites list the occurrence of metal projectile points. Four of these site records also mention the presence of glass trade beads. Four other
site records list glass trade beads as the only diagnostic artifact used for classifying the site as historic Indian, though one of these also mentions
unspecified "historic metal artifacts."
Two sites in the camp/village category are problematic because neither appears to have been investigated sufficiently to confirm occupations by historic Indians. The first is site 41 ST3 in Sterling
County. The site record indicates that it is a known
Kiowa camp, but the only artifacts mentioned are
cores, bifaces, and lithic debris. The other site,
41AM1, in Armstrong County, is the reported location of Comanche, Kiowa, and Southern Cheyenne

The Headstream site was recorded and investigated during the Lake Alan Henry Reservoir Project
(Boyd et al. 1993). The site is situated on an alluvial terrace on the east side of Grape Creek in Kent
County. During the investigations at the site, 89 m2
of the site area was hand excavated and seven backhoe trenches were excavated. The excavations revealed five cultural features including a midden, a
rock-lined hearth, two small, unlined basin hearths,
and a baking pit. Four radiocarbon and three
archeomagnetic dates indicate that the site was occupied during the mid- l 600s.
The investigations recovered 4,499 artifacts,
the majority of which are chipped stone, though
ceramics account for nearly 20 percent of the aiiifacts. The diagnostic chipped-stone artifacts include
21 arrow points of Fresno and Lott types, as well as
untyped triangular and expanding-stem specimens.
The ceramics included a variety of wares including

rock-art sites with clearly historic depictions.

Tewa Polychrome, red-slipped sherds of the Tewa
tradition, unslipped and slipped redware sherds of
Puebloan origin, and Pecos Glaze V polychrome. A
number of utility wares could not be identified, but
most of them are similar to Puebloan-made plain
and striated wares such as Pecos Faint Striated. The
only artifacts from the site indicative of European

contact are two faceted cobalt-blue glass beads.
Their source of manufacture was not determined.
Boyd ( 1997: 170) interprets the Headstream site
to be a multifunctional base camp that was occupied repeatedly over a period of time. He considers
the site to be affiliated with the Garza complex (ca.
A.D. 1400 to 1700).

The Longhorn Site (41KT53)
The Longhorn site is on an alluvial terrace of
Grape Creek only 800 m upstream from the Headstream site. Like the Headstream site, the Longhorn
site was recorded and investigated in conjunction
with the Lake Alan Henry Reservoir Project (Boyd
et al. 1993). The archeological investigations at the
site consisted of the hand excavation of 340 m2,
with the majority of the units located in four large
blocks. In addition, 14 backhoe trenches were excavated and a large portion of the site area was
surveyed using a proton magnetometer.
The archeological investigations identified 50
cultural features and recovered 9,029 artifacts
(Boyd 1997; Boyd et al. 1993). In addition, 18
radiocarbon dates and three archeomagnetic dates
were obtained. The most common features identified were post molds, most of which are interpreted as being associated with three separate tepee structures. Other posts may have been for outside structures such as shade arbors. One of the
tepee-associated post molds contained a Bos horn
core interpreted as representing a tie-down stake
for securing the tepee foundation (Boyd 1997: 177).
Each tepee structure also had a well-defined,

x

unlined basin hearth with ashy fill. Three other
basin hearths that are not associated with the tepee
structures were also discovered.
The artifact assemblage from the site contained
more than 6,000 lithics, 2,595 ceramics, and 11 historic artifacts. The lithic tool assemblage contained a
high frequency of unifacial tools, which are dominated by Plains-style end scrapers thought to be related to the processing of bison hides. Projectile points
and bifaces were not well represented at the site, but
the projectile point forms that were identified include Fresno, Washita and Harrell-like, and Lott.
The ceramic assemblage was varied and represented a minimum of 24 vessels and four pipes. Two
of the pipes are rectangular-bodied Pecos-style pipes,
and most of the ceramics are of Puebloan manufacture. The ceramics include Tewa Polychrome, Pecos
Glaze V Polychrome, glaze-painted wares of various
Glaze E and/or F forms, Salinas Redware, redwares
of various Glaze E and/or F forms, and a micaceous
plainware from the Taos/Picuris area.
The historic artifacts from the site include 5
majolica sherds, 4 possible gunflints, a lead ball,
and an unidentified iron fragment. In addition to
the cow horn core, a horse tooth was also recovered,

Cruse-Detecting Historic Indian Sites
providing further evidence of European-introduced
animals at the site.
The site was dated by 18 radiocarbon and 4
archeomagnetic assays associated with cultural features. According to Boyd et al. (1993:209), the
dates and the artifacts indicate that "the Longhorn
Site was occupied most intensively during the A.D.
1600s, perhaps extending into the early A.D.
1700s." The Longhorn site is interpreted as a residential base camp that was repeatedly occupied on
a periodic or seasonal basis and affiliated with the
Garza complex.

115

Other artifacts from the Block B excavations
include a Marcos dart point, a Harrell and two
Fresno arrow points, three scrapers, a biface, two
ground-stone pieces, a bone tool, three small sherds
of late Pecos-like glazeware, and three Olivella shell
beads. Faunal remains include 814 animal bones,
most of which appear to be bison. Quigg et al.
(1993:241) do not assign a cultural affiliation to the
site, but they note that the Tierra Blanca Complex
(A.D. 1300-1650) is a possibility.

The Sandstone Ledger Site (41BI34 Area II)
Site 41HF86
Site 41 HF86 is a rockshelter located at the
head of a small tributary drainage to Horse Creek
in Hansford County. It was excavated as part of
the data-recovery investigations at Palo Duro
Reservoir (Quigg et al. 1993). Thirteen 1 x 1 m
units were excavated in the shelter. The deposits
vary from 30 to 80 cm thick and contain evidence of multiple occupations, though the deposits had undergone considerable disturbance
from extensive use of the shelter in modern times.
Nonetheless, three aboriginal hearths were encountered.
Although the disturbance of the deposits prevented separation of the cultural materials into coherent assemblages, a radiocarbon sample from one
of the hearths produced a calibrated calendar age of
A.D. 1480-1658. Ten Washita and Fresno arrow
points were recovered, as were several historic artifacts, including a native-made brass arrow point
fragment and a metal finger ring. The site is interpreted as being temporarily occupied during the
late Protohistoric or early Historic Periods.
The Broken Jaw Site (41HF8 Block B)
The Broken Jaw site is located on an alluvial
terrace of Palo Duro Creek in Hansford County.
Like site 41HF86, it was excavated as part of the
data-recovery investigations at Palo Duro Reservoir (Quigg et al. 1993). The 18 m2 excavation of
Block B exposed two shallow, unlined hearth features. From one of the features an iron, nativemade arrow point was recovered. Quigg et al.
(1993:241) state that the metal arrow point probably dates to between A.D. 1750 and 1874, but they
offer no supporting evidence for this date.

The Sandstone Ledger site is located on a small
terrace on the west side of Tule Creek in western
Briscoe County. Along the southern edge of the site,
a talus slope to the southwest leads to a sandstone
face, which contains more than two dozen
petroglyphs from which the site takes its name
(Willey and Hughes 1978:254). The Sandstone Ledger site was recorded in 1970 by J arnes Malone who
conducted the initial survey prior to the construction
of Mackenzie Reservoir in Tule Canyon (Malone
1970). Malone recorded the site based on a small
hearth he observed eroding from the edge of the site.
In 1973 the site was investigated in conjunction
with the construction of Mackenzie Reservoir
(Hughes and Willey 1978). The work at the site
consisted of documenting the rock art and 41.4 m2
of hand excavations. The excavations revealed three
hearths, all of which are described as "small, shallow, unlined fire basins" (Willey and Hughes
1978:264). The dimensions of the hearths ranged
from approximately 43 cm to 52 cm in length, from
31 cm to 55 cm in width, and from 3 cm to 8 cm in
thickness. Two of the hearths, Features 1 and 2,
contained charcoal, but there is no indication that
the charcoal was submitted for chronometric dating.
Small bone fragments from Features 1 and 2 were
also noted.
Other than the bone fragments and a single
piece of shell, only 13 other artifacts were recovered
from the site and all of these were found on the
surface. These include 7 lithic specimens (1 core, 4
flake tools, 1 uniface, and 1 thin biface), and 5
metal items. Three of the metal artifacts are iron
and include a complete arrow point, a chiseled piece
identified as a flesher bit, and an unidentified piece
of cut metal. The other two metal artifacts are brass
items, one of which is a small piece of chisel-cut
metal and the other is an expended cartridge

116

identified as .45-70 caliber that was found "more
than 600 feet n01ih of the northernmost excavations"
(Willey and Hughes 1978:262).
Willey and Hughes (1978:264) interpret the
Sandstone Ledger site as most likely a single-component occupation by historic Indians. However,
they state that the petroglyphs at the site, which
consisted of 27 linear grooves, "may or may not be
associated with the occupation." The small number
of artifacts recovered suggests that the sampled area
of the site was occupied briefly.
The Sand Pit Site (41BI46 Area II)
Like the Sandstone Ledger site, the Sand Pit
site was investigated in 1973 in conjunction with
the construction of Mackenzie Reservoir. The
site had been recorded in 1970 when an eroding
hearth and lithic debitage were observed (Malone
1970). The site is situated on a south-side terrace of Tule Creek near its juncture with Cope
Creek. Previously, the surface of the site area
had been bladed to facilitate sand-quarrying operations associated with the construction of the
reservoir dam. The excavations at the site (a
total of 73.6 m 2) documented 5 unlined hearths
and recovered 2,263 artifacts (Willey et al.
1978:231-253). The hearths are described as being small, shallow, basin-shaped, and unlined,
with circular to oval plan outlines. The dimensions of the hearths range from approximately
30 cm to 40 cm in length, 27 cm to 40 cm in
width, and 3 cm to 11 cm in thickness. Fill from
the hearths was composed of light gray ash with
some charcoal flecks, and burned and unburned
bone fragments. Artifacts found in or near the
hearths included lithic flakes, metate fragments,
abraded stones, burned and unburned bones,
butchered bones, glass beads, and sheet iron.
The artifacts from the site include chipped stone
(1,454), ground stone (28), unmodified stone (22),
modified bone (11), unmodified bone (690), shell
(1), ceramic (4), glass beads (12), and metal (41). Of
note within the chipped-stone artifacts were 11 arrow points (1 Washita, l Reed-like, 1 Young-like, 6
Fresno, and 2 unidentifiable tips) and S gunflints.
Two of the gunflints appear to have been made by
the Indian occupants of the site, while the other
three are European-made and thought to be "Dutch
style and made between 1750 and 1775" (Willey et
al. 1978:251).

The ceramics from the site include one piece of
burned clay and three rim sherds. The sherds include a Rio Grande utility ware, an unidentified
black polished utility ware, and a San Lazaro Glaze
Polychrome. The Rio Grande utility sherd dates
from A.D. 1350 to 1600. The San Lazaro Glaze
Polychrome derives from Tonque Pueblo where it
was made between ca. A.D. 1450 and 1475. Willey
et al. (1978:250) indicate, however, that this sherd
was recovered "several hundred yards" northeast of
the Sand Pit site proper and is probably not associated with the Sand Pit occupation.
The 12 glass beads recovered from the site are
all white, some of which are described as being
"iridescent" while others are not (Willey et al.
1978:250). All but one of the beads measure 2 x 3
mm. The one exception measures 7 x 7 mm.
Of the 41 pieces of iron recovered, most are
small, cut pieces that appear to be discarded scraps
from the manufacturing of tinklers. The other metal
artifacts include the handle and a portion of the
blade from a knife and a long (38 cm) flesher fashioned from the rim of a wagon or buggy wheel.
The Sand Pit site is interpreted as being a
multi-component site. An early occupation (A.D.
1350-1600) is suggested by the Rio Grande utility ware, and a later eomanche occupation (A.D.
1750-1800) is indicated by the gunflints and the
relative abundance of iron. While many of the
lithic items from the site may be attributed to the
earlier occupation, Willey et al. (1978:253) believe that some of the lithics are associated with
the later occupation as well. Nevertheless, these
authors suggest, "Iron was beginning to be substituted for stone implements and glass for shell
ornaments. The people at the Sand Pit site then
were making a transition from stone-, bone- and
shell-using technology to a metal and glass one"
(1978:253). They also speculate that the small,
unlined hearths like the ones at this site and at
the Sandstone Ledger site may be representative
of historic Southern Plains Indians.
The Floydada Country Club Site (41FL1)
The Floydada Country Club site is a multicomponent site located in Blanco Canyon near the
head of the White River in Floyd County. In the
early 1960s, Jim Word, an avocational archeologist
from Floydada, excavated either 4 or 5 test units at
various locations across the site. Word (1963:40)

Cruse-Detecting Historic Indian Sites
indicates that four units were excavated, but later
reported (Word 1991:99) that five units were excavated. The units measured 5 square feet, for a total
area of either 9.2 m2 or 11.5 m2 . In 1975 the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS) held its field school
at the site where an additional 108 m2 of site area
was excavated (Word 1991).
From the excavations conducted at the site in
the 1960s, 15 artifacts were recovered that appear
to be associated with a historic Indian occupation
of the site. These include seven blue glass beads, a
piece of brass "similar to brass inlays used in decoration of rifles," a broken cartridge extractor from a
rifle believed to have been used "in the late 19th
century," three .44 caliber Henry rimfire cartridges,
one iron arrow point and an arrow point preform,
and a ceramic ocarina (Word 1963:60).
During the 1975 TAS excavations, only four
artifacts were recovered that were attributable to
historic Indians. These include a blue, round glass
bead that dates from 1820 to 1836 (Word 1991: 102);
a piece of cut metal that may be debris from manufacturing of an arrow point; an ox bow yoke pin;
and a tinkler that "contained a glass bead in the
narrow part" (Word 1991:70). The bead found in
the tinkler is apparently not the same blue glass
bead mentioned earlier, but no additional information for this "second" bead is given.
Word (1991:99) states that artifacts from the
site that are associated with the Historic Period
include "metal projectile points, steel awls, rifle
cartridge cases, and parts of rifle locks." This suggests that more than one metal arrow point was
found at the site. He further states, "several homemade flints for a flintlock rifle were also found on
the surface of the site." The steel awls, parts of rifle
locks, and gunflints are not described further. It is
assumed that these items have been found at the
site by private collectors who may have described
or shown their finds to Word.
No features have been found at the site that can
be attributed to an occupation by historic Indians.
Word (1991: 100) suggests that the historic Indian
artifacts are probably associated with a temporary
occupation of the site by Comanches.
Site 41BI544
Site 41BI544 was identified in 1999 when archeologists with the Texas Historical Commission
were documenting the Battle of Red River site.

117

This battle was a running engagement between the
U.S. Army and Southern Cheyenne and Comanche
Indians that occurred on August 30, 1874, near the
Prairie Dog Town Fork of Red River in present
Armstrong and Briscoe counties. During the survey
of the battle site, the archeologists, who were using
metal detectors to locate and record artifacts associated with the battle, found a number of metal
tools and other metal items that apparently had
been discarded by the fleeing Indian families as
they were trying to stay ahead of the advancing
U.S. Army (Cruse et al. 2000:42-46).
According to Colonel Nelson A. Miles (1874a,
1874b), who was commanding the U.S. forces during the battle, the army was advancing toward an
Indian village that was located near the mouth of
Tule Canyon. After reaching the location of the
village, the army discovered that the Indians had
burned the village and any supplies they could not
caiTy with them as they fled. The army pursued the
Indians, but when they could not catch up with
them, they returned to the location of the village
and camped there for several days.
As the archeological survey team made its way
up Tule Canyon, site 41BI544 was located (Figure
2). Based on the items recovered during the survey,
the site appears to be the location of the Indian
village referred to by Colonel Miles and the subsequent camp of the military.
An earlier archeological survey had been conducted in this portion of Tule Canyon in 1974 by
Susanna and Paul Katz (1976). Their survey, however, which was conducted without the aid of metal
detectors, failed to locate site 4 IBI544. They did
identify a number of prehistoric sites in the area.
One of these sites (41BI8 l) is immediately east of
41BI544, while another site (41BI82) is located
near the west end of 41BI544. No indications were
found that either of these sites had been occupied
by historic Indians.
The investigations at 41BI544 were designed to
locate the site, define its boundaries, and obtain a
large enough artifact sample to confidently identify
temporal occupations. The site area was traversed
using metal detectors to locate metal items. When a
metal object was located, it was excavated and identified. The artifact location was then precisely mapped
using a Trimbleni Pro XRS sub-meter accurate global
positioning system receiver. Though no excavation
units per se were excavated, some 185 shovel probes
were excavated where metal artifacts were identified.

It is noteworthy that no lithic flakes, tools, or ceramic

A total of 185 metal artifacts and one gunflint
were recovered from the site. Of these, 137 items
are attributed to the U.S. Army occupation of the
site, and they are not discussed further in this paper. Of interest to the current study are the 48 metal
items and the gunflint believed to be associated
with the Indian occupation of the site (Table 4). A
variety of items are among the recovered metal
artifacts, including six arrow points (Figure 3), an
arrow point preform, and several pieces of cut metal.
At least three of the affow points appear to have
been native-made (Figure 3 d-f). These three points,
along with the preform and the cut metal pieces,
suggest that arrow points were being manufactured
at the site. Several horse-related items were also
recovered. These include coscojos (Figure 4 a) or
jingles that would have been attached to a Mexican-style bit, and a rein chain and ring (Figure 4 d
and b) that were parts of a bridle. The tinklers were
probably attached to clothing with a leather tassel
or thong. Other items recovered include awls, two
small buckles, buttons, and part of a spoon.

Several firearm-related artifacts were also
recovered. These include bullets, cartridges, and
a gunflint. The bullets include two .44 caliber
Winchesters, two .50 caliber Sharps, and a native-made .57 caliber round ball fashioned from
copper. Eleven expended .44 caliber Winchester
cartridges were also recovered. The bullets and
cartridges are typical of the kinds of firearms the
Indians were using in 1874 (Cruse et al. 2000,
2001). The single gunflint recovered was found
on the surface. It appears to be a European-made
gunflint of dark gray chert. The gunflint suggests that some Indians may still have been using flintlock rifles.
The limited investigations conducted at
41BI544 suggest that this site was the location
of the Indian village that the U.S. Army was
trying to capture at the Battle of Red River in
187 4. The variety of Indian-related artifacts indicates that a diverse range of activities was conducted at the site including arrow point manufacturing, leather or hide working, horse-related
activities, and the production of munitions for
firearms.

DISCUSSION
From the foregoing summaries of the tested or
excavated historic Indian sites in the study sample
it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding settlement and artifact content, though one general trend seems apparent: the reliance on European
metal and glass trade goods increases through time.
The archeological data generally parallels the historical documents with regard to the use and incorporation of European goods into the material culture of the Southern Plains Indians. Sites such as
Headstream and Longhorn provide clear evidence
that European goods were being incorporated into
the Southern Plains material culture by the mid- to
late-1600s. By the mid-1800s, it appears that the
reliance on Euro-American goods by historic Indians had increased significantly, as evidenced by the
varied artifact assemblages at sites such as Floydada
Country Club and 41BI544.
The archeological data suggests that early historic Southern Plains Indians were using lithic and
ceramic technologies, but these were gradually
abandoned as metal and glass items became

119

increasingly available. Of particular note is the
presence of lithic arrow points at six of the investigated historic Indian sites. It may be that arrow
point types such as Fresno, Garza, Harrell, and
Washita continued to be used into the Historic Period on the Southern Plains. How long lithic arrow
points continued to be used by historic Indians after
they acquired firearms and metal for making arrow
points is unknown. Archeologists should not assume, therefore, that all sites that yield late arrow
point types are necessarily Late Prehistoric in age,
especially if those sites have not also produced
Late Prehistoric ceramic types or chronometric dates
that would support a Late Prehistoric temporal
placement. It may be that these sites are in fact
historic Indian sites, and they should be searched
with metal detectors in an effort to locate metal
artifacts that would prove their historic affiliation.
From the historic Indian sites that have been
investigated, it appears that evidence of tepees may
or may not be found and, therefore, we cannot
assume that all historic Indian campsites will contain evidence of tepees. One feature type that seems
to be common on historic Indian sites is the small,
shallow, unlined, basin hearth. This feature type
has been found at five of the eight investigated
sites. Though similar features have also been recorded at prehistoric sites, several of the small basin hearths associated with the historic Indian sites
discussed above were hearths inside tepees.

Burials
After camps and villages, burials are the next
most common historic Indian site type (n=13, or
21.3 percent) in the study sample. Of the burials in
the sample, only the Morgan Jones (41CB53) and
Canyon Creek (410Cl3) burials have been investigated and reported by professional archeologists
(Parsons 1967; Shafer et al. 1994). The other recorded burials were all found by avocationals and,
unfortunately, they had been disturbed in varying
degrees. Nonetheless, several of those burials were
subsequently studied by professionals and the results of those studies published (Newcomb 1955;
Ray and Jelks 1964; Suhm 1962; Word and Fox
1975).
Of the 13 burials, six were located inside small
rockshelters, four were recorded as crevice burials,
two were interments at open camps, and one was
not identified as to the type of interment. The site

records for 12 of the burials mention the presence of European trade goods. The site record
for site 41HF124 states that this site is probably
a historic Indian crevice burial, but when the site
was mitigated in 1990 prior to the construction
of the Palo Duro Reservoir, no evidence of a
burial was found nor were any artifacts recovered (Quigg et al. 1993:353). The excavators did
find evidence, however, that the site had been
vandalized at an earlier date.
The most common artifacts recorded in association with the historic Indian burials are glass
beads (Table 5). Eleven of the site records list
beads associated with the burial. The Cogdell
burial (41FL45) in Floyd County contained approximately 150,000 beads (Word and Fox 1975).
The next most common items mentioned are
horse gear and tack of various sorts including
bits, buckles, and pieces of native-made saddles.
Other artifacts commonly mentioned are metal
bracelets, brass bells, buttons, tinklers, conchas
of copper, brass, and silver, mirrors, guns, and
metal tools of various kinds including axes, hoes,
and knives. One of the burials, the White site
burial (41 YKl), was even associated with a metal
trumpet (Suhm 1962).

Rock-art sites make up the last
type of historic Indian site in the
g
study sample. Records for only ten
rock-art locations that contain design elements or objects attributable to historic Indians (Figure 5)
were found in the study sample.
However, Boyd (1997:Table 29)
lists nine additional rock-art sites
in the region that contain historic
motifs; these sites have not been
officially recorded at TARL. Six of the recorded
sites (41GR51, 41GR52, 41GR57, 41GR282,
41GR414, and 41KT164) are petroglyph sites. Two
of the other recorded rock-art sites, 41GR344 and
41 OL4, contain both petroglyph and pictograph representations, while sites 41HF2 and 41SC3 appear
to be pictograph rock-art locations.

Figure 5. Examples of historic Indian rock-art motifs (from Boyd 1997:Figures 35 and 36, drawings not to scale): a,
horse from 41KT164; b, longhorn from 41GR344; c, horse and rider from 41GR51; d, horse with decorated halter and
rider from 41 GR282; e, oxen-pulled wagon from 41 GR5 l; f, rifles and other weapons from 41 GR52.

A number of the rock-art sites contain design
elements that reflect the use of and dependence on
European trade goods. At the Verbena site
(41GR52), for example, a petroglyph panel contains a group of 38 lines with small, appended triangles extending from their bases (Figure 5 f). Parsons (1987:269) presents a convincing argument
that these represent flintlock rifles. Similar design
elements have been identified at the Mujares Creek
site in Oldham County.
At the Ward Petroglyph site (41GR282), one
of the design motifs depicts a rider on a horse with
a highly decorated bridle (Figure 5 d). This motif is
a good depiction of the Mexican-style bridles of the
18th and 19th centuries (Keyser and Mitchell
2001 :202). On the Mexican-style bridles, hanging
under the lower lip of the horse, a metal plate or bar
was attached to the bridle bit from which a number
of jinglers or coscojos were attached to the head
strap, cheek bands, and bit (Di Peso 1953:193).
Cruse et al. (2000:42-44) describe a headstall plate
and several coscojos that were recovered at the
Battle of Red River site.
According to Boyd (1992:74), the historic Indian rock-art of the Southern Plains appears to be
of a biographic, or storytelling, nature similar to

that defined for the Northwestern Plains (Connor
and Connor 1971; Keyser 1987). For additional
information on historic Indian rock-art sites in the
Texas portion of the Southern Plains, see Boyd et
al. (1990), Jackson (1938), Kirkland (1942),
Kirkland and Newcomb (1967), Parsons (1987),
and Upshaw (1972).
Historic Indian Site Distribution
The distribution of the recorded historic Indian sites as shown in Figure 6 reveals that most
of the sites occur within the Caprock Canyonlands
region as defined by Boyd (1997:7-9). The Caprock Canyonlands region is associated with the
Caprock Escarpment, which separates the eastern
edge of the Llano Estacada from the western edge
of the Lower Plains. Of the 61 recorded historic
Indian sites, 37 occur within this region. The higher
density of sites within the Caprock Canyonlands
is likely due to environmental or ecological factors. As Boyd (1997:37-53) has demonstrated, the
resource-rich Caprock Canyonlands environmental zone was more intensively utilized by Native
American peoples during the late Holocene than
were the adjacent regions. The abundance of

Cruse-Detecting Historic Indian Sites

that the Caprock Canyonlands region was favored
by historic Indian groups.
The fact remains that only 61 historic Indian
sites have been recorded in the 72-county study
sample. Of significance are the surprisingly high
percentages of recorded burial and rock-art sites in
the study sample. Combined, these two site types
account for nearly 38 percent of the recorded historic Indian sites in the study sample. This suggest
that historic Indian burials, which are often located
in relatively easily found rockshelters, and rock-art
sites that are generally easily seen, are being found
and recorded while many habitation sites are not
being identified. The question of why the historic
Indian habitation sites are not being identified is
examined in the following section.

Why Historic Indian Sites Are Not Being
Identified by Archeologists

Figure 6. Distribution of historic Indian sites in relation to
the natural regions within the study area.

springs and other natural resources made the
region particularly attractive. In addition, the
canyonlands would have offered abundant shelter
and protection from the elements during the coldest
winter months. The many rockshelters, overhangs,
and crevices of the canyonlands offered locations
that were often utilized by historic Indians to bury
their dead, while the many sandstone cliffs and
exposures found throughout the region provided
ideal surfaces for rock-art.
This is not to suggest that the adjacent Llano
Estacado and Lower Plains regions were not utilized
by historic Indians. The grasslands of the Llano and
Lower Plains were the favored habitats of the bison.
Nevertheless, the scarcity of wood and other subsistence resources on the Llano Estacado probably dictated that occupation of this region was ephemeral
and most likely took the form of temporary seasonal
camps associated with hunting. It is possible, however, that in times of sufficient rainfall the historic
Indian bison hunters could have had longer-term
habitations near the many pluvial lakes that dot the
Llano Estacado. It seems apparent, though, based on
the distribution of the recorded historic Indian sites,

Of the 5,800 recorded sites in the study sample,
most were recorded by professional archeologists
under the auspices of state and federal cultural resource laws. It is somewhat surprising that of the
61 historic Indian sites that have been recorded in
the study sample of 72 counties, only 29 were recorded by professional archeologists, while the remaining 32 sites were recorded by avocationals. A
closer look at the site records for the 29 sites recorded by professional archeologists suggests that
at least 11 of these were found by private citizens
or avocationals who then reported the sites to professionals. It seems that most sites overall are identified and recorded by professional archeologists,
but the majority of historic Indian sites are identified by avocationals. Why are professionals not
identifying historic Indian sites?
As mentioned, I believe that the survey
techniques now utilized by archeologists are not
adequate to identify most historic Indian sites.
Currently, site identification techniques are
designed to locate lithic and ceramic artifacts, but
as Boyd (1997:62) points out, the replacement of
chipped lithic arrow points and beveled knives
with metal arrow points and knives may have
resulted in a significant reduction in the manufacture and archeological occurrence of both of
these lithic tool categories. The presence of
firearms may have further decreased the reliance
on native technology. The availability of metal
pots and pans, axes, wedges, and hammers may

Protohistoric artifact assemblages.
If

the
material culture of the historic Indians of the Southern Plains was composed largely of
metal
the time has come for archeologists to use metal detectors when surveying areas where historic Indians are known to have been.
Information gleaned from the historic Indian
site records and from the avocationals who have
identified several of the historic Indian sites (Ben
communication 2002; Alvin Lynn,
communication 2002) indicates that at least
eight of the historic Indian camp/village sites in the
were identified by avocationals using
metal detectors. Other historic Indian sites recorded
avocationals may have also been located with the

CONCLUSIONS
Historic Indian sites on the Southern Plains have
been
overlooked by professional

archeologists whose survey strategies are designed
to locate sites containing primarily lithic and ceramic
artifacts. The significance of metal aitifacts obtained
through trade with Europeans should not be
underestimated when considering the archeology of
the historic Southern Plains tribes. Most of our
knowledge of these peoples has come from early
ethnohistorical documents, which indicate that
historic Southern Plains Indians relied on European
trade goods to some extent, particularly metal items,
and this reliance increased through time. This seems
to be borne out particularly by the items that have
been found in association with historic Indian burials,
and, to a lesser extent, by the few investigations of
historic Indian campsites. Given the apparent
importance of metal items, archeologists must begin
to incorporate the use of metal detectors into their
survey strategies. A vocationals and relic collectors
are successfully locating historic Indian campsites by
using metal detectors, and professional archeologists
must do the same if this important part of the
archeological record is to be identified and studied.
Obviously, it is not practical or efficient for
archeologists to begin lugging around metal detectors along with their shovels and screens when they
are conducting general surveys of an area. Rather,
the point of this paper is to attempt to make professional archeologists become more aware of the presence of historic Indian sites and to point out the
need for developing ways to better identify and
assess those sites.
Professional archeologists must begin to recognize the potential "traits" for Historic Period Indian
sites. For example, as mentioned earlier we should
not assume that just because a site yields late style
airnw points that the site is necessarily Late Prehistoric in age if the site has not also produced Late
Prehistoric ceramics or supporting chronometric
dates. The use of lithics for producing arrow points
may have continued into the Historic Period until
they were eventually replaced by metal points. These
types of sites should be examined with metal detectors to search for historic period metal artifacts.
Hays (1989:257) has emphasized that the greatest potential for study of the archeological remains
of historic Indians on the Southern Plains is the
survey and testing of habitation sites and more
comprehensive analysis of the artifacts from those
sites. Wallace and Hoebel (1952:14) list five criteria that Plains Indians considered when choosing a
campsite, namely the availability of food, forage

Cruse-Detecting Historic Indian Sites
for horse herds, shelter, safety, and convenience.
The archeologist searching for historic Southern
Plains Indian sites should also keep in mind that
the available documentary accounts indicate that a
historic Plains Indian camp may be as small as a
single tepee, or a village that may have extended
for several miles.
At the few historic Indian sites that have been
professionally investigated within the study sample,
only the Longhorn site (41KT53) has produced
archeological evidence (in the form of post molds)
of tepees. Therefore, we should not assume that
every historic Indian campsite will contain evidence of tepees. However, sites with such features
probably hold the highest likelihood of being historic Indian, and they should be carefully surveyed
with metal detectors.
This study used historic Indian sites from the
Texas portion of the Southern Plains as the study
sample, but the use of metal detectors would likely
prove beneficial in locating historic Indian sites in
other regions as well. For example, Prikryl
(2001 :68-69) points out that there have been no
pre-reservation Tonkawa sites recorded in Texas
even though the Tonkawas occupied a large area of
north-central Texas between the Red River and San
Antonio from about 1700 until the late 1800s.
Prikryl (2001 :69) suggests that one reason Tonkawa
sites have not been identified is that the number of
European trade goods the Tonkawas had was probably small compared with that of their Wichita and
Caddo neighbors, and as a result it will probably be
difficult to distinguish historic Tonkawa sites from
pre-contact era sites. Prikryl may be correct, but I
would maintain that the Tonkawas were not isolationists and that they did acquire European trade
goods, as did virtually all historic Indian groups.
These trade items should be found in historic
Tonkawa sites, and these sites can probably be located if archeologists search for metal artifacts rather
than focusing only on lithic and ceramic artifacts.
Until sufficient numbers of historic Indian habitation sites can be identified and investigated by
professional archeologists, basic research questions
concerning settlement, subsistence, and warfare will
remain unanswered. Additionally, finding substantive archeological evidence of historic Indians is
critical for understanding the complex social interactions between the various tribes and how the tribes
adapted to the tremendous changes brought on by
European contact.

125

The incorporation of metal detectors by
professional archeologists into their survey
strategies would not only aid in recognizing historic
Indian sites, but would also improve assessments
of historic Indian components. One can only wonder
how many of the recorded sites within the study
sample are incorrectly classified as "low-density
prehistoric lithic scatters" that warrant "no further
work." Perhaps most of the low-density lithic
scatters within the study sample are nothing more
than lightly used prehistoric sites, but many of them
may be historic Indian sites where metal items had
replaced lithics. If these sites were resurveyed using
metal detectors, the result might be a more correct
assessment of their temporal affiliation and
occupational history.
Until recently, it seems that many archeologists have viewed metal detectors as tools to be
used only by "treasure hunters." We should keep
in mind, though, that treasure hunters also use
shovels and screens just like archeologists, but
that does not make them archeologists. As Connor
and Scott (1998) point out, metal detectors are
effective and inexpensive remote-sensing tools
with real value to archeologists working at sites
where metal artifacts are likely to be part of the
site assemblage. The time has arrived for archeologists to use whatever resources are available to
identify all the significant sites within their survey
areas and to dispense with their bias toward lithic
and ceramic sites. Contact and Historic Period
Indian sites potentially contain a wealth of information that is largely being overlooked.

The Denbigh Project 2002
Excavation of a Civil War Blockade Runner
J. Barto Arnold III, Andrew W. Hall, and Thomas J. Oertling

ABSTRACT
The British coastal paddle steamer Denbigh ran the Union blockade between Havana and Mobile and then
between Havana and Galveston. The ship was one of the most successful blockade runners of the Civil War until,
in late May 1865 while on an inbound run, she ran aground in shallow water at the entrance of Galveston Bay.
Unable to free herself, the Denbigh was destroyed when daylight revealed her predicament to the blockading
Union fleet. The Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M University located the site in December 1997
and investigated the wreck each summer from 1998 through 2002. The present report summarizes the excavation
of the site with emphasis on the final and most recent field season.

INTRODUCTION
The Denbigh was an iron-hulled paddle steamer
182 ft. (55.5 m) long. As a Liverpool coastal passenger-ship built by Laird's in 1860, she was noted
for her speed. As a blockade-runner in the Gulf of
Mexico in 1863-1865, she was one of the most
successful and famous of the Civil War. The
Denbigh ran aground at the entrance of Galveston
Bay (Figure 1) in late May 1865 and then was
shelled and burned by the Union blockading fleet.
The goals of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology's
(INA) Denbigh Project are research, education, and
public outreach. Archaeological research at the
Denbigh site is particularly important because, although there is historical evidence for her operations, the historic record preserves almost nothing
of her construction details. For example, plans of
the ship have not survived, although descriptive
information on the dimensions, cargo capacity, operational history, and other aspects of the vessel
exist (Table 1).
The Institute of Nau ti cal Archaeology at Texas
A&M University located the Denbigh shipwreck
site (41GV143) in December 1997 and has
continued to investigate the wreck during the
following summer field seasons between 1998 and
2002. The 2002 work at the Denbigh shipwreck
was the project's fifth field season. Prior work
included predisturbance mapping during the 1998

field season, test excavations in 1999, and two
summers of full-scale excavation during the 2000
and 2001 seasons (Arnold 1987, 2001a, 2001b,
2001c; Arnold et al. 1997, 1999a, 1997b, 2000;
Hall 2002; Hall et al. 2002; S.B. Oertling 2002; T.J.
Oertling 2002; G. Powell 2002; Watson 2001).
The 1998 season pre-excavation mapping of
the Denbigh included recording the remains of the
vessel's machinery that protruded above the muddy,
6 foot deep (ca. 2 m) floor of the bay to a height
usually just below the water surface. The site had
been located during an INA reconnaissance survey
using position data from a late 19th century Corps
of Engineers map that yielded the distance and bearing from the Bolivar Light House. In addition to
mapping exposed remains, this phase included remote sensing surveys using magnetometer, sidescan sonar, sub-bottom sonar, and fathometer. The
exposed remains consisted of portions of the
Denbigh's boiler, paddle wheels, and the very upper parts of the twin steam engines. The deck level
was just below the muddy sand bottom.
The 1999 season test excavations consisted of
three units: one centrally located in the engine room,
one in the forward area thought to be a cargo hold,
and one toward the stern in an area thought to lie
beneath the crew quarters. The engine room revealed
that the major components of the Denbigh' s
machinery were intact. This was welcome but
somewhat unexpected since engines and other

machinery were often salvaged. The
finding was particularly important
because the ship's technology was a
major aspect of interest for further
investigation. The Denbigh' s type
of ship had served as a test bed for
constantly evolving innovations in
marine engineering for much of the
nineteenth century. The test excavation unit in the forward area found
the port side of the ship had broken
and collapsed outward. The aft test
excavation unit found the stern area
of the hull intact. Beneath about 10
feet (ca. 1.5 m) of overburden, a few
artifacts were found hinting at the
presence of cargo and crew possessions. Only the first couple of feet
(ca. 60 cm) above the hull's bottom
yielded relatively undisturbed

Arnold, Hall and Oertling archeological deposits, a pattern that seems to be the
usual at this site.
Three summers of full-scale excavation during
the 2000, 2001, and 2002 field seasons allowed the
recording of hull construction, the complex
paddlewheel and drive train, and the port engine
together with the condenser, air pump, hot well,
and boiler. Another excavation unit in the stern half
of the hull helped confirm the location of the crew
quarters, but excavations were mainly concentrated
in the engine room and just outboard of the engine
room. Small artifacts were generally scarce, but
one remote corner of the engine room contained a
storage area for engineering department tools and a
private stash of liquor. Some of the bottles were
sealed with intact contents; however, the contents
have yet to be analyzed and identified.
The present report presents the latest progress
and results. Fieldwork in 2002 took place from
June 1 to July 31 with headquarters at the campus
of Texas A&M-Galveston (TAMUG) as was the
case during the prior seasons. Educational aspects
are important goals of the Denbigh Project, but
research is the primary emphasis. This article discusses the 2002 research progress and is presented
in two sub-sections, one on historical research and
one on the excavation that includes a discussion of
a few artifacts recovered during the excavations.
The last section describes educational and public
outreach activities. Historic shipwrecks with their
instant appeal are ideal for building public understanding and appreciation of history, cultural heritage, and archeology.
The Denbigh Project benefited extensively this
year from our correspondence with John Riley of
Australia. Riley is an engineer and avocational archeologist who studies wrecks of the same period and
general type as the Denbigh. Riley led us to Burgh's
book on marine engineering with its plans of a Laird's
boiler very like the Denbigh's (Burgh 1867).
There were other important Civil War shipwreck projects in 2002 the received widespread
publicity: the gun tmTet of the USS Monitor was
brought to the surface, representing a successful
conclusion to several years of work (Anonymous
2002; Broadwater 2002); the lab work on the CSS
Hunley submarine continued (Neyland 2002; C.
Powell 2002); and the blockade-runner Pevensey
received attention (Smith 2003). Scholarly interest
in the Civil War continues to grow and public interest remains unflagging.

The Denbigh Project

It is interesting, also, to note a few new and
current books both scholarly and popular that bear
specifically on the Civil War and its last days or on
the specific situation in Texas. In the popular category, there is a novel of the Civil War period
entitled Galveston (Nagle 2002). For understanding the social and cultural setting of the mid-19th
century there is American Scoundrel: the Life of the
Notorious Civil War General Dan Sickles (Keneally
2002). In the scholarly category there is Look Away!
A History of the Confederate States of America
(Davis 2002) in which the author presents a political history of the Confederacy. The chapter on the
lack-of-civil-order problem caused by the manpower
drain into the army was eye opening. It was a very
grave problem not just at the end of the war as
defeat loomed, but from much earlier in the war
than one might have thought.
Davis has another important chapter about the
intrusion of the central Confederate government
into the business of the states and private individuals. The discussion in the chapter entitled "Cotton
Communism, Whiskey Welfare, and Salt Socialism" is fascinating. It is a great irony that in the
face of military necessity (losing the war over several years), the Confederate government violated
the most dearly held of liberties in more egregious
ways than ever had the old Union. The philosophical and political principals upon which secession
was fomented were trampled although not without
acrimony with State governors.

RESEARCH
Recent Advances in Historical ResearchYellow Fever and Blockade Running
The following section on Galveston's 1864
epidemic of yellow fever presents an important
new historical understanding and linkage resulting directly from Denbigh research. A reconsideration of events in Galveston during the late summer and fall of 1864 suggests a likely linkage
between the first steam blockade runners arriving
at Galveston after the Battle of Mobile Bay in
August 1864 and the outbreak of a yellow fever
epidemic the following month. During the first
three years of the war, steam blockade-runners
arrived at Galveston only on rare occasions; the
Texas coastal city was too far removed from the

main theaters of war to be of much use. After the
Union admiral Farragut closed the entrance to
Mobile Bay, however, Galveston was the only
seaport of any significance left in Confederate
hands on the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, beginning in late August there was a sudden upsurge in
blockade-running activity at Galveston that continued through the end of the war ten months later.
Although an effective vaccine can now prevent yellow fever, in the nineteenth century it was
a recurring and serious problem in the southern
United States and the Caribbean. Yellow fever is a
mosquito-borne viral disease varying widely in
severity, exhibiting everything from flu-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever. A
large proportion of those infected died. At the
time of the American Civil War, the variability of
the symptoms made the disease difficult to distinguish from other illnesses, and even today a positive diagnosis is only possible through laboratory
testing (WHO 2001).
The threat of yellow fever was taken very seriously in Galveston, and on August 3 the Confederate commander in Texas, General Magruder, ordered a strict 30-day quarantine for all vessels arriving from Mexico, the Caribbean and other areas
where the fever was endemic. It seems likely that
Magruder's order met with sharp opposition from
merchants and others that had an interest in blockade running, because the following day he revised
his order to require quarantine only for ships arriving from ports known to be infected with fever, and
then only for eight days isolation (Hayes 1974).
These watered-down precautions would prove to
be woefully inadequate.
The first steam blockade-runners arriving at
Galveston after the fall of Mobile were the
Susanna, arriving about August 24, and the
Denbigh, which arrived on August 25. No other
steam blockade-runner is known to have arrived
at Galveston for two weeks following the
Denbigh's arrival (Wise 1988). In the days following the Susanna's and the Denbigh's arrival,
several cases believed to be yellow fever appeared among civilians and soldiers stationed in
the town. On September 14, the first deaths positively attributed to the disease occurred. That
same day the military command sent out a call
for nurses to care for those afflicted, and two
days later the city was quarantined (unsuccessfully) to prevent the spread of the disease inland.

Over the next two months, at least 259 deaths
in Galveston were attributed to the disease. This
figure represented nearly ten percent of the town's
military and civilian population at the time. The
majority of the dead were civilians, and over a
quarter were children ten years and under. The
heaviest toll occurred in September, but deaths
were recorded as late as November 20. A heavy
frost on the evening of November 22 dissipated
the fever and the quarantine was lifted soon thereafter (Hayes 1974).
There was debate at the time about the origin
of this particular outbreak of fever. The etiology of
the disease, and the role mosquitoes played in transmitting it, would remain unconfirmed for two generations. Some in Galveston argued adamantly that
the disease must have come by way of a blockaderunning schooner that had sailed from Vera Cruz,
Mexico, while others insisted that it sprang from
"local causes in the city" (Hayes 1974).
The present authors believe the case to be somewhat unlikely for the schooner from Vera Cruz
being the source of the yellow fever outbreak. The
length of the voyage from Vera Cruz, typically a
week or longer, would probably be enough time for
symptoms to begin appearing among the crew and
to draw the attention of authorities inspecting the
vessel upon arrival. A steamer from Havana, on the
other hand, would normally be able to make the run
into Galveston in three or four days, making it
much easier for infected seamen to pass undetected. It is also possible that the disease arrived at
Galveston not in an infected sailor (who was subsequently bitten by a local mosquito), but in an insect
brought along from the vessel's point of origin. In
that scenario, too, a steamer making a quick passage seems a more likely means of transmission
than a relatively slow sailing vessel.
The normal course of the disease suggests its
first victims in Galveston were infected very shortly
after the arrival of the Susanna and the Denbigh in
late August. There were two interments of victims
on September 14--they same day they died-and
three more the following day. The disease has a
normal incubation period of three to six days, during which time there are no outward symptoms of
the illness. After this incubation period, most victims enter what is now termed the "acute phase" of
the disease, during which they experience fever,
headache, muscle pain, nausea, and vomiting. These
symptoms usually subside after three or four days

Arnold, Hall and Oertling and the patients recover. In some cases, however,
within 24 hours the disease enters its "toxic phase,"
and the patient develops jaundice (from which appearance yellow fever gets its name) and complains
of abdominal pain with vomiting. Patients bleed
from the mouth, nose, eyes, and stomach. Kidney
function drops off and sometimes fails altogether,
resulting in a rapid rise in the levels of toxins in the
body. About half the patients who enter the toxic
phase of the disease die within 10 to 14 days, while
the rest usually recover gradually (WHO 2001).
If one takes this as the course of the disease
in those patients who died on September 14 and
15, and the disease had its normal incubation
period of three to six days, they most likely were
infected during the last week of August, immediately after the arrival of the two steamers from
Havana. While the connection between the arrival of the Susanna and the Denbigh in late
August and the appearance of yellow fever in
Galveston soon after is speculative, the coincidence of these events is striking. Further research
on both the prevalence of the disease in Vera
Cruz and Havana, as well as on the arrival of
other vessels at Galveston during that period, is
currently underway and may point to other causes
of the outbreak. The authors believe, however,
that ultimately they will be able to establish a
likely source for the epidemic that swept
Galveston during that final autumn of war.

EXCAVATION
Unit 3-engine Room Forward
Part, Near Boiler
Excavation Unit 3 consists of the port half of
the engine room including the boiler. In 2002, we
finished the planned work in Unit 3, begun in earlier seasons, digging to the bottom of the ship's
interior as far down as possible. In a few small
places digging penetrated to the engine room deck.
Fallen wreckage obstructed the digging, although
the crew moved some of this debris.
The 2002 excavation cleared the area between
the engine frames beneath the paddle shaft to the
aft, forward to the face of the boiler. In addition the
crew excavated nearly the full length of the boiler's
side along the ship's port side. Important data
recorded included primarily the features of the

boiler's working face (the aft face where the stokers
shoveled in the coal and the engineers controlled
the boiler's functions).
Near the bottom of the muddy sand filling the
hull was a prominent feature of stratigraphy we
called the crunchy layer. The layer was a foot or
two above the bottom of the hull and hard enough
to be difficult to break through with hand tools.
This season's work revealed a coal bunker in the
area between the boiler and the port side of the
ship. The bunker extended aft of the working boiler
face for several feet. On its inboard side there was a
thin iron bulkhead to contain the coal. The fire set
by the Union boarding party had clearly melted this
lightweight bulkhead. This led to speculation that
the thin crunchy layer is in fact a melt layer resulting from the fire.
Unit 5-port Side Sponson and Paddlewheel
Excavation Unit 5 contained the port paddlewheel and sponson. The sponson was the structure outboard of the hull proper that supported
and housed the paddlewheel. Features recorded
in 2002 include the paddlewheel bearing attached
to the hull-side outboard (between the ship's side
and the paddlewheel hub), the structural members of the sponson, details of the float mounting brackets, and the hub of the feathering mechanism. The feathering paddlewheel was an advanced feature of the Denbigh that greatly increased speed and efficiency. It operated to move
the paddle blades (floats) keeping them nearly
vertical to the water surface.
Using a hack saw, the crew cut the iron rods
leading from the feathering hub to the pivoting
brackets of the floats. Then, with lift bags, we
moved the hub away from the ship and recovered it
using a small spud barge and crane. Deconcreting
revealed fascinating construction details including
a hollow-cast axel that served as a reservoir for
lubrication (Figures 2-6). There was collision damage to the iron sponson supports and evidence of ad
hock repair. During the Denbigh' s excavation, the
project recovered two important mechanical parts
for detailed study and for later exhibit: in 2001, the
nearly 8-ft.-long (c. 2.5 m) connecting rod of the
port engine and in 2002, the feathering hub. The
impressively large connecting rod gives a nice impression of the engine's scale and has already been
conserved and placed in a Denbigh exhibit.

(TAMU), one in nautical archeology and one in
marine biology. There were archeology undergraduates including one from TAMUG. Also on the crew
were young professionals and avocational volunteers from around the country. All gained valuable
practical experience in nautical archeological fieldwork. Some of the students arranged with their
professors for independent-study credit hours, and
for this assistance by several faculty members, the
Denbigh Project is most grateful. Two students from
the Webb Institute of New York joined the project
in the field. Andrew Wiggins and Sam Ernst, the
"Webb boys," were a welcome asset, helping with
topside support and providing their professional perspective on many structural and technological aspects of the Denbigh.

Exhibit
There was a preliminary exhibit on the Denbigh
Project at Galveston's Moody Gardens Discovery
Museum from August 2001-May 2002. The exhibit, centered on the huge connecting rod of the
port engine, was revised, expanded, and displayed

at the TAMUG campus in the foyer of the library
June-November 2002. It is a very good thing to
have an exhibit available to the public during the
fieldwork phase of an archeological project while
interest runs high.

Press day
In promoting public appreciation for heritage
and archeology, the press is an excellent way to
reach large numbers. The project arranged a press
outing to the Denbigh wreck each summer. This
year with the assistance of the TAMU University
Relations Dept. and TAMUG, we held another successful event. There was excellent coverage in local and statewide papers. The Associated Press
picked up the excellent feature story in the Fort
Worth Star Telegram for national and international
distribution (Hanna 2002).

CONCLUSIONS
The project completed the excavation of about
half of the engine room, begun in prior years, concentrating during the 2002 season between the
paddle shaft and the aft or working face of the
boiler. Excavation also focused on the port
paddlewheel and sponson. The feathering hub was
recovered. Again the work revealed few small finds,

archeological potential of the site is far from
exhausted. The bow and the stern need attention as
the next areas for digging and study. Very likely
there are further areas in the hull where important
and intact archeological deposits remain. When the
present reporting phase is complete, INA's Denbigh
Project excavations will continue.

Paleopathology at Jamaica Beach (41GV5),
in Galveston, Texas
Jennifer L. Z. Rice

ABSTRACT
The goal of this study is to provide an assessment of the health of a Hunter-Gatherer population at the
Jamaica Beach site (41GV5) in Galveston, Texas. Skeletal remains of this population were examined for the
presence of the following dental and skeletal lesions: dental enamel hypoplasia, caries, abscesses, periostitis,
porotic hyperostosis, degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis, and trauma. Although all individuals are not
complete, preservation is good. After reconstruction and analysis of the skeletal remains, results show minimal
pathological occurrence within this skeletal population of Jamaica Beach.

INTRODUCTION
On November 10, 1962, a Native American
burial site was discovered on the property of the
Jamaica Beach Development Company on Galveston Island. Heavy equipment stripped approximately
500 dump truck loads of topsoil from the site and
placed it on a single beach lot. After several heavy
rains, artifacts began to surface. The skeletal remains of three individuals were discovered and sent
to the Galveston County Sheriff's Office with the
suspicion of murder. Upon determination that the
remains were Native American, they were eventually turned over to the John Sealy Hospital of the
Texas Medical School and ultimately to the Museum of Natural Science in Houston, Texas.
As public speculation rose, so did rumors of
the origins of the skeletons. Amateur archeologists
noticed the flexed burial positions of the remains
and teeth that were characteristic of Native Americans. Within several days, the site was guarded
against the public and interested treasure seekers.
Unfortunately, people did manage to invade the
area and as a result bones, especially skulls, were
removed from the site.
Dr. T. E. Pulley, who was the director of the
Houston Museum of Natural Science at the time
agreed to protect the site and begin an archaeological investigation. Along with Dr. Pulley, the Houston Archeological Society agreed to work on the
site. There was also an area of the site that had been

badly disturbed by machinery where the public was
allowed to dig. Public interest grew and it is believed that over 20,000 people passed through the
gates of the site. The site itself known as the Jamaica Beach site (41GV5) is situated on Galveston
Island on a ridge between the Gulf of Mexico and
Galveston Bay.
By the conclusion of the excavation, seventeen
human skeletons had been identified, including
fifteen adults and two children. The age range of the
adults was estimated to be from 25-30 years to 6570 years (Ring 1963). In general, the bones were
well preserved. Most teeth, regardless of the age of
the individual, showed extensive wear probably from
chewing sand in association with food (Ring 1963).
The remains were oriented on an east-west axis with
their heads towards the west. Only one individual
was buried directly opposite with the head towards
the east. All individuals were buried in a flexed or
semi-flexed position on their side or back (Ring
1963 ). The remains were found in an area of twenty
feet square with the entire site having a length of
1,050 feet (Aten 1965). Oyster shells were associated
with each grave with one grave having eight Dosinia
shells placed on the femur along with a Dinocardium
shell (Aten 1965). This was referred to as Burial K
and is not in the present collection. According to the
Jamaica Beach map (Aten 1965), one burial
contained bone beads, awls, and a bone pendant.

L. Martin of the Shell Development Co. on the

different shells associated with the burials yielding
an average date of 450 years B.P. (circa AD 1200 to
1500). There were multiple burials with several
having two and three people placed on top of one
another. Ray Ring, a member of the Houston
Archaeological Society who worked at the site,
believes that the burials did not occur simultaneously.
The Dinocardium shell, bone awls, beads and
pendant in the two graves, are the only burial offerings mentioned in the original documentation. There
are a few artifacts such as flint and bone that were
recovered from the site, but they were not associated with any particular burial. There were other
miscellaneous items found including asphaltum,
pumice, and grooved sandstone pieces. Also, according to Ring, a substantial amount of glass, porcelain, and iron pieces were found. A small amount
of these items are in with the skeletal collection
that is presently housed at the Museum of Natural
Science in Houston, Texas. The remains are presumed to be that of Texas Gulf Coast Indians and
are assumed to be the same age as the shells dated.
Unfortunately, there are no field notes or comprehensive and formal site report available for the Jamaica Beach excavation. The most comprehensive
report describing the results of the excavations at
the site was written by Ray Ring (1963 ).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Each skeleton was examined to determine
incidence of porotic hyperostosis (Stuart-Macadam
1982), dental enamel hypoplasia (Buikstra and
Ubelaker 1994), periostitis (Martin et al. 1991; Ortner
and Putschar 1981; Steinbock 1976), osteoarthritis
(Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994), dental lesions, and
trauma. Age and sex of the individuals were
mentioned in the initial summary of the excavation,
but no specific analysis was performed with the
exception of the skulls. In 1965, five crania were
examined for anthropometric and morphological data
(Aten 1965). The procedures used for taking
measurements and reporting morphological
observations were taken from Hrdlicka (1952). The
only other study performed on these skeletal remains
was on Burial I for the purpose of facial reconstruction that was completed by Betty Pat Gatliff.
Both age and sex were determined before the facial
reconstruction (Few et al. 1990). For this study, all
other individuals were sexed and aged using several

different methods because of the varying bones
present in the skeletal sample. Age and sex
assessments were determined as outlined by Bass
(1971), Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994), and Lovejoy
et al. (1985). Where available, cranial suture closure,
dental eruption, epiphyseal closure, and auricular
surface of the ilium were examined in order to
determine the approximate age of each individual.
The development of degenerative joint disease (DJD)
and osteoarthritis also suggested age. Sex was
determined by examination of the greater sciatic
notch, nuchal crest, mastoid process, supra-orbital
margin and ridge, the mental eminence, and long
bone length and circumference.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the original Jamaica Beach archaeological
report, 17 burial pits were recorded (Ring 1963).
Although there were multiple interments in some
instances (more than one individual per grave), only
19 individuals were recorded in the archaeological
record. After reconstruction and examination of the
skeletal remains during this study, it was determined that the minimum number of individuals
(MNI) in the skeletal collection is 27. A category
for dental enamel hypoplasia was not included in
the analysis as it was not observed in the skeletal
remains due to severe attrition present in the dentition. The map of the archaeological site illustrates
that a grave contained remains of two individuals,
labeled Q and P. The remains are labeled P with
two occipitals present in the box. This additional
occipital will be called individual Q. Burial F has a
MNI of 3 individuals therefore the two additional
individuals were given the numbers 16 and 17.

DESCRIPTION OF ANALYSIS
Table 1 provides a description of each burial
including burial number, age and sex of the
individual, presence of any lesion, and the presence
of specific lesions. If sex or presence of a lesion
could not be determined due to a lack of skeletal
material, indeterminable was entered into the table.
Juvenile, subadult, and adult were entered into the
table if a more exact determination of age could not
be determined. Original burial letters assigned during
the initial excavation were used except when there

Rice-Paleopathology at Jamaica Beach (41GV5), in Galveston, Texas
was more than one individual per grave. Of the 27
individuals studied, 11 (41 % ) exhibit some type of
lesion. Burial I is the only individual in the 18-20
year age range and this individual exhibits healed
porotic hyperostosis. The middle aged adult category
is represented by six individuals or 22%, with 5
(19%) revealing some type oflesion. Of the complete
or semi-complete individuals, adults within the
Middle Age category (36 to 49 years of age) are the
most highly represented. Being middle aged would
allow sufficient time for the skeleton to reveal any
chronic illness as well as age dependent conditions.

These individuals with some type of lesion include
Burials D, EE, P, CC, and BB, all of which are male.
The percentage of Young Adults (20 to 35 years of
age) with a lesion is 11 %, including Burials FF, GG,
AA, and one individual of unknown sex and two
males. Older Adults (over 50 years of age) have a
relatively low percentage of lesions (4% ), including
Burial DD, a female with signs of arthritis and
infection. Burial N represents the only adult of
undetermined age having a lesion (arthritis). One
individual, an older male (Burial NN), did not have
any lesions.

Age and Sex of Sample

Of the 27 individuals in the current collection
(Figure 1), five make up the 20-35 year category,
the 36-49 year category contains six, and there are
ten in the indeterminable category. There are two
individuals over the age of 50 and these make up
7% of the sample with the remaining population (4)
being less than 20 years of age (15%). Of the individuals in the collection, ten are male (37%), two
are female (7%), and 15 (56%) are indeterminable.
Of these fifteen, three are sub-adult, and of these
three, two are juveniles. Of the complete and semicomplete individuals, sex distribution parallels the
statement regarding the Jamaica Beach population
made by Ring (1963: 4), "It appears that adult males
outnumber adult females."

Infection
Both specific and non-specific infections were
observed in this skeletal population. Non-specific
infection also known as periosteal reaction can be
caused by in-itation or trauma to the periosteum.
The periosteum is a sheath-like coating around bone
that provides nourishment. Some fibers of the periosteum penetrate bone, while others combine with
tendons to help anchor muscles to bone (White
1991). Periostitis is an inflammatory response by
the periosteum to any infection or trauma and tends
to be superficial. Lesions on the bone are characterized by areas of proliferative, hyper-vascular bone
that create the appearance of "swelling" (Ortner
and Putschar 1981). Bones close to the surface of
the skin, such as the skull and tibia, tend to be the
most affected. Three individuals (17%) had at least
some periosteal reaction present at Jamaica Beach.
The tibia was the most common bone affected.

Burial DD, an older adult female (50+ ),
exhibited signs of infection on the right radius.
Burial CC, an adult male aged 36-49, had a
periosteal reaction on the right tibia. Burial P, also
a middle aged male had periosteal reactions on the
left clavicle and radius, the right femur, both tibiae,
and fibulae. Also present was a cloaca located on
the left ulna indicating osteomyelitis. In Burial S,
all long bones and bones of the hands and feet
appear to have had infection present, but due to
erosion on the bone, it is difficult to be certain of
the severity. This was a middle aged individual
(36-49 years) of undetermined sex.

Porotic Hyperostosis
Porotic hyperostosis is the resultant lesions of
childhood anemia found on the cranial vault. In the
condition of anemia, red blood cell production increases which causes the marrow cavity to expand
(Huss-Ashmore et al. 1982; Walker 1986). The
bones of the skull become thickened, as the diploe
or inner table of man-ow expands. As this expansion takes place, the outer layer of cortex bone
becomes thin which reveals the trabecular bone of
the diploe (Huss-Ashmore et al. 1982). The result
is a porous, sieve-like appearance and thickened
bone with pore-like openings ranging in size from a
pinhole up to two millimeters in diameter (HussAshmore et al. 1982; Ortner and Putschar 1981 ).
When cross sections are viewed, different variations of the condition are seen. The exterior vault of
the skull may be destroyed, while the diploe, although thicker in appearance, remains intact. Occasionally, new bone is added to the skull vault during the disease process while leaving the inner and/
or outer table unaffected (Ortner and Putschar 1981).
Cribra orbitalia refers to similar lesions within
the eye orbits and usually occurs together with porotic hyperostosis. The origin of the diseases is
believed to be the same (Stuart-Macadam 1985,
1987, 1989a, 1989b). Factors that contribute to anemia may include a maize-dependent diet, poor living conditions that invite parasite exposure and infection, and chronic dian-hea. Maternal health during pregnancy and weaning are also possible etiologies. Anemia actively affects the less mineralized skulls of children and indicates iron deficiency
in childhood with the exception of a few cases in
adults (Stuart-Macadam 1985). Porotic hyperostosis mainly affects infants and young children even

Rice-Paleopathology at Jamaica Beach (41GV5), in Galveston, Texas
though evidence of the condition may be seen in
older sub-adults and adult skeletal remains as healed
lesions. Sufficient nutritional intake can aid in the
healing of previously active lesions resultant of a
previous episode of chronic anemia.
In the Jamaica Beach skeletal population, incidence of porotic hyperostosis was detected from
skeletal remains from six individuals. Burial I, an
18-20 year-old female, exhibited healed porotic hyperostosis in the area of the external auditory meatus (EAM). Burial EE, a 36-49 year-old male, had
evidence of healed porotic hyperostosis across the
supra orbital ridge, above the EAM, and several
small areas on the parietals and occipital. Burial P,
a middle aged male aged 36-49, exhibited healed
porotic hyperostosis on the occipital region and in
the eye orbits (cribra orbitalia). Burial FF, a young
adult, contained only fragments; however, porotic
hyperostosis was evident on one small skull fragment. All porotic hyperostosis observed in these
individuals was slight to moderate and was healed.
Food resources of hunters and gatherers vary from
season to season; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that hunting and gathering societies most
likely suffered at least one season of low nutritional
intake during their childhood years, which resulted
in slight cases of anemia.

Degenerative Joint Disease
Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD) is the most
common form of arthritis. It is basically part of
the aging process that occurs mostly in the loadbearing joints. There are two types of joints in the
human body: synarthroses and diarthroses. The
synarthrosis joints are those in which there is little
or no movement such as the pubic symphysis and
sutures of the skull (Steinbock 1976). As a result
of this limited mobility, arthritis does not affect
these joints. Only the diarthroses, also known as
synovial joints are vulnerable to osteoarthritis. Examples of these joints include the hips, knees,
shoulders, and elbows.
In DJD, the destruction of the articular
cartilage occurs in these joints along with
subsequent formation of adjacent bone that is seen
as lipping and spur formations. A combination of
factors contributes to DJD that include age, sex,
hormones, mechanical stress, genetics, trauma, and
bacteria (White 1991). Usually, arthritis occurs in
individuals over the age of fifty, male, and those

145

with large muscles and torsos (Steinbock 1976).
Obviously, the extra weight and size of individuals
forces the joints to work harder and thus, arthritis
becomes more prevalent. As one gets older, the
articular cartilage of the diarthrodial joints
deteriorates which results in abrasion and the
formation of new bone (Steinbock 1976). Along
with maturity, the constant wear and overuse of
joints during life causes the process of degeneration to accelerate. Heavy lifting, constant positions such as squatting and kneeling also contribute
to the degeneration of joints over time. During the
process of severe wear on the joint, the cartilaginous tissue is lost and evidence of eburnation is
seen. The area of bone that was once covered with
cartilage becomes exposed to the opposing bone
and this constant rubbing of the two bones
produces the polishing affect of eburnation.
Evidence of DJD and osteoarthritis or osteophytosis (arthritis in the ve1iebral column) in the
Jamaica Beach population is fairly high with deterioration, osteophytes, and/or eburnation all present
(Figure 2). Most aiihritis observed in the skeletal
sample is located throughout the vertebral column
and bones of the arms. The severity of the arthritis
ranges from slight to moderate with some vertebral
lipping (osteophytes) seen in the middle aged and
older adults. Burial D, a 36-49 year-old male, that
is the individual buried in a different position (east
to west orientation), had a cleft atlas and subsequent arthritis on the cervical vertebrae C2, C3, C4
and CS. The facets are flattened and appear to have
been compressed together (See Developmental Defects below). Burial EE, a middle aged male, had
arthritis present on the distal end of the left humerus, semilunar notch of the left ulna, and on the

right talus. Burial P, a middle aged male, had arthritis in both feet, the distal ends of both ulnas
(eburnation present on both), and the proximal ends
of both radii. Burial DD, an older female (50+) and
Burial GG, a young male (20-35), had osteoarthritis along their vertebral columns. Burial CC, a
middle aged male, exhibited arthritis on the distal
end of the left humerus and humeral head, and both
semilunar notches. Burial BB, a 36-49 year-old
male, had arthritis on the first, left metatarsal and
the left semilunar notch of the ulna. Burial N, a
male of unknown age, had arthritis present on the
distal end of the right humerus and proximal end of
the right ulna. Arthritis was also present on several
vertebral fragments of this individual.

Dentition
Information regarding the diet and health of
prehistoric populations can be obtained from the
analysis of teeth (Goodman 1991; Rose et al. 1985).
The presence of dental lesions, although nonspecific, can suggest nutritional stress. Therefore, the
study of dental lesions becomes an important aspect of skeletal analyses. The dentition can provide
insight to diet and techniques of food preparation
and consumption in archaeological populations as
well as the age of individuals (Powell 1985). Mechanical, chemical, and pathogenic stresses from
diet affect teeth upon their eruption into the oral
cavity. The relationship between these factors in
combination with general tooth morphology and
environmental factors, influence the dental health
of populations (Powell 1985).
The loss of the occlusal surface of the tooth
and the interproximal surface area between the
teeth is generally known as dental wear (Martin et
al. 1991). Wear of the teeth has been divided into
two different components: dental attrition which
is a result of tooth to tooth contact, and dental
abrasion, which results from contact of foreign
objects on the tooth itself (Scott and Turner 1988).
.Most degrees of dental wear are not considered
pathological since attrition is the result of masticatory stress on the dentition through nutritional
and technological activities (Powell 1985). Most
wear of the teeth is simply a result of normal
chewing processes (Figure 3).
The number of teeth available for analysis in
this collection was minimal. Most teeth were
extremely worn with shortening of the tooth and

Figure 3. Dental attrition, 41GV5, Skeleton HH.

exposed dentin. Only one individual, a young female
(Burial I) had slightly worn teeth compared to other
41 GV5 individuals, while the teeth of the juveniles
exhibited no wear. Of the ten graves that contained
teeth, two had caries and one had an abscess. Burial
D, a middle aged male, had one carie present on the
upper right second incisor (RI2). Burial AA, a
young male, had several caries. Both upper canines
had caries as well as the first lower right molar
(RM 1) and the first and second lower left molars
LM 1 and LM2 . The only abscess in the collection
was found in an individual in Burial HH, a male of
indeterminable age. The abscess is located just
below the lower left incisors.
Burial GG, although fragmentary, contained a
mandible with no teeth intact. Resorption was evident around the entire mandible indicating that this
young male lost his teeth well before death. Deciduous teeth in the Jamaica Beach collection were
found in Burials Ia, F, and GG. There was no evidence of dental enamel hypoplasia (DEH) or dental
hypocalcification in this collection. These conditions may have been present in the Jamaica Beach
population in life before the dentition became severely worn.
There are two carious individuals in the collection. These make up 7% of the total collection
and 20% of the individuals with teeth. The frequency of caries and abscesses at 41GV5 are low,
but since there are only ten individuals in the collection with at least one tooth, the true frequency
is impossible to know.

Trauma
There is no clear case of trauma in the Jamaica
Beach population. Burial P exhibits the only case of

Rice-Paleopathology at Jamaica Beach (41GV5), in Galveston, Texas
possible trauma in the collection. The left fibula may
have a healed fracture but it is difficult to be certain
without an x-ray. This was not possible as the
collection could not be removed from the museum.
Although not pathological, hyperossification
at muscle attachment sites alters the shape of the
bone where repetitive use of muscles occurs. This
condition is seen in several individuals at Jamaica
Beach. Burial GG, a young male, had evidence of
muscle development along both arms. Burial BB,
a middle aged adult, had a projection on the right
humerus at the distal end. This may be the result
of large muscle development. An older female,
Burial DD, had signs of muscle development on
the right and left humeri. Individuals at Jamaica
beach exhibited signs of varying degrees of muscle
attachment. Bones of the arms (wrists and shoulders) are most affected.

Developmental Disorders
The only obvious case of a developmental defect in the collection was seen in Burial D. The
atlas vertebra had a cleft posterior neural arch that
is an opening of the posterior arch (Figure 4). There
was also compensatory overgrowth of the left side
of the vertebra. The inferior facet of the C2 vertebra and superior facet of C3 were compressed into
each other as well as the C4 and CS vertebrae.
Again, this was observed only on the individual
that was buried in a different orientation from the
remainder of the Jamaica Beach population. Although only one individual exhibits this defect
(1/27 =4% ), the frequency of this occun-ence equals
the expected frequency of cleft atlas for any population (Bailey 1974).

147

CONCLUSION
Generally, overall health of the population at
Jamaica Beach was good. The skeletal remains in
the sample reveal stress markers that would be expected in a hunting and gathering society. Diet plays
a major role in the health of an individual, but
lifestyle also affects the human body. Most afflictions or evidence of pathological occurrences in the
Jamaica Beach population are the result of accidents, such as periosteal reactions, or degenerative
processes such as osteoarthritis and dental attrition.
Periosteal reactions observed in this skeletal sample
are minimal and most were not severe with the
exception of one individual. These skeletal remains
exhibit a possible case of congenital treponematosis indicative of infectious disease. The majority of
the arthritis in the sample is located in the vertebral
column, arms and feet and most likely associated
with aging and physiological wear. Arthritis of the
feet may be the result of the environment. Walking
in sand puts extra stress on the muscles of the feet
more so than walking on a flat surface. Substantial
muscle development was seen in several of the
individuals, including females.
The diet of the Jamaica Beach Indians was
most likely varied and seasonal which provided a
wide range of food. The dentition of the individuals
shows severe attrition that is common in hunters
and gatherers due to a diet containing foods rough
in texture. This rough texture of food along with
required vigorous mastication contributed to dental
attrition. Also, these coastal Indians must have encountered sand in the diet that can also account for
severe attrition (Ring 1963).
The small sample size of the collection and
limited documentation of the excavation made for
difficult analyses. Several individuals are boxed
together and not labeled. Further reconstruction and
analysis will be helpful in adding to the number of
complete or almost complete individuals.

Recovery and Interpretation of Fungal Pathogens of Maize
from Mimbres-Mogollon Archeological Sites
Michael W. Pendleton, Dale Newton, and Bonnie B. Pendleton

ABSTRACT
Common fungal pathogens of modern corn (Zea maize) are described with explanations of how these
pathogens could be traced through macrobotanical and microbotanical samples from prehistoric MimbresMogollon archeological sites. Problems with interpretation of evidence of prehistoric fungal outbreaks are
discussed. Research on fungal activity at a Mimbres-Mogollon archeological site is described. The method may
have potential for identifying evidence of agricultural production at sites occupied by agriculturalists in the
Caddo and Jornada Mogollon regions of Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The prehistoric Mogollon people occupied
southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico,
western Texas, and northern Mexico from A.D. 220
to 1150 (Wheat 1955:3). The Mimbres-Mogollon
branch of the Mogollon occupied the Mimbres River
and its tributaries, the upper areas of the Gila River,
and the lower San Francisco River (LeBlanc
1986:297). Maize (Zea mays) was the primary crop
of the Mimbres-Mogollon people of the Southwest
from the Late Pithouse through Classic phases from
approximately A.D. 550 to 1150 (LeBlanc 1983).
Fungal pathogens might have influenced yields and
stored supplies of maize during the occupation periods of the Mimbres-Mogollon. This study examines
how fungal outbreaks may be traced and interpreted
in the archeological record.

DISEASES OF MAIZE
Although diseases of maize may be caused by
such agents as bacteria, flowering parasitic plants,
fungi, mycoplasmas, nematodes and viruses, this report primarily discusses fungal parasites of maize.
The fungi are simple, filamentous organisms that do
not have chlorophyll and commonly reproduce by
producing spores spread by wind and/or other vectors, such as insects. Many of the fungal diseases of
maize are called smuts or rusts (Chlistensen 1951:31).

Ustilago zeae is one of the many fungi that
cause smut of maize. Corn smut grows in stems,
ears, and tassels of the maize plant and produces
galls on the outer surface of the plant. Infestation of 10 percent of plants in a field is considered a moderate infection in modern maize-growing regions of the world (Christensen 1951:31).
Other fungal pathogens of maize include
Puccinia sorghi, a common rust fungus that infected an average of 51 percent of maize plants
in Minnesota in 1977 (Kommedahl et al.
1978:692). Helminthosporium pedicellatum is a
fungal pathogen that causes root rot in maize
and caused economic damage in California in
the 1960s (Shepherd et al. 1966:52-56). Sorghum
downy mildew (Sclerospora sorghi) is a fungus
that attacks sorghum and maize in the central
United States and was reported in areas of New
Mexico in 1973 (Frederisksen and Ullstrup
1975:39). These fungal pathogens (mildews, root
rots, rusts and smuts) infect present-day fields
where tilling is practiced and also fields that are
not tilled.
During the 1980s, research was directed to
identifying plant pathogens of maize produced
without tillage due in part to increasing use by
farmers of minimum-tillage agriculture. Infestation by the fungal pathogen Cercospora zeaemaydis occurred more frequently in the southern
United States because of no-tillage farming
(Latterell and Rossi 1983:842). Cercospora zeae-

maydis infected as much as 69 percent of maize
crops in no-tillage fields in Maryland (Smith and
Grybauskas 1985:1366). Not only does the use
of minimum tillage increase the incidence and
severity of fungal diseases (compared to that in
fields cultivated by conventional methods), but
also continuous planting of maize in the same
field causes the disease to spread because of
buildup of fungal spores (Shurtleff et al. 1977 :2).
If the Mimbres-Mogollon grew maize in the same
fields for many seasons and presumably did not
use a plow to till the fields, accumulations of
spores of the fungus in the soil could have caused
a decrease in yields of maize over time.
Minnis (1978: 360) postulated that as prehistoric Mimbres-Mogollon population increased in
the Mimbres Valley, riparian plant species were
exploited more extensively, resulting in a lowering of the water table and subsequent increase in
soil erosion. A lower water table combined with
an increase in erosion may have resulted in
warmer soil temperatures and lower humidity
during prehistoric times. These dry conditions
favor the development of corn smut but hamper
the development of most rusts of maize during
modern times (Shurtleff et al. 1977:31-34).
However, present-day reactions of a specific
smut or rust pathogen to specific temperature
and humidity levels may have evolved from a
reaction that was different during MimbresMogollon times. Therefore, it is difficult to determine which fungal pathogens may have been
favored for the environmental conditions postulated to have occurred during the MimbresMogollon occupation.
Following harvest, fungal pathogens that
commonly attack stored maize are called storage
rots. Storage rots may infest either shelled or
whole cobs of maize shortly after harvest or years
after being placed in storage, at which time a
production of toxins may occur which make the
maize inedible. These storage rots include many
fungi, one of which is Aspergillus. If maize is
stored with moisture less than 15% and at temperatures less than 10 degrees Celsius, Aspergillus will not thrive, but when grain with more
than 15% moisture is stored at temperatures of
21 to 32 degrees Celsius, the fungi may infest
entire storage bins with no apparent external
symptoms until damage is well advanced
(Shurtleff et al. 1977:47).

USING MACROBOTANICAL
EVIDENCE TO TRACE
PATHOGENS OF MAIZE
Martin et al. (1952) thought the MimbresMogollon subsistence base shifted from the hunting and gathering of the Cochise Archaic to a horticulture/pottery complex by 2300 B.P. Maize was a
c1itical resource during the horticulture/pottery complex period. Minnis (1981:176) commented that it
was clear from an analysis of Mimbres Foundation
excavation data that agricultural products, particularly maize, were critical resources for people during the Late Pithouse to Salado phases of the
Mimbres-Mogollon.
Minnis (1981:243-246) also noted that maize
was one of the most frequent archeological plant
remains recovered from flotation samples from
Mimbres Foundation excavations in the Mimbres
Valley. Flotation recovers such fragile macrobotanical matelials as seeds and other plant fragments large enough to see without magnification.
However, maize kernels recovered by flotation probably are under-represented because maize usually
was ground before eating and would not preserve
well (Bohrer 1976:245-250). Minnis (1981:243)
also explained that most macrobotanical remains
recovered by using flotation were individual charred
cupules so that cob characteristics such as kernel
row number could not be determined easily. He
also noted that most examples of maize recovered
by using flotation were so small and incomplete
that few features useful to determine the attributes
of the yield of a prehistoric maize crop could be
determined. Charred cupules of maize, like other
carbonized botanical material, may become waterlogged and lose buoyancy during processing by
flotation (French 1971 :62). Carbonized botanical
materials from arid environments may commonly
be coated with calcium carbonate and become nonbuoyant during flotation (Minnis and LeBlanc
1976:492). Therefore, froth flotation devices, rather
than tub-type flotation devices, should be used to
recover charred cupules because froth flotation recovers non-buoyant carbonized seed materials (such
as maize cupules) more efficiently than does the
tub-type flotation method (Pendleton 1983:615).
While carbonized macrobotanical remains of
maize are underrepresented in the archeological
record, carbonized macrobotanical remains of
maize infected with fungus would be even more

Pendleton, et. al -Fungal Pathogens of Maize from Mimbres-Mogollon Archeological Sites
under-represented because infected cobs would not
be taken from the field and therefore would have
little chance for preservation at a habitation or
firepit. Even if infested cobs were burned for
warmth or for cooking, it would be unlikely that
fungal mycelium would be recovered after cobs (or
kernels) were carbonized. The thin-walled mycelium of most fungi is not adapted to withstand desiccation or the stresses of carbonization (Weier et
al. 1974:461). Occasionally, head smut may create
spore masses that are black and loose and completely destroy the ear of maize (De Leon 1984:60).
Although an infestation of corn smut may render
plants barren or may cause them to produce many
very small ears (Shurtleff et al. 1977:31), evidence
of these conditions may be difficult to detect even
in macrobotanical soil samples from fields of maize.
If the fortuitous preservation of an intact spore mass
were recovered from a Mimbres-Mogollon site, it
would be difficult to interpret the importance of
such a spore mass to loss of yield. This is because a
single spore mass could contain millions of spores
and could cause significant crop loss if released
under humidity and temperature conditions adequate
for germination. Unfavorable temperature and humidity would not usually produce significant fungal damage to crops. Macrobotanical evidence of
outbreaks of storage rot fungi occurring during the
Mimbres-Mogollon occupation could be based on
the recovery of carbonized cobs of maize infested
with storage rot from granary bins (if the room was
burned). The significance of this evidence would
be determined by assessment of the degree of fungal outbreak, the extent of the loss to the stored
maize, and the time of the outbreak in relation to
the next harvest.

USING MICROBOTANICAL
EVIDENCE TO TRACE
PATHOGENS OF MAIZE
It is difficult to use microbotanical analysis (such

as spores) from soil samples to trace fungal pathogens of maize. Although extraction and analysis of
plant pollen from archeological sites has become
common, similar research of fungal spores from
archeological sites is not as widespread. Fungal
spores generally are more easily destroyed than are
pollen grains by the process used to extract pollen
and spores from soil samples (Graham 1962:63).

151

Although fungal keys and identification books (for
example Duran 1987; Ellis and Ellis 1989; Fischer
1953) are useful for general identification of fungi,
Elsik et al. (1990:91) noted that fossil fungal spores
are relatively untreated as taxonomic entities in the
published literature. Most pollen grains are easier to
locate on a slide and identify than are the spores of
most taxa of corn smut by using a light microscope
because the average size of pollen grains is 20-50
micrometers in diameter (Kapp 1969:3) while, for
example, the size range of Ustilago zeae (com smut)
spores is 8-12 micrometers in diameter (Christensen
1951:31). However, Graham (1962:60-65) described
several positive aspects of the use of all kinds of
fungal spores to trace paleoecological changes at an
archeological site. He noted that most kinds of fungal spores are often present in pollen samples in
greater quantities than are pollen grains, and the
morphological characteristics of fungal spores allow many kinds to be positively identified. Graham
(1962:60-65) also mentioned that the recovery of
spores of host-specific fungi from archeological sites
indirectly indicated the presence of the host plant
when other paleobotanical evidence such as host
plant pollen grains, seeds or plant fragments could
not be recovered.
Although Davis and Goodlett (1960) directly
attempted to correlate vegetation abundance and
patterns with pollen grain taxa recovered from soil
samples from plant communities producing these
patterns, a similar study would be difficult to complete with a fungal pathogen such as a corn smut or
rust. For example, Puccinia (one genera of corn
smut) produces five distinct kinds of reproductive
cells: urediniospores, teliospores, basidiospores,
spermatia, and aeciospores (Bold 1973:201). To
identify these spores, a reference collection would
ideally include all five kinds of cells for each species of Puccinia. In contrast, plant species, however, usually produce only one morphologically distinct kind of pollen grain so only examples of this
kind would be required for identification. It would
be difficult because of the reproductive capability
of the fungus to use concentrations of Puccinia
spores (all five kinds) from a soil sample from a
site to determine the infection rate in maize fields
surrounding the site. For example, mycelium arising from the germination of just one urediniospore
may produce several thousand more urediniospores,
and urediniospore cycles may be repeated many
times during a single maize-growing season (Bold

1973:200). Because Puccinia may have more than
one host (Bold 1973:200), spore concentrations in
samples of soil from prehistoric farm fields should
be considered when estimating the relative abundance of one host in relation to others and levels of
infestation of maize by Puccinia. Microbotanical
evidence of storage rots in maize during the
Mimbres-Mogollon occupation could be based on
the recovery of storage rot spores from soil samples
from Mimbres-Mogollon granary bins.
In an article by Pendleton (1998:41), spores of
a fungal pathogen of grasses (Tilletia) were
recovered from soil samples from site LA 15049
(Nan Ranch), a Mimbres-Mogollon archeological
site in southern New Mexico. This site was occupied
during the Pithouse to Late Classic Mimbres cultural
periods (Shafer 1988:7). Soil was collected from
11 rooms at the site (Pendleton 1993) but spores of
Tilletia were found only in one sample (Figure 1)
from one room occupied at the time the site was
abandoned (Pendleton 1998). Although Pendleton's
(1998) research presented only limited information
about the cultural use of these fungal spores and the
possible host species of this fungi (maize is not
known to be a host of Tilletia ), it demonstrated that

fungal spores could be recovered from a MimbresMogollon archeological site in significant enough
amounts to be analyzed as a feature of a site.

SUMMARY
Many difficult problems are associated with
recovery and interpretation of fungal pathogens of
maize or other plants associated with MimbresMogollon archeological sites. While a study by Graham (1962:60-68) highlighted general aspects of
interpreting data on fungal spores from soil samples,
research is required to define new methods to analyze and understand the impact of quantities of prehistoric fungal pathogens on yields of maize from
the Mimbres-Mogollon region and at archeological
sites in other regions occupied by agriculturalists.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Pollen/Sporn taxa
Bar graph of numbers of pollen taxa recovered from Site LA 15049, Room 60, Sample 12 (Pendleton 1993). The ChenoAm category (Martin 1963:49) includes pollen that cannot be distinguished between the Chenopodiaceae family and the
Amaranthus genera by using light microscopy.

Pendleton, et. al -Fungal Pathogens of Maize from Mimbres-Mogollon Archeological Sites
Pollen grains and fungal spores from soil samples
from site LA 15049 were extracted at the
Palynological Laboratory (Dr. Vaughn Bryant, Jr.,
Director), Texas A&M University, College Station,
Texas. Funding for the extraction and analysis of
pollen grains and spores from site LA 15049 was
provided by a Texas A&M University College of
Liberal Arts Dissertation Award, a Texas A&M
University Academic Excellence Award, and a
Texas A&M University Association of Former
Students Mini-grant.
