ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted an archaeological
survey of an 84-acre tract in central Bexar County on August 31, 2006 and
September 1, 2006 for Rosillo Creek Development Ltd. of Laredo, Texas. The
area investigated will be a residential subdivision entitled Palo Alto Trails (Los
Missiones). This action was initiated by a request from the City of San Antonio,
Office of Historic Preservation. The Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division has no jurisdiction in this project; therefore, an antiquities permit was not
required.
One prehistoric site (41BX1690) was found at the western edge of the
project area adjacent to Leon Creek. This site consisted of a surface scatter of
flakes, a few pieces of burned rock, and a tested cobble. Shovel testing yielded
few artifacts, and revealed the site to be mainly confined to the rocky surface.
This site is not viewed by BVRA as significant. No artifacts were collected.
One area of interest dating to the Historic period was found in the
southwest corner of the project area. This is an old crossing of the creek as
evidenced by a deep depression between 15 and 18 feet into the natural surface.
It is still used by the current landowner as a crossing, but its age is not known.
Therefore, no site number was assigned.

Copies of the report are on file at the City of San Antonio, Office of Historic
Preservation; Texas Historical Commission; Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory; Rosillo Creek Development Ltd.; and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
Rosillo Creek Development Ltd. proposes construction of a subdivision to
be known as Palo Alto Trails (Los Missiones) on an 84-acre tract of land within
the city limits of San Antonio, Texas in central Bexar County (Figure 1). The
property is bounded on the north by Loop 410, on the south by private property,
on the east by private development (apartments and a gas staton), and on the
west by Leon Creek. The major drainage basin in the area is the San Antonio
River. In addition to Leon Creek, the site is drained by Comanche Creek at the
eastern end of the 84-acre tract. The project area is depicted on the 7.5â USGS
topographic map Terrell Wells dated 1967 and photorevised 1973 (2998-241
(Figure 2).
This project will consist of three phases, is scheduled to begin in 2006,
and be completed in 2009. Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) will
provide part of the funding for this project. This funding is provided by TIRZ to
developers for lands that are hard to develop, underdeveloped, or blighted.
The engineering firm for this project is Torres Engineering of San Antonio,
Texas. Construction of the subdivision will consist of commercial and residential
lots, streets, utilities, a sewer system, and green space areas or parks. The
entire tract will be cleared of its natural vegetation, and ornamental trees and
shrubs will be planted throughout the development.
No archaeological investigations by professional archaeologists have
been conducted in the project area. However, sites have been found in the
vicinity, and the presence of two streams (Comanche Creek and Leon Creek)
makes the project area a likely setting for a prehistoric or historic site. In order to
avoid adverse impacts to significant cultural resources, Kay Hindes, staff
archaeologist for the San Antonio Historic Preservation Office, requested a
professional archaeologist examine the area. In order to comply with this request,
Rosillo Creek Development Ltd. retained BVRA examine the 84 acres for
significant archaeological sites. The legislation regulating cultural resources is
the City of San Antonioâs âHistoric and Preservation Design Section of the Unified
Development Code (Article 6 35-630 to 35-634).â Disturbance of any site or the
collection of artifacts from any site on City property prior to a determination of
significance is a violation of the code. Since this is a privately funded project that
falls under the jurisdiction of the City of San Antonio, an antiquities permit from
the Texas Historical Commission is not required.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
The following information was taken from the Handbook of Texas (Webb
1952), the Texas Almanac (2004), and the soil survey for Bexar County (Taylor
et al. 1991). Bexar County is located in south-central Texas about 190 miles
(305 km) west of Houston and 140 miles (225 km) inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
It is 1257 square miles in size, of which 10 square miles (0.78%) are covered by
water. The Balcones Escarpment bisects the county from west to northeast. To
the north of the escarpment are the rocky hills, springs, and canyons of the
Texas Hill Country. South of the escarpment are the Blackland Prairie and the
South Texas Plains. The San Antonio River rises from springs north of
downtown San Antonio and flows southward and southeastward through the
county. Minerals in the area consist of gravel, sand, limestone, oil, and gas. The
altitude of the county varies from 486 feet above sea level to 1892 feet above
sea level. Annual rainfall is 31.0 inches. Temperatures average between 38
degrees Fahrenheit (January mean minimum) to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (July
mean maximum).
Project Area Soils
According to the soil survey for Bexar County (Taylor et al. 1991), there
are five soil types in the project area. In the area between Comanche Creek and
State Highway 16 is Houston black gravelly clay, 1 to 3% slopes (Hub). On the
margins of Comanche Creek is Trinity clay and Frio clay loam, frequently flooded
(Tf) and Houston black gravelly clay, 1 to 3% slopes (HuB). Between Comanche
Creek and Leon Creek is Lewisville silty clay, 0 to 1% slopes (LvA). Between the
LvA soils and the upland margin of Leon Creek is Gullied land, eroded (Gu).
These soils are defined below. Along the Leon Creek floodplain is Frio clay loam
(Fr). Project area soils are illustrated in Figure 3 below.
Fr soils are described by Taylor et al. (1991:16) as sandy loam to clay
loam soils found mainly on the floodplains of the San Antonio River, the Medina
River, and their major tributaries or on low terraces bordering their floodplains.
This soil floods occasionally. The surface is uneven and in a few places is
dissected by partly filled old stream channels in which water stands for short
periods following floods. The surface layer is about 20 inches thick. The
subsurface layer is light brownish-gray in color and is about 5 inches thick.
Below a depth of 25 to 30 inches, the texture ranges from sandy loam through
stratified loam to clay loam. The depth to water-rounded limestone gravel ranges
from 3 to 6 feet or more. This soil is limy throughout.

Figure 3. Project Area Soils

Gu soils are descried by Taylor et al. (1991:17) as occurring along rivers
and streams where high terraces break to floodplains. The topography is rough,
and the slope is generally between 12% and 20%. In many places, however, it is
more than 50%. Gullying and sheet erosion are severe. An intricate network of
shallow and deep gullies cover covers 80% to 90% of the area. These gullies
may be 5 feet to 75 feet wide, 4 feet to 30 feet deep, and 3 feet to 50 feet apart.
The soil material consists of grayish-brown or light grayish-brown, strongly
calcareous loam, clay loam, or silty clay derived from alluvium. It washes off the
steep, exposed slopes so rapidly that there is not enough time for a soil profile to
develop.
HuB soils are described by Taylor et al. (1991:21) as clayey soils found in
the uplands, mainly along smooth convex slopes and short undulating slopes
along drainage ways. The surface layer is black and about 38 inches thick.
Cracks form when it dries. Gravel ordinarily makes up 8% to 18% of this layer by
volume. On long narrow ridge tops gravels may constitute 60% by volume. The
subsurface layer, about 12 inches thick, is clay or gravelly clay. The gravel is
discontinuous. When it occurs, however, it makes up 30% to 60% of this layer by
volume. The pebbles range from half an inch to three inches in diameter. Runoff
is medium or slow.
LvA soils are described by Taylor et al. (1991:25) as clayey soils found on
nearly level broad terraces along rivers and creeks. The surface layer is either
silty or light clay and is about 24 inches thick. The subsurface layer is brown silty
clay that is very firm but crumbly when moist. It is 20 inches thick.
Tf soils are described by Taylor et al. (1991:32) as clayey soils found in
long and irregularly shaped areas on the floodplains of small streams and the
larger field drainage ways. These soils flood at least once a year, generally after
a heavy rain. Some areas are subject to a thin deposition of sediments, and
others to scouring or shifting. Stream channels in these areas are poorly defined
and of small capacity. Trinity soils are 3 to 5 feet deep. The surface layer
ranges from clay loam to gravelly clay in texture. Ordinarily the subsurface layer
is clay, but in places in contains thin loam strata. Frio soils are 3 to 4 feet deep
and are somewhat more clayey and darker colored than the Frio clay loams that
occur on the floodplains of the larger streams and rivers.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Bexar County is located in the Central Texas Cultural-geographical region
of Texas as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:Figure 15) and the Central Texas
Archeological Region as defined by Mercado-Allinger et al. (1996:Figure 1.1.4).
In 1985, when the statistical overview was published by Biesaart et al., there
were 3507 recorded archaeological sites in region. Bexar County had 443 sites,
which accounted for 12.63% of the region and 2.9% of the state. Only two
counties, Travis (n=417) and Williamson (n=425) were close in numbers of sites
recorded. Prior to newly recorded site 41BX1690, there were over 1600
recorded sites in Bexar County. The large number of sites in Bexar County has
been recorded due to urban development (i.e., San Antonio), oil and gas
production, road construction, surface mining, reservoir construction, and an
active archaeological society (South Texas Archaeological Association).
Prehistoric sites in Bexar County vary in age from Paleo-Indian to Late
Prehistoric, and Historic sites date from the early days of Mexican settlement
through the Present. In 1985, there were 30 recorded Paleo-Indian sites, 38
Early Archaic sites, 51 Middle Archaic sites, 60 Late Archaic sites, 58 General
Archaic sites, and 57 Late Prehistoric sites. At that time 34 sites had been listed
in the National Register of Historic Places, and 71 sites had received the
designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Bexar County is located in a
part of Texas that was heavily populated by citizens of Mexico, and this is
reflected in early Spanish missions, presidios, and towns. Unfortunately, many of
the prehistoric and early historic sites have suffered some form of disturbance
from factors such as erosion, construction, and vandalism.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A records check at TARL revealed that three prehistoric archaeological
sites have been recorded along Leon Creek in the vicinity of the current project
area. Two sites (41BX599 and 41BX1544) are described on the site form as
lithic scatters with little or no depth. Site 41BX1544 consists of a slight surface
scatter with buried deposits found between 20 and 70 cm. The majority of buried
materials were found between 60 and 70 cm. These sites are discussed in more
detail below. No sites have been recorded along Comanche Creek within the
project area or in the immediate vicinity.
41BX599
This site was recorded as the âBarrow Pit siteâ in 1983 by the Center for
Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio during a
survey for a City of San Antonio pipeline right-of-way (Snavely et al. 1984). The
site is described on the site form as a âthin lithic scatter with no buried deposits.â
It is located on the east bank of Leon Creek approximately 1600 meters
southeast of newly recorded site 41BX1690 (Figure 2). At the time of this survey,
this site had been disturbed through erosion, agricultural activities, and nearby
borrow pits. The site is small (5 x 10 meters) and contains gray sandy loam to 30
cm. Artifacts observed include thin biface fragments, cores, flakes, and
fragments of burned rock. Although a Clear Fork tool was found in the borrow
pit, there is no statement on the site form regarding the age of this site. No
collection was made. No comment regarding the research potential of this site
appears on the site form.
41BX704
This site was recorded in 1986 by the State Department of Highways and
Public Transportation (now Texas Department of Transportation) during a survey
along Loop 410 in advance of highway modifications (State Department of
Highways and Public Transportation 1996). The site is described on the site
form as an âopen campsiteâ with no features noted. It is located on a steep bluff
overlooking the east bank of Leon Creek approximately 120 meters north of
newly recorded site 41BX1690 (Figure 2). At the time of this survey, this site had
been disturbed through erosion and highway and bridge construction. It is
believed that this site extends to the north onto private property, but that portion
within the area examined is described on the site form as destroyed. The size of
the site within the project area is estimated to be at least 100 square meters.
The depth is unknown due to modern disturbances. Artifacts observed include a
light scatter of lithic debris mixed with broken road gravels and small cobbles.
Ground stone fragments and occasional burned or âfire-reddenedâ limestone rock
fragments were also noted. Although no diagnostic artifacts were observed, the
site form states that it is either Archaic and/or Late Prehistoric. No comments
regarding the research potential of this site appears on the site form.

41BX1544
This site was recorded in 2003 by Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Doublas,
Inc. during a survey for the proposed Kelly Parkway (Ahr 2004). The site is
described on the site form as a âlithic scatterâ with possible buried fire-cracked
rock features. It is located in an open fallow agricultural field about 300 meters
west of Leon creek approximately 150 meters southwest of newly recorded site
41BX1690 (Figure 2). At the time of this survey, this site had been disturbed
through erosion and plowing, but the majority of the site appeared to be intact.
The size of the site within the project area is estimated to be 60 x 70 meters. The
thickness of deposits is described on the site form as between 20 and 70 cm
below the existing ground surface. Artifacts observed include lithic debitage, firecracked rock, rabdotus snail shells, and a few freshwater mussel shell fragments.
No diagnostic artifacts were observed, and the site is described as unknown
prehistoric. One possible feature containing fire-cracked rock at the center of the
site at 60 cm below the surface was observed in a shovel test. Several large
rocks and rock fragments were recovered along with some reddened sandstone.
In the same zone there was a dramatic increase in the number of rabdotus snails
and lithic debitage. The researchers state that this site may be eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places. Test units to determine its
significance are recommended.

METHODS
Prior to the field survey, the Principal Investigator discussed the project
with Kay Hindes, Staff Archaeologist for the City of San Antonio, to make sure
the proper area would be investigated and the methods proposed by BVRA
would be acceptable. Maps were obtained from Jason Arcechiga of Rosillo
Creek Development Ltd. Jean Hughes at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory was contacted in an attempt to identify any known sites in the project
area and vicinity.
The field survey consisted of an on-site visit by James E. Warren, Art
Romine, and Bobby Jemison on August 31, 2006 and September 1, 2006. The
entire project area was traversed on foot in an attempt to locate evidence of a
prehistoric or historic site. Transects were not possible along the creek because
of thick brush. The survey crew walked over this area as thoroughly as possible
and excavated shovel tests where the soil permitted. The rest of the project area
was examined by walking transects with 30-meter intervals. Shovel tests were
excavated throughout this area. All excavated earth was passed through Â¼ inch
hardware cloth, and the results were documented using a shovel test log
(Appendix I). In all, 30 shovel tests were excavated.
A large portion of the project area had already been disturbed (Figure 4).
Comanche Creek has been straightened, and some roads for the subdivision
were already in place. The survey crew estimated that approximately 1/3 of the
84 acres was not available for survey because of this disturbance.
Photographs of the project area were taken with a digital camera, and a
hand-held GPS was used to record the center point of site 41BX1690. The
landowner, James Netts, was interviewed regarding past use of the project area
and the two archaeological sites present. Figure 5 depicts the approximate
location of shovel tests in the project area.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The project area consisted of thick woods near the creek and pasture and
scattered trees in the rest of the tract (Figure 6). As stated above, a significant
portion of the project area had been disturbed through construction of the
proposed subdivision. Two streams are depicted on the topographic map and
aerial photo in the published soil survey as being adjacent to or within the project
area. Leon Creek, which parallels the western edge of the project area,
contained very little water at the time of this investigation. It was not a flowing
stream, and only a few scattered pools of water were visible (see cover).
Comanche Creek, which flows through the eastern portion of the project area,
had been completely disturbed through various forms of construction such as
channelization.

One prehistoric archaeological site was found to be present in the project
area. Site 41BX1690 is a lithic scatter confined mainly to the surface with no
features present. This prehistoric site consists of a scatter of lithic debitage over
an area of at least 770 square meters (Figures 2 and 5). It is located on the
second terrace on the east bank of Leon Creek. Artifacts observed include
flakes, burned rock, and one tested cobble. Eleven shovel tests were excavated
in the site area, and three were positive.
Artifacts recovered from shovel testing included one fire-fractured chert
fragment at 10 cm (Shovel Test 3), one chert percussion flake at 20 cm (Shovel
Test 4), and three secondary chert flakes and five tertiary chert flakes in a
disturbed context; depth not known (Shovel Test 6). The tests on the site were
terminated at depths of 20 to 60 cm when clay with calcium carbonate inclusions
was encountered. This site is typical of others found in the area (see Previous
Investigations above). According to Mr. Netts, projectile points have been found
at this site in the past. Poor ground surface visibility in the site area (estimated at
20%) made it difficult for the crew to observe much of the ground surface.
Therefore, formal tools may have been present at the time of this survey but
simply not visible. BVRA does not consider site 41BX1690 to be eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark because of the shallow, disturbed nature of the
deposits, paucity of artifacts, and apparent lack of features.
An area of interest that dates to the Historic period was found in the
southwest corner of the project area (Figure 6). This is a depression in the edge
of the second terrace that is reputed to be a historic crossing of Leon Creek.
This terrace extends between 15 and 18 feet into the creek bank. According to
Mr. Netts, this depression was there when he moved to the area 35 years ago,
and his family still uses it as a creek crossing. Since it is not known that the age
of this crossing exceeds 50 years, no site number was assigned. Thick brush
prevented the crew from taking a good quality photograph.

14

RECOMMENDATIONS
One archaeological site was recorded during this survey. Site 41BX1690
is not considered eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or
for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. It is recommended that
construction be allowed to continue as planned. Should the size of the project
area increase in size, additional survey by a professional archaeologist may be
necessary. If evidence of a prehistoric or historic site not mentioned in this report
is found, construction should cease until the situation in the area of the find can
be evaluated.
