ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a 100% pedestrian
survey of a 15 acre tract of land in the city limits of Giddings, in south-central Lee
County, Texas on February 17, 1999. The area investigated is the site of the proposed
Simmang Park. No Federal agency was involved in this project that was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Committee permit number 2122. The project area was
investigated by shovel probing and backhoe trenching. One historic site (41LE201) was
recorded in the project area. This site is the remains of a demolished barracks that was
removed from Camp Swift in Bastrop County in the 1950s to be used as rental property.
It was condemned by the City and demolished circa 1994. This site is not significant,
and it is recommended that the City of Giddings be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Copies of the final report are on file at the Division of Archeology, Texas
Historical Commission and Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas;
the City of Giddings; and BVRA in Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Giddings proposes to construct an addition to an existing city park on
a 15 acre tract of land (Figure 1). The project area is bounded on the north by the
existing park, on the south by Washington Street, on the east by Ellis Street, and on the
west by private land. The project area is depicted on the Giddings topographic
quadrangle, dated 1958 and photorevised in 1988 (Figure 2). Proposed construction
consists of a fish pond, garden, trails, playscape area, parking lot, picnic pavilion,
covered sports court, little league practice field, swing sets, parking lots, volleyball court,
and swing sets. Hockel Branch, a tributary of Nails Creek, flows through the project
area (Figure 3).
Lee County contains numerous significant archaeological sites, both prehistoric
and historic, and the area has been the subject of several major cultural resources
investigations. Realizing the potential for sites within the proposed park area, the Texas
Historical Commission, Division of Archeology, requested an archaeological survey by a
professional archaeologist. In order to satisfy this requirement, the City of Giddings
retained BVRA to conduct the survey that was performed under antiquities permit 2122
and BVRA project number 99-04. William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator.
The following general discussion of Lee County was taken from the 1984-1985
Texas Almanac (Kingston and Harris 1983). Lee County is situated in the eastern part
of Central Texas and consists of 637 square miles, including areas under water.
Elevation in the county varies between 270 and 790 feet above sea level. Overall, the
topography is characterized as rolling, broken by Yegua Creek and its tributaries.
Annual rainfall varies from 35 to 88 inches. The January minimum temperature is 38
degrees and the July maximum temperature is 94 degrees. These climatic conditions
create a growing season of 273 days. According to Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996:Figure
1.1.9), Lee County is located in two modern plant communities, the Oak Woodlands and
Blackland Prairie. The current project area, based on the map in this volume, appears
to be situated within the Blackland Prairie.
There is no current soils book for Lee County. According to the local Soil
Conservation Service office (SCS) in Giddings, the soils in the original soils book are
now known to be incorrectly plotted, and the soils in the county are currently being
reassessed.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Central and
Southern Planning Region of Texas (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996:Figure 1.1.4), Lee
County is situated within the Central Texas archeological study region. In 1985,
according to a statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission
(Biesaart et al. 1985:159), Lee County contained 52 recorded sites. A check of the site
files at TARL revealed 200 recorded sites at the time of this survey. In 1985, no sites in
the county had been tested or excavated, and the majority of recorded prehistoric sites
are Late Prehistoric (n=17); 12 sites are listed as Archaic, and 1 is listed as Paleoindian
(Biesaart et al. 1985:159).
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Lee County, especially when numerous contract reports are available.
The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985), the
planning document published by the Texas Historical Commission (Mercado-Allinger et
al. 1996), and An archeological Bibliography for the Central Region of Texas (Simons
and Moore 1997) for more detailed information regarding Lee County. In the Central
Texas bibliography (Simons and Moore 1997:207), 76 studies in the county are listed.
Much of the previous work is related to oil and gas production such as pipelines and
well pads. The only reservoir study (Lake Somerville) was an investigation conducted in
the 1960s by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (Honea 1961). This study
located 11 prehistoric sites (41LE14- 41LE24), consisting of Archaic and Late
Prehistoric sites manifested mainly by lithic scatters.

FIELD METHODS
This project was performed using the 100% pedestrian survey method supported
by backhoe trenching. Selected areas were examined by shovel probes (n=5), and it
was determined that the project area could best be examined with a backhoe. Twelve
backhoe trenches (BT) were excavated across the project area, and it is believed that
the 15 acres were more than adequately sampled. Prior to commencing the field
survey, the site records at TARL were checked for the presence of previously recorded
archaeological sites in the project area and vicinity. Excavated matrix (a sample from
each bucket until clay was reached) from each backhoe trench was screened using 1/4
inch hardware cloth, and the data obtained were recorded in the field journal and on a
log (Appendix I). The location of the backhoe trenches were measured from a known
point with a 30 meter tape. These measurements were used to plot the approximate
location of the backhoe trenches on the project area map (Figure 2).
One historic site (41LE201) was found in the project area. Its location appears
on the project area map (Figure 2). The plotting of this site was obtained by measuring
the existing structure and fence line from the project area boundary and nearby
backhoe trenches. The site was assigned the temporary field number TS 1 (Temporary
Site), and a formal site number was assigned by TARL. Due to thick vegetation, no
photographs were taken of the site. Because of its recent age (20th century), no
artifacts were collected.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The site records at TARL yielded no previously recorded archaeological sites in
the project area. A review of the literature revealed that significant prehistoric and
historic sites are present in Lee County. There are three historic sites in the county
listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), all in Giddings. These are the
Schubert House, the Lee County Courthouse, and the Droemer Brickyard site. The only
site in the county that is listed as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) is the Lee
County Courthouse. This investigation examined 15 acres, and one historic site was
found. No evidence of a prehistoric site was observed.
Site 41LE201 is the remains of a military barracks building that was moved from
Camp Swift in Bastrop County, Texas by E. T. Simmang in the 1950s to be used as
rental property (personal communication from Mike Simmang to D. E. Sosa, April 1999).
This structure began to deteriorate in the 1980s and was condemned by the City of
Giddings. In the early 1990s (circa 1994) it was demolished by the City. According to
Mr. Sosa, the site area was rural in the 1950s, and indoor plumbing was not common;
therefore, the adjacent outhouse probably is part of this site. A wooden crib was
observed in the area, but no well or cistern was noted. Also, there are several fences
that partitioned gardens and animal pens. The site area is approximately 40 meters
north south by 70 meters east west. Today, there is only a small portion of the barracks
still standing, and it is in poor condition and partly burned. It contains various pieces of
furniture and other domestic items. Kinds of artifacts observed include modern bricks,
window glass, ceramic fragments, a tin feed trough, a porcelain bedpan, screw top
bottles, recent furniture, a rusted gas stove, sheets of tin, nails and bolts, and various
unidentified pieces of metal. There are several piles of rubble that were created when
the building was bulldozed. Site 41LE201 contains no historical significance and is not
eligible for NRHP or SAL consideration. No further work is recommended.
It is believed that the project area is a low probability area for prehistoric sites.
There is a higher hill to the west that is out of the floodplain, and it may contain
evidence of prehistoric activity (see Figure 3).

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Historic
site 41LE201 is not significant, and no further work is recommended. It is always
possible that archaeological sites are missed during any archaeological survey. Should
evidence of a prehistoric or historic site in the project area be discovered during
construction, all work should cease immediately. The Archeology Division, Texas
Historical Commission, should be notified so that this find can be evaluated before
continuing with this project.
