ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of five proposed well pads (each 300 x 300 feet in size),
6945 feet of pipeline, 1220 feet of electrical line, 4520 feet of telephone line, and 930 feet
of access road was conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates on November 9
and 10, 1996. This project was conducted for Famcor Oil, Inc. of Houston, Texas. The
project area is located in the Sam Houston National Forest, south-central San Jacinto
County, Texas. This investigation was performed using the pedestrian survey method
supported by shovel testing and probing. No prehistoric or historic sites were found.
Significant portions of the area examined were previously disturbed such as existing well
pads and portions of the lines followed existing roads and ditches. It is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed, as planned, and monitoring during construction by an
archaeologist is not considered necessary.

INTRODUCTION
Famcor Oil, Inc. of Houston, Texas plans to construct two new well pads (Famcor
#1 Foster [Sierra Prod. Co. #1 Foster] and Famcor #A-6 Foster), one access road (930
feet), six pipelines (6945 feet), one electrical line (1220 feet), and one telephone line
(4520 feet) in the Sam Houston National Forest, south-central San Jacinto County, Texas
(Figure 1). In addition, three existing well pad sites were examined. These are the
Famcor #2 Foster (Mossbacher #2 Foster), Famcor #D-2 Foster (Continental #2 Foster),
and Famcor #D-3 Foster (Jet Oil Producers #D3 Foster). Famcor #2 Foster and Famcor
D-2 Foster are proposed re-entry wells, and Famcor D-3 Foster is a current saltwater
disposal well. All five well pad sites are 300 x 300 feet in size, which includes the actual
well pad site area as well as a construction and use buffer. The project area is located in
the 2556 acre Foster Minerals lease that is part of the George Taylor survey (Abstract
292).
The project area is depicted on the 7.5' U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle
Coldspring dated 1960 and photorevised in 1976 (Figure 2). The U.T.M. coordinates for
the Central Tank Battery, the approximate center of the project area, are Northing 33 79
950 and Easting 2 94 700. This area is the property of the United States Forest Service,
United States Department of Agriculture and is administrated through the New Waverly
District office. Wally Kingsborough is the District Archaeologist, and John E. Ippolito is
the archaeologist for the Forest Service holdings in Texas.
The nearest permanent streams are Clear Creek to the north, Tarkington Bayou to
the east, and the East Fork of the San Jacinto River to the west. Tarkington Bayou and
Clear Creek are part of a larger drainage system created by the San Jacinto River. The
closest branch of the San Jacinto River is the East Fork which is approximately 1300
meters to the west of well pad #D2 Foster. Overall, the project area is situated within an
area containing numerous dry stream channels and sandy ridges. No natural springs are
known to exist in the current project area (Richard Hughart, personal communication,
November 11, 1996). Previous archaeological surveys in the vicinity of the current project
area have identified both prehistoric and historic sites, and the county contains several
significant archaeological sites. Therefore, an archaeological survey was required by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (S.H.P.O.), the lead review and compliance agency,
before construction is allowed to proceed. In order to satisfy this requirement, Famcor
Oil, Inc. contracted with Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) to perform this
service. The project number assigned by Brazos Valley Research Associates is BVRA
96-09. No permit from the Texas Antiquities Committee was required for this project.
The project area is part of the Coldspring Oil Field that has been the locus of
intensive oil and gas exploration. It is situated in the south-central portion of San Jacinto
County, south of Coldspring (the county seat) and north of the Liberty Hill Cemetery. The
main highway in the area is F.M. 2025 which runs north-south and, at one point, is
approximately 800 meters due east of the central tank battery.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coast Plain physiographic
province and the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:98-100). The
overstory vegetation is primarily large pines and hardwoods, while the understory
consists of various shrubs and forbs. A more detailed discussion of the environmental
setting for the Sam Houston National Forest is presented in Ippolito's (1983) thorough
overview of Texas National Forests. The surface geology is the Willis Formation which
consists of various sands and clays containing some small gravels. The reader is
referred to Volume I (Stratigraphy) of the Geology of Texas by Sellards et al. (1932) for a
more in-depth discussion of the geology of this area. In terms of their topographic setting,
the well pads are on sandy upland ridges and slopes overlooking Tarkington Bayou,
Clear Creek, the East Fork of the San Jacinto River, and the various tributaries of these
streams, while the access road, pipeline routes, electrical line, and telephone line cross
portions of these streams and low-lying areas as well as upland ridges and divides.
Soils
The project area is depicted in the soils book for San Jacinto County (McEwen et
al. 1988) on Sheet Number 75. Most of the project area is within Pinetucky fine sandy
loam (PfB), 1 to 5 percent slopes, while a small portion may be in Doucette loamy fine
sand, 1 to 5 percent slopes (DoB). Pinetucky fine sandy loam is a gently sloping soil
found on broad, smooth, upland plains (McEwen et al. 1988:37-38). This soil typically has
a fine sandy loam surface layer about 12 inches thick and a subsoil of yellowish-brown
sandy clay loam about 28 inches deep. Below this is a yellowish-brown sandy clay loam
with a depth of 56 inches This soil is moderately well drained and runoff is slow to
medium. Seasonal wetness and moderately slow permeability are seen as major
limitations to modern use including recreation.
Doucette loamy fine sand (McEwen et al. 1988:25-26) is a gently sloping soil on
upland ridges. Individual areas are irregularly shaped and range from 10 to about 2000
acres. Typically, this soil has a loamy fine sand surface layer about 22 inches thick. It is
dark grayish-brown in the upper part and grades to pale brown in the lower part. The
subsoil, to a depth of 70 inches, is sandy clay loam and grades into mottled strong brown,
yellowish-red and light brownish-gray in the lower part. This soil is well drained, but runoff
is slow.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Previous Investigations
San Jacinto County is located in the Southeast Texas region as defined by
Biesaart et al. (1985:76) in Prehistoric Archeological Sites in Texas: A Statistical
Overview published by the Office of the State Archeologist, Texas Historical Commission.
This is an area that was well documented in terms of numbers of sites in 1985 when
compared to other regions of Texas. When the statistical overview was compiled, a total
of 1630 prehistoric sites (8.06% of the state) was recorded in the entire region. Only four
of the thirteen regions in Texas reported more sites or had a higher percentage statewide.
Only two counties, Chambers (240) and Harris (300), had more recorded sites in 1985
(Biesaart et al. 1985:88). The 132 sites recorded in San Jacinto County in 1985 consisted
of 8.10% of the region and .65% of the state. The reader is referred to the overview for
additional statistical information concerning San Jacinto County and its relation to the rest
of Texas.
Although numerous archaeological investigations have been conducted in San
Jacinto County, the vast majority has been small area surveys, often resulting in negative
findings. Many of these investigations resulted from the demand placed on the landscape
by the oil and gas industry. A bibliography of the Southeastern Region of Texas by
William E. Moore (1989) contains a listing of all work done in San Jacinto County through
1989. In addition, an ongoing project sponsored by the Department of Antiquities
Protection, Texas Historical Commission, is engaged in abstracting contract reports by
year. To date, volumes have been published for 1987 (Moore 1991), 1988 (Moore
1990a), 1989 (Moore 1993a), 1990 (Moore 1992a), 1991 (Moore 1992b), and 1992
(Moore 1994a).
Two overviews of the archaeology of the National Forests of Texas have been
published. In 1979, Ross C. Fields (1979) prepared a report which discussed the cultural
resources of each forest. This was followed by Ippolito's (1983) more extensive work.
Ippolito's effort provides a comprehensive discussion of the archaeology of all four forests
and is the most recent and thorough review of the archaeology of the Texas national
forests available.
The first major archaeological investigation to be conducted in San Jacinto County
was survey and testing in the Livingston Reservoir. The initial survey was conducted in
1963 by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) and recorded sites within and
adjacent to the proposed lake. Most of the sites located were found to occur towards the
southeastern end of the lake. The results of the survey have been reported by Nunley
(1963).

5

Two of the sites found during the Lake Livingston survey in San Jacinto County
were tested in 1965. These were the Trichel site (41SJ16) excavated by TASP personnel
and the Houston site (41SJ19) excavated by members of the Houston Archeological
Society. Both sites have been classified as Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric in age based
on the presence of dart points, arrow points, and ceramics.
The only other prehistoric site to be excavated in San Jacinto County is the
Strawberry Hill site (41SJ160). This site was investigated by the Texas Highway
Department in 1974 (Keller and Weir 1979). Strawberry Hill yielded a large quantity of
artifacts but, according to the authors, produced little new information. It is described as a
multi-component site containing both Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials.
A historic contact period Indian site in San Jacinto County dating to the
mid-nineteenth century was excavated by Dick Ping Hsu (1969) through the combined
efforts of the Houston Archeological Society, science students of Coldspring High School,
the Texas Building Commission, and the Texas Water Development Board. Glass trade
beads and silver brooches had never been reported from this section of Texas, and the
presence of burials and other historic and native manufactured artifacts make this a very
significant site. It is hypothesized by Hsu (1969:47) that the "Alabama-Coushatta was
probably the group that buried their dead in this location."
It is beyond the scope of this negative findings report to discuss every
archaeological investigation in the Sam Houston National Forest. Several recent efforts,
however, are worthy of mention. These include three surveys of well pad sites in the
Mercy Oil Field in 1992 by James E. Corbin (1992) and Brazos Valley Research
Associates (Moore 1993b, 1994b) and two surveys in the Coldspring Oil Field by James
E. Corbin (1994) and Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore and Bradle 1996). The
1993 study by Brazos Valley Research Associates recorded prehistoric site 41SJ48, and
the 1994 study by Corbin recorded prehistoric site 41SJ49. The 1996 survey by Brazos
Valley Research Associates examined five well pads, one access road, a telephone line,
and one electrical line in the immediate vicinity of the current project area. No sites were
found, and it was determined that much of the area had been disturbed prior to this
investigation.
Most recently three major works have appeared which contain detailed overviews
relevant to Southeast Texas and the project area. These are Archeology in the Eastern
Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document by the Department of Antiquities
Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Roger G. Moore's (1995) Ph.D. dissertation
entitled The Mossy Grove Model of Long-Term Forager-Collector Adaptations in Inland
Southeast Texas, and Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society. The
latter reviews the current state of Archeology in Texas and contains a chapter devoted to
Southeast Texas (Patterson 1995).

Cultural Chronology
The cultural chronology of this part of Texas is, according to Story (1981), by no
means completely understood. Other researchers such as Aten (1983), Bement et al.
(1987), Bond and Moore (1980), Ippolito (1983), Keller and Weir (1979), Moore (1978,
1990b), Patterson (1979a, 1979b, 1979c, 1983, 1986, 1989), Shafer and Stearns (1975),
Shafer et al. (1975), Story (1974, 1981), Story et al. (1990), and Wheat and Gregg (1988)
have discussed the chronology of Southeast Texas and the Texas National Forests in
more detail, and the reader is advised to consult these sources for additional information.

FIELD METHODS
The project was divided into three phases - background and archival research,
field survey, and report preparation. The background and archival research consisted of
a check of the site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). This
task was performed by the Principal Investigator.
Background and Archival Research
A check of the site records at TARL was conducted to identify any previously
recorded sites, if any, in the project area. In order to better understand the nature of
previous archaeological work in the region, the archival research included a review of the
following documents: a statistical overview of Texas archaeology prepared by the Texas
Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985), an overview of the National Forests in Texas
by Forest Service Archeologist, John E. Ippolito (1983) a bibliography of Southeast Texas
(Moore 1989), several contract reports documenting work in the Sam Houston National
Forest (Moore 1993b, 1994b), and a series of reports containing abstracts for Texas
contract archaeology (Moore 1990a, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1993a, 1994a).
Field Investigation
The field investigation was conducted on November 9 and 10, 1996. Michael R.
Bradle was the Project Archaeologist. He supervised the fieldwork with assistance from
Dwight R. Cropper. A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted across the entire project
area. Shovel tests were excavated at each of the well pads and along the pipeline routes,
access road, electrical line, and telephone line. A minimum of four tests were dug at each
well pad site (Table 1). The remaining tests were dug throughout the rest of the project
area. In all, 29 shovel tests and 15 shovel probes were dug. Excavated matrix was
screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Shovel test data were recorded on a shovel
test log (Appendix I) and in the field notes. Tests were dug until clay was encountered.
Depths of the tests varied from 5 to 74 centimeters below the ground surface, and the
average depth was calculated at 35.03 centimeters. In addition to the shovel testing, all
exposed areas in the project area were inspected for cultural materials. No artifacts were
collected during the course of this investigation.
Report Preparation
This task was performed inhouse by the Principal Investigator and Project
Archaeologist. A draft report was prepared for review by the Department of Antiquities
Protection, Texas Historical Commission; the United States Forest Service; and Famcor
Oil, Inc. A copy of the report, all notes, shovel test forms, and other records are on file at
Brazos Valley Research Associates.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
This survey did not locate any prehistoric or historic sites within the project area.
Much of the area surveyed had been previously disturbed through logging, gravel
quarrying, and previous well and access road construction. The mining of gravel in this
area appears to be extensive based on the presence of at least five gravel pits on the
section of the topographic quadrangle surrounding the project area.
Although portions of the project area appears, based on the topographic map, to
be likely settings for prehistoric sites, the lack of such sites could be, in part, due to the
shallow, moderately well drained soils with slow to medium runoff (see Environmental
Setting above). The archival research conducted for this and other projects in the Sam
Houston National Forest indicates that prehistoric sites in the area are typically found on
landforms with deep well-drained sandy soils such as 41SJ48 south of the current project
area, located by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore 1993b), and 41SJ49 west of
the project area on a sandy ridge above the floodplain of the East Fork of the San Jacinto
River located by Corbin (1994). Site 41SJ48 is on a sandy ridge in Splendora very fine
sandy loam (SpA) as defined by McEwen et al. 1988:11), and site 41SJ49 is believed by
Corbin to be in Doucette loamy fine sand (DoB). Both site areas contained sandy loam to
depths of at least 90 centimeters.
An apparent lack of a permanent water source in part of the project area is viewed
as a major reason for the absence of sites in the area surveyed. The combination of an
absence of natural springs in the area, as stated by Mr. Hughart, and the fact that much of
this area is drained by intermittent streams that contain only seasonal flow should be
considered. It should also be noted that much of the area examined was in topographical
settings not typically utilized by prehistoric groups and that, should sites exist, the chance
of in situ deposits is low given the amount of previous disturbance.

10

RECOMMENDATIONS
No significant cultural resources were found during the archaeological survey
documented in this report. It is, therefore, recommended that Famcor Oil, Inc. be allowed
to proceed with construction as planned. The presence of an archaeologist to act as
monitor during the construction phase is not considered necessary. There is always the
possibility that cultural materials or features are missed during the course of any
archaeological survey. Should the presence of cultural materials not discussed in this
report be discovered during construction, the client is advised to cease work and contact
the State Historic Preservation Officer immediately. In addition, the Forest Service
archaeologist should be advised of the situation.
