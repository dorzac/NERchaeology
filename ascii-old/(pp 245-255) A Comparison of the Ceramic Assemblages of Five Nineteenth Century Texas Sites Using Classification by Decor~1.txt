A Comparison of the Ceramic Assemblages
of Five Nineteenth Century Texas Sites
Using Classification by Decoration
Joan Few
ABSTRACT
A revolution took place in the English ceramics industry in the latter part
of the eighteenth century. New ceramic technology and mass production
brought uniformity in ware manufacturing, making eighteenth centruy ware
type classifications of paste and glaze impractical for nineteenth century ceramics. This revolution led to the nineteenth century practice of describing and
marketing ceramics by type of decoration. The ceramic assemblages of five
nineteenth century historic sites in Texas, selected for the amount of excavation
and documented time of nineteenth century occupation, have been divided
according to decoration for site comparisons. All but 18 of the 2,769 sherds
from these five sites could be classified by decoration. The seven decorative
categories proposed herein are a valid taxonomic system for nineteenth century
ceramics. Classification of nineteenth century ceramics by decoration makes
identification easier than by the ware type method. It encourages site and
assemblage comparisons and may prove also to be an indicator of economic
status.
INTRODUCTION

George L. Miller (1980) has proposed that ceramics from nineteenth
century sites should be compared by the characteristics that were primary for the
people who used them--by decoration rather than ware types. The most obvious advantage of this method is that it provides a more consistent system than
one based on ware types, where there may be considerable variation in nomenclature. Classification by decoration facilitates the correlation of historical data
with archeological data. This paper compares the ceramic assemblages of five
nineteenth century Texas home sites by the decoration system. It is hoped that
such a system will encourage questions about such traits as behavior, behavioral
patterns, cultural process, economic status, ethnic identification, ceramic availability, site dating, and trade patterns in order to give direction to site comparisons and maximum use of ceramics in the study of historic sites.
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
The first step in ceramic analysis is classification. The question being
addressed here is which taxonomic system to use for classifying nineteenth
century ceramics. The system called ware types that has been used by historical

archeologists is based on classification by paste and glaze, which, for ceramics
made before the nineteenth century were easily identifiable. There was some
confusion in nomenclature and classification of ware types, but it was adequate
until a revolution took place in the English ceramics industry in the later part of
the eighteenth century, making classification of ware types impractical for
nineteenth century ceramics.
The technological changes in the ceramics industry in England that brought
about ceramic uniformity have been described by George L. Miller (1980:1).
In the second half of the 18th century, a revolution took place in the
English ceramic industry. This period saw the introduction of transfer
printing, calcinated flint, liquid glazes, Cornish clays, calcinated bone, canals
for transporting raw materials and finished products into and out of the potteries, steam power for working clay and pottery, tariffs against Chinese porcelain, favorable trade treaties with the Continent, and astute marketing of creamware which culminated in English domination of the world ceramic tableware
trade by the 1790s.

Creamware displaced the ware types that were distinguishable by their
unique pastes and glazes and was the forerunner of the nineteenth century
pearlwares, stone chinas, ironstones, and whitewares. Miller contends that the
table-, tea-, and toiletware assemblages from the nineteenth century consist
almost entirely of these nineteenth century types, which are difficult to distinguish by paste and glaze. This led to the nineteenth century practice of describing and marketing ceramics by their type of decoration, and ware types became
less important (Miller 1980:1-3).
Archeologists who attempt to classify nineteenth century ceramics by eighteenth century ware types run into problems of nomenclature, identification,
chronological sequence, integration with historical documents, and correlation
with social status information. In "An Analysis of Historical Ceramics from the
Central Salt River Valley of Northeast Missouri," Teresita Majewski and
Michael J. OâBrien discuss the problems faced in trying to use a ware type
classification system for nineteenth century ceramics. They urge the adoption
of a classification system based on decoration as more reflective of historical
reality (Majewski and OâBrien 1984:19-25).
In an effort to solve this nineteenth century classification problem, George
Miller (1980) has proposed a system for looking at ceramics by decoration and
cost. Miller states that the social status of any commodity is related to how
much the object costs, and prices for pottery were determined by how they were
decorated. The Staffordshire potters had a series of price-fixing agreements in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and from these documents Miller has
culled the classifications and prices set by the potters for their products. Miller
has classified nineteenth century ceramics into four groups based on decoration
and cost.
Category one consists of the cheapest undecorated white ceramics. Sometimes referred to as CC ware, common wares, white earthen ware, earthen ware,

Few ~ Comparisons of Ceramic Assemblages

and stone china, these wares mostly chamber pots, plates, bowls, and items
related to kitchen use. Category two includes those wares with minimal decoration, such as shell edges, sponge-decorated, banded, mocha, and common cable
(finger-trailed slip). These decorations were applied by workers of little skill
and were priced only slightly higher than the undecorated wares. Category three
is made up of painted wares with motifs such as flowers, leaves, stylized
Chinese landscapes, and geometric patterns. A worker needed enough skill to
duplicate apattern well enough to make a set. According to Miller (1980), most
of the painted wares found in North American sites bear simple stylized motifs
that required minimal artistic skills and were almost always cheaper than transfer-printed vessels. Category four consists of transfer prints, one of the great
English innovations in decorated ceramics. Underglazed transfer printing was a
common method of decorating ceramics by the 1790s. When first introduced,
transfer prints brought as much as five times the price of undecorated wares, but
dropped to about double the price of undecorated wares by the middle of the
nineteenth century; the willow pattern was the cheapest transfer printed pattern.
In the early nineteenth century, a flow-blue pattern of transfer-printed wares was
introduced that sold for a higher price than the regular transfer prints. Miller
intentionally left porcelain out of this classification because of a lack of pricing
information (Miller 1980:2-4).
Millerâs four-category system is not adequate for the study of ceramics in
nineteenth century sites in Texas. In order to use Millerâs system as an indicator
of economic status based on price, one must assume that the consumer had
access to ceramic wares in all price ranges and selected according to his economic capability. Texans in the nineteenth century were limited in their selection of ceramics by patterns of commercial distribution and availability in the
frontier and rural regions. Millerâs classification is not directed toward function,
behavior, or process, and it does not include all ceramic types found in Texas. It
works as a cost indicator only until 1850, for in the 1850s a white granite, or
undecorated white ironstone, flooded the market, and this new type of undecorated ware was priced the same as the transfer printed wares (Miller 1980:4).
This new undecorated ware seems to have replaced the transfer prints in the
markets, weakening the cost-to-decoration relationship. In view of these problems there is reason to question the use of Millerâs system. However, he
contends that his four categories account for most of the table-, kitchen-, and
toiletwares recovered from North American sites during the nineteenth century
(Miller 1980:4), and his categories divide ceramics into distinctive groups based
on design, decoration, skill, and technology. By adding three more categories-porcelain, colored wares (colored glaze over surface), and stoneware--we have
a valid system for classification of most of the nineteenth century ceramic types
found in Texas.
Comparisons of Ceramic Assemblages in Texas
The ceramic assemblages of five historic sites in Texas have been subdivided according to decoration for the purpose of site comparisons. The sites

248

(see Figure 1) were selected for this comparison based on the amount of excavation accomplished at each site and the length of time they were occupied during
the nineteenth century. At all five sites, enough excavations had been accomplished to assure a representative sampling of the various types of ceramics used
at each site.

in this report.
The Adolphus Sterne home in Nacogdoches (41NA144), was excavated by
a crew from Stephen F. Austin State University under the direction of James E.
Corbin, with the assistance of Deborah C. Kisling. This ceramic count is from
the excavation report published in 1983 and does not include work done at the
site during the TAS Field School in the summer of 1985. Sterne built his home in
1828 at the age of 27. He was a prosperous merchant, planter, postmaster, and
land agent. "The Sterne home also was a focal point in the social, political, and
economic life of Nacogdoches" (Corbin and Kisling 1983:51). Sterne should be
ranked in an upper economic bracket with the ability to purchase available
material goods.
Post West Bernard (41WH16) was occupied between 1837 and 1839. This
site was a storage depot for artillery and heavy camp equipment of The Army of
The Republic of Texas. Situated in northeastern Wharton County on the west
bank of the West Bernard River, the site was found during a survey for aboriginal sites by Joe D. Hudgins and excavated by the Houston Archeological Society
(Hudgins 1987). Analysis by Alton Briggs (1983) showed that the ceramics-remnants of cups, bowls, and plates--appear to be British in origin.
The Eagle Island Plantation Site B in Lake Jackson, Texas was excavated
by the Brazosport Archeological Society under the direction of Johnney Pollan

The Eagle Island Plantation Site B in Lake Jackson, Texas was excavated
by the Brazosport Archeological Society under the direction of Johnney Pollan
and James Smith. The site report has not been published, but Pollan and Smith
have graciously allowed the use of their ceramic counts in this paper. The site
comprises a structure on a major nineteenth century road that may have been the
home of the plantation overseer. The main house of the plantation has been
identified and is about half a mile from Site B. The house foundation at Site B is
of mortared brick, capable of supporting two stories. This structure, together
with artifacts, was destroyed by a storm in 1900. The ceramics were identified
by Anne Fox and Johnney Pollan.
The Richard Carter site (41BZ74) was excavated by the Archeological
Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University, under the direction of Shawn
Carlson. Archeological and historic investigations suggest that Carter, who had
a land grant of one league in the Stephen F. Austin colony, was in the upper
economic bracket in Brazos County. Carterâs wealth appears to have been in
land, slaves, and in a cattle herd of 1,000 in 1860. Carter built a one room log
cabin in 1841; the lack of architectural artifacts at the site suggests that a more
modern structure never was built on the site (Carlson 1983).
The Glorianna plantation (41JP94) in Jasper County was excavated by
members of the Houston Archeological Society and The Texas Archeological
Society. Historic records indicate that the plantation was established in the
1850s and, after the civil war, was occupied as a homestead until the 1880s. In
the 1860 census, William Norsworthy is listed with his wife, seven children, and
thirty slaves. He claimed land valued at $17,000. and personal assets of $6,000.
The average value of land owned in Jasper County in 1860 was $2,700., and the
average personal wealth was $4,555. These figures indicate that the Norsworthys were in an upper economic bracket (Few 1986).
The ceramic assemblages (including surface collections) from these sites
should reflect ceramic stylistic changes that took place in the nineteenth century.
Sites occupied before 1850 should have higher percentages of transfer-printed
wares than those occupied after 1850. Sites settled after 1850 should have high
percentages of white undecorated wares. The categories suggested here for use
on nineteenth century historic sites in Texas are (1) Uncolored whitewares, (2)
Minimally decorated, usually around the edge, (3) Hand painted, (4) Transferprinted, (5) Porcelain, translucent glaze, (6) Colored ceramics, colored glaze,
and (7) Stonewares, highly fired earthenwares that hold water without glazing
(Figure 2). (See Appendix for more complete descriptions of these categories.)
DISCUSSION
Since all but 18 of the 2,769 ceramic sherds in this comparative study could
be classified by decoration, the seven decorative categories proposed here are a
valid system for classification of nineteenth century ceramics (see Figure 2).
Comparisons of these sites (Table 1) show that the difference between sites
occupied before and after 1850 reflects the changes in ceramic technology that

took place around 1850. There is a definite change in the proportions of decorated wares (with applied color) to undecorated wares (white, devoid of color).
Classification by decoration does make identification easier. It should encourage comparisons among sites and assemblages, and it may prove to be an
indicator of economic status and period. High economic status in nineteenth
century Texas probably will be reflected in complete sets of dishes and other
expensive items such as transfer-printed soup tureens and porcelain tea sets.
Establishment of a ceramic classification system based on decoration is
only the first step toward complete ceramic analysis. Total analysis should
include both the functional analysis of ceramic sherds (Few 1987) and analysis
of spatial relationships between ceramics and other artifacts denoting behavior
and process, the inter- and intraregional comparisons of ceramics, the analysis
of behavioral processes, and trade throughout the state. Sites must be excavated
in such a manner that assemblages accurately reflect all types of ceramics used
and in their proper proportions to other artifacts. Ceramic functions correlated
with the overall patterns of sites will identify human behavior and cultural
process. "Once pattern is abstracted and synthesized with other patterns, these
demonstrated regularities are often expressed as empirical laws. The explanation of why these lawlike regularities exist is the goal of archeology" (South
1977:xiii).

APPENDIX
Seven Decorative Classifications for Nineteenth Century Ceramics
1. Uncolored Whitewares (Figure 2, a, b)

Description: Vessels are white, devoid of color; may have raised designs
or scalloped edges; were commonly tablewares, chamber pots, and items related
to kitchen use.
Common Names: Creamwear, "CC", Common, White Earthenware, Earthenware, Ironstone, Stone China, White Granite, etc. (Miller 1980:3).
2. Minimal decoration (Figure 2, d-h)

Description: White vessels with color usually found on the rim; may have
stripes or color along the edge; sponges sometimes used to apply color around
the rim or covering the plate; designs required minimal artistic skills.
Common Names: Shell Edge, Sponge-Decorated, Banded (Figure 2, c, d),
Mocha, Common Cable, etc. (Miller 1980:4).
Shell Edge (Figure 2, e-g) involved a series of short brush strokes along the
rim. In the 1840s and 1850s molding was added to the shell edge design and
color was applied parallel to the rim, the molding lending an effect to the edge
(Miller 1980:4). Shell edge colors were usually blue or green (Majewski 1984:
33).
Sponge or Spatter decoration (Figure 2, h) was applied to the border,
center, or entire vessel. The spatter effect was produced by tapping a brush full
of paint against the vessel being decorated. The sponge process was achieved
when a color-filled sponge was pressed on the vessel. Cut-sponges resembled
stars, flowers, angels, eagles and other forms (Majewski 1984:44).

3. Hand Painted Wares (Figure 2, i-m)
Description: Vessels were hand painted with decorations of flowers, leaves,
stylized Chinese landscapes, or geometric patterns; transfer prints sometimes
used to outline the colored areas (Miller 1980:4); colors used included blue,
brownish green, tan, orange, yellow, black, red, pink, and rust. A typical design
included leaves, stylized red and blue flowers, or berries (Majewski 1984:41).
Dating Information:
Popular between 1810 and 1860 (Majewski 1984:41).
4. Transfer Printing (Figure 2, n-p)
Description: A method of decorating ceramics where a design is engraved
on a copper plate and transferred by way of tissue paper onto the vessel before
glazing (Gaston 1983:158); blue was the first color used in this process; flow
Blue is a process by which the color of the printing was allowed to flow into the
glaze creating a blurred or misty look; deep blue was the most popular, but
mulberry, black, yellow, brown, and green were also used (Majewski 1984:33).
The Blue Willow pattern has many variations, but three major components-the willow tree, the orange tree, and the tea house, all of which relate to
Oriental culture (Gaston 1983:6).
Dating Information:
Transfer printing developed in 1750 (Majewski 1984:33).
Common by 1790 (Miller 1980).
Blue Willow Pattern:1780 (Majewski 1984:33 and Gaston 1983:7).
Multicolor transfer prints by 1840 (Majewski 1984:33).
Colors: 1750s- blue; 1828- green, yellow, red, black; 1830- brown,
pink, lavender, orange, grey, and light blue.

1830-1860, purple (lavender); 1840-1860, flow transfer prints (Majewski 1984:33-34).
5. Porcelain (Figure 2, q-s)

Porcelain paste is a combination of kaolin clay, ball clay, feldspar and flint.
The glaze combines kaolin, flint, feldspar, and limestone. Porcelains are fired at
temperatures of as much as 2670Â° F, much higher than other ceramics (Nelson
1960). Porcelains are translucent as opposed to earthenwares, which are opaque
(Godden 1964:739). Porcelain rarely occurs undecorated (Miller 1980:4).
Tips for identification: Porcelain, compared to a white stoneware, usually
will be whiter, thinner, and lighter, and have a harder glaze that will be less
likely to crack. If broken, 1 or 2 mm of the edge will be translucent.
6. Colored Ceramics (Figure 2, t-x)
Description: Vessels are completely, or almost completely, covered with a
colored glaze; vessels may be tablewares, vases, doorstops, and candlesticks.
Rockingham slip-glaze (Figure 2, t) is achieved by spattering or dripping a
rich tan or dark brown color over a white, buff, or yellow paste ware. Rockingham was produced throughout the nineteenth century (Majewski 1984:45).
Fiesta-like wares should be included in this category.
English Majolica (an imitation of Italian Majolica, Figure 2, u), developed
about 1850 and decorated with a wide range of semitranslucent colored glazes;
made in a variety of shapes, it was often decorated with plant or tree motifs
(Lewis 1981:135).
7. Stoneware (Figure 2, v-x)

Description: "A hard, highly fired variety of earthenware, normally holding water without the need for glazing" (Godden 1964:739). Sometimes referred to as crockery (for a complete description, see Greer 1981); generally
used in food preserving and processing; preserve jars, lard jars, chums, milk
bowls, butter pots, etc. Colors are grays, tans, and browns.
