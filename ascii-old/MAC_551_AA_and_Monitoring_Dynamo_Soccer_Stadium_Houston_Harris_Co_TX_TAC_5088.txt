ABSTRACT
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., Houston, Texas, conducted both a documentary-based
land use study and a limited field investigation at the site of a proposed Dynamo Professional
Soccer team stadium within the eastern portion of the Central Business District of the City of
Houston, Texas. The historical and field investigations were conducted intermittently between
September, 2008 and January, 2009 by Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC), Houston,
Texas, for Weston Solutions, Inc., and the City of Houston. The investigation was performed to
assist the City of Houston in meeting its cultural resources management obligations under Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Texas Antiquities
Code (Permit No. 5088). This report presents the results of these two initial phases of cultural
resource studies for the proposed project: an initial documentary research and archeological
assessment to predict archeological site potential, conducted concurrently with archeological
monitoring of the remaining commercial structures on the tract.
The area investigated is six city blocks designated on the City of Houston plat as Blocks 203,
204, 205, 218, 219, and 220, South Side, Buffalo Bayou, as well as the streets encompassed
therein. Between the months of November 2008 and January 2009 MAC monitored demolitions
occurring within the Project Area under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5088. The tract at the
beginning of this investigation was mostly vacant, exhibiting bare earth, concrete slabs of a few
previously demolished buildings, and a few remaining commercial structures. The blocks,
including the enclosed street areas, measure approximately 14.5 acres. The area of potential
construction covers the entire six block tract, and all buildings and slabs had been removed to
grade by the end of the demolition program. No features or other potentially significant
archeological deposits were disturbed by the demolition, though observations of concrete pier
removal within one building confirmed that intact deposits were present outside the area of the
pier disturbances.
The documentary evidence and the results of the archeological monitoring both support the twin
assertions that significant archeological deposits and features may have been present within the
Dynamo Stadium Project Area, and that the prospect for the survival of these deposits is good. It
is not likely, based on this current evidence, that archeological investigations in the area will yield
information on Native American occupations, or on the first 50 years Houston’s development.
Remains within the area may, however, allow us to propose equally interesting – and henceforth
little examined – questions regarding neighborhood commerce and racial relations in the older,
but still young, City of Houston.
The prospect of examining the material remains of Anglos and persons of color living adjacent to
each other is especially intriguing, since the graphic and historical data indicates that they were
living in proximity as neighbors on a superficially equal footing, rather than in a ‘master-servant’
relationship such as that examined at Ashton Villa in Galveston before and after the Civil War.
The Project Area may therefore provide interesting new information on broadly domestic
relations prior to (or as an alternative to) the strict segregation of the first half of the Twentieth
Century,
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., recommends the selection of sample areas within the sixblock tract for archeological examination by mechanically assisted Subsurface Survey. This
survey methodology, involving both mechanical trenching and the stripping of disturbed deposits
from block areas believed to contain important remains, is a very effective, cost efficient, and

ii

practical means to determine the presence or absence of significant remains within an urban tract
such as the current Project Area.

INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of an initial archeological and historical
investigation at the site of a proposed Houston Dynamos professional soccer stadium
within the eastern portion of the Central Business District of the City of Houston, Texas
(Figure 1). The historical and field investigations were conducted intermittently between
September, 2008 and January, 2009 by Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC),
Houston, Texas, for Weston Solutions, Inc., and the City of Houston. The investigation
was performed to assist the City of Houston in meeting its cultural resources management
obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, and the Texas Antiquities Code (Permit No. 5088).
The area investigated is shown in Figure 2. It consists of six city blocks
designated on the City of Houston plat as Blocks 203, 204, 205, 218, 219, and 220, South
Side, Buffalo Bayou, as well as the streets encompassed therein. These blocks will
comprise the proposed Houston Dynamos Soccer Stadium. The tract at the beginning of
this investigation was mostly vacant, exhibiting bare earth, concrete slabs of a few
previously demolished buildings, and a few remaining commercial structures. The
blocks, including the enclosed street areas, measure approximately 14.5 acres. The area
of potential construction covers the entire six block tract.
This report presents two initial phases of cultural resource studies for the
proposed project: an initial documentary research and archeological assessment to predict
archeological site potential, conducted concurrently with archeological monitoring of the
remaining commercial structures on the tract. The fieldwork for these first two phases
was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5088, and the results of both phases
are presented herein.
The first major phase of investigation included a largely map and city directory
based historical land-use study directed towards identifying the locations of potentially
significant archeological deposits and features across the Project Area, and assessing the
potential of these remains to retain archeological integrity through limited modern
disturbance.1 This documentary research will show that portions of the Project Area have
the capacity to yield significant archeological deposits relating to the settlement and
development of the area. Further, many of the structures depicted on historic and modern
maps and aerial photographs are of frame, brick or slab construction, building types that
do not tend to be associated with extensive ground disturbance. A program of monitoring
well drilling was proposed for the site. Soil core data analysis was therefore originally
1

‘Significant’ historical remains, in current definition and practice by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission, consist of well-preserved archeological deposits or features of early, but not arbitrarily defined, date.
Formal archeological significance of these remains (especially for those dating from 1865 to the end of the first quarter
of the Twentieth Century) can derive from their association with poorly documented ethnic groups, events, social
movements, and the like, at the discretion of the Archeology Division.

yet been authorized, and the boring log data is not available at this time.

The second phase of investigation consisted of archeological monitoring of the
demolition of the remaining commercial structures within the Project Area. Demolition
of the remaining buildings, previously determined not to be National Register eligible or
otherwise historical in character was proposed as a prelude to construction of the
proposed stadium. This monitoring investigation proposed to utilize the building
demolition, slab removal, and soils borings2 as opportunities to view soil surfaces and
perhaps limited profile exposures. This information could inform and refine development
of the formal Subsurface Survey of the property that was presumed to follow under a
separate Antiquities Permit. Most of the buildings scattered across the tract are relatively
modern metal structures built on slabs. There were three masonry structures that we
expected to have more substantial subsurface components, but their demolition was
considered unlikely to affect many deposits that have not already been disturbed.
However, a professional archeological monitor was present during foundation demolition
to ensure that sensitive deposits were not disturbed. Detailed discussions of the
investigation and its results are presented in the following chapters.

CHAPTER II
DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

Introduction
The desktop research investigation seeks to provide evidence of initial occupation
within the footprint of the proposed Project and at least generically identify historic
occupants potentially associated with any archeological features exposed by the
subsequent Subsurface Survey stage investigations. Potentially significant archeological
remains which might conceivably occur within the project area fall into two broad
classes: (1) prehistoric (i.e., Indian) archeological deposits and features and, (2)
historical-period archeological deposits and features relating to the settlement and
development of the City of Houston. Prehistoric remains are unlikely to occur at this
location distant from Buffalo Bayou, since proximity to a natural source of water was a
major controlling factor in prehistoric site location. ‘Significant’ historical remains, in
current practice by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, consist
of well-preserved archeological deposits dating generally to the Nineteenth Century or
earlier, and/or those remains associated with community-based issues and interests such
as early Hispanic or African-American occupation and commerce, working class
populations and the factories that employed them, etc.
It is advisable on a project of this scale to devise a means of differentiating in
advance of field archeological investigations those subdivisions of the Project Area with
significant archeological potential from those of negligible potential.
These
identifications may permit the restriction of extensive archeological field efforts to only
those subdivisions of the Project Area with verifiable archeological potential, resulting in
significant cost and time savings.
The documentary data evaluates the archeological potential of each definable land
use subdivision of the Project Area and helps to determine the extent of field
investigations within each subdivision at the subsequent Subsurface Survey stage.
Extensive field investigations would be recommended for an individual subdivision only
if its occupation meets the aforementioned criteria for significance. Thus, a result of the
documentary investigations may be a reduction of the total percentage of the Project Area
which is subjected to mechanical soil stripping during the Subsurface Survey stage of
archeological investigations.
The archeological classification analysis encompasses the following elements:
(1) the previously discussed identification of subdivisions of the Project Area with
occupations meeting the criteria for significance based on the outcome of the desktop
research investigation (2) compilation and analysis of post-1925 ground surface
disturbances to the tract; (3) integration of the historic land use and previous disturbance
data to produce a lot-by-lot evaluation of the subsurface prehistoric and historic

5

archeological potential of the tract; and, (4) the transmission of the collected data,
interpretations, and recommendations to the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission.
This Investigator has benefited from first-hand exposure to the archeological
utility (or lack thereof) of many classes of document-based information through all the
stages of the historic and urban archeological project3 process. I have concluded from
these experiences that extremely detailed documentary studies (such as full land title and
tax record investigations) on the “front end” of archeological projects like the proposed
Dynamo Stadium are of extremely high cost and dubious actual value, especially when
many of the the tracts in question were occupied by renters and belonged to poorly
documented segments of Houston society. This is not to say that such detailed
investigations are never appropriate, even for projects where other, infinitely more
accessible sources of information that are more efficiently employed in the early phases
of a project. However, this tedious and expensive research is best confined to parcels that
have produced significant archeological remains at the survey level and beyond. I
believe that there are alternative avenues for documentary-based investigation that are
simple, effective, and cost-efficient for the early stages of urban and historical
archeological projects. I have selected one such methodology, centered on Geographical
Information System (GIS) organized study of historical maps and aerial photographs, as
particularly suitable to the current project objectives.
Project-Specific Methodology
Perhaps the most exciting and innovative element of current urban landscape
studies derives from the extensive collection and use of historic maps in the generation of
the impact-oriented predictive models for historic-period archeological site location.
Extensive electronic file versions of historic maps may be found through intensive
searches of Internet map resource sites. However, the utilization of these maps is not
restricted to the simple collection and subjective comparison with modern maps.
Geographic analysis programs include a function permitting the georeferencing of map
images over base maps with real-world accuracy through a process commonly referred to
as “rubber-sheeting.” This process involves first the selection of two or more fixed
geographic points common to both maps. These fixed points are often provided by
geographical coordinate system intersections (such as latitude and longitude) or by
geographic landmarks common to both maps. These common landmarks, for example
major street intersections, must be locations that have not changed position since the city
under study was originally platted. Once such common points have been selected, the
program processes this data and accurately as possible4 overlays the historic map upon
the modern base map.

3

i.e., from initial assessment to subsurface survey and testing through the completion of data recovery
excavations.
4
The accuracy of the overlay is also dependent on the general accuracy of the historic map. Most of the
maps examined for the Dynamo Stadium are professionally produced using ‘modern’ instruments and
methods, so the accuracy of the overlays can be expected to be generally high.

6

Once each historic map is georeferenced, the next step can be to create “draw
layers” of cultural and natural features existing at the date of each map’s creation. These
draw layers can be points (e.g., individual structure locations), lines (e.g., stream channel
configuration at the time of map production), or areas (e.g., outlying lots, marshy areas,
etc.). The draw layers can then be exported to modern base maps to depict their location
in the current landscape. These draw layers provide information directly relevant to both
prehistoric and historic site prediction. There were, for example, a number of large
(Buffalo and White Oak bayous) and small streams or gullies that existed within the core
area of the City of Houston. Buffalo Bayou has been encroached upon and confined in
downtown, while White Oak Bayou has been rechanneled. Meanwhile, some of the
small water features were, over time, filled in to the extent that no trace of their existence
remains on the current land surface. Proximity to water has been cited as a key element
of the southeast Texas prehistoric predictive model for site location. These lost water
bodies, where formerly present, doubtlessly influenced prehistoric settlement within the
core area of the City. The depiction of high-probability areas for prehistoric settlement
from a map-based study within urban Houston therefore takes into account the former
locations of these streams and marshes.
The evidence of Nineteenth Century historic settlement in a study area can be
more direct. Such evidence can take the form of depictions of locations of the core area
of in-filled urban settlement, historic roads, farm fields and out-lots, piers, railroad lines,
fortifications, and even individual structures. These mapped cultural features combine to
identify the high and moderate potential5 areas for historic archeological resources across
the landscape under study. Comparison of georeferenced maps from year to year also
enables the creation of draw layers that depict landscape changes through time. The
latter changes importantly include the intrusion of archeologically destructive actions
such as the construction of large buildings with basements.
For this general methodology to be useful it is necessary that one has access to
historical maps or aerial photographs of the city or area under study. It is fortunate and
efficient in the case of the Dynamo Stadium project that this investigator has collected a
relatively large number of accurate maps of Houston in the Nineteenth and Twentieth
centuries. MAC, moreover, has been using these maps to develop regional GIS databases
by the techniques described above for more than ten years.
The number of draw layers created from each historic map depends upon 1) the
number of cultural and natural features illustrated in each map, and 2) the overall
accuracy and resolution of the map. The value of each georeferenced map can vary
significantly due to two factors, 1) the accuracy of the initial map and 2) the electronic
resolution of the scanned image. For example, some maps have been scanned at
relatively low resolution, or represent few cultural features. As such they are useful only
for deriving a rough approximation of the terrain at the time the map was created.
5

Archeological potential should be distinguished from archeological probability. The latter (at least as I
apply it) weighs archeological potential against post Nineteenth Century disturbances to determine areas
where there is higher probability that archeological remains will be both present and preserved from postdepositional destruction.

7

Others, in contrast, can be high-resolution images of maps depicting a variety of relevant
natural and cultural features.
The final map-making exercise in the locational analysis process brings together
and integrates the information derived from the georeferenced historical maps as well as
the plots of disturbances and other observations made from Twentieth Century editions of
modern quadrangle maps and aerial photographs. These elements are combined to create
GIS Predictive Model Maps. Such maps achieve two objectives: 1) they distill into a
single, convenient map all the informative draw layers created from analysis of the
individual georeferenced historical maps, and 2) they combine information from these
informative historical draw layers with modern soil disturbance data to create Cultural
Resource Probability Zone mapping for prehistoric and historic cultural resources.
Post-depositional disturbances of the Dynamo Stadium Project Area have been
identified graphically6 by examination of Twentieth Century quadrangle and Sanborn
Fire Insurance maps, as well as aerial photographs. Plotted draw layers identifying those
disturbances include potentially intrusive buildings and former rail alignments. Both
these constructions could be destructive to the archeological record, though the impact of
large building foundations is generally deeper and more extensive than that of rail lines.
The cumulative “Historic Structures” draw layers are next plotted against the draw layers
representing post-depositional disturbance. Locations where historic buildings once
stood that do not fall within the impact footprint of the later disturbances define the areas
of higher archeological probability for historic-period remains. Areas of low to moderate
probability are simply defined as the remainder of the Dynamo Stadium Project Area.
The image- and map-based analyses presented herein were productively enhanced
by being tied to Houston City Directory information on occupancy of the Project Area
blocks over a period of 110 years (1894-2004). These directories provided invaluable
information on the identity and ethnicity of area residents, as well as changes in land use
(c.f. residential to commercial) over that period. The City Directory record of occupancy
is presented in total in Appendix 1 to this report. Residents are tied to mapped structures
derived from the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps in Appendix 2, Figures A-1 to A-5.
Ethnicity data, in the form of distinction between African American and white residents,
is reported from the first directory including Project Area addresses in 1894-1895 through
1920. The overlap between this coverage and that of the Sanborn maps allows this
occupancy to be depicted graphically, as well. (See Appendix 2, Figures B-1 to B-5.)

6

These disturbances have also been directly observed to a certain extent during the concurrent demolition
monitoring field work. These results are integrated into the recommendations section of this report.

CHAPTER III
DOCUMENTARY RESULTS and ARCHEOLOGICAL
ASSESSMENT

The desktop research, following the methodology outlined above, has yielded an
abundance of imagery and other data which permits an archeological assessment of the
six-block Project Area. It became quickly apparent that the proposed Dynamo Stadium
location is not within the earliest core area of Houston’s urban development. The
embryonic City of Houston spread to the southeast along the axis of Main Street from
Allens Landing on Buffalo Bayou. The young city simultaneously expanded to the
[street grid] east and west of Main Street as the march of occupation proceeded to the
south. Houston’s core of development, then entirely residential had reached the Minute
Maid Park tract immediately [grid] west of the proposed Dynamo Stadium site well
before 1865.
This expansion had not extended far enough east to include the stadium site by the
time that the Wood Map of Houston, the earliest map depicting comprehensively
individual structures within the city was drafted in 1869. This invaluable resource, which
also lists property ownership, is exhibited as Figure 3. No buildings appear within the
six-block area on this map. Ownership of four of the Project Area blocks are, however,
listed as follows:
Block 203: L. N. Daley
Block 204: Dupree
Block 205: Montgomery
Block 218: J. Dickinson
Historic-period occupation of the Project Area appears to begin a few years later
on Block 205 (Figure 4). This small building, depicted on the 1873 Bird’s Eye Map of
the City of Houston, has disappeared by 1891, the date at which another Bird’s Eye Map
and the next source of structure data, was published. Curiously, the small 1873 building
is the only structure depicted on Block 205 between 1873 and 1925.
While the 1873 building had disappeared from Block 205 by 1891, the colorful
Bird’s Eye Map of Houston of that year (Figure 5) is the first source documenting the
construction of two or more buildings on every other block of the Project Area. This first
indication that Houston had expanded into the vicinity of the Dynamo Stadium tract is
reinforced by the very detailed Sanborn Fire Insurance maps into the area in 1896.

Only one other map besides the Bird’s Eye of 1891 provides some information on
land use between 1873 and the extension of Sanborn Fire Insurance maps into the area in
1896. The Thomas Map of 1890 (Figure 6) bears labels indicating the presence of barrel
and soap factories in or adjacent to the Project Area.

The confluence of Sanborn Fire Insurance maps and City Directory coverage

allows us to present the Project Area in exquisitely fine-scaled detail from the closing
decade of the Nineteenth Century through the end of the first half of the Twentieth
Century (Figures 7-10 and Appendix 2, Figures B-1 to B-5). At the scale of larger
structures, we can distinguish dwelling from commercial buildings through their Sanborn
labels. These labels also provide information on infrastructure details such as the nature
of street paving and the location of utility lines, as well as rare and curious features such
as “rock bins” (Figure 9). Plotted location s of a host of minor outbuildings can provide
direction in the location of archeologically productive features such as privy pits.
The archeological utility of Sanborn maps in investigations of Houston’s past has
been limited in many prior instances by the relatively late initial date of this mapping in
the City. The earliest Sanborn mapping in Houston (which does not extend for enough to
include the proposed stadium site7) was done in 1884. There are elements of the late
Nineteenth and early Twentieth century occupation and land use within the Dynamo
Stadium tract that support the assertion that significant new archeological information
may survive within the tract. One potential instance of new and henceforth underinvestigated topics in Houston’s historical archeological record is that of commercial
occupations, specifically neighborhood retail stores. The Sanborns provide conclusive
evidence that such businesses were located within the Project Area in the last decade of
the Nineteenth Century and the first decade of the Twentieth Century.
The spatial data on occupational ethnicity provided by using the Sanborn maps
and City Directories in concert offer an avenue to possible significant new archeological
insights that is at least as important as the commerce investigation. The documentary
data does not suggest that the tract may offer information on the African American
community in Houston in the critical Reconstruction period, but it clearly can support
examination of ethnicity issues in an area where Anglo-Americans and African
Americans lived in very close proximity, indeed often as next door neighbors, during the
years around the close of the Nineteenth Century (Appendix 2, Figures B-1 to B-5).
Surviving archeological deposits from these adjacent occupancies may provide
fascinating insights into the economic, social, and material contrasts and similarities
between these two important groups.

7

The exclusion of the Project Area from the 1884 Sanborn Maps may be a rare instance when negative
documentary information has some actual interpretive value. Expansion of Sanborn maps was driven by
the expansion of the substantial built environment that required fire insurance services. The lack of
coverage in 1884 may, therefore, provide some degree of evidence for the initiation of significant urban infilling within the Project Area.

We can next proceed to the consideration of soil disturbances that post-date the
deposition of archeological deposits of presumed significance within the six-block project
area. The principal disturbances are presumed to be construction of buildings that date to
after the first decade of the Twentieth Century and the disturbances resulting from both
the installation and removal of railroad tracks that once extensively traversed the Project
Area. We will be ‘skipping ahead’ to a slight extent in order to include information from
the archeological demolition monitoring conducted as a part of the current investigation.
The assessment of post-depositional disturbances was derived from both the
demolition monitoring observations and from the analysis of a series of aerial
photographs dating from 1944 to 1995. (See Appendix 2, Figures E-1 to E-6.) The areas
of presumed lesser (yellow shading) and greater (red shading) disturbance are exhibited
in Figure 11. Un-shaded areas are presumed to have the least degree of soil disturbance.
The moderately disturbed yellow areas unite the rail footprints with those of buildings
with little or no foundation excavation extending below natural grade. These buildings
exhibit slabs (often elevated above grade on select fill) and perimeter beam foundations
that do extend below grade. These structures, however, are without the internal, belled
piers extending to about 10 feet below slab grade that were exposed within the redshaded building during demolition.
Figure 12 then overlays onto this disturbance map the structures present on both
the 1896 and 1907 Sanborn maps to provide a rough illustration of the effect of the
ground disturbances on potential archeological remains. Figure 13 then distills this
overlap into a plot of areas of high and moderate archeological potential based on both
early occupancy and later disturbances.

predicted to exhibit moderate impacts.

CHAPTER IV
DEMOLITION MONITORING

Field Investigation
Between the months of November 2008 and January 2009 MAC monitored
demolitions occurring within the Project Area. The Project Area is bounded by Texas,
Dowling, Walker, and Hutchins Streets. Most of the existing buildings were located
along Bastrop Street, which bisects the Project Area.
Field methods used during monitoring followed the general procedures outlined in
the Technical Proposal presented with the Antiquities Permit Application. This proposal
sought to utilize the building demolition and slab removals as opportunities to view soil
surfaces and perhaps limited profile exposures within the Project Area, as well as to
ensure that sensitive archeological deposits were not disturbed during the demolition.
Information from the monitoring will supplement the data from the documentary study to
improve the design of the formal Subsurface Survey phase of archeological investigation.
Most of the buildings scattered across the Project Area were relatively modern metal
structures built on slabs, though the two largest structures were of masonry construction
(Figures 14, 15). Any informative soil observations were documented by photographs
and written descriptions.

Southwest corner of Bastrop and Rusk streets.

streets.
The field investigations were conducted under the supervision of Principal
Investigator Roger G. Moore, Ph.D. and Project Archeologist Kelly Schexnayder in
coordination with demolition activities conducted by Cherry Demolition. The practical
goal of the monitoring program was to ensure that the removal of any subsurface
structures, i.e. piers, was closely observed for significant archeological features and/or
artifacts and that all backdirt piles were inspected.
The basic methodology of Cherry Demolition was the demolition and clearing of:
building constructions, concrete perimeters, foundation slabs and any subsurface
structures (i.e. piers) associated with the building. All select fill was flattened and left in
place.
Results
MAC personnel witnessed the removal of five commercial buildings within the
Project Area. All five buildings were above street grade, atop concrete perimeter
foundations containing sandy select fill; only one of the five contained piers that
extended through the fill and below the street grade. This building was the Janco
warehouse (Figure 16) located on the southeast block of Bastrop and Rusk. The Janco
building contained 15 piers, spaced 60 ft apart, which continued 10 ft. below the slab. At
the base of each pier was a 4 ft. wide bell. The trackhoe operator dug 3 ft. beneath the
base of each bell, extending the trench below street grade and into Beaumont clay. This
resulted in 15 trenches that were 10-12 ft. long, 6 ft. wide, and 13-15 ft. deep.
23

Figure 16. Ongoing demolition of the Janco building above grade.
The Janco building trench profiles typically revealed 3 feet of sandy select fill
overlaying 3-5 feet of various layers of disturbed soils (often oily or ashy clay). These
disturbed soils in turn rested on top of Beaumont clay. Artifacts were noted coming
from the trenches along the northern portion of the block. Artifacts collected out of the
backfill appeared to be from possibly the late Nineteenth to mid-Twentieth Century based
on bottle manufacture types (machine-made and embossed), square nails, milk glass, and
ceramics. The ceramics observed were mostly thick whiteware but also decorated sherds
such as spongeware, flow blue, and green transferware. Trenches toward the southern
portion (Walker) revealed creosote-soaked fill that was either ashy and oily or shellbased. Along the west edge of the Janco building, beneath the slab and sandy fill, the
operator discovered another aggregate concrete slab underlain by sandy fill. The second
slab was 3 ft. thick and roughly 20 ft. x 20 ft. It appeared to be associated with the
building so it was pulled out, resulting in a pit measuring 10 ft. deep below the top slab
(Figure 17). The project archeologist noted artifacts from the backfill in this area to be of
the same period as the others.

There were no features observed within the entire Project Area with the exception
of one backfilled trench along the north edge of the Janco block which revealed a few in
situ bricks that may have been handmade (Figure 18).

It is the opinion of Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. that structure demolition
and removal at monitored locations were carried out in such a manner as to have ensured
that any significant archeological features revealed during subsurface disturbance were
observed and recorded.

CHAPTER V
CONCLUSIONS and RECOMMENDATIONS

Analysis of the documentary evidence and results of the archeological monitoring
both support the twin assertions that significant archeological deposits and features may
have been present within the Dynamo Stadium Project Area, and that the prospect for the
survival of these deposits to the present day is fairly bright. It is not likely, based on this
current evidence, that archeological investigations in the area will yield information on
Native American occupations, or on the infancy of the City of Houston. Remains within
the area may, however, allow us to propose equally interesting – and henceforth little
examined – questions regarding neighborhood commerce and racial relations in the older,
but still young, City of Houston.
The prospect of examining the material remains of Anglos and persons of color
living adjacent to each other is especially intriguing, since the graphic and historical data
indicates that they were living in proximity as neighbors on a superficially equal footing,
rather than in a ‘master-servant’ relationship such as that examined at Ashton Villa in
Galveston before and after the Civil War. The Project Area may therefore provide
interesting new information on broadly domestic relations prior to (or as an alternative to)
the strict segregation of the Jim Crow era of the first half of the Twentieth Century,
We will next provide the Clients and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission with a proposal for selected areas within the six-block tract for
archeological examination by mechanically assisted Subsurface Survey. This survey
methodology, involving both mechanical trenching and the stripping of disturbed
deposits from block areas believed to contain important remains, is a very effective, cost
efficient, and practical means to determine the presence or absence of significant remains
within an urban tract such as the current Project Area. MAC has applied it repeatedly
and successfully within the Houston Central Business District, and we believe that it
provides a sound approach to securing regulatory clearances for the proposed project.
