Abstract
In May and July of 2016, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural
resources survey for the proposed Sabine River Authority Sabine River pump station and
pipeline route in Orange and Newton Counties, Texas. The total project area covers 128 acres,
which will be utilized for the construction of a pump station and water pipeline.
Archeological investigations, conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7597, consisted of
a pedestrian survey and the manual excavation of 133 shovel tests within the Area of Potential
Effect (APE). Field archeologists observed numerous landscape modifications resulting from
transportation, commercial and residential development, and timbering. No archeological sites
or isolated finds are located within the proposed construction footprint. Additionally, AmaTerra
historians surveyed the APE for historic-age resources built in or before 1973 and identified
20 properties. After evaluating these for eligibility in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), project historians recommend that two of the surveyed properties, immediately
adjacent to one another, are eligible for NRHP listing: the Deweyville Swing Bridge, which
was previously listed in the NRHP, and the Texas Centennial Marker, which was included as
contributing to the Deweyville Swing Bridge and is a class of resource that has been found
to be NRHP-eligible across the state. Because the proposed undertaking would not diminish
the integrity of the Deweyville Swing Bridge or the Texas Centennial Marker, impair their
ability to convey significance, or introduce substantial direct or indirect effects, a finding of
no adverse effect is recommended. Based on the results of AmaTerra’s field investigations, the
Principal Investigators recommend for the project to proceed with no further work warranted.
No artifacts were collected during this survey. All documents and photographs generated during
this survey will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Laboratory in Austin.

Introduction and Project Description
In May and July of 2016, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural
resources survey in advance of the proposed construction of the Sabine River Authority’s
(SRA) proposed Sabine River pump station and pipeline in Orange and Newton Counties,
Texas. The project is located southwest from the Sabine River in Deweyville, Texas to the
existing SRA Gulf Coast Canal system south of Forest Heights, Texas (Figure 1).
The proposed new pump station is located on the west bank of the Sabine River, south of State
Highway (SH) 12 on the eastern outskirts of Deweyville. At this location, SRA will construct
a new 85-million-gallon-per-day (MGD) pump station. This new pump station will replace
an existing pump station elsewhere in the vicinity that is nearing the end of its useful life.
The pump station includes constructing a 285 MGD intake, pump station building housing
vertical turbine pumps, electrical service, and flow metering facilities. An existing county road
is proposed to ultimately be relocated but that work is considered independent of the pump
station construction and is not included in this evaluation.
To deliver this water to SRA’s existing canal system, project plans call for a pipeline. The
proposed pipeline alignment measures approximately seven miles in length, and runs
southwest from the proposed pump station site, roughly paralleling SH 12 before turning south
approximately one mile west of SH 87, and terminating at the Gulf Coast Canal (Figure 2).
SRA intends to purchase a 120-foot-wide (36.6 meters [m]) permanent easement within which
to initially install a 66-inch diameter pipe with room left for a possible second, large diameter
pipe to be installed at a future date. The pipeline depths will vary depending on the terrain,
utilities, and roads being crossed. The pipelines will typically be installed with a depth to the
top of pipe of at least six feet through primarily open-cut trenching. Subsurface bores may be
used to cross utilities and roadways.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources is defined as the footprint of
the proposed project to the maximum depth of impact(s), including all easements and project
specific staging locations. Thus, the APE for archeological resources will cover a total area of
128 acres to a typical depth of 12 feet (reaching 20–25 feet in some locations). In consultation
with the Texas Historical Commission, historians defined the historic resources APE as (1)
a 1000-foot radius from the pump station site; (b) 450 feet (225 feet on each side) along the
pipeline from the pump station to the connection with the existing canal. With the construction
letting date of 2018, the cut-off date for survey of historic-age resources 45 years old or older
is 1973.
All construction for this project will take place within lands currently owned by SRA (the pump
station) or within permanent easements on private property that will eventually be granted to
SRA. Additionally, during the process of easement negotiation, some land owners may request
SRA purchase the corridor outright. Because the project is being sponsored by the SRA and

will be constructed within public ROWs, it is subject to provisions of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). In addition, although no federal lands are currently part of this undertaking, the
project requires individual permits or preconstruction notifications under Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act, and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act therefore, does
apply as well. Accordingly, the archeological and non-archeological historic resources surveys
are intended to provide compliance with both State and Federal regulations.
Coordination with the SRA resulted in a survey recommendation for the entire APE.
Archeological investigations consisted of a pedestrian survey, and shovel testing of all
accessible portions of the APE. Field investigations took place July 11–14, 2016 under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 7597. Nick Trierweiler acted as Principal Investigator and Katherine
Seikel served as Project Archeologist. A total of 152-person hours were expended in the
field in support of this project. No artifacts were recorded or collected during this survey. All
documents and photographs generated during fieldwork for this project will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
Non-archeological historic resources investigations consisted of a reconnaissance survey of the
project APE on May 9, 2016 to identify historic-age resources (45 years of age or older) within
the project APE. The field survey consisted of examining the APE for historic-age resources,
photographing the historic-age resources in the APE, and examining associated groups of
buildings, structures, objects, and sites for potential historic districts or rural historic landscapes.
Project personnel surveyed all parcels within the APE. The survey team photographed historicage resources within the 1,000-foot radius of the pump station site and 450 feet around the
pipeline footprint. All historic-age properties were evaluated under the criteria, set forth in 36
CFR 60.4, with particular emphasis on Criteria A–C, which relate to a property’s association
with A) important themes, events or patterns in history, B) the lives of important people, or
C) a distinctive architectural style or method of construction. The field survey and subsequent
research identified a total of 20 historic-age properties within the project’s APE including the
Deweyville Swing Bridge which is listed in the NRHP.
This report is divided into seven chapters. The project background and cultural overview
are discussed in Chapters 2 through 4. Chapter 5 includes the field methodology and the
results of field investigations are discussed in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 presents the summary
and recommendations. Appendix A depicts shovel test locations and Appendix B contains the
shovel testing log. Appendix C is a tabular inventory of those resources, and Appendix D
contains the photographs of the surveyed non-archeological historic-age resources.

Project Background
The project area is located within and southwest of Deweyville, Texas in an area which has
limited residential and commercial development. However, historic maps dating to the 1860s
indicate that the earliest development around the project area occurred along SH 87, and maps
from the 1950s show development present in largely the same areas where structures currently
exist. Residential and commercial development around the project area has not significantly
increased since the 1950s, though structures impacted by floods may have been demolished,
rebuilt or replaced.

2.1 	Environmental Setting
Topography along the alignments is generally flat, punctuated by low-lying marshes and
oxbow lakes that are relics of former creek and river channels. Tree cover consists of a mix of
pine hardwoods, interspersed with willow oak, water oak, and blackgum forests. Understory
vegetation comprises yaupon (lex vomitoria), Carolina jessamine (Gelsemium sempervirens),
Greenbriar (Smilax), brownseed papsalum (Paspalum plicatuluum), as well as a variety of
grasses and perennial forbs.
The geology of the project area is dominated by sands and clay of the Beaumont Formation,
which formed during the late Pleistocene and Early Holocene Epochs. A second formation,
the Deweyville Formation, is mapped in the easternmost portion of the project area. This
formation was laid down during the Late Pleistocene and is generally considered to have low
geoarcheological potential, though more recent soil veneers over the top of the Deweyville
Formation could contain archeological remains (Abbott 2001).
Nineteen individual soil units are mapped, belonging to four main soil associations within the
two proposed alignments (Figure 3). These are deep soils that tend to be composed of silty
loams and fine sands interspersed with dense clay and mud at the locations of oxbow features
and low marshes (USDA-NRCS 2016).

2.2 	Land Modifications and Historical Land Use
During the Historic Period, this area has been lightly populated. Small-scale farming and stock
raising were the principal industries until the 1880s when logging transformed East Texas
(Wooster 2010a). The town of Deweyville began as a ferry crossing of the Sabine River during
the second half of the nineteenth century. In 1898 the Sabine Tram Company built a sawmill at
the ferry crossing and established a company timbering town called Deweyville, named after
Spanish American war hero, Adm. George Dewey. Several spur lines, including the Texarkana
and Fort Smith Railway, the Sabine and Neches Valley Railway, and a short line to Gist were
built to the town during the early twentieth century, linking Deweyville to important markets.

For a brief period, it was the largest city in Newton County, but a fire in the sawmill in 1943,
and the general collapse of the timber industry in East Texas due to the Great Depression and
deforestation led to the abandonment of the Sabine and Neches Valley Railway line (Wooster
2010b). The town never recovered its pre-war population.
An 1863 topographic map of the area between the Sabine and Neches Rivers encompasses the
entire project area (Figure 4). It shows the area surrounding the proposed alignment as a mix
of pine forests, marshes, and thicket, with dispersed farm settlements around it. There was one
residence in the Deweyville area along the Sabine River, occupied by the Pitman family. The
only other farmstead that appears to be close to the alignment is not named, but occurs near
what is now SH 12, just east of SH 87 at Stephens Cutoff Road.
A series 15-minute topographical maps from the 1950s indicate that SH 12 was built by that
time and show development in Deweyville and along SH 12 between the Sabine River and
SH 87 (Figure 5). Several structures and oil wells are located west of SH 87, near the alignment.

2.3

Archeological Site Potential

There are no recorded cultural resources which are immediately adjacent to the proposed
alignment. Based on review of historical maps and secondary sources, the potential for historic
period archeological remains and cultural resources is generally low, except near the town of
Deweyville and near SH 87. The former is a late nineteenth century timber town and the latter
has been a primary transportation artery through Newton County since before the Civil War.
Potential for prehistoric archeological remains is low to moderate. Although no prehistoric
archeological sites have been recorded near the alignments, this is largely due to the lack
of systematic surveys in the area. Prehistoric archeological remains would most likely occur
along ridges and the slight topographic rises that occur throughout the project area. A review
of recorded sites within Newton County shows that most prehistoric sites are found on hilltops
and hillslopes overlooking waterways. The areas of greatest topographical relief in the project
area occur at Deweyville and near SH 87, with the most significant topographical variations
located in the easternmost quarter of the proposed route.

Chapter 3

Cultural Background
Within the state of Texas, archeological regions of the state tend to reflect that of topographical
settings. This division is seen in Turner and Hester’s (1999) model of the archeological regions
of Texas, where Texas is divided in to nine archeological regions, all based on geography.
Although the divisions of Turner and Hester’s (1999) are generally accepted, Perttula (2004)
further divides these regions into 16 distinct archeological regions based on physiographic
zones and biotic communities. Both models are used interchangeably by archeologists when
describing and defining the cultural chronology of their project area. Despite these regional
breakdowns of the archeological areas of Texas, not all archeological sites fall within the clear
cut chronological sequences provided for these areas. In some cases archeological sites may
lie at the cusp or confluence of two or three distinct archeological regions, therefore reflecting
different aspects of those different regions. In cases such as these, rather than confining to one
regional chronological sequence, chronological sequences of the surrounding regions must
also be taken into consideration.
The project area is located in the Piney Woods and Gulf Prairies and Marshes portions of the
Southeast Texas archeological region as defined by Perttula (2004). According to research
conducted at archeological sites in this region, evidence of human occupation in the region
roughly spans 12,000/11,500 years before present (BP) to the present (Ricklis 2004). These years
of occupation are typically divided into five main periods based on technological and cultural
changes seen throughout the archeological record. These five main periods are as follows:
the Paleoindian (12,000/11,500–8,500/8000 BP); the Archaic (8,500/8,000–2,000/1,500 BP);
the Ceramic (2,000 BP–1,250 BP [AD 700]), the Late Prehistoric (AD 700–1650); and the
Historic (AD 1650–1950s) (Ricklis 2004). The following is a general overview of trends seen
during each period.

3.1	Paleoindian Period (ca. 11,500–8000 BP)
The arrival of humans in the New World occurred between 16,000 and 14,500 BP (Gilbert et al.
2008, Pitblado 2011), and until recently, it was generally thought that the Paleoindian Period
in Texas did not begin until around 12,000 BP (Perttula 2004). However, new evidence from
the Debra Friedkin and Gault sites in Central Texas have begun to push the date of earliest
occupation back to around 15,000 BP (Swaminathan 2014; Gault School 2016). Generally,
there is a lack of data relating to the Paleoindian Period in Southeast Texas and archeological
excavation of any Paleoindian site has yet to be undertaken. While many projectile points such
as Clovis, Plainview, Folsom, Scottsbluff, and San Patrice have been recovered, most were
isolated, mixed, or surface finds, or found in excavations of later contexts (Ricklis 2004). The
distribution of artifacts suggests that most sites occur along major streams or within major
stream drainages.

Because of the paucity of evidence, no detailed understanding of settlement mobility and
subsistence patterns during the Paleoindian period in Southeast Texas has been developed.
What evidence does exist suggests that groups likely engaged in a mix of hunting and gathering,
and since many of the lithic tools recovered were made of materials that are sparse or absent
in the region, extensive movement of people and materials over the landscape has also been
suggested (Ricklis 2004).

3.2

Archaic Period (ca. 8000–1500 BP)

Many Archaic sites have been found in this region, mostly near major streams, and these
are represented by flaked stone dart points and other lithic tools. A general outline of dart
point chronology during this period in Southeast Texas is available (Ricklis 2004), yet the lack
of any other evidence (i.e., faunal, botanical, etc.), allows for little generalization regarding
subsistence strategies other than the suggestion that groups were likely engaged in some form
of hunting and gathering. By the Late Archaic period, the use of poor quality and local lithic
materials suggest reduced mobility and smaller, more localized territories.
The use of cemeteries in this region, most notably the Ernest Witte cemetery, became
increasingly important culturally by the Late Archaic period. These cemeteries could be quite
large and often contained grave goods. For example, Group 2 of the Ernest Witte cemetery
contained 145 individuals along with lithic debris, bone pins, and shell beads and pendants.
Archaic sites in the Coastal region of Southeast Texas consist mostly of shell middens. Most
are located along the shores of secondary bays or in and around river mouths and deltas (Ricklis
2004). The most complete Archaic sequence of occupation in this region was recovered from
the Eagle’s Ridge site, a densely stratified shell midden. A large sample of features and artifacts
from the earliest part of the period to the latest were recovered at the midden, which contains
mostly Rangia cuneata, but also oyster shells. By the Late Archaic (ca. 3,000 BP), the increase
in number of sites discovered has led researchers to suggest significant population growth
occurred during this period.

3.3	Ceramic Period (ca. 2000–1250 BP [700 AD])
The Ceramic Period in Southeast Texas has been defined as the point at which ceramics first
appeared, and thus signaling the end of the Archaic Period. During the Early Ceramic period,
while ceramics were introduced from Louisiana and the Lower Mississippi Valley, there is not
much evidence of major changes in lifeways. Ceramic Period artifacts recovered overlying
Archaic ones near river drainages suggest consistent patterns in subsistence and settlement
over time. Story et al. (1990) coined the term Mossy Grove Tradition/Culture to describe
groups that occupied areas surrounding Galveston Bay (including the current project area)
during the Ceramic Period.

12

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 3

3.4	Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 700–1650 AD)
This period is usually defined by the introduction of the bow and arrow. Evidence from the
Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) suggests that the Late Prehistoric in Southeast Texas can be
divided into the Initial Late Prehistoric sub-period, represented by Scallorn arrow points, and the
Final Late Prehistoric sub-period. The Final Late period correlates with the well-documented
Toyah phase, as defined by an abundance of bison bone and a lithic assemblage geared towards
the processing of the meat and hides of large game (Ricklis 2004).

3.5	Historic Period (1650–1970s AD)
The Historic Period in Texas begins with the arrival of the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca in
1528. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the French and Spanish made forays into
Texas for the sake of exploration and trade, though no permanent European settlements were
successful until the late seventeenth century. Archeological sites dating to this period contain
a mix of both European (e.g., metal and glass arrow points, trade beads, and wheel-made or
glazed ceramics) and traditional Native American artifacts (e.g., manufactured stone tools).
The effect that Europeans had on Indians in Texas prior to about 1700 is not well-understood.
What is known is that the initial wave of Spanish and French missionaries and explorers
spread disease that killed, displaced, and fragmented a huge percentage of the population. As
colonization spread from Mexico, many of the Coahuiltecan groups moved northward to avoid
the Spanish. At the same time, invading Indian groups from the north put pressure on Native
American groups in North Texas (Nickels et al. 1997). Historians believe that these pressures
led to intense territorial disputes, further destabilizing Native American populations.

3.5.1 Newton County and Deweyville
The land encompassing Newton County was part of the Lorenzo de Zavala 1829 land grant
from the Mexican government. From 1834–1835, 21 settlers moved into the county and its
boundaries were established in 1846. In 1860, the Newton County economy was based on
agriculture, primarily cotton, corn, potatoes, cattle, hogs, sheep and horses. Although the
county supported few large plantations, over a third of the population were slaves by the start
of the Civil War. The county was mostly spared the turmoil of the war and Reconstruction.
Between the end of the war and the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the number of
farms in the county doubled. Sheep briefly joined the agricultural staples of corn, cotton, cattle,
and hogs (Wooster 2010a).
While agriculture remained important, the Post-Reconstruction economy shifted to rely
heavily on the lumber industry. In 1889, the Sabine Tram Company bought 28,000 acres in
southern Newton County and floated their cut logs to Bancroft and Gilmer sawmills in Orange
(Block 2005). In 1898, they constructed their own 150,000-square foot sawmill in the newly
established town of Deweyville at an old ferry crossing on the Sabine River. In order to ease
the transport of the timber, the Sabine Tram Company worked with the Texarkana and Fort
Smith Railway to construct a railroad spur to their mill. The Sabine Tram Company provided

13

the right of way, grading, and railroad ties, while the Texarkana and Fort Smith supplied and
laid the steel. The line was complete in 1899 and linked the Sabine River to Beaumont (Texas
Transportation Archive n.d.a). This led to a growth of the lumber industry and the town of
Deweyville itself. Deweyville was a company town. The company owned the general store,
hotel, community house, and employee housing (Wooster, 2010b).
Other smaller towns emerged near Deweyville in Newton County. Hartburg was established
near the intersection of SH 12 and SH 87. It was established in 1896, but experienced its
first real growth after the arrival of the Texarkana and Fort Smith Railway in 1897 and the
construction of the Williams Lumber Company sawmill in 1903. When the forests declined the
mill was closed in 1929 and the population declined (Wooster 2010c).
In 1919, the Sabine Tram Company closed the mill when they ran out of timber and A.J.
Peavy of Shreveport of the Peavy-Moore Lumber Company purchased the facility. Sabine
Tram Company moved to Camptown, Texas three miles northwest of Deweyville and operated
a mill there from 1922–1945. In Deweyville, Peavy-Moore operated two separate sawmills at
the former Sabine Tram Company plant site, Yellow Pine mill, and a hardwood mill (Wooster
2010d; Texas Transportation Archive n.d.b and n.d.c). Peavy built an additional railroad line
from Deweyville to Gist, and the Sabine and Neches Valley Railway soon linked Deweyville
to Orange and the Northwestern Railway. By 1929, the lumber industry reported $4 million
in production and over two-thirds of the Newton County workforce was employed in nonagricultural fields (Wooster 2010a). In 1942, the Kurth Company bought the plant, but in 1943,
the mill burned down and was not rebuilt. In 1946, the Sabine and Neches Valley removed their
railroad tracks and installations (Block 2005; Toledo-Bend.com n.d.).
After the sawmills closed and the railroads left, the population in Deweyville and Newton
County declined through 1960. Brief spurts in the economy and the county population
occurred in 1949 when oil was discovered in Hartburg and in 1960 when oil was discovered
in Camptown (Wooster 2010c; Wooster 2010d). Post-1960 highway improvements and
construction of US 190 and SH 87 allowed for the possibility of commuting to Orange and
Beaumont and encouraged population growth. Deweyville is now considered a bedroom
community of Orange and Beaumont (Wooster 2010b).

3.5.2 Orange County
Orange County was first colonized by Alonso Álvarez de Pineda for Spain in 1519. This
became a contested portion of land between France and Spain as French traders operated in the
land by 1718. France ceded the land to Spain in 1763. After the Louisiana Purchase the land
became an item of dispute between Spain and the United States until the Adams-Onís Treaty
in 1819. By 1826, the Republic of Mexico offered land grants to Anglo settlers. Joseph Vehlein
had colonization rights for the land until 1834 when they were transferred to the Galveston
Bay Texas Land Company. Orange County itself was formed from part of Jefferson County
in 1852. The Texas and New Orleans Railway reached Orange in 1861. After closing down
for the Civil War, the railroad returned to Orange in 1876. During that year, Henry Jacob
Lutcher and G. Bedell Moore opened the Lutcher-Moore Lumber Company. The economy

surged as jobs in the lumber industry, ship building and construction became available. In
1881, the Southern Pacific Railway arrived in Orange and allowed for shipment between San
Francisco and New Orleans. Orange was a major rail center and port. In addition to the lumber
industry, the Orange Rice Mill opened in 1901 and the Yell Mill (a mill that used raw yellow
pine shavings as raw product) in 1904. Oil was discovered at the Bland well in 1913 and the
Oscar Chesson well in 1922. The county saw a record population in 1920 as oil refineries and
oil-related manufacturers added to employment opportunities. The Great Depression brought
a decline in industry, but World War II reversed that decline as companies such as DuPont,
Allied, Spencer, Firestone, Goodrich-Gulf and shipbuilding industries began operation. These
industries continued to dominate the county’s economy through the 1970s (Mason, 2010).

3.5.3 The Sabine River Authority and Water Control (1949–present)
The Sabine River Authority was established by the Texas Legislature in 1949. Its jurisdiction
encompasses the entire Sabine River watershed in Texas. It is headquartered in Orange with five
administrative units. The Gulf Coast Division has authority over the water supply in the Orange
area. It consists of a pumping station and canal network that supplies water for irrigation and
industrial use (Long 2010). The John W. Simmons Gulf Coast Canal System is operated by the
Gulf Coast Division. The 75-mile long canal system was originally constructed in the 1930s by
the Orange County Water Company and used to provide raw water to industries, a municipality,
rice farmers, and crawfish producers. The SRA purchased the system in 1954. It is currently
used primarily to provide water to municipalities and industries, such as petrochemical plants,
a pulp and paper mill, a steel plant, and an electrical generating station. It also provides water
for rice irrigation, crawfish and catfish farming, and other miscellaneous uses. (SRA 2012: 22;
SRA: n.d.). The main canal is approximately 30 miles long and has over 45 miles of lateral
canals (AECOM 2009: 6). It was named the John W. Simmons Gulf Coast Canal System in
2002. Simmons was the first general manager and later the executive vice president of SRA
(SRA 2012: 21).

Previous Investigations
Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through the THC’s
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas), the THC’s Historic Sites Atlas, the TxDOT Historic Properties
and Districts Database, and the TxDOT Historic Bridges Database. Research focused on the
identification of archeological sites, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), sites listed as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs), neighborhood surveys, cemeteries, and previously conducted archeological surveys
within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE. According to the Atlas and the records at TARL,
there are no previously recorded archeological sites within the APE, however, six previous
archeological surveys have occurred within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE.
Of the six surveys within a kilometer of the proposed route, four previous archeological surveys
intersect or overlap slightly with the proposed alignments. None of these surveys identified
sites within a kilometer of the current APE. The previous surveys are detailed in Table 1 and
depicted on Figure 6.
One NRHP property and one historical marker were found within one kilometer (0.62 miles)
of the project area. Neither resource would be affected or displaced by the proposed project
activities.
There is one Official State Historical Marker along the combined alignments near SH 12 at
Deweyville. The marker commemorates the town of Deweyville, which was founded in 1886
and originally called Possum Bluff. The town had a ferry crossing across the Sabine and its
principal industry was timbering. A sawmill operated in town from the end of the nineteenth
century to the middle of twentieth century (Wooster 2010b).
One NRHP-listed resource is within one kilometer (0.62 miles) of the project along SH 12
at the Sabine River. The Deweyville Swing Bridge was built across the Sabine in 1938 using
Depression-era relief funds and is the oldest swing bridge in the state. The bridge swings open
from a center pivot to allow boats to travel along the river.

Methodology
5.1

Archeology

Prior to the field investigations, archeologists conducted archival research to assess the
potential for buried or near-surface historic archeological materials. This research involved
examining historical maps (Perry-Castañeda Library 2016) and aerial photographs (USGS
2016). As mentioned above, archeologists consulted soils and the Atlas to assess the potential
for prehistoric archeological sites within the APE. Consulting these resources not only allowed
investigators to determine the presence of previously recorded archeological sites within the
APE, but also to gain a sense of site types (e.g., historic or prehistoric), artifact types, and
average depth of cultural material below the surface, among other things.
Archeological investigations were carried out in accordance with the THC/CTA survey
standards (as referenced in 13 TAC 26.20 and THC policy). AmaTerra inspected the entire
available APE for direct impacts to the natural landscape. This inspection was conducted
on foot through visual reconnaissance. As a result, archeologists observed multiple areas
of disturbance, including push piles, soils overturned due to timbering, buried pipelines,
railroad grades, and disturbance from previous construction. These areas were photographed
and archeologists made notes on the conditions they encountered during their investigations.
Archeologists shovel tested in some of these locations to confirm disturbance of soils.
As the proposed undertaking measured an area of five acres, the CTA-recommended rate of
two shovel tests per acre for areal surveys meant that up to 16 shovel tests were proposed for
the pump station area, and the recommended rate of 16 shovel tests per linear mile for linear
surveys meant that up to 240 shovel test were proposed along the proposed pipeline route. A
total of 256 shovel tests were initially recommended for this project. However, because rightof-entry was not available for four percent of the project area and 19 percent of the project area
crossed existing wetland or swampy areas, and other highly disturbed areas (e.g. roadways),
133 shovel tests were distributed throughout the accessible APE in areas without standing
water in an effort to locate any existing archeological sites.
Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and extended to a maximum depth of 80 cm below
the surface or until restrictive features (e.g., water or basal clay) were encountered. The shovel
tests were excavated in 10 cm increments and all soil was screened through a ¼-inch mesh
hardware cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests was recorded on a standardized form.
Shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. This archeological investigation was a noncollection survey; therefore, if artifacts had been encountered during the course of the work,
they would have been returned to their original location.

19

Cultural Resource Survey of the Sabine River Authority’s Sabine River Pump Station and Pipeline,

Initially, backhoe trenching in areas with deep soil deposits was proposed for this project. Due
to the scattered distribution of deep soil deposits, disturbance of soils near the Sabine River
from past construction events, and the presence of marshes and swampy areas within the APE,
backhoe trenching was not warranted.
Archeological sites were to be defined using the THC/CTA standards (as referenced in 13
TAC 26.20). Thus, an archeological site had to contain a certain number of cultural materials
or features older than 50 years of age within a given area. The definition of a site is: (1) five
or more surface artifacts within a 15-m (50-foot) radius; (2) a single cultural feature, such as
a midden or cistern, observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing; (3) a positive
shovel test containing at least five total artifacts; or (4) two positive shovel tests located within
30 m (98 feet) of each other. Archeologists did not document any archeological material which
met these criteria.

5.2 	Historic Resources
Field surveyors performed a reconnaissance survey of the project APE on May 9, 2016 to
identify historic-age resources (45 years of age or older) within the project APE. The field
survey consisted of: (A) examining the APE for historic-age structures; (B) photographing
historic age resources in the APE; and (C) examining associated groups of buildings, structures,
objects, and sites for potential historic districts or rural historic landscapes.
Project personnel surveyed a 1,000-foot radius around the pump station and 225 feet from the
pipeline centerline. All historic-age properties were evaluated under the criteria, set forth in 36
CFR 60.4, with particular emphasis on Criteria A-C, which relate to a property’s association
with A) important themes, events or patterns in history, B) the lives of important people, or
C) a distinctive architectural style or method of construction. The field survey and subsequent
research identified a total of 20 historic-age properties within the project’s APE: one agricultural
property, three commercial properties, fourteen residential properties, one religious property
and one transportation property.

5.3 	Realignment of Pipeline Route
Subsequent to the 2016 completion of the pedestrian survey for archaeological resources and
the reconnaissance survey for historic resources and also following development of this report
in draft form, in 2017 SRA made several minor adjustments to the final centerline. These are
depicted in Figures 7 and 8. The final alignment very closely parallels the original alignment.
Along much of the route, the final alignment is congruent, or very nearly so, with the original
alignment. Along other portions, the final alignment is typically about 35 m (120 ft) from
the original alignment. The maximum distance between the original alignment and the final
alignment is about 70 m (230 ft). Where the final alignment is outside the corridor that was
archaeologically surveyed in 2016, no supplementary field survey is warranted because of
the complete lack of archaeological resources along the surveyed corridor (see Chapter 6). In
addition, no additional survey for historic resources is warranted because the APE for these
resources wholly encompasses the final alignment.

Results
6.1

Archeological Survey

AmaTerra archeologists Katherine Seikel, Noel Steinle, Jeffrey DeHerrera, and Sam BrighamMcLellan surveyed the Project Area through visual inspection and shovel testing. They found
the terrain to be largely flat and wooded (Figure 9), with the exception of timbered parcels
and clear-cut powerline or pipeline ROWs which crossed the APE (Figures 10 and 11). In
timbered areas vegetation typically included shrubs, grasses, and green briar with scattered
trees (Figure 12). Much of the project area is characterized by low-lying areas which are either
occasionally flooded or are adjacent to intermittently dry drainages.

Figure 12. Overview of timbered
area from NS-22 (facing north).

Investigators had access to 96 percent project area, and surveyed all accessible areas of the
APE. The visual survey included a walkover inspection of the ground surface within the ROW,
and photo-documentation of swampy and disturbed areas located along the proposed route.
High frequencies of modern trash and recent debris were observed within the ROW east of
SH 87 where the pipeline route is adjacent to houses or other structures (Figure 13). A Sanka
Coffee can, with a logo used between 1960–1979, was the only item for which a relative date
could be determined (Figure 14). Some of the other debris likely also dates to the 1960s and
1970s, but nothing of identifiable historic-age was present within the project area.
In addition to the visual inspection, archeologists excavated 133 shovel tests in order to evaluate
the APE for the presence of subsurface archeological deposits. Locations of test are depicted
in Appendix A. Due to the presence of marshes or swampy areas (Figure 15), and disturbed
areas, only 77 percent of the project area was shovel tested. Surface visibility ranged from poor
in areas overgrown with grasses and shrubs to good, particularly in heavily wooded areas.

A typical soil profile in undisturbed areas of the APE consisted of a light yellow-grey or tan
(10YR7/3 or 10YR6/2) sand or silty sand overlying an orange-tan or orange (7.5YR7/6 or
10YR6/6) clay (often mottled with a grey-tan [7.5YR7/1] clay), with a transition layer of
tan or orange-tan (10YR7/2, 10YR8/8 or 10YR6/6) sandy clay between (Appendix B). In
undisturbed contexts, which were not located in areas which frequently flood, shovel tests
terminated between 70–80 cmbs. Shovel tests located in ephemeral basins or drainages tended
to terminate between 15–45 cmbs. In disturbed areas soils were typically mottled sands and/
or silty or sandy clays. Shovel tests were typically terminated around 30–40 cmbs in disturbed
areas. All shovel tests were negative and no cultural materials were observed.
Trenching had been provisionally proposed for the project, particularly near the Sabine River.
However, pedestrian survey determined that trenching was not warranted due to disturbance
of soils from past construction adjacent to the Sabine River, and the sparse, scattered, and
prevailingly inundated nature of deep soil deposits elsewhere in the APE.
The archeological survey documented that no archeological resources greater than 50 years old
are present in the Project Area.
Assessment of 2017 Changes to Pipeline Alignment
Subsequent to the completion of the pedestrian survey in 2016, the pipeline was slightly realigned
for engineering reasons (see Section 5.3). In all cases the final alignment closely parallels
the surveyed corridor. No additional survey is warranted because the lack of archaeological
remains within the surveyed corridor may be confidently extrapolated to the final alignment
(See Figures A1- A 7)

6.2 	Historic-Age Resources Survey
The historic resources field survey and subsequent research identified 20 historic-age properties
within the project’s APE. These included one agricultural property, three commercial properties,
fourteen residential properties, one religious property and one transportation property. Locations
of properties are depicted in Figure 16. The 20 properties are summarized in tabular form in
Appendix C and are fully described and photo-documented in Appendix D.

6.2.1 Agricultural Resources
Agricultural resources include a variety of buildings, objects, and structures with varying
roles in the production of crops and livestock. The form of individual elements, as well as
the arrangement of the buildings, fields, fence lines, and vehicular access, often reflects the
type of farming or ranching originally practiced. Agricultural resources may be eligible under
Criterion A if they have known associations with a historic event, trend, or ethnic group, or
under Criterion B for association with a significant person or family. To be considered eligible
in the area of Agriculture, they must show a clear association with historic agricultural methods
and retain sufficient integrity to convey how such methods were used. Agricultural resources
are usually evaluated under Criterion C for the architecture of the primary residence or building.

An irrigation system is a singular structure composed of a mix of separate, inter-operating
components all designed to deliver water from a source to agricultural fields, commonly in
arid environments or locations without a stable water supply near arable farmland. Although
utilitarian in style, some components of an irrigation system (buildings, primarily) may have
architectural merit in addition to engineering merit. Character-defining features of irrigation
systems include a pump house or diversion structure at the source, primary canals, lateral
canals, check dams, control gates, standpipes, valves, and drains. Canals may be earthen,
concrete-lined, or fully encased in underground pipes. Due to the nature of irrigation systems
and the need for water conservation, they are commonly upgraded with new technology that
may not retain historic integrity. Irrigation systems are treated as an entire system rather than
a mix of singular components; while it is generally not feasible to examine the entire extent
of a system outside of the project APE, a general feel for the overall integrity of the system is
necessary to adequately evaluate it based on irrigation features identified in the APE. Irrigation
systems are most commonly considered under Criterion A for their role in agriculture, but
may also be considered under Criterion B if the builder was of sufficient prominence, and
under Criterion C if the historic components of the system are intact or if it involved the use of
unusual, experimental, or ground-breaking technology with sufficient integrity to exhibit the
technique(s).
Survey efforts identified one agricultural properties in the project APE, Map ID #1, the Gulf
Coast Canal which is part of the John W. Simmons Gulf Coast Canal System. The 75-mile long
canal system was originally constructed in the 1930s by the Orange County Water Company
and used to provide raw water to industries, a municipality, rice farmers and crawfish producers.
The SRA purchased the system in 1954. It is currently used primarily to provide water to
municipalities and industries, such as petrochemical plants, a pulp and paper mill, a steel plant,
and an electrical generating station. It also provides water for rice irrigation, crawfish and
catfish farming, and other miscellaneous uses. (SRA, 2012: 22; SRA: n.d.). The main canal is
approximately 30 miles long and has over 45 miles of lateral canals (AECOM, 2009: 6). It was
named the John W. Simmons Gulf Coast Canal System in 2002. Simmons was the first general
manager and later the executive vice president of SRA, which was created in 1949 (SRA,
2012: 21). Figure 17 shows a map of the system.
Unlike the canal systems in Hidalgo and El Paso Counties, the canal system did not transform
the economy in Orange County allowing for agriculture in otherwise dry climates. It has had
a variety of uses including industrial, agricultural, and municipal. Therefore, the Gulf Coast
Canal (Map I.D. #1) is recommended as not eligible under Criterion A.
Little is known about John W. Simmons other than the fact that he served as the first general
manager of the SRA. The SRA has five administrative units, the Gulf Coast Division being
only one of the larger organization. Although named for John W. Simmons as an honorary
gesture, the canal system would not be where he worked and contributed to the SRA. The lack
of information on Simmons’s historical significance and the fact that he would have performed
his duties at the main office, prohibits the Gulf Coast Canal (Map I.D. #1) from being eligible
under Criterion B.

28

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 6

Figure 17. Map of John W. Simmons Gulf Coast Canal System.

The canal is an unlined canal and not itself architecturally significant. Therefore it is
recommended as not eligible under Criterion C. The 1934 pump house that will be replaced by
the proposed project was out of the APE for this survey. It is a simple, metal utilitarian building
located east of the Gulf Coast Canal on Owens Illinois Road. It will remain standing after it has
been replaced by the pump station on SH 12.

6.2.2 Commercial Resources
Generally, a commercial building is any resource originally built for commercial purposes. The
earliest examples and densest concentrations are found in urban settings, typically in central
locations, such as downtowns where they form one and two part commercial blocks. However,
other examples of this property type are also found in suburban settings, along principal
roadways, at major street/road intersections, or at other hubs of activity. They may be single
buildings housing one or two businesses, or large structures supporting dozens of separate
commercial enterprises. Later examples often include ample off-street parking in front of or
even surrounding the building(s); by the mid-century, parking lots became a primary feature
of strip malls, shopping malls, and freestanding commercial buildings. Although the category
includes resources used for a variety of purposes and with differing physical characteristics,
all buildings in this category were built for commerce and trade. Like domestic residences,
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

29

Cultural Resource Survey of the Sabine River Authority’s Sabine River Pump Station and Pipeline,
Orange and Newton Counties, Texas

commercial buildings may have an identifiable architectural style or they may be utilitarian,
vernacular, or of no style. Vernacular commercial buildings often borrow heavily from local
sources for inspiration; they may be functional or whimsical in appearance.
A commercial building can be eligible for NRHP listing under Criterion C if it was constructed
in or prior to 1973 and it retains a significant amount of its architectural integrity; i.e., it should
appear almost exactly as it did at the time of construction or when it was sympathetically altered
in or prior to the historic cutoff date. Significant additions and unsympathetic alterations, such
as inappropriate storefront modifications, diminish the building’s architectural integrity and
make it not eligible for NRHP listing. In addition, a commercial building should be clearly
associated with one of the significant historic themes listed above. Buildings eligible under
Criterion A or B should have strong historical associations, but can be altered and do not even
have to be particularly noteworthy examples of an architectural style, form, or type.
Survey efforts identified three commercial properties in the project APE, Map ID #2, #3, and
#4A. None of them are particularly noteworthy for their architecture under Criterion C. They
have no known association with important historic events, trends, or persons under Criteria A
or B. As such, they are recommended Not Eligible for listing in the NRHP.

6.2.3 Residential Properties
Fourteen of the properties identified by the survey are residential properties. Residential
properties are often the most common building type encountered during a survey. Most are
single-family houses, but residential resources may also include multi-family dwellings such
as duplexes, townhomes, condominiums, and apartment buildings. Style and form vary greatly
depending on time, period, and region. Prior to the advent of the railroad, regional differences
were far more pronounced, but as transportation and communication methods improved in the
late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, national style trends such as Queen Anne and bungalows
became standard. The years following World War II saw the greatest homogenization of
suburban housing stock, as developers undertook building projects en masse to counteract a
housing shortage and to fuel the “American Dream” of home ownership.
A domestic building can be eligible for NRHP listing under Criterion C if it was constructed in
or prior to 1973 and it retains a significant amount of its architectural integrity; i.e., it should
appear much as it did at the time of construction or when it was sympathetically altered in or
prior to the historic survey cut-off date. Significant additions and unsympathetic alterations,
such as the application of synthetic siding, replacement of original wood porch supports with
metal, and the replacement of wood-sash or steel casement windows with aluminum units,
diminish the building’s architectural integrity and make it ineligible for NRHP listing. In
addition, a domestic building should be clearly associated with one of the significant historic
themes listed above. Buildings eligible under Criteria A or B should have strong historical
associations, but can be altered, and do not even have to be particularly noteworthy examples
of an architectural style, form, or type.

Ranch Houses
The Ranch Style (American Ranch, Western Ranch, or California Rambler) originated in the
early-1930s in California, loosely following the Spanish Colonial precedents in California
filtered through Craftsman bungalow and Prairie house styles that had been widely popular
earlier in the twentieth century. The style remained largely confined to California until after
World War II. A combination of factors led to the popularity of the Ranch Style in its heyday
of the 1950s and 1960s: the demand for single-family housing by World War II vets starting
families; the GI Bill, which provided many different types of loans for returning veterans to
buy homes; an increase in automobile ownership, which freed workers from the need to live
close to public transportation routes; and the strict FHA-VA guidelines under which developers
operated in order to be able to market the houses to buyers using FHA and VA governmentsubsidized mortgages (McAlester, 1984: 479).
Characteristics of Ranch houses include an emphasis on a horizontal and low-slung profile
parallel to the street, asymmetrical facades, a low pitched gabled or hipped roof with large
overhangs, large windows, an attached garage, and relatively simple rectangular, L-, or
U-shaped plans. Exterior materials included brick, stone, and wood, with generally minimal
decorative detailing. Front and back porches are common and vary in size (Craven, 2011).
Many Ranch houses were designed en masse for quick construction, but may display additional
unique detailing shared by others in their immediate vicinity. High style examples exist, but
most are confined to California or large urban areas.
Survey efforts identified two Ranch style house, Map I.D. #7 and #8A. They are both of common
building stock. They do not share a particular design aesthetic beyond basic adherence to the
Ranch Style. They are one-story, wood-frame buildings on slab foundations built in 1970.
They are basic, with minimal detailing. They are not part of post-war subdivisions. They were
both damaged in the March 2016 flood of Deweyville. Although modifications are minimal
and include replacement on windows and siding, they are uninspired examples of the Ranch
style and do not rise to a level of significance required under Criterion C. They have no known
association with important historic events, trends, or persons under Criteria A or B and are
recommended as Not Eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Other Styles and Mixed-Style Houses
Some houses noted during reconnaissance-level surveys have no discernable style. These
“cottages” are generally simple massed rectangular plan buildings with a side or cross-gabled
roof and minimal detailing. Some architectural embellishments include exposed rafter ends,
multi-light windows, and small inset porches. Most have shallow to moderate eaves, with
simple roof forms lacking dormers or other architectural stylistic features. Siding tends to be
modern, with a different material under the gable ends of the roofs for variation. “Mixed” is a
term used by the NRHP to define a building with several architectural styles or influences, but
with no one style dominating.

Map I.D. #5, #6, #9A, #11A, #12, #13, #14, #16, #17, #18A, #19 and #20, are classified as
having no discernable style. The majority have undergone flood damage due to the March
2016 Deweyville flood. None of them are particularly noteworthy for their architecture under
Criterion C. They have no known association with important historic events, trends, or persons
under Criteria A or B. As such, they are recommended Not Eligible for listing in the NRHP.

6.2.4 Religious Resources
NRHP Criteria Consideration A requires that religious properties require justification on
architectural, artistic, or historic grounds to avoid any appearance of judgment by government
about the validity of any religion or belief. Historic significance for a religious property cannot
be established on the merits of a religious doctrine, but rather, for architectural or artistic values
or for important historic or cultural forces that the property represents. A religious property’s
significance under Criterion A, B, C, or D must be judged in purely secular terms. A religious
group may, in some cases, be considered a cultural group whose activities are significant in
areas broader than religious history.
A religious property can be eligible under Criterion A for any of three reasons:
•
•
•

It is significant under a theme in the history of religion having secular scholarly recognition;
or
It is significant under another historical theme, such as exploration, settlement, social
philanthropy, or education; or
It is significantly associated with traditional cultural values.

Also, buildings eligible under Criterion A or B do not have to be unaltered or even particularly
noteworthy examples of an architectural style, form, or type. It is not necessary for a property
to retain all its historic physical features or characteristics. The property must retain, however,
the essential physical features that enable it to convey its historic identity. There is one religious
property in the Study Area: Map I.D. #10A. The Deweyville First United Methodist Church
building is not known to be associated with a significant historical event, or associated with a
person of transcendent importance, nor does it embody the distinctive characteristics of a type,
period, or method of construction, or that represents the work of a master. It has undergone
minor alterations, such as a ramp addition, and has suffered interior flood damage. Therefore,
it is recommended as not eligible for NRHP listing under Criteria A, B or C.

6.2.5 Transportation Resources
There is one transportation resource within the project area: Map I.D. #15A, the Deweyville
Swing Bridge. This bridge was listed in the NRHP in 2011 under Criteria A and C. Built from
1936 to 1938, the 327-foot bridge replaced a ferry to provide a connection between Texas and
Louisiana across the Sabine River. It was engineered by the Louisiana Highway Commission
and built by the contractors Forcum-James. Since its listing in 2011, the bridge retains its
integrity from its period of significance from the 1930s. No changes to its listed status are
recommended.

Map I.D. #15B is mentioned in the NRHP nomination as a centennial marker marking the
entry point in to Texas. It is not listed as contributing to the bridge, but is recommended as
a contributing feature of the bridge. Previous coordination on other projects for the Texas
Department of Transportation has resulted in a blanket determination that these markers are
also individually eligible for NRHP listing.
Map I.D. #15C is a bronze NRHP plaque erected after the nomination was accepted in 2011. It
is recommended as not contributing.

Conclusions and Recommendations
7.1

Archeological Resources

On July 11–14, 2016, AmaTerra surveyed the proposed route of the Sabine River Authority’s
Sabine River pump station and pipeline in Orange and Newton Counties, Texas. The project
was conducted under the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA and all work conformed to the
guidelines for implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26, as well as 36
CFR 800. Because the proposed project may require individual permits or preconstruction
notifications under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act, all work was compliant with Section 106 review standards.
AmaTerra archeologists conducted an intensive archeological survey of the proposed SRA’s
Sabine River pump station and pipeline. Ninety-six percent of the corridor was inspected by
pedestrian survey and 77 percent of the corridor was shovel tested, with 133 shovel tests being
excavated. The visual inspection revealed a landscape that had been impacted by intermittent
flooding and heavily impacted in some locations by timbering. Shovel testing revealed sandy
and sandy clay soils throughout much of the project area. Mottling and the compacting of
soils due to the intermittent presence of standing water was common in many locations
within the project area. Shovel tests were distributed to confirm disturbance in timbered areas
and to identify the possibility of intact soils. Backhoe trenching was not conducted due to
disturbances and the presence of shallow soils throughout the project area. No cultural material
was encountered during shovel testing, and no surface finds of historic age were identified.
No archeological deposits were encountered, and no sites were recorded during the survey.
The proposed undertaking would have no effect on significant archeological resources and
AmaTerra recommends no further archeological investigations.
In the unlikely event that construction activities should contact significant archeological
deposits in areas already surveyed, all work in the vicinity should cease until such time as those
materials can be evaluated by a professional archeologist and the results of that evaluation are
reported to the THC.
This report is submitted in fulfillment of Antiquities Permit No. 7597. No artifacts were
collected during this survey. All documents and photographs generated during fieldwork for
this project will be curated at TARL.

7.2	Historic Resources
On May 9, 2016, AmaTerra historians, conducted a reconnaissance-level survey for the
proposed Sabine River pump station and pipeline in Orange and Newton Counties, Texas. The
survey identified and evaluated 20 historic-age resources. One resource, the Deweyville Swing
Bridge, is listed in the NRHP. No other resources are recommended as eligible for NRHP
listing.

Orange and Newton Counties, Texas

The Deweyville Swing is listed in the NRHP under Criteria A and C for Engineering and
Transportation. Because the proposed construction will be confined to over 500 feet away
for the pipeline and over 200 feet away for the pump station, the aspects of location, design,
materials and workmanship will not be affected. The remaining three aspects of integrity—
setting, feeling, and association—are more subjective so each is discussed below in greater
detail.
Setting refers to the character of the place where the historic resource is located. It includes
natural and man-made features and how those features relate to the resource. Examples include
buildings, dependencies, roads, paths, fences, open spaces, topographical characteristics, and
view sheds. For a resource to have integrity of setting, it should retain the majority of the
significant landscape features that it had during the period of significance. The Deweyville
Swing Bridge’s period of significance is 1936–1938. The current setting for the bridge is the
Sabine River and as it enters Texas, a parking lot and boat ramp are located to the southwest
adjacent to the pump house site and a forested area is located to the northwest. The construction
of the underground pipeline would have no effect on the setting, but the construction of the
pump house would affect the current view shed of the Deweyville Swing Bridge and the Texas
Centennial Marker. As such visual intrusions already exist, however, the new pump house
would not constitute an indirect effect. Consequently, this would not diminish the integrity of
setting.
Feeling is “a property’s expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of
time.” To have integrity of feeling, a building or structure must have surviving physical features
that express its historic character and help the observer experience awareness of its history and
importance. The Deweyville Swing Bridge retains the features that make it eligible for NRHP
listing, and the pump house and pipeline would have on effect on the integrity of feeling.
Association is defined by the National Register as “the direct link between an important historic
event or person and a historic property.” Integrity of association relies on two factors. First,
the site must be the actual place where something significant happened. A property that is
significant for its historic association is eligible if it retains the essential physical features that
made up its character or appearance during the period of its association with the important
event, historical pattern, or person(s). The Deweyville Swing Bridge and the Texas Centennial
Marker retain the character-defining physical features they possessed during their periods of
significance and (with the bridge) in 2011 when it was listed in the NRHP.
Adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the
characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the National
Register in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property’s location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. Because the proposed undertaking
would not diminish the integrity of the Deweyville Swing Bridge and the Texas Centennial
Marker, impair its ability to convey significance, or introduce substantial direct or indirect
effects, a finding of no adverse effect is recommended.

INTEGRITY/ COMMENTS
Gulf Coast Canal owned by
the SRA was purchased in
1954 from the Orange County
Water Company. The canal
system originally provided
raw water to industries, a
municipality, rice farmers and
crawfish producers in Orange
County. Currently, the canal
system provides water to
industrial and municipal
customers and some crawfish
and rice farmers. This would
be the terminus of the newly
constructed pipeline/ canal. It
was named the John W.
Simmons Gulf Coast Canal
System in 2002.
Hurricanes Rita and Ike
destroyed the store, but the
owners rebuilt it each time
using the original materials.
