ABSTRACT

AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an archaeological survey of the proposed
Wyatt Earp Federal #1H Well Pad Site and approximately 1,500 feet of
associated pipeline route located on United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service land, LBJ National Grasslands
approximately 6 miles northeast of Alvord in Wise County, Texas. The
proposed pipeline route begins at CR 900a and runs southwest and
terminates at the proposed well pad site. The survey was conducted for
KBA EnviroSciences, Ltd. which is doing the environmental permitting
for Aspen Operating Company, LLC. No cultural materials were seen on
the ground surface during a comprehensive pedestrian archaeological
survey or encountered in ten shovel tests.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further archaeological investigations are unwarranted
within the proposed pipeline route and well pad site. We further
recommend that if buried archaeological materials are uncovered during
construction, work should immediately cease in that area and the Texas
Historical Commission and the USDA Forest Service should be notified.
Work should not continue until discussions with the above agencies have
been completed.

INTRODUCTION
In early July 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological
survey of the proposed Wyatt Earp Federal Gas Well #1 and associated pipeline route
which is located approximately 6.34 miles slightly northeast of Alvord in Wise County,
Texas. The proposed well pad site’s dimensions are 230x175 feet and the pipeline route
is approximately 1,500 feet long with a 50 feet right-of-way. The proposed well pad site
is located approximately 1.49 miles northwest of CR 2461 and about 2.4 miles southwest
of CR 2560 LBJ Grasslands (Figure 1). The survey was conducted for KBA
EnviroSciences, Ltd. which is doing the environmental permitting for Aspen Operating
Company, LLC.
The archaeological survey was done at the request of the United States Department of
Agriculture Forest Service in a letter dated May 23, 2007. The purpose of the survey was
to determine if cultural materials were present, make recommendations about their
significance and how they might be impacted by the construction. Since the United States
Department of Agriculture, Forest Service is the land owner, relevant federal legislation
includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and
Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291). This report has been
prepared following the guideline outlined by the Council of Texas Archeologists (ND).

NATURAL SETTING
The proposed pipeline route is included in the Western Cross Timbers vegetative area
which runs through the northern portion of Wise County. Water from the study area
drains into Denton Creek (Ressel 1989:1). The well pad site and pipeline route lie within
the Texan Biotic Province which contains at least 49 mammal species, 39 snake species
and 17 species of reptiles and amphibians. Common forms of fauna include deer,
raccoon, opossum, rabbit, lizards and turtles (Blair 1950:101-102).
The soil association is Duffau-Keefer-Weatherford which consist of gently sloping to
sloping upland sands and loams (Ressel 1989:General Soils Map). The Lower
Cretaceous-aged Paluxy Formation is the source bed for the soils (Ressel 1989:123). The
specific soil that the well pad site and pipeline route are to be constructed on is the
Weatherford-Duffau complex with 3 to 8 percent slopes (Ressel 1989:Sheet 12). The
deepest subsoil is the Duffau which is listed as 16 inches (40 cm) below the ground
surface (Ressel 1989:97).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to the survey, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007) was consulted for sites
listed that were in or adjacent to the proposed gas pipeline route. No upland (or Uvalde)
gravels are mapped by the Bureau of Economic Geology (1967). Studies in Wise County
by Jurney, Winchell and Moir (1989) within the grasslands indicate that the
archaeological potential is low along intermittent drainages, but higher where perennial
water is present such as major streams and springs.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Based upon the results of archaeological surveys in Wise County, it was presumed that
prehistoric sites would not be found in the upland situation where no perennial water is
present. Prehistoric sites have been recorded further east along Denton Creek where
perennial water is present. Historic sites were not expected to be present due to the
distance from roadways,

METHODOLOGY
After a discussion with Mr. John Ippilito of the USDA Forest Service, shovel tests were
excavated every 100 m along the proposed pipeline route and five (5) shovel tests were
excavated within the well pad site. Due to the upland setting, shovel tests were excavated
to approximately 35 cm below the ground surface. The sandy loam was screened through
a 1/4-inch hardwire screen and the pit walls were inspected visually for cultural materials.
The proposed pipeline route was walked by the archaeologists spaced 10 m apart in a
general southwest direction and the well pad site was investigated using northeastsouthwest oriented transects spaced 15 m apart. Notes on the terrain, vegetation and other
relevant information were taken as were photographs. Deep testing was unnecessary due
to the upland nature of the terrain where no alluvium was present and the shallow depth
to the subsoil.

RESULTS
In this portion of the report the survey is presented. The study area is discussed first and
is followed by a description of the survey area. Shovel tests are described generally in the
text and specific information can be found in Table 1. Shovel test locations plotted on
Figure 4.
The study area
From CR 900A, the land slopes rather steeply for about 150 m and then becomes
undulating. The proposed pipeline route is to be constructed across unimproved pasture
and the well pad site is in forest/grassland savannah. Understory vegetation includes
broomweed, black-eyed susans, beggar’s lice, puffweed, blood bush and native grasses
and bushes. Trees consist of hackberry, oak and eastern red cedar. Ground visibility was

less than 10 percent for the first 125 m of the proposed pipeline route (Figure 2) and then
was at least 70 percent for the rest of the route (Figure 3). Ground visibility in the
savannah area for the well pad site was at least 30 percent. Eye-height visibility was
excellent along the proposed trail and at least 50 m in the savannah portion of the study
area.
The survey
Shovel tests 1 through 5 were placed along the proposed pipeline route which is adjacent
to a fence line. Shovel test (hereafter ST) 1 was placed approximately 20 m southwest of
CR 900A and uncovered 9 cm of sandy loam overlying sandy clay subsoil that extended
to 33 cm below the ground surface. Shovel test 2 encountered 10 cm of sandy loam
overlying 20 cm of sandy clay subsoil which overlaid a different sandy clay to 35 cm
below the ground surface. Sandy loam was encountered in STs 3, 4 and 5 at 33, 35 and
36, respectively. The shovel tests were culturally sterile and no cultural materials older
than 50 years were seen on the ground surface during the archaeological survey of the
proposed pipeline route.
Shovel test 6 was placed at the northeast corner of the well pad site and uncovered 36 cm
of sand whereas ST 7, which was placed in the southeast corner, encountered 38 cm of
sandy clay subsoil. Shovel test 8 was placed where the well bore is to be and uncovered
15 cm of sandy loam overlying very fine sand subsoil. Shovel test 9 was placed in the
northwest corner of the proposed well pad site and encountered 15 cm of sandy loam
overlying sand subsoil. The last shovel test, ST 10, was excavated in the southwest corner
and uncovered 36 cm of sandy clay subsoil. Note that STs 7 and 10 encountered subsoil
on the ground surface. No cultural materials older than fifty years were seen on the
ground surface or uncovered in the five shovel tests within the proposed well pad site.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
No cultural materials older than fifty years were seen on the ground surface despite the
good ground visibility or uncovered in the 10 shovel tests excavated within the study
area. The absence of prehistoric sites is probably due to the lack of perennial water. The
fact that no knappable lithic materials were present also may have played a role in the
absence of prehistoric sites. No historic sites were expected to be present and none were
found, probably due to the distance of the well pad site from a roadway.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further archaeological investigations are unwarranted within the proposed pipeline route
and well pad site. We further recommend that if buried archaeological materials are
uncovered during construction, work should immediately cease in that area and the Texas
Historical Commission and the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service
should be notified. Work should not continue until discussions with the above agencies
have been completed.
