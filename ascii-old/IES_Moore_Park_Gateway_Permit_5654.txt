ABSTRACT

In April of 2010, MESA Design Associates, Inc. contracted Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC to perform cultural resources services for
the proposed Moore Park Gateway Construction along Cedar Creek for the
City of Dallas, Dallas County, Texas. A cultural resources survey was
conducted to evaluate if archaeological sites and/or historic properties will
be impacted by the proposed construction. A series of four backhoe
trenches and two backhoe scrapes were dug and inspected and a full
pedestrian survey with shovel testing and visual inspection of the cut
banks and erosional features was employed. No cultural resources were
identified. Due to the negative results of the survey, Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC recommends that no further studies are
necessary and that the proposed Moore Park Gateway construction by
MESA Design Associates Inc. for the City of Dallas shall proceed.

INTRODUCTION
MESA Design Associates Inc., on behalf of the City of Dallas, proposes to construct
Moore Park Gateway, adjacent to Cedar Creek in Dallas, Dallas County, Texas. Cedar
Creek is a tributary to the Trinity River. The project area is located northeast of the
intersection of East 8th Street and Rockefeller Boulevard, south of the Dallas Area Rapid
Transit (DART) Rail (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed project consists of expansion of
the existing DART parking area, a concrete pavilion, and a sky bridge across Cedar
Creek to connect to an existing parking lot. Additionally, two borrow pits will be
excavated to provide fill for the main site area. One borrow pit (see Borrow Pit 2,
Figure 1) has already been tested under Antiquities Permit Number 4214. MESA Design
Associates Inc. (MESA) contracted Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) to
perform cultural resources services for this project. A cultural resources survey was
conducted to determine if archaeological sites and/or historic properties would be
impacted by this proposed construction.
This survey was necessitated to comply with the requirements of the Antiquities Code of
Texas because the site is located on public property, owned by the City of Dallas, and the
improvements will disturb more than five acres and/or 5,000 cubic yards for excavation
and/or fill material. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5654 was issued for the
archaeological survey. The purpose of this survey was to locate any cultural resources
and make recommendations about their significance and how they might be impacted by
the proposed construction.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (2002). The report presents a brief description of the
project area, the natural environment and cultural history of the study area followed by a
description of the research design and the methodology. The results of the investigations
and recommendations to proceed with construction follow with a list of references cited
concluding the report.

SITE OVERVIEW
The proposed project will take place in the approximately 3.3 acre main site area situated
north of Cedar Creek and east of East 8th Street and will utilize excavated material from
two borrow pits (see Figure 1). One of the borrow pits (see Borrow Pit 2, Figure 1),
approximately 1.7 acres in size, is located closer to the Trinity River on the northeast side
of Cedar Creek. This borrow pit was previously tested under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4214 and therefore was not tested during this survey. The other borrow pit (see
Borrow Pit 1, Figure 1) is approximately one acre is size and is located on the northeast
corner of East 8th Street and Rockefeller Boulevard, just south of Cedar Creek. These
two pits will provide fill material to build up the main site area and provide an even
surface for the proposed DART parking lot expansion and concrete pavilion construction.
Figures 3 and 4 depict an overview of the entire area and a more detailed view of the
main site area respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Dallas County has a humid subtropical climate and averages 33.3 inches of rain yearly
(City of Dallas 2010). The rainfall is distributed throughout the year peaking in Spring
and Fall especially in the months of May and October (City of Dallas 2010). Average
annual temperatures range from 36 to 96 degrees F, but temperatures can drop to several
degrees below freezing in the winter and get up to several degrees over 100 in the
Summer (City of Dallas 2010).
Hill (1887) was the first to note the relationship of geologic formations to the
physiographic regions of North Central Texas. Dallas County lies in the Blackland
Prairie of Texas. This prairie occurs over the outcrops of Upper Cretaceous Eagle Ford
Shale, Austin Chalk, and Ozan Marl (Ferring and Yates 1998). The Austin Chalk is more
resistant to erosion than the Eagle Ford and Ozan formations that bound it (Ferring and
Yates 1998). The main site area and borrow pit just south of Cedar Creek (Figure 1) lie
atop the boundary of the Austin Chalk and Quaternary Alluvium from the Trinity River
while the previously tested borrow pit is underlain entirely by the Trinity River
Quaternary Alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). The soils at the proposed
location are Frio-Urban land complex with the northern portion of the main site area in
Eddy-Urban land complex and the southern portion of the borrow pit south of Cedar
Creek in Ferris-Urban land complex (Coffee et al. 1980). These soils support a mixed
grass prairie system with some oak and cedar along drainages. Generally, the relief is

gently rolling with few streams, except for those through flowing streams with
headwaters to the west (Hill 1901).

REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Evidence of prehistoric occupation in this region begins in the Paleoindian period,
roughly from 11,500 to 8,500 years ago. Sites of this age are limited mainly to surface
finds of Clovis, Dalton, Plainview, Midland, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff projectile point
types (Prikryl 1990). The one exception is the Aubrey Clovis site, 41DN479, a deeply
buried in situ floodplain site that is well dated to 11,550 before present (BP) (Ferring
2000). The Paleoindian period is characterized as a period of low population density,
high mobility, and a generalized hunting and gathering economy. The majority of sites
(ca. 68 percent) are located on tributary terraces to major rivers (Prikryl 1990).
The Early Archaic cultures, 8,500 to 6,000 BP, shared many characteristics with the
Paleoindian cultures that preceded them. They are also recognized by surface collections
with the most diagnostic projectile points being Angostura and Early Split-Stemmed. A
continuation of a generalized hunting and gathering economy is assumed for the Early
Archaic with a shift to grasslands and wetter climates (Ferring 1995, Prikryl 1987).
The Middle Archaic, 6,000 to 3,500 BP, is a time of reduced populations in response to
harsh climatic conditions of the Altithermal as proposed by Antevs (1955). Artifacts for
this period are rare with Frio, Trinity, Carrollton, and Wells being the most common
(Prikryl 1990). The faunal record reflects a higher percentage of small game, perhaps
reflecting a paucity of large game animals as a result of drier conditions.
The Late Archaic, 3,500 to 1,250 BP, is a period of increased site densities suggesting
that populations expanded with an environmental change to a wetter environment.
Surface collections contain two to three times more Late Archaic projectile points that
any other archaeological period (Prikryl 1990). Evidence of intensive exploitation of
bottomland resources, use of regional raw materials, and abundant faunal remains from
Late Archaic sites supports the interpretation of a population explosion during this period
(Story 1981, Lynott 1981, Ferring and Yates 1997, 1998).
The Late Prehistoric period, 1,250 to 350 BP, was a period of technological innovation
that included ceramics, bow and arrow, houses, and storage features. Maize made its first
appearance in the region as evidenced by the Cobb Pool site, 41DL148, (Peter and
McGregor 1988). Several attempts have been made to divide the Late Prehistoric into
early and late phases based on climatic change, ceramics, and arrow typologies (Lynott
1977, Prikryl 1990). However, the number of sites with discrete assemblages is very
small and surface sites yield mixed assemblages preventing a definitive division of the
Late Prehistoric period.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Several block surveys have been conducted in the surrounding area. In fact, one very
large area survey was conducted in 1981 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers â Fort
Worth District (USACE-FW) that is adjacent to the proposed project area along Cedar
Creek and extends through portions of the Trinity River floodway (Texas Archaeological
Sites Atlas [TASA] 2010). During this survey, the historic house site 41DL220 was

identified which is located approximately 1,050 meters east of the project area (TASA
2010). Additionally, a survey was conducted in 1996 by AR Consultants for the City of
Dallas within the Trinity River floodway north of the Santa Fe Rail (TASA 2010). Two
historic dump sites (41DL370 and 41DL371) were identified during this survey and are
located approximately 1,450 meters and 1,250 meters northwest of the proposed project
area, respectively (TASA 2010). Additionally, in 2009, a survey was conducted by C
Dimensions approximately 400 meters west of the project area, but no cultural resources
were identified (TASA 2010). As previously discussed, the borrow pit on the northeast
side of Cedar Creek near the Trinity River (see Figure 1) was surveyed in 2006 by Lopez
Garcia Group under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4214, but no cultural resources
were identified (TASA 2010).
In addition to block surveys conducted, other archaeological sites have been identified in
the surrounding area. In 1991, AR Consultants identified a historic dump site (41DL320)
approximately 1300 meters northeast of the project area, and in 1992 they located another
historic dump site (41DL347) approximately 620 meters west of the project area (TASA
2010). In 2002, the Dallas Archaeological Society documented the historic Santa Fe
Bridge site number 41DL414 which crosses the Trinity River approximately 900 meters
north northeast of the project area (TASA 2010). Also, another historic house site
number 41DL494 was discovered in 2009 by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) approximately 375 meters southwest of the project area (TASA
2010).

METHODOLOGY
Prior to field work, IES conducted a search on the TASA to determine what cultural
resources have been recorded in the area. Field work included 100 percent pedestrian
survey, shovel tests, a series of four backhoe trenches, two backhoe scrapes, and visual
inspection of the cut banks and erosional features.
The records review indicated no evidence of prehistoric or historic occupation in the
study area. However, buried archaeological sites might be present within the Cedar
Creek flood basin and therefore, the potential for disturbance of cultural remains is
possible with the planned construction for this site. The project area is located primarily
within Quaternary Alluvium, but small segments of Austin Chalk bedrock and colluvium
are present along the western boundary. The Main Site Area construction located on the
north side of the Cedar Creek drainage will utilize terrace construction material fill from
Borrow Pit 1 excavated on the south side of the drainage (see Figure 1). Additional fill
will be obtained from the previously permitted Borrow Pit 2 (see Figure 1). A cultural
resources survey of the Main Site Area and Borrow Pit 1 was conducted to determine if
archaeological sites and/or historic properties would be impacted by the proposed
construction. No structures were shown on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) map in
the study area, but evidence of any occupation feature can be identified by trash scatters,
isolated artifacts, or collapsed structures adjacent to Cedar Creek.
The field team walked the entire Main Site Area and Borrow Pit 1 (see Figure 1) and
made notes about the cut-bank exposures and areas of previous disturbance. Four shovel
tests were excavated in Borrow Pit 1; the shovel tests were 40x40 centimeters to a

minimum depth of 40 centimeters, subsoil, or bedrock. All matrices were screened using
Â¼-inch mesh. To check for deeply buried cultural deposits a review of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil survey and geologic maps of Dallas County were
examined. Soil series in the area consisted of Frio-Urban land complex with silty clays
that are frequently flooded. Based on this review, geoarchaeological exploration of
sediments along the area of impact included the excavation of four backhoe trenches (two
in Borrow Pit 1 and two in the Main Site Area), and an additional two backhoe scrapes to
a depth of 70 centimeters to confirm urban fill of the Main Site Area. Attempts were
made to excavate the trenches to a depth of ca. 3 meters in areas where intact deposits
were located. All sediment removed from trenches was inspected for archaeological or
paleontological materials as the trenches were dug. Trench walls were examined for any
materials or evidence of features, and sediment-soil profile descriptions were made for
each trench. Photographs of each trench profile as well as the survey area were taken
during fieldwork, and detailed notes of all fieldwork were recorded. All trenches were
backfilled following these investigations. The locations of the backhoes were recorded
with a handheld Trimble GeoXT global positioning system (GPS) receiver. Figure 5
shows the location of the backhoe trenches, shovel tests, and water features. Photographs
were taken of the survey area and backhoe trenches using an Olympus Stylus 850 SW 8.0
mega pixel digital camera. Trench profile descriptions are provided in Appendix A and
photographs in Appendix B.

RESULTS
A summary of the backhoe trenches and scrapes is provided in Table 1, and detailed
trench profile descriptions are located in Appendix A. Shovel test results are located in
Table 2. Excavation of the four backhoe trenches (BH1-4), two backhoe scrapes (BH56), and four shovel tests (ST1-4), did not yield any discovery of historic or prehistoric
sites or features. All trenches were within the flood basin of Cedar Creek.
The two trenches dug in the Borrow Pit 1(BH1-2) had recent to late Holocene (ca. 3,500300 years ago) floodplain sediments and soils in the upper sections. The depth of
sediment deposition and soil development indicate a prolonged period of floodplain
stability without extensive channel migration, erosion, or alluvial ridge construction.
Neither trench contained a buried soil.
In contrast, the trenches in the Main Site Area contained urban land fill materials. BH3
contained 3.2 meters of burned trash, wood, bricks, asphalt, fencing wire, and other
construction materials. Similarly, BH4 contained an abundance of urban debris
especially brick and asphalt. All of the bricks were solid, terracotta clay, and some were
inscribed with the word Texas or Dallas; some had a diamond shape in the middle and a
few had star shapes in the middle. Examination of the cutbank demonstrated that the fill
in the Main Site Area was from 8-10 meters in thickness from the channel base. No
buried soil component could be reached with the backhoe or seen in the cutbank. An
additional two backhoe scrapes (BH5-6) were preformed to confirm the extent of
disturbance across the site. These scrapes were examined and photographed but not
described in detail. The first scrape (BH5) was to a depth of 70 centimeters with landfill
materials underlain by bedrock.

The second scrape (BH6) contained an abundance of brick and concrete and was
excavated to a depth of 50 centimeters. Since no intact soils were present, shovel testing
was deferred in the Main Site Area. The entire area appears to have been quarried for
gravels or sediments and then used as a dump site for trash and construction materials.
Many of the fill layers appeared to have been burned before further dumping took place.
Limited shovel testing was conducted only in Borrow Pit 1 due to the small size and the
absence of intact soil in the Main Site Area. Four shovel tests were excavated in Borrow
Pit 1 in conjunction with two backhoe trenches. All the shovel tests were negative for
significant artifacts and only recent broken beer and wine bottles and a few aluminum
pull tabs were noted. The soils were consistent with the Frio urban land complex soil
series of frequently flooded silty clays. One shovel test (ST4) did not have an intact soil
but was backfill from storm drainage construction. A storm drain runs diagonally across
the borrow pit area from the corner of Rockefeller and Ventura to Cedar Creek (Figure
5).
In summary, only Borrow Pit 1 had the potential for archaeological remains; the Main
Site Area contained no intact soils and was composed entirely of urban land fill. In the
borrow pit area, BHT 1 and 2 contained intact floodplain soils with cumulic soils that had
the potential for buried archaeological remains. However, no buried soils were
________________________________________________________________________

encountered and no artifacts or features were found in the trench walls. Additionally,
four shovel tests proved negative and the area has been crosscut by storm drainage
construction. The Main Site Area appears to have been quarried for gravels or sediments
and then used as a dump site for trash and construction materials.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No historic or prehistoric archaeological sites were found during this survey. The area
was intensively surveyed with backhoe trenching, shovel testing and examination of
cutbank exposures. Borrow Pit 1 indicates a remarkable period of floodplain stability and
pedogensis. However, it has been impacted by storm drainage construction and is a quite
limited area (approximately 1 acre). The Main Site Area is best characterized as urban
land fill and is devoid of soils that might contain cultural materials. Since no historic or
prehistoric archaeological sites or features were discovered, no specific adverse impacts
to cultural resources can be identified at this time. It is the recommendation of IES that
MESA Design on behalf of the City of Dallas be permitted to continue with their plans
for the parking and walkway construction Moore Park Gateway without the need for
further cultural resource investigations.
Monitoring during construction is not
recommended but if cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should
immediately cease in that area and IES notified. IES will inform the Archeology
Division of the THC and work to resolve the problem. Work should not continue until
discussions with the proper agency have been concluded.

CURATION OF DATA
All field notes and photographs collected during this project will be permanently curated
at Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) The University of Texas at Austin
1 University Station R7500 Austin, Texas 78712-0714. No artifacts were collected.
