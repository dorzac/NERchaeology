A List of Radiocarbon Dates from
Archeological Sites in Texas
Compiled and edited by

T. N. CAMPBELL

TI-IUS FAR 17 radiocarbon dates have been announced for archeologicaI
sites in the Texas area. A total of 11 sites is involved (see Table 1),
three of which are Neo-American, three are Archaic, and five are
Pateo-American. Most of these sites are represented by one date only;
however, four Paleo-American sites are represented by two or more
dates. Additional radiocarbon dates from these and other sites have
been determined, but these have not yet been announced in print.
The dates in the following list are arranged in reverse chronological
order, beginning with the most recent dates and proceeding backward
in time to the oldest dates. In each case the essential facts are presented
under four headings: (1) sample number and name of laboratory that
produced the date; (2) sample provenience--material of sample,
stratigraphic position, major associations, and culture dated; (3) dating in years before the present and also in terms of the calendar; and
(4) references to published literature. In the last category a distinction
is made between (a) published date lists and (b) archeological publications that interpret and evaluate the dates.
As the earlier literature on Texas radiocarbon dates is widely scattered, this list should be especially convenient for workers in the Texas
field. At present most radiocarbon dating laboratories present their
age determinations annually in a single publication, the American
Journal of Science Badiocarbon Supplement, and dates are much
easier to find.
Two useful radiocarbon bibliographies have appeared recently, one
by Johnson (1959), the other by McNutt and Wheeler (1959). Johnson’s bibliography is broader in scope and therefore more usefu!.
