ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed 1.72-mile water line in southcentral Shelby County, Texas was performed on April 27, 2008 by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) for the Shelbyville Water Supply Corporation
(WSC) under Antiquities Permit 4898. In all, the area comprises 3.13 acres. One
high probability area adjacent to Beauchamp Creek was investigated by shovel
testing. Four shovel tests dug through sandy soil to depths of 80 cm were
negative in terms of producing cultural materials, and no artifacts were collected.
Therefore, it is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as
planned. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC), Archeology Division; Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL);
and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The Shelbyville WSC plans to install 1.72 miles of three inch water line
along County Road 2420 (4400 feet) and Farm-to-Market Road 2694 (4700 feet)
in rural Shelby County, Texas (Figure 1). This project is being funded by the
United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Utilities Services with John Powell
the agency representative. The water line will be placed in a trench with three
feet of cover and seven inches wide. It will be within the existing highway rightof-way as close to the private property line as possible. A pre-survey
assessment identified one area as a likely setting for a prehistoric site. This area
is on the south side of Farm-to-Market Road 2694 and the west bank of
Beauchamp Creek. There is a small level area above the ditch and adjacent to
the fence on private property (Figure 2). The project area is depicted on the
USGS topographic map Shelbyville (3194-441) (Figure 3).
Shelby County is located in a part of Texas that contains numerous
prehistoric and historic sites, many of which have been considered to possess
significant research potential. This county is in the area once inhabited by the
prehistoric Caddo Indians of Northeast Texas. Many of these sites contain
burials and pottery vessels of exceptional quality. Vandalism of archaeological
sites in this area is a serious problem, and the number of intact Caddoan sites is
rapidly decreasing. In fact, one Caddoan site (41SY46) with two mounds is
located nearby. Since house mounds were often associated with mound sites, it
was recommended b the THC that a cultural resources survey be performed by a
professional archaeologist prior to the installation of the water line in all high
probability areas. In order to comply with this request, the Shelbyville WSC
retained BVRA of Bryan, Texas to conduct this investigation.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1946) and the Austropriarian
biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:98-100). The reader is referred to
Volume I (Stratigraphy) of the Geology of Texas by Sellards et al. (1932) for a
more in-depth discussion of the geology of this area. Data taken from the Texas
Almanac for 1984-1985 (Kingston and Harris 1983) state that the county receives
49.94 inches of annual rainfall. When combined with a January minimum
temperature of 38 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of 94
degrees Fahrenheit, a growing season of 240 days results. Fauna known to be
present within the project area at various times of the year include fox and gray
squirrel, armadillo, raccoon, opossum, cottontail rabbits, white-tailed deer,
coyote, beaver, and feral hogs. Many birds utilize the site including dove,
meadowlark, killdeers, various sparrows, great blue herons, bluebirds,
mockingbirds, and cardinals. According to soil data for Shelby County obtained
from the Internet, the project area is located within described as Laneville loam, 0
to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded. The parent material of this soil type is
loamy alluvium. This soil floods often and is described as part of the 100-year
floodplain according to a recent wetlands study by J. F. Fontaine & Associates,
Inc. (report in preparation). In April, the time of this survey, the water saturation
level is at 27 inches (69 cm).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Shbley County is located in the Northeast Texas Cultural-Geographical
Region of Texas as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985) in a planning document
published by the Texas Historical Commission. Shelby County (with 37 recorded
sites in 1985) was 22nd in the region that consists of 30 counties. Of the 37
recorded sites in 1985, 0 are Paleo-Indian, 2 are Late Archaic, 1 is General
Archaic, and 35 are Late Prehistoric. Disturbance to sites in the county is listed
by Biesaart et al. (1985:184) as erosion (n=36), construction (n=6), disturbed and
artificially capped (n=11), deflated (n=2), dispersed (n=22), and vandalized
(n=17). Investigation at sites in the county in 1985 consisted of excavated (n=1),
tested by hand (n=6), tested by machine (n=1), and surface collected (n=29).
One site was documented as containing human remains, and three sites were
reported to have earthen works. The planning document does not provide site
numbers that can be associated with the above statements. Northeast Texas
Archeological Study Region of the Eastern Planning Region as defined by the
Department of Antiquities Protection in Archeology in the Eastern Planning
Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). According
to the planning document, there were 68 sites recorded in the county as of 1991
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.1.1). In the region, Shelby County was
25th of 31 counties in terms of numbers of sites recorded with less than .037 sites
per kilometer. Of the 68 recorded sites, 3 were considered not significant, 32
were of unknown significance, 29 were probably significant, and 4 were
significant. At the time of this survey there were over 227 recorded prehistoric
and historic sites in the county, and the only sites listed in the in the National
Register of Historic Places are the Shelby County Courthouse and courthouse
square. Three sites have been documented as a State Archeological Landmark.
These are the Shelby County Courthouse, Shelby County Jail, and records
building.
In 1990, William A. Martin of the Texas Historical Commission compiled a
bibliography for the Northeastern Region of Texas (Martin 1990). Martin cites no
references for Shelby County, an indication of the sparse amount of work by
professional archaeologists. The majority of work by professional archaeologists
in the county has been associated with Toledo Bend Reservoir on the TexasLouisiana border and within the Sabine National Forest. The nearest surveys to
the current project area was associated with the recording and assessment of
site 41SY46 in the Sabine National Forest. This site was first recorded during a
survey for a well pad by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. in 1983 (Fields 1983a). At the
time, the site was considered to be significant, so the well pad was relocated. A
second visit to the area found the site to be extensive. This study recovered six
Caddoan sherds through shovel tests and seven Caddoan sherds in a disturbed
area. One sherd was found in a shovel test on one mound, and a second mound
was observed. It was recommended that the project plans be revised so that the
site and surrounding area will be avoided (Fields 1983b).

6

Later that same year, the second proposed alternative location for the well
pad was examined (Prikryl 1983). No evidence of the site was found within the
new footprint, and it was recommended that construction proceed as planned.
In October of 1984, archaeologists from Prewitt & Associates, Inc. visited the site
of the proposed Simpson Federal Number 2 well pad and access road in the
vicinity of the well pad assessed the previous year (Fields 1984). No evidence of
a site was found in the project area. Because the eastern edge of site 41SY46 is
situated relatively close to the proposed well pad and road, it was recommended
that construction personnel be alerted to watch for buried cultural materials.
In September of 1983, Forest Service archaeologist John Ippolito (notes
on file at the United States Forest Service office in Lufkin) visited site 41SY46 to
verify the site and collected data upon which to base a recommendation. At the
time, the site was heavily overgrown and the area had been cut in 1978 and
planted in pines in 1980. Ippolitto shovel tested the site to see if the mound was
natural or artificially constructed. He recovered several core fragments and
primary flakes as well as possible clay balls and concluded that the site should
be protected.
In 1989, Timothy K. Perttula included a discussion of site 41SY46 in his
manuscript entitled A Study of Mound Sites in the Sabine River Basin, Northeast
Texas and Northwest Louisiana (Perttula 1989). He recovered Caddoan sherds
from additional shovel testing and concluded that one of the mounds may have
been used as a platform for a house that had been burned.
Overviews of the area include works by (Lynott and Richner 1977),
Woodall (1972), and Story, et al. (1990). Prehistoric occupations in the region
cover all time periods from Paleoindian through Historic Caddoan, circa 9500
B.C. - A.D. 1860 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:44). The reader is referred to this
comprehensive and well-organized document for additional information regarding
the archaeological background for Shelby County and vicinity.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field the Archeological Site Atlas was checked for
previously recorded sites and past surveys in the area. Three important reports
were reviewed during the planning stages of this project. These are a planning
document by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985), a planning
document by the Department of Antiquities Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993), and an archeological bibliography for the Northeastern Region of Texas
(Martin 1990). The interested reader is referred to these sources for additional
information regarding the prehistory of this area.
Prior to the field survey, a pre-survey assessment was conducted by the
Principal Investigator. The entire route of the water line was driven, and it was
concluded that the only area worthy of shovel testing was on the west bank of
Beauchamp Creek. The Research Design stated that four shovel tests in this
area would be sufficient unless a site was found.
The field investigation was conducted on April 27, 2008. The project area
consisted of an upland area overlooking Beauchamp Creek to the east. The
grass cover made it impossible to view the ground surface; therefore, the area
was investigated solely through shovel testing. The field crew consisted of the
Principal Investigator and Tanner Singleton. Since the water line will be placed
near a fence that separates public land from private property, the shovel tests
were dug in close proximity to this fence and above the adjacent ditch. Four
tests were dug from west to east in the direction of the creek with an interval of
10 meters between each test. The soil from was screened using Â¼ inch hardware
cloth, and the distance between each test was measured using a 50-meter tape.
The tests were terminated at 80 cm because the sandy soil was changing to clay
and was very wet. Shovel test data was recorded on a log, which appears as
Appendix I to this report. The location of each test was plotted on a field map
(Figure 4). Figure 5 illustrates Shovel Test 4. This project was also documented
through field notes and a digital camera.
The east bank of Beauchamp Creek was visited during the pre-survey
assessment and found to be disturbed in some places and low and marsh in
other areas. Therefore, it was not considered to be a high probability area, and it
was not subjected to shovel testing.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed that no professional investigations
have been conducted in the project area, and no archaeological sites are known
to exist. One significant Caddoan mound site (41SY46) is located in the Sabine
National Forest to the north and east of the single high probability area.
Investigations by other archaeologists found no evidence of this site to the south
and west in the vicinity of the high probability area on Beauchamp Creek. Four
shovel tests in the high probability area were dug through sandy soil. The tests
were terminated at 80 cm when the soil was mixed with clay and water was
present from the perched water table. No artifacts were found in any of the four
tests, and there is no evidence that an archaeological site is present in this area.
Due to the frequently flooded nature of the soils, it is not likely that a permanent
camp would be located in this area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found during the shovel testing of the single
high probability area along the two-mile water line as currently proposed. It is,
therefore, recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned by the
Shelbyville WSC without further consultation with the THC. Should the construction
plans change to include additional water line in an area that can be viewed as a
likely setting for a prehistoric site, the THC must be notified in case additional
survey by a professional archaeologist is warranted. Also, if cultural materials are
unearthed during construction, all work in the area of the find must stop until the
THC can evaluate the situation. This study conformed to the Minimum Survey
Standards as defined by the Archaeology Division of the THC.
