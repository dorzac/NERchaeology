Abstract
A Phase I archaeological survey of Joshua Springs Park and Preserve was conducted
during the period of October 2007 to January 2008. The research was done by Abasolo
Archaeological Consultants, under a contract with the Kendall County Commissioners
Court. Since the 407-acre property is located on county lands, the survey was carried out
under the terms of Texas Antiquities Permit 4666, issued by the Texas Historical
Commission. One prehistoric site (41KE10) had been recorded at this locale in 1969.
Field work consisted of a pedestrian survey of the park and the excavation of 25 backhoe
trenches to test for buried archaeological deposits. During our fieldwork, 6 additional
prehistoric sites were found (41KE191-196). These were recorded and were evaluated in
terms of their possible eligibility for nomination as State Archaeological Landmarks or to
the National Register of Historic Places. We recommend that site 41KE10, a buried
prehistoric site of Archaic age, and site 41KE191, marked by at least 21 distinctive burial
cairns, be nominated as State Archaeological Landmarks. Both are eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. While none of the sites appear to
be located in areas that will see any modification during the park development process, it
will be necessary to classify 41KE191 as a restricted area, and perhaps to fence it to
protect from future disturbance or vandalism.

Introduction
Abasolo Archaeological Consultants (AAC) has carried out a preliminary archaeological
study of the 407 acre Joshua Springs Park and Preserve to Kendall County (Fig. 1). The
proposed assessment was for a Phase I archaeological survey of the high probability areas
for cultural resources in the park and was conducted in accordance with the
“Archeological Survey Standards for Texas” (Texas Historical Commission). We
identified several prehistoric sites and provide a set of recommendations in terms of the
plans for the park and preserve. Each archaeological site was evaluated in terms of its
significance and its potential for nomination as a State Archeological Landmark, or
possibly, to the National Register of Historic Places.
Our work has been based on a contractual agreement issued on September 6, 2007 by the
Kendall County Commissioners Court, providing the funding for AAC to carry out the
Phase I archaeological survey. Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4666 was issued by the
Texas Historical Commission to AAC to conduct the archaeological work. Such a permit
was required by State law as the property is on county (public) land. The survey was
carried out between October 4, 2007 and February 22, 2008 by Harry J. Shafer and
Thomas R. Hester.
Joshua Springs Park and Preserve is located six miles northwest of Boerne, within the
eroded margins of the Edwards Plateau. The area, often called the Balcones
Canyonlands, is known for its many canyons, marked topographic relief, numerous
springs, and clear spring-fed streams, all of which aptly describe the Joshua Springs Park
and Preserve.

Proposed Survey Scope
The proposed research design for the survey stated that assessments of cultural resources,
including prehistoric (Native American) and historic (such as early ranching or farming
complexes, or buildings) would be made. The pedestrian survey focused on “high
probability” areas – those locales in which archaeological sites are often present in
Kendall County and the surrounding region—and we made an effort to provide a full
examination, depending on the nature of vegetation, topography, and the constraints of
the budget. Specific attention was paid to the condition of any archaeological resource
with regards to its current state of preservation and possibility of intact cultural deposits.
The creek valleys were regarded as high probability areas for archaeological sites due to
the setting and active springs. The only recorded archaeological site within the park
boundaries prior to our survey was site 41KE10, known as the Mandell Site (Texas
Archeological Site Atlas [TASA], Texas Historical Commission. It was obvious that this
site would have to thoroughly examined and assessed. The site was recorded and tested
by Bill Fawcett in 1969. It was described as large burned rock midden 75 by 85 feet in
diameter and approximately two feet thick (see Appendix A). Time periods indicated by
diagnostic artifacts (Pedernales, Montell, Marcos, Marshall, Lange, Ensor, Edgewood,
and Bulverde points) indicate Middle and Late Archaic components as well as Late
Prehistoric components (represented by arrow points) are present on the terrace. The full

3

extent of the site was unknown and one of the objectives of our survey was to relocate the
site and define the site’s extent and the integrity of the cultural deposits.
Backhoe testing was necessary to properly determine the presence of buried cultural
deposits and to test the integrity of this and, where feasible, other archaeological sites
encountered or high probability landforms. Kendall County provided the backhoe
services as was the case for the James Kiehl Park archaeological survey conducted by
AAC (Hester and Shafer 2007).
All diagnostic artifacts encountered were drawn or digitally photographed for
documentation.
Artifact collection was limited to a few diagnostic items. Upon
completion of field work, the sites found by us were recorded with the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory. Copies of this report will be provided to the Kendall
County Commissioners Court, the Kendall County Parks and Preserve Board, and the
Texas Historical Commission. Based on a review at the Texas Historical Commission,
and their evaluation of the archaeological findings, the State Historic Preservation Officer
will inform the planners involved with Joshua Springs Park and Preserve as to whether
additional survey or evaluation will be needed. Additionally, the protection of certain
important sites will be addressed. Artifacts recovered are curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.

The Setting
Joshua Springs Park and Preserve is located in southwestern Kendall County, east of IH
10, six miles northwest of Boerne. Little Joshua Creek, a tributary of the Guadalupe
River, is the primary drainage cutting through the proposed park area. A confluence with
the much smaller Allen Creek occurs near the park’s east end.
The creeks have cut
through the upper member of the Early Cretaceous Glen Rose limestone (Kgru; Reeves
1976), and the valleys on the north side of Little Joshua Creek are typified by the stony,
shallow soils of the Brackett-Eckrant association (Dittemore and Hensell 1981). South
of the creek are extensive deposits of the alluvial Krum soils (ibid.:20-21).
The dominant physiographic feature within the terrain is Ring Mountain (see Fig. 15A)
rising to a summit of 1758 feet above sea level. The channel of Little Joshua Creek was
fairly deeply incised, though this is masked by two mid-20th century dams that have
impounded two lakes within the park boundaries; a third dam is upstream beyond the
southwest edge of the property.
Earlier owners of the property have put in homes and outbuildings, gravel and paved
roads, and cleared vegetation extensively in some areas. Scattered oaks are prominent in
the northern section of the park, with thicker vegetation (oak, elm, pecan, hackberry,
buckeye, ashe juniper (“cedar”), persimmon, agarita, and many other plants (as
documented by Steve Lowe of the park staff) along parts of the stream channels and on

4

the field margins. Earlier owners created a major trash dump on the steep slopes of the
south side of Little Joshua Creek, adjacent to and upstream from the creek crossing,
above the confluence of this creek with Allen Creek. Some fields have apparently been
cultivated for many decades. Today, these fields support dense growths of coastal
Bermuda grass, making surface survey impossible. Park staff shredded some transects of
the fields, but we had to rely on multiple backhoe trenches to determine if cultural
materials were present.
It was beyond the scope of our project to carry out any sort of historical research. Most
structures on the property appear to date from the last half of the 20th century. However,
there is a tin-covered barn that is possibly older. It is in a building cluster near the park
entrance on County Road 289.

Archaeological Background
Overview and Cultural Chronology
The south-central Texas area, including Kendall County, has a long chronology of human
occupation. Native American and Anglo-European use of the abundant resources of this
area, over the past 11,000 years, has left a variety of cultural remains on the landscape.
However, scientific archaeology has been extremely limited in Kendall County and many
sites have been destroyed by unscientific diggers searching for projectile points. Many
of the surveys and site-testing programs date to the 1970s and 1980s (Bass and Hester
1975; Kelly and Hester 1976). These were related to Soil Conservation Service flood
control programs on Upper Cibolo Creek.
Additionally, the Southern Texas
Archaeological Association carried out a survey of the Haag Ranch on Goss Creek
(Neureuther 1985, 1986) and documented at least 24 prehistoric sites.
In the 1980s, the late C. K. Chandler recorded several sites (41KE122- KE125) on the
north side of Cibolo Creek. These include open campsites and a burned rock midden.
Other avocational archaeologists, like Chandler, have documented special artifacts from
the county, such as Folsom points that date to ca. 8800 B.C. (McReynolds 1992, 2002).
In the late 1990s, archaeologists from The University of Texas at San Antonio carried out
research in the area of Northrup Park in Boerne (Nickels 1998). This is in the area of the
confluence of Frederick and Cibolo Creeks. Seven prehistoric sites were documented.
The data from known sites in Kendall County, and the region around it, permits us to
briefly outline the cultural chronology of the area.
The Paleoindian period, 9,200-6,800 B.C., has distinctive chipped stone spear points
used in hunting mammoth and other late Ice Age mammals early in the period
(McReynolds 2003). Other spear types appear with a shift to bison, deer and other game
after the Ice Age ended around 8000 B.C. In Kendall County, Paleoindian point types
include the Folsom type (ca. 8800 B.C.; McReynolds 2002). The authors have recorded a

5

Clovis-age blade core (ca. 9200 B.C.) in the Cibolo Creek drainage near Boerne, while a
Clovis projectile point is reported by Chandler (1983) from East Sister Creek. Chandler
(1983) and Neureuther also report Angostura points (ca. 6800 B.C., of Late Paleoindian
age, both from northeast Kendall County.
Sites of the following Archaic period are common in Kendall County. These peoples
were hunters and gatherers as in the earlier Paleoindian period, but lived in an
environment very similar to those of modern times. Projectile points used to tip spears
(often erroneously called “arrowheads”) change in shape through time, from 6,800 B.C.
to 500 A.D. Archaeologists use these forms to recognize more specific time frames
within the Archaic (e.g., Early, Middle and Late Archaic). In Kendall County, the most
distinctive Archaic site is the burned rock midden (Black et al. 1997). These large
accumulations of fire-cracked limestone result from the use of earth-oven cooking
starting around 3,000 B.C. Such features were sometimes part of open campsites, with
large amounts of flint debris from tool-making; sometimes, animal bone (dietary remains)
and charcoal that can be used for radiocarbon dating. Another site type in Kendall County
is the rockshelter, utilizing shallow caves or cliff overhangs for occupation locales. A
major occupation associated with a rockshelter is 41KE110 on Goss Creek. Neureuther
(1986) has reported the excavations at the site, dating largely to Middle and Late Archaic
times. At another such site, 41KE66 (near Sisterdale) red-painted motifs are found on the
shelter wall (Neureuther 1985). Other Archaic site types include lithic procurement areas
(where flint cobbles eroded out of the Edwards limestone and were processed), lithic
scatters (lightly-used areas probably representing short-term hunting and gathering
activities), and rarely, sinkhole burials (Archaic peoples often disposed of their dead by
placing them in sinkholes and caverns; one such site is known near Spicewood Canyon;
Neureuther 1985:28).
By 700 A.D., there began to be some changes in the long hunter-gatherer life way. The
Late Prehistoric is first seen with the introduction of the bow and arrow. The stone
arrow points are very small (mistakenly called “bird points”), but could be used in
hunting game of any size. By 1300 A.D., the economy emphasized buffalo-hunting.
Most sites of this era include campsites, and rockshelters often at spots previously used
by Archaic peoples, lithic scatters of this age; and the lithic procurement areas of earlier
times continued to be used.
During the Historic period, no known Spanish Colonial site has been recorded in Kendall
County although some exploration and exploitation of the area probably took place.
Native American groups, particularly unnamed indigenous bands, Lipan Apache, and
Comanche were known to have briefly settled or traversed this part of the Balcones
Canyonlands. European settlers braved the frontier to settle the canyons along the upper
Guadalupe. The best known archaeological remains are ranch and farm houses of cut
stone and stone fences dating from the 1840s through the 1880s. Such sites, including
those without surviving structures, are recognized from 19th century pottery fragments,
artifacts of glass and metal, etc. Later Historic houses and farmsteads, through the early
1900s, are also found. These structures are often board and batten houses constructed of

6

square nails; remnants of stone fireplaces and stone or brick-lined cisterns often are all
that remains of these structures.
Sites near the Park Project Area
A review of the archaeological literature, as well as the Texas Archeological Site Atlas
(Texas Historical Commission), indicates that very little archaeological work has been
done in the region surrounding the Joshua Springs park property. Indeed, within the
USGS Waring 7.5’ topographic map, only five previously documented sites are to be
found. These were recorded by Bement (1983) during an archaeological survey of an
LCRA transmission line corridor running from Zorn (Comal County) to Comfort
(Kendall County). Sites 41KE84 and 41KE85 are to the north of Joshua Springs Park,
located on bluffs overlooking the Guadalupe River valley near the town of Comfort.
Both of these sites are described as “lithic scatters,” marked by the presence of firecracked rock, chert (flint) flakes, and non-diagnostic stone artifacts. Both are in thin soils
over bedrock and have no research potential. 41KE86 is on an unnamed tributary of the
Guadalupe River northwest of the present survey area. It is a burned rock midden, 75
meters in circumference and 1-1.5 meters high. It lies in a field plowed for many years.
Concentrated fire-cracked rock extends to a depth of 20 cm below the surface. Plowing
and subsequent erosion had exposed numerous stone tools, cores, flakes and Pedernales
dart points. The Pedernales type dates to the Middle Archaic, around 2100-1000 B.C.
(Turner and Hester 1993), and is often associated with burned rock middens in central
Texas (Bement 1983:8).
Farther to the south are sites 41ME87 and 41ME88, the first on Big Joshua Creek, and
the second, Little Joshua Creek, east-southeast and downstream from Joshua Springs
Park. At 41ME87, a site had been exposed and largely destroyed by stock tank
construction. The survey team recorded fire-cracked rock, flakes, and cores over a large
area. The site is characterized as a “lithic scatter,” probably representing short term
occupation. At 41ME88, a small occupation site is located on a terrace west of Little
Joshua Creek. Cultural deposits are found to at least 50 cm below the surface. Dart
points of the Late Archaic were found (Castroville and Marcos types; see Turner and
Hester 1993).
Finally, there are two recently recorded sites north and northwest of the Joshua Springs
study area. Both sites, 41KE173 and 174, are on Big Joshua Creek. These are lithic
scatters, perhaps temporary campsites (TASA). The Mandell Site (41KE10) was
investigated within the park by Bill Fawcett in 1969. Fawcett’s report is presented in
Appendix I.

Field Methods
The field investigations included pedestrian survey, backhoe testing, and limited hand
excavation at 41KE191. Much of the property consisted of shallow soils and eroded
substrate with exposed bedrock. Therefore, shovel testing was not necessary to explore
for buried archaeological deposits in the upland portions of the property. The upland

7

rocky areas were inspected on foot and we succeeded in recording five sites 41KE192,
193, 194, 195, and 196 (Fig. 2). 41KE191 was recorded along the low bluff on the north
side of Little Joshua Creek above the upper dam (Fig. 2). The terraces and fields,
however, were so heavily overgrown with coastal Bermuda grass that surface inspection
was useless. Soil depth on the terraces was significant and required subsurface
investigations. For that reason and because of the high probability setting for
archaeological sites along the terraces bordering the creeks, extensive testing using a
backhoe was employed instead of shovel testing. Five separate formally cultivated fields,
identified as fields 1-5 (Fig. 2) and a combined total of 25 backhoe trenches were
excavated. The backhoe testing succeeded in confirming the location of 41KE10 in Field
1. The locations and descriptions of all of the sites either recorded or investigated are
presented below.
All sites were recorded with Garmin hand-held GPS units.
coordinates references are with UTM Zone 14, NAD 83.

Field Work
Field work commenced on October 4, 2007 with a pedestrian survey of the Allen Creek
portion of the park and concluded with the documentation of rock cairns at 41KE191 on
February 22, 2008. Pedestrian survey of the uplands and valley succeeded in locating six
sites, and backhoe testing confirmed the location of one site, 41KE10. A small lithic
scatter of fire-cracked rock and chipped stone designated as JS-2 (41KE196) was noted at
the property line on a limestone bench west of Allen Creek. A series of small rock
shelters, designated as 41KE193, were noted along a bluff on the southeast side of Little
Joshua Creek. One chipped stone flake was observed on the talus and several of the
small shelters have potential for containing cultural resources. Another lithic scatter was
recorded on the bluff top south of Little Joshua Creek near the west property line. This
deposit was designated as JS-3 (41KE192). A small burned rock midden, 41KE194, was
identified on the north side of the lake at the property line. Another lithic scatter,
41KE195, was recorded on the north side of the lake and north of the dam. The most
interesting site consisted of two linear clusters of 21 rock cairns (41KE191) located on
the north side of Little Joshua Creek below the dam.
No shovel tests were excavated in the uplands due to the fact that the soils are
characteristically very shallow as evidenced by large areas of exposed bedrock. All five
of the field locations in which alluvial or colluvial deposits occurred were considered to
be high probability areas for archaeological sites; each field was tested with the aid of a
backhoe. The results of these investigations are narrated below.
With the permission of Mark Denton at the Texas Historical Commission, three of the
cairns at 41KE191 were partly dismantled to investigate the possibility that these may be
covering Native American burials. On February 22, 2008 Shafer and Hester returned to
the site and conducted additional investigations at Cairns # 4, 8, and 12. The results of
these tests are reported under the description of each cairn.

Site Descriptions
Seven archaeological sites were recorded during the course of the archaeological survey
at Joshua Springs Park and Preserve. Two are burned rock midden sites, 41KE10 and
41KE194; 41KE10 has buried components. Three sites, 41KE192, 193, and 196 are
surface lithic scatters, one is a possible rockshelter (41KE193), and one is a cluster of
rock cairns (41KE191). Each site is described below and is located in Figure 2.

41KE10 (JS-1)
As noted above, site 41KE10 was designated as the Mandell Site by Bill Fawcett when he
first recorded the site in 1969. The site is described as a large burned rock midden
(Feature 1). Mr. Fawcett kindly provided the authors copies of his original field notes
which are provided in Appendix I. His meticulous notes for the time are a significant
addition to the information derived from our investigations at the site. The site is a burned
rock midden with an associated buried component. The artifact sample collected by
Fawcett indicates that the occupations in the site area span a timeframe from perhaps as
early as Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric. The most dense period of occupation based on
the temporally diagnostic projectile point styles (Pedernales, Castroville, Montell, and
Frio), however, appears to have been in the Late Archaic.
Our investigations noted fire-cracked rock in the road between the field and the creek and
an intact hearth in the woods south of the field. The fire-cracked rock and hearth were
originally designated as JS 1, and a light scatter of fire-cracked rock also was noted no
the hill slope to the southeast. Unknown to us at the time the hearth and fire-cracked rock
were likely outlying features associated with 41KE10.
Backhoe testing was necessary to help relocate 41KE10 (Figs. 3 and 4). Because of the
dense grass cover, no such midden was obvious when the pedestrian survey was
conducted although the topographic relief of the field indicated potential locations. There
are two high areas in the field, one borders the west fence next to the pasture road that
runs between the field and creek, and the other is on the eastern margins of the field
where the upland slope begins.
The field was in coastal Bermuda grass and had not been bailed for some time, so the
grass mat and cover was so thick that the ground was obscured. However, there was
some noticeable topographic relief within the field where one might expect a midden to
occur. Ten trenches were excavated in this field (Figs. 3-7) in an attempt to locate the
burned rock midden site. The midden was located associated with a buried A-horizon
that contained a Late Archaic campsite deposit. As noted earlier, the hearth and burned
rock scatter noted on the wooded slope immediately to the south are considered as
outlying features of 41KE10. Each of the 10 backhoe trenches along with the soil profile
is described individually.

BHT#1. Located 19 meters from the fence in the southwest part of the field and at GPS
0518224E/3305625N, the trench reached a depth of 75 cm and was 3.5 meters long. The
profile described from the surface is as follows:
0-10 cm
10-30 cm
30-75 cm

Plow zone, dark grayish brown sandy clay loam, Munsell
10YR3/2, two fire-cracked rock were observed.
Dark grayish brown sandy loam, Munsell 10YR 4/3, sterile
Sand and gravel, pale brown, Munsell 10YR6/3, sterile

BHT#2. This trench was some 45 meters north of BHT#1 and also 19 meters east of the
fence line.
It was 3 meters long, 1.17 meters deep.
GPS location was
0518249E/3305650N. The buried gravel deposit encountered in BHT#1 was not present
here at the depth that we tested. Instead the soils were a sandy loam. No cultural
material was observed. The profile is as follows:
0-30 cm
30-42 cm
42-100.
100-117 cm

Very dark brown sandy clay loam, Munsell 10YR3/2, sterile
Transition to yellowish brown sandy loam, Munsell 10YR4/6,
sterile
Sandy loam, sterile, Munsell 10YR6/3
Very pale brown sandy loam, sterile, Munsell 10YR7/4

BHT#3. This trench is located east of BHT#2 in an area of the field where TARL has the
site plotted; the location does not fit our topographic expectation but we needed to test it
anyway. The trench was 3 meter long and 95 cm deep. Again, no cultural material was
present. The GPS location of this trench is: 0518273E/3305619N.
The profile
beginning at the surface reads thusly;
0-24 cm.
24-35 cm.
35-60 cm.
60-95 cm.

Dark grayish brown, Munsell 10YR4/2, sterile
Yellowish brown clay with ped structure, Munsell 10YR5/4, sterile
Brownish yellow clay loam, Munsell 10YR6/6, sterile
Dense gravels, sterile

BHT#4. The GPS location of this trench that was placed east of BHT#3 near the small
swale that drains the field is: 0518309E/3305696N. It was 3 meters long and 85 cm
deep. Gravels were encountered again. The profile is identical to that seen in BHT#3 and
will not be repeated here. No cultural material came out of the trench.
BHT#5. This trench was located along the toe slope of the upland along the east side of
the field. The slope is defined by its topography and by a slight swale that lies between it
and the areas of BHT#4. The GPS location is 0518341E/3305501N. No cultural material
was present. The profile description beginning at the surface is as follows:
0-20 cm.
20-37 cm

Plow zone; very dark clay loam with some limestone sand
10YR3/3.
Dark brown clay loam 10YR4/3

37-63 cm.
63-70 cm.

Yellowish brown clay loam 10YR5/4
Pale brown clay loam with some limestone sand and tiny gavel
from colluvial slope 10YR6/3.

BHT#6. We chose the location of this trench based on the patch of nightshade that was
growing in the area. Steve Lowe, the botanist for the park, suggested that we may want
to test that since nightshade is a plant that likes disturbed soils. A burned rock midden
may represent that kind of disturbance, so we placed a test in the middle of the patch.
The trench was at GPS location 0518279E/3305530N and was southwest of BTH#5. The
soils were indeed different and promising and we did observe a fire-cracked rock in the
profile, but nothing in the back dirt. The main difference was the presence of a buried Ahorizon that indicated an old stable surface (Fig. 5). Such surfaces often have
archaeology associated if they are the right age. The profile of the trench is as follows:
0-18 cm.
18-47cm.
47-85 cm.

Very dark brown clay loam.
Dark brown clay loam with calcium carbonate stringers, the buried
A-horizon
Yellowish brown clay. A fire-cracked rock was noted at 60 cm
below surface.

BHT#7. This trench was placed south of BHT#1 in the southwest corner of the field,
thinking the two FCR seen in the plow zone might be an indicator of a more concentrated
cultural deposit. We recorded a hearth south of the field in the cluster of trees between
the field and the creek on a previous visit. This 1-meter deep trench revealed the same
profile, soils over gravel, that was recorded in BHT#1 and will not be repeated here. The
GPS location for BHT#7 is 051874E/33055778N. No cultural material was observed but
after three trenches placed along the west and higher portion of the field; we concluded
that the site does not exist in this area. So, we moved to another patch of nightshade in
the southeastern portion of the field not far from the south end.
BHT#8. This trench which reached a length of 6 meters finally revealed the cultural
deposit later given the trinomial designation of 41KE10. Not surprisingly it was
associated with the buried A-horizon seen in BHT#6.
The GPS location is
0518204E/3305504N. The back dirt immediately began to show fire-cracked rock,
Rabdotus, chert flakes, lots of burned daub, and bits of bison bone. The burned daub
feature, Feature 2, is described separately below. The lens of daub clearly does not
correlate with a burned tree and is regarded as a cultural feature. The trench profile
shown in Figures 7 and 8 and are described from the surface as follows:
0-20 cm.
20-55cm.

55-120 cm.

Very dark gray clay, Munsell 10YR3/1, some burned rock and
flakes.
Very dark grayish brown clay, Munsell 10\YR3/2, buried A
horizon with fire-cracked rock, Rabdotus, flakes, bone, mussel
shell, burned daub, Frio point.
Dark yellowish brown clay, Munsell 10YR4/4, Rabdotus,
occasional fire-cracked rock, flakes.

BHT#9. This trench, located ca. 4.5 meters north of BHT#8, was dug to see if the
cultural material extended northward. It did. GPS location is 0518205E/3305478N.
This trench was 3 meter long and 1.5 meters deep. The profile was identical to that in
BHT#8 and will not be repeated here. Fire-cracked rock, lots of Rabdotus land snails,
and flakes were noted in the back dirt and trench wall. The concentrated cultural deposits
here were about 40-60 cm below surface and extends at least to 75 cm below surface. A
lens of snail hash was observed 47-50 cm below surface. Snail hash is a descriptive term
used to describe Rabdotus shells that have been crushed presumably from human traffic
on a relatively stable surface. The snails were a common food source among Native
Americans in central, south, and southwest Texas. Rabdotus hash is a good indicator of
cultural activity.
BHT#10. This trench was located southeast of BHT#9 on the toe slope of the uplands.
We wanted to see if the site extended that far and if a burned rock midden might be
present. The latter was not but some FCR and Rabdotus were seen in the profile
indicating that the site area does extend to this part of the field, although no buried Ahorizon was observed here probably because of colluvial source for much of the soil.
The profile is as follows:
0-50 cm.
50-80 cm.

Very dark grayish brown clay loam, 10YR3/2. Some FCR and
Rabdotus
Dark yellowish brown clay loam, 10YR4/4. Some Rabdotus,
a FCR seen in the profile at 75 cm below surface.

Cultural Features at 41KE10
Two cultural features were identified at the site. Feature 1 is the burned rock midden
described by Bill Fawcett, and Feature 2 is the lens of burned daub, some wattle
impressed, identified in Trench #8. The descriptions of Features 1 and Feature 2 are
described below.
Feature 1: The burned rock midden feature is located in the north-northeast portion of the
site (Figure 3). The midden location was confirmed by the topography and shovel
probes. The midden matrix is composed of dense burned rock and black soil (Munsell
10YR2/1). Hand-held Garmin GPS points taken around the topographic feature area as
follows: Center, 0518254E/3305492N; north end, 0518254E/3305498N; south end,
0518229E, 3305495N; west side, 0518233E/3305496N; east side, 0518246E, 3305487N.
Given the margin of error for the GPS, the midden itself measures approximately 23
meters north-south and 15 meters east-west; the height is perceptible but was not
measured although certainly it has been plowed down considerably. We chose not to test
the midden with a backhoe trench since Fawcett had already tested it with the excavation
of two 5-foot squares (Appendix I). Our trenches did allow us to map out the overall
extent of cultural material around the midden and located an intact buried component.

Feature 2: Feature 2 is a lens of burned daub, some wattle impressed, identified in
BHT#8. The daub lens is associated with a concentrated deposit of cultural refuse
(flakes, fire-cracked rock, Rabdotus land snails, mussel shell, and a wide-base Frio point)
40-50 cm below the surface. The GPS location taken form the feature for the trench is
0518204E/3305504N. The feature consisted of a concentration of burned daub that
extended intermittently for at least two meters along the profile. It was about 5 cm thick
and the daub was in various size pieces, the largest collected from the back dirt shows the
impression of three poles converging toward a central point (Fig. 8B, C). The clay
appears to have been used to help stabilize and probably insulate a pole and thatch
structure possibly composed of three pole framework. While exploring the burned clay
feature a wide-base Frio dart point (Fig. 8A) was found 50 cm below the surface and
associated with the deposit containing the daub lens. The lens of daub clearly does not
correlate with a burned tree and is a cultural feature.
Discussion
Our objectives were to locate the burned rock midden and to explore the buried deposits
in the field using a backhoe in order to determine the horizontal extent of 41KE10 and
assess the integrity of the deposits. The site area and burned rock midden are shown in
the Figure 3 based on positive and negative backhoe trenches, topography, and vegetation
patterns. Extensive testing of the site itself was overruled because of its intact nature, and
since we were able to confirm Fawcett’s previous location of the site. Given the
previous information on the site provided by Bill Fawcett and our own findings, we can
conclude the following: 1), the site is predominately Archaic in age; 2) the burned rock
midden is mostly intact albeit its height has been altered by plowing and evidence of
previous digging is evident; 3) the buried deposits off the midden have excellent
stratigraphic integrity. In fact, we feel that BHT#8 cut through a Late Archaic house
feature based on all of the daub that we found. Given the intact nature of the off-midden
deposits that are buried possibly as deep as 75-100 cm below surface, we recommend that
this area of the field be protected from future development.

41KE196 (JS-2)
A scatter of fire-cracked rock and chipped stone was observed on a bedrock outcrop
along an old road bed at the southern park boundary west of Allen’s creek (Fig. 9A, B).
The GPS readings are 0517787E/3305286N. One hard-hammer interior flake was seen
amongst the rocks. There was no intact hearth present but the concentration appears to be
an out scatter from a shallow burned rock midden. The soils here are very shallow and
there limestone bedrock is exposed in several areas of the site. Because of the shallow
soils and exposed limestone shovel testing was not necessary. Dense grass cover upslope
to the west and an artificial berm on the east prevented further assessment, but the scatter
along the old road bed extended for about 30 meters although the occupation are may
extend beyond the park boundary.

13

41KE192 (JS-3)
This site is a surface lithic scatter consisting of fire-cracked rock, chert flakes and
artifacts (Fig. 10A-D) . Three biface fragments and a single expanding stem dart point
base were observed (Fig. 11). The GPS coordinates are: 0517206E/3305703N. The
cultural material extended over an area of at least 35 meters east-west and some 30
meters north-south. Most of the material was on the ledge overlooking the creek, but
some material was observed up slope too. The slope was rocky with much exposed
limestone. Shovel probes indicated very shallow soils overlying bedrock. The chert was
mostly interior flakes and fragments indicating that this was a campsite. It also
appropriate to point out that the limestone formations here belongs to the Cretaceous
Glen Rose group and there are no chert beds or nodules occurring naturally. The only
chert that we saw were small nodules of what appear to be highly weathered Uvalde
gravels, deeply weathered cortex and overall poor quality in contrast to the high quality
of the chipped stone observed. No further recommendations are in order for JS#3.

41KE193 (JS-4)
JS-4 consists of a series of at least four shallow rock shelters along this west-facing bluff
overlooking Joshua Springs Creek (Fig. 11A, B). The shelters are not continuous but
from north to south the sheltered bluff area measures about 100 meters. The shelters do
offer protection although the relatively soft limestone has caused quite a bit of
exfoliation, covering any physical evidence of human occupation. That said, one flake
was found and the likelihood that these were occupied or used for burials is realistic.
Therefore, we gave this high probability area a site designation. The larger of the shelters
measures about 35 m long and 2 to 3 meters deep (Fig. 11B). The GPS location for the
north end of the larger shelter is 0517944E/3305666N. We searched for any trace of rock
art as well since such shelters often do have traces in other Canyonland situations. None
was found. No further archaeological work is recommended for this shelter site although
it should be designated as a restricted area.
41KE194 (JS-5)
Site 41JS-5 is a small burned rock midden located next to the property line north of Little
Joshua Creek (Fig. 13A). In fact, the property line fence cuts across the western margins
of the midden. The midden is situated on a rocky bluff overlooking the creek. The firecracked rock scatter is about 15 m by 15 m in area and no more than 20 cm deep (Fig.
13B). The UTM coordinates are: 0517227E/3305923N. No diagnostic artifacts were
found however.
41KE195 (JS-6)
The GPS coordinates for this site are 0517512E/3305993N. . Bedrock and shallow soil
was exposed along the bench indicate the scatter was at least 50 meters north-south and

14

some 30 meters east-west (Fig. 14A). Flakes, scattered fire-cracked rock, a Martindale
type point base and a biface distal fragment (Fig. 14B) were observed. Because the soil is
either eroded to bedrock are very shallow, the cultural material was essentially confined
to the surface. In other words, there is no depth to the deposit. The chipping debitage,
which consisted of both hammer stone flakes and interior flakes, suggest campsite
activities. No further archaeological investigations are recommended for this site.
41KE191 (JS-7)
The site, consisting of at least 21 rock cairns, is located on the north side of Little Joshua
Creek, along a slope just above the 1600-foot contour line (Figs. 2, 15-17). Though the
channel is now inundated by a man-made lake, the locale was doubtless selected to
provide to overlook the stream. In the background, immediately to the south, is Ring
Mountain, a prominent hill rising to 1758 feet a.s.l. (Fig. 15A), the summit of which is
540 meters to the southwest.
The Soil Survey of Kendall County (Dittemore and Hensell 1981 ) indicates that the major
part of the site, as it parallels Little Joshua Creek, is within the Doss silty clay. From our
perspective, the area in and around the site is best characterized as Brackett-Eckrant soil
association, shown on the General Soil Map of this publication. The shallow to very
shallow soil depth, mostly on stony or gravelly uplands, was at least the origin of the
eroded matrix seen at the site.
The rock features at the site lie just below the “break,” where the relatively flat terrain on
the north slopes down to Little Joshua Creek. A park road runs roughly parallel to the
site, and all features found so far have been between the road and the vegetation near the
lake edge (Fig. 17).
The site was found on October 25, 2007 as we were surveying the middle and upper portions
of Little Joshua Creek within the park boundaries. Hester came across a distinctive rock
cairn (Cairn 10) and as he continued westward on the creek, noted one or two more. After
talking with park employees John Jenkins who used to work for the previous private owner, it
was established that these features were somewhat known but with no local history as to their
function. Jenkins said that the earlier owner liked to hand clear rocks from the property and
suggested that these features might be related to that practice.
Shafer and Hester later went back to the locality, and were joined by Steve Lowe, park
ecologist, who said that he had previously seen seven of these features. The cairns are in a
rough linear cluster that is about 100 meters long (east-west) and 25 meters wide (northsouth, on the northern slope of the creek bank).
The site area is open, though with thick grass along the slopes above the creek. In order to
record several of the cairns, John Jenkins had to use a weed-eater to better expose them.
There are a few oaks, surely the remnants of earlier clearing operations to remove she juniper
and other shrubs. To the north is a broad flat pasture and to the south, the channel of Little
Joshua Creek. The latter has been heavily modified. A dam about 200 meters upstream to
the west, has impounded a lake that is roughly 180 meters long and 70 meters at its widest

15

point. It has a maximum depth of about 20 feet. Below the dam is a series of waterfalls and
races, the age of which is unclear given the dam-building operations that so drastically
changed the face of the creek. These dams were apparently built at different times in the
mid-20th century.

Description of the Cairns
Two clusters of cairns were observed at the site, the eastern cluster and the western
cluster. The eastern cluster which includes Cairns 1-10 and 21 are located on the upper
bluff slope, while Cairns 11-20 are on a lower bench. All are on the north bank slope
overlooking natural falls on the south side of Little Joshua Creek. Basic data are
provided for all of the cairns is provided in Table 1, and the 10 cairns in the eastern
cluster (1-10) are described below. Also, the excavated data for two (Cairns 4 and 12)
are presented below. . Table 1 provides the northing and easting UTM coordinates for
each cairn; measurements are given as east-west and north-south dimensions, and where
possible, height of the cairn (above the surrounding ground surface) is estimated.

Comments

Eastern Cluster
Cairn 1 (Fig. 18A)
This is the near the western end of this cluster. Only Cairn #21 is farther to the west.
westernmost of the cairns in this cluster. It is a low, eroded or disturbed feature, only about
15 cm high. Larger rocks which likely topped or bordered parts of the cairn are scattered and
clearly out of place. It measures 1.8 meters north-south and 1.8 meters east-west
Cairn 2 (Fig. 18B)
About 5 meters south and 3 meters east of Cairn 1. Cairn 2 appears to have been badly
disturbed. Rocks are scattered down slope, north to south. The best approximation of its size
is 2.8 meters north-south and 2.3 meters east-west.
Cairn 3 (Fig. 19A)
The feature is located about 6 meters south and 5 meters east of Cairn 2. It appears to be
somewhat disturbed, though relatively intact, standing 30 cm in height. It is 1.2 meters
north-south and 1.1 meters east-west. Large rocks appear to be used to “pack” the smaller
stones, as well as to cap it.
Cairn 4 (Fig. 19B-D)
Located 6 meters south and 12 meters east of Cairn 3, the cairn is very well preserved. The
tightly packed rocks are capped with two large stones, and the southern edge, in particular, is
held in place by 14-16 larger stones roughly arranged in two, possibly 3, rows. Height is 50
cm, and is 1.7 meters north-south and 1.6 meters east-west.
Like cairn 7, this feature is lower on the slope that the other cairns. This cairn was tested by
cutting it in half along the north-south axes to obtain a cross-section profile. This cairn was
indeed filling a pit excavated about 30 cm deep into the slope (Fig. 19, 20). A more detailed
description appears below.
Cairn 5 (Fig. 21A)
This cairn has begun to erode down slope, about 8 meters north and 4 meters east of Cairn 4.
It is 1.8 meters north-south and 1.25 meters east west and is 20 cm high in its present form.
These dimensions, however, reflect a cairn that has apparently collapsed from erosion or
disturbance. The larger stones have slipped down slope to the south.

17

Cairn 6 (Fig. 21B)
This feature is about 12 meters east and 5 meters south of Cairn 5. It is about 30 cm high, 1.5
meters north-south and 1.3 meters east-west. Although on a fairly steep slope, it appears
largely intact with larger stones around the perimeter to help hold the cairn in place.
Cairn 7 (Fig. 21C)
The cairn is located down slope from Cairn 6, about 12 meters south of that feature, and
about 6 meters above (north) of the lake edge. It is somewhat scattered, but the present rock
accumulation is 2.1 meters north-south and 2.4 meters east-west. It is approximately 30 cm
high. The large measurements at its base reflect disturbance and scattering of some of the
rocks, but the larger stones are still concentrated around the perimeter.
Cairn 8 (Fig. 21D)
At roughly the middle of the known site outline, an unpaved road turns south from the paved
road, paralleling the creek, and runs down slope to the earthen dam that impounds the lake.
The dirt road has cut into Cairn 8, just south of the paved road, 30 meters east and south of
Cairn 7. Upon close inspection, it looks as if the cairn has suffered considerable disturbance
along its western side. Some of the larger stones are notably displaced but the main form of
the cairn is preserved. It is 1.5 meters north-south and 1.3 meters east-west. The remnants
are about 25 cm high, a measurement that is likely affected by the disturbance and
subsequent erosion.
Cairn 9 (Fig. 22A)
We consider this to be a probable cairn 30 meters east of Cairn 8 and 35 meters south of the
paved road. It is about 20 cm high, 1.2 meters north-south and 1 meter east-west. It is
smaller and less apparent that other cairns at the site, and has also been disturbed. Given the
overall context of this site, this is likely a cairn, perhaps associated with a child’s grave pit.
Cairn 10 (Fig. 22B)
This is the easternmost cairn at the site, and the one first noted in October 2007. It is about 40
meters east of Cairn 9. The cairn is very well preserved and is rectangular in outline. Its
dimension are 1.5 meters north-south, 1.3 meters east-west and 50 cm in height.
Western Cluster
The location of the western cluster of cairns is shown in Figure . Descriptions are not
provided here, but the data for each is presented in Table 1. Cairn # 12 was partly
dismantled (Fig. 23B) and was also found to be covering a pit. As a group, the western
cluster cairns were larger and one, Cairn #13, curiously was constructed in front of a small
niche in the limestone bluff.

Initial Observations on Cairn Function at 41KE191

18

That the rock cairns at 41KE191 filled and capped pits excavated into the low bluff slope
has been demonstrated by our limited investigations Also, it was determined that the
rock cairns have been there for a significant period of time, beyond the recollection of
any witness that was interviewed, and very likely sometime in prehistory. The question
that remains is why would someone excavate a pit and fill it with rocks?
As we further explore below, rock cairns are not that rare in the archaeological record,
and were most often used to cap burials in prehistory. If, in this case, they were used to
cap burials, why did we not find traces of bone? The answer to that can be explained by
taphonomic processes, those processes that act on bone when it becomes exposed to the
elements, and because we only test three cairns. Exposed bone does not last long, only a
few years at most, in the Balcones Canyonlands as any rancher or hunter knows. Placing
a human body beneath a pile of rocks is tantamount to exposing it to surface conditions
albeit outside of the reach of praying scavengers. Certainly, the normal decaying
processes of flesh and tissue would not last long, and the bone would soon be exposed to
percolating water, wet-dry conditions, etc. that tend to accelerate its decay rate. In short,
one would not expect human bone to be preserved for more than a few decades, and
certainly not more than a century or two. If the cairns are at least 1000 years old, as we
suspect but, at present, cannot prove, no bone would be expected to survive. It may be
best to think of them to them as mortuary features rather than as burials per se since no
bone was preserved in the two undisturbed cairns that have thus far been partially
examined.
The arrangement of this series of cairns and that fact that other rock cairn sites had been
recorded (if only rarely) from central and west central, led us to be concerned with the
function of these features. We felt that they likely constructed to fill and cover grave pits,
and we thus asked Mark Denton of the Texas Historical Commission for permission
(under our Antiquities Permit) to dismantle a small part of one or more cairns to see what
could be learned to which Denton agreed. This field work took place on February 22,
2008 and was overseen by Steve Lowe, Kendall County Parks biologist.
Cairn #4. We chose to start with one of the larger and better preserved cairns in the
eastern cluster and dismantled half of it to obtain wall profiles (Figs. 19B, 19C). Cairn 4
was rectangular, measuring 1.6 meters along the west side, 1.6 meters across the southern
boundary, and was 1.7 meters from southwest to northeast corners. The height was
estimated to be about 50 cm. We chose to cut the cairn in half along the north-south axes
to obtain a cross-section profile (Fig. 20). We being by removing stones by hand and the
small stones and earth were removed using trowels. The cairn was measured and
numerous digital photos taken before dismantling in order to reconstruct it as accurately
as possible. As we began to take out the stones, we noted that the underlying stones were
bleached while those capping the feature were weathered gray. This suggested that the
cairn has been here for some time. Also, it soon became obvious that the rocks were
filling a pit (Figs. 19C, 20). We then followed the pit outline as accurately as possible.
The oval pit was excavated about 30-40 cm into the slope, and the overall cairn from the
top to the pit bottom was estimated to be about 70-80 cm thick. We found no traces of
human remains or artifacts anywhere in the pit, but this certainly does not preclude that

19

some are present since we intentionally did not dismantle the entire cairn. Clearly there
was a significant reason to excavate the pit in the dense clay and cover and cap it with a
significant amount of rock.
Local folklore from an informant who lived as a neighbor to the Mandells (former owners
of the property) hand told Steve Lowe that it was his recollection that some Mexicans
had piled the rocks up as shrines. Further inquiry by Lowe, however, lead to the
informant owning up to the fact that the story was anecdotal and that he had no
information as to who constructed the cairns or when they may have been constructed.
Nevertheless, we chose to dismantle a portion of another cairn to confirm the findings of
our investigation of Cairn #4. We initially selected Cairn #8 because it appeared to have
been disturbed by dam construction. Upon investigation, however, we found that Cairn
#8 was so disturbed and provided little information other than the remnants of a shallow
pit beneath the rocks was detected. Therefore, we chose Cairn #12 for a further test on
the proposition that pits occurred below the rocks.
Cairn #12 measure 2 meters north-south and 1.4 meters east-west (Fig. 23A). The
methods used for the excavation of Cairn #4 were followed here as well in order to
accurately reconstruct the cairn after investigation. The northeast quadrant was removed
to determine if the rocks were filling and covering a pit. Also, we wanted to see if any
traces of bone or artifacts might be present. Like Cairn #4, the rocks were bleached
underneath indicating that this was not a recent rock pile. The excavation showed that the
rocks were indeed filling a pit that was excavated into the slope to a depth of about 20-25
cm (Fig. 23B). This pit was filled with rocks, and the entire rock mass was about 60 cm
thick from the bottom of the pit to the top of the cairn crest. No trace of bone or artifacts
was present.

Cairns: Definition and Distribution
Cairns Defined
The term “cairn” has been applied to a variety of heaped, mounded or stacked rock
features, large and small, that are reported around the world. These can be trail markers,
surveyors’ markers, graves, memorials, or large tombs. In Texas and parts of North
America, the term is usually applied to a heap of rocks that fill and cover a burial pit.
Some of these cairns are casually mounded stones of various sizes, while other cairns will
be marked by larger stones, sometimes stacked or more carefully placed. Cairns will at
times occur as single examples, or will in other cases, be clustered in some numbers
in a specific part of the terrain (e.g., hill or mesa top; high terrace overlooking a stream
channel).
Other rock configurations are also described as, or erroneously interpreted, as “cairns.”
These include piles of stones resulting from the clearance of fields, especially in central
Texas. Surveyors’ markers are indeed cairn-like in appearance in many cases. There are
also rock “stacks” reaching heights of about seven feet. These are known across the
Balcones Canyonlands; some are thought to be survey markers, while some are suggested

20

to be of Spanish Colonial age and of varied functions from marking treasure to holding
flags to guide explorers. One notable example of a stacked cairn is on the L. J. Haby
Ranch in northeastern Medina County. It rises to six feet, seven inches and has a
maximum diameter of eight feet. Another is published by Wilson (2006:30) from
Bandera County. “Shepherd stacks” common in the western United States are similar
kinds of features,
There is an extensive literature on the investigation of rock burial cairns in North
America. For example, Thom (1992) has carried out a detailed study of prehistoric burial
cairns on the Gulf of Georgia of the British Columbia coast. Though a long way from
central Texas, the definitions of the cairns that he has recorded are applicable to the
Joshua Springs examples at 41KE191.
Interestingly, in his excavations, one cairn
covered a grave pit but the human skeletal remains had disintegrated, and in another
cairn, only the remnants of human teeth were found (teeth are usually the last element of
the human skeleton to survive). His definitions include:
Full Cairn (C+): A large burial feature, often visible from the surface, with hundreds of
large boulders and cobbles completely covering and surrounding a shallow pit which
contains the burial. These are greater than 1.5 m in length or width.
Minor Cairn (C -): This class is composed of cairns made with numerous cobbles and
small boulders surrounding and covering the burial. These are not as massive as a "Full
Cairn", measuring 1.5 m or less in length or width.

Cairns in Texas Archaeology
The only other site with multiple cairns thus far reported in this part of Texas is in
northern Bandera County, west of the town of Medina (Daniel R. Potter, personal
communication, 2003). There are 12 cairns distributed in a linear pattern high on the
slope of a divide overlooking two creek valleys. Potter reports that the cairns have not
yet been systematically studied, but that they range in diameter from 1 to 2.4 meters and
had maximum heights of 40 cm. Like 41KE191, they are mounded and formed by
tabular limestone fragments.
Isolated cairns and perhaps sites with several cairns have been reported, albeit with
meager details, in Uvalde County. These range from cairns near the Mason Creek burial
cave, disturbed cairns in the Dry Frio River valley, and a “linear” cairn at 41UV318 on
the Little Seco Creek drainage (Decker et al. 2000:65-66; Maslyk 1993).
Cairn burials are also known from west central Texas, including the Robert Lee Reservoir
in Coke County (on a mesa top; 2.5 feet by 3.5 feet, and consisting of nine large cobbles;
Shafer 1967: Fig. 8), the Miller site in Coleman County (Reimenschneider 2001), and in
the O. H. Ivie Reservoir in Concho, Coleman and Runnels County (Godwin 1981; Lintz
and O’Neill 1993). Lintz and O’Neill (1993:633-659) detail the testing of a variety of
cairn types at 32 sites, with most sites having one or two cairns. Only 41CN94 (the
Miller site) had perhaps four separate cairns of prehistoric age (testing showed that one
cairn was an accumulation of rocks not associated with a burial). At 41CC237, the burial

21

of a child was found in a cairn-covered pit, and was radiocarbon-dated to 1525 B.P.
Godwin (1981) summarized the distribution of cairns in this region, as “cairn burials
commonly occur on alluvial terraces next to streams or on hilltops and ridged bluff tops.”
In the Lower Pecos and in the Trans-Pecos, burial cairns have often been noted (Turpin 1982;
Labadie 1993; Kenmostu and Wade 2002:123). A burial cairn was documented by Turpin
(1982:148) at Seminole Canyon State Park, at site 41VV364. The underlying pit did not
contain any surviving human remains. Soil samples were subjected to phosphate analysis,
using a technique that has allowed European archaeologists to recognize the presence of
Medieval burials – even though the skeletons had long decayed. Based on the types of
projectile points found with the cairn, it has been tentatively assigned to the Late Prehistoric
period.
In the Big Bend area of Trans-Pecos Texas, one site of particular note is the Rough Run site
(41BS884), where the cairn is roughly similar and size to the cairns of 41ME191 (Cloud
2002). It, like the much larger Las Haciendas cairn in Chihuahua (Mallouf 1987), contained
large number of Perdiz points of the Late Prehistoric era. These two cairn sites are linked to
the Cielo Complex (see Texas Beyond History, at www.texasbeyondhistory.net/transp/images/ap11.html).
In the southern Plains of Texas, Boyd (2004:310) notes the occurrence of “cairn-covered
graves” in the sites of the Palo Duro Complex in the Texas Panhandle-Plains, and a possible
pattern of burial cairns in the Blow Out Mountain phase, in west-central Texas (Boyd
2004:326).

Additional Backhoe Testing
Additional backhoe testing was carried out in four other fields (Fields 2-5). None located
buried archaeological deposits, but summaries of these tests and their locations are
provided below.
Field No. 2
This field (Fig. 2) was located on the west side of Allen Creek south of Field No. 1. Like
Field No. 1, this field also supported a dense stand and mat of coastal Bermuda grass
which provided no ground visibility. Therefore, two backhoe trenches (BHT#13 and
#14) were excavated to test the topographic features for evidence of a buried prehistoric
site.
BHT#13. The trench was placed at the north end of the field on the slope at the base of
the field. This location was considered to be a high probability area for a prehistoric site.
The GPS location for the trench is 0518029E/3305543N. The trench was 3 meters long
and 90 cm deep. One interior flake was observed in the uppermost bucket load of dirt but
no other indication of prehistoric activity was found such as more chipped stone or
burned rock. The flake was likely from a light surface occupation. The profile can be
described from the surface as follows:

22

0-15 cm:
15-40 cm:
40-90 cm:

Very dark grayish brown blocky clay, Munsell 10YR3/2.
Dark brown clay, Munsell 10YR4/3.
Yellowish brown clay with small gravels and an occasional
Rabdotus shell. Munsell 10YR5/4.

BHT#14. This trench was 3 meters long and 82 cm deep and located southeast and
slightly down slope from BHT#13 closer to Allen Creek. The GPS location is
0518047E/3305520N. The profile is the same as for BHT#13 and the description will not
be repeated here. No cultural material was observed in the trench or back dirt.
Field No. 3
This field is southwest of Field 2 near the southern boundary of the property. Two
backhoe trenches were excavated here, BHT#15 and BHT#16.
BHT#15. This trench is located near the creek in Field No. 3 at GPS location
0517677E/3305312N. The excavation was 3.0 meters long and 80 cm deep. The trench
was placed at the back of the field in order to determine if the lithic scatter from site JS-2
(41KE196), which was located on the limestone bluff west of the field, extended onto the
field. The test indicated that the lithic scatter did not extend to the field. No cultural
material was present. The profile read as follows:
0-15 cm:
15-35 cm:
35-80 cm:

Very dark brown clay, Munsell 10YR3/3
Dark brown clay, Munsell 10YR4/3
Yellowish brown granular clay, Munsell 10YR5/4

BHT#16. This trench is located north of BHT#15 in the same field. The GPS location
for the trench is 0517835E/3305293N. The excavated indicated that the gradual slope of
the field where the trench was located was composed mostly of colluvial deposits. No
cultural material was present. The profile described from the surface is as follows:
0-15 cm:
15-45 cm:
45-60 cm

Dark yellow brown clay with colluvial gravel, Munsell 10YR3/6
Yellowish brown clay mixed with colluvial gravel, Munsell
10YR5/4.
Dense gravel

Field No. 4
Field No. 4 is located on the east side of Allen Creek and southwest of Field No. 1 (Fig.
2). Two trenches were placed in this field, BHT#17 and BHT#18.
BHT#17. This trench was 3 meters long and 95 cm deep. It was located at
057996E/3305352N. The deposits were nearly homogenous very dark Krum silty clay

23

(Fig. 25). No cultural material was present in the deposits. The profile is described
follows beginning at the surface:
0- 25 cm:
25-45 cm:
45-90cm:

Very dark gray, Munsell 10YR3/1
Finer gray clay, Munsell 10YR4/2
Lighter gray clay, Munsell 10YR5/2

BHT#18. This short trench was excavated to test the slope at the north end of Field No. 4
to see if the deposits from 41KE196 extended into this field. No cultural material was
found in the shallow deposit of Krum clay that overlay a rocky colluvial gravel. No
profile was recorded for this trench.

Field No. 5
This field was extensively investigated as it was considered a high probability area for
archaeological sites. Seven backhoe trenches were excavated in this field and none
revealed evidence of buried cultural deposits (Fig. 24). A brief description of three of
these trenches is presented here.
BHT#19. Located in the northwest corner of Field 5, this trench was 2.5 meter long and
70 cm deep. A few fire-cracked rocks were observed in this area of the field and the
trench was excavated to test for buried cultural deposits. No cultural buried deposits
were observed, however. The GPS location is 0517600E/330570N. The profile is
described as follows beginning at the surface:
0-25 cm.
25-55cm.
55-70 cm.

Dark brown clay, Munsell 10YR3/3
Dark yellowish brown clay, Munsell 10YR4/6
Brown clay 10YR5/3, Munsell

BHT#20. During the pedestrian survey a buried A horizon soil was noted in the cut bank
of Little Joshua Creek. Since 41KE10 was associated with a buried A horizon, BHT#20
was placed 10 meters from the creek near the cut bank. The trench measured 2.5 meters
by 80 cm. No buried A horizon was observed in the trench profile, however, and no
cultural material was encountered.
The GPS location for the trench is
0517798E/3305690N. The profile, shown in Figure, is described from the surface as
follows:
0-15 cm.
15-40 cm.
40-80 cm.

Very dark grayish brown clay, Munsell 10YR3/2
Transition to a dark yellowish brown clay, Munsell 10YR4/6.
Dense gravel, Munsell 10YR5/3.

BHT#21. A noticeable rise was noted at the back of the field in the southeast portion.
This rise was tested with BHT#21 and discovered that the rise was in fact a small alluvial
cone emanating from a gap in the bluff to the south. The GPS location for this trench

24

which was 2.5 meters long and 80 cm deep is 517422E/3305902N. The soil profile was a
rather homogenous deposit of Krum soils, comparable to BHT#17 in Field 4. No cultural
material was present. The description beginning with the surface is as follows:
0-25 cm.
25-45 cm.
45-80 cm.

Very dark gray, Munsell 10YR3/1.
Dark grayish brown, Munsell 10YR4/2.
Grayish brown, Munsell 10YR5/2.

BHT#22-25. These four trenches were placed in the southeast portion of the field to test
two topographic rises. The deposits are all Krum soils and the profiles duplicate that
recorded in BHT#21. GPS locations for these trenches are as follows:
BHT#22. 0517581E/3305674N
BHT#23. 0517630E/3305622N
BHT#24. 0517616E/3305649N
BHT#25. 0517610E/3305688N

Summary and Recommendations
The Phase I archaeological survey of the Joshua Springs Park and Preserve identified
seven archaeological sites. Of these two merit potential nomination as State
Archaeological Landmarks (41KE10 and 41KE191), and both may well be worthy of
consideration for the National Register of Historic Places. Site 41KE10 is a large burned
rock midden associated with a buried cultural deposit that has excellent stratigraphic
integrity. Site 41KE191 is a very unusual site in that it consists of at least 21 rock cairns
that are presumed to be prehistoric burial locations. The reasoning behind this
presumption is that two of the undisturbed cairns were tested, revealing underlying pits
that would have been suitable to accommodate an adult burial. No human remains were
found but this is probably due to the fact that the pit was rock-filled and organic remains
would have decayed and deteriorated over several centuries. Our recommendations are
that neither site be subjected to any construction or heavy use activity. As for 41KE191,
it will be recorded as a State Archaeological Landmark and should be designated and
fenced as a restricted area that is entirely off limits. The type of fencing, its placement,
the possible use of interpretative signs, etc. will all be determined by the Texas Historical
Commission in discussions with the Kendall County Commissioners Court. Because of
the sensitivity of Native American groups, especially with regards to the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, several of which are very
active in San Antonio and are very concerned about the protection of burials and sacred
sites, the Texas Historical Commission (as does Kendall County) has the further
responsibility to demonstrate the comprehensive protection afforded to the cairns. It will
be necessary to set aside 41KE191 as a restricted area, and to adequately fence it to
protect the burial cairns from future disturbance or vandalism.
41KE10 is a very important site, but is located in a portion of the park property that will
not be impacted by construction or modification of the terrain. Because it is located on

25

public land, the Texas Historical Commission may very well designate it as a State
Archeological Landmark. Additionally, the Commission may wish to considerer
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places primarily because it has extensive
buried deposits and may preserve a rare opportunity to examine a Late Archaic house
structure.
The Texas Historical Commission letter of review for the draft report is presented in
Appendix II. This letter specifies that 41KE10 is eligible for listing as a State
Archeological Landmark and should be protected from public access. Site 41KE191, the
site of 21 burial cairns, is to be protected from public access by erecting appropriate
fencing to protect the features. The preservation plan for Joshua Springs Park was
prepared by Abasolo Archaeological Consultants and was submitted as a separate
document to the Kendall County Commissioners Court.

Mandell Site (41KE10) Field Notes
By

William A. Fawcett

45

Notes on Appendix 1
The following manuscript was provided to Shafer and Hester by William A. Fawcett in late
2007. The unpublished manuscript was compiled by him in 1969 following his investigations
at 41KE10. We have received permission from Mr. Fawcett to publish his field notes as an
Appendix to our investigations of the Joshua Springs Park and Preserve report. His notes add
significantly to our own investigations of the site and indeed provided the proper location for
the site. We have retained Mr. Fawcett’s original taxonomic scheme albeit with comments
where appropriate. We have functioned as “editors” here, by inserting in brackets, any updated
that better explains Mr. Fawcett’s findings. To conform with the terminology used in our
report, we have changed “burnt rock middens” to “burned rock middens”
Harry J. Shafer and Thomas R. Hester

46

Mandell Site (41KE10)

The Mandell site is a burned rock midden situated in Kendall County. It is on the upper terrace
of Allen Creek, a tributary of Little Joshua Creek, halfway between Boerne and Comfort near
Nelson City. The site is in a plowed field which has been plowed periodically since about
1900. The site has been surface collected for the last 20 years and the owner, Mr. Mandell, and
Mr. Doug Andrews together have collected around 400 artifacts from the midden area. Due to
the small number found in the excavation the author compared his findings to those of the
surface collections. The site measure 50 by 75 feet and forms a mound rising at least three feet
out of the ground. These measurements due to the excavated test pits seem to be exaggerated.
To the south of the midden there is a small overlapping Neo-American or Formative stage
[now called Late Prehistoric period] occupation which seems to be a common occurrence at
many sites in the area (Paul McGuff, personal communication on his Leon Creek survey and
Dan Fox, Rogers site manuscript). The sites is a maximum occupation thickness of 2.5 feet
even thought the black midden soil goes on down. The matrix consists of rock, gastropods,
and fine dusty black soil. Variances occurred only in the amount of rocks and gastropods
present.
Two five-foot square test pits were excavated by arbitrary six-inch levels with trowels and the
fill was screened. The squares were setup on a magnetic north axis and excavated at five foot
intervals on this axis which bisected the highest point of the midden.
If the plowing did not disturbed those below six inches, the artifacts represented show a strange
occupations pattern which Middle Archaic tools were used at a period of time primarily in the
Late Archaic phase of the Edwards Plateau Aspect. The artifacts from the surface (collected
by Mandell and Andrews) in order of importance [abundance?] consist of: Pedernales, Montell,
Williams, Castroville, Marcos, Frio, and other points, Ninety percent of these points were
whole. The projectiles also make up 95% of the total artifact count. Other artifacts include
foliates (bifaces), two percent, and two percent are various flakes and debris. This agrees
closely with the 30 artifacts found in the excavation of the test pits.
If one goes by the surface artifacts the site should date from the Middle Archaic Period. The
excavation showed differently where there was a sequence from oldest to youngest of Fairland
(1), Williams (2), Montell (1), This shows two possibilities: 1) the point is older than
originally thought, or 2) the point is out of place. The author believes the latter can be
excluded as well as the former a and that this site represents a very late use of Middle Archaic
points in a Late Archaic context [editors note: The point Fawcett identifies as Fairland is more
likely Uvalde or another form of “early stemmed” that are common Early Archaic type in this
area. If that identification is correct, the point is in its correct relative stratigraphic position].
The Neo-American occupation is represented by both Perdiz and Scallor points which are
representative of the Central Texas Aspect. [editor’s note: The Scallorn points identified by
Fawcett are now regarded as Edwards, a common arrow point type in the Balcones
Canyonlands; it is older than Scallorns perhaps dating around A.D. 700-900].

47

The author feels that the high percentage of projectiles shows an economy in which hunting
was of primary importance. No faunal material was found but at many sites deer and other
animal bones are present in great quantities (Paul McGuff and Mr. [Murray] Beadles, personal
communication). Gastropods [land snails, particularly of the Rabdotus species] were present
throughout the midden but at a depth of 1.5 feet they formed a solid three-inch layer. This may
have resulted (the author believes) only by human collection and gathering them.
Many opinions have been expressed as to why and how burned rock middens are created.
Some feel that making repeatedly of fire pits lined with rock and the rocks breakage from heat
created them. Others feel that they are just a big trash dump. The author feels that both of
these would be possible, however, the author feels that another possibility at least of this site is
that most likely way this midden was created. In his report on the Crumley site Kelly
expressed the idea that burned rock middens could have been created by its occupants cracking
the cortex off of flint nodules by firing. At this site this ideas is supported by the fact that 100
yards to the north of the site across Little Joshua Creek are several dozen small fissure caves
which extend back from the face of the cliff a maximum of five feet and are not over three feet
wide. Flint outcrops abound within these caves. Large limestone and flint talus slope has
formed. This area could have a preliminary quarry are which flit was removed with the cortex
still on and transported to the midden where it was cracked with fire and water. These caves
need to be inspected more closely in the future. (Editors note: Shafer and Hester field checked
Fawcett’s description of the cliff and caves and determined that his description and location
must have been confused with another locality. The only bluff with shelters on the property is
the site area described as 41KE193 and on the north side of Little Joshua Creek south of the
ranch house. There are no chert outcrops in these bluffs and there is no chert in the gravels of
either Allen Creek which is near 41KE10 or Little Joshua Creek.)
The major occupation of the site took place at a depth of seven inches and is represented by the
presence of both foliates (bifaces) and points.
By comparing the points to those from other sites and to the 1962 Type Handbook by Suhm
and Jelks, the midden probably dates from 1000 BC to 1000AD or the Late Archaic time
period. The economy seems to be centered on hunting although it seems likely projectiles and
other tools were made at the site. Some gathering might have also taken place.
