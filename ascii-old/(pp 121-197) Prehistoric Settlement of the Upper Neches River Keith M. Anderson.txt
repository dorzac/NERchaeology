PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT OF
THE UPPER NECHES RIVER
KEITH M. ANDERSON

ABSTRACT
During archeologicat survey in 1969 and

1970, 98 sites were located

along the upper Neches River in the area of Lake Palestine Reservoir. A
small

number of these are middle Archaic sites, interpreted as in-

termittently used hunting sites. Eighty-five sites have Caddoan ceramics.
One site cluster west of the river has Alto Focus pottery and is probably a
small village or hamlet belonging to the early Caddoan occupation of the
upper Neches. Remaining sites have Frankston Focus ceramics and include a number of settlements interpreted as permanent hamlet or village
localities. These are predominantly associated with streamside locations
near relatively fertile soils; the site situation described for the Hasinai,
who occupied the upper Neches historically. Other Caddoan sites are
suggested as equivalents of seasonally-uccupied localities in the Hasinai
settlement system.
Excavation is proposed to further test the settlement models suggested
for Archaic and Caddoan occupations, and the implications fur social interaction that derive from these mudels.

INTRODUCTION
This report focuses on patterns of site distribution in the upper
Neches River. Emphasis is placed on the structure and relationships
of late prehistoric Caddo communities. Preliminary attempts will be
made to formulate models to account for these settlement patterns
from which hypotheses can be derived for testing in excavation.
If the results of two surveys, the present one and an earlier one by
Johnson (1961) are reliable, the upper Neches River was inhabited
primarily by Caddo peoples. Little Archaic material has been found
and nothing earlier than "middle Archaic" is reported from the
reservoir area.
The Caddo occupation of the reservoir area may have been
relatively brief; it belongs primarily in the period of the Fulton
Aspect. This relatively brief occupation (perhaps A.D. 1100-1600) is
represented by a large number of small sites; a total of 122 have
been recorded in both surveys.
A general shift in settlement pattern typifies the Fulton Aspect
(Newell and Krieger 1949:194). This is a general dispersion of

122

population into small villages with loss of impressive mounds and
status burials of an earlier period (Gibson Aspect) which imply
nuclear centers of social control through ranked chieftains and
subordinates. It is the primary purpose of this report to provide a
background for systematic consideration of this trend, to describe
the archeological universe of the Upper Neches, and to isolate environmental, technological, economic and social variables which
give insight into elements of village life by which this state of Caddo
development can be characterized and compared with earlier settlements. The procedure followed is reflected in the organization of
the report follows these steps:
1. Determination of environmental resources, considered as an
ecological system relative to human occupation. This includes:
(1) association of natural resources with specific areas or zones
within the river drainage, (2) seasonal periods of maximum yield,
and (3) natural limitations such as climatic and soil productivity,
which affect their usefulness to man. This should result in a
statement of the environment as a set (or cyclical series of sets) of
boundary conditions which comprise fluctuating resources.
2. Abstracting from local and general ethnographic and archeological data the technological sequences, task group composition, residence units, and social group composition which may
be reflected in physical remains.
3. Analysis and presentation of
reference to the models and derive
cavation of specific sites within
procedure is to excavate sites not

site data from the survey, with
the problems to be solved by exthe reservoir. The aim of this
just because few sites of a par-

ticular period have been dug, and it is intuitively felt that more are
necessary, but because excavation will provide understanding of
cultural adaptation, adjustment, and development.

SURVEY CONDITIONS AND TECHNIQUE
The survey was carried out primarily during July and August of
1969 with additional recording during March, July, and August of
1970. This season has limitations since during the summer in east
Texas there is heavy plant cover which tends to obscure sites; it also
includes the driest and hottest part of the year. Consequently, the
sites were seen when conditions of flooding and water flow could
not be related directly to site distribution. However, the summer has
one distinct advantage in permitting observation of usable plant
resources in full leaf, though many nuts and fruits do not ripen

before fall.
The survey included both the proposed lake limits, the surrounding cleared zone following the 355 foot contour, and areas immediately outside the reservoir. A considerable amount of reservoirconnected construction and development threatens archeological
sites adjacent to the reservoir.
The survey was of an exploratory type, conducted primarily to inventory a maximum number of sites in a limited time. Total collection of surface artifacts was attempted at most sites; in many, the
surface artifacts were so few that limited controlled sampling would
have resulted in a very small collection. Most sites were collected as
a single unit, though sub-divisions were made in sites having obvious and discrete concentrations of artifacts correlating with
physical features of the site. Site dimensions were determined by
stepping off the site, or estimating the length and width of the area
marked by surface artifacts or the obviously limited landform with
which it was associated.

ENVIRONMENT
Descriptions of environmental features from the perspective of
human economy and settlement are presented here, focusing on:
(1) distribution of geological and biotic resources, (2) seasonal
cycles in the endemic biotic community, (3) contrastive elements of
topography, soils, and stream patterns, and (4) climatic fluctuation.
These elements form a series of environmental domains which
comprise resources and adaptive problems for indigenous human
populations. By deriving those problems in the perspective of
present environment and ethnographic and prehistoric data, models
can be developed which enable predictions of environmental
associations with specific cultural activities and settlements. These
should be reflected by survey and excavation data.
Components of the environment vary in spatial discreetness and
seasonal effect. However, at any given season at a particular
location, certain economic activities and human task groups are
more likely to have been found than others, and these groups may
be expected to be represented by a certain class of artifacts. The intent of this chapter is to abstract components of the natural environment with which we would expect particular human activities
to be associated.
The Lake Palestine enlargement includes the portion of the Upper

UPPER NECHES

125

Neches River between the towns of Cuney and Chandler, a distance
of slightly more than 17 airline miles. The enlargement, which will
ris to 345 feet msl., encompasses the river bottoms and slopes and
the lower drainages of the major tributary streams (Saline,
Kickapoo, Flat, and Ledbetter creeks). Variation in geology and
topography of the Neches valley are factors underlying localized
resources which effect human settlement. The following discussion
describes landforms, minerals, and soils and their usable resources.

TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY
The Neches River is a mature sluggish stream, meandering over a
floodplain with a maximum width of two miles, between rolling
convoluted uplands. The river is fed by a dendritic system of
tributary streams, some of which have developed their own broad
floodplains. This portion of the Neches flows across the Cenozoic
Gulf Coast Geosyncline, a thick succession of continental and
marine sediments with a low east-south-eastward dip (Sellards,
Adkins, and Plummer 1932:519-277). Consequently, the gentle dip
slope of the western uplands, deriving from the Queen City Formation, contrasts with the abrupt eastern escarpment slopes rising
60-80 feet above the river, and the river tends to hug the eastern
uplands. These eastern uplands are formed from the Neches member of the Mount Selman Formation which is capped by erosionresistant ferruginous beds (Mowery and Oakes 1959; Barnes 1964).
These outcrop as boulder fields and ledges and provide quarries of
sandstone of the same type used in tools found at archeological
sites. Topography in the east is more rugged than in the west, with
tributary streams forming relatively deep V-shaped valleys; in
stream valleys erosional remnants and terraces form a random
terrace structure.
Four Eocene formations -- Sparta, Weches, Queen City, and
Recklaw -- form the basic geologic resources of the upland soils adjacent to the Neches floodplain. The steep east terraces of the river
and some remnants west of the river are formed primarily of
Weches glauconitic sandstone and shale, upon which rests Sparta
sand (Mowery and Oakes 1959:45-47; Barnes 1964). Included in the
Weches Formation are limonitic and sideritic iron ore and hard
brown ferruginous sandstone which appears to have been a common resource for stone tools. The gentler slopes and terrace west of
the river are formed from Queen City micaceous sands, which in-

126

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

clude occasional ironstone concretions and ledges, and ferruginous
ledges and rubble (Barnes 1964). Other than the Brooks Salt Dome
in Saline Creek, which has been tapped in historic times by salt factories and is capped by Cretaceous layers of limestone, chalk, marl,
shale, and sand, there are no novel localized resources. Surrounding
geologic surface deposits are primarily sands and shales within a
radius of 30 to 80 miles.
Pleistocene terrace remnants, represented by exposures of sands,
silts, and gravel-bearing clays, are present on the west margins of
the floodplain, but in most cases they merge with the gentle upland
slopes and are topographicallynon-distinctive (Mowery and Oakes
1959:47). They are apparently the only local source of cryptocrystalline material suitable for chipped stone tools. These
deposits include pebbles and cobbles of flint, quartzite, and
petrified wood similar to some materials represented by debris and
tools found at archeological sites.
The floodplain has little relief, with subtle levees and shallow
backswamps. Occasional low erosional remnants, capped by sandy
soils similar to those of the uplands, rise above the bottomland floor.
These and the marginal slopes of the floodplains are the only bottomland locations where archeological sites were found. The
erosional remnants are least subject to seasonal flooding which occurs in April and May. In some locations, this flooding briefly extends aquatic fauna to the upland borders.
The meandering river channel varies from 50 to 100 feet in width.
At one point, it forms a small lake 200 feet long and 1-1/4 mile wide
(Big Eddy) which is heavily fished today by pole and trotline. Old
meanders (Flag Lake, ]ames Slough) and shallow floodplain basins
are filled by spring floods; during late July and August these sloughs
dry up, stranding large numbers of fish.

SOILS
The soils of the upper Neches drainage are of four basic types:
(1) sandy and clayey soils of the floodplains; (2) sandy and clayey
soils of the redlands; (3) soils with compact subsoils; and (4) sandy
soils with friable subsoils (Mowery and Oakes 1959:7).
Floodplain deposits -- recent alluvium -- include some fertile
soils but are not considered practical for present day farming since
they are frequently overflowed and poorly drained. Redland soils,
restricted to a few terraces on the eastern uplands, are the most fertile soils in the area; these are the areas having the most potential for

domestic crop yield and are associated with at least one large site
cluster along a small southeast tributary of Saline Creek
(X41SM15,21-25).
Soils with compact subsoils derive from the Recklaw Formation
and are infertile, shallow, draughty, compact, and hard to work.
They are commonly observed in uplands slopes (Mowery and
Oakes 1959). Soils with friable subsoils comprise the majority of
upland types and it is with this soil association that the majority of
archeological sites are found. Derived from Queen City and Sparta
sands, these fine sandy loams and loamy fine sands form a mosaic
pattern over the uplands. The best of these, such as Bowie fine
sandy loam, are low in fertility and very susceptible to leaching
though they are easily worked. Presently, much of farming in
special crops, field crops, and vegetables takes place in these soils
although heavy fertilization is necessary to produce high crop yields.
All soils, except those in the marshy bottoms, originally supported
hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood forest.
In summary, soils most suitable for farming in the present, and
probably in the prehistoric past, are the upland redland fine sandy
loams and the fine sandy loams of friable subsoils; the former is
most capable of supporting repeated cropping. Brown loamy sands
and sandy loams with friable subsoils would be exhausted quickly.
The Neches bottoms, partially cleared and flooded since completion of the dam in 1959, had little of the original plant cover at the
time of the 1969 survey and are presently cleared to the 355 foot contour which includes all the floodplain. Reconstruction of the river
valley flora is based on observations at the north and south borders
of the reservoir. Figure 2 shows the microenvironmental zones of
the upper Neches.
Zones 1 and 13, the uplands, include several topographic
variations, including headland slopes, erosional-remnant knolls,
terraces and terrace slopes, and ridges. The original mature forest is
inferred from pockets surviving among fields and young forest.
Dominant forms are red oak, post oak, shortleaf pine and loblolly
pine, mixed with hickory, blackjack and sand jack oaks, with a thin
undercover of broomsedge, small shrubs, bullnettle and grasses.
Fallow fields are quickly taken over by a dense cover of broomsedge, rosinweed, partridgepea, miscellaneous grasses, and
sassafras and persimmon bushes; red cedar occurs in open fields.
Understory growth in the upland forest includes a number of
vines and shrubs having edible fruits -- French mulberry (possibly
a recent introduction into the uplands), wild plum, chinquapin

UPPER NECHES

129

(dwarf chestnut) and several varieties of wild berries and grapes.
The upland complex extends downslope to the floodplain border
on both sides of the river and interdigitates with vegetation of the
drained bottoms. The western uplands are close to the western limit
of pines, lying 3 to 10 miles west of the Neches; major western
tributary streams (Kickapoo and Flat creeks) head up in oak-hickory
forest outside the reservoir, the eastern border of the Post-Oak
Savannah (Gould 1962).
In the better-drained bottoms, pin oak, water oak, pecan and
sweetgum form the upper story with some intrusions of post oak.
Giant reed is reported to have occurred in extensive canebrakes in
this zone; such pockets are now preserved only in watered upland
slopes.
Well-watered sloughs are bordered by dense marsh grasses and
reeds. In shallow backswamp areas, water hickory and water oaks
predominate. River and stream banks also have distinctive flora
dominated by black willow and willow oak.
Yield of edible fruits in the Neches forests begins in the late
spring (May-June) with a few species (Hawthorne, red mulberry
and wild plum) fruiting on uplands and stream broders. During
summer and early fall (July to September) more appear (elderberry,
muscadine, wild grape and bullnettle kernels). Autumn is the
period of greatest yield, primarily in nuts -- hickory, walnut, pecan,
chinquapin, ironwood and acorns; some of these trees hold their
nuts into winter. Berries and fruits available during the fall include
huckleberry, blackhaw, persimmons, hackberry, French mulberry
and buckthorn.

ANIMAL RESOURCES
Aquatic Fauna
The river is presently a plentiful source of fish, turtles, snakes,
and mussels. Species inhabiting the Neches River include: catfish
(channel, opelousas, blue); bullhead (black, brown, and yellow),
bream (green, bluegill, longear, common redear, spotted, goggle eye
sunfish), smallmouth buffalo, white perch, gar, mud pickerel,
bowfin, gizzard shad, common white sucker, redhorse sucker, and
golden shiner.
These fish vary in habits and amount of usable meat. Gar, gizzard
shad, suckers, and shiners are bony and have little food value. Other

130

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

common species run from 1/2 to 4 pounds, although the large catfish
(opelousas, blue) may attain weights of 50-60 and 20-25 pounds,
respectively (Zim 1963; Brown 1966). These large fish are found in
the deepest parts of the river like the Big Eddy.
An important potential source of aquatic fauna are sloughs formed in the backswamp and old meanders on the Neches bottoms.
These sloughs trap quantities of fish, snakes, and amphibians when
they dry up in late August. At James Slough, for instance, it is
possible to net or hand catch quantities of gizzard shad (the
predominant species), largemouth black bass, bullhead, all species
of sunfish except crappie and warmouth, carp, smallmouth buffalo,
bullfrogs, and crayfish (G. Garner, personal communication).
Predators attracted to these sloughs at this time -- also potential
game -- include watersnakes, turtles, and raccoons. These natural
fish traps are not confined to the bottoms; fish are similarly trapped
in pockets of intermittent streams.
In addition to fish, a number of other aquatic species are available
in the Neches drainage. In the original river and stream channels
mussels are plentiful. Soft shell and snapping turtles can be caught
by hand, set-hook or trotline. Slider turtles are wary and can only be
caught in traps. Crayfish inhabit sloughs, sluggish streams, and
shallow water. Frogs, (bullfrog, leopard frog, and green frog) are
ubiquitous water dwellers and hibernate during winter. Alligators
are also known to occur in deeper portions of the river.

Mammals
The whitetail deer is the largest (150-300 pounds) common mammal of the Lake Palestine region. Optimal range for the whitetail is
oak-hickory or pine-oak forest since hardwoods furnish acorns,
browse and cover (Teer 1963:29!. The American black bear is no
longer in the area but was seen in the last century. Bear denned in
canebreaks of giant reed of which only a few relict growths remain
that have not been grazed off by cattle. Eastern turkeys, another
species now extinct in the Lake Palestine area, survived in Smith
and Cherokee counties 50-60 years ago. They probably roosted in
the bottoms from October to February and appeared in the uplands
in the spring. Raccoon breed and feed along the river and its
tributary streams, but they range over the whole region.
Two indigenous species of rabbits occupy the Lake Palestine
region: the swamp rabbit (3-6 pounds) inhabits the bottoms, and the
eastern cottontail (2-4 pounds) lives in the uplands. Similarly, two

UPPER NECHES

131

species of squirrel live in the area. The smaller "cat" or gray
squirrel (ave. 14 oz.) is a high tree dweller of river and stream bottoms. The large fox squirrel (2 lbs.) is an upland dweller and is often found on the ground. The opossum (ave. 8 lbs.) inhabits both
uplands and bottoms and is the easiest land mammal to catch, particularly when he feeds on persimmons in the fall.
Birds
Waterfowl, migrating along the river and streams from October
through February include numerous species of ducks: mallard,
redhead, ruddy, masked, ring-necked, gadwall, American widgeon,
bufflehead, lesser scaup, pintail, blue-winged teal, green-winged
teal, American hooded merganser. The Canada goose passes
through during the winter and is found in the river. Coot and wood
duck inhabit the river and streams year-round. Of a variety of
upland game birds, snipe, woodcock, mourning dove and quail are
the best game birds and inhabit the region year-round.
CLIMATE
Climate of the Lake Palestine area is warm temperate, humid and
continental, modified by winds from the Gulf of Mexico (Mowery
and Oakes 1959:4). Summers are long and warm, and in 1969 in the
four counties surrounding the reservoir, the growing season was
recorded as ranging from 259 to 264 days with the last spring frost
occurring on May 7 to 11 and the first frost falling on November 7 to
November 11. Annual precipitation is slightly greater on the east
side of the river (Lindale, Smith County, 46.2", Rusk, Cherokee
County, 44.2") than at weather stations west of the river (Athens,
Henderson County, 40.~t"; Palestine, Anderson County, 40.7"). May
is the month of heaviest rainfall, followed by three dry months with
some increase in rainfall in November and December (Texas
Almanac: 1970:109-114):
In terms of environmental effects critical to human adaptation,
this climatic sequence is important for several reasons:
1. Other than amphibians and reptiles, animals do not hibernate
and are not hunted in dens. 2. Growing season is optimal, with the
summer lotlg enough for two corn crops although late summer
droughts can occur. 3. Dry summer months reduce water level
significantly making tributary streams poor sources of water; that is
the period when sloughs and shallow streams trap fish. 4. Early
spring rains and increased water flow produce spring floods which

132

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

for a short time extend the range of aquatic species and render the
river bottoms inaccessible.
ENVIRONMENTAL POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN OCCUPATION

Elements of the environment which are most specific and
discrete as factors influencing human settlement and movement in
the Neches are components of the river system -- the river,
tributary streams, and sloughs. Flood and high water table in the
bottoms limit sites that can be comfortably occupied year-round,
seasonally limit access into the bottoms, and render some soils impossible to farm. Shrinking sloughs and streams in late summer
create small distinct resources of trapped fish. Tributary streams are
frequent game runs; migratory waterfowl converge on the river and
sloughs in winter.
In biotic populations, there is a general contrast between drained
bottom, marsh, streamside, and upland, though bottoms and
uplands interdigitate and share a number of the same basic resource
types. Both support varied animal populations in addition to flora
yielding edible fruits and nuts. All species are available in a range
of 1/2 - 3 miles. In archeological sites it is to be expected that certain
species of animals will reflect different zones within the area -rabbits and squirrels occur in different species, differing between
uplands and stream and river bottoms.
Seasonal flux in resources and climate (Fig. 3) poses a number of
possible influences on human activities and movement. These shifts
are indicated: (1) fall dispersal into small parties for hunting and
nut collecting; (2) winter hunting requiring small hunting parties,
both for stalking deer and visiting specific river and slough
locations for waterfowl hunting; (3) spring fishing dispersed along
streams and rivers associated with collection of first fruits;
(4) farming from early spring to late summer, requiring work in
upland fields; (5) brief convergence on low streams and sloughs in
late summer to gather captured fish.

THE ETHNOGRAPHIC AND
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The following summary of Caddo culture is given as a basis for
abstracting technological series, economic activities and concommitant residence units, social groups, and principles of

UPPER

NECHES

133

organization for which we may expect to find evidence in the archeological sites in the upper Neches River. The ethnohistoric base
comprises, in order of increasing specificity, the total area of the
southeastern United States (Swanton 1946), the Caddo Indians
(Swanton 1942) and the Hasinai Confederacy (Griffith 1954;
Woodall 1969). The usefulness of this ethnographic data lies not
necessarily in a direct projection of cultural behavior into the
prehistoric past; doing so would negate the very real probability that
prehistoric cultures differed from the historic Caddo. Many classes
of data found in the archeological record are not recorded in
ethnohistoric sources; hence information and reconstructions from
excavation and survey comprise new data on the Caddo.
When survivors of the De Soto Expedition crossed the upper
Neches and Angelina rivers in the fall of 1542, the region was
inhabited by a group of 9 or 11 Caddo-speaking tribes loosely
associated in the Hasinai Confederacy. During the period 1687-1772,
a number of French and Spanish observers recorded the customs of
the Hasinai; their records have been summarized by Griffith (1954),
In using this data, it is necessary to bear in mind that this was a
period of rapid change for the Hasinai, largely due to the introduction of the horse by the Spanish in 1675. Accommodation to
the animal and its potential was rapid and by 1716 Griffith infers
that the Hasinai were "horse Indians". The mobility of horseback
travel, in conjunction with Hispano-French competition for the land
and its inhabitants, induced extensive culture change.
Griffith concludesâthat this changed the Caddo residence pattern
from continuous occupation of forest hamlets to shifting camps in
response to seasonal movement of game (Griffith 1954:43, 144-149).
Archeologically, this period should be marked by the presence of
European crafts, fewer sites, and evidence that economic activities
and locations were part of a migratory hunting pattern.
Notwithstanding this rapid change, the records of early observers
give data on pre-horse culture which can be used to interpret late
prehistoric sites and make some extended inferences to the period
before white contact and influence.
ECONOMY

The domesticated staple of the Caddo was corn, with beans
second in importance. Two varieties of corn were grown: an early
short-stalked variety which Swanton compares to popcorn was
planted in late April and harvested at the end of May. Following this

harvest, the fields were immediately cleared and a slower maturing
flour corn was planted to be harvested at the end of July (Swanton
1942: 129-131). Tilling implements were "hoes" or dibbles tipped
with hickory or with blades made from buffalo scapulae or deer
mandibles (Griffith 1954: 109-110). Gourds, melons, and sunflowers
were cultivated as well as five or six kinds of beans some of which
ripened in the spring (Swant0n 1942: 127-128).
Land clearing was carried out by large work parties of men and
women, apparently drawn from the whole village, who cleared and
dug the fields of household units one after another beginning with
the field belong to the Xinesi, then the caddi, and then fields of the
remaining villagers (Swanton 1942: 128-129).
The degree to which the Caddo depended on wild plant foods is
not clear from the ethnohistoric sources; but a wide variety was harvested. Wild fruits gathered included wild grapes, persimmons,
plums, blackberries, white and black mulberries, and maypops.
These were harvested by women who also gathered large quantities
of nuts and acorns in the fall and early winter. These provided a
resource, along with shelled corn and beans, that could be stored
into the winter (Swanton 1942: 132-134; Griffith 1954: 121).
A number of animals were hunted, but records are vague concerning hunting group composition and organization. Elaborate
ritual preparation prior to deer hunting was customary, and deer
were apparently stalked and shot with bow and arrow by men using
disguising headdresses. Deer were brought back to the village to be
skinned and butchered. One chronicler, Casanas, indicates that deer
and prairie chicken were hunted only in winter time. Ducks and
geese were certainly hunted only during this period (Griffith 1954;
112-113; Swanton 1942: 134-137).
Fishing was a group occupation which began with warm spring
weather, apparently involving extended family units (referred to as
"families" in the literature). At this time, families moved for several
days to productive fishing spots and lived on their catch while
cooking quantities to carry back to the village (Swanton 1942: 138).
According to Griffith, fishing was especially important in late summer when drought-diminished streams trapped fish in shallow
pools (Griffith 1954: 113). Techniques of fishing are not described
specifically for the Caddo, except for a. reference to trotline fishing
by the Nachitoches (Swanton 1946: 340). However, a wide variety of
fishing techniques was used throughout the southeast, including
weirs, hook-and-line, nets, snares, arrows, spears, poison, drags,

136

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

and "grabbling" (catching with the bare hands) (Swanton 1946: 332340), and it is presumed that the Caddo used these techniques.
From the above description, it is suggested that spring fishing
groups were likely to be small while late summer fish-catching involved or had the potential for larger units, probably drawn from
matrilocal households whose core members would be related
women.
Apparently buffalo were hunted year-round though major hunts
were planned for the winter season. The nearest buffalo plains were
said to be more than 40 leagues distant from east Texas and the best
hunting grounds were found only beyond the Brazos.
Materials Used in Technology
Plant and animal resources provided material for most native
technology. Plants -- reed, canes, and wood -- were the most common materials used in crafts followed by clay and animal materials.
Food preparatâion, for instance, was accomplished with wooden
mortars, clay pots, reed screens, and baskets. Food was served in
pottery bowls and on woven platters, and pipe smoking was an after-meal ritual. References to stone artifacts are almost absent from
the record; arrowheads and cutting tools can be inferred but are not
described. No pottery vessels accompanied men on the hunt; their
food rested on the ground on leaves or on their own feet.

Division of Labor
Subsistence tasks: although initial land clearing was done by all
villagers, male and female, Hasinai women did most planting,
cultivating, harvesting, cleaning, and storing of crops. They
prepared game, gathered wild foods (including nuts and acorns in
the fall), ground meal in wooden mortars and cooked food. The only
subsistence tasks specifically named as male activities are hunting
and clearing and breaking soil for planting.
Crafts: early journals note that craft making was carried out
primarily in cold rainy periods in the village. Women made mats,
baskets, and 15ots; men made bows, arrows, moccacins, and farming
tools (Griffith 1954: 121; Swanton 1942: 162-163). Housebuilding was
a community activity in which men and woman of all households
were required to participate (Swanton 1942: 149-152).

Structures and Communities
The basic Hasinai settlement was a scattered series of house

UPPER NECHES

137

clustering into named hamlets. Depending on the importance of the
household head circular thatched houses varied in size up to 60 feet
in diameter. These dwellings had a central hearth, and beds lined
sections of the wall; other walls were taken up with shelves, pots,
and baskets where domestic utensils (mortars, pestles, cookware)
and food (corn, beans, nuts, and other foods) were stored (Swanton
1942: 148-153).
Apparently most houses were multi-family dwellings. Woodall
(1919: 20), reviewing historic and ethnographic literature, infers that
dwellings housed extended families and the dominant residence
pattern was uxorilocality (see also Griffith 1954: 101). House sites
were selected close to a location suitable for cropping and a stream
providing drinking and bathing water (Swanton 1942: 163-164).
Political Organization
Like much of Caddo culture, political organization is outlined
only sketchily by European observers. There is, however, indication
that social stratification existed. Gasanas, the first missionary to the
Hasinai, indicates a series of ranked statuses:
Xinesi - Pan-tribal religious leader
Caddi - Tribal leader
Canahas - Criers
War Captain
Chayas - Subordinates to the Canahas
Tammas - Work group supervisors
Both the Xinesi and the Caddi were inherited positions, and their
wives were designated by a special title (Swanton 1942: 170-171).
The basis of this inheritance may well be a system of ranked clans,
which was indicated to Swanton in about 1910 by an elderly informant. Five "clans" were named which were not consistently
exogamous; a male child belonged to either his fatherâs or his
motherâs clan, whichever was the "strongest" (Swanton 1931). Informant discussion of clans is inconsistent, but clans are mentioned
by several sources (Swanton 1942: 163-166), leaving little doubt that
they existed.
The interpretation of ranked status is difficult to solve; Woodall
views the Caddi as a "big-man" leader (Sahlins 1968: 86-95) who
retained his leadership through generosity and kinbased obligations.
This contrasts with a "chief" as Service has developed the type
whose re-distributive role invests him with political authority
(Service 1962: 170). Such a role can be easily imagined to apply to
the earlier Caddo sites with earthworks and status burials. At the

138

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

present state of knowledge, the status of the Hasinai Caddi is still
not entirely clear. As the succeeding section of the report indicates,
there may be status ranking indicated by burial patterns although of
a more attenuated form than in early Caddo sites.
Burial ritual, abstracted from several ethnographic sources, dating
from initial contact to Parsonâs 1927 notes ($wanton 1942: 203-209)
shows a pattern which coincides closely with the archeological data.
Burials were interred singly near the house following a ritual whose
elaboration and duration depended on the status of the deceased.
Important "chiefs" (probably Caddi) took longer to bury; a Xinesiâs
burial required performance of ceremonies by all tribes. Burial
goods indicative of hierarchical status are not described; it is mentioned only that men are buried with bows, arrows, and other hunting implements and woman are buried with pottery vessels.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The dominant type of settlement in the Palestine Reservoir area is
a small site or site-cluster attributable to Caddo populations.
General summaries of the Caddo sequence have been published in
several sources (cf. Davis 1970: 35-58; Orr 1952; Suhm 1954: 151-227;
and Webb 1960: 48-54). These describe a general trend contained in
the transition from the Gibson Aspect to the Fulton Aspect marked
by abandonment of large nuclear centers with special ceremonial
structures, loss of elaborate status burials, and dispersal of
populations into small scattered villages.
Prior to the present salvage project, research in the area of
Palestine Reservoir consisted of excavation of esoteric sites like a
"perpetual fire site" (Jackson 1936), amateur excavations of burials,
and Johnsonâs survey (1961). From the 35 sites Johnson located, one
was designated an Archaic site ($41 He 35), and one (X41 $M 28) included multiple burials with Alto Focus pottery and six single interments with Frankston Focus vessels. Two other sites (X41 $M 16,
X41, $M 17) were tentatively designated as Alto Focus sites, and 28
of the remaining ceramic sites contained Frankston Focus pottery
types. To date, no historic sites with trade goods have been identified in this part of the upper Neches.
Previous excavations are primarily useful for indications of
ceremonial activities and status indicated in burial patterns. Jackson
in 1931 and 1935 excavated a large ash mound and a midden
overlying a large circular house pattern at the A. C. Saunders site,
approximately 3 miles west of Lake Palestine dam (Jackson 1936).
This site is still visible on a level upland field close to the western

UPPER NECHES

139

border of mixed pine-oak forest. Jackson made a careful comparison
of the archeological remains with the descriptions of Hasinai
ceremonial structures by Espinosa and Morfi and suggested that the
site was a temple.
Two burial sites were reported by Johnson, and the author has
visited the locations of two additional sites that had been removed
by bulldozing, local amateurs and pothunters. These give general
patterns of burial ritual from which some inference concerning
status and community type are suggested.
Excavations by amateurs ha~;e uncovered single and multiple interments for early and late periods within the reservoir. At X41 SM
28 (41 SM 73-UT), a low bench above Saline Creek, six single interments and a multiple burial with four individuals were excavated. All burials were apprently in shallow pits, ranging from 24
inches to 40 inches below level ground surface. Details of ceramic
vessels are not known, but the multiple burial is adjacent to the
single graves which were spaced in a north-south row indicating
that this was an established burial location. Rows of single interments are characteristic of a number of Frankston Focus interments excavated in the 1930âs near Poynor, Texas, east of Lake
Palestine (R. K. Harris, personal communication). Vessels found
with the multiple burial are identifiable as, or similar to, pots from
the T. M. Sanders Site (Sanders Focus) or the George C. Davis Site
(Alton Focus). No other artifacts were recorded.
At X41 SM 6 (41 SM 77-UT) two single graves were excavated
from a site approximately one mile up Saline Creek from X41 SM
28. One burial included a Ripley Engraved bottle, two Poynor
engraved bowls, two effigy vessels, eight Perdiz points, a small celt
and a large biface. The second grave contained two Poynor
Engraved bottles, one plain carinated bowl, one effigy bowl, a small
Poynor Engraved bowl, another undescribed vessel, and six Perdiz
points (Johnson 1961: 219-224; field notes from survey of Blackburn
Crossing Reservoir).
The author recently visited two burial locations destroyed in September, 1970, by construction on the banks of County Line Creek
and one of its small tributaries. The site on the main stream apparently had one multiple burial in a pit 12 feet wide, which contained three skeletons; a cluster of four burials lay 21 feet downslope from this. These were approximately 50 meters west of two
surface artifact concentrations associated with middens.
The four burials were reported to come from a single pit but,

140

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

since the area covered by the graves is 21 feet across, they may have
been single graves. Twenty-one pottery vessels of Frankston Focus
types, one celt, and a slender bifacial tool ("Jowell Knife") were included in the triple burial. Basket or matting impressions were also
reported. The items recovered from the four burials included pottery, projectile points and two pipes.
Two burials have been obliterated by constr~uction on a south
tributary of County Line Creek; a few details have been reported by
local informants. One burial contained one individual and six
Frankston Focus pottery vessels. Upslope from this was apparently
an Alto Focus multiple burial with three small clusters of pottery
associated with bone and tooth fragments.
The burial pattern clearly shows a preference for streamside
locations; in some cases graves lie on the periphery of prehistoric
settlements. Multiple burials are apparently most characteristic of
Alto Focus graves, and single interments predominate in Frankston
Focus sites. There is some suggestion that multiple interments persisted in the later period of occupation. Status implications depend
on data (sex, age, artifact associations) that have not been determined; however, if multiple burials persist into a later period of occupation, this may represent continuation of ranked status. Such a
situation, in which the death of a high-status individual occasioned
the burial of other individuals, has been recorded at late sites on the
Red River (Skinner et al. 19691.

SUMMARY
As the preceding outline indicates, the Caddo sites of the upper
Neches offer an opportunity for research centering on the
dichotomy between Alto Focus and Frankston Focus as culture
types and the shifts in economy and society which may be represented by these types. Knowledge of the internal structure of small sites
in each period is necessary to determine whether the occupation of
the Neches in these two periods represents two distinct adaptations
and social types. In burial patterns, single interments are generally
characteristic of Frankston Focus sites, but the presence of multiple
burials indicates that some status differentiation may be present
and status may not be qualitatively different from the Alto occupation. The interpretation of the A. C. Saunders Site as a
ceremonial structure is plausible, but requires comparison with
other archeological site types -- camps and dwellings -- for

UPPER NECHES

141

validation and satisfactory definition of prehistoric settlement components.
Economy of the Neches prehistoric Caddo is not known. Corn
was grown at the Davis Site, but its cultivation at Lake Palestine is
yet to be proved. The large number of small sites in the reservoir
may include a variety of activity -- specific camps as well as village
sites near which fields were cultivated.
Based on the ethnohistoric literature, environmental data, and archeological data from the upper Neches, a pattern of settlement is
inferred for the Hasinai and their prehistoric predecessors (Fig. 4).
It is quite possible that all these elements of the settlement system
are included in the reservoir. This representation excludes the winter buffalo hunting camp which would be considerably outside the
reservoir area.
Villages contained dwellings occupied by extended families.
There is evidence that matrilocatity was the principle under which
households were grouped. In or near dwellings a wide range of
economic tasks were accomplished, including butchering, cooking,
food-storage, food grinding, pottery making, basket weaving, and
arrow making. Caddiâs houses were likely to be the largest and were
the scene of visits from foreign emissaries; hence they should contain non-local artifacts.
These dwellings were apparently occupied year-round except for
early spring and late summer, when families moved to fishing spots,
and during winter buffalo hunts.
Of the hunting, gathering, and fishing activities in the immediate
reservoir area, only one -- fishing -- involves whole families and is
likely to Be represented by both menâs and womenâs tools. The
records suggest that fishing spots were visited for relatively brief
periods during spring and summer and varied in location depending on the stage of flooding and condition of the river. These
localities, if they are detectable in the ethnographic record, should
be relatively small, show a marked percentage of fish bone and
aquatic species, and a relatively small range of ceramic attributes in
keeping with small kin-based groups.

THE SITES
Table 1 lists the 98 sites visited during 1969 and 1970. Those with
University of Texas at Austin designations were originally recorded
in 1957 by Johnson and were re-visited during the present survey.
Sites X41 AN 6-8 are not described, although they are shown on the

site map, because they were recorded and surface materials were
collected by grids in 1970 while excavation was in progress at
nearby sites: They will be described in an excavation report.
Similarly, historic salt factories ($41 SM 1-4,35,36) are not described;
they are included in a separate publication (Skinner 1971).
Site area refers to the surface extent of artifacts unless marked by
an asterisk; these sites include dimentions of the landform on which
the site rests. Sites for which dimensions were not recorded are
marked "N.D.".
Microenvironmental units are those previously described and
shown in Figure 2. Site situations and settlement types are summarized and defined in the succeeding section on site distribution.

SITE DISTRIBUTION AND IMPLICATIONS
Review and comparison of the sites and their distribution in Lake
Palestine Reservoir are directed toward the following questions:

(1) Do artifact assemblages or sets which represent distinct activities correlate with components of the environment to suggest
functionally disparate units within a settlement system? (2) Do the
Caddoan sites within the reservoir conform to the Hasinai
ethnographic pattern?
Surveyed sites have been grouped into a series of activity-sets to
test whether these sets, designated in terms of components of a settlement system, show discernible patterns of environmental
association (Table 2).
In categorizing activity-sets, an attempt has been made to consider sites as integrated wholes in which site area and artifact concentration is considered, as well as the relative frequency of different activity-elements and the presence or absence of specific
traits. Site area and artifact concentrations are approximate, since
horizontal distribution of artifacts was not consistently recorded,
and surface cover varied from site to site. In a number of cases the
artifact sample is very small. However, if a number of such small
assemblages occurs repeatedly in particular environmental contexts
they achieve more reliability and indicate that a patterned activity is
represented.
Site assemblages are grouped into seven classes: chipping scatter,
hunting station, gathering station, hunting/gathering camp, sherd
scatter, camp/settlement and base settlement.
SITES OF TEMPORARY OCCUPATION
A. Chipping Scatter. These are suggested as brief stops by one
hunter or a small group of hunters during which tools were made or
finished. The only .artifacts are a few (3-13) pieces of stone debris, in
some cases with a finished projectile point or biface fragments. The
maximum site dimensions are 30 meters. Debris consists of secondary flakes at all-sites except X41 SM 11, which has one cortex flake.
B, C. Hunting Stations. Probably intermittently occupied sites at
which resource cobbles or blanks were made into finished tools,
and broken points were replaced. Most are extensive sites, from 90
to 200.yards in maximum dimensions. Large samples of chipped
stone debris and tools are the sole or predominant artifacts. The full
range of debris, from core to cortex flake to finished projectile
points, is represented and some projectile point stems occur. Two
sites have a single grinding tool (mano or basin), one has a pitted
stone, and some have a small number of sherds. Sites without
projectile point stems (B) are listed separately from those with
broken stems (C); the latter have heavier occupational debris and

UPPER NECHES

are more likely to have been repeatedly or intensively used.
D. "Gathering Station". Isolated pitted stones or grinding platforms, indicating one person or a small group grinding and
probably gathering wild plant food and nuts on a transient or
seasonal basis. These occur with or without a small number of
sherds (19 or less).
E,F,G. Hunting/Gathering Camps. Small lithic sites at which chipped stone tools were made, occasionally projectile points
replaced, and vegetable foods processed. Site extent varies from 1/4
acre to 100 meters in extent. One site (X41 He 35) shows two artifact
clusters differing in the occurrence of primary debris. At the cluster
having only secondary debris an anvil was collected. In addition to
lithic debris, these sites have unfinished points, occasional base
fragments, pitted stones and pitted manos. Four of the five sites
(category F) have the full sequence of lithic manufacture represented; one site (X41 Ce 16) has only secondary debris (category E).
One extensive site (category G) covers a bluff 400 wide x 900 meters
long. A full range of lithic debris was collected from this site
although primary elements are few. Unfinished chipped stone tools
and all categories of crushing and grinding tools are represented.
Two sections of the site have a relatively small number (18, 39) of
sherds. The presence of Archaic dart points suggests a pre-Caddoan
component. The extensive distribution of artifacts suggests that this
location has been frequently re-occupied by hunting and gathering
parties.
H. Sherd Scatter Stations. Sites at which only sherds were found;
the number varies from 1-32, and sites vary considerably in extent;
most cover less than 50 meters. Some of these may represent outposts at farmed fields. In the absence of hunting tools, tool manufacture, and ground stone tools, they are presumed not to have been
hunting and gathering camps or base settlements.

CAMP OR SETTLEMENTS OF MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES
Ceramics are predominant at these sites; pottery was probably
made at all locations. Stone tool production and vegetable food
processing is represented. These are the sites with the greatest number and largest variety of tools, indicating permanent occupations.
However, ceramic sites vary in size and activity; either seasonal
camps or base settlements may be represented. They are ordered in
several classes by variations in site scale and range of activities
present:
I. Small sites, up to 50 meters in maximum extent, which lack

crushing and grinding tools. Sherds are dominant (8-97); secondary
lithic debris, and occasional finished tools or point body fragments
are a minor part of the assemblage. Since crushing and grinding
tools are absent and hunting tool manufacture and use is minor,
some of these may be temporary camps.
J. A site (X41 HE 40) with a small number of sherds, a core, and
fragments of daub indicating a permanent structure. This may be a
permanent residence.
K. Small-to-medium sites with 5-98 sherds, crushing and grinding
tools, (pitted stones, pitted manos, grinding basins) and small quantities of secondary debris. Most are relatively small, though one is 90
meters in length. The range of activities represented suggest that
these may be small base settlements.
L. Small ceramic sites, less than 70 meters across with 32 to 82
sherds and small amounts of primary debris.
M. Extensive sites, probably base camps, up to 200 meters across
with a large sherd sample (100-381), very few primary or secondary
flakes or unfinished tools, and pitted stones.
N. Base settlements, usually 50 meters or less in extent, with a
small sample of unfinished tools and full lithic debris. A wide range
of crushing and grinding tools are present, including pitted stones,
manos, and grinding platforms. Sherd samples range from 51 to 596.
O. The largest and most intensively occupied sites; these are all
probably base settlements with several permanent residences. They
range up to 300 meters in maximum extent, have a relatively large
number of sherds (38-439), ceramic pipe fragments, full lithic
debris, finished chipped stone tools, and a variety of crushing and
grinding tools.
P. Small ceramic sites, of the same order and content as
categories I and F, with the addition of pipe fragments. These may
be either campsites or settlements; the presence of pipes is taken as
an indication of group ceremony, in the context of a smaller group
or more brief occupation than base settlements at which intervillage or tribal ceremonies presumably occurred. Site size is small,
no more than 50 meters in maximum dimensions, and sherd samples are usually small (13 to 18 sherds). Crushing and grinding
stones are absent except at X41 SM 23, which has one pitted stone.
One site (X41 HE 24) has 182 sherds and a small amount of primary
lithic debris. Remaining sites have no lithic material or minimal
debris (1 or 2 chips).
DISTRIBUTIONAL PATTERNS
Site locations in Table 2 are grouped according to their occurrence

east or west of the river, to test whether differences in site types
correlate with contrasts between east and west uplands in
topography, lithic resources, soil types, and proximity to the eastern
border of pine-oak forest. In addition, site locations in environmental zones 1 and 13, the interior uplands, are differentiated
by their occurrence on streamside bluffs, interior ridges or knolls or
upland flats, to determine if propinquity to streams governed settlement type.
As Table 2 shows, no sites were located on the river bottoms. All
sites are in zone 1-4 (western uplands, and floodplain borders) and
10-13 (eastern uplands). Hence all sites are potentially occupable
throughout the year without threat of flood. There is the possibility
that some sites may have been covered by alluvium although sites
were exposed on the alluvial slopes of the floodplain borders.
Chipping scatter sites show a slightly greater association with
streamside locations expected from hunting activities than isolated
interior sites, but they appear in other location. Hunting stations are
more restricted in distribution than other site localities; all are on
the western rim of the flood plain to which easy access is gained to
the floodplain or river. In several cases, in locations south of Cany
Creek, these sites are near Pleistocene terraces, and the usable stone
in terrace gravels was probably a determining factor in the choice of
sites. A relatively high proportion of local quartzite debris occurs at
these sites and is similar to material found on the terrace cobble
deposits. Three of the sites are close to good fishing localities: X41
AN 2 lies a short distance from the river, X41 HE 11 occupies a low
terrace a short distance from the Big Eddy, and X41 HE 35 is close to
a small slough and tributary stream. Other sites are not in close
proximity to fishing localities, but their location on the boundary
between floodplain and upland places them in an optimal location
for hunting both upland and bottomland species. Sites with stem
fragments (X41 TA 2, X41 HE 11, X41 HE 17) all have Archaic dart
points and represent early hunting stations; some of the same
locations have Caddoan ceramics, suggesting multiple occupations.
Gathering stations, isolated finds of pitted stone or grinding
basins, show a wide distribution with a preference for interior
upland localities. This distribution is what would be expected if
these sites involved wild nut-gathering, since nut-bearing hardwoods are ubiquitous.
Base camps or base settlements, as well as most ceramic campsettlement sites, are the most common and occur most frequently in
the situation expected from the ethnographic literature -- streamside flats with relatively fertile soils.

161

UPPER NECHES

Since artifacts preserved at these sites are not those analogous to
those used in Caddo horticulture, inference that base settlements
are farming villages must be based on indirect evidence. One of
these is association with fertile soils. According to ethnohistoric
reports, Hasinai settlements Were customarily located near streams
and land suitable for farming. If the Neches River Caddo were
established farmers, as they appear to have been at the George C.
Davis Site and at Hasinai villages, they can be assumed to have been
able to judge relative soil productivity. Lacking this pre-judgement,
relative crop yield would have demonstrated the better farming
locations. Hence, it is expected that probable village sites (base settlements) will be associated with good soils.
To rate soil productivity, soil types classified by the Soil Conservation Service were obtained for each site locality. These types
are ranked on the basis of fertility, depth of subsoil, slope, erosion
potential, and potential for flooding. Erosion potential and porosity
are of primary concern for present-day farmers who practice
repeated cropping with commerical fertilizer. We can assume that
Caddo swidden involved cropping a field until production dropped
below a certain level, and the field was let fallow. Hence, original
fertility would be the deciding factor in soil productivity. Soils
associated with archeological sites are categorized as low (L), low to
moderate (L-M), or moderate (M) in fertility (Mowrey and Oakes
1959).
Table 3 shows the relative fertility of soils with which all activitysets are associated. Base settlements are clearly associated with better soils. Furthermore, Caddo settlements (sets K, M-P) occur in one
location, the floodplain borderâ, which is shared by no other sites.
These sites, with the exception of those (K)
points, have complete tool kits, including
stones and some lithic debris. They are likely
tlements rather than camps. The alluvial soil

which lack projectile
crushing or grinding
to have been base setat the floodplain bor-

der, among the best in the upper Neches region, is sugggested as a
primary factor in choice of these sites.

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS OF THE UPPER NECHES
On the basis of pottery types and projectile point types, three
periods of occupation are indicated represented by Archaic, Alto
Focus, and Frankston Focus types. However, a number of sites
lacking "index fossils" in the form of distinctive pottery or point
types cannot be ascribed to a particular period; these "timeless"

sites include chipping sites and isolated pitted stones or grinding
stones.
Archaic base camps are restricted to the western side of the river;
the primary activities represented in technological remains are toolmaking and hunting. By their proximity to Pleistocene terraces and
riverine resources, it is suggested that fishing and stone cobble
collection were additional activities that took place at these sites.
These Archaic sites include gray flint projectile points but lack
cores and cortex flakes of this material. It occurs in secondary
debris, retouched flakes, biface blanks, scrapers and dart points. A
central Texas origin for this flint has been suggested. If this is true,
these sites may represent a seasonal round of small hunting and
gathering bands whose territory extended west beyond the upper
Neches drainage. This is suggested by the distribution of all Archaic
points~ which, in addition to their concentration in hunting camps
with primarily lithic components, are more common in all sites on
the western side of the river. Twelve sites lying west of the Neches
River have dart points. Only three sites are~on the east side of the
river. Furthermore, these eastern three sites include only Gary and
Ellis dart points; the use of these forms may have persisted after the
introduction of ceramics (Suhm et el. 1954: 188). Sites representing
other activities in the seasonal round of these archaic bands may lie
considerably west of the Neches drainage, possibly beyond the oakpine-hickory forest in the Post-Oak Savannah or Plains where buffalo was the principal large game.
Earliest Caddo sites in the reservoir area are limited to burials on

UPPER NECHES

163

the eastern side and small clusters of base camps or settlements
west of the river near the mouth of Caney Creek. These sites lie on
or near the fertile floodplain border soil with which no sites are
associated prior to Caddoan occupations. It has been suggested that
this part of the river bottom environment attracted permanent settlement because of the farming potential of this soil. This Alto Focus
Caddo population was much more sparse and scattered than in succeeding periods. The closest Alto Focus site observed by the writer
outside the reservoir is located on Caddo Creek, a western tributary
of the Neches six miles south of the Caney Creek cluster.
The primary occupation of the upper Neches is represented by
Frankston Focus sites which account for 81 of the 85 ceramic sites.
The largest are base settlement clusters on streamside flats with fertile soils in the eastern uplands. Other site types include scattered
sherds, gathering stations in which pitted stones are found with a
few sherds, and small campsites. The range of site types suggests
villages, small hamlets, and temporarily occupied activity-specific
sites separate from the permanent villages.
From the Caddoan literature, several elements of the settlement
system have been inferred for the historic Hasinai including farming hamlets, spring fishing stations, and late summer fishing
camps. These apparently consisted of matrilineal kin-affiliated task
or residence groups and are the elements of this sytem most likely
to be represented archeologically by camps or settlement sites.
Other activities in the seasonal round (winter waterfowl hunting,
deer hunting, and fall nut gathering) involved exclusively male or
female groups and would be expected to be represented by much
less archeological residue. Archeological sites representing these activities are probably chipping stations and gathering stations. The
site class most likely to represent a spring or late summer fishing
camp are streamside or floodplain camps or settlements (Class I).
There are slightly more of this site type in this locality than
elsewhere.
Base-settlement clusters vary in size and number of activity-sets;
this variation could be accounted for by specific activity or work
localities .within the hamlet. In addition, the density of occupation
apparently varies in direct proportion to the fertility of the soil.
A site cluster on Saline Creek, including sites X41 SM 15, 22-25
occupies an upland flat approximately 500 meters across at the junction of two streams. The soil is a fertile red sandy loam (Magnolia
Fine Sandy Loam). The sites include four base settlements ranging
in size from 50 x 100 meters to 120 x 160 meters, and one small

164

station with one chip, a grinding basin and four sherds. One base
settlement, X41 SM 22 includes a small scatter of sherds and debris
slightly apart from the major portion of the site, suggesting a
separate activity area. A cemetery (X41 SM 28) has been excavated
by amateurs approximately 1/2 mile downstream and a burial is
reported to have been removed from a stream bank at the end of one
site.
A cluster on a tributary of County Line Creek (sites X41 CE 1-5)
includes one extensive base settlement (X41 CE 1) and a smaller
camp or settlement on a moderately fertile sand flat (Bowie loamy
fine sand), at the head of a small stream. Three other sites -- a small
scatter of sherds, a small camp or settlement, and a grinding platform with 11 sherds -- occupy slopes and ridge crests overlooking
the flat.
A third cluster on Chimney Creek consists of three extensive base
settlement sites (X41 CE 10,11,16) along a 3/4 mile length of the
creek. Soil here is a fertile red sandy loam (Magnolia/Nacogdoches
fine sandy loam). Sites range from 100 x 350 meters to 100 x 300
meters in size. A small concentration of primary debris, four pitted
stones and one sherd in a 1/4 acre area is the fourth site on this
drainage.
The range in activity-sets at each of these sites suggests permanent village sites with associated activity-specific areas between
dwellings or at the village borders. Differences in scale between
these sites parallel differences in soil fertility. The County Line
Creek tributary cluster, with only one base settlement, is associated
with a soil of less fertility than the two clusters with three or four
base settlements. The latter clusters, on Saline Creek and Chimney
Creek, are the only sites associated with red fine sandy loams, the
most fertile soils of the uplands.

STONE TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS
Stone technology is considered here as a preliminary reconstruction of the activities involved in the manufacture and use of
stone tools. This provides some evidence for relating sites to
economic activities, stages of manufacture, and environmental
associations. The aims of analysis are the determination of steps of
manufacture, quarry locations, and evidences of use.

UPPER NECHES

165

DEBRIS AND TOOL MANUFACTURE
Chipped stone elements and tools represent steps of tool production, modification or repair. These elements are:
1. Cores: nodules with one or more flakes struck off.
2. Primary cortex flakes: percussion flakes retaining the striking
platform with cortex covering the dorsal surface.
3. Secondary cortex flakes: percussion flakes with cortex partly
missing from the dorsal surface.
4. Interior flakes: percussion flake lacking cortex.
5. Flake tools: retouched flakes and scrapers (Fig. 5,a,d,e).
Retouched flakes are of gray flint, 3.1-3.6 cms. long. Scrapers
are tan or gray secondary or interior flakes (2.2-3.0 cms. x 1.22.1 cms. x .4-.8 cms) with abrupt retouch on the distal end,
lateral edge or both. Two specimens have visible wear on the
retouched surface. One large flake of gray silicified wood has
a notch 3 cm. wide and 7 cm. deep removed from one edge. It
was collected at X41 AN 2.
6. Small projectile points ("arrowpointsâ), which contrast in size
to larger "dart" points and include Perdiz and Catahoula
types. These are made of small flakes of flint or fine-grain
quartzite (Fig. 5,f).
7. Lipped flakes: soft hammer flakes with a faceted lipped platform. Cortex is minimal or missing. This category includes
"biface thinning flakes".
8. Biface fragments: edges or mid-sections of bifacially worked
tools, presumably snapped off during manufacture.
9. Biface blanks: bifacially percussion flaked foliate bifaces
without a stem or pressure flake scars. Some have knots or
cortex remnants.
10. Discarded points: incomplete projectile points or point
fragments that are assumed to have been discarded before
use. This includes points with irregularities or "knots" and in~
completely thinned or unfinished tools ("preformsâ) with the
stem or base formed to a pattern resembling completed points
(Fig. 5,g,i). Most of these can be related to one or two standard
morphological types.
11. Point fragments: fragments of thinned bifaces that are
recognizable as parts of completed or nearly-completed
projectile points. This category includes stems, bodies, or tips.
Stems and points with broken tips are tabulated separately
from whole points and body fragments, to test for differences
in distribution which indicate that broken points were

replaced at specific locations or site situations in the reservoir
area.
12. Cortex chips: small spells or shatter fragments lacking the
striking platform. Cortex is present on the dorsal surface.
These could have occurred as shatter from any step in percussion flaking while cortex remained on the parent rock.
13. Interior chip: small spells or shatter fragments lacking the
striking platform and having no cortex.
14. Dart points: large stemmed projectile points (Fig. 5,j,k). Types
collected in descending order of frequency are: Gary, Bulverde,
Yarbrough, Edgewood, Morrill, Dad, Ellis, Wells, and Trinity. The
distribution of lithic tools and debris is shown in Table 4.

SOURCE MATERIALS
Distribution of tools suggests that quarrying and tool production
were accomplished during the Caddoan period of occupation within
a more restricted area than during the Archaic period. One type of
stone, gray flint, appears to be non-local in origin and it is suggested
that this was used primarily in the Archaic period of occupation of
the reservoir, which suggests a larger sphere of economic activity
than during the Caddoan period.
Artifacts are of two general categories of stone: (1) course-grained
rock with irregular fracture (ferruginous sandstone, course quartzite) which can be ground or pecked to produce numerous forms
and surfaces, and (2) cryptocrystallines having conchoidal fracture
capable of producing edged tools (flint, fine-grained quartzite,
silicified wood). Coarse quartzite is found in Pleistocene gravels
along the west border of the river; this material occurs in the form
of hammerstones and manos. Sandstone outcrops are most
frequently seen in the ferruginous beds of the eastern uplands,
although some ledges are exposed by erosion on the western borders. Tools of this material include pitted stones, manos, grinding
platforms and anvils.
Several types of stone have conchoidal fracture and occur in
varying frequency in tools and in resource localities in the upper
Neches environment. Spotty gray to black flint occurs in the form of
dart points, bifaces, retouched flakes and chipping debris which
does not include cortex-backed flakes or cores. This is among the
finest-grain lithic material and occurs in the largest flakes and chipped stone tools. A few interior flakes and flake tools exceed 5 cms.
in length.

176

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Gray-tan to tan flint, also fine-grained, occures in all stages of
chipping debris and tool forms; a few cores of this material have
been found in site collections. Fine-grained quartzite varies in
quality of fracture; fine-grained flakes permit flaking of thin, small
points; coarser-grained quartzite is found in less symmetrical or
larger tools. Banded red, yellow, and brown petrified wood tends to
fracture along a plane and appears in few finished projectile points.
Gray granular silicified wood, which fractures in a coarse conchoidal pattern, occurs in large cores, bifaces, and unifaces.
Table 5 shows the distribution of all debris and tools by material
on both sides of the river. Although tan flint is clearly the
predominant material on both sides of the river, there is a larger
percentage of quartzite and gray flint elements on the west side of
the river.
It is suggested that these differences reflect quarrying from
several localities. Quartzite, banded silicified wood, and some tan
flint occur in the Pleistocene terrace gravels on low slopes east of
the river. No sources of gray, blue-gray, or spotted flint have been
found locally, so it may be non-local in origin, possibly from
limestones or gravels in central Texas (R. K. Harris, personal communication). Raw material at sites is limited to pebbles and small
cobbles of quartzite, flint pebbles 4 to 10 cms. in diameter, and a
few heavy quartzite and gray silicified wood cores. The significance
of these differences in distribution in terms of quarrying and tool
manufacture are indicated in Tables 6 to 9 which show specific
steps in tool manufacture for different materials.
From differences in frequency of occurrence of different steps of
manufacture in specific materials, several patterns in lithic resource
utilization are suggested. Cores and initial cortex flakes of gray flint
are absent from all sites, which supports the identification of this
material as non-local.
Tan flint is predominant on both sides of the river. However,
comparison of steps of production occurring at eastern and western
sites in Tables 7 and 8 shows a significantly higher proportion of
early-stage flakes (cortex and secondary) on the eastern side of the
river, suggesting that the source of this material may lie east of the
river.
Quartzite cores are markedly more frequent on the west side of
the river, evidence of quarrying at Pleistocene gravels, and indicate
that cobbles were carried to sites where stoneworking was begun.
Silicified wood debris occurs in very small numbers and does not
include lipped flakes. This is probably due to the refractory quality

of this material which flakes irregularly and appears in very crude
projectile points and preforms.
That gray flint was used more frequently during the Archaic occupation than in later periods is suggested by the debris and tools.
Table 10 shows the material from hunting stations with Archaic
components. Site X41 HE 11 is a lithic site with Archaic points
predominant; X41 AN 2 and X41 HE 17 are predominantly lithic,
with Archaic projectile points and few sherds.
Together, these three sites total over 15% of the chipped stone
elements collected from all 98 sites. This disproportionate amount
can be attributed to two factors: (1) they are sites with extensive occupation debris, and (2) they were exposed by land clearing and
construction. In spite of the fact that all percentages are thus
exaggerated, the proportion of gray flint, quartzite, and silicified
wood debris exceeds normal expectations and indicates that the
local Pleistocene terraces and distant gray flint sources were
primary origins of lithic material which was worked at Archaic
sites.

That gray flint was not utilized for tools in the Caddoan period is
suggested in Table 11; there are no arrowpoints of this material. Furthermore, there is a contrast between east and west in materials
predominant in arrowpoints, which parallels the difference shown
in manufacturing stages in Tables 6-8. Only quartzite arrowpoints
appear on the west side of the river; tan flint arrowpoints
predominate on the east side.

It is suggested from these distributional differences that the Caddoan period of occupation was marked by a decreased geographical
range of stone resource utilization in contrast to that of the Archaic
population.

PROJECTILE POINT MORPHOLOGY
The dart point forms found at Lake Palestine sites (Table 12) fall
within the range of types associated with Middle or Transitional Archaic periods, with an age range of 2000 B.C. to A.D. 1000 (Bell 1958,
1960; Suhm and Jelks 1962).

TOOLS OF GRANULAR STONE
The following artifacts are described and grouped by categories
reflecting tool form and the Process by which it was modified. Hammerstones and anvils are assumed to have been used in crushing
and hammering. Pitted stones may have been used for holding nuts
to be crushed and are similar to objects from southeastern sites
which are occasionally referred to as "nutting stones". Manos, grinding slabs, and grinding basins all show abrasive wear possibly
from grinding vegetable foods.
Hammerstones and Anvils
These tools show crushed and pecked surfaces; hammerstones
(Fig. 6a) are end-battered cobbles or cores, 5.0-10.0 cms. long and
4.0-6.0 cms. wide. Sandstone or quartzite platforms with pecked surfaces or pockmarked depressions are termed "anvils", since the
wear pattern appears to be the result of direct hammering (Fig. 6b).
Most anvils are fragments of ferruginous sandstone, unmodified except for hammering on one surface. They are 13 to 19 cms. long, 10
to 17 cms. wide, and 4.5 to 8 cms. thick. One specimen is a broken,
waterworn quartzite cobble, 8.5 cms. long, 8.5 cms. wide and 4.5
cms. thick.
Pitted Stones
Small concave pits, averaging 4.5 cms. deep and 2.8 cms. wide are
found in one or both faces of tabular pieces of ferruginous sandstone. The most common (Class A) is a pecked concavity in an
otherwise unworked slab of sandstone, 6.5-18.0 x 5.5-14.5 x 2.5-8.0
cms. (Fig. 6c). Others (Class B) have one or both faces surrounding
the pit worn smooth, though not necessarily flat; dimension range of
these is 8.5-11.5 x 4.5-8.5 x 2.5-5.5 cms. (Fig. 6d). Pits in the unmodified slabs are deeper than in those with smooth surfaces, and
in the smoothed stones the pits are also usually smoothed. None was
observed to have pecking that indicated that they were platforms for
bipolar flaking.
Pits also occur in the center of basins, 8.0-17.0 cms. wide and .6 to
1.7 cms. deep, in sandstone slabs; both basin and pit are unsmoothed (Fig. 6e).
By ethnographic example, these tools are tentati~âely interpreted
as "nut stones". Various observers of southeastern tribes observed
stones being used for crushing nuts, and these are the only objects
analogous to pitted stones. Two stones were used in crushing nuts;
references do not describe them explicitly but refer to them as large

and heavy. One observer states that a round stone was used to crush
nuts in a "thick and hollowed" stone (Swanton 1946: 364-366). Consequently, hammerstones, manos, and some of the concavely
ground basins described below, particularly those with pitted centers, may have been also used for tools in crushing nuts.
Ground Platforms and Basins
Some ferruginous sandstone slabs and basins have surfaces worn
from grinding. Platforms are irregularly shaped tablets up to 6.5
cms. thick with evenly ground surfaces of 12 cms. to 18 cms. and a
maximum depth of 1.7 cms. (Fig. 6h). Basins have circular concave
ground surfaces (Fig. 6i). These objects may include some of the
"thick and hollowed" stones used in grinding nuts.
Manos and Grinding Platforms
Small bifacially ground tablets, "manos", are usually made of
ferruginous sandstone (Fig. 6f); four are quartzite cobbles. These are
likely to have been used for grinding wild plant foods rather than
corn. Ethnohistoric accounts describe wooden mortars for
pulverizing grain (Swanton 1942: 131) but give no references to
hand-held grinding stones. Grinding surfaces on one or both faces
are flat to slightly laterally convex, indicating reciprocal motion. A
few have rounded surfaces and were probably used in rotary
grinding. Outline is variable and most are not carefully finished or
formed; they range from rectanguloid to ovoid. Length is 7.0 to 11.5
cms., width ranges from 5.0 to 8.5 cms., and thickness varies from
2.5 to 5.0 cms. Frequently manos have a small pit in one or both
grinding surfaces or in the unworked face (Fig. 6g). Pits in the
ground faces of pitted manos are shallow, narrower, and less
variable in size than those in pitted slabs, indicating that pits were
reduced with grinding.
Sandstone Fragments
Occasionally unmodified tabular sandstone fragments occur at
Caddoan settlements. These are 3.0 to 4.4 cms. thick and possibly
are fragments of grinding platforms, pitted stones, or spalls from the
manufacture of these tools.
Gouges
These two specimens ("Clear Fork Gouges") are bifacially
worked from ferruginous sandstone tablets, assymetrically lenticular in cross section with a tapering round base. The blunt distal

184

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

end is steeply flaked. Some cortex is retained on the flat dorsal surface and one specimen is obviously smoothed from wear on this
surface, from the abruptly retouched end to the middle of the tool.
Dimensions are: 6.0-6.7 x 4.7-5.1 x 1.9-2.2 cms.
Celt Fragment
One end of a ground stone tool, probably a celt, occurred at X41
CE 7. This is a smoothed rod of conglomerate (7.7 x 3.3-3.7 cms.)
which is oval in cross section.

POTTERY
Pottery listed in Table 4 is included as evidence of cooking or
storage vessels which provide an index of these domestic activities
at each site. The purpose of this .section is to consider attributes appropriate for determining stylistic microtraditions and to suggest the
approximate range of time represented by ceramic sites.
The pottery types and categories of decoration listed in Table 13
occur throughout the upper Neches, indicating widespread exchange in decorative styles. Frankston Focus types (Poynor
Engraved, Maydelle Incised, Bullard Brushed) are predominant. Basic
technological features are also similar throughout the reservoir. Few
sherds are highly polished; 10 to 60% are brushed, and the remainder are smoothed to a matte finish. Decorative treatment is by
engraving, incising, punctating, pinching, or neckbanding. Paste and
core color ranges from gray to buff. Orange spots and fire-clouding
on the surface indicate poorly controlled firing. Jars with brushed
bodies and rims decorated while the clay was still plastic (Maydelle
Incised, Bullard Brushed) have smudged exteriors more commonly
than other types, suggesting that these were used for cooking.
Of approximately 4,800 sherds, 215 have bone temper and 23 have
shell temper; the rest, about 95%, are grog-tempered. Bonetempering occurs in 35 out of 98 sites but is present in no more than
10% of sherds from any site. These are distributed over the entire
reservoir area and do not correlate with any settlement type or environment. A few bone-tempered sherds have incised designs
which indicate that the forms Canton Incised, Kiam Incised may be
restricted to bowls and jars. The majority are plain body sherds
which cannot be associated with specific vessel forms or use.
One technological feature, shell temper, shows a restricted
distribution. Shell tempering occurs in five sites, four of which (X41

UPPER NECHES

185

CE 1, X41 CE 17, X41 SM 10 and X41 SM 21) are located in the
eastern uplands. The fifth, X41 HE 33 is in the western uplands at
the northern end of the reservoir. Shell tempering is common in late
Caddoan sites on the Red River (Suhm, et al. 1954: 199-215) which
lies on the north and east of the Neches. There is a possibility that
this distribution represents contact with Red River Caddo although
these sherds lack decoration and cannot be identified with
decorative styles of that area.
Chronology
The establishment of a Caddoan archeological chronology in this
region has been based primarily on the basis of regional comparisons and derivation of horizon markers for periods which have
been assigned approximate dates (cf. Krieger 1946, Davis 1970). In
the Neches drainage, C-14 dates recently obtained at the George C.
Davis Site span the period of approximately A.D. 800 to A.D. 1150
(Dee Ann Story, paper presented at the 1970 Caddo Conference,
Magnolia, Arkansas). Probably the Alto Focus sites in the Lake
Palestine area date close to this period. At the historic level, types of
the Allen Focus (usually identified by the type Patton Engraved) are
dated from A.D. 1600 to A.D. 1800, by association with European
trade goods (Suhm, et al. 1954: 221). Stylistic continuity between the
pottery in these historic burials and Frankston Focus types (Poynor
and Hume Engraved) is fairly clear; a recent trial seriation of burial
vessels demonstrates close resemblances between the two (Shafer
1967). On the basis of these comparisons, it is suggested that Caddoan occupation in the Lake Palestine reservoir falls approximately
in the span from A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1600.
Ceramic Pipes
Most pipe fragments are from elbow pipes decorated by punctate
or engraved designs, similar to those at Jacksonâs "Perpetual Fire
Site" (Jackson 1936: Plate 28). Those at Alto Focus sites, X41 AN 16
and X41 AN 24, are undecorated pieces.
Ethnohistoric accounts do not tell who made pipes or the material
from which they were made. However, smoking in several ritual
contests is recorded. These included: (1) formal feasts at chiefâs
residences and dwellings of men with lesser status; (2) greeting
ceremonies, performed in a special "very large arbor" at which
peace was pledged by chiefs to missionaries; (3) feasts at the chiefâs
residence after a successful raid with display of scalps taken in battle suggesting validation of warrior status; (4) initiation of novice

shamans; and (5) smoking by elders, "captains", shamans and other
officials (unspecified) on the evening of the September harvest
ceremony, apparently at the chiefâs residence (Swanton 1942: 158227).
Social correlates of pipe smoking can be summarized as follows:
(1). pipes were smoked by adult males; (2) smoking was part of a
validating ritual signifying acquisition or perpetuation of status -chief, religious practitioner, or warrior; (3) the practice was part of
commensality and ritual effecting a bond between villages, tribes,
or European representatives; (4) smoking took place in the presence
of congregations of varying sizes but within a permanent village
with established ritual localities; and (5) associated feasts required
a relatively large supply of available food.
From this we should expect pipes to occur in permanent village
sites or ceremonial locations in association with village sites at
which permanent continuous residence is indicated by a concentration and variety of activities.

CONCLUSIONS AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
The data gathered in this survey have been used to isolate patterns of settlement and relate these patterns to the environment of
the upper Neches River. While new data have been gathered during
the survey, and distribution of sites tends to support some interpretations of prehistoric settlement systems, this report is intended to serve as a foundation for further research.
The purpose of excavation will be to test a series of hypotheses
concerning settlement in the upper Neches which have been implicitly or explicity posed in the survey report.
1. In the earliest period of occupation of the upper Neches it was
visited intermittently by small hunting parties whose total exploitive territory is not included in the reservoir. Two sites with Archaic components have been selected for excavation to further
define the activities of these early occupations. It is expected that
midden deposits will be lacking as will concentrated and localized
deposits indicating camp floors. Tools other than those associated
with hunting and tool manufacture will be absent or minimal. Nonlocal flint is expected to appear in greater frequency in the Archaic
components than in Caddoan components and sites.
2. Caddoan occupation of the upper Neches represents a shift in
settlement to small economically self-sufficient swidden villages
whose extent of social interaction was markedly more limited than

UPPER NECHES

193

that of early Caddo nuclear centers.
Earliest Caddoan occupation of the upper Neches consists of
small widely-scattered sites, possibly economically independent,
but probably with social ties to distant settlements. Settlements to
which the small Alto Focus cluster may have been related include
settlements across the river with which the multiple burials are
presumed to have been associated: a mound site on Caddo Creek, 6
miles south; the Pace McDonald Site, 25 miles south; or the George
C. Davis Site, 50 miles south. The first objective of salvage excavation is to determine if Alto Focus sites in the reservoir
represent permanent or seasonal occupation.
3. Excavated Frankston Focus sites are expected to provide
evidence for assigning sites to one of the elements of the settlement
system abstracted from Hasinai data. Sites selected include base settlements, camps or settlements and hunting/gathering stations.
Ethnographic equ!valents are hamlets, fishing camps or hunting
camps. Strategy for excavation and analysis of these sites is to be
based on the contrasting models summarized belowâ:

cheologically, a corresponding community of related and
cooperating females can be determined as micro-traditions in pottery decoration. This does not require that strict matrilocality is
assumed, only that a stable and cooperating task group of related
females is characteristic of the base settlement.
Recent work in the Midwest (Deetz 1965) and the Southwest
(Longacre 1970) has pioneered the use of ceramic attributes as a
means of identifying matrilocal segments of a single community.
Although Caddoan villages present a different type of community
structure, a similar approach is applicable in the study of settlement
change in the upper Neches. Such ceramic studies should help
clarify the change in community structure accompanying the Gibson-Fulton transition.
Woodall (1969) has recently designated two prehistoric tribes in
the upper Neches on the basis of ceramic similarities between sites
in two areas of the river valley. The division between these two
tribes lies a short distance north of Saline Creek. Pottery collected
during survey has not been analyzed by attributes which permit
evaluation of Woodallâs model, and relatively few sites have been
located in the area of his northern tribe. "Attribute analysis for excavated sites is proposed for a test of the hypothesis that underlies
Woodallâs work -- that social distance correlates with geographical
distance as an expression of community autonomy among the
prehistoric Caddo.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This is the initial report of archeological investigations at Lake Palestine, conducted
by Southern Methodist Universlty to salvage sites threatened by enlargement of the
reservoir from 317 feet msl. to 345 feet msl. The research has been supported by Contract 14-10-7:931-37 between Southern Methodist University and the National Park
Service.
As in any archeological report, this is the product of cooperation and work of a
number of people who deserve as much credit as the author. The 1969 seasonâs work
in Lake Palestine was directed by S. Alan Skinner, research archeologist at Southern
Methodist University. Alan and his assistant, James Baker, directed most of the survey
and test excavation. During the 1970 season, the author was assisted in additional survey by E. Pierre Morenon, graduate student in anthropology at Southern Methodist
University.
The amount of work that was accomplished could not have been done without the
willingness and enthusiasm of the crew. I particularly want to thank George Cooper,
Ricky Clements, Eddy Kelly, Bruce Walker, Terry Thedford and Cecil Tate. Special
credit is due Glenn Garner. His energy and interest made him an invaluable excavation hand, laboratory assistant and informant on local ecology.

The author had the benefit of the knowledge of several local specialists on the Lake
Palestine environment. Soil Conservation Service District Conservationists Floyd Sanders (Tyler) and B. L. McClaophlin (Athens) were especially helpful in providing information about local soils. Tom Browning and Robert Sinclair of the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department were similarly generous in sharing their knowledge of local
fauna.
The organization and content of this report benefited from the methodological
suggestions and editing by ]ames V. Sciscenti, Director, River Basin Salvage Program
at Southern Methodist University and Principal Investigator of the Lake Palestine contract. Illustrations were drawn by Nancy Sciscenti. Rex L. Wilson, Chief of Archeological Research at the Southwest Archeological Cenler, has helped continuously
in planning and expeditin8 the project.
Finally, I am grateful to the residents of the Lake Palestine area for help in many
ways. Red McFarland provided useful information on amateur excavations. Particular
thanks are due to Mr. and Mrs. D. ]. Clements for their hospitality and generous help.
