Management Summary
On April 18, 2017, an intensive survey was completed in order to inventory and evaluate
archeological resources within the footprint of an approximately 0.7-mile long Atmos natural gas
pipeline route in Bryan, Brazos County, Texas. The alignment begins at a newly constructed Atmos
facility south of State Highway 47, crosses the roadway to the north, then turns east following the
TxDOT right-of-way on the north side of SH 47, crosses Health Services Center Parkway, then
parallels the east side of Health Center Services Parkway to its northern terminus immediately past
Bio-Medical Way. The proposed area of potential affects (APE) is a 25-foot wide easement for a
buried, 6-inch, high-density poly pipe for a majority of the route with a 10-inch casing crossing SH
47 for a total of 2.4 acres. The project is expected to be installed via boring as it crosses SH 47
and via open-cut trenching for the remaining portions of the alignment.
A portion of the pipeline falls within the utility easement adjacent to State Highway 47, which is
owned by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), an agency of the State of Texas. As
such, the project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas and fieldwork was conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit 7981 by Chris Dayton of Cox|McLain Environmental Consulting, Inc.
The entire proposed corridor was subjected to pedestrian inspection, with particular focus given to
areas that exhibited minimal disturbance and a higher potential for intact surface and subsurface
cultural material. Ground surface visibility at the time of survey was generally less than 20 percent
due to maintained grass or mixed tall grasses and forbs. The majority of the project area has been
severely impacted by previous roadway construction, roadway maintenance and utility installations
(gas, water) that follow and/or cross the APE.
In all, seven shovel tests were excavated within the APE. Typical shovel tests revealed gravelly clay
over dry, compact sandy loam deposits to a depth of 60 centimeters below surface. Shovel tests
were only excavated in areas where previous impacts were not apparent, ground visibility was less
than 30 percent, and where there was a likely presence of intact soils that could contain
archeological deposits.
No new archeological sites were identified and no artifacts were collected; therefore, only project
records will need to be curated. Project records will be permanently housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas in Austin.
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with the findings and recommendations of this
report on May 8, 2107.

INTRODUCTION

Overview of the Project
Atmos Energy proposes to replace a segment of natural gas pipeline in the southwestern portion of
Bryan, Texas in Brazos County (Figure 1). The purpose of this report is to summarize the results of
archeological investigations conducted within the approximately 0.7-mile long proposed gas
pipeline replacement route. The pipeline route begins at a newly constructed Atmos facility south
of State Highway 47, crosses the roadway to the north, then turns east following the TxDOT rightof-way on the north side of SH 47, crosses Health Services Center Parkway, then parallels the east
side of Health Center Services Parkway to its northern terminus immediately past Bio-Medical Way
(Figure 2a-2b). The proposed area of potential affects (APE) is a 25-foot wide easement for a
buried, 6-inch, high-density poly pipe for a majority of the route with a 10-inch casing crossing SH
47 for a total of 2.4 acres. The project is expected to be installed via boring as it crosses SH 47
and via open-cut trenching for the remaining portions of the alignment.
Chris Dayton of Cox|McLain Environmental Consulting, Inc. (CMEC) performed the fieldwork on
April 18, 2017. Placement of the shovel test units within the APE was based on observed disturbance
levels, ground surface visibility, the professional judgment of the archeologist in the field, and
guidelines established by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and approved by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC). The methods employed during this study and relevant constraints are
discussed further in Chapters 3 and 4.

Regulatory Context
The project falls within a utility easement associated with the SH 47 right-of-way, which belongs to
the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), an agency of the State of Texas. Therefore, the
project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (9 TNRC 191). Antiquities Permit 7981 was
assigned to this project by the THC. A field survey was completed in order to inventory and evaluate
archeological resources within the project APE. No new archeological sites were identified and no
artifacts were collected. All other materials (notes, photographs, administrative documents, and
other project data) generated from this work will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas, where they will be made permanently available to
future researchers.

Structure of the Report
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 presents environmental parameters, a brief cultural context,
and a summary of previous archeological research near the APE. Chapter 3 discusses research
goals, relevant methods, and the underlying regulatory considerations. Chapter 4 presents the
results of the survey and summarizes the implications of the investigations, and references are in
Chapter 6.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT

Topography, Geology, and Soils
The project APE is located at elevations between approximately 320 and 340 feet above mean
sea level in west-central Brazos County, Texas. Geologically, the APE is primarily underlain by
Quaternary (Pleistocene) high gravel deposits extending up to 25 feet deep (U.S. Geological
Survey [USGS] 2017). According to Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) data, the soils
fall under the Tabor-Robco-Chazos Series with loamy fine sands underlain by clay loam, or clay.
The sandy A horizon extends to 15 centimeters (6 inches) in the Tabor and Chazos Series and to 38
centimeters (15 inches) in the Robco Series. A loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam E horizon
underlies the A horizon, extending to 36 and 38 centimeters (14 and 15 inches) in the Tabor and
Chazos Series, respectively, and to 71 centimeters (28 inches) in the Robco Series. Clay loam, sandy
clay loam, and clays in the underlying B horizons reach a depth of 165 to 203 centimeters (65 to
80 inches) (NRCS 2017).

Vegetation, Physiography, and Land Use
Brazos County falls in the Southern Post Oak Savanna ecoregion of Texas, which is characterized
as a mix of post oak woods, improved pasture, and rangeland with a small percentage of invasive
mesquite (Griffith et al. 2007). The project area is located primarily on developed land adjacent
to SH 47 and Health Science Center Parkway within the Texas A&M University campus.

Archeological Chronology for Southeast Texas
The APE lies within the Southeast Texas archeological region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993;
Patterson 1995; Perttula 2004; Story et al. 1990), which has a cultural history extending back at
least 12,000 years into the past. Human occupation of the area during these 12,000 years is
divided into four broad periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The periods
are based on a proposed sequence of economic strategies identified in the archeological and
historical records. These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways consider cultural, economic, and
technological factors in order to provide a model useful for attempting to understand ancient and
early historic populations. The dates assigned to the period interfaces represent a generalized time
range but are based on scientific results from archeological research. The dates presented in Table
1 are derived from Perttula (2004).
Further discussion of the prehistory of Southeast Texas is beyond the scope of this document. For
such a discussion regarding the prehistoric record, the reader is referred to Aten (1983), Ensor
(1991), Patterson (1995), Shafer et al. (1975), and Story et al. (1990), among others.

Historic Context
The earliest known European exploration of the region dates to the early sixteenth century with
Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vacaâs travels up the San Jacinto River from Galveston Island around
1529 to trade with the woodland Indians. Spanish soldiers under the command of Coahuilaâs
governor, Alonso De LeÃ³n, passed through the region in 1689, followed by JoaquÃ­n de Orobio y
Basterra in 1727 (Kleiner 2016). The Spanish continued to expand their occupation in Texas and
reported Bidai and Tonkawa Indians in the area, and there is evidence that groups related to the
Apaches and Comanches occasionally hunted buffalo far east as Brazos County. Spanish travelers
on the Old San Antonio Road passed along the northwest boundary of the future county, but there
was no Spanish settlement in the area (Odintz 2016a).
Brazos County was included in Stephen F. Austinâs second colony and became part of Washington
Municipality under the Mexican government. In 1837 most of the area was included in Washington
County, however the Brazos River, which bisected Washington County, proved to be a serious
obstacle to county government, and a new county, Navasota, was formed in January 1841 with the
county seat at Boonville. In January 1842 Navasota County was renamed Brazos County (Odintz
2016a).
The area around the future site of Bryan was settled by members of Stephen F. Austinâs colony in
the 1820s and 1830s. In 1859, when the Houston and Texas Central Railroad graded a railroad
bed through the area. William Joel Bryan, a nephew of Austinâs, donated land to the railroad
company for a townsite (Bryan). Construction of the railroad was halted at Millican, eighteen miles
southeast of Bryan, during the Civil War but a community of some 300 inhabitants grew up at the
6

townsite. A post office was opened in 1866, and that same year the county voted for Bryan to
replace Boonville as the county seat (Odintz 2016b).

Previous Investigations and Previously Identified Resources
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) maintained by the THC and TARL was
conducted in order to identify archeological sites, historical markers (Recorded Texas Historic
Landmarks or RTHLs), properties or districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP),
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), cemeteries, or other cultural resources that may have been
previously recorded in or near the APE, as well as previous surveys undertaken in the area. A 1mile buffer area around the APE was also examined (see Figure 2a-2b).
According to the Atlas survey coverage data search, no cultural resources or archeological sites
have been recorded in the APE. A large cultural resources project within the 1-mile study area
intersects the APE and was conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates in 2007 for the Texas
A&M Health Sciences Center (Moore and Baxter 2007, THC 2017). Site 41BZ164, a lithic scatter
located west of the current APE, was recorded during the survey. A historic farmstead, site 41BZ89,
located approximately 0.91 kilometers west of the APE was recorded in 1987 north of the current
location of SH 47. The site consisted of a single-story house on limestone piers and a barn. Artifacts
associated with the site included corrugated steel roofing material, plain white earthenware, and
glass. Four sites (41BZ132, 41BZ133, 41BZ134, and 41BZ135) of unknown prehistoric age were
recorded during a survey conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates for the City of Bryan in
1999 and 2000; two of the sites were determined ineligible and two were determined to have an
undetermined eligibility. Located in very close proximity to the APE (approximately 0.05 kilometers
south of the APE), site 41BZ166 was recorded in 2010 by Jason Barrett with TxDOT. The site was
discovered during a survey for grade separation on SH 47 and contained a lithic scatter with six
pieces of lithic debris of which two flakes were found in a shovel test in the median of the highway.
Further investigations were not recommended and the site was not eligible for entry into the
National Register or as a SAL (THC 2017).
A review of available historic aerial photographs and topographic maps on Google Earthâ¢ and
the Nationwide Environmental Title Research (NETR) website, www.historicaerials.com, was also
undertaken to determine how the corridor had been utilized over time. The earliest aerial available,
produced in 1960, revealed that the area was mostly undeveloped at the time with subsequent
aerial photographs from 1961 and 1971 showing that the area had not changed. By 1995
construction of SH 47 started, and shows in the 2004 and 2008 aerial photographs as completed.
In the 2010 and 2012 aerial photographs, the Texas A&M Health Science Center complex is
present, but the road the APE parallels north of SH 47, Health Science Center Parkway, was not
yet built (NETR 2017). The earliest topographic map available dates to 1956 and shows the area
to be undeveloped land with no structures mapped in or near the APE. The same undeveloped land
remains the same in the 1964 and 1972 topographic maps. The 1973, 1980, and 1984
topographic maps show the area still undeveloped with a cluster of two to three structures east of
the APE north of the current location of SH 47 (NETR 2017).

RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

Purpose of the Research
The present study was carried out to accomplish three major goals:
1. To identify all historic and prehistoric archeological resources located within the APE defined
in Chapter One;
2. To perform a preliminary evaluation of the identified resourcesâ potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and/or for designation as a SAL (typically performed concurrently); and
3. To make recommendations about the need for further research concerning the identified
resources based on the preliminary NRHP/SAL evaluation, with guidance on methodology
and ethics from the THC and CTA.

Antiquities Code of Texas
The Antiquities Code of Texas (9 TNRC 191) requires consideration of effects on properties
designated asâor eligible to be designated asâSALs. SALs are defined as:
. . . sites, objects, buildings, structures and historic shipwrecks, and locations of historical,
archeological, educational, or scientific interest including, but not limited to, prehistoric
American Indian or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, aboriginal
paintings, petroglyphs, and other marks or carvings on rock or elsewhere which pertain to
early American Indian or other archeological sites of every character, treasure imbedded
in the earth, sunken or abandoned ships and wrecks of the sea or any part of their contents,
maps, records, documents, books, artifacts, and implements of culture in any way related to
the inhabitants, prehistory, history, government, or culture in, on, or under any of the lands
of the State of Texas, including the tidelands, submerged land, and the bed of the sea
within the jurisdiction of the State of Texas.
Rules of practice and procedure for the evaluation of cultural resources as SALs, which is also
explicitly referenced at the state level, are detailed at 13 TAC 26. An archeological site identified
on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas may be of sufficient significance to allow
designation as a SAL if at least one of the following criteria applies:
1. the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. the site's archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
4. the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
8

5. the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to insure [sic] maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic
collecting when the site cannot be protected.
For archeological resources, the state-level process requires securing a valid Texas Antiquities
Permit from the THC, the lead state agency for Antiquities Code compliance. This permit must be
maintained throughout all stages of investigation, analysis, and reporting.

Survey Methods and Protocols
With the goals and guidelines above in mind, CMEC personnel conducted an intensive survey on
April 18, 2017. Field methods and strategies will comply with the requirements of Texas Antiquities
Code, as elaborated by the THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).
Shovel tests were placed judgmentally in areas where soils appeared to be of sufficient depth to
contain subsurface cultural materials, and/or previous disturbance appeared minimal.
All shovel tests were excavated in natural levels to subsoil or depths of 60 centimeters (cm) (23.6
inch [in]), whichever was encountered first. Excavated matrix was screened through 0.635-cm or
0.25-in hardware cloth as allowed by moisture and clay content; a high clay content typically
requires that the excavated sediment be crumbled/sorted by hand, trowel, and/or shovel point.
Deposits were described using conventional texture classifications and Munsell color designations,
and all observations were recorded on standard CMEC shovel test forms. The shovel testing protocol
detailed in the approved scope for permit 7981 called for shovel tests to be placed at 5-m (16ft) intervals in each cardinal direction around each shovel test containing cultural material until two
negative units have been established in each cardinal direction, as allowed by project limits,
observed disturbance, and other constraints. Deviations from THC and CTA standards were
explicitly justified.
The majority of the APE is located on publicly-owned land where only temporally diagnostic
materials would be collected if encountered. In the segments on privately owned land, any artifacts
found from shovel tests and/or surface contexts would have been noted, described, photographed,
and returned to their original contexts. However, all shovel tests excavated for this project were
negative for cultural material.
All materials (notes, photographs, administrative documents, and other project data) generated
from this work will be curated at TARL where they will be made permanently available to future
researchers.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

General Field Observations and Results
On April 16, 2017, CMEC personnel conducted an intensive archeological survey of the entire 0.7mile long gas pipeline replacement route. The intensive survey included both pedestrian inspection
and shovel testing. Ground surface visibility within the APE was generally low (less than 20 percent)
due to maintained grass or mixed tall grasses and forbs along the roadside. Overall, the project
area has been severely impacted by previous roadway construction, roadway maintenance and
utility installations (gas, water) that follow and/or cross the APE.
Beginning at the southwestern project terminus, disturbance related to construction of a new Atmos
facility is evident, as the area is devoid of vegetation and non-local fill dirt covers much of the
surface surrounding the recent construction area (Figure 3). The APE crossing SH 47 is completely
occupied by paved or extensively modified surfaces including grading along the frontage roads
and elevated main lanes. The APE along the north side of SH 47 is an approximately 30 percent
grade, sloping up to the north, covered in tall grasses and forbs (Figure 4). The eastern portion of
the SH 47 ROW within the APE slopes down to the north into a natural drainage (see Figure 1). The
area along Health Services Center Parkway is minimally disturbed and consists of both tall and
short, maintained grasses (Figure 5). As this area appeared to be relatively intact, seven shovel
tests were excavated (Table 2). However, soils in four of the shovel tests indicate utility fill. The
remaining units contained clay with gravel over sandy loam or sandy loam. No artifacts or features
were observed in any of the shovel tests. At the time of survey, an open excavation trench was
present at the northern project terminus (Figure 6).

Recommendations
Results of the survey indicate that extensive disturbances within the APE due to previous roadway
construction and maintenance activities, utility installation, and university building driveways have
greatly affected the potential for identifying any intact archeological deposits. No evidence was
found of any preserved deposits with a high degree of integrity, associations with distinctive
architectural and material culture styles, rare materials and assemblages, the potential to yield
data important to the study of preservation techniques and the past in general, or potential
attractiveness to relic hunters. No additional archeological investigations are warranted prior to
construction activities. No artifacts were collected, therefore, only project records will need to be
curated. Project records will be curated at TARL where they will be made permanently available
to future researchers.
If any unanticipated cultural materials or deposits are found at any stage of clearing, preparation,
or construction, the work should cease in that area and THC personnel should be notified
immediately. Should additional coordination with THC be necessary due to inadvertent discovery,
construction would continue in areas not affected.
