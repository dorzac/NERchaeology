EXCAVATIONS AT THE COLLINS SITE,
TRAVIS COUNTY, TEXAS
DEEANNSUHM
INTRODUCTION
The Collins Site is situated on the south bank of Onion
Creek, approximately six miles south of Austin. It was
located early in the fall of 1953 by students from the Department of Anthropology, The University of Texas. Evidence of occupation was easily recognized in several deep
gullies eroded into the site, exposing artifacts, hearthstones,
flint chips and bone fragments. A test pit confirmed these
indications and made it apparent that controlled excavation
would produce useful data concerning aboriginal habitation
of the area.
Excavation of the Collins Site was undertaken as a student
project, under the supervision of students who had had
previous field experience. In order to fit academic schedules, digging was limited to Sundays, from October 1953 to
May 1954, with a crew of six to ten members. By such an
undertaking the students were able to obtain significant
archeological information and, at the same time, acquaint
themselves with archeological field techniques.
The writer would like to acknowledge the cooperation of
Walter Collins, the land owner, and A. Lawson Boothe,
owner of the adjacent property; to credit the enthusiasm
shown by all the students comprising the crew: Joan Ablon,
Nelda Cade, Dale Exley, Ann Pescor Leonard, Jerry Reeves,
William E. Stanton, Rudy Troike, Nancy Patterson Troike,
and Edwin Williams; and to thank the Department of Anthropology for providing equipment for excavation and laboratory facilities for analysis of the artifacts. The opportunity to examine and to photograph artifacts collected from
the site by William E. Stanton is also appreciated. Finally,
the encouragement and helpful advice so freely given by
Edward B. Jelks of the National Park Service, and T. N.
Campbell and Alex D. Krieger of The University of Texas,
Department of Anthropology, have done much to make this
report possible.

GEOLOGY AND NATURAL SETTING
The site is buried in the third terrace (second terrace
above the floodplain) of Onion Creek, about ten miles above
the confluence of the creek and the Colorado River. In that
vicinity the creek is deeply entrenched into a Cretaceous
limestone formation, exposing vertical bluffs on both sides
of the valley. The subsequent stream deposition and erosion
cycles are represented by the terraces.
The third terrace (T-3) is approximately 46 feet above
the present creek channel. It is about 200 feet across the
northern edge of T -3 to the base of the limestone bluff.
The second terrace (T-2) is considerably smaller, only 15
to 20 feet across, and is 16 to 18 feet above the creek bed.
Smallest and most recent of the terraces (T-1) is the very
narrow floodplain bordering the edge of Onion Creek; it is
only several feet above the stream.
The deep gullies cutting into the terraces have exposed a
cross-section of the valley fill. Resting on top of the limestone bedrock is a greenish material of igneous origin. Although a large portion of this deposit has eroded away, it
outcrops at various points along the banks of Onion Creek.
This material, loosely referred to as serpentine, is a volcanic ash composed largely of montmorillonite clay (Weiss
and Clabaugh, 1955, pp. 136-48) . It emanated from a series
of sea-floor eruptions which occurred during late Cretaceous
times (ibid., pp. 136-7). The hard basaltic core of one of
these volcanoes, located several miles southeast of the site,
is known as Pilot Knob.
After the eruption, the volcanic ash was buried by further
accumulations of limestone. Subsequent erosion by Onion
Creek has cut through the upper limestone deposit and
much of the igneous material. In places the stream is flowing across limestone underlying the volcanic debris.
A tightly consolidated gravel, several feet
lies above the igneous deposit. The remainder
fill consists of calcareous silts which can be
two strata. The uppermost stratum (II), 4

in thickness,
of the valley
divided into
to 5 feet in

Excavations at the Collins Site, Travis County, Texas

thickness, is a black, clay soil containing a great deal of
decayed organic matter. The lower constituent (Stratum I)
is of a very similar composition, but it is buff in color and
has very little humus. 1 Cultural material extended well into
Stratum I, but greatly decreased in frequency at about 6
feet below the surface. There was no clear demarcation
between these two strata.
The upland area was a rolling grassland less than a century ago and probably supported fairly large herds of grazing animals. Today mesquite, scrub oak and prickly pear
grow along the rim of the valley, while hackberry, oak,
cottonwood and cypress border the creek. No charred vegetable remains were recovered during excavation, though the
durable hackberry seed was found extending to a depth of
about 5 feet. Present-day fauna consists largely of small
mammals, particularly rabbit, armadillo, skunk, squirrel and
opossum. Other animals identified as historically present
include deer, bison, raccoon, fox, beaver and coyote. Deer
and bison were the most important of the animals hunted,
judging by the bone fragments recovered.
About 200 yards east of the site is a large spring which
has continued to flow in spite of low rainfall in recent
years. The abundance of water coupled with a food supply
which could readily have been obtained from game animals,
turtles, fresh-water mussels, fishes, and various wild plant
products must have been enticing features to aboriginal
groups. In addition, innumerable flint nodules can be found
in the stream bed and above the bluffs, and the shallow
rock shelters which occur in the limestone bluffs would
have afforded protection during bad weather. One of these
shelters, the Smith Site, about a quarter of a mile upstream
from the Collins Site was excavated by University of Texas
students in 1954-5 (Anonymous, 1954; Suhm, 1955).
1. Soil samples were analyzed by the Bureau of Economic Geology, The University of Texas.

METHOD OF CONTROL AND EXCAVATION
A grid system consisting of 5 foot squares was laid out
on approximately the central portion of the site (Fig. 1) .
Coordinates going north-south were designated by capital
letters (A, B, etc.), while those running east-west were
labeled by numbers (1, 2, etc.). Any 5 foot square excavated outside the grid was called a "test pit." The test
pits were differentiated by the use of capital letters, such
as Test Pit A, Test Pit B, etc. When test pits were adjacent
to one another they were designated with Roman numerals,
such as Test Pit C I, C II, etc.
A datum point 42 inches above the ground level was established on a small oak tree near the grid. Measurements
were taken from the projected datum plane to the point
where the datum stake (i. e., the stake from which the levels
were measured) intersected the ground surface. However,
since there was relatively little variation in the surface
contour, all depth measurements in the field notes and those
presented herein were made from the surface of the highest
corner of the square (the datum stake) .
Since it was not feasible to excavate the site in cultural
or geological zones, each square was dug by arbitrary 6
inch levels. All material was sifted through a quarter-inch
mesh screen and the artifacts and identifiable bone fragments collected from each 6 inch level were placed in a paper
bag and later catalogued. Snail shells, charred bone and
charcoal suitable for radiocarbon dating were also collected
from many levels.
A total of 30 squares was excavated; nine of these were
dug to a depth of 12 inches, four to 18 inches, seven to 24
inches, one to 30 inches, four to 36 inches, one to 42, 54, 60,
66 and 88 inches respectively. The areal extent of occupation, outlined in Figure 1, was approximately 480 feet long
and 99 feet wide. Only the central portion of this area
seemed to have been intensively occupied. The greatest
depth of occupation is not known as excavations did not
exceed 88 inches. So few artifacts were found in the three

lowest levels that it was deemed more practical to concentrate on the upper 5 feet. However, a careful examination of the deep gullies seemed to indicate that occupation
did not extend much beyond 8 or 9 feet.
Hearths consisting of fire-cracked limestone and charcoal
were very common. These fire areas occurred at all levels,
but were more frequent in depth below 12 inches. For the
most part, the hearthstones were scattered and there was no
consistent arrangement. Aside from the hearths no features
were recorded. Pits, postholes, etc., would have been very
difficult to detect because of the lack of variation in most
of the alluvium. No burials were found, but the proximal
end of a human femur occurred in Test Pit D. Careful
searching in that vicinity failed to uncover other human
bones.
ANALYSIS OF ARTIFACTS
Shortly after excavations had begun it was apparent that
two components were present at the site. The upper one
was represented by the Central Texas Aspect and was recognized primarily by small, thin arrow points and pottery.
The lower cultural member was the Edwards Plateau Aspect, identified by many dart point types and other lithic
implements. Unfortunately for analysis, the two were not
separated in the upper 18 inches of the site. In some cases,
it was difficult to associate artifacts with one or the other
aspect. However, arrow points and pottery did not extend
below a depth of 18 inches; this, combined with data from
other sites where the distinctions are clearer, forms the
basis for recognition of the two cultural units.
Pottery and projectile points were grouped according to
types presented in "An Introductory Handbook of Texas
Archeology" (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954). For definition of other classes of artifacts described below, see the
glossary in that volume.

finds made at the Collins Site. All sherds were from the
three upper 6 inch zones. Pottery consistently occurs in the
Central Texas Aspect, although usually in small quantities.
It is typically plain, varying considerably in color and, to
a much lesser extent, in t ex ture. The few decor ated sherds
reported (J ackson, 1938, pp. 108-112; Krieger 1946 p. 166;
Miller and Jelks, 1952, p. 185; Jelks, 1953, pp. 205-6) have
been identified as tr ade items from Caddoan gr oups in east
Texas.
Two hundred and thir ty-four sherds from the Collins Site
ar e classified as Leon Plain (Krieger, 1946, p . 166; Suhm ,
Krieger and J elks, 1954, pp . 286-8, P late 74, A -E). These
potter y fragm en ts r epresent an estimated th ree to five v essels; howev er all sherds are small and very little can be
determined of vessel shapes. Th e maj ority are thin, 2 to 4
mm. in thickness, hard and compact in texture, and tempered with finely pulv erized bone. Ten sh erds (Plate 2,
MM) are notably thicker, 6 to 10 mm., and somewhat coarser
in texture, but are included in Leon Plain . Interior surfaces
of all sherds are well-smoothed ; the exter ior surfaces are
polished, sometimes having a glossy fin ish. Sherds grade in
color from reddish , buff, gray-brown, to black; cores are
consistently dark. There are no indications of a red wash
or slip and all variations in color are attributable to firing
conditions. Two vessels have appendages consisting of a
loop handle (Plate 2, HH) and a small node (Plate 2, KK) .
Both appendages are just below the rim and presumably
there were two handles on the one vessel, while the other
had two or more nodes.
'
Decorated sherds number 615, representing at least eight
vessels. Two small sherds, probably from one vessel, have
incised designs (Plate 2, LL); otherwise they closely resemble Leon Plain. These fragments are so small that it is
difficult to determine the exact placement of the decoration.
Presumably most of the body was plain and undoubtedly
a portion of this vessel was tabulated with Leon Plain. Judging from what little was recovered, the design consists of
short, hachured lines, combined-perhaps enclosed-by a

16

Texas Archeological Society

horizontal line. The horizontal line below (?) the hachuring
indents to form a small square. Although based on extremely scanty data, the incising is reminiscent of designs on
coastal pottery (see Rockport Incised and Goose Greek Incised in Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, pp. 380, 385 and
Plate 72).
The majority of the potsherds, estimated to belong to
seven vessels, had brushed decoration, often combined with
rows of punctates made around some parts of the rim.
These vessels could not be identified as any established
type, but it is believed that they are distinctive enough to
designate as a provisional new type - Boothe Brushed
(Plates 1, A-I and 2, II, JJ). The following definition is
based entirely on pottery found at the Collins Site and is
expected to be modified as larger samples are studied. The
most complete vessel (Plate 1, G) differed from the others
in temper, absence of punctates and having more random
and deeper striations; however it is tentatively included
in this type.
PASTE
Method of manufacture: Probably coiled.
Temper: Pulverized bone; one vessel (Plate 1, G) has no
visible tempering agent.
Texture: Fine to fairly coarse, but in all instances hard
and does not crumble.
Color: Interior and exterior surfaces gray, grayish- buff,
almost black, and yellowish-red. Considerable mottling,
sometimes producing striking variation in color on a
single vessel. Cores uniformly gray.
Surface finish: Exterior covered with brushing, usually
combined with punctates; inside very well-smoothed,
rarely polished.
FORM
Wall thickness: 3 to 7 mm.; most are thin, 4 to 5 mm.
Lip: Straight and flat (Â·P late 2, II) ; one convex and
turned outward (Plate 2, JJ) .
Base: Only one definite base could be reconstructed, a
thick flat disk to which the wall was attached (Plate 1,
G) . The failure to recognize other basal sherds suggests

that some may have been gently convex and not much
thicker than the vessel walls. They may have been classified as body sherds.
Vessel shape and size: All appear to have been jars,
probably about 18 to 25 em. in height with oral diameter
14 to 18 em. High rims flare gently outward and meet
the body at a slight angle (Plate 1, A, C). Jars have no
clear demarcation between the rim and body (Plate 1,
G); their bodies usually bulge slightly below the rim or
toward the lower portion.
DECORATION
Treatment: Brushing, punctating and, less often, applique.
Design: Bodies covered with horizontal, vertical, or, less
frequently, random striations; usually they are neat and
closelv spaced (Plate 1, A, C). Rims are usually brushed
vertically or horizontally. All but one vessel (Plate 1,
G) combine punctates with brushing. At least three
have one to two rows of punctates at the juncture of
body and rim (Plate 1, A-C, E, I); several have a row of
punctates just below the rim (Plate 1, D, H). Punctates
appear to have been made with blunt tools. Occasionally vertical fillets appear on the vessel bodies, just below neck punctates (Plate 1, E, F); rarely there are
small nodes (number uncertain) just below the lip
(Plate 1, H).
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
At present known only as a minor type of the Central
Texas Aspect. Similarity in paste suggests that it is linked
with Leon Plain.
Brushed decoration sometimes combined with punctates
and applique is a common feature of Fulton Aspect
utility pottery in east Texas. Closest similarities are
with Bullard Brushed of the Frankston and Titus Foci
(Krieger, 1946; Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, pp. 2523, Plate 9), but Boothe Brushed differs considerably in
paste and somewhat in vessel shape, size, and mode of
brushing. It is not Caddoan trade ware and probably
was made at the Collins Site.
DISTRIBUTION
Definitely present only at Collins Site so far as known. A
vessel from Kincaid Site, Uvalde County, is similar to
the large jar in Plate 1, G (T. N. Campbell, personal
communication). Some brushed sherds from the Belton
Reservoir sites (Miller and Jelks, 1952, Tables 1 to 4)

20

were examined by the writer. A few resemble Boothe
Brushed but the majority are more like the brushed
Caddoan trade sherds foun d in Central Texas, like Bullard Brushed.

CHIPPED STONE IMPLEMENTS

Arrow Points
Arrow points, totaling 70 specimens, were found on the
surface and to a depth of 18 inches. For a detailed stratigraphic distribution see chart below; for illustrations of
various types see Plate 2, AA-GG.

Scallorn is the most common type, being represented by
21 points. It occurred most frequently in the six to twelve
inch zone; however over half of all the arrow points from
the site were from this depth and the concentration of Seallorn in this zone does not seem significant. The majority of
the points are corner-notched with prominent, often barbed
shoulders and strongly expanding stems. Bases vary from
straight, gently concave, to convex. Only one point (Plate
2, F) is definitely side-notched. As a group the Scallorn
points are well-made, with fine marginal chipping which
often produced tiny serrations.
Most numerous of the triangular arrow points is Fresno,
which consists of eight specimens. Seven have concave
bases; the eighth has a gently convex base. Several are
very small, 1 to 1.5 em. in length, while the largest is 3 em.
long. The blade of one point (Plate 2, L) is serrated.
One triangular point is classified as Starr because of its
three concave edges. It was the only projectile point found
in Test Pit D, at the western extremity of the site. Another
triangular arrow-point type, Young, is represented by six
specimens. These range in workmanship from poorly-made,
simply trimmed flakes, to fairly well-chipped points. They
are distinguished from Fresno points by their larger size,
shape and somewhat poorer chipping. Two Young points
(Plate 2, CC, DD) have faint suggestions of a stem, but

they are not definite enough to be classified as Cliffton
points.
Most of the eight Perdiz points are thin, crudely-chipped
flakes. It is important to note-in view of the two recent
reports of the superposition of Perdiz over Scallorn (Jelks,
1953; Anonymous, 1954}-that there was no stratigraphic
separation of Perdiz and Scallorn points here. In several
squares they were found within the same six-inch level.
However, the difference in frequency (21 Scallorn as opposed to 8 Perdiz ) possibly has chronological implications.
Perhaps Perdiz points were just being introduced into the
area and had not become a popular style. It is also possible
that the association of Perdiz points with ScaHorn points is
due to a slow rate of alluvial deposition combined with
mechanical disturbances that occurred during occupation ot
the site by aboriginal groups. There may be some significance in the absence of Cliffton points which consistently occur at sites where Perdiz is well represented.
A small point having a triangular blade and slender rectangular stem with shallow V-shaped basal notch is identified as Cuney (Plate 2, V) . Cuney is more common in central-east Texas, where it appears primarily in historic context.

Alba, represented by two specimens, is the only other
arrow-point type recognized. Both have rectangular stems
and straight blade edges. Concave blade edges are more
typical of east Texas Alba points, whereas this feature is
rare or absent in central Texas.
The remaining arrow points consist of 18 fragments too
incomplete for identification and five points which could
not be classified. Three of the unclassified points (Plate 2,
X-Z) have slightly expanding stems with convex bases and
blade edges that vary from straight, to convex, and concave. In some respects they are reminiscent of both Scallorn
and Alba, but to include them with either of these types
would obscure their distinctiveness. Their recognition as a

24

Texas A rcheological Society

separate type or extreme variant of Scallorn or Alba should
depend upon additional distributional data.
One of the remaining untyped specimens is a small point
with a slightly expanding, deeply bifurcated stem (Plate 2,
W). A similar specimen is illustrated by Huskey (1935,
Plate 15, second from the right). Though somewhat similar
to Cuney, it differs enough to make identification with that
type uncertain. The fifth unclassified point (Plate 2, AA),
a slender triangular specimen, is notably longer than the
other arrow points, but it is light and does not fit into the
dart-point category. The base is slightly concave, somewhat reminiscent-probably fortuitously-of Maud points in
east Texas.

Dart Points
A total of 287 dart points was recovered; of these 60 are
too fragmentary for classification and seven cannot be assigned to any recognized type. The remaining 220 are identified as belonging to 24 types.

ology. Although the range of variation is discussed and
illustrated in that publication, there are several projectile
point features and type groupings which should be elaborated before considering the distributional data.
Ensor, represented by the largest number of identifiable
points (39), includes all side-notched specimens from this
site which have lateral edges of the stem approximately in
line with the blade edges. About a third of the Ensor points
have concave bases, a greater frequency than has been noted
elsewhere (Miller and Jelks, 1952, p. 172; Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks, 1954, pp. 422-3, Plate 90).
Approximately a third of the 17 Darl points have alternately beveled blade edges; only one has the lateral edges
of the stem smoothed. Beveling of the blade also occurs on
four of the six Tortugas points, four of the 39 Ensor points,
one of the 10 Lange points, one of the 14 Bulverde points, and
one of the nine Nolan points.
The five specimens recognized as Pandora points (Plate 4,
P, Q) overlap with the knives, but are narrower and lighter
than knives. The same possibility may apply to the six
Kinney points (Plate 4, W, AA) and two Refugio points
(Plate 4, J, K). There are resemblances between the five
Edgewood points (Plate 3, F, G) and the single Uvalde point
(Plate 3, H), but Uvalde has a deeper basal notch, the stem
is less expanding, and it is larger (the illustrated point appears to have been reworked). The point illustrated in
Plate 3, AA is identified as Pedernales despite the shallow
base notch. All but one of the other 32 Pedernales points
have deep basal notches (Plate 3, Z, BB). The Palmillas
point (Plate 4, G) is distinguished from the four Williams
points (Plate 4, H, I) principally by its smaller size. One
of the 14 points identified as Bulverde (Plate 4, T) has an
exceptionally long stem, but is probably a variant of that
type.
A point found in one of the gullies has a number of the
characteristics of the Scottsbluff type - parallel flaking,
thick cross-section, slightly off-set stem, and faint smoothing

28

along lateral edges of the stem. However, several of these
features are not pronounced enough to make the identification certain. If this is an early type point, it is the only one
found at the site (Plate 4, CC) .
The seven unclassified points include t w o specimens
(Plate 4, V, X) which are short and broad with strongly
expanding stems and deeply concave bases. They came from
the surface, 6 to 12 and 18 to 24 inch levels. The remaining
untyped specimens are two points (Plate 4, Y, Z) which have
long and narrow stems, triangular blades, and weak shoulders (from 18-24 and 30-36 inch levels respectively); one
long and narrow triangular point (Plate 4, BB) from the
18-24 inch levels has slight smoothing along the lateral edges;
and one small corner-notched point (Plate 4, F) has long
barbs and expanded, straight-based stem (from 12 to 18 inch
level).
In examining the above frequencies and stratigraphic data,
it should be recalled that only five of the 30 squares were
excavated to a depth exceeding thirty-six inches. This will
account, in part, for the greater number of points in the
upper six zones. However, it was apparent in the field that
as digging proceeded into the deeper levels there was a
notable decrease in cultural material. As another word of
caution, it should be emphasized that the six-inch levels are
arbitrary and that within these zones the position of a point
was not recorded. And, finally , as many types are sparsely
represented, any conclusions are very tentative.
All types listed here have been noted elsewhere (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p. 108) as occurring in the Edwards
Plateau Aspect. The frequency tabulation is about what one
would expect, with the possible exception of Williams, Marshall, and Uvalde which are not common.

This stratigraphic position of DarL and Ensor confirms
earlier suspicions (Miller and Jelks, 1952, p. 172) of late
Edwards Plateau and early Central Texas Aspect affiliations. This may not apply to Ellis nor Edgewood as has been
suggested (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p . 108).
In even a cursory examination of the chart it is apparent
that the greatest range of dart styles occur within the upper
twenty-four inches. Some forms such as Pandora, AbasoLo,
Frio, and Kinney may not have spread into the Austin vicinity until late Edwards Plateau Aspect time, being found
more often in sites to the west and southwest of this area.
Gradual accretions to the dart-point styles, coupled with a
lingering on of other forms such as Pedernales, Bulverde,
and Nolan would certainly augment the variety of forms .
An alternative speculation is that the site, in the later phases
of its occupation, was frequented more often by different
groups. This latter explanation, however, assumes vague
and flexible or frequently changing territorial boundariessomewhat contrary to the situation usually noted for hunting and gathering peoples on the ethnological level.
It is possible to distinguish three levels based upon the
distribution of dart-point types. The lowest levels are those
below 36 inches, represented primarily by Pedernales, Bulverde, and Nolan points. The middle level, 18 to 36 inches,
marks the appearance of a number of new types at the site,
including Ensor, Darl, Marco s, William s, Marshall, Edgewood, and several others. The uppermost level, surface to
18 inches, is the zone of mixture of dart points, arrow points,
and pottery. This last zone may indicate a survival of most
dart-point types into the early phases of the Central Texas
Aspect. Again, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the
above zoning is based upon a small number of specimens. At
best, the distributions offer some suggestions as to the
relative chronology of dart-point types.

Other attempts to divide the Edwards Plateau Aspect into
levels or smaller cultural units (phases or foci) include the
schemes of Pearce (1932, p. 49) , Sayles (1935) , Huskey (1935,

p. 108), and Kelley (1947a, 1947b). These breakdowns, like
the one presented above, are based almost entirely upon
stratigraphic and/or areal distributions of dart-point types.
The data at the Collins Site correspond most closely with
Pearce's bottom, middle and upper zones; whereas there
was relatively little evidence to support the other three
classifications.

Knives
The 186 knives are represented principally by tip and
medial fragments too incomplete for classification. However, 71 can be grouped according to shape.
Oval-shaped knives (Plate 5, F, G, J), ranging in length
from 6.5 to 12 em. and 3.5 to 6.5 em. in width, constitute the
largest category (27 specimens). Bases are slightly to
strongly convex. Nineteen knives have roughly parallel
blade edges with bases straight, concave, or convex (Plate
5, D, I). They measure 7.5 to 12 em. in length and 3.5 to
5 em. in width. Triangular forms (Plate 5, L, M) consist
of 13 specimens and are the third most frequent group.
Bases are concave or convex, but not straight. One specimen
(Plate 5, L), of exceptional workmanship, has serrations
along the blade edges and the base. It is the only knife
that may be associated exclusively with the Central Texas
Aspect.
Minor forms include five lanceolate knives (Plate 5, E),
a diamond-shaped knife having alternate bevels at one end
(Plate 5, A), two double-pointed knives (Plate 5, K), one
corner-tang knife (Plate 5, H), three assymetrical forms
(Plate 5, C, N), and two stemmed knives (Plate 5, B).
Both stemmed knives bear some resemblance to Pedernales
points, but the stems are notably shorter and the overall
dimensions, much larger. The corner-tang knife, found on
the surface, appears to be a reworked specimen, possibly
made from a larger knife.
With the exception m entioned above, all knife forms found
in place occurred in the lower levels in Edwards Plateau

34

Texas Archeological Society

Aspect context. In addition, most continued into the upper
zones (e. g., above 18 inches) with little change in frequency.
The mixture of Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects
in the upper levels makes it difficult to determine the affiliations of the knives from these zones. Probably most continued to be used by people of the Central Texas Aspect,
but this can be answered better by data from less mixed
sites.
Scrapers

Sixty-six plano-convex implements are classified as scrapers. These are further grouped into snub-nosed, large end
and/or side scrapers, concave scrapers, and turtle-backed,
depending upon the size, position of the scraping edge and
cross-section.
The 21 snub-nosed scrapers were made from relatively
thin, sometimes curved flakes and have blunt, well-made
bits. With one exception, chipping is confined to the bits
and lateral edges, and in all instances the bit is convex.
Marginal retouching occurs on the lateral edges of all specimens and evidently was to form cutting or scraping edges,
rather than to shape the body of the scraper.
On the basis of size the snub-nosed scrapers fall into two
well-defined categories. One group (Plate 6, F, G) consists
of 14 scrapers which are small, ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 em.
in length, .5 to 1.5 em. in thickness (at the bit end), and 3
to 5 em. in width. The remaining five (Plate 6, M, N) measure 7 to 10 em. in length, 1 to 1.5 em. in thickness (at bit
end), and 4.5 to 6 em. in width. There was no significant
difference in the distribution of these two groups.
All but two of the snub-nosed scrapers were found with
pottery and thus appear to belong primarily to the Central
Texas Aspect occupation. However, a small and a large one
occurred below the pottery and arrow-point zone, in association with Edwards Plateau artifacts. There were no indications of any mixture and all evidence suggests that snubnosed scrapers appeared in Central Texas before pottery

and arrow points, attaining greatest popularity in the Central Texas Aspect.
Forty-one of the scrapers can be characterized as large
and poorly made with unifacial chipping along one or more
edges (Plate 7, H, I, 0). Outline shapes vary from disc to
oval and to rectangular. Scraping edges in a few instances
are quite sinuous and in almost all cases a portion of the
crusted surface of the flint nodule is visible. Positions of
the scraping edges are variable: 15 are on the end; four
combine end and one lateral edge; five are chipped along
one end and both sides; seven have scraping edges along
both sides; and 10 are chipped along one side. These large
scrapers were more common in the deeper levels, particularly between 24 and 36 inches, but continued into the
upper zones.
Only three concave scrapers or spokeshaves (Plate 6, B,
I), one from the surface and the other two from Edwards
Plateau Aspect context, were found at the Collins Site. One
had a small graver point on the edge opposite the concavity
(Plate 6, B).
Two scrapers are classified as "turtle-backed" because of a
high medial ridge which tapers toward the proximal end.
Both are well-made and roughly oval in outline. The bluntness of the distal ends suggests that they may be merely
well-made end scrapers, but they stand out in workmanship
and in shape. The distal ends and both lateral edges show
some evidence of use. Both are from the upper levels, associated with pottery.
Gouges
This class of chipped-stone implements numbering 15
specimens, overlaps the end scrapers, but is set apart primarily because of specialized bits which possibly indicate
uses different from end scrapers.
Ten of the gouges fall within the range of the Clear Fork
type, first described by Ray (1929, 1938). Four of these are
unifacially chipped and triangular to almost rectangular in

38

Texas Archeological Society

shape, with straight to slightly convex bits (Plate 7, A-C) .
Three are bifacially chipped, triangular in shape and have
concave bits (Plate 7, D-E) . One of the triangular planoconvex gouges is considerably narrower than the others, but
it has all the other characteristics of the Clear Fork gouge
(Plate 7, B) . The remaining three gouges consist of proximal fragments . Considerable variation is allowed in the
Clear Fork gouge, as finer divisions are difficult to make
without more descriptive and distributional data than are
available at present.
Stratigraphic positions of the Clear Fork gouges were
variable: two of the plano-convex ones occurred in the 54
to 66 inch zone and were among the most deeply buried
artifacts excavated. The other gouges were found within
and below the pottery and arrow-point level. However, the
Clear Fork gouges appear to be associated primarily with
the Edwards Plateau Aspect.
The other five gouges, all found between 18 and 36 inches,
differ considerably from the Clear Fork series. They are
oblong to almost rectangular in shape (5.5 to 10 em. long,
3 to 6 em. at the mid-section, and 1.5 to 3.4 em. in maximum
thickness), bi-convex, and have bits which are transverse
to the blade at a slight angle (Plate 7, F -G) . In longitudinal
section they resemble an irregularly-shaped lens which has
been severed diagonally across one end. The bits, which
are the most distinctive feature, appear to have been well
adapted for hollowing or scooping. Only one of these gouges
has a bit at both ends.
Although based on a small sample, the latter five gouges
were found only in the upper Edwards Plateau levels, below
pottery. The Clear Fork type, however, was found in the
deeper zones, continuing with a slight decrease in number
into the upper zones. These data suggest that the Clear
Fork gouge is the earlier of the two, at least in the Austin
vicinity, but this should be checked further at sites where
both are present in larger numbers.

Gravers
Chipped-stone implements with short, beak-like projections are classified as gravers (Plate 6, A-C). The 21 from
the Collins Site were made from large to small irregularlyshaped flakes, with a minimum amount of marginal retouching to shape the graver point. Frequently a graver and
scraper were combined on one specimen (Plate 6, B). Only
one has two graver points.
Most of the projections are too short for boring purposes,
but are well suited for cutting or incising material such as
bone, shell, or pottery. Gravers occurred from the surface
to a depth of 60 inches with no particular concentration in
any zone.
Utilized Flakes
Irregularly-shaped flakes with marginal retouching along
one or more edges have been referred to variously as flake
scrapers, utilized flakes , and retouched flakes. They are
common in many archeological sites and probably constitute
one of the simplest and most useful stone tools. The retouched edges are serviceable for many cutting and scraping
purposes. At the Collins Site 111 utilized flakes were found
(Plate 6, D, E) , represented with about equal frequency
in all levels.
Drills
The only complete drill was a large specimen, 10 em. long,
possibly rechipped from a slender, lanceolate-shaped knife
(Plate 6, J) . The other drills consist of five shaft fragments,
two of which are alternately beveled. None was found below
a depth of 24 inches. One of these fragments (Plate 6, L) ,
from the top 6 inch level, appeared to be a portion of a
small flake drill, characteristic of the Central Texas Aspect.
Heavy Blades
Of the 96 bifacially-chipped blades from the site, 31 are
fragments. Those complete or nearly so vary mainly in
shape, being grouped into: oval (32) , rectangular or parallel-

42

Texas Archeological Society

sided (22), circular (5), triangular (4 specimens-3 with
convex bases, the other concave), and irregular (2). Otherwise, the blades are similar in being crudely chipped, often
retaining a portion of the flint nodule crust, thick and relatively large. They range in length from 6 to 16 em., in width
from 4 to 11 em., and in thickness from 1.5 to 5 em. Blades
of all shapes occurred in all layers, although approximately
60 per cent of them were from unmixed Edwards Plateau
Aspect levels.
These tools are sometimes referred to as axes, as they are
suitable for chopping. Although the edges of many are
badly battered as one would expect of an axe, a number
evidence very little wear. Some probably served as heavy
knives, but the blade edges are not usually sharp. A few no
doubt are merely cores, the residue from which flakes for
projectile points, etc., were removed. Most must have been
hafted as they are awkward to hold in the hand.
The 96 blades, particularly when combined with other
heavy chipped-stone implements (choppers, heavy scrapers,
etc.), constitute a rather high percentage of the artifacts
from this site. A similar frequency prevails in many sites
in central Texas. This may be due, in part, to the "catchall" nature of this category. On the other hand, they must
have been simply-made tools and judging from their appearance little time was spent in manufacturing them. It
seems plausible that semi-nomadic groups, such as are suggested for the Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects,
would be reluctant to burden themselves with such implements when moving from one campsite to another, especially
in an area such as central Texas where flint is so abundant.
In short, the striking occurrence of heavy flint artifacts
(including choppers, heavy scrapers and blades) might be
attributed to availability of raw material, coupled with
periodic moving of camp.
Choppers

The choppers consist of heavy flint nodules with a blade
along one edge. All have a portion of the nodule crust on

the edge opposite the blade. This proximal end conveniently
fits the palm and is smooth so that it would not cut the user.
Twenty-two of the 30 choppers are very crudely made
and have broad, sinuous cutting edges (Plate 8, G) . Although almost every blade gives evidence of usage, four
are extremely battered. Probably these four were re-utilized
as hammerstones (Plate 8, A). If so, they constitute the
only hammerstones recognized at the site.
Three specimens have narrower blades than the above.
One, from the uppermost 6-inch zone, is well-made, with a
carefully chipped convex blade (Plate 8, H) . This type is
sometimes referred to as a "hand-axe. " The other two
specimens (such as Plate 8, D) are more like picks, although the cutting edges are blunt rather than pointed. In
workmanship they more closely resemble the other choppers than the hand-axe. The two "picks" were from the
surface and the 60-to 66-inch zone.
Seven of the choppers were found at depths below 18
inches, and an additional 11 were from the surface. The
remainder were excavated in the upper 18 inches.
Flake Choppers
This term is suggested for six chipped-stone implements
which closely resemble the choppers, except that they are
made from large flakes rather than cores (a small one is
illustrated in Plate 6, K). Like the choppers, they have a
portion of the flint nodule cortex opposite the blade edge.
The blade edge of each specimen shows evidence of use,
perhaps as a heavy knife. The five flake choppers found in
place were from the upper 18 inches, suggesting that they
may be associated primarily with the Central Texas Aspect.
They range from 7.5 to 12 em. in length and 4 to 6.5 em. in
width.
Ground-Stone Artifacts
Milling slabs and manos are the only ground-stone artifacts found at the site. Only one of the five milling slabs

46

Texas Archeological Society

is complete. It has a very small basin-shaped depression
and weighs about 25 pounds. Rotary motion, indicated by
the basin-shaped depression, is characteristic of all milling
slabs. Three are limestone, one is montmorillonite clay, and
one is a granite-like material. Only one is worn on both
faces. They came from both Edwards Plateau and Central
Texas Aspect levels.
Only four manos were recovered, a rather small number
compared to most sites in central Texas. Two manos are
quartzite, one quartz, and one granite. One mano found on
the surface is almost wedge-shaped in cross-section; another
is quite small, worn on all edges, but lacks a definite flat
surface (Plate 6, 0) . This latter specimen was found in the
small depression of the complete milling stone, at a depth
of about 18 inches below the surface. The remaining two
manos, both from the surface, are oval in shape and worn
flat on both surfaces. One of these latter has a shallow
longitudinal depression across the center of both faces .
These depressions are smooth, but are not narrow and deep
enough to suggest use as a shaft smoother; their purpose
is unknown.z

Miscellaneous Stone Artifacts
Three flat, limestone pebbles (Plate 6, P, Q) have deep
notches chipped in the lateral edges. All are stream worn
and are oval to rectangular in shape, ranging from 7.5 to
9 em. in length, 4.5 to 6 em. in width across notches, and 1.5
to 2.2 em. in thickness. None are battered at the ends , although the edges are sometimes battered, probably a result
of chipping the notches (Plate 6, P). These side-notched
pebbles are sometimes referred to as "sinkers", as they may
have been fastened to fish nets as weights. Although none
was found in place, they probably belong to the Edwards
Plateau Aspect occupation (Jackson, 1938, p. 78; Watt, 1938,
p. 31).
2. The reader is referred to the article in this Bulletin by John
Henry Ray, "Peculiar Manos from Lower Pease River Valley," for
other examples of such manos (Editor).

Excavation s at the Collins Site , Trav is County, Texas

47

A roughly elliptical piece of thin slate (Plate 6, R) is
lightly scored on both faces. A portion of the edge is worn
to a thin, flat facet. The slate measures 10.4 em. long, 5.5 em.
across the center, and is .7 em. in thickness. A considerably larger piece of limestone also has numerous longitudinal striations across one face . While both of these may
have been used as hones, the striations are short and very
shallow. An alternative and perhaps more plausible explanation is that they served as anvils in the cutting of
hides, fibers, etc. The scores could be compared to the marks
on a breadboard. Both were found in Edwards Plateau
levels.
A number of well-worn pebbles, of a variety of materials,
was found in various levels. These are far too large to have
been deposited by the creek. They must have been carried
in by human agency, although none show any definite indications of use.

Artifacts of Bone and Antler
Neither bone nor antler artifacts are common, presumably
due mainly to conditions of preservation. Of particular interest are two bone fishhooks , shaped much like modern
metal ones. One is nearly complete (Plate 7, K) and measures 4 em. in length and 1.2 em. across the lower end. The
other is a distal fragment. Both came from the 12 to 18 inch
layer, a zone of mixture of Edwards Plateau and Central
Texas Aspects. Although of very rare occurrence in central
Texas, one has been reported from a Central Texas component (Gatewood Site, Travis County, University of Texas
files) . It seems likely that the fishhooks from the Collins
Site are also associated with the Central Texas Aspect.
It is difficult to determine how the fishhooks were made,
but they must have been fashioned from the hard outer
layer of a relatively thick bone, possibly deer or bison. A
method of manufacturing a similarly shaped fishhook from
a deer toe bone is described in the Tenne ssee Archeo logist
(Anonymous, 1953, p. 240) and perhaps those from the Collins Site were made in a like manner.

Fragments of four splinter awls or pins constitute the
most common type of bone artifact. Three of these are from
definite Edwards Plateau Aspect context (below 30 inches);
the other was found in a mixed zone so that its cultural
affiliation is hard to ascertain. All four appear to have been
cut from leg bones (deer?) , then further shaped by smoothing. However, none is complete so that the total form cannot
be determined. There is no evidence of any decoration on
the awls. Discontinuous striations, visible on all specimens,
may represent scars from manufacture or incurred through
use. The tip of the most nearly complete awl (Plate 7, J)
tapers to a somewhat rounded point and shows signs of
wear. Such an implement would be useful as a punch in
weaving and sewing.
Although not complete, there are two deer ulnae which
may have been utilized as tools. Their edges are slightly
worn and they have vertical striations which appear to be
the result of usage; however the critical distal ends are
missing. Deer ulnae with cut and rounded distal ends are
believed to have been used as flaking tools. The unaltered
proximal end neatly fits into the hand and enables one to
secure a firm grip on the tool. The ulnae were excavated
within the upper 18 inches and may belong to either or
both aspects.
Two cylindrical, undecorated bone beads (Plate 7, L, M),
2 and 1.2 em. long respectively, were found in the 6 to 12
and 18 to 24 inch layers. They are apparently associated
with both the Central Texas and Edwards Plateau Aspects.
Similar bone beads have been found in Central Texas Aspect sites, but their occurrence in the Edwards Plateau Aspect is very rare.
None of the four fragmentary antler artifacts is complete enough for positive identification and one can only
speculate on what they might have been. A fragment from
near a deer skull has little evidence of having been altered,
except that one end has been cut and smoothed. It appears
to have been cylindrical in shape, possibly similar to the
drill (?) handle described for the Edwards Plateau Aspect

Excavations at the Collins Site, Travis County , Texas

(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p. 110). It came from the
6 to 12 inch level. The other three are tips of antlers, possibly the distal ends of flaking tools (Plate 7, N). One is
from the 6 to 12 inch zone, the other two from 18 to 24
inches.

Summary and Conclusions
Occupation of the Collins Site can be attributed to the
Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects. Deeper zones
contained unmixed Edwards Plateau Aspect material,
whereas evidence of both aspects was found in the upper
18 inches. A Central Texas Aspect component was recognized primarily on the basis of the limited distributionwithin the first 18 inches-of arrow points and pottery. It
is these two traits which contrast most sharply with the
Edwards Plateau Aspect. With several exceptions, the remaining artifacts were distributed throughout the site,
though often varying considerably in frequency.
These two aspects are customarily analyzed as separate
cultural units, with emphasis placed on the differences between them. This approach is certainly not without good
foundation, but perhaps not enough attention has been directed to the similarities that exist between them. Correspondingly, the problem of their relationship has only been
briefly mentioned (Kelley, 1947a, 1947b; Stephenson, 1951).
The situation at the Collins Site calls attention to this problem and may contribute to the solving of it.
Undoubtedly some, or perhaps all, of the Edwards Plateau
Aspect artifacts are accidental intrusions into the upper
zones (i. e., picked up and possibly re-used and/or mixed
as a result of the activities of subsequent occupation, such as
would occur in the digging of pits, etc.) The Collins Site
is not unique in this respect as similar overlaps have been
reported elsewhere (Jackson, 1938; 1939; Kelley, 1947b; Miller and Jelks, 1952). However, it may be questioned that
such incidents can account for all of the mixture. It is possible, as has been suggested by Kelley (1947a, p . 107; 1947b,
p. 121), that the Edwards Plateau and Central Texas As-

50

Texas Archeological Society

pects were contemporaneous for a small part of their total
existence and that the Indians of each aspect frequented the
site at different intervals. An alternative possibility is that
the upper zones represent, at least in part, the transitional
period between the Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects-a time when several new traits were being accepted, but had not entirely replaced older ones.
Despite the absence of empirical data to the contrary, it
is highly improbable that the bow and pottery are local
inventions. The concepts, if not actual specimens, of these
items probably spread into central Texas from an adjacent
region (or regions?), though the source has not been identified to date. However, this does not necessarily mean that
these traits were accompanied by a change in the population
of central Texas. 3 Unfortunately there is no information on
skeletal remains available for comparative studies, to determine whether or not different populations are represented.
There is evidence suggesting that Central Texas Aspect is
by and large a development out of the Edwards Plateau
Aspect, with distinctive accretions. The total distribution
in Texas of the two complexes is approximately the same,
and components of both aspects are commonly represented
at a single site. In addition, many artifacts appear to be
shared, and the tool inventory is essentially Â·the same. More
importantly, certain cultural traditions, so far as can be reconstructed from archeological data, remained basically unchanged. Hunting, supplemented by food-collecting, continued to be the principal means of livelihood. Because of
the presence of trade pottery obtained from agricultural
Caddoan groups to the east, it is probable that people of
the Central Texas Aspect were at least aware of plant
domestication. However, with some possible exceptions in
regions nearest the Caddo, there is no good evidence that
3. It is not clear whether or not Kelley (1947a, 1947b) regards
the people of the Central Texas Aspect as ethnically distinct from
those of the Edwards Plateau Aspect.

agriculture was ever actually practiced in central Texas.
Its failure to spread here may lie primarily in the deeplyrooted non-agricultural economy of central Texas, based on
an abundance of natural food products, rather than any climatic or physiographic factors.
All known habitation areas of both aspects are campsites
of a more or less temporary nature, as opposed to the village
sites of sedentary groups. Admittedly, Edwards Plateau
Aspect sites are usually larger and thicker, presumably
because they were occupied for a longer time than those of
the Central Texas Aspect. It can be inferred that these sites
represent favored camping spots of hunting and gathering
groups, to which they returned repeatedly. One might
speculate further that the prevailing type of social organization of both aspects was that of a band, which in turn probably consisted of a variable number of families, such as has
been described for the historic Coahuiltecan (Ruecking,
1954) and to some extent for the Tonkawa (Sjoberg, 1953,
pp. 289-90) . These bands might have been further grouped
into a loose tribal organization, bound by a common language and culture.
If the above assumptions are valid, which is by no means
certain, it seems likely that there was a transitional period
between the two aspects. Identification of this hypothetical
period is difficult, but there are some indications . Excavations at Blum Rockshelter in Hill County (Jelks, 1953)
and at Smith Rockshelter (Anonymous, 1954 ; Suhm, 1955)
recovered occupations in the lowest levels which were not
typical of either the Edwards Plateau or the Central Texas
Aspect. The lowest zone at Smith Rockshelter can be tied
in with the nearby Collins Site largely through the common presence of Darl points. 4 How much (if any) of the
upper 18 inches at the Collins Site can be attributed to this
hypothetical phase is uncertain.
4. In the Blum Rockshelter, Yarb rough rather than Darl points
occurred in the lowest levels. The t wo types are quite similar and
were probably contemporaneous.

The Edwards Plateau Aspect has been divided into three
foci (Round Rock, Clear F ork, and Uvalde) on the basis of
a single dominant type of dart point for each (Kelley, 1947a,
1947b) . The Central Texas Aspect has been divided into
the two foci (Toyah and Austin) on the basis of a single
dominant type of arrow point for each (Idem) . At the Collins Site, as well as many other sites in Central Texas, the
projectile-point types for all of these foci occur. The writer
has therefore preferred to discuss this site only in terms of
the Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects.
Dating the Collins Site occupation is difficult and at present can only be stated in general terms. A large number of
charcoal and snail-shell samples was collected for radiocarbon dating, but none have been analyzed as yet. From the
absence of European objects in association with Indian material, it is assumed the site was abandoned not later than
about 1600 A D. The beginning of occupation cannot be
determined but quite probably preceded the Christian era
by a considerable time. A geological analysis of the terrace
deposits which accumulated along with human occupation
has not been attempted here, but should provide some age
estimates when done.

LITTLE SUNDAY: AN ARCHAIC SITE
IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE
JACK

T.

HUGHES

As recently pointed out by Suhm, Krieger and Jelks in
their Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology (1954, p.
63), practically nothing is known about the Archaic Stage
in the Texas Panhandle, and "The definition of cultural remains in this gap is an important future problem for Texas
archeology." Their statement that "no sites have yet been
located where a definite complex can be defined" (p. 66)
is not strictly accurate, for the archeological survey conducted by the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum since
1952 has revealed a great many Archaic sites in the Panhandle. However, it is true that no reports had been published on these sites up to that time. The purpose of this
article is to help remedy this situation (see also: Tunnell
and Hughes, 1955).
Although none of the Archaic sites located by the Museum
has been excavated, and few of them have been tested, surface examinations at several have produced significant results. Considering this fact, and the urgent need for data
on the Archaic Stage in the Panhandle, it seems worthwhile
to report initial work at one of these sites, pending future
excavation. For this purpose one of the richest and purest
localities so far discovered, the Little Sunday site (designated A160 in the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
records), has been chosen.
Archaic sites in the Panhandle are of several different
kinds, and have produced a wide variety of remains. This
diversity is readily understood when it is realized that the
Archaic Stage was several thousand years long-enough
time for much cultural change even at the slow rate of
simple cultures. It should be kept in mind, therefore, that
the Little Sunday site is not necessarily typical of all sites
throughout the Panhandle during the entire Archaic Stage.
The complex represented at the Little Sunday site is yet
to be fully defined culturally, geographically, and chronologically; there are other Archaic complexes in the Pan-

handle whose definition has not yet begun; and probably
there are others whose existence is not yet even suspected.

The Region
The Little Sunday site is on the Edd Reynolds ranch in
eastern Randall County, Texas. It is on the northwest rim
of Little Sunday Canyon, which drains northeastward into
Palo Duro Canyon. Palo Duro Canyon, which drains southeastward, has been cut into the eastern Caprock Escarpment
of the Staked Plains by the Prairie Dog Town Fork of Red
River. Little Sunday Creek joins the Prairie Dog Town
Fork within the boundaries of Palo Duro State Park, and
on the southeast side of Little Sunday Canyon, the Lighthouse, a prominent erosional feature familiar to many park
visitors, is visible to the east from the Little Sunday site.
The Staked Plains are a high piedmont sloping eastward
from the Rockies, bounded on the north by the breaks of
the South Canadian River, on the east by a tall jagged
escarpment eroded by the headwaters of the Red, Brazos,
and Colorado rivers, and on the west by the valley of the
Pecos River. To the south the Staked Plains merge with the
Edwards Plateau. In the vicinity of the Little Sunday site
the Caprock Escarpment has an elevation of about 3400
feet, and the Prairie Dog Town Fork and its tributaries
have cut through several hundred feet of the nearly horizontal sedimentary formations which underlie the present
surface of the Staked Plains: Pleistocene loesses at the
top; light-colored caliches and sands of the Ogallala formation (Pliocene); massive Trujillo sandstones and colorful Tecovas shales of the Dockum series (Upper Triassic);
and red beds of the Quartermaster formation (Uppermost
Permian) at the bottom.
Climatically, this is a land of extremes, with a temperature that rises and falls rapidly over a wide diurnal and
annual range. Both heat and cold, however, are greatly
ameliorated by the aridity, so that the weather is pleasant
most of the time. Winds blow continually during most of

the year, prevailingly from the southwest. Cold "northers"
strike suddenly in winter, but do not last long.
The Staked Plains are a broad, level expanse of grassland
interrupted occasionally by narrow, winding strips of woodland reaching westward up the rare stream courses. Near
the Little Sunday site mesquites border the canyons, and
prominent among the profusion of trees and other vegetation within the canyons are junipers and cottonwoods. Until
recently, bison and antelope on the plains and deer in the
breaks were the principal game animals of the region. Migratory waterfowl are important among the game birds of
the Staked Plains, since the region with its countless playa
lakes is a major flyway.

The Site
The Little Sunday site was discovered on October 5,
1954, by University of California vertebrate paleontologist

Dr. Don E. Savage and a party of students prospecting for
fossils. Dr. Savage took me to the site on the afternoon of
its discovery and I returned to it later that afternoon with
another student group. A few days later, on October 10, I
visited the site again with my family. Considering the
abundance of artifacts on the surface around the site, its
inconspicuous position, and its inaccessibility, I doubt that
it had been searched before its discovery by Dr. Savage.
The site lies near the bottom of an eroded slope which
stretches down from a flat interfluvial divide on the north
to the sharp rim of Little Sunday Canyon on the south.
It is a relatively small, roughly triangular patch of soil
stabilized by sod, an erosional island surrounded by washes
and sloping eastward, contrary to the general southward
drainage around it. The cultural remains are buried in the
soil, which lies on an erosional surface of similar eastward
slope. It is evident that local topography has undergone
considerable change since this surface was formed. That
some of this change has taken place since the site was established on this surface, and is still taking place, is shown by
the thickness of the cultural zone exposed at the heads of

58

Texas Archeological Society

the steep washes along the high west and south sides of
the erosional island, and by the amount of camp debris in
the washes-signs that much of the site has been removed
along these sides and is still being removed.
The features that made this particular place attractive as
a camp site are not readily apparent. The nearest water
today consists of springs in the canyon below and playas
on the flat above, although it is possible that some more
convenient supply existed at the time the site was occupied.
The washes which surround the site reveal that what is
left of the occupational zone rests on the fairly even, eastward sloping, erosional surface of a compact, highly calcareous, reddish sand which outcrops as bedrock at this
level along the slope above the canyon rim. The cultural
materials are contained in a relatively soft, humus darkened,
brownish sand which reaches a thickness of more than 2
feet along the steeply washed south and west edges of the
erosional island, and pinches out to the east. This deposit
is covered with grass, in contrast with the denuded slopes
around it.
Along the west and south edges of this deposit, where it
is well exposed, flint chips, fire-darkened hearth rocks, and
heat-cracked pebbles (probably used for "stone boiling"
cooking) are visible from top to bottom of its outcrop, and
are especially numerous in the lower part. The adjoining
washes are littered with similar remains. Rock hearths of
undetermined size and shape, accompanied by pieces of
charcoal and bison bone, are being uncovered by erosion at
a few places in the deposit. Future excavation of these
features promises to add much to present knowledge of the
cultural content of the archeological complex responsible
for the site, and to provide materials for radiocarbon dating.
It remains to be determined to what extent the deposit
enclosing the camp debris consists of reworked local sand
washed onto the site from its formerly higher surroundings,
or of wind-blown sand like that found at places on the interfluvial divide above the site.

The Artifacts
Surface collecting to date has produced 160 artifacts.
Although some of these were taken out of the occupational
level, most were picked up in the surrounding washes. Except for two specimens of shell, all artifacts are of stone.
Of the 158 stone artifacts, 146 are chipped implements
and 12 are grinding tools.
Most (107) of the 146 chipped stone artifacts are composed of local materials, 35 are from more distant sources,
and four are of uncertain origin. The local materials are Tecovas jasper (73 specimens), a bright-colored, ledge-forming rock in Triassic outcrops of the eastern Caprock Escarpment; Ogallala chert (32) , a drab, grainy stone occurring
in basal gravels of local Pliocene beds; and silicified wood
(2) , obtainable from nearby sources. The foreign materials
are the well-known Ali bates flint (20), a silicified dolomite
of Permian age from quarries in the Canadian River valley
north of Amarillo; the fine gray flint from Cretaceous formations in Central Texas (12) , which will be referred to
here as Edwards flint ; and Dakota quartzite (3) , a pastelcolored metamorphosed sandstone of Cretaceous age outcropping along the western Caprock Escarpment in New
Mexico. Although the materials of a few specimens may
have been mistakenly identified, I believe the identifications
are essentially correct. If they are reliable, they indicate a
group of people depending mainly on local sources, hence
probably residents of the area rather than travelers through
it, but having some direct or indirect connections to the
north, southeast, and west, in that order of importance. A
more thorough study of flint sources in this and adjoining
areas would yield valuable information.
Seventy-nine of the chipped stone artifacts are unifacially
flaked , 67 are bifacially flaked.
The 79 unifaces are of three main kinds: 72 scrapers, five
gravers, and two gouges. Thirty-nine are Tecovas jasper,
17 Alibates flint, 14 Ogallala chert, seven Edwards flint , one
Dakota quartzite, and one moss agate.

60

Texas Archeological Society

The 72 scrapers are of six kinds : 30 end scrapers, 19 side
scrapers, eight flake scrapers, seven concave scrapers, five
disc scrapers, and three core scrapers. Thirty-six are Tecovas jasper, 15 Alibates flint, 12 Ogallala chert, seven Edwards flint , one Dakota quartzite, and one moss agate.
End scrapers (30; Pl. 9, a-e). These are flakes with the
dorsal face retouched across one end to form a rounded bit.
Sixteen are complete, seven are bit fragments , and seven
are butt fragments. The bit normally is at the opposite end
of the flake from the striking platform. Rather thin, slightly
elongated flakes usually were selected, but no particular
form was preferred, and shaping was confined to the bit,
although a few specimens have some retouching along one
or both edges. As a result, most of the end scrapers are
irregular in outline; only a few have the triangular outline
often shown by such artifacts. The few triangular specimens tend to have steeper bits than the others, most of
which have unusually low-angle bits. Thick-bitted and
keel-backed forms are not present. Signs of hafting, such
as constricted or smoothed edges, are lacking. The bits of
a few specimens show slight wear. The end scrapers range
in size from 29 x 24 x 27 to 64 x 42 x 10 mm.; most fall near
the middle of this range. Twelve are Tecovas jasper, nine
Alibates flint, six Edwards flint, and three Ogallala chert.
A voidance of coarse-textured stone for end scrapers is notable, and this may help explain the unusually high proportions of Alibates and Edwards flint in this artifact class.
Side scrapers (19; Pl. 9, f, g). These are flakes with the
dorsal face retouched along one side to form a scraping
edge. They are even less formalized and more variable
than the end scrapers. A few specimens are incomplete.
As a rule, the side scrapers are smaller and thicker than
normal for this type of artifact, with a steeper bit. A few
are thin, long, and narrow, but most are thick, short, and
broad. Outline is irregular ; any shaping is confined to the
scraping edge, which is usually convex but may be straight
or rounded. The scraping edges of a few specimens are
slightly worn. Size is from 37 x 28 x 8 to 73 x 63 x 17 mm.

Eleven are Tecovas jasper, five Ogallala chert, one Alibates
flint, one Edwards flint , and one moss agate. Dominance
of local materials for these comparatively amorphous side
scrapers is notable.
Flake scrapers (8) . These are small, unshaped flakes with
one edge partly retouched. Some may be fragments of end
or side scrapers. The retouching of a few may have resulted
from use. Six are Tecovas jasper, one Ogallala chert, and
one Alibates flint.
Concave scrapers (7; Pl. 9, h, i). These are small, unshaped flakes with a retouched concavity on one edge. The
widths and depths of the concavities show considerable
variation. Four are Tecovas jasper, two Alibates flint, and
one Dakota quartzite.
Disc scrapers (5; Pl. 9, j, k). These are circular to oval in
outline and plano-convex in cross section, shaped all or most
of the way around by chipping of the dorsal face. Size range
is limited: the smallest is 30 mm. across and 6 mm. thick;
the largest 42 x 12 mm. Three are Tecovas jasper, two
Alibates flint.
Core scrapers (3; Pl. 9, o, p) . These are fist-sized pebbles
with a flat face used as a striking platform for producing a
rounded scraping edge by percussion flaking. The flat face
is a natural fracture surface on two specimens, artificial on
one. Size ranges from 77 x 63 x 30 to 98 x 70 x 47 mm. All
are Ogallala chert.
Gravers (5; Pl. 9, l). These are small, thin, irregular
flakes with a more or less prominent, beak-like point produced by various degrees of retouching along one or both
edges. In most cases the points bear tiny flake scars possibly resulting from use. The gravers are much alike in
size; a typical specimen measures 41 x 24 x 8 mm. Three
are Tecovas jasper, two Alibates flint.
Gouges (2; Pl. 9, m). These are examples of the wellknown "Clear Fork gouge." With their flat ventral surface,
keeled dorsal surface, beveled bit, sharp corners, and straight

64

edges, they tend to be trapezoidal in both cross section and
outline, and sometimes are referred to appropriately as
"trapezoidal scrapers." They may have been used as chisels
or adzes as well as scrapers or gouges. Their general form
indicates hafting, and this inference is sometimes strengthened by the ground or worn appearance of their lateral
edges. The two specimens from the Little Sunday site, however, are not smoothed along the lateral edges, and do not
show the use-polish sometimes seen on the bit. They are
of similar size, 57 x 36 x 18 and 60 x 44 x 20 mm. Both are
Ogallala chert.
The 67 bifaces are of five kinds: 23 projectile points, 21
knives, 10 blades, eight choppers, and five drills. Thirtyfour are Tecovas jasper, 18 Ogallala chert, five Edwards
flint, three Alibates flint, three unidentified materials, two
Dakota quartzite, and two silicified wood. Alibates flint is
notably scarcer among the bifaces than among the unifaces.
The 23 projectile points are of six kinds: nine Ellis, seven
Refugio, three unidentifiable fragments, two Palmillas, one
Lange, and one Folsom point. Fourteen are Tecovas jasper,
four Edwards flint, two Alibates flint, one Ogallala chert,
one silicified wood, and one is unidentified material. All
are heavy enough to be considered dart points. Twelve of
the classifiable specimens are stemmed (Ellis, Palmillas,
and Lange points), eight are stemless (Refugio and Folsom
points). Only the Folsom point has ground edges. Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks estimate the ages of these point types,
except Folsom, at 4000 B.C. to 1000 A.D., and assign them
to various complexes of the Archaic Stage in Texas. The
Folsom type "had given way to other types by approximately 7000 B. C." (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, p. 426) and is assigned to the Paleo-American Stage.

Ellis points (9; Pl. 10, a-f) . Nine projectile points compare more closely with Ellis points than with any other
types described by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks. Although
more of them have the slightly concave bases of Lange
points (p. 436, Pl. 97) than the convex bases of Ellis points

Little Sunday: An Archaic Site in the Texas Panhandle

65

(pp. 420 and 422, Pl. 89), all of them fall below the size
range given for Lange points and within that for Ellis
points. All of the specimens are somewhat damaged, two
being merely shoulder fragments and one only a stem fragment. The smallest, probably resharpened, is 24 x 20 x 5
mm.; the largest, 44 x 29 x 5 mm. Minimum neck width,
possibly indicative of foreshaft diameter, ranges from 12
to 15 mm. Five are Tecovas jasper, three are Edwards flint
showing some patination, and one is silicified wood. The
cultural affiliations of Ellis points are described as "Widely
distributed in Archaic Stage, more or less throughout Texas
except for Southwest section and probably the upper Panhandle. Never numerous in any particular area but may
be of greatest relative frequency in East Texas Aspect"
(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, pp. 420, 422). Their age is estimated as "1000 B.C. or earlier to 500 or 1000 A.D."
Refugio points (7; Pl. 10, g-m). Seven projectile points
fall within the Refugio type as defined by Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks (p. 474, Pl. 117), except that all are below the
minimum size. If this situation is found repeatedly in this
and adjoining areas, it may become advisable to modify
the definition of Refugio points by lowering the minimum
size to include smaller specimens, or to establish a separate
type for them. Three are complete, two are tipless, and two
are basal fragments. Workmanship tends to be somewhat
cruder than that of the stemmed points. Some of the Refugio
points may be small knives or blanks rather than projectile
points, but most are too narrow to be blanks. Size varies
little ; the smallest measurable specimen is 45 x 18 x 5 mm.,
the largest 51 x 22 x 8 mm. The former specimen, composed
of an unidentified, translucent, speckled, light gray flint,
is somewhat aberrant in having slight notches at the basal
corners (Pl. 10, m) . Of the remaining specimens, five are
Tecovas jasper , one Alibates flint . Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks
(p. 474) give the cultural affiliations of Refugio points as
"A minor type in various Archaic complexes," and the
estimated age as "Possibly 2000 B.C. to 1000 A.D."

66

Texas Archeological Society

Unclassifiable projectile point fragments (3) . These tip
fragments are small enough to suggest projectile points
rather than knives, and wide enough to suggest one or
more of the stemmed types rather than the stemless Refugio
type. Two are Tecovas jasper and one is Edwards flint.
Palmillas points (2 ; Pl. 10, n). Two projectile points correspond in all features to Palmillas points as described by
Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (p. 462, Pl. 110) . One tipless specimen of Tecovas jasper is 50 x 22 x 8 mm.; a larger, complete
specimen of similar material disappeared from the collection before it could be measured or photographed. Cultural
affiliations and estimated age of Palmillas points are given
(ibid.) as "A minor type in most complexes of Archaic
Stage in various parts of Texas" and "Probably within the
Christian era."
Lange point (1; Pl. 10, o). A single badly damaged projectile point of Ogallala chert compares favorably in all
respects with Lange points as defined by Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks (p. 436, Pl. 97). Although the original length
and width of this specimen cannot be accurately estimated,
it is considerably larger than the Ellis points. Cultural
affiliations and estimated age of Lange points are given
(ibid.) as "Primarily Edwards Plateau Aspect, extending
into East Texas Aspect, Aransas Focus on coast, and towards
plains below Panhandle" and "About 4000 B.C. to 1000 A.D.
or greater part thereof."
Folsom point (1) . The forward half of a Folsom point,
made of Alibates flint and fluted on both faces nearly t o
the tip, was found at the Little Sunday site. Grinding of
the lateral edges extends slightly past the break. The fragment is 20 mm. wide and 4 mm. thick; its original length
cannot be accurately determined. If Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks are correct in estimating that Folsom points disappeared about 7000 B.C. and that Lange points appeared
about 4000 B.C., then these artifacts are separated b y a gap
in time of about 3000 years, and it must be concluded either
that this camp site was known to Paleo-American as well

as Archaic people, or-more probably-that the Folsom
point was picked up elsewhere and brought into camp by
the makers of the Archaic points. The possibility remains,
however, that the age estimates are inaccurate, and that
there is an overlap in time between Paleo-American and
Archaic points such as the Folsom and Lange types. This
possibility receives some support from the frequent association of various Paleo-American and Archaic point types
on camp sites of the Panhandle and elsewhere, and poses
an important problem to be investigated, as Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks point out on pp. 104-106.
Twenty-one biface artifacts of simple outline, distinguished from stemless projectile points by wideness and greater
size, and from blades by thinness and better flaking, are
classified as knives. Some of these artifacts may be blanks,
especially the small specimens. The knives are of three
kinds: 18 unclassifiable fragments, two triangular, and one
lanceolate. The high proportion of fragmentary specimens
suggests either hard use of finished artifacts for cutting
purposes or accidental breakage of unfinished artifacts in
the manufacturing process. Nine are Tecovas jasper, seven
Ogallala chert, two Dakota quartzite, one Alibates flint,
one Edwards flint, and one silicified wood. The high proportion of coarser materials among these larger artifacts
is noteworthy.

Unclassifiable knife fragments (18). Eight of these are
corners, seven are tips, two are midsections, and one is an
edge fragment. They suggest a wide size range for the
original artifacts. The corner fragments are square to rounded, indicating triangular to oval outlines. Eight are Tecovas
jasper, five Ogallala chert, two Dakota quartzite, one Alibates flint, one Edwards flint, and one silicified wood.
Triangular knives (2; Pl. 10, p, q). These have straight
bases, square corners, and convex edges. The smaller specimen is complete, Tecovas jasper, and 47 x 32 x 9 mm.; the
larger is a base fragment , Ogallala chert, and ? x 47 x 7

mm.

-=------

Lanceolate knife (1). This tipless specimen has roughly
parallel edges and a convex base. It is Ogallala chert, ? x 31
x 9 mm.
Blades (10; Pl. 10, r-t). These biface artifacts are round
to triangular in outline, thick and crudely flaked. Some
may be blanks or rejects. Six are complete and four are
base, corner, or edge fragments. The smallest measurable
specimen is 42 x 42 x 21 mm., the largest 85 x 60 x 22 mm.
The less complete specimens indicate original artifacts falling within this size range. Seven are Tecovas jasper, two
Ogallala chert, and one (the largest and best made blade,
Pl. 10, r) is greenish-gray phyllite or slate of uncertain
origin.
Choppers and hammers (8; Pl. 10, v, w). These fist-sized
pebbles show chipping and battering around part or all
of their circumference. All are the tough Ogallala chert,
which was readily available in smooth chunks of convenient
size and shape for choppers and hammers. The chipping of
most was intentional; in a few it may have resulted from
use. One or two of the heaviest specimens show extensive
battering without significant chipping.
Drills include two key-shaped specimens, two unclassifiable fragments, and one reworked from a knife. All are
Tecovas jasper except one of unidentified material.

Key-shaped drills (2; Pl. 10, u). These are similar in shape
and size, with expanded, rounded bases 24 and 25 mm. wide,
respectively. Their original lengths cannot be estimated.
Unclassifiable drill fragments (2). A tip fragment of a
large drill measures 44 x 14 x 8 mm. A midsection of a still
larger drill measures 21 x 15 x 9 mm. The latter specimen
is burned so that the material is indeterminate.
Reworked knife drill (1). This is a badly broken specimen
of what appears to have been a knife reworked into a drill;
it is a midsection, with both drill tip and knife base missing.
The knife was 34 mm. wide and 7 mm. thick.

of grinding implements, seven reprepresent milling stones. All except
a micaceous, fine-grained, gray to
nearby outcrops of the Trujillo forA few show some lime encrustation.

Manos (7). Three of these are halves, two are edge fragments, and two are central fragments. The halves indicate
manos of sub-rectangular outline with partly shaped edges.
One half fragment has both faces worn and pecked-one
flat, the other transversely convex. It is 100 mm. wide and
41 mm. thick, with maximum thickness along one side. A
second half fragment has one face worn flat, the other
slightly worn and transversely convex. It is 100 mm. wide
and 29 mm. thick, again with maximum thickness along one
side. A third half fragment has one face worn flat, the other
unworked. It is 102 mm. wide and 43 mm. thick; this time
with maximum thickness down the middle. The uniformity
of width among these three mana halves is worth noting.
The two edge fragments show shaped edges. One edge
fragment 24 mm. thick has one face worn flat and pecked,
the other unworked. A second edge fragment 26 mm. thick
has one face worn flat, the other unworked. One central
fragment is 23 mm. thick with one face worn flat, the other
unworked; a second central fragment, hardly more than a
chip, is composed of local quartzite and retains part of one
worn flat face.
Milling stones (5). Three of these are central fragments
and two are edge fragments. The largest central fragment ,
27 mm. thick, has one worn and pecked slightly concave
face; the other is unworked. The other two central fragments are quite thin, evidently as a result of splitting; one
has a worn flat face, and the other has a worn slightly
concave face. Both of the edge fragments show edges pecked
into shape. The larger edge fragment has one worn and
pecked concave face, the other unworked. It is large enough
to indicate an oval basin some 10 mm. deep and 130 mm.
wide. The maximum thickness of 35 mm. occurs near the
edge. The milling surface is sooty. The smaller edge frag-

72

ment has one worn and pecked slightly concave face, t he
other unworked. It has a maximum thickness, also near the
edge, of 30 mm .

Shell pendant fragments (2 ; Pl. 9, n). These pieces of
worked conch shell evidently represent a single large pendant, although they do not match. The larger fragment retains part of an inner hole as well as the outer edge. If th e
pendant had a central perforation and a circular outline,
as indicated by approximately parallel arcs of hole and
edge, it may have had a diameter of about 90 mm. The
smaller fragment retains only part of the outer edge. Both
pieces are smooth and plain.
CONCLUSIONS
Surface examinations of the Little Sunday site have produced sufficient data and artifacts to make possible a start
at defining the archeological complex represented at the
site. Except for the fact that similar features have been
observed and similar artifacts collected at many comparable
localities along the eastern Caprock Escarpment, nothing
is known as yet about the geographic distribution of the
complex. What is now known of the cultural content, cultural affiliations, and chronological position of the complex
may be summarized as follows:
The making of open camps on canyon rims, and the use
of hearth rocks and pebbles for "stone boiling," are shown
by the position of the site and the kinds of features observed.
The shapes and sizes of the fireplaces remain to be determined by excavation. Nothing is yet known about structures,
if any, or burials. An emphasis on hunting supplemented
by gathering is indicated by the abundance of dart points,
hide scrapers, and choppers, accompanied by milling stones.
The Twilla bison kill in the southeastern part of the Panhandle may represent this or a similar Archaic complex
(Tunnell and Hughes, 1955) . Among artifact types which,
t aken together and with the above traits, might be expected
to have some diagnostic value in identifying the complex
when it is found elsewher e, the following are especially

Little Stmday: An Archaic Site in the Texas Panhandle

73

noteworthy: dominance of Ellis and Refugio points, accompanied by other Archaic point types in minor amounts,
and perhaps rarely by Paleo-American point types; plain
knives represented by numerous fragments; many crude
blades and heavy choppers; some key-shaped drills; abundant end scrapers, usually large, thin, and unworked except
across the rounded bit; many side scrapers, usually small,
thick, and unworked except along the scraping edge; some
concave scrapers; a few disc scrapers and gravers; occasional heavy core scrapers and Clear Fork gouges; a number
of milling stones with oval basins and edges shaped by
pecking; and manos of sub-rectangular outline.
That the inhabitants of the Little Sunday site were residents of the region is shown by the preponderance of local
materials used for these artifacts. Materials of some chippedstone artifacts imported from the north, southeast, and west,
however, indicate some roaming or trading in those directions, and fragments of conch shell indicate some remote,
though probably indirect connections with the Gulf coast.
Certain of the artifacts, such as dart-point types and Clear
Fork gouges, suggest southeasterly connections, although
in a general way the complex also resembles the few others
of comparable age that have been defined in the Plains to
the north and the Rockies to the west.
The indications of age provided by the physical features
of the site are supported by the general character of its
cultural remains, in particular by the dart-point types and
the Clear Fork gouges, whose antiquity has been recognized.
Ages of the two dominant point forms have been estimated
from 2000 B.C. to 1000 A.D., and it may be assumed that
the age of the site falls somewhere within this range, until
excavation has provided evidence for more precise dating.
These dates and the character of the complex serve to place
the component within the time-culture unit referred to by
Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) as the Archaic Stage,
which appears to be equivalent to the period that has been

74

Texas Archeological Society

known in the Plains as Intermediate or Middle Prehistoric.1
Although it would be unreliable by itself, negative evidence-the absence of traits generally late in this region,
such as pottery, arrowpoints, double-pointed alternate-beveled knives, and obsidian-also indicates the antiquity of
the Little Sunday site.
Excavation of this site and further investigation of many
similar sites in the Panhandle promise full cultural, temporal, and spatial definition, eventually, of the Little Sunday and other Archaic complexes of this region. Aside from
assembling of evidence, the main problem will be that of
dividing into meaningful units a history of long, slow culture
change recorded only in features and artifacts of few types
and unspecialized forms. This problem is one in which analyses of frequencies and associations of types will be of far
more value than mere presence-absence determinations;
hence the emphasis on quantification in this report.

SCOTTSBLUFF POINTS IN THE OBSHNER
SITE NEAR DALLAS, TEXAS
WILSON w. CROOK, JR., AND R. K. HARRIS
The presence of certain projectile-point types, normally
considered as distinctive of Early Man sites on the High
Plains, in association with cultures of the non-pottery Archaic stage has become increasingly more common as the
study of these "intermediate" groups has progressed in
recent years in North America. (Many authorities object
to the term "Archaic," but until a better name is applied
it will be used in this paper).
These projectile points, whatever the cause of their occurrence in such associations, are most commonly of certain
specific types in a given area. For example, in Central
Texas, many Edwards Plateau Aspect associations seem to
carry a sprinkling of Angostura points, Plainview points,
and other types which appear related to "pure" Early Man
complexes elsewhere. In Northeast Texas, the Plainview
and Plainview-like points abound in Trinity Aspect Archaic
sites along the Upper Trinity River; Meserve points occur
sparsely along the Upper Trinity but heavily along the Red
River, especially in Lamar County, Texas; and a form of
Clovis point is often to be found in East Texas, particularly
along the upper reaches of the Sabine and Sulphur Rivers,
nearly always with Archaic material.
Scottsbluff projectile points are rare enough in Texas anywhere, including the High Plains region where so many
Early Man sites occur, and there has been archeological
curiosity concerning the sporadic finding of Scottsbluff
points in some numbers in Northwest Louisiana and the
adjacent border counties of Northeast Texas. Since such
specimens inevitably occurred in private collections with
no source recorded, or were found as seemingly unconnected
individual occurrences, nothing has been known of their
geologic or archeologic provenience in this region.
Therefore, the discovery of two bona fide Scottsbluff
points, one in place and the other essentially so for all prac-

76

tical purposes, in unquestionable association with a Carrollton focus complex in a site near Seagoville, Dallas, County,
Texas, has been of considerable interest. The recording of
this find is the purpose of this article. That a reworked
Clovis (?) point also occurred in place, and a Meserve-like
point apparently reworked from a large Plainview was
found essentially in place, heightens interest in the locality.
THE LOUIS OBSHNER SITE
Just south of Seagoville, Texas (Figs. 2, 3), the Louis
Obshner site (27A6-13) lies in the Union Terminal-Carrollton (T-1) terrace at an elevation of some 40 feet above the
present-day flood-plain (T-0 terrace). The site is a buried
one. No artifacts are observed upon the surface, and all
cultural debris is exposed by extensive gully erosion and
digging.
Without question, the site is a Carrollton focus component, as at least one specimen of every known Carrollton
focus trait has been recovered to date, with the sole exception of drills made from repainted broken dart points.
Only one object not commonly associated with the Carrollton focus has been found here (a single quartz crystal
to be discussed later) , and there is no evidence whatsoever
of any other cultural component being present at the site.
Until recently, the site was not distinguished by any particular abnormality other than extensive cultural debris eroded
from the sides of the gully system, the fact that it appeared
to be an early-phase Carrollton site occurring exclusively
in the Albritton clay formation, and that its surface was on
the contact line with the overlying Pattillo sand.
In May, 1954, the Dallas Archeological Society conducted
its annual group dig at the site, sinking some 16 test pits
in an effort to explore what seemed to be an important
Carrollton focus Archaic site. This test-pitting was a remarkable stroke of good fortune in light of the subsequent
discovery and excavation of a Scottsbluff point in place
nearly adjacent to two of the recorded test pits from the
dig, both of which yielded artifacts in undisturbed cultural

zones of identical depth and provenience. A large reworked
Plainview point, with ground base and basal edges, which
is considered as having been essentially in place, also was
adjacent to the same two pits. A Scottsbluff point not in
place, but likewise considered essentially so, was immediately adjacent to another test pit which-while it yielded
no artifacts-definitely located the cultural zone in the area
by the number of flakes and debris encountered at specific
levels, and their total absence in the overlying Pattillo formation at this spot. A reworked fluted Clovis point found
in place was not near any of the test pits, but occurred at
a comparable depth in the same geologic formation from
which the test pits produced cultural material. Both of the
Scottsbluff points and the reworked Clovis and Plainview
points were exposed by the continuing erosion of gully
walls, and the test pit material confirms the apparent
provenience of these specimens.
A good percentage of all artifacts from the Obshner site
have been found in situ in the gully walls, and these plus
the materials excavated in the test pits have given a clear
picture of the occurrence of the cultural level. Without exception, no artifact has been found to occur above the Albritton-Pattillo contact line. Artifacts; flint and quartzite
chips, flakes , and broken cores and cobbles; hearth stones;
clay "blobs"; and flecks of charcoal, occur in the topmost
two-thirds of the red sandy Albritton formation clay. These
evidences seem to reach their culmination at the surface
of the Albritton clay, but do not seem present whatsoever
in the succeeding Pattillo sand formation. In this respect
the site appears comparable with the Bachman's Dam site
of Carrollton focus affiliation which yielded such an excellent basal half of a Plainview point, and a questionable
Eden stem fragment.
Only where natural erosion processes or artificial digging (by archeological test pits and nearby gravel operations) have exposed the Albritton clay, do artifacts and
debris occur. Thus it is rather safe to observe that human
occupation of the site began sometime after the commence-

ment of the Albritton formation deposition, increased in intensity as the formation continued to be built up, until it
reached a climax upon the final surface of the Albrittononly to be abandoned before the succeeding Pattillo formation deposition began.
ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGES,
In all, 63 dart points, three projectile-point blanks, eight
Clear Fork gouges, two finely-chipped gravers, four flake
scrapers, two crude "Waco net-sinkers," four Carrollton axes
of the single-bitted type (Crook and Harris, 1954b), 10 large
side-scrapers, 12 large knife blades, a number of clay "blobs,"
a part of a large "eared" projectile point, and a single quartz
crystal have come irom the site. These duplicate almost
precisely in classes, proportions, and techniques, all of the
trait items defined for the Carrollton focus, with the exception of the absence as yet of drills made from repainted
broken dart points, and the presence of the one exotic
quartz crystal. Even the percentages of flint-quartzite-petrified wood in the projectile points almost exactly match
those of the Wheeler and Lake Dallas type sites for Carrollton focus (Crook and Harris, 1952, 1954a, 1954b; Crook
1952) . Likewise, the percentages of occurrence of earlyprojectile point forms, points with ground edges on the
bases and stems, and those with beveled or " twisted" blades,
seem almost identical.
Of the total assemblage, fortunately , 11 proj ectile points,
five gouges, one net-sinker, four blades, one flake scraper,
and one side scraper have been recovered in situ either in
the gully walls or in test pits. In addition, a large number of
flakes, cobbles and cores, hearth stones, and charcoal flecks
have likewise been observed in situ. Two more projectile

points can almost be classed as being in place due to the
nature of their finding.
At Location "A", in the sheer wall of the main gravel pit
(Fig. 3), the mid-section of a broken dart point of a Carrollton focus type (Plate 13, No. 1) was literally hacked
out of the tough Albritton clay at a depth of 24 inches below the Albritton-Pattillo contact line. The Albritton formation here is some 36 inches in thickness.
A hearth of burned stones occurred at a depth of 24 inches
in the Albritton formation at Location "B", exposed in the
eroded wall of a small gravel pit (Fig. 3). Firmly imbedded
in the tough red Albritton clay, amongst the actual hearth
stones at this location, was another broken projectile point
of a Carrollton focus type with ground stem edges (Plate
13, No. 2). Just south of the hearth, at a depth of 9Yz inches
below the Albritton surface, was a broken blade in situ; and
a few feet north of the hearth, a broken projectile point at
a depth of 9 inches below the Albritton surface (Plate 13,
No. 3). Here, too, the Albritton formation is about 36 inches
in total thickness.
Location "C" (Fig. 3) has been the most prolific producer
of artifacts in situ. Here, in the deep side-arm of the main
gully system, four complete Carrollton focus dart points,
two of which have ground stems, have been removed from
the gully walls (Plate 13, Nos. 4-7) at depths of 14, 12, 12,
and 12 inches respectively, in the Albritton clay. AdditionPLATE 11

ally, one gouge was found in place at a depth of 11 inches
in the Albritton clay at this location, and a broken one 15
inches deep; a third gouge occurred one inch deep in the
Albritton, just below the Pattillo contact. A broken twothirds of a knife blade was again literally hacked from the
tough Albritton clay at a depth of 27 inches (Plate 14,
Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6). Unpictured is a crude net-sinker from 11
inches deep. The Albritton exhibits a 30 inch thickness at
this location.
Innumerable cobbles, broken cores, and flakes . .. to say
nothing of charcoal specks ... have been observed in place
in the gully walls at Location "C", at depths varying from
practically at the surface of the Albritton formation to as
deep as 20 inches within it.
This extremely prolific Location "C" also has a large
amount of slope-wash debris of chips, flakes, cores, etc.,
where erosion has removed the Albritton clay. This "rich
spot" has been especially watched on nearly every weekend collecting trip for several years. It had been carefully
searched by the authors on one weekend in 1953. Heavy
local rains then fell, and on the following weekend a projectile point (Plate 13, No. 12) was discovered freshly
washed out of the Albritton clay slope. This appears to
have been originally either a Clovis point or a large variant
of the Plainview type which was broken and subsequently
given a new tip. It was unquestionably derived from the
Albritton formation, as-at the position of discovery-no
remnant of the Pattillo formation remains today on the
gully lip above, and the probable original position of the
find had been carefully scrutinized the preceding week before the rains. Hence this specimen is also treated as essentially in situ. Based upon its discovery position, it must
have come from the uppermost 12 inches of the Albritton
formation.
The knowledge of this "rich spot" prompted its selection
as the site of the annual group dig of the Dallas Archeological Society in May, 1954. While the chain of test pits was

84

Texas Archeological SoCiet.;:.y_ _ _ _ __ __

designed to transect the terrace surface from the river side
across the gully system, two pits (Fig. 3, Nos. 4 and 8) were
located on the promontory between the gully arms at Location "C". In Test Pit 4, a gouge was excavated at a depth
of 8 inches in the Albritton, a flake-scraper also at 8 inches,
and a large side-scraper at a depth of 11 inches; these were
in addition to numerous flakes, cores, and charcoal flecks
down to 17 inches in the Albritton (Plate 13, Nos. 9 and 10;
Plate 14, No. 2). In Test Pit 8, two knife blades were excavated at respective depths of 7 and 10 inches in the Albritton. At both test pit locations, the Pattillo sand formation
remained only as a sloped-off thickness of some three inches
above the Albritton contact line, totally disappearing in a
few more feet at the present edges of the gullies.

In June, 1955, another Carrollton focus dart point was discovered in place in the wall of a small gravel test at Location "E" (Fig. 2). This point (Plate 13, No. 8) was exposed
11 inches below the Albritton surface in the exposed wall
of the pit; the surface Pattillo sands exhi bit an 8-inch thickness in this pit, while the underlying Albritton clays are
some 30 inches in depth.
Also in June of 1955, the second Scottsbluff point was
found at Location "F" (Fig. 2) , lying in a small erosion
gully. This point had been apparently weathered out by
heavy rains occurring two days previous to the find, and
was not exposed the preceding week when the authors
specifically searched this spot due to the large numbers of
flakes and other debris beginning to show at this point of
fresh erosion. Cattle grazing on the site had been using
this new, incipient gully as a trail; their footprints were
freshly preserved in the gully at the time the Scottsbluff
point was found, as though having been made after the pre-

viously-mentioned heavy rains which rendered the gully
materials soft. The point when found was freshly broken
in two parts which fit together perfectly (Plate 12, Nos.
2, 2a). The flint surface had been heavily patina ted in a
sharply contrasting color to the exposed interior of the
fresh breaks. There seems little question that the point
eroded out during the heavy rains five days after the authors had searched the spot, and that a cow stepped upon
the exposed point, breaking it, shortly after the rains in
the two days before the discovery.
Adjacent to this particular gully, Test Pit 6 was dug on
the occasion of the Dallas Society's group dig. As revealed
by the records of this pit, the surface Pattillo sand is present
as a 6-inch layer, underlain by 30 inches of Albritton red
clays. No chips or materials of human origin whatsoever
were encountered in Test Pit 6 in the Pattillo, yet a number
were found in the Albritton to depths of 12 inches below
its surface. Since the Scottsbluff point's position as found
was but 20 inches below the top of the Albritton in the
gully, it seems rather conclusive that this particular specimen was derived from a former position in the upper 12
inches of the Albritton in this gully. Thus it is also treated
as "essentially" in situ for the purposes of association.
At Location "G" (Fig. 3), in July of 1955, the bare edge
of a projectile point was found protruding from the sharp
gully bank at a depth of 14Y2 inches below the Albritton
surface, following more heavy rains. Upon excavation
(Plate 11, D, F), this point proved to be of the Clovis fluted
type, with a blunt, seemingly re-chipped tip. The basal
fluting is an inch long on each side and the edges are
ground for a comparable length (Plate 13, No. 11) . At this
location the surface Pattillo sand is some four inches thick
and well-marked; the underlying Albritton clay is approximately 30 inches thick.
THE SCOTTSBLUFF POINTS
So far, only the second Scottsbluff point has been discussed. The first one was found as follows: On Wednesday,

88

Texas Archeological Society

January 5, 1955, Harris celebrated a day off from work by
visiting the "rich spot" at the Obshner site. There, freshly
exposed in the gully wall at Location "C", he observed a
few millimeters of a flint projectile-point base protruding at
a depth of some 8 inches below th e Albritton formation surface. After careful, partial excavation with a hand-trowel,
he exposed enough of the stem and shoulder to arouse his
suspicions that the point was a Scottsbluff, at which time
he left and telephoned Crook to "come quick" with camera
and equipment to verify what might be a momentous find .
Together, the authors completed the exposure of the projectile point, finding it to be truly a Scottsbluff point (Plate
12, Nos. 1, 1-A). The find was a particularly happy event
in that it occurred unmistakably in situ. Over 80 per cent
of its total length projected inward into the gully wall,
itself a sheer erosional face of very dense clay. It was
within a very few inches of the previous occurrence of some _
four projectile points of Carrollton focus types and two
gouges in the gJ.llly face, apparently sandwiched horizontally betw~en these and the edge of Test Pit 4. The test pit
had approached the same gully wall within 24 inches. The
stakes in Plate 11, A mark the location of Test Pits 4 and 8,
showing their proximity to the Scottsbluff find.
Not only did the gully wall, when excavated to remove
the Scottsbluff point, reveal a knife blade at the same level
and chips, flakes, cores, and charcoal flecks both above and
below (Plate 11, B, C), but all these objects were between
the Albritton surface and a maximum depth of 20 inches
into this formation. The records of previous finds in situ in
the same gully wall and closely adjacent test pits showed
artifact occurrence at the same levels and deeper, yet all
unquestionably of Carrollton focus derivation. No question
could thus remain about the association of the first Scottsbluff point and the accompanying Carrollton focus material.
The Scottsbluff point lay flat , with the upper surface
rather well patinated (Plate 12, No. 1) , while the under
side mainly retained its original honey color (Plate 12,

No. 1A). This strongly suggests that the point actually became patinated in place, suggesting some antiquity for the
discovery position. Admittedly, had the point patinated
elsewhere and later been acquired and dropped at the
finding location, the odds are 50-50 as to its fall upon the
then-surface, but a later find of a white flint blade, which
when broken, showed a heavily-patinated surface on both
sides, with "honey" flint in the center, somewhat supports
the theory of patination- in - place. True, this particular
"honey" flint is known to patinate "quickly", but to have
done so prior to the completion of the Albritton depositionto say nothing of its subsequent and permanent burial until
today by the overlying Patillo formation-suggests a considerable lapse of time.
The second Scottsbluff point (Plate 12, Nos. 2, 2A), considered as essentially in place, is more heavily patinated,
even, than the first. This is excellently demonstrated in the
fresh break attributed to a cow stepping upon it wherein
the interior displays the original color of the flint-almost
blue-black in striking contrast to the dull creamy tan of
the surface. One side is again more altered than the other,
but in this specimen both sides are quite well patinated.
As we do not know the position in which it lay prior to
eroding out, no inferences may be drawn.
The excavated Scottsbluff point is 98 mm. long, 25 mm.
wide at its widest part, and 7 mm. thick at its thickest
section. The second Scottsbluff point is 104 mm. long, 27
mm. wide, and 9 mm. thick. Their shape and apparent degree of patination compare most favorably with the specimens shown in Moss (1951, Plate I , Nos. 4 and 5 from left
in upper panel), and with Type B in the lower panel of the
same publication, reprinted from Howard and Hack (1943).
The two Obshner specimens fall in the range of the Scottsbluff type recovered from the Finley site at Eden, Wyoming,
and would be indistinguishable if placed among the larger
specimens from this famous locality.
Neither the seemingly reworked Clovis point nor the

92

Texas Archeological Society

reworked Plainview point show s any detectable patina, due
possibly to their being light-colored flints which may not
patinate readily or show it to the eye. Most of the Carrollton focus points from the site are also of light-colored flint
or quartzite (which seemingly does not patinate) and do
not show any alteration, although one (Plate 13, No. 5)
appears to carry a light film of patina, especially on both
sides of the proximinal blade end.
GEOLOGY OF THE OBSHNER SITE
The section of the Union Terminal-Carrollton (T-1) terrace at the Obshner site is perfectly typical of the Upper
Trinity system-a basal Hill gravel; next, the Lower Shuler
laminated yellow sands ; then the Upper Shuler yellow
sandy clay with included caliche nodules; a strong erosional
break; the Albritton red sandy clay; and finally the Pattillo
grey sands at the surface.
The only remarkable feature is the evidence of a gullyerosion sequence at the Obshner arch eological site which can
best be explained by a theoretical sequence of springs and
their consequent secondary erosion and deposition.
At present, the archeological site is concentrated along
a marked gully system which lies somewhat back from the
T-1 terrace drop-off relief above the Floodplain. This is in
general contrast to the known common occurrence of Trinity Aspect sites being located on terrace T-1 near where a
tributary stream (either present or extinct) cuts through
it to reach the present valley . Site materials do sparsely
occur on the eroded and exposed slopes of terrace T-1 , but
are mainly concentrated along the gullies which are cut into
these slopes.
Today the artifact-bearing gully is a dry wash. Immediately to the north, and joining the dry wash before its entrance into the valley below, is a present-day minor channel
which has its origin in a spring-seep considerably upgr ade
from the site.

It is obvious fr om an examin ation of the site's gully
walls that the presen t dry wash-along which the site is
concentrated-is a r esult of r elatively recent erosion which
h as re-cut the soft, secondary fill of a former gully. Thus,
for convenience, w e shall r efer to the older on e as gully
No. 1 and the presen t one as gully No. 2.

In recapitulation of the geological chronology of th e site,
the Trinity River cut deeply into its valley to establish
terrace T-2; then the successive depositions of Hill gravels,
Lower Shuler laminated yellow sands , and Upper Shuler
yellow clays with caliche-each separated fr om the other
by a minor erosional surface-built up a floodplain which
is essentially the basis for the present T-1. Then, a major
erosion occurred, during which the Trinity retrenched its
valley, established the T-1 relief, and created gully No. 1
. . . apparently a somewhat shallow, wide ''draw" which
may well have been the result of seepage springs at this
formerly-high ground-water level. Certain evidences, such
as the development of a thin ironstone crust over a seeming
erosional surface as exposed today in the gully just above
the site, suggest such a condition at the close of Upper
Shuler times, corresponding to the first gully erosion to
be observed.
Deposition of the red sandy Albritton clays then began,
eventually almost choking gully No. 1. During this period
the occupation of the Obshner site began along the gully
sides, perhaps along the edges of a spring branch, near
where its head was then. This Albritton deposition almost
filled gully No. 1, and the human occupation culminated
upon its surface, still adjacent to what must have been a
spring-branch. This is the most logical explanation of the
development of a "draw" of such length, though actual terrace-erosion gullies of shorter length and deeper penetration might have occurred on the actual terrace slopes.
A period of stabilization or halt then ensued, durin g which
the Albritton formation was slightly sloped-off and the
human occupation ceased.

96

T exas ArcheoLogica L S ociet y

Again renewed deposition by the Trinity Riv er laid d own ,
at this particular locality, a thin covering of Pattillo sa nd
over the slopes of the T-1 terrace and the nearly-filled
"draw", covering the former human occupation surface and
almost totally eliminating the gradient of the "draw".
Since this time the remaining relief of T-1 has been cut,
the Carter formation deposited in the floodplain , and today's Trinity channel developed. Up on the terrace at the
Obshner site, gully No. 2 has been cut, stabilized, and a very
recent renewed gully-cutting initiated.
From the archeological evidence afforded above, it is obvious that the human occupation began relatively early in
the filling of gully No. 1 by the Albritton formati on . This
occupation continued with increasing concentration until
the completion of the deposition of the Albritton clay, and
for an undetermined time thereafter, upon its surface. However, before the deposition of Pattillo sands further obliterated gully No. 1, th e occupation had apparently ceased.
Should the authors' current theory concerning sea-levelaffected Gulf Coast stream systems be valid, then the several depositions of the Trinity (and other nearby streams
physically removed from the direct influence of the continental and alpine glaciers) represent waning-retreat periods of the Wisconsin-Recent glaciations. Hence the Albritton formation possibly represents the deposition connected with the waning-retreat of the W/4 or Mankato,
certainly in any case the early Post-Glacial period. Invoking the reasoning based upon available radiocarbon dates,
deposition of the Albritton formation must have taken place
some time later than 7,500 B. C.
It is indeed unfortunate that the red sandy clays of the
Albritton formation have apparently been so unfriendly to
the preservation of bone material everywhere along the
Trinity, allowing absolutely no paleontological check upon
possible geologic assignments. To date no fragments of
bone larger than one's thumbnail have been recovered in
the formation , hence identifications have been impossible.

Absolutely nothing is known of the fauna present in the
area during this period, yet from the numbers of projectile
points and scrapers recovered in place, hunting of some
fashion must have been important. At the Milton site, between Obshner and Dallas, the much-battered distal end of
what seems to be a proboscidean leg bone was recovered
in place in the basal 6 inches of the Albritton; its uniqueness to date and very location at the base of the Albritton
renders this specimen highly suspect as a wash-in from the
underlying Upper Shuler which has yielded semi-articulated
skeletons of Elephas columbi.
The overlying Pattillo grey sands have been little better
in providing faunal identifications with archeological sites.
Two partial human skulls of a long-headed, keel-vaulted
type, plus fragmentary human leg bones, several bison
teeth, a possible horse tooth, and fragments of antler complete the meager list of finds . The human remains are not
as yet distinctive of geologic periods; the bison teeth while
as large as specimens collected from B. taylori horizons at
Clovis, Lubbock, and Plainview, and larger than those found
in recent pottery-bearing sites of the region, are not considered definitive of species by expert paleontologists; the
horse tooth is a single occurrence, not worthy of large-scale
deductions and assignments; and the antler fragments are
not identifiable as to species.
Pursuing this geologic supposition, however, logic dictates that the Obshner site was occupied by the Carrollton
focus from late in the early Post-Glacial to approximately
middle Post-Glacial times. If this is tenable, the Scottsbluff
point and reworked Clovis point found in place would date
from about 5,500 B. C., entirely in accord with the known
radiocarbon dates for Scottsbluff and mixed Eden-Scottsbluff sites on the High Plains.
While it is a truism that an archeological site is dated by
the latest object present, in this particular problem as yet
no radio-carbon date has been produced to demonstrate how
late the beginning of Carrollton focus actually was, nor, for

98

Texas Archeological Society

that matter, the beginning date for any other Archaic complex in Texas. In addition, no one has yet ventured a real
explanation of the in situ mixture of Scottsbluff, Clovis,
Folsom, and Archaic-type projectile points with extinct
fauna at the Berclair Terrace site in Bee County, Texas.
CONCLUSIONS AND COMPARISONS
An explanation for the presence of Scottsbluff points at
the Obshner site is patently demanded (as well as for the
Scottsbluff specimens found in Northwest Louisiana and
East Texas), and several conclusions can be reached. (A)
The points were "pick-ups" from an earlier site in the
vicinity, though no such site has been discovered yet in
this region; or (B) the points were a result of trade contact
and/or cultural overlap at a later date in the area when
both cultures were present.
The latter explanation seems most feasible in light of the
possible geologic interpretations, the remarkable "coincidence" of the continuing finds of "Early" points in association with Archaic sites, and the as-yet-unexplained occurrence of considerable numbers of Scottsbluff points in
Northwest Louisiana and adjacent East Texas on upland
sites with undetermined provenience (Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks, 1954, pp. 146-147).
Northwest Louisiana and adjacent East Texas also have
yielded a number of occurrences of Clovis and Clovis-like
points. Their apparent presence at Obshner, along with
Scottsbluff points, plus the unmistakable Clovis point from
the Carrollton focus site at Melaun in Dallas County, does
not therefore seem an archeological peculiarity. Explanations of the occurrences present a very definite difficulty,
though perhaps magnified by the established associations
on the High Plains.
While not necessarily relevant to the problem at Obshner,
stemmed projectile points of essentially Archaic types have
been found in the lowest levels of a rock shelter in Southem Illinois, dated by radio-carbon as early as 8,800 B. C.

ScottsbLuff Points in the Obshner Site Near DaLLas, Texas

99

Stemmed ''Archaic" points have also been found in Missouri
and Indiana, possibly associated with remains of Mastodon
americanus (Gross, 1951). Since certain High Plains "Yuma"
sites have been dated by radiocarbon as late as 4,800 B. C. ,
possible overlap with the Archaic stage is not entirely out
of the question. More datings are needed!
At any rate, knowing that an early version of the Archaic
stage once existed over East Texas-witness certain sites in
Van Zandt County, Gregg County, Hopkins County, Titus
County, etc.-it is not without logic to suspect that the
Scottsbluff points found in Northwest Louisiana and adjacent East Texas were provided by an Archaic culture in
some way related to the period of the Carrollton focus on
the Upper Trinity River. In the later Archaic manifestations, complete with large numbers of Gary points, polished
stone, etc., which submerged these earlier cultures in the
area, such remnant traits almost totally disappeared.

STONE-LINED BASIN WITH CHARCOAL IN
LOWER CLEAR FORK SILT
CYRUS

N . RAY

When the writer discovered the deeply buried Gibson
Site midden deposit in January 1930, there then was an
8 inch layer of gravel and red silt at a depth of 24 feet
below the soil surface, which contained considerable charcoal and ashes throughout its exposure of 125 feet, and
several straight hearths of the usual forms and sizes, composed of flat stones 8 to 10 inches across.
These hearths all contained much charcoal, and throughout the gravel layer were flint chips of the kind produced
by nothing else but man's flint-knapping efforts. During
the intervening more than twenty-five years, the writer
has visited the site after rains, and has found a number
of different kinds of artifacts, including a mano stone and
a pocket of more than three hundred small thin flint flakes,
at a depth of 27 feet beneath the soil surface, almost at low
water level.
At the line between the gravel layer at the base of Upper
Clear Fork Silt, and the upper edge of the Lower Clear
Fork Silt, the writer has found several thick percussionfractured leaf-shaped blades on the base of which one larger
flake had been taken off of one face to thin the larger end
for hafting. In 1930 with the inadequate knowledge then
extant on the subject of American primitive man we assumed that it was an early attempt to produce a pre-Folsom
point, and accordingly named it the Abilene Point. Later
research proved that there also were artifacts of differing
forms buried there at least four feet below the gravel layer.
Also several Clear Fork Darts of types 1 and 2 were found
at the same level as the Abilene Points, and the Abilene
Points first found there may have been only some percussion-shaped knives made by Clear Fork men. These expert flint knappers used not only finely made knives and
dart heads but also many roughly fractured, thick, almondshaped knives, and heavy hand axes, spoke shaves and
burins were made by the percussion method. One type of

102

Texas Archeological Society

Clear Fork Culture percussion-fractured knife later found
frequently, closely resembles the original Abilene Points.
These later were found in the Gibson Site buried at the
same 24-foot level, but these usually are much larger than
the original Abilene Points found at the same level.
The Gibson Site is situated at a place where Elm Creek
turns from a north and south course in a bend to the east,
and it is mostly exposed on an east facing bank, but it also
extends for a distance around the bend to the east. Near
the end of this bank on the east the formation shows that
the whole bank there down nearly to water level has been
removed by erosion, and replaced by amorphous silt from
the top level in Nugent Silt 5 times, so that its top is level
with that of the seven ancient Nugent and Clear Fork Silts,
showing in regular banded formations south and west of
it. On Dr. Kirk Bryan's visit to this site in 1946 I pointed
out this replacement to Dr. Bryan and he agreed with me
as to what had happened, and then wanted to give it a
name as a separate and different silt formation. I then told
him that I had already named it the Ft. Griffin Silt, and
had found a lot of it near Ft. Griffin, and had seen it also
in the South Bend site and elsewhere. In these sites most
if not all of the original series of ancient banded silts have
been removed in comparatively recent time, usually at the
level of the bottom of Nugent Silt 5, and then the bank
was replaced from top to bottom with an amorphous and
unhanded sandy refill which may contain elements of anything earlier the floods washed away farther upstream. Some
of these sand bar deposits may have existed long enough
for Indians to have built villages on them as they refilled.
The W.P.A. dug in such a recent river refill of Ft. Griffin
Silt at the Hodges Site, when the whole series of ancient
banded silts lay in regular sequence just south of it.
No extensive digging has ever been done in these strata
and what has been done is only shallow digging into the
bank after artifacts have been found in place. The Gibson
Site has been watched closely since 1930 and it has caved
off a number of feet back into the bank, but the hearths

and artifacts and charcoal strata still keep the same relative
positions that they occupied over 25 years ago.
On September 10, 1955, after some heavy rains, my wife
and I visited the Gibson Site and found that considerable
blocks of silt had caved off, most of it having been washed
away. Located past the eastward bend of the creek, but
a considerable distance west of the Ft. Griffin replacement
area, and in the intact ancient banded deposits of Nugent
and Clear Fork Silts, we found the stones of a rock-lined,
basin-shaped pit projecting from the lowest silt deposit in
the bank, the stratum of Lower Clear Fork Silt. This basin
was rounded in shape like an old type wash basin. The
top edges of the rock basin were 62 inches across, and the
center 13 inches below the upper edges. The cross-section
so outlined contained 15 visible stones, which were firmly
embedded in the hard, dark red silt (Plates 15, 16). The
rains had washed out 39 stones, which lay on the creek bed
slope just below the hearth. Measurement of the loose rocks
below the hearth showed that most of them varied from
7 to 9 inches in length, 4 to 6 inches in width, and 2 to 3
inches in thickness. There are no rocks larger than gravel
size in this whole bank, from bottom to top at this site,
except where hearth accumulations containing much charcoal have washed out, and there is no question that the
hearth rocks were brought from elsewhere and placed
there by man.
The writer dropped an old iron tied to a cord over the
vertical bank above the hearth, while Mrs. Ray held the
iron inside the bottom of the basin. This carefully measured
vertical distance from the soil surface to the basin bottom
was 26 feet 3 inches. The inside depth of the basin being
13 inches, this leaves 25 feet as the distance from the upper
rim of the basin to the soil surface. The rock lining of
course adds to the thickness, and a horizontal layer of
charcoal two inches thick below the bottom adds still more,
which would make the total measurement from the soil
surface to the base of the charcoal layer close to 27 feet.

106

The charcoal layer was immediately under the stone
basin and had a horizontal length of 43 inches. There was
another hearth of the usual straight line of stones and charcoal situated 47 inches east of the basin. The thickness of
charcoal in it was also about two inches and it was likewise
below the top of the Lower Clear Fork Silt, at the same
depth.
Evidently the makers of these two hearths arrived on
the scene after most of the Lower Clear Fork Silts had
been deposited, dug a basin in the silt down to a probable
depth of 19 inches, burned a quantity of wood in it creating
a bed of coals, and then lined the pit above the charcoal
with flat rocks. Later depositions of Lower Clear Fork Silt
then filled the inside of the basin and covered the whole
structure about a foot deep before the next silt formed
above. The Upper Clear Fork Silt then formed, and so on
up to the present surface with the overburden consisting
of the Lower and Upper Clear Fork Silts and the five
Nugent Silts (Plate 15) .

PECULIAR MANOS FROM LOWER
PEASE RIVER VALLEY
JOHN HENRY RAy

Manos are very numerous on surface sites in the Lower
Pease and Red River valleys in Wilbarger County. Many
of these have a shallow concave basin on one side, the
purpose of which is unknown. Krieger has illustrated one
in "Culture Complexes and Chronology in Northern Texas,"
p. 306 and Plate 13, A-A' (University of Texas Publication
4640, 1946)

The grinding stones in this area are both of the concave
basin type in which an oval mana was used with rotary
motion, and the flat metate on which a wedge-shaped mano
was used with back-and-forth motion. The peculiar depressions occur on manos which go with both types of grinding
stones, on both one-hand and two-hand manos, and on one of
three heavy pestles used in mortars. They thus appear to be
a common trait among the peoples of this area.
The shape of these depressions varies from circular to
oval with an average length of 31/2 inches and width of 2
inches, the size varying with the size of the mano itself.
The depth is seldom as much as lJ4 inch. Nearly uniform
depth is maintained in the direction of the long axis of
the depression, but this axis is sometimes at an angle with
the long axis of the mano. The surface finish within the
depression is the same as on the surrounding surface of
the same face. These are well-finished manos with both
sides showing use, but the side with the depression shows
less use than the other and may be termed the back side.
There can be little doubt that the depressions were intentionally made in the same way as the rest of the mano;
that is, by pecking and grinding.
One apparent uniformity which is noted is that in nearly
every case, the outer lip on one side of the depression extends downward toward the edge of the mana at its lowest
or thinnest edge. In Plate 17, A the white chalk lines on
20 manos outline the rim of the depression and show where

it opens out on one side. An experiment was made, placing
a small marble in the center of each depression; on each
of the 20 manos tested, the marble promptly rolled out
through the low gap.
Also shown (Plate 17, B) are three well-shaped manos,
each having a saucer-shaped depression about 21/z inches
across and 1/s inch deep, but no outlet along the rim. In these
cases, the marble comes to rest in the very center of the
depression.
All the manos so fashioned are sandstone except for three
which are red granite (not shown) .

ANTHROPOLOGICAL THEORY AND
PLAINS ARCHEOLOGY 1
RUDOLPH c. TROIKE
The use of ethnological concepts in archeology is certainly
not new. Diffusion and the taxonomic approach were well
developed by cultural anthropologists before being taken
over into archeology. However, more abstract conceptual
tools have not been adopted so readily. When such concepts
have been employed, it is often without a clear idea of their
nature. To make them more available for use, it is necessary
first that they be understood.
One such concept is acculturation. It has been very profitable in the study of modern culture contacts. Only a few
workers have applied it to the study of archeological remains, yet there is an unrivalled opportunity in archeology
to study acculturation as it has occurred between nonWestern cultures in the past. Even these occasional studies
reflect the increasing awareness among archeologists of the
responsibility they bear to the rest of anthropology.
The neglect of the important concept of acculturation can
be laid to two factors. Many have tended to confuse it
with diffusion, and not see it as a useful independent tool.
Also, to study acculturation from material remains, it is
first necessary to apply the "conjunctive approach" and
express archeological information in ethnological terms.
These difficulties must be bridged to encourage wider use
of the acculturation concept.
In order to establish the value of acculturation as a tool
of archeological research, it will be necessary to clarify
the distinctions and relations between diffusion and acculturation. When this has been done, it then remains to demonstrate these differences through an analysis of some
problem, emphasizing first diffusion, then acculturation.

This procedure is significant, since the test of a concept
lies in its application. The problem chosen for examination
here concerns the effects of culture contacts on a series of
Central Plains groups which moved south into Texas and
Oklahoma approximately during the 12th and 13th centuries.
Diffusion and acculturation are properly parts of a larger
subject, culture change. Before they can be profitably discussed, some basic working definitions must be formulated.
"Diffusion" summarizes a whole set of statements about
observed phenomena and their results. Ethnologists have
described the transfer of artifacts from one area to another
through a series of individual exchanges. A set of such
activities, taken together, is said to constitute a pmcess of
diffusion. A concept, on the other hand, organizes observed
phenomena in a meaningful way. An archeologist discovering two similar artifact types some distance apart must
infer the whole sequence of interactions which together
account for the observed distribution. Diffusion, therefore,
conceptualizes the distribution of culture elements in space
and time as the end product of cultural transmission between groups in contact (either directly or indirectly).
The concept of acculturation derives from the view that
cultures are structured wholes whose contents are organized
or related through patterns or systems integrated to form
cultural universes. When foreign elements or patterns are
introduced as a result of contact, an imbalance may be
produced in the existing system. This initiates a process
of change in the structures or their functional links; this
is the process of acculturation. Therefore, acculturation formalizes the concept of change in sociocultural systems as
a process resulting from contact between culturally differentiated groups.
There is evident in the literature a considerable measure
of disagreement over where and how to draw a dividing
line between diffusion and acculturation. Willey (1952)
suggests the compound "diffusion-acculturation" to com-

Anthro~olog~c!l-l

promise the conflicting statements of theorists. Among these,
Herskovits (1938) has called diffusion "accomplished acculturation," while Linton (1940: 470, 479) has described diffusion as an "aspect of acculturation." Thus the first considers
acculturation to be a process leading to diffusion, while the
second regards diffusion as a process producing acculturation. This apparant paradox can be resolved only by an
understanding of the relative significance of the two concepts.
The statements of both Herskovits and Linton seem to
assume that a fixed relationship between the two processes
has been established by their very definitions. Such an
assumption does not hold good. Quite the contrary, no
fixed and invariable status can be assigned to either, but
rather a statement of their relations is needed. Treated
separately, each concept is independent and coordinate
with the other. However, when either diffusion or acculturation becomes the focal point in the course of a study
on culture change, the other is reduced to a subordinate
process. The crucial thing, then, is where the focus of
interest lies.
There remain certain prevalent ideas about the differences in diffusion and acculturation which should be dealt
with. These ideas are largely responsible for the confused
question: "Is this an instance of diffusion or acculturation?"
This is evoked by frequent attempts to establish some
quantitative distinction between the two processes, such as
length and number of contacts, or extent of modification
in borrowed traits. It is often said that the adoption of
several traits constitutes diffusion, but a large number of
borrowed traits makes acculturation. It could be pointed
out that the steel axe alone produced extensive acculturation
in some cultures, while a study of diffusion might well
take in the whole Mississippian Culture Pattern. Moreover,
no maximum or minimum scale exists to separate diffusion
and acculturation, nor has any objective weighting of
traits been established.

116

Texas Archeological Society

Quimby and Spoehr (1953) have used "acculturation" to
mean modification either in form or use of an artifact in
a new cultural context. Since material objects are not properly part of culture, this usage seems legitimate only if the
artifacts are taken as reflecting acculturative changes in
the cuiture patterns to which the objects have been introduced.
A second important consideration is the purpose of the
investigation. This will determine which process is to be
primary and which subordinate. A diffusion study is historically oriented, and is concerned with the spread of
traits or complexes from culture to culture through space
and time. The history of the bow in North America is an
example; the numerous cases of acculturation are only
background to the larger historical picture of diffusion.
However, an acculturation study is concerned with structural-functional integration of borrowed traits, either from
the view of the trait and its new cultural context, or from
the view of the cultural alterations set in motion by the
adoption of the new trait. A documentation of the trait's
diffusion is only a historical preface to the acculturation
study. The following may serve to illustrate the preceding
discussion:

Ethnologists and archeologists have a common basic tool
in the trait list. It permits extended comparisons to be
made as the initial step in the study of either diffusion or
acculturation. Depending on what traits and how many are
shared by two cultures, it is possible to infer borrowing
through contact or common historical origin. In analyzing
the problem selected for demonstration of the differences
in diffusion and acculturation studies, the first step must
therefore be the collection and comparison of trait lists.

General location of culture complexes discussed in t h is

T exas Archeological Society

Donald Lehmer (1954: 139-140) has compiled a list of
traits characteristic of what he has termed the "Plains
Village Pattern." He states that "these traits, many of them
decidedly generalized, appear as the warp of all the village
cultures of the Plains. Specific modifications of these traits,
occurring in combination with other and distinctive traits,
have definitely limited distributions in time and space."
Within this largest and most general complex, he has specified three basic variants: the Central Plains, the Middle
Missouri, and the Coalescent Traditions. Wesley Hurt (1953:
54) has amended "tradition" to "phase." The principal
aspect of the Central Plains Phase is the Upper Republican,
for which Krieger (1946: 270) has suggested a date of 1100
A.D. for its "patternization."

Plains Village Pattern
(Lehmer 1954: 139-140)
1. Subsistence based about equally on hunting and agriculture.

2. Semi-permanent villages.
3. Villages located adjacent to floodplains of large rivers.
4. Semi-subterranean earth lodges with entryways.
5. Undercut and straight-sided cache pits in and between
the houses.
6. Grit-tempered pottery with paddle-marked bodies and
cord- or tool-impressed decoration.
7. Small, light projectile points.
8. Chipped end-scrapers.
9. Hoe blades of bison scapulae.
10. Bone hide-dressing tools.
Hurt (1953: 51) adds "plain-surfaced pottery" to this list
and suggests that "earth lodges" should be reduced to phase
level, since they seem to lack universality. He has compiled
the following list from Lehmer (1954).

Anthropological Theory and Plai ns Archeology

119

Central Plains Phase
(Hurt 1953: 54)
1. Square houses, rounded corners, four primary posts set
in a square around a central firepit, entrance to the
east or west.
2. Ossuary burial, occasional individual inhumations.
3. Grit-tempered pots, bodies plain or cord-roughened,
flared or collared rims, decoration tool-impressed
(cord-impressed in the Sweetwater focus) .
4. Villages small, unfortified; houses arranged in no apparent order.
5. Arrowpoints with base notches, multiple side notches.
6. Diamond-shaped beveled knives.
7. Chipped celts.
8. Equal-arm (stone) elbow pipes
9. Bone awls generally made of deer cannon bones.
10. Single-hole arrowshaft wrenches of bone and antler.
11. Figurines of baked clay.
These traits give an outline of the cultures existing in
the Great Plains between the 12th and 16th centuries. At
the southern borders of the plains, in Texas and Oklahoma,
contemporaneous manifestations of similar character have
been found. Each one shares some traits with adjacent
circum-Plains traditions. A number of cultures on both sides
of the southern frontier of Plains expansion have been
chosen for comparison with one another and wi~h the
culture of the Central Plains hearth. The list used herein
(Table II) is based on functi onal groupings used by Krieger
(1946) and the revised versions by V. Watson (1950) and
Gallaher (1951). The cultures are arranged in geographical
order to give a picture of trait-distributions. Table I summarizes essential data on the cultures compared.

120

Texas Archeological Society

Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) have recently adjusted
age-estimates for the Gibson and Edwards Plateau Aspects
(Table I). The terminal dates for these complexes are now
set at 1200 and 1000 A.D. respectively. However, this shift
has left some disjunctions with certain established datings.
Antelope Creek and Upper Republican have been crossdated by Pueblo trade sherds (Wedel 1947: 153; Krieger
1946: 47, 143-144) and cannot be pushed much earlier than
1200 A.D.; Henrietta Focus has been placed at 1400-1600
A.D. by similar means, even in the latest estimate (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks 1954: 87). The close of Edwards Plateau
Aspect (or the start of Central Texas Aspect) is thus set
200-400 years before the establishment of Henrietta. However, Henrietta shares a number of traits with Edwards
Plateau, while Central Texas materials do not appear in
that region until much later (Krieger 1946: 97), probably
around 1500. Also, Henrietta pottery occurs along with
Sanders ware in the Wylie focus, which Stephenson (1951)
places at 1300-1600 A.D. Several alternative conclusions are
possible. Five hundred years could be allowed for the spread
of Central Texas traits to the Brazos River and a span of
1100-1500 credited to Wylie, or Henrietta could be set back
to about 800 A.D. As neither of these seems very tenable,
it may be suggested that a less drastic downward revision
of the Gibson and Central Texas Aspect dates would be
desirable.
Matrix form is used in Table III to present numbers
and percentages of common traits for each pair of cultures.
The percentage figure refers to the number of traits in
the list for the culture being matched in that horizontal
row. The list of traits was constructed specifically to reveal
the reciprocal exchange of traits between Plains groups
and the circum-Plains cultures. Where this exchange was
most extensive, a higher representation appears on the
chart. Hence the large number of traits for Optima and
Antelope Creek, which combine features of Upper Republican and Pecos; as against the lower figures for the "Caddean area" groups, whose contacts with eastern Plains

cultures produced little effect either way. Many of the
similarities they share with Upper Republican simply reflect the common origin of the Mississippian and Plains Village Patterns. The percentages given for these pre-Caddoan
cultures therefore express degrees of similarity to other
cultures only with respect to this list and not to their total
inventories. Some of the comparisons were undoubtedly
skewed by the absence of comparable or relevant data.
In general, though, if two cultures were historically related,
the preponderance of trait agreements will override even
important gaps in data. Occasionally, it may be necessary
to resort to qualitative assessments of specific features in
order to reach a conclusion.
Antelope Creek and Optima show the highest degree of
similarity, a fact which justifies their inclusion in a single
Panhandle Aspect. It could become necessary to re-interpret the two foci on a temporal rather than a spatial basis,
if differences in architecture should prove to be the result
of development through time. This is suggested by the
presence of Antelope Creek house-forms in the Optima area
and the assumption that some unidentified forms must have
preceded the development of the Antelope Creek house.
Henrietta has the smallest number of traits common to
other Plains cultures; at the same time, it shares over half
of its traits with Central Texas and nearly as many with
Edwards Plateau. Were it not for the higher correspondence
with such intermediate complexes as Washita River and
Antelope Creek, it is questionable whether Henrietta would
be easily recognized as Plains. It might eventually be desirable to combine Henrietta with Custer, Washita River,
and perhaps the Paint Creek Culture of Kansas in a "Southern Plains Aspect."
An examination of Table II shows the characteristic
Plains Village bison-scapula hoe to be one of the most
widely diffused items. In some areas it competed with hoes
of other material, such as slate or mussel shell. These bone
hoes have been reported from as far south as the Bonnell

124

Texas Archeological Society

site, a J ornada Mogollon site in New Mexico (Holden
1952: 128), where they occur with Alibates flint, quarried
near Antelope Creek, and with other Plains-like bone artifacts. There was also some slab-wall masonry reminiscent
of Panhandle foundations.
Cordmarking on pottery appears to decrease toward the
south and east. There may be some correlation between
the disappearance of this trait in the Plains region and the
spread of shell tempering. Orr (1946) traced the evolution
of shell temper as it began in Spiro and became institutionalized in Fort Coffee. It occurs only sparingly in Custer,
predominates in Washita River, and completely characterizes Henrietta pottery, which is also entirely plain.
Baerreis (1954: 44) has discussed the diffusion of the
Fresno point, which he describes as the "typical Middle
Mississippi" point. Whatever its origin, its introduction into
the southern Plains and "Caddoan" areas seems to be coextensive with the appearance there of Central Plains manifestations.
The trait lists brought together here contain material for
many more such observations. However, enough has been
said to illustrate the kind of results to be obtained from a
diffusion study, and to provide a basis for the second part
of this study-acculturation.
The concept itself has already been discussed, but the
procedures for the study of acculturation should be examined briefly. Keur (1941) has set forth these necessary
conditions to such a study by an archeologist.
(1) Trace the history of a particular culture, to establish
its characteristics and autonomy.
(2) Demonstrate a situation of contact and the cultural
differences between the contacting cultures.
(3) Document the history of the contact and consequent
changes in either or both cultures.

( 4) Draw the inferences necessary to describing the results of the whole process.
(5) Comparisons may be made and recurrent incidences

It is clear from these conditions that an analysis of diffusion must precede a study of acculturation. This is nowhere more obvious than in James Watson's (1952) study of
Cayua acculturation. Although announced as an non-historical, "structural" investigation, yet it had to begin with an
informal recognition of the diffused elements. His deliberate
neglect of the diffusion approach somewhat weakened his
material. In the present study of southern Plains Village
acculturation, the first three conditions have been substantially met already. The fourth step will be to put meat on
the bones of the trait lists.

A fairly clear quantitative presence-and-absence difference separates the Plains colonies from those native cultures
they encountered. Changes in specific traits shared reveal
more genuinely the actual relationships between these colonies. As differences are generally cumulative with distance,
the Panhandles cultures exhibit a continuous gradation of
features between Plains and Pueblos.
Krieger (1946: 73) has aptly expressed the implications
present here: "One can hardly escape the impression that
the peoples of this [Antelope Creek] focus were Plains
agriculturalists who pushed southward from one valley to
another as far as eastern New Mexico. Here contact was
established .. ." Krieger (1949: 98-9) has traced the boundary line which was created by this contact, across northeastern New Mexico, north Texas, and up through eastern
Oklahoma, wherever the immigrants found established native cultures.
Who these people were, and where they originated has
not been substantiated by archeology or ethnology. However,
they had achieved a culture which was economically balanced and well adapted to exploit the environment of the

132

Plains. Where and when this specialized culture was developed before it appeared full-blown on the Plains is as
yet unknown. Once in the Plains, the ecological integration
of the culture was remarkably successful and permitted a
rapid expansion of the population. The stage was thus set
for an early chapter of "manifest destiny," for the Great
Plains were almost uninhabited. The climate was favorable,
and the vast domain was there for the taking. The absence
of any obstacles to the spread of these horticulturist-hunters
is evidenced in the lack of defensive organization among
their villages.
Within a fairly short time the limits of the Plains environment were reached, and expansion came to an end.
Perhaps it was because the areas around the southern end
of the Plains were occupied by peoples of differing cultural
traditions who had specialized to meet the conditions of
their own environments and were uninterested in exploiting
the adjacent country. Or perhaps the Plains Villagers were
not equipped either offensively or ecologically to subdue
these new areas. Whatever the cause, the boundary was
established and acculturation began to modify the frontier
settlements.
The contact established between the Plains colonists in
the Panhandle and those of Pecos Pueblo and nearby
related sites had important results for both groups. It is
probable that from time to time, hunting parties visited
the Pueblo, and it may be that groups from Pecos also
travelled east. A valuable item of trade from which "a
majority of the Pecos chipped artifacts were fashioned was
'Alibates Flint', a red-banded agatized dolomite which could
only be obtained from the quarries north of Amarillo. That
many of the objects were actually chipped at Pecos is
shown by large numbers of flakes of this material in the
upper rubbish" (Krieger 1946: 62). It appears that the
Panhandle Plains groups stimulated the Pecos men to take
a greater interest in hunting, including bison-hunting. This
would explain the greater number and variety of bone

Anthropological Theory and Plains Archeology

133

and chipped flint artifacts at Pecos than is found in other
pueblos of the Southwest (Krieger 1946: 62-63).
Along with a few pieces of Pueblo trade pottery, the
visiting Plains hunters brought back observations and information on Puebloan architecture. The result was that the
Antelope Creek villages on the South Canadian River took
over the idea of stone masonry and multiroomed structures,
reproduced these by their own unique methods, and in the
resulting syncretism expressed their essentially different
social heritage. Krieger (1946: 43) has devoted considerable
discussion to these structures. It is apparent that it was
largely a Puebloan idea but not Puebloan techniques which
were adopted. Internally, the houses retain most of the
features characteristic of the Central Plains house. Externally, the use of adobe and masonry, the presence of multiroomed dwellings oriented to the cardinal directions, the
conversion of the entryway into a ventilator, the adoption
of the roof hatchway, and possibly the presence of a clay
bank "altar" inside the house opposite the ventilator, all
point to an attempt to reproduce the Southwestern pueblo.
The evidence that this was a native effort seems to lie
in the unique masonry technique employed. Foundations
were formed by two parallel rows of upright caliche slabs
with rubble fill between them; masonry walls continued
on above or another paired row of slabs might be set inside
the margins of those below, and so on up the wall. Watson
(1950: 60-61) has suggested a possible sequence by which
such slab-masonry could have developed from the singleslab rows set around Optima house walls. The slabs functioned in an entirely different way from those in Antelope
Creek Focus sites. In the Optima Focus, they are outside
the wall, where they supported the wall posts and sealed
out rain water. It may be that the practice was suggested
by the Upper Republican use of slabs for lining graves, as
at Optima the entryway was built and roofed with slabs.
Without any stratigraphy or seriation of ruins only speculation is possible.

------~---------------

As a rule, the greater the differences between two cultures in contact, the stronger will be the stimuli to acculturation. This may be responsible for the more extensive acculturation which occurred between Pecos and Antelope Creek than between the latter and Optima. In addition,
the conditions surrounding contacts serve to stimulate as
well as control the direction of subsequent changes. Krieger
(1946: 74) repeats Kelley's suggestion that the marriage
of a few Pueblo women into the Panhandle villages could
have initiated the architectural changes there; this would
explain the absence of Puebloan ceremonial features, because Pueblo women control the houses while men own the
ceremonial properties.
According to Kidder (1924: 5), the Pueblo "women built
the walls of stone and adobe mud, the men cut and set the
roof beams." But structural details at Antelope Creek argue
for an indigenous architecture. Women are the potters and
corn-grinders among the Puebloans. Again, Krieger (1946:
17-39) nowhere mentions more than a handful of Pueblo
sherds at any Panhandle site, no more than might be
expected from trade. Finally, even the eastern Pueblos
were probably all matrilocal at this time, as most likely
the Plains groups were also. Such a situation militates
against the removal of a woman from her home to a foreign
village where she could claim no residence. A more likely
alternative for sources of diffusion through hunting-trading
parties has already been mentioned.
1The hybrid culture in the Panhandles was short-lived,
however. "According to Weakley ... the period 1439-1468
was one of almost continual drought in the Panhandles
region" (V. Watson 1950: 44). The high tide of Plains Village
expansion was past. Like the San Juan Anasazi 200 years
before, these horticulturists evacuated their frontier and
began a retreat. By the time of Coronado's entrada of 1541,
only nomadic, non-ceramic bison hunters occupied the area
(Krieger 1946: 370). The retraction of the Plains Village
boundaries culminated when "the Upper Republican occu-

Anthropological Theory and Plains Archeology

135

pation of the Central Plains was terminated by the drought
of 1539 to 1564" (Lehmer 1954: 149).
The Custer and Washita River foci show few distinctive
modifications from Upper Republican, partly due to the
absence of any strong cultural boundary. Most of the
changes which took place must therefore be treated as
simple diffusion or ecological adaptation.
Farther south, the Plains Village colonies of Henrietta
Focus encountered a real cultural frontier when they overran the northern ranges of the Edwards Plateau culture.
The invasion was countered sometime later by bands of
the developing Central Texas culture to the south. Krieger
(1946: 97) has documented a case of contact between these
peoples. Two graves at the Harrell site were "multiple
interments and all nine arrowpoints found in them suggested the cause of death." These were all Central Texas
Scallorn points, of which but 24 occurred in the site. Such
evidence at least helps set Henrietta apart from Central
Texas, despite close cultural similarities resulting from intensive acculturation. Cliffton and Alba points from northeast Texas suggest earlier contacts with groups down the
Red or Trinity Rivers, perhaps through Wylie Focus.
The use of shell tempering for pottery probably diffused
among the Plains Villagers before they migrated as far
south as Texas. The practice was already institutionalized
among the Henrietta peoples. They seemingly also acquired
the atlatl from local Edwards Plateau natives. Krieger
(1946: 95) remarks that "the presence of a number of dart
points also distinctive of 'Edwards Plateau Culture' points
to a continuum of older central Texas traits into what is
otherwise a radically different and later culture in the
upper Brazos Valley."
Perhaps even more significant is evidence for the adoption of "burnt-rock middens" in the Henrietta Focus area.
These are a characteristic feature of Edwards PlateauCentral Texas sites. They arose from the custom of drawing
up slabs of native Cretaceous limestone around campfires,

136

Texas Archeological Society

which caused the stone to crack and required new pieces
to be brought in at intervals, the cracked sections being
tossed out. In time a favored camping spot might come to
possess a low circular mound of stones.
Since house structures are unknown for Henrietta, it is
reasonable to assume that these hearths, ringed by some
sort of light, temporary buildings which left no remains,
served as the occupational sites of the acculturated Plains
colonists. The degree of acculturation they experienced
amounted to virtual syncretism; a measure of this is given
in Table III, which shows Henrietta shares 30 traits with
Upper Republican, but 27 with Edwards Plateau and 34
with Central Texas.
Just to the east of Henrietta, the Wylie focus has been
recognized (Stephenson 1951) . Results of work done there
have been inconclusive regarding the assignation of the
complex to either the Plains or the Gibson-Fulton Aspects.
The present comparisons indicate a possible predominance
of Plains traits, with the highest agreement lying between
Wylie and Henrietta (30) as against 22 common traits
between Wylie and Sanders. However, this difference is
insufficient to establish a genetic Plains relation for Wylie,
since the list used here does not give complete representation to the traits of the "Caddoan" area complexes. It may
be that this was a "border culture" which was the result
of a fusion of Gibson and Plains traits, with a certain admixture of elements from the south. If so, this would be a most
interesting case of intensive acculturation. However, more
definitive work is needed for this and the neighboring foci
to place the Wylie sites in their true historical perspective.
Sanders, Fort Coffee, and Turkey Bluff were in a sense
all frontier cultures, a position which left them exposed
to the effects of contact with immigrant Plains groups.
Each differs rather distinctly from the contemporaneous
cultures of the same aspect which were not so directly
exposed. The earliest of the three, Sanders, came to an
end before the Plains colonies had become very numerous

Anthropological Theory and Plains ArcheoLogy

137

in the southern Plains. Only three typically Plains traits
reached Sanders: bison scapula hoes, sandstone hones, and
L-shaped stone elbow pipes (Krieger 1946: 157, 218). These
were probably trade objects, since there is little evidence
for actual acculturation in Sanders. The two later foci, after
longer contact, picked up a few additional traits. However,
again no substantial acculturation seems to have taken
place.
Archeological material can be used to derive what Lowie
has called "metaethnological" information. Such broad cultural characteristics as basic orientations, ecological adaptation, or degrees of social integration, when recognized,
can add a new dimension to the interpretation of problems
of culture history which the archeologist encounters. Here
the recognition can increase the understanding of the
course which acculturation took in the cultures concerned.
The Edwards Plateau and the succeeding Central Texas
cultures were a part of the great "ethnographic sink," as
Swanton has described it, which covered northeastern
Mexico and southern Texas. Cultures of this area were
traditionally rooted to their ancient simple hunting-andgathering existence. Their extreme conservatism made them
almost proof against influence from the various complex
cultures surrounding their borders.
The Gibson and Fulton aspects of the "Caddoan area"
had a very complex history which has not been fully explored yet. Some time before the Plains Village expansion
took place, the great Southern Cult developed in this area,
with its great ceremonial center at Spiro. This intense
religious ferment, perhaps sparked from Mexico and carried
by the evangelistic activities of missionary-priests throughout the Southeast, had a relatively short though brilliant
career. In its wake the contours of culture growth continued largely unaffected, leaving villages of fairly stable,
quiescent populations. By the time the migrating Plains
bands appeared, the religious fervor was gone and the
Fulton Aspect groups were indifferent to outside contacts.

138

Texas Archeological Society

Kroeber's characterization of Southwestern culture would
partially serve for the "Caddoan area" as well. The Plains
culture he mentions is of the later horse-nomads, but his
remarks will serve for the Plains Village tribes as well.
"The Southwestern culture has been non-expansive; its
Pueblo form conspicuously so ... . In the Plains there are
some traits that can presumably be led back to a Southwestern origin, earth-altars, for instance, dice-scoring on a
circuit, perhaps the fetish bundle and shields. In the main,
however, it is remarkable how little the Plains seem to have
taken over from the Southwest. The reciprocal influence
seems at least equal . . . . As normally it is the more advanced culture that affects the other most, Southwestern
impulses are indicated as unusually self-contained, centripetal, perhaps weak in all respects except tenacity"
(Kroeber 1928: 393) .
By contrast with all of these cultures, the Plains Village
peoples must have appeared active, responsive, aggressive.
They showed a greater flexibility in accommodating to
local conditions and a readiness to exploit the adaptive
techniques found in other cultures. Despite some similarities in the characteristics of the three circum-Plains cultures,
various other factors differentially affected the results in
each case of acculturation. Most of these factors, such as
distance, conditions of contact, and distinctiveness of culture patterns, have already been discussed.
Turning now to Keur's fifth step in the study of acculturation, the results of the analyses made in this investigation
can be profitably compared with preceding studies. Willey
(1952) examined three archeological cases of "culture colonization," in which a local group was conquered by another
of more complex culture. In time a single "fusion culture"
developed. Keur (1941) studied archeological evidence for
Navajo acculturation developing from Pueblo contacts; only trade and agitation probably were involved. Despite
differing degrees of intimacy and social control in the two
sets of contacts, both studies reveal similar contours in the
acculturation process. Of the examples of Plains accultu-

Anthropologi cal Theory and Plains Archeology

139

ration, only the Panhandle groups fit this picture; the variable of distance is probably responsible for any disparity.
(1) The less advanced group remained culturally subordinate (or peripheral) and distinct from the higher
culture.
(2) The less advanced group borrowed extensively from
the more complex culture.
(3) Final acculturative results were:
(a) The more advanced achievements were permanently accepted: architecture, agriculture.
(b) Native arts of the simpler culture resurged after
quiescence or repression: pottery, ritual, hunting.
(c) Specialized arts of the higher culture, temporarily adopted as novelties, were "worn down":
elaborate pottery forms, art styles.
Plains Village contacts with proto-Caddoan groups, although resulting in a few cases of diffusion, brought about
no traceable acculturation involving an entire category of
culture. Krieger (1946: 156-157) remarks on the situation:
"We find here a striking and highly significant circumstance
in that there is very little in common between the Plainslike Henrietta focus and the cultures of the 'Caddo area'
directly to the east . . . . The contrasts are so strong that
there can be little doubt that two basically different cultural
traditions existed here side by side with practically no
interchange of specific traits." The relationships of these
cultures constituted a situational type of "cultural pluralism." The only exception might be the Wylie Focus, which
perhaps was a true "fusion culture."
Where the Plains Village culture was carried south of
the Red River, acculturation followed a perverse path of
ecological accomodation. The situation began as one of "cultural colonization" and ended in what might be called "cultural regression." Two explanations are possible: the tradi-

tional conservatism of the Edwards Plateau natives may
have overweighed the incentives to cultural advancement,
or the lack of reinforcing influences from the cultural
hearth, again owing to distance, may have left the Henrietta
colony on the cultural defensive. It would be desirable to
conduct further research to discover whether these results
fit into a separate acculturational type, and if so, what its
determinants and parameters are.
SUMMARY
What contribution can archeology make to ethnology?
The additional time depth archeology adds to the ethnographical picture can add greatly to an understanding of
culture history. Southwestern ethnologists and archeologists have tended to be as centripetal in their interests as
the cultures they study. Consequently there has been scant
attention given to the important chapter of foreign relations
in Pueblo prehistory. The materials analyzed here, along
with certain others, can provide solutions to a multitude
of ethnological problems.
It has been twenty years now since archeologists demonstrated the recency of bison-hunting nomadism in the Great
Plains. Before that time, ethnographic evidence for Plains
culture influence in the Southwest Pueblos was understood
to refer to the Plains cultures known in historic times. In
1929, Elsie Clews Parsons explained Pueblo-Pawnee ritual
parallels by suggesting a Southwestern origin for the Pawnee. The Caddoan linguistic affiliation of the Pawnee disallows this idea.

However, Wedel (1940) has conclusively demonstrated
the identity of proto-historic Pawnee with the Lower Loup
Focus, which in turn can be derived from the Upper Republican Aspect of an earlier period. Further, Upper Republican sites have now been recognized in western Kansas
and in Colorado. From here it is but a step to the partially
contemporaneous Pueblo III occupation of the San Juan
Anasazi in southern Colorado and northern Arizona . Contacts between these groups, perhaps reinforced by the later

Anthropo logi cal The ory and Plains Archeology

141

contacts between Pecos and the Panhandle groups, can
probably account for the parallels which so puzzled Parsons.
Certainly this phase of An asazi- Plains Village relations
deserves more intensive study, with a combining of archeological and ethnological data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of culture history in both areas.

EVIDENCE OF EARLY MAN IN TORRANCE
COUNTY, NEW !viEXIC0 1
C. v . HAYNES,

JR.

For the past three years I have devoted vacations and
what spare time I could afford to studying and investigating evidences of Early Man in New Mexico. For a number
of reasons, from the beginning I found Torrance County
to be one of the most interesting in the state. Local collections, almost without exception, contain spear points that
have been attributed to Early Man. Because of drouth in
the 1930's and in recent years, subsoils have been exposed
in many areas, several of which have yielded ancient artifacts and extinct fauna. The county encompasses the southern half of the Estancia basin and the whole of the Encino
and Pinos Wells basins as described by 0. E. Meinzer (1911).
From all indications, it may be deduced that this area
once comprised a lush lake-studded terrain, ideally suited to
the hunting of mammoth and bison during the late Pleistocene and early Recent epochs.
The only standing bodies of water now existing in the
ancient lake beds are salt flats that contain water only
after heavy rains. These depressions do not necessarily correspond to the last remnants of the ancient lakes since they
are formed by wind erosion to the ground-water level and
are characterized by mounds of eolian sand around the leeward sides. The shore lines of the ancient lakes varied as
the water level fluctuated with changing climatic conditions.
Antevs (1935) has reviewed the geology and reconstructed
the past climatic history of the area, estimating an age of
about 15,000 years for the highest stand of Lake Estancia.
This stand was at an elevation of about 6,200 feet.
In addition, Torrance County 'i ncludes part of th e SandiaManzano area, where a sizable contribution to our knowledge of Early Man has been made (Hibben, 1941). Folsom

and valuable criticism offered me by Alex D. Krieger, H. M.
Wormington, and Fred Wendorf, who reviewed the manuscript.

and "Yuma" finds in this area have previously been mentioned by Hurt (1942) .
DURAN MESA
Duran Mesa lies two and a half miles west of Duran,
New Mexico, on the eastern edge of the Pinos Wells Basin.
It is a prominent landmark which overlooks the adjacent
basins. The basal slopes on the north and east sides of the
mesa consist of aeolian sand piled against the steep sides.
This sand presumably originated from the basins and was
deposited by westerly winds eddying over the mesa. The
sand hills at present support a sparse vegetation of grass,
cedar, juniper, and an occasional ponderosa pine. Because
of the recent dryness, th e grass mantle has dwindled sufficiently to allow the wind to scoop out shallow depressions.
It was in these eroded patches that Mr. and Mrs. Alonzo
Sultemeier of Vaughn, New Mexico began finding artifacts
several years ago.
Site 1 (Fig. 5) is on the property of Mr. Neal B. Smith
of Duran, at the base of a gully running down the side of
the mesa. Mr. Smith states that a spring was active in this
gully some 20 years ago and that an Indian trail to it has
only recently become obliterated.
The artifacts consist of whole or broken points and scrapers, all of which have come from the surface. Bases of
broken points predominate. The abundance of spalls and
flint debris indicates that artifacts were fashioned at this
site.
From the wide variety of points represented, it is evident
that several different peoples visited the locality. Since all
of the material obtained thus far is from the surface, it is
impossible to state whether the artifacts are contemporaneous or not. Even though a Folsom point and a Plainview
point base fragment were found on the same surface as
Eden and Portales artifacts, we can assume that at least
one time gap is indicated: the latter types, wherever superimposed, have always been found to overlie the former,

and in some cases are separated by a stratigraphic hiatus
(Sellards, 1952).
The only other materials that might date within or even
antedate Folsom times are several unclassified points (Plate
18, A-C, G). While such points seem to have a wide distribution in New Mexico and neighboring states, little is known
about them. However, that in Plate 18, C compares in some
features with one from Sandia Cave, New Mexico (Hibben,
1941, Plate 12, No. 1 B).
The Folsom point (Plate 18, M) previously mentioned
lacks both tip and base. Although one channel is askew
and a fine marginal retouch is lacking, the basal edges are
smooth and it is reasonable to assume that the artifact
was once complete. The Plainview point (Plate 19, F) is
similar to those found at the type site (Krieger, 1947, Plates
3, 4), even to thinning the base by removal of three narrow,
parallel spalls. This base is made of Alibates flint, as are
four of those from the original Plainview site (Krieger,
1947, p. 939)
0

For the most part, the other points from Duran Mesa
represent types generally believed to be later than Folsom
or to be associated with essentially modern forms of bison.
Eden material (Moss, 1951) is represented by a typical stem
(Plate 19, A) and a complete example (Plate 18, D). Plate
18, 0 may be best classified as an Eden stem showing fine
parallel flaking. A small Scottsbluff point (Plate 18, K) that
closely resembles one from the Portales horizon at Blackwater Draw (Sellards, 1952, Fig. 37, H) was found by the
Sultemeiers. Several bases (Plate 18, H, N) can be compared with points of the Hot Springs focus near Angostura,
South Dakota (Hughes, 1949, Fig. 68). Plate 18, H has
slightly concave edges; however, this might well have resulted from grinding rather than intention.
Two points (Plate 18, E, F) and four bases (Plate 19, B-E)
are of interest as they compare favorably with points from
the Agate Basin in Wyoming (Roberts, 1951, p. 19). That
in Plate 19, E reveals oblique parallel flaking. The point in

148

Texas Archeological Society

Plate 18, L might also be classed with those from Agate
Basin, were it not so short; it is also very similar to a
specimen from the Portales horizon at Blackwater Draw,
New Mexico (Sellards, 1952, Fig. 36, E). In outline the
specimen in Plate 18, J is similar to the "Long" point shown
by Hughes (1949, Fig. 68, P) from South Dakota. Hughes'
"Long type" is now generally known as Angostura (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p. 402 and Plate 80).
It seems possible that the makers of some points designed
them with long bodies so that if the tips snapped off they
could be re-pointed and still leave enough material to work
with. Several specimens (Plate 18, D, I, J, K, L) from this
area could be the objects of such economy. At first glance
Plate 18, I might be called a well-made San Jon point (Roberts, 1942) , but upon closer examination it appears to have
been either a re-shaped Scottsbluff point with the shoulders
removed in the process, or a small example of the Milnesand
type recently recognized by Sellards (1955, Figs. 98-100) .

Other artifacts from Duran Mesa comprise "snub-nosed"
scrapers, side scrapers, and portions of flint knives. In the
order of prevalence, the materials used in the manufacture
of artifacts include Alibates flint, quartzite, chalcedony,
blue-gray flint, red pitchstone, and a hard siliceous mudstone. The preponderance of Alibates flint in spalls as well
as complete artifacts is of interest because the quarries for
this material are over 300 miles away, north of Amarillo,
Texas.
LAS TRINCHERAS
A group of mesas four miles north of Duran on the Hindi
ranch is known as the Trincheras (Fig. 5, site 2) . Here, in
a situation similar to that at Duran Mesa, Nabay Hindi
found several interesting point fragments, three of which
(Plate 19, G-I) are basal portions, and one other is a midsection. They all display ground edges, marginal retouch,
and a wavy base formed by the nubbin or fluting seat in
the basal concavity so prevalent in classic Folsom points
such as those found at Lindenmeier, Colorado (Roberts,

1935) . These points, however, are too thin to have been
fluted. One reason for their thinness is that they are flaked
horizontally parallel in such a manner that some of the
spalls went from one edge to the other without a break, and
without curving to any extent. As a result, the cross-section
is relatively flat rather than markedly bi-convex. This characteristic is noticeable on the tip of some classic Folsom
points where the channel flake did not remove all the
horizontal flaking. It is possible that some makers of Folsomlike points preferred to thin them by removing wide, flat
horizontal flakes rather than by fluting. A number of "unfluted Folsom points" similarly thin have been described
at the Scharbauer ranch site near Midland, Texas (Wendorf,
Krieger, Albritton, and Stewart, 1955, pp. 48-49, 57, and Fig.
16, No. 27).
PINOS MOUNTAINS
The collections of Alonzo Sultemeier of Vaughn, Lonnie
Welch of Pinos Wells, and K. W. Kendall of Willard, all
contain ancient spear points found in or about the Pinos
Mountains (Fig. 5). These mountains, forming the only
prominent elevation between the southern extremity of
the Estancia basin and the Pinos Wells basin, lie 14 miles
west of Duran Mesa. Attempts to farm the area adjacent
to the mountains over the past 30 years have resulted in
many denuded fields. These fields and small windswept
patches on the slopes have yielded several spear points
that can be attributed to Early Man.
Two basal fragments of spear points in the Sultemeier
collection came from a sandy area on the southeastern
slopes (Fig. 5, site 5). One (Plate 19, J) represents a finely
made Eden point with a marked diamond cross-section and
has ground edges but no shoulders. The material appears
to be black chert now covered with a fine arenaceous encrustation. The other one (Plate 19, K) is unusual in that
the edges and base of the stem are deeply concave. This
point also was made from a black siliceous material which
is now encrusted.

152

Texas Archeological Society

Lonnie Welch and members of his family have been
collecting artifacts from the Pinos Mountains for many
years. Among these are several worthy of mention in relation to Early Man. A classic Folsom point (Plate 19, M)
was found in a wind-blown field Â· (Fig. 5, site 3) three miles
north of the mountains. A mile or so south is another field
(Fig. 5, site 4) on the north slope of the mountains. It is
here that Mrs. Welch found a large fluted point (Plate 19, 0)
of Alibates flint. It is almost a duplicate of one associated
with the Naco mammoth in Arizona (Haury, 1953, Fig.
6-7, H) and can, without question, be classified as a Clovis
fluted point. A single channel flake 2 em. long has been
removed from one side, whereas the other side has been
thinned by the removal of four converging spalls. As on
Clovis fluted points, the edges show smoothing for over
a third of the total length of the specimen.
The exact occurences of the other points (Plate 19,
L, N, P, Q) in the Welch collection are not definite. They
are for the most part unclassified although Plate 19, N
has a remote resemblance to Sandia points. Plate 19, P
and Q are interesting in that they have been observed in
several collections throughout New Mexico and are similar
to some illustrated from Concho, Arizona (Wendorf and
Thomas, 1951, Fig. 48, B, C, E, F).
KENDALL COLLECTION
Mr. K. W. Kendall of Willard, New Mexico, homesteaded
some 30 years ago on property a mile or so west of the
Pinos Mountains. During the drouth of the early 1930's
one of his fields (Fig. 5, site 6) became scoured to a depth
of several feet. While this scouring was taking place, Mr.
Kendall picked up many artifacts as they were exposed
by the wind and noted several hearths and firepits. He has
closely examined this blowout and others in the surrounding country ever since, and has acquired a fine collection
of ancient points.
Â·
In this collection two points (not illustrated) are similar
to that of Plate 18, J, and to the specimen from Blackwater

Draw included in the Portales complex (Sellards, 1952,
Fig. 36, E). Another is Folsom in outline but is unfluted
and crudely made from black andesite. The basal portion
of a large well-made fluted point (Plate 19, R) of orangewhite Alibates flint can be classed only with Clovis fluted .
A crude but interesting point was found protruding from
the walls of an arroyo in the Pinos Mountains. Again it is
a type about which little is known, although it is assumed
to be ancient (Hibben, personal communication) . A point
from near Concho, Arizona (Wendorf and Thomas, 1951,
Fig. 47, A) closely resembles Mr. Kendall's except for the
concave base.
Because the drought of the past few years has caused
renewed wind erosion, Mr. Kendall was able to make some
very interesting finds in 1954. The most significant of these
finds was reported to Dr. Hibben of the University of New
Mexico, who devoted part of the 1954 field session to excavating mammoth and artifact material from denuded
deposits (Fig. 5, site 8) west of Rattlesnake Hill, seven miles
south of Lucy, New Mexico. An unusual assemblage of
points, including variants of the Sandia types, was found
on and below the surface along with skeletal material
(Hibben, personal communication).
Another site worthy of special mention is a wind eroded
draw (Fig. 5, site 11) approximately 10 miles north and
a little east of Lucy on the outer margin of what Meinzer
considered the littoral zone of beach materials and alluvium
surrounding ancient Lake Estancia. This draw rarely contains water, and what is carried is probably absorbed long
before reaching the flats. As a result, the draw is filled
with deposits of sand and clay which have been gouged by
the wind revealing an unusual number of artifacts in a
small area of approximately 2000 square feet. Each of the
seven or more points (Plate 20, A is an example) represented are readily comparable to those found at the Agate
Basin site in Wyoming (Roberts, 1951, p. 19) except that
the complete ones are rather short, possibly from having
been re-sharpened. If Plate 20, A were to be re-pointed to

156

Texas Archeological Society

a relatively blunt, somewhat triangular, tip it would approximate some of the other specimens found but not illustrated here. Besides the points, nearly a dozen scrapers and
a knife were obtained by Mr. Kendall and members of his
family . Additional investigation may warrant a separate
report on this site.
Other finds by Mr. Kendall include a large bison skull
weathering in a dune area (Fig. 5, site 10) eight miles
north and a little east of Lucy. It is less than two miles
from the previously mentioned site 11 and, given a litt le
more time and dry weather, this area should reveal additional material of interest. A single find in a blown-out field
(Fig. 5, site 9) only two miles north of Lucy is a skillfully
worked point nearly identical with one found at Blackwater Draw in the Portales horizon (Sellards, 1952, Fig.
36-36 b) . This would now be classified with the Milnesand
type (Sellards, 1955).
Artifacts of more recent origin, but of no less import, have
appeared in a wind-eroded ravine (Fig. 5, site 7) two and
one half miles northeast of the abandoned town of Progresso on the Velasquez ranch. It has revealed pre-pottery
material that may be related to the Atrisco sites (Campbell
and Ellis, 1952) . Many rock-lined hearths, one-hand manos,
and sandstone slab metates were observed. Many of the
points resemble some of those illustrated by Campbell and
Ellis (1952, Figs. 71-72, middle rows). It should be noted
that this same type of material has appeared at Duran Mesa,
the Pinos Mountains, and in other neighboring areas.
BIGBEE SITE
According to Mrs. J. Frank Bigbee, a half section of
land (Fig. 5, site 12) on the Bigbee ranch , 10 miles north
of Encino, was plowed some 20 years ago. Since that time
it has been almost completely denuded by wind which has
piled dunes across State Highway 3 to such an extent that
the road has had to be re-routed several times around the
drifting sands. Even though it may be small compensation
for the futile efforts of the farmer, his field has produced

an interesting assemblage of material used by the ancient
hunters. My attention was focused on this area after reconoitering revealed the basal portion of what might be
termed an unfluted Folsom point (Plate 20, H). On a later
visit an additional segment t hat matched this base was
found along with another similar base (Plate 20, I). These
segments, which closely resemble those previously mentioned from the Trincheras, are characterized by parallel
flaking that crosses the entire face horizontally from one
edge to the other, by marginal retouch, and by the remains
of a nubbin in the basal concavity. Indisputable Folsom
evidence was found in the form of a basal portion of a
point (Plate 20, J) of tan quartzite. It is quite similar to the
only quartzite point from the original Folsom type site, even
to the point of being fluted on only one side (Howard, 1943,
Pl. VIII, C) .
Additional artifacts consist of a greenstone base (Plate
20, L) reminiscent of those from the Agate Basin (Roberts,
1951), the basal portion of a finely made Milnesand (?)
point (Plate 20, F) , and the base (Plate 20, E) of a large
fluted obsidian point, probably Clovis fluted (Cotter, 1937,
Pl. 3). A complete point (Plate 20, C) resembles the Long
or Angostura type (Hughes, 1949, Fig. 68 P) although it
appears to have been re-pointed. Each edge of the tip has
been knapped from alternate sides producing a pronounced
beveled or twisted effect. A point (Plate 20, D) similar
to two from the Pinos Mountains (Plate 19, P, Q) and
those from an undescribed site in Bernalillo County, was
found by Lieutenant Gerald C. Shelton of Sandia Base,
New Mexico. He also found the basal portion of a fluted
point (Plate 20, K) which closely resembles those from
the Miami site in Texas which are considered to be Clovis
fluted points (Sellards, 1952, Figs. 8, 9). A nondescript base
(Plate 20, G) is difficult to associate with any clea.rly defined type. Several scrapers and a small fragment of a
fluted point were also found.
What turned out to be the most significant find at the
Bigbee site was that portions of mammoth bones wer e

exposed in a mottled red and gray sandy-clay soil on the
south edge of the blown field. During the summer of 1953,
I excavated a humerus and dug several test holes. These
previous visits failed to disclose any artifact material in
association with mammoth. In the late spring of 1954, Lieutenant Shelton, who is a careful observer, inspected the
site and again no artifacts appeared in association with the
mammoth material. A month later we found more bone
fragments had been exposed by the recent wind and I discovered a large point (Plate 20, B) several feet down slope
from a small ledge where the skeletal material was originating. About the point were several scattered bone fragments. It is reasonable to assume that the point had been
exposed only recently, in fact, within the few days prior
to our visit. In addition, a large flint chip occurred with
the bone fragments weathering from the surface.
In size, outline, and workmanship the point in Plate 20, B
compares with Clovis fluted points and, like the majority
of these, the basal edges and concave base are ground quite
smooth; however, there is no fluting and the basal edges
are notably concave. It is likely that the latter fact is
partly due to the high degree of edge grinding. This specimen may be compared with the Plainview type, as it is
closely similar in all dimensions to number 725-5 from the
Plainview site (Krieger, 1947, Plate 5, No. 1) . Dr. Krieger
examined the specimen and suggested a Plainview classification; however, he pointed out that Clovis and Plainview
points are very similar in shape and dimensions, and that
unfluted points may occasionally accompany fluted Clovis
points, in which case it would be difficult if not impossible
to distinguish them from Plainview points. The association
of Plainview points with mammoth in the Great Plains is
still an open question (Krieger and Wendorf, personal
communications). Although mammoth remains were found
in parts of the Plainview site, their association with the
deposit containing bison fossils and artifacts was not definitely established (Sellards, Evans, Meade, and Krieger,
1947) .

More recent materials have also been found at the Bigbee
site. On the north rim several large camp sites are exposed,
revealing a large quantity of broken Pedernal quartzite
fragments. The remarkably uniform arrow points and potsherds from these camps are of rather recent origin.
OTHER LOCALITIES
Two areas south of the Bigbee ranch deserve mention.
One is the Berlier ranch (Fig. 5, site 13) about 10 miles
northeast of Encino. Several of the points in the collection
of Mrs. Theo Berlier are, no doubt, quite old; however,
they must await classification and m ore information on
the sites. Plate 20, N resembles a Sandia point in shape and
flaking but does not have the pronounced shoulder.
The other site is a deeply blown-out area three and onehalf miles east of Encino. In an ancient sand-hill area
(Fig. 5, site 14) overlooking a windswept basin, Alonzo
Sultemeier of Vaughn found a stubby point (Plate 20, M).
It is problematical whether it should be classified as Scottsbluff or Milnesand, for the very slight shoulders may have
been formed only by grinding of the edges. If the shoulders
were not actually formed intentionally by chipping, it should
be classified as Milnesand. The shoulders in this case are
even less prominent than those of the specimen in Plate
18, K. This find occurred in a deep blowout in the sand
hills only a few inches from a rock-lined fire pit. Several
other fire pits can be observed in the blowout, and some
containing quantities of charcoal are still in place. However,
no inference concerning the association of the above point
and the fire pits can be made at this time. Much flint debris
lies scattered about the floor of this and neighboring blowouts, and other artifacts found represent more recent forms.
SUMMARY
During the late Pleistocene and early Recent epochs the
lush land surrounding the ancient lakes and ponds in what
is now Torrance County, New Mexico, was inhabited by
large mammals of species now extinct. It is no wonder

162

that man found this an ideal area in which t o camp and
hunt mammoth and bison. Evidence of these early hunters
is being found today as wind and modern drought lay bare
the ancient soil levels. The past presence of man is revealed
by his stone weapons and the skeletons of his prey scattered
about the exposed surfaces that extend inland from the
littoral zones of the ancient lakes. There is little doubt that
continued investigations in this area will make significant
contributions toward the solution of problems of Early Man
and his Pleistocene environment.

PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE BLOOM
MOUND, CHA YES COUNTY, NEW MEXICO
JANE HoLDEN

One pit house and one adobe-walled room were dug at
Bloom Mound during the 1954 field session of the Museum
of Texas Technological College. This work was done in
cooperation with the Roswell Archeological Society, which
had been working in the site for several years. This report
covers only the present excavation, as the materials obtained
previously were not available for study.
Bloom Mound is located approximately 12 miles westsouthwest of Roswell, New Mexico, at the base of the Sacramento Mountains, and on the north bank of Hondo River.
The approximate elevation is 3,775 feet (Fig. 6).
The artifacts will be discussed in the section dealing with
the room in which they were found. Room designations are
those of the Roswell Archeological Society. Pottery .types
will be dealt with separately.
ROOM F
This is a large, deep pit house, roughly 20 feet square
(Plate 21, A and Fig. 7, A). In the northwest corner, the
plastered wall is 7 feet high. This is only a few inches below
the surface at the present time; however, a blade was used
by the Society to remove overburden, so it is impossible
to say how much fill had accumulated over the old surface.
The pit house is at least 7 feet deep, as the plastered wall
is that high in the northwest corner. Most of this depth is
through silt and gravel, while the last 8 inches is through
a soft gypsum. The floor is exceedingly level, and consists
throughout of the gypsum.
The roof was undoubtedly supported by large beams
spanning the four central posts. Over these were pl;;tced
smaller poles. A heavy grass matting overlaid these poles.
In places, this matting remained 5 inches thick. The grass
was tied to the poles with what appears to be a yucca fibre
at intervals of about 12 inches. The whole was covered with

a heavy layer of clay. The roof must have been flat, and
almost on the same level as the ground outside, considering
the depth of the pit.
Four large central posts supported the roof. Each of these
post holes is 11 or 12 inches in diameter, and 14 to 16 inches
deep. These were dug into gypsum. Three of these posts
had been burned to the floor level; the wood has not been
definitely identified, but apparently pine was used for these
posts. An auxiliary post is located in the northwest corner;
it is not charred, and is standing to a height of 4 feet above
the floor.
A fire pit is centrally located. It is a cylindrical pit 12
inches deep and 12 inches in diameter, with a clay rim built
up 4 inches above the floor.
Just 12 inches east of the firepit is a pit dug into gypsum,
9 inches in diameter and 14 inches deep. Over this was a
perforated metate that had been plastered in place to form
the mouth of the pit. The metate is 20 inches long, lllf2
inches wide, and the opening is 41/2 inches by 5 inches.
Both sides of the metate had been well ground; the side
that showed the deepest grinding had been placed face
down.
One crudely chipped white chert projectile point was
found on the floor. A grey chert knife came from the same
location. This knife is oval in shape and shows rather careful
chipping on both sides.
A full-grooved maul or hammer came from above the
roof debris ; it measures 3Â¥2 inches long and 2 2/ 3 inches
wide at the base. Three metate fragments were found
stacked together on the floor against the north wall. They
were of the slab type. A small stone bead, 3fs inch in diameter,
and shaped like a doughnut, was found with four shell
beads. The four shell beads are flat discs. One had a diameter
of lf4 inch, while the other three measured 3/ 16 inch in
diameter.
Fragments of human bones occurred throughout the fill.

For instance, a charred mandible came from the area by
the west wall. Fragments of a baby skull came from just
above the floor in the southeast corner. A femur was close
to the fireplace.
There were two possible burials. Neither was articulated,
and both were very fragmentary. Both were in the fill above
the roof; they were on the same level, just 3 feet apart.
It is possible that this is a secondary disposal of the bodies,
judging from their confused positions.
One skeleton from the northeast section of the room
tells a tragic story. An adult male was apparently trying
to get out of the building while it burned. The upper part
of the body was on the top of the roof; the leg bones extended through the roof, and the right foot rested on the
floor.
ROOMG
This room is bounded by previously excavated rooms on
the south and east (Plate 21, B and Fig. 7, B). It is well
defined by hard adobe walls that are standing from 11 to
21 inches high. These walls are made of puddled adobe
that exhibits vertical cracks. These cracks may be a natural
result of drying adobe, or they may show the method used
to build the wall; that is, the adobe may have been molded
in sections at one time. The roofing clay and poles are close
to the surface. There was an unusual amount of charred
straw and reeds mixed with the roofing clay. The position
and condition of this straw would indicate that it was on
the inside of the room. A central post is the only interior
roof support. The room lacks a firepit of any sort.
A small Chupadero Black-on-white jug (Plate 22, C) was
found on the floor. There was apparently a wooden stopper
in the jug, but it was badly decayed. Inside the jug were
kernels of corn. Possibly this was corn that had been saved
for planting, as the amount is so small that it could hardly
have served as the bread of one meal. This small jug was

172

Texas Archeological Society

sitting on a charred bundle of grass that was tied tightly.
Possibly this was a broom (Plate 22, A).
A large Chupadero Black-on-white jug was also on the
floor. It had been broken by the fall of the roof. Inside
this jug was a large knife blade of dark red flint (Plate
22, G).
A small undecorated jar was likewise found on the floor
(Plate 22, D). The rim is like that of El Paso Polychrome,
as is the paste and wall thickness. This jar was resting on
a metate surrounded by charred straw.
A large olla of El Paso ware was near the west wall,
resting on a charred mat that is rather reminiscent of a
finely woven Mexican petate (See Plate 23, A for a fragment of the mat). It contained the following artifacts:
1. Two worked stones made from a slab of micaceous
schist. One is 4% inches long and 1 1/z inch wide. It is flat
and of uniform thickness of about 3/s inch. One edge is
ground to form a dull blade. Some red ochre adheres to
one surface. The other stone is not as finely ground, and
measures 3 inches long and 2 inches wide.

2. A scraper of translucent flint (Plate 23, C) .
3. A projectile point of brown flint (Plate 23, I) .
4. Miscellaneous unworked stones, identified as calcite
crystal and crystalline quartz; and four small brachiopods
which may be from localized microfauna in the San Andres
formation. These must have been picked up as curiosities.
5. Shell objects, including one fresh-water mollusk shell,
one Olivella bead, and one unfinished shell bead (the hole
was not drilled completely through).
6. Two worked bones (Plate 23, M) . These were probably
bound together with a reed mouthpiece to form a whistle.
7. A bone spatula lOYz inches long (Plate 22, F).
8. A second bone spatula, perhaps showing signs of working on one edge (Plate 22, E).

9. A hair ornament that has a carved base (Plate 23, N).
A large, heavily corrugated cooking pot was resting on
some basketry, close to the central post. This pot contained
no artifacts.
Two charred trays were flattened on the floor (Plate
22, B). Both were made by use of split coils over a fibre
bundle. (For a fragment of this type basketry, see Plate
23, B) . The size of these baskets cannot be given as they
are in the Roswell Museum.
Miscellaneous artifacts found scattered over the floor
include two projectile points. One is of black flint, about
1 inch long, side notched, slightly concave base (Plate 23, G) .
The other is too fragmentary to describe the type (Plate
23, H). The scrapers are made of random flint flakes (Plate
23, D, E) . A full-grooved stone axe is 6 inches long and
3% inches wide. It is made from cherty limestone.
A slab metate 10 inches wide and 22 inches long is from
the upper layer of the fill. Two metate fragments were
on the floor. One is a trough type, and it was in this metate that the small undecorated jar was sitting. The other
metate is too fragmentary to classify.
One small one-hand mano of quartzite was on the floor.
Another mano, 7% inches long, was present in the upper
layer.
Considering the abundance of material in this room, and
the fact that there is no fireplace, the obvious conclusion
is that this was a storage room.
POTTERY
The pottery from Bloom shows no clear-cut stratigraphic
difference between the deep pit house and the adobe surface structure. Hence, the statistics given here apply to the
total sherd count.

The majority of the pottery belongs to the brownware
complex. J ornado Brown is the most numerous, with El
Paso Polychrome being second numerically. Only one sherd
of J ornado Polychrome occurs, but this is to be expected,
as this form occurs in earlier sites.
A type of red-on-brown ware is present that is unfamiliar
to the author. The vessel form, rim form, and thickness of
the vessel wall are identical to those of El Paso Polychrome.
However, the paste is tan and lacks the extremely large
tempering particles so characteristic of the latter type. The
design consists of broad red bands. Possibly it is simply an
aberrant form of El Paso Polychrome, or possibly it is an
undescribed pottery. However, further evidence is needed
to establish it as a definite type.
Of the intrusive sherds, the Glaze I allows dating of the
site at 1350 to 1400 A.D. These sherds undoubtedly originated in the southern part of the Rio Grande Glaze area.
Gila Polychrome falls into the same period and is probably from eastern Arizona. St. Johns Polychrome likewise
falls within this time period and came from west-central
New Mexico.
Mimbres Black-on-white is found associated with this
ceramic complex in other sites in the area. This is thought
to be the latest appearance of Bold Faced Mimbres.

An unusual intrusive sherd is Santa Fe Black-on-white.
This is the first Santa Fe Black-on-white sherd to be identified from the immediate area. As the name indicates, this
sherd originated in the vicinity of Santa Fe.
FOOD
Animal bones are abundant in the site. In a superficial
survey, the following bones were identified: bison, deer,
antelope, rabbits, squirrels, and birds of several types.
Corn was abundant at the site. Records of the Roswell
Archeological Society list beans and squash as having been
identified. In Room G there was a charred pit of what has
been tentatively identified as cactus fruit (such as pitahaya
or tuna).
COPPER BELLS
Three copper bells were found in previous excavations
by the Roswell Archeological Society. This is thought to
be the easternmost occurrence of such bells.
SUMMARY
The eastern boundary of the sedentary dwellers of this
particular area of New Mexico seems to be the Pecos River.
No permanent villages are known east of the Pecos; instead,
the remains from the Pecos into the sand hills of west
Texas indicate nomadic camp sites. Judging from the pottery found in these camps (brown wares are the most common, with Chupadero Black-on-white and Glaze I red occurring not infrequently), the hunters originated in this
southern area of New Mexico. The presence of Glaze I in
many of these camp sites places their occupation in the
same time period as Bloom Mound and other sites.
Bloom Mound represents one of the easternmost sedentary
villages, as it is located close to the junction of the Hondo

l80 _____________T_e_x_a_s_A_r_c_h__e_
o_

g_ic_a_l_S_o_

~-------

and the Pecos rivers. The beginning date of the site is uncertain, but it is felt that it was slightly before 1300. The
presence of Glaze I and the absence of later glazes places
the terminal date close to 1450.
This period from 1300 to 1450 was a time of extensive
population expansion. There are numerous sites on all the
rivers between the Pecos and the mountains immediately
to the west that belong to this expansion period. Such a
site is the Bonnell Site, about 50 miles west of Bloom
Mound, reported by the author in this Bulletin, Vol. 23, pp.
78-132, 1952.
The population increase corresponds in part to a southern
movement of Pueblo IV peoples. Large pueblos do not extend as far south as Bloom Mound; rather, the last concentration of square pueblos (many containing up to 120
rooms) seems to be the Gallo and the Macho drainages.
The upper adobe-walled Room G is one of a double line
of rooms of a surface structure. The whole house may have
contained 12 rooms, of which six have been excavated.
The Pueblo IV peoples must have mixed with the local
builders of the deep pit house, as the Pueblo traits become
fused with those already existing in the Jornado area. The
pottery continues to be predominantly of the brownware
tradition, with an increasing number of intrusive sherds,
many stemming from the northern Pueblo area.
The deep pit house is thought to be earlier than the upper
adobe structure. Evidence to support this theory is the
presence of flood-borne gravel and silt that broke through
the west wall of the pit house. The adobe structure is built
above this flood deposit. Other clear-cut cases of an age
distinction between the two house types is lacking. Pottery
types remain nearly constant from all levels.

Preliminary Report on the. Bloom Mound

181

Two almost identical pit houses have been found at the
Bonnell Site. They are alike as regards size, floor features,
and quality of workmanship. The only unique feature of
Bloom Mound House F is the pit to the east of the fireplace
covered by a metate.
It is hoped that a full report can be written on this site,

using the materials obtained by the Roswell Archeological
Society. Because this appears to be a critical site in the
study of the Jornado area, it was deemed advisable to
publish this brief report. Our sincerest thanks are extended
to the Roswell Archeological Society, especially to Col.
Sayre, for cooperation in this endeavor.

EXCAVATIONS NEAR GRAN QUIVIRA,
NEW MEXICO
EARL GREEN

Part of the program of the 1954 field school operated by
The Museum, Texas Technological College, consisted of
general reconnaisance in the east-central New Mexico area.
The material considered in this report concerns a single
circular pit-house which was dug near the Gran Quivira
National Monument.
The site is approximately two miles northwest of the
Monument and is near the northern boundary of the Homer
Jackson ranch. There are no definite indications of prehistoric dwellings in this locality; however, a single pit-house
was discovered in pipe-line trenching operations in 1953
and was excavated under the direction of Dr. Fred Wendorf,
who also selected the spot where the pit-house described
here was found. In this case, the choice of locating a test
trench was based on a concentration of holes made by
burrowing animals.
DESCRIPTION OF PIT-HOUSE
The pit-house is almost perfectly circular and has a diameter of 15 feet with an average depth of 33 inches (Fig. 8).
A bench or strath was cleared off around the top of the
wall for a distance of 16 to 18 inches but there were no
indications of posts other than in the pit itself. The pit was
dug down into a thick caliche bed, and rough surfaces on
both the wall and floor were smoothed with clay plaster.
There were four large center post holes arranged in a
rectangular pattern, but the rectangle was not oriented
with the cardinal directions. In addition to the four large
center posts, there were several small holes around the
edge of the floor and a few holes placed horizontally in
the wall. Other than the location of the small holes at the
edge of the floor, no definite pattern could be ascertained.
The centrally located fire pit was roughly rectangular
in outline and had a built-up rim approximately 2 inches

above the general level of the floor which slopes centripetally from the wall. There was only a small quantity of
ash near and in the fire pit but the clay bottom and rim
were baked to a reddish-brown color.
During excavation of the room, potsherds were found
from the surface downward, with increasing frequency between the roofing material and the floor. The room had
not burned and none of the supporting posts were preserved; in fact, one of the striking features of the fill was
the absence of charred wood. Small particles of charcoal
did occur throughout the fill and were fairly common near
and on the floor. Other indications of fire were two large
pieces of burned roofing clay and one mass of charred
corn found near the floor.
MATERIAL CULTURE
Material culture from the circular pit-house was essentially limited to worked stone and potsherds, and is given
in two categories for stratigraphic purposes. The first group
includes all of the material from the surface down to the
top of the roofing clay, and the second group contains
materials from the fill between the roof and the floor.

AN HISTORIC BURIAL FROM YELLOWHOUSE
CANYON, LUBBOCK COUNTY
W. W. NEWCOMB,

JR.

In July, 1951, Betty Jane Dryden of Chickasha, Oklahoma,
a Girl Scout counselor, discovered some human bones eroding out of the north wall of Yellowhouse Canyon on the
Johnson Ranch below Buffalo Lake, about twelve miles east
of Lubbock, Texas (Plate 24, A, B). Her discovery was reported to Dr. Grayson E. Meade, Geologist at Texas Technological College, by Mary Ola Anderson, Field Director
of the Lubbock Girl Scout Association. Dr. Meade carefully removed the human remains, the revolver, knife, kettle, and the other cultural material associated with the
skeleton. These remains were given to the Texas Memorial
Museum and are now on exhibit on the Anthropology floor.
The skeleton is almost complete and is exceptionally well
preserved. The individual had been interred in the canyon
wall, lying on his back with knees drawn up (Plate 25, A ).
The right humerus (upper arm bone) and some bones of
the right hand and foot were missing. Being on the canyon
side of the burial these bones were washed away; other
bones were also exposed and led to the discovery. An examination of the skeleton indicated that the individual was
male, a young-adult (21-35 years old) and belonged to the
Indian (Mongoloid) division of mankind. The Indian char~cter of the skeleton is confirmed by the glass mocassin
beads, the tubular bone beads, and other Indian ornaments.
The. sex, acc()rding to the skeletal evidence, tends to be
confirmed by the fact that a revolver, knife, and saddle
bags were bliried with him. It is unlikely that this typically
male equippage would be buried with a woman. This individual was about 169.9 em. tall (or 5'7") and had a cranial
index of 75 (mesocephalic) . 1 Two views of the skull are
shown in Plate 25, B, C.

head breadth, 132 mm.; auricular height, 104 mm.; face height

55 mm. ; nose breadth, 27 mm.

An Historical Burial From Yellowhouse Canyon

187

Found with the skeleton was a Remington-Beals .44 caliber, cap and ball revolver, first manufactured in 1858, and
used by the United States Army (Plate 26, A). A metal cap
container was also found and fits into a fragmentary leather
pouch which was attached to the belt (Plate 26, E). The
metal belt buckle was well preserved, and is a General Service Army buckle, ordinarily worn by officers. This buckle
was first used in 1852 and until recently was worn on dress
uniforms.2 In a leather scabbard was found a badly rusted
and rotted, wooden handled, scalping or butcher knife (Plate
26, F) . Apparently a leather saddle bag had been placed over
or around the head. In a pouch of this bag was a small lump
of cinnabar (mercury ore) a red pigment much favored by
Indians for painting the face and body. This pigment was in
time deposited on the right temple and caused a red discoloration of the bone which is clearly visible today. On the
left temple is a greenish stain caused by contact of the
skl!ll with the copper or brass ornaments of the saddle
bag. Some coarse, black, typically Mongoloid hair, bound
by a cord, was also found adhering to the skull.
At the feet there were many small red, blue, and white
glass beads (Plate 25, E), and rusted cone-shaped iron tinklers (Plate 25, G), indicating that moccasins were worn.
Over the chest area were 88 nearly identical tubular bone
beads, about 2 inches long, which were worn as a breastplate consisting of four vertical rows of beads hung horizontally. Two such rows can be seen in place in Plate 25,
A, and 10 beads are seen in place on the remains of the cloth
shirt in Plate 26, D. These ornamental bone breastplates
were popular with Plains Indians in the 19th century, and
were ordinarily made from the small bones of front legs of
deer, or from turkey leg bones.
There were two ornaments cut out of sheet copper, like
that shown in Plate 27, B. The upper part is shaped somewhat like an inverted bell, while the lower part is a crescent.

The specimen not illustrated has the two parts joined with
a chain-like link. Probably these ornaments were suspended
from the bottom of the tubular-bone breastplate mentioned
above.
The remnants of a bridle were found, including parts of
the leather straps and metal ornaments (Plate 27, E-J), an
iron bit (Plate 26, B) , and the copper or brass-capped ends
of the bridle straps. At the foot of the grave and slightly
higher than the other remains was a two-quart Army issue
kettle of copper or brass (Plate 25, A). Several large disks
of thin sheet copper (Plate 27, A) were probably once fastened to the saddle bag. Small copper bells also were found
in the grave.
Many other bits of metal, leather, and cloth were found ,
too fragmentary to identify, although it may be supposed
that most of them once belonged to the clothing, bridle, and
saddle bag (Plates 25, F, H; 26, C; 27, C, D, K, L, N). A
copper ring was found in place around a finger bone (Plate
25,D).
An antler flaking tool (Plate 27, M) is of interest, for it
indicates that this person was still making chipped-stone
artifacts at this date.
ANALYSIS
We can say with certainty that this man died after 1858
from the data supplied by the revolver. It is unlikely that
he died later than about 1875, since the last of the tribes
in this area were pacified by this date. We cannot say what
caused death. There are no indications from the bones that
death was caused by an enemy missile or by disease. It
is of course possible to be killed by a bullet or arrow without having any bone affected. His death seems to have been
an honorable one in that burial was careful and apparently
unhurried. It seems unlikely that an ignominious death
would be rewarded with careful burial, particularly with
the inclusion of a fairly valuable, loaded revolver.

Several possibilities are raised by the Army equipment
found with the skeleton. First, is that this man was an
Indian Scout employed by the Army. The Army throughout the nineteenth century employed friendly Indians as
scouts, in exploring the west and dealing with its inhabitants. These scouts were equipped by the Army. Up to and
including the Civil War most of these scouts were members
of eastern tribes who had been forced onto reservations
west of the Mississippi. Shawnees, Delawares, and other
tribes originally resident in the east, and Pawnees, were
among the most prominent. Another possibility is that this
individual was a member of a hostile tribe, perhaps Comanche, Kiowa, or Apache. A warrior from one of these tribes
could have taken from a captive, or from the body of a
soldier, the revolver, belt-buckle, belt, and bridle, or he
could have 'received these items following a treaty or conference with government agents. Occasionally members of
these tribes served as scouts for the Army.
Several other clues suggest that the skeleton of Yellowhouse Canyon was a Comanche or a member of some other
southern Plains tribe. First, the nature of the burial suggests
this. Wallace and Hoebel say of the Comanches, for example:
The preferred burial place was a natural cave, crevice, or a deep wash among the rocks of the highest
accessible peak, or in the head of a canyon preferably to the west of the lodge of the departed3.
The Yellowhouse burial conforms to Comanche customs
in this respect and also in the habit of placing riding gear
and other personal valuables in the grave.4 Comanches
and Kiowas frequently shot the favorite horse of a warrior
over or near the grave, but if this occurred with the Yellowhouse burial the bones would probably have been scattered
or washed away. Second, the clothing and ornaments, par3. The Comanches, Lords of the South Plains, 1952, p. 150. University of Oklahoma Press .

ticularly the bone breastplate, point to a 19th century
southern Plains Indian. The area in which the burial was
found (just off the Llano Estacada) was well within the
19th century range of the southern Plains people, particularly the Comanches. Lastly, the 17 year period during
which this individual probably died was a most hectic and
destructive one for southern Plains tribes. This span covered the turbulent years of the Civil War and the violent
aftermath in which these people were hunted down and
the survivors finally confined to reservations. Many southern Plains Indians must have died and been buried in
situations similar to the one of Yellowhouse Canyon.
Unfortunately little is known, at least in detail, of the
distinguishing physical characteristics of the various southern Plains Indians, so that the tribal affinity of the Yellowhouse burial cannot be determined by a comparison of
relevant measurements. The southern Plains Indians also
underwent a good deal of racial mixture, particularly the
Comanche, so that tribal membership is not often reflected
in the skeletal evidence. Goldstein, who made an anthropometric study of the Comanches in the early 1930's, foui\d
that only 10 percent of the tribe were "fullbloods."5 Most
of the mixture can be traced to marriage with Mexican
captives beginning before the nineteenth century. There
were probably few "pure" Comanches left by the second
half of the century. Other southern Plains people probably
underwent a similar intermixture, although perhaps less
extensive than that of the Comanches.
In summary, the burial in Yellowhouse Canyon was that
of a young adult, male Indian. He was buried sometime
after 1858 and probably before 1875. It seems most likely
that this individual was a member of a southern Plains
tribe such as the Comanche or Kiowa, who had once worked
in some capacity for the Army, or had looted the Army
equipment found with him. It is also possible that the skele5. Goldstein, M. S., 1934, "Anthropometry of the Comanches,"
American Journal of Physical Anthropology, Vol. 19, p . 290 .

An Historical Burial From Yellowhouse Canyon

ton of Yellowhouse Canyon was a member of some other
Plains tribe, or a member of one of the Eastern Apache
groups. It seems somewhat less likely that he was a member
of one of the emigrant tribes of Indians.
It is rather curious that more historic burials similar to
the one of Yellowhouse Canyon have not been found or
at least reported. In the present instance it is true that
one of the reasons for the excellent state of preservation
is the fact that bone, leather, cloth, and hair, which lay
beneath the copper and brass ornaments, became impregnated with copper salts and so were preserved. On the
other hand, it may be that historic sites or burials are
considered to be of little importance and so are ignored.
This point of view, if true, is unfortunate, since one of the
largest gaps in our knowledge is the association of late prehistoric archaeological complexes with historic tribes. Particularly in Texas the association of historic tribes with
their archaeological forerunners is often all too weak. To
narrow and close this gap more early historic sites will
have to be examined. It is of course often true, as with the
Yellowhouse burial, that an historic site or burial does
nothing to illuminate the prehistoric of protohistoric knowledge of an area, but archaeological techniques of excavation and general analysis are frequently of immense value
in shedding light on the later history and ethnography of
an area.

AN HISTORIC INDIAN CACHE IN PECOS
COUNTY
N.

ETHIE EAGLETON

This article concerns a cache of very interesting material,
found in a rockshelter in eastern Pecos County by M. W.
Humphreys on August 1, 1954. This rockshelter is in Indian
Mesa about 200 yards west of the intersection of State Roads
305 and 1257, approximately 20 miles southeast of McCarney
and 10 miles west of Iraan. Indian Mesa itself is several
miles across, extending from the highway intersection westward to Tunis Creek, and northward to the Pecos River.
When climbing the eastern side of the Mesa, Mr. Humphreys sat down to rest and observed an iron axe lying near
the rock-shelter (Plate 28, C). He then noticed a pile of
rock near the axe, and on removing the rock found the
other objects to be described, which are now on display
in the Mendoza Trail Museum in McCarney.
The objects of bison hide described below were identified
by two ranchers, one of whom has run bison on her ranch
for 15 years. During World War II, they used bison meat
occasionally and dressed the hides. They say that the hides
from the cache are exceptionally well dressed .. The many
pieces of bison hide from the cache, not all of which are
illustrated, have been extensively chewed around their edges
by rodents, partly accounting for their odd shapes. The various kinds of skin pouches, however, have not been affected
much by rodent gnawing.
The photographs accompanying this article were made
in August, 1955, by Dr. Alex D. Krieger, archeologist of The
University of Texas. The following descriptions will be given
in the order in which the pictures are arranged. The objects
not photographed will then be briefly mentioned.
1. A fire-drill stick with lower end bluntly rounded and
charred (Plate 28, A). Length 24 inches; diameter 1 inch.

2. A leather strap, consisting of three sections sewed
together with thongs (Plate 28, B). The central section is

decorated on one side with lines, spurs, and circles, evidently
by pounding small screws into the leather, sideways and
head-down. Possibly made into a tump band out of scraps
of belts. Length 34 inches.
3. An iron axe with oak handle tightly fitted (Plate 28,
C). Total length 21 inches; blade 8 inches long.
4. Unbleached white cotton cloth (Plate 28, D). Length
572 yards; width 33 inches.
5. A paint bag made by cupping a piece of calico cloth
and gathering the edges together with a thong (Plate 29,
A). The calico is probably from the same dress as the sleeve
fragment in Plate 29, E. The bottom holds very finely powdered paint of a bright aquamarine color and a rounded
lump of the same material. 1
6. A paint bag of soft, finely dressed deerskin, sewed
with ocotillo fiber and bound around the neck with a thong
of the same material (Plate 29, B). This was filled with
bright red, finely powdered ochre.
7. A paint bag made by cupping a piece of thin deerskin
and gathering edges together, although no thong was present (Plate 29, C). This held a small quantity of powdered,
light cinnamon-brown ochre.
8. A paint bag of finely dressed deerskin, sewed with
ocotillo fiber and bound around neck with a thong (Plate
29, D). It is very similar to that in Plate 29, B, but ragged
at the top and torn or gnawed at the bottom. It contained
remnants of powdered yellow ochre or limonite.
9. Part of the sleeve of calico dress (Plate 29, E) . This
could have been used as a pouch by tying both ends, but
contained nothing when found.
1. Dr. Stephen E. Clabaugh, Professor of Geology, University
of Texas, has identified this peculiar aquamarine paint as a very
finely powdered m ixture of minute green needles of a silicate,
possibly hornblende, and a small proportion of calcite crystals.
He states that these materials could have been obtained in the
mountainous areas of Trans-Pecos Texas.

10. A piece of very soft deerskin with edges twisted into
several long extensions (Plate 29, F) . This could also have
served for carrying something by tying the extensions over
a bundle, but was empty when found.
11. A pouch made by doubling a long rectangle of rather
heavy bison skin, then sewing it with ocotillo fiber around
three edges, except for a small opening at one corner (Plate
30, A). This was well filled with uniformly pulverized tobacco of the right consistency for smoking (see sample
above letter "A").
12. A pouch of dressed but stiff and crinkled antelope
skin, made by doubling an approximately square piece of
skin, then sewing with ocotillo fiber along two sides and
leaving most of the third side open (Plate 30, B) . This was
about half full of twist tobacco, the leaves being very tightly
wadded together (see samples next to open end of pouch,
above letter "B").
13. A pouch of bison skin (Plate 30, C), made as follows :
A long rectangle of skin was folded so that one end reached
only about two-thirds as far as the other. The edges were
then sewed together along the sides, and part way across
the place where the short end rested against the longer one,
leaving a gap of unknown length as an opening into the
pouch. The longer end was left extending beyond the transverse sewing, as a flap. Finally, a deerskin thong was fastened to the corners of the sewed part, as a sling for carrying
the p ouch. In the photograph, the original fold in the rectangle of skin forms the bottom of the pouch, the thong
loop is arranged around the flap which extends beyond the
transverse sewing, and a small part of the transverse sewing
appears to the left of the thong fastening at the upper right
corner. The triangular gap is the result of rodent gnawing,
which probably began at the open corner of the pouch, destroying part of the two upper edges of the pouch, some of
the transverse sewing, and part of the flap . This pouch wa's
about half full of partly pulverized vegetal material which
was thought to be "Indian tea" (see sample above letter

An Historic Indian Cache in Pecos County

215

"C"). It has now been identified as consisting mainly of
leaves and seeds of the ground cherry, an Indian medicinal
plant.2
14. A split and beveled section of bison cannon bone,
partly articulated with a foot bone, which probably served
as a hide scraper (Plate 31, A). The scraping marks on some
hides in the cache (Plate 32, A, B) may well have been done
with such an implement.
15. Two lengths of deerskin rope, each consisting of two
strips of skin twisted counter-clockwise (Plate 31, B shows
one) . Lengths 51 and 45 inches.
16. Part of a large skin bag, very soft and flexible, probably bison skin (Plate 31, C) . Although much of this bag
is torn or gnawed, two edges are still sewed with skin thongs.
A neatly made, round patch may be seen at one place, and
in the upper central part, a tear had been repaired with
thong sewing. Although this bag is somewhat like the common Plains Indian parfleche, it has no signs of painted decoration.
17. A corner fragment of another bag, very similar in
softness and flexibility to that in Plate 31, C, which was
stuffed with hair (Plate 31, D). This also has remains of
thong-sewed edges and a neat patch, but it must have been
torn before the cache was made, as the hair just filled it.
Most of this hair is from a black and white "paint" horse,
cut into hanks with a knife. One handful, however, is considerably finer in texture, softer, black, and may be human
hair (see mass to right of letter "D").
18. Two thick pieces of bison hide, both folded double and
dried or hardened in that position (Plate 32, A, B). The
straight edges have been cut; the irregular edges are gnawed.
Both pieces were completely de-haired and bear numerous

Botany, University of Texas. The ground cherry is of the family
Solanaceae, genus probably Physalis. There were also some grass
blades in the sample studied by Dr. Turner.

parallel grooves across their surfaces, made by a scraping
tool. These are particularly apparent on the lower half of
Plate 32, B, and may have been caused by a bone tool such as
that in Plate 31, A. Loops remain at the upper edges which
were made when the hides were staked out for drying and
scraping.
19. A large piece of bison hide, also thick, stiff, and
folded double (Plate 32, C) . The edges have been extensively
gnawed, resulting in a long, narrow extension on one side
which was twisted back when the photograph .was made.
A few hairs are left on this hide, but it bears scraping marks
like those in Plate 32, A, B. A stake loop appears at the left
edge, while possible wound holes appear near the center
of the picture and at the upper right edge.
20. A large but very thin, soft bison skin with patche:;:
of dark brown hair remaining (Plate 33, A). Parts of this
skin were folded under the main part when the photograph
was made. Extended, it is about 67 by 35 inches, although
the edges have been gnawed back extensively. While still
covered with fur, such a skin would have made a good robe
or blanket because of its thinness and light weight.
21. A very thick, stiff, and warped bison hide still bearing reddish hair (Plate 33, B). Although its thickness is
about 1h inch, the reddish hair suggests it was a calf. Like
the other pieces of hide, the edges have been gnawed considerably by rodents, but it now measures about 24 by 36
i.nches.
The following objects are not illustrated :
22. A piece of dressed bison skin so curled it was not
possible to get a focus on it, about 55 by 20 inches.
23. Two pieces of bison skin with some hair remaining,
about 20 by 6 inches and 12 by 11 inches.
24. Another bison calf skin with reddish hair, about,. 43
by 12 inches.

An Historic Indian Cache in Pecos County

217

25. Four bison skins, approximately 18 by 21 inches, cut
somewhat in the shape of saddles for burros, although their
shape may be partly due to rodent gnawing.
26. Other pieces of dressed bison skin of various sizes.
27.

A pair of grass shears about 20 inches long.

28. A bison skin pouch of gunpowder about 10 inches in
diameter.Â·Â·
29. Lead for musket balls, several chunks about one-third
the size of a teacup.
30. A deerskin pouch about 6 inches in diameter, with
shell and stone ornaments, possibly charms.
There was no sign of a burial with this cache. Probably
the objects had been stored with the intention of coming
back to them sometime. The calico cloth belongs to the Civil
War period and the cache may be supposed to date at about
that time or a little later.
Both the Comanches and Lipan Apaches roamed this area
in historic times. During the 19th century, however, the

Comanches had for ced the Lipans farther and farther south,
toward the Big Bend and into northern Mexico, so that by
the time of the Civil War the Comanches were probably
the only Indians to occupy Pecos County. For this reason,
the cache was likely deposited by a Comanche, although this
cannot be proved.

A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE ALBERT
GEORGE SITE IN FORT BEND COUNTY
RAYMOND WALLEY

This article will deal with some of the more interesting
findings at the Albert George Site, and particularly with
a cache of bone artifacts found in probable association with
two skeletons.
The Albert George Site is one of several known to the
writer along Big Creek, a tributary of Brazos River, in
southern Fort Bend County (Fig. 9). This general locality
is on the coastal plain of Texas, about 35 to 40 miles inland
from the Brazos River mouth, 50 miles due west of Galveston, and 25 miles southwest of Houston. Before clearing,
the area was heavily wooded with such trees as elm, ash,
hackberry, ironwood, and live oak mixed with shrubs and
vines.
There was sporadic digging in the Albert George Site by
early settlers looking for gold. Many years after these
settlers had moved and the site forgotten, it was re-discovered by a hunter whose dog had scratched out a flint
knife. The hunter then dug quite a lot in the area, but as
he reported that "nothing but old Indian bones" had been
found, interest was lost until I heard the story in 1951 and
attempted to re-locate the site.
In December, 1951, the combination campsite, burial
ground, and midden was found. Three burials were dis:.
covered at that time. One was that of a female about 16
years old, semi-flexed on the right side. On each side of
the skull there was a small, pointed pendant made from
the columnella of a conch shell. These pendants are a
matched pair between 7 and 7.5 em. long, each with a small
hole at one end (Plate 36, I, J), and diameter of about 1.5
em. They are similar to a shell pendant from the Crooks
Site in east-central Louisiana.1

Texas ArcheoLogicaL Society

In 1954 a group of amateur archeologists from the Brazosport area again visited the site after it was learned that
clearing of the creek banks on both sides by bulldozer had
resulted in the trees and brush being pushed back at least
100 feet (Plate 34, A). It was impossible to find the exact
location of the previous work, but an undisturbed area approximately 40 by 20 feet was found at the highest part of
the site. At the center of this area, eight plots each 5 feet
square were laid out and numbered from I to VIII (Plate
34, B).

An east-west base line was run through the center of
this area, and four plots were staked out to the north and
to the south of the base line. The square at the southwest
corner was called plot I and those running to the east called
plots II, III, and IV. The square at the northwest corner
was plot V and those running east from it became plots VI,
VII, and VIII. Only two of these plots proved of little value.
Plot I contained two deer cannon-bone awls and what was
thought to be bison teeth. Plot V contained only deer bones,
shells, and occasional potsherds.
Each of the other plots yielded at least two, and some as
many as four, burials. It appears that in some instances,
and possibly in all, some material was purposely buried with
the dead. For example, in one case, six well made projectile points were found very near a skeleton. The skeletal
material was very fragmentary in most cases, and difficult
to excavate in the dense, hard black clay. In a nearby plot,
Richard Worthington excavated two elliptical bone objects
about 5 inches in diameter, along with bone awls and chipped-flint artifacts.
Plot VII contained at least four burials. One was extended with the legs crossed. In the same plot was found a
"killed" boatstone or atlatl weight of green granite. The
fragments fitted together to make a complete, beau tifully
shaped boatstone 96 mm. long (Plates 36, K; 37, C) . It is
well shaped and polished over the whole surface, including
the deep trough in th e upper side. The sides pinch together

toward the middle of the top or troughed side, so that the
width of the top is greater at the ends than it is in the middle. In the same plot, a number of awl-like bone tools were
found near the skull of the extended burial, although they
could not positively be associated with it. Possibly these
awl-like artifacts (not illustrated) were hair fasteners .
CACHE OF BONE IMPLEMENTS
In plot VIII a skull was uncovered 18 inches below the
surface. In contact with it and slightly lower was a second
skull (Plate 35, A). Limb bones were found nearby which
probably belonged with one of these skulls (Plate 35, B) .
About one foot in front of the first skull was a cache of bone
artifacts, most of them fragmentary, but a few complete or
nearly so. These bones were criss-crossed and tightly matted
together in the very hard clay, so that it was impossible to
remove them all intact (Plate 35, C) . Most of these objects
had been badly broken by roots and we were fortunate in
getting most of them out without further damage. The
cache lay between 12 and 18 inches deep and its proximity
to the two skulls suggested it was associated with at least
one of them. Whether the two skulls belonged to a double
burial, or to separate interments, could not be determined.
Plate 36, A-H shows the eight most complete implements
from this cache. The first two specimens are shown enlarged in Plate 37, A, B. In Plate 38, most of the remaining
fragmentary specimens are shown, laid in rows which are
labeled A to L . The pieces in each row are not necessarily
from the same implements, although in some cases they are.
The 44 fragments in Plate 38, added to the eight specimens
in Plate 36, gives a total of 52 bone objects from this cache.
These 44 fragments appear to come from at least 18 different artifacts, which gives a minimum of 26 implements.
possibly the actual total is between 30 and 35.
The great majority of these implements are probably
made from bison cannon bone, split lengthwise. They are
fairly flat, except for the gently convex outer surface of
the bone, although a few are rather round in cross-section:
It may be supposed that the flat implements (those in P late

234

36, A-H, and some of those in Plate 38) were used as awls

in weaving such things as plaited mats or baskets. Rounded
tips, such as those in rows C, E, and H in Plate 38 suggest
flaking tools. The slender pin with flanged head and round
cross-section in row G, Plate 38, may have had a distinct
function, perhaps that of a hair fastener. At any rate, a
variety of uses is indicated by the cache as a whole.
It may be noted that the flat implements are both plain
and neatly incised with geometric designs on the outer or
convex surface. Eyes appear at the head of both plain and
decorated implements, and on both flat and rounded forms,
although the majority are not eyed. Plate 36, G has tiny
dots alongside the sets of parallel diagonal lines. In a general way, the incised decorations, including dots, are similar
to those found on the rim zone of pottery vessels of the type
Goose Creek Incised.2 Potsherds from this site also belong
to Goose Creek ware, from which an affiliation with the
Galveston Bay Focus may be assumed for at least part of
the site.3

Examples of projectile points, a snub-nosed scraper, and
a knife from this site are shown in Plate 39. Sandstone
hones have also been found.
As all of our time after finding the cache was devoted to
removing it, we decided to search for additional burials at
a later date. Meanwhile, the creek bed was dug out and
about 20 feet of dirt was piled on top of the site. This was
leveled again, and about 3 feet of dirt now covers it. If
sufficient interest justifies it, the original plots can be relocated by use of our many photographs which show their
relation to the trees in the background.

RESEARCH IN EAST TEXAS PROJECTILE
POINTS
E. W.HAYNER
When the Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology
came out, a means was at hand whereby a person could go
into the field, and with a reasonable degree of success, place
different kinds of projectile points into recognized types.
With the limited amount of work that has been done in
East Texas as a guide, and four years experience by the
writer in a close study of native Indian artifacts, camp sites,
village sites, and mounds, the need for a survey of projectile
points in East Texas was clearly indicated.
When the decision to make a survey of projectile-point
types was reached, various problems arose to show that a
survey was both complicated and difficult. In order to get
a truly representative group of points, it would be necessary
to find a collection made within a given, limited area,
either by one person or by one person with the help of his
family, because different people have different ideas about
what should and should not be collected. Also, such a group
of artifacts must exclude specimens from other areas or
states, and no collection should be used which has had any
of the larger or more attractive specimens sold out of it.
Much thought and careful planning was given to the
preparation of this survey. One purpose was to see if any
particular types would prevail over East Texas. Then the
area to be covered had to be defined. It was decided to
begin the survey in Cass, Marion, Morris, Upshur, Gregg,
Harrison, and Panola counties, as they lie in about the cen.ter
of the Caddo Indian habitation area of East Texas. Also, it
was thought that if one good collection could be found in
each of these counties, which contained 100 or more projectile points, the percentages of these points could be cal-

236

Texas Archeological Society

culated. A suitable collection was found in each of the
counties named, except Panola and Gregg, and two were
found in Harrison County.
At the beginning of the survey, a time limit of one day
was allowed for each county. This schedule proved to be
way off in the time that was actually consumed. A whole
day can be used up just in locating a collection, only to find
that it has been sold, or that the best and most attractive
specimens have been sold, stolen, or given away. It was patience-breaking at times to find so many fine artifacts that
were completely useless for this survey. Many days, many
dollars, and many hundreds of miles were consumed, but
in all fairness, it must be said that the results were worth
the cost.
Before beginning, a trip was made to Dallas to compare
certain types with Wilson W. Crook, Jr. A few points of the
Carrollton and Elam types are found in East Texas, and
there was need to be sure that these are like those found in
the Trinity River terraces. It was seen that specimens from
East Texas and the Dallas area classified as Carrollton and
Elam are indeed of the same shape, flaking, and stem
grinding.
A trip was also made to Shreveport, Louisiana, to confer
with Dr. Clarence H. Webb about the Bulverde type of
point, and mutual agreement reached on how to identify it.
CANNON COLLECTION
The collection of A. D. Cannon of Atlanta, Texas, is from
the vicinity of Atlanta in Cass County. Mr. Cannon is a
farmer and most of his artifacts have been recovered on
the surface while plowing, or exposed by rain erosion. He
has four of the Pogo spear or lance points from a shallow

In addition, there were 14 points which could not be classified or were of unique design. The Almagre points in this
and the other collections studied might be classified as
Gary except for their crude workmanship and slight shoulders. The Paisano and Desmuke points may be of questionable identification because these types properly belong
in western and southern Texas, respectively. According to
the Handbook, the San Patrice type of East Texas and
Louisiana may sometimes be confused with Paisano, and
the Desmuke type may at times be hard to distinguish from
Abasolo, which is much more general in Texas.
The presence of 14 Williams, 21 Ellis, and 18 Edgewood
points in a collection this size is out of the ordinary. Ellis
and Edgewood are similar except that Edgewood points are
somewhat larger than Ellis, the bases are broader and concave, and they are usually made of different materials. In
every collection examined, the Ellis points stand out in
superior workmanship, as they are usually made of flint,
while other types are of cherts, quartzite, novaculite, petrified wood, etc., as well as flint. The 11 Bulverde points in
this collection are of a wide variety of materials and are
rather crude in workmanship.

239

An outstanding feature of this collection is the considerable use made of novaculite for Gary and Bulverde points.
Fully 90 per cent of the specimens in these two types are
made of a dark brown novaculite which must have been
brought into this area from western Arkansas or eastern
Oklahoma, as it does not occur naturally in Texas.
The point identified as Denton Nub Stemmed in this collection is the only one encountered by the writer in East
Texas.
KENNEDY COLLECTION
The collection of W. C. Kennedy of Gladewater, Texas,
was recovered from about the whole of Upshur County,
with a few specimens from Camp County. Mr. Kennedy
and his wife have collected for about 20 years, entirely
from the surface of cultivated land. This collection contains 1,123 whole projectile points and several hundred fragments. Those typed by the writer gave the following totals:

When this collection was first seen, so many points appeared to be of the Bulverde type that a trip was made to
Shreveport to consult Dr. Webb, taking several of the points
along. It was agreed that they are of the Bulverde type.
A trip was made to Jefferson, Texas, to have the lithic
materials identified by Mr. David Flesh, who is a geologist
and mineralogist. As in the Howell collection, it was found
that large numbers of points of the Gary and Bulverde types
in the Kennedy collection are made of novaculite. Thanks

are due to Mr. Flesh for making this identification under
a microscope.
As the specimens in this collection were wired to display
boards nailed to the walls of Mr. Kennedy's den, identification of types was very time-consuming. Therefore only the
most distinctive types were tabulated and the others passed
up. This collection will certainly bear closer investigation.
It should be pointed out that about 450 points in this collection are very conspicuous for their rough workmanship,
but this only adds to its interest, for it shows that Mr. Kennedy did not discard the more poorly-made objects in favor
of the best, as so many other collectors do. It is important
to note, too, that Mr. Kennedy has saved broken as well as
whole artifacts.
LOOMIS COLLECTION
The collection of R. A. Loomis of Jefferson, Texas, was
made in the vicinity of Kellyville, about six miles west of
Jefferson, in Marion County. All points were recovered
from farm land by negro farm hands, who sold or traded
them to Mr. Loomis while he was a merchant in Kellyville.

There were about 250 more points in this collection that
could not be definitely classified, due to poor material and
workmanship. The Clovis and Scottsbluff points would be
outstanding in any collection. The Meserve points all appear to have been rechipped from Clovis points, as the remains of previous flutings may be seen on them.
The Gary, Lange, Ellis, and Wells points are of generally
poor workmanship, but the Yarbrough examples are of excellent quality. The Bulverde are about average. The collection also contains about 30 specimens of unique shapes
and excellent pressure flaking.
LUTHER COLLECTION
The collection of Mrs. Charles Luther of Karnack, Texas,
was made in an area between Karnack and Caddo Lake in
Harrison County. It was collected from farm land by farm

Many more specimens in this collection are of uncertain

type encountered in the survey. They were taken to Dallas
for a comparison with Carrollton points recovered from terraces of the Trinity River by the Dallas Archeological Society. Mr. Wilson W. Crook, Jr., considered the points from
near Caddo Lake to be the same type as those from the
Dallas area.

LENTZ COLLECTION

One feature of interest in this collection is that it contains
30 points of Pleistocene types from one farm. The Clovis,
Plainview, and Scottsbluff types are represented by five
specimens each, and the 15 Meserve points seem to have
been reworked from original Clovis and Plainview points.
Also, the Gary, Kent, and Palmillas points stand out in
that they are almost all of brown chert, and they are the
only types in this collection that are almost 100 per cent of
this material. The Palmillas points present a problem in
that their small, bulb-shaped stems grade off into stems like
those of the Kent and Gary types. There is an Archaic site
within 50 yards of the writer's camp on the shore of Caddo
Lake, also in Harrison County. This site yields flakes,
burned rock, a hammerstone, and three Palmillas points of
brown chert which would fit with ease into the Lentz group.
Of the 50 Bulverde points in this collection, four or five are

of the same material used for this type in Upshur, Camp, and
Morris counties, and perhaps they were made by the same
people that lived in that area.
The village site from which this collection was made
covers several acres. On the surface there are many potsherds belonging to the Fulton Aspect. There is a real problem in deciding which of the projectile-point types should
be associated with Caddo Indians of the Fulton Aspect and
which are Archaic. The Pleistocene types must be older
than any of the others.
CONCLUSIONS
For the man who is fortunate enough to make a survey
of this kind, there is much pleasure and it is an unforgettable experience. Most people are not able to envision, and
will not have the chance to see, the wide variety of materials from which Indian proj ectile points were made. Also,
few people realize what great variety of form and workmanship there is, or can be, within a certain type. This
variety and overlapping is readily apparent when collection;:; from different counties are inspected.
One of the original purposes of this survey was to see
what types of projectile points predominate in East Texas
counties. The tabulations above show that the Gary type is
most frequent in five of the collections studied, but outside
of that, the proportions between types vary greatly from
one collection to another.

EDITOR'S NOTE: One of the aims of the Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology was to encourage amateur archeologists
to identify types of projectile points and pottery, then tabulate
their frequencies by sites or by limited areas. Although I have
had no opportunity to see the specimens studied by Mr. Hayner,
and would probably differ from him on some of the identifications, I feel that he is to be congratulated on being the first member of this Society to make and report on a survey of this kind.
He plans to extend his studies in future articles. (ADK).

ANOTHER PUEBLOAN TRADE SHERD
IN EAST TEXAS
E.

w. HAYNER

Five potsherds representing trade from the Puebloan
Indians of the Southwest to the Caddo of East Texas have
previously been described. 1 They were found in Lamar,
Red River, Cass, Franklin, and Shelby counties. The one
farthest east, a sherd of Chupadero Black-on-white originating in eastern New Mexico, was found in Shelby County,
about 30 miles west of the Louisiana border. The other
four were of types originating farther west, in the Upper
Gila area of western New Mexico, although these types
may have spread more widely over southern New Mexico
before trade with the Caddo Indians began. In New Mexico.
all five sherds would fall within the general period of 1200
to 1500 A. D. In East Texas, three of the five , including the
Chupadero, came from sites assigned to the Titus Focus.
Fulton Aspect, but the association of the other two was not
determined. The Titus Focus has also been estimated to
have existed during part or all of the time between 1200
and 1500 A. D.
This report deals with a sixth Puebloan trade sherd in
the Caddo area. It was found in the spring of 1951, catalogued as No. 4-L.3, and placed in storage, where it remained
until May, 1955, when Dr. Krieger briefly visited my base
camp on Caddo Lake. He became very interested in this
sherd, thinking it might be from the Pueblo culture. and
that if so, it would be farther east than any of the others.
It was Krieger's suggestion that the sherd should be sent
first to Dr. James B. Griffin, director of the Ceramic Repository of the University of Michigan, to see whether it
might belong to any known type in the Eastern United
States. However, Dr. Griffin was unable to identify it.
Krieger then suggested I send it to Mr. Stanley Stubbs,

Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, New Mexico, a noted
authority on Southwestern pottery types. Fortunately,
Stubbs was able to report on it as follows:
"After comparing your sherd with many examples in
our collections, I would be inclined to place it as coming
from central Arizona in the general Salt River-Tonto
Creek area. The type is variously named, but fits in the
Mogollon brownware series, often called 'undifferentiated
brownware'. The only trouble is that the series covers a
rather long time span-at least 500 years-and regional
extensions. It would be difficult to pin it down to any
exact date. Your sherd has a little better finish than the
average from the Tonto area, but it is not extreme. It
was finished by the paddle-and-anvil method, and the
temper is also characteristic of many of the brownware
specimens from that area. My guess is: this sherd is
Mogollon brownware from the Tonto area of Arizona.
Charlie Steen of the National Park Service office in Santa
Fe, who has done considerable work in that region, also
feels that the sherd is Mogollon." (Letter received in October, 1955).
The sherd is shown full size in Plate 40. It measures
em. long, 8 em. wide, and 1.4 em. thick. It was found on
archeological site on the south shore of Caddo Lake,
land formerly owned by the writer and now owned
Curtis Roark.

The site is in Harrison County, about two miles from the
Louisiana border. The Mogollon sherd is therefore farther
east than any of the five described by Krieger, and its source
area is also farther west, in Arizona rather than New Mexico. The straight-line distance between Caddo Lake and the
Tonto basin is between 950 and 1,000 miles, but any practicable route of travel between the two areas would have
been at least 1,200 miles. This is a long way for Indian trade
goods to travel. However, the writer has a celt found in
East Texas which is made of basalt granite which occurs at

only two places in the United States: in Idaho and Massachusetts.
The site from which the Mogollon sherd came is a small
sandy "pimple mound" about 150 yards from the present
shore of the lake. It has so far yielded only five other
artifacts: a pitstone of brown flint; a combined mano and
pitstone of native sandstone; a mano of gray granite; and a
small square block of native sandstone with a groove cut
around it by which it could have been hafted and used as
a weapon. The site has not yet produced any flint chips or
other pottery, which indicates it might belong to the Archaic Stage. However, it has not been completely explored .
If this site is really Archaic, we may be wrong in supposing the Mogollon sherd was traded to the Caddo Indians,
for Caddoan culture in East Texas can only be proved with
the appearance of pottery and other distinctive artifacts of
the Gibson and Fulton Aspects. It must be pointed out that
only a quarter of a mile south of this site there is a large
mound which does have Fulton Aspect pottery on its top.
It may be possible that pre-Caddoan people brought trade
material into East Texas from the Southwest, but as of this
date this question cannot be definitely answered.

SURFACE POINTS FROM THE BADLANDS OF
THE UPPER WESTERN CROSS TIMBERS
OF TEXAS
ADOLPH HENRY WITTE

The Western Cross Timbers extend in a narrow belt from
the Brazos River northward across Red River and into Oklahoma. The width is variable; it is less than 20 miles in
the vicinity of Red River. The terrain, to a depth of several
hundred feet is sandy with erratic clay seams and gravel
concentrations. These are the well known Trinity Sands,
named by Dr. R. T. Hill. They once were also known as the
Dinosaur Sands. Wieland, the paleobotanist said in describing their Early Cretaceous Age: "The Trinity was a flat,
subsident river and bayou, Cycad-Dinosaur-Conifer Forest
land swept by the edges of the sea."
The following Texas counties lie more or less within the
upper Western Cross Timbers: Clay, Jack, Montague, Cook,
Wise, Parker, Hood, Somervell, and Palo Pinto. In the 1850's
the region was covered by an open, scattered hardwood
forest according to reports of the first American settlers.
One informant was of the firm opinion that the Indians purposely set fire to the grass and underbrush at regular intervals and this accounted for the "open" condition of the
timber.
The following historical notes from various apparently
authentic sources establish some of the final dates when
Indians were known to have been in the area. From one
narrative, Henry Braden was perhaps the first white man
to settle permanently. He built a log cabin on Denton Creek
in 1854. It has been reported that other settlers arrived the
same year.
The Butterfield Stage came along with the first passengers in 1858 and established a station near Queen's Peak.
Sul Ross fought the Comanches in 1860 on Mule Creek, near
the Pease River. Also in the same year, a wagon train under
the direction of Dr. Albert Eldridge arrived in Montague
village. This band of settlers was bound for the Little Wichita

250

River to the west and planned a settlement. They were
warned positively not to continue. The Indians were exceedingly hostile to the west. Disregarding the information,
they continued westward. Disaster soon followed as several
members of the little party were murdered by Indians. The
remnant of the party was forced to return eastward. In 1872,
after the Civil War, Dr. Albert Eldridge and party returned
and established residence within the area as planned in 1860.
In 1866, Bianca Babb, age 13, her brother Dot Babb, 15, and
Mrs. Luster were seized by the Comanches, 12 miles west
of present-day Decatur. The mother, Mrs. JohnS. Babb was
murdered on the spot. A Kiowa Chief, White Horse, was
tried in the District Court in Henrietta by Judge Lindsey
of Gainsville in 1874. White Horse was accused of murdering
a settler by the name of Koozier and taking his wife and
children to the Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma. The verdict of the court is not known to this writer. Years later,
on April 13, 1879 a small wagon train was attacked in Hardeman County and Joseph Earle was murdered and scalped
by a band of Kiowas. The Indians definitely did not leave
this part of the state without a lot of resistance and bloodshed.
Here in brief is the next cycle of events involving the
frontier settlers of the Upper Cross Timbers. Unrestricted
hunting soon removed almost all of the vast herds of deer
and other wildlife. The plow and overgrazing largely destroyed the lavish grasses and plantlife which protected
the unstable soils from erosion. Soil conservation practices
as we know them were not practiced and this speeded the
terrible, creeping erosion. Geologically, the whole area is
"wrong" and was never suitable for cultivation except in
limited patches. During the less than one hundred years of
cultivation, fantastic and unbelievable badlands formed
across thousands of acres of cultivated lands. Gulleys with
sheer vertical walls, 50 to 100 feet in depth became common~
place. The end result of the ever spreading, coalescing, bad~
land topography was ruin and poverty for the settlers and
their civilization. Wholesale abandonment of the farms came

next. At present abandoned homes, farms , and ghost towns
are to be seen throughout the area.
As could be expected, many, many archeological resources
were destroyed and uncovered by this enormous erosional
cycle. The writer has long been interested in just what
might be salvaged from these badlands. Intermittent explorations for a number of years resulted in a considerable
collection of flint artifacts. An analysis of types found include about 50 points belonging to the Paleo-American Stage
(Plate 41 , A-L) . These possibly are Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Angostura, and some obviously reworked specimens
which seem to fall into the Meserve category.1
The highly eroded ridges between valleys seem to be the
best place to search for Paleo-American artifacts. Dissected
stream terraces are the next best bet. All the points found
were on the surface and no concentrations were observed.
Fluted points, largely incomplete, are fairly common. Some
of these have only short lengthwise flakes removed from
each face. In my past experience, short flutes are not typical
of the High Plains Folsom points, but rather of the larger
Clovis type. Poor grades of chert and even quartzite were
utilized at times in the Trinity Sand area. This might be
the explanation rather than lack of skill, as some archeologists have suggested. A number of fossil elephant remains
were found. In the future, in situ finds in association with
typical fauna of the Clovis or Folsom periods can be expected.
Complete Scottsbluff points are rare. Some incomplete
fragments might well belong.
Where sand dunes of appreciable geological age have been
examined, they usually contain traces of Indian occupation.
No complete artifacts were found in these ancient dunes.
One large sandy stream terrace on Farmer's Creek proved

far as could be determined, with those used by Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks (1954).

in the valley. A series of dart points and arrowheads w as
collected from the plowed surface. Certain artifacts are of
common types found elsewhere in Texas. Especially common are Gary, Darl, Ellis, Elam, Carrollton, and a Pedernales point or two. One incomplete fluted point comes from
this Farmer's Creek terrace. Another fluted point was reworked into a Pedernales.
Projectile-point types of the Henrietta Focus are common :
Harrell, Hayes, Fresno, Bonham and overlapping forms.
No pottery has been found. However, Nocona Plain invariably is found in Henrietta Focus sites. No doubt it was overlooked here. Gary points usually show up on the surface
of middens where Henrietta Focus items are concentrated.
While the association is persistent, they are not found in
large numbers. Gary points also have been found in considerable numbers on the surface of sites within the Trinity
River drainage in Wise and Montague Counties. Henrietta
Focus items are almost nonexistent in that immediate area.
Returning to the Farmer's Creek terrace in the Red River
drainage pattern, near the west end of the site a handful
of extremely small arrowheads was picked up. These little
creations in stone represent about the extreme that could
be accomplished in flaking and notching (Plate 41, M).
They may be reworked Harrell points. Items of this type
have been collected in certain sites in the Little Wichita
River drainage. Likely, in this area, they are traces of a
small group of Indians who briefly occupied in late times
some of the same sites as did the Henrietta Focus people.
Various types of core tools have been noted. These include
choppers, large and small, turtleback scrapers, gouges, and
scrapers of many other shapes and sizes. Thick, leaf-shaped
points without notches, and numerous utilized flakes, spalls,
etc., have also been found .
Flint resources were ample in the Trinity Sand region.
They include a fine white sugar-like conglomerate from the
base of the sands, also chalcedony ledges and pebbles. These

highly polished pebbles are apparently re-worked siliceous
items from the Paleozoic.
In the Historic Stage, the highly interesting Spanish Fort
site lies on the edge of the Cross Timbers area under discussion. Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954, pp. 92-98) have
recently traced the history of this site and given an outline
of the kinds of material found there.

AN HISTORIC INDIAN CACHE IN CLAY
COUNTY
DELEVAN WORSHAM 0ZEE

In September 1949 my two brothers Will and John, and
I, were exploring an eroded badland area 6 miles west of
Henrietta and 1f2 mile north of Turkey Creek. Will observed
a concentration of glass and shell beads eroding from a spot
about 4 feet above the base of a 50-foot escarpment. There
were fragments of cloth and bits of animal pelt with brown
hair which suggested a buffalo robe or garment. A round
silver buckle was found, 2% inches in diameter, and nine
brass or copper buttons, badly corroded but perhaps round
in shape originally (Plate 42) . Cloth impressions indicate
that the buttons may once have been cloth-covered. There
was also one ounce of powdered cinnabar and some small
cinnabar ore fragments.

On subsequent visits we were able to collect additional
quantities of loose beads in the soil. The final tally was as
follows: six tubular shell beads made from conch-shell columnellae, about 4 inches long; 12 extra large blue glass
beads; 700 medium-size glass beads, blue, white, and variegated; 3,396 small round glass beads, mostly white, with
some blue and a few red; several faceted glass beads (Plate
42).
No bones of any sort were discovered. No stones were
near this particular spot. If our find was once a stonecovered grave, the stones had slumped far down the slope .

COMMENTS CONCERNING THE EAST TEXAS
SECTION OF "AN INTRODUCTORY HANDBOOK OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY",
CLARENCE

H.

WEBB

The usefulness of this volume to present and future students of archeology should repay, many times over , the
hard work and headaches associated with its compilation
and the patience of the Society's members in awaiting its
publication. If it sets a pattern for similar handbooks in
other areas, as the authors hopefully anticipate, its values
will be multiplied. The members of the Texas Archeological
Society should feel proud that the Society's editor and members have produced this badly-needed summary of culture
complexes and artifact types presently recognized in the
state, with the full realization that incomplete information
and differences of opinion may precipitate some adverse
criticism. The authors anticipate this by regarding the
Handbook as introductory; they invite critical comparisons
and the reporting of local artifact analyses. In the light of
this invitation and at the specific request of the editor,
these comments are offered.
East Texas, stated by the authors to be a uniform geographic province which is distinct from other sections of the
state, is closely related in its physiography and archeology
to those portions of Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma
which are included in the "Caddoan Area". This area is
transected by the Red River, with its fertile valley and
numerous tributaries, the historic center of the Caddoan
Confederation and the chief nucleus of Caddoan prehistoric
development. As the details of cultural development in this
nuclear zone are more completely defined, the peripheral
zones and secondary nuclei will fall into clearer perspective.
It has been my good fortune to work in this zone along
Red River for 20 years, to study Caddoan culture from
1. Volume 25, Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society, 1954
(issued August, 1955) .

Gahagan Focus, late Alto and Haley Foci, through Bossier, Belcher and finally the historic Glendora Focus; to
visit all of the " Caddoan Area", maintaining contact with
professional and amateur archeologists; and to see all of
the major Caddoan collections. The authors of the Handbook were kind in referring to my efforts, but credit should
also go to the dozens of amateurs in the four-state area who
know their localities, who keep good records, and who make
their collections freely available to all who are interested:
Neild, Williamson, Todd, Fulton, Beckman and Dodd in
Louisiana; Lemley, Miroir, Dr. and Mrs. Hodges, Soday,
Proctor and Huddleston in Arkansas; Harris and his associates in Dallas, to mention only a few whom I have known.
All of these would join me in expressing the appreciation
of the amateur in Texas and the Caddoan Area to the professional archeologists for the splendid working relationship which exists, which has given vitality to the Texas
Archeological Society and the Caddoan Conferences, and
which is reflected in this Handbook by the masses of data
and artifacts out of which the authors have produced a
masterful ordering of cultures and types.
As one of these amateurs, I ask forgiveness of the reader
for taking this time and space to thank the Anthropology
staffs of the four state universities, and the other archeologists who have worked in this area, for helping to make our
avocation a search for truth as well as an enduring pleasure;
especially would I express gratitude to Alex Krieger for
the stimulating experience of cooperative endeavor and
friendly discussion (whether or not we agreed) through
many years. Major differences of opinion or observation
exhibited herein have been discussed with him and he has
urged that they be expressed, particularly the clarification
about mound-building along the Red River.
Discussion will follow the sequence of publication in the
Handbook section on East Texas and the subsequent related
typologies. Page and plate numbers refer to those in the
Handbook.

ADDITIONAL NOTES ON STAGES
PALEO-AMERICAN STAGE: In Northwest Louisiana,
as in East Texas, this stage is known by scattered occurrences of specific projectile-point types, mainly in certain
upland areas, but no real sites have been identified. The
Scottsbluff type outnumbers all others combined, with probably 100 of these in various collections. Plainview, Meserve
and Clovis points are represented and a few small fluted
points which seem to meet the criteria of Folsom projectiles
are known.
ARCHAIC STAGE: The authors mention our brief review of this stage in North Louisiana; the important Poverty Point culture has been clarified by recent excavations
of Ford and his co-workers in Mississippi and at the type
site in Louisiana. A more comprehensive report of Poverty
Point will be published shortly; the presence of a dozen
fiber-tempered pottery sherds in the excavations demonstrates the late Archaic to Transitional position of this culture and three Carbon-14 datings range between 400 and
800 B. C. This has some bearing on the Texas Archaic Stage
in that some of the East Texas artifact types are represented
at Poverty Point.
Apart from plummet stones, stone beads, pendants and
two-hole gorgets at Poverty Point, polished-stone artifacts
are infrequent in North Louisiana, seemingly less numerous than in southern Arkansas but more numerous than in
East Texas. This suggests a southwestward movement of
these traits, with Northwest Louisiana and East Texas remaining fringe areas.
Projectile and scraper types which are presumed to be
Archaic occur in the Bellevue and early Caddoan pottery
horizons in Northwest Louisiana, appearing as late as Bossier Focus in sufficient numbers to suggest the same kind
of late Archaic survival which is assumed to have occurred
in East Texas. The most numerous dart points in Northwest Louisiana are the Gary and Ellis types, with some representation of others mentioned for East Texas: Yarbrough,

262

Texas Archeological Society

Wells, Kent, Morrill, Trinity, CarrolLton, E lam, Palmillas,
Bulverde, WiLliams , Lange and Ensor points have been recognized. Stemmed projectiles with notched or concave
bases, as seen in the Uvalde, Pedernales, Martindale and
Mantell types are practically non-existent. It has been
established that San Patrice type extends in t o Arkansas as
far north as the Arkansas River.
The authors' suggestion that the tentative Pogo spearpaint type may hav e to be subdivided is borne out at the
Poverty Point site, where many large proj ectiles occur.
Typical Gary point!' occur there in respectable numbers,
with an unbroken range of length from 3 t o 11 em. Those
above 8 em. in length show no features other than size
which differentiate them from the smaller. The large sampling of over 1,000 projectiles from this site in local collections shows the same tendency to extend the limits of size
in several other types to 10-12 em.; any limitation of type
size appears arbitrary rather than factual.
NEO-AMERICAN STAGE : Northwest Louisiana seems
to differ from East Texas in having a burial-mound and
pottery-making horizon on a p re-Caddoan time level, apparently contemporaneous with the Marksville period. First
recognized by Fulton at the Bellevue site (Volume 24 of
this Bulletin, 1953), this complex has been extended by
subsequent excavations in two similar hilltop mounds in
Bossier Parish and is thought to cover a wider range of
territory. Search for this cultural expression in East Texas
along the Sabine drainage might be productive.
Krieger's concept (in 1943) of grouping Caddoan Area
foci into Gibson and Fulton Aspects has held up remarkably well throughout the area, with addition of the other
foci mentioned in the Handbook. In the Red River culture
nucleus, however, the dichotomy between these Aspects is
not as sharp and the most striking contrast occurs within
the Fulton Aspect itself-that is, between Belcher-Texarkana-McCurtain and the historic contact foci (Glendora
and the possible Hunt Focus mentioned by Krieger) . The

Comments Concerning Handbook

263

latter possibly represent the beginnings of what would
have been a third "Aspect", differing from Fulton in the
full advent of shell tempering, increased frequ ency of effigy
forms and red slip, distinctive changes in pottery types,
complete loss of the mound building trait, disappearance
of cultism and dropping off of evidences of a strong caste
system, sacrifice burials and burial ceremonialism.
Little direct evidence concerning temporal alignment of
Caddoan foci with the lower Mississippi sequence is available until the Plaquemine period in Louisiana, when trade
relationships equate this period with the Bossier and B elcher Foci. Small pointed-stem projectiles very similar to the
Bassett and Perdiz types were found with Plaquemine burials at the Sanson site, as were sherds of Cowhide Stamped
pottery. The pottery type Maddox Engraved is common
to Bossier and Plaquemine and a sherd of Evangeline Interior Engraved was found on a Belcher Focus house floor
at the Belcher site.
Haley Focus house patterns at the Belcher site include
a rectangular house with wall trenches, projecting entrance
and no roof supports; also a small circular house with eight
roof supports and an extended entrance. Large decorated
pottery platform pipes (also at Haley site, illustrated by
Moore) and a bone gorget from the Haley level at Belcher
should be included in the Haley Focus trait list (pp. 171175).
Bossier Focus sites in Louisiana are found also in Bossier, Webster, Claiborne, Bienville and Lincoln Parishes.
Surface surveys indicate that this focus extends into southern Arkansas, as far as the Ouachita River. The hilltop
mounds quoted by the authors from my prior publication
as a Bossier trait are now thought to belong to the Bellevue
complex, although some occur near or adjacent to Bossier
sites. Subject to further clarification, they should be removed from Bossier trait lists (pp. 196-199) .

MOUND BUILDING IN FULTON ASPECT
Further explanation of mound-building versus moundusing in Belcher Focus times is in order. Our discussions
had given Krieger the impression that initial mound building at the Belcher site occurred during the Haley occupation, with increments during Bossier and Belcher periods,
comparable with the situation at the Hatchel site in Bowie
County, Texas, where an initial Haley mound was enlarged
during the Texarkana occupation. At Belcher the Haley
occupation was pre-mound and ended with burning of two
structures which we found beneath Mounds A and B. The
ruins of these buildings were then covered with irregular
masses of soil. Layers of water-laid sand and thin occupation debris layers indicated that some time passed before
the ruins were covered with more soil, which was levelled
off after about 2 feet high, and houses built. In the instance
Of Mound B, two houses were constructed and used by Bossier people; the house on the primary mound of Mound A
was used by Belcher Focus people and all subsequent construction of both mounds, which finally produced an elon-

Comments Concerning Handbook

267

gate mound with Mound A reaching a total of 10-12 feet in
height and the platform B 8 feet in height, was by Belcher
Focus people. Two occupation levels of Belcher Focus were
found in each mound above the primary stages.
Mounds were present at the Foster, Friday, McClure,
Jones and Moore sites in Southwest Arkansas from which
Moore illustrated typical Belcher pottery, much of which
came from mound burials. His report indicates in several
instances that these mounds were similar to the Belcher
mound, but evidence as to antecedent Haley occupation is
lacking. At the Battle and Crenshaw mound sites, Haley
occupation preceded that of Belcher and Texarkana Focus
and there is doubt that any mound construction at Crenshaw
can be attributed to these later people. The Battle excavations have not been reported, but apparently initial mound
construction occurred during Haley times, with considerable portions of the huge mound added by Bossier and
Belcher peoples.
It therefore appears that the Red River nuclear zone
affords an exception to the general rule that mound building in the Caddoan Area ceased after Gibson times. The
peoples of Belcher Focus carried on the tradition of mound
building and usage for temple substructures, just as they
carried on in some degree the traditions of deep and multiple burials, placement of multiple offerings, possible immolation, ceremonial temple burning, various items of cultism and other "high church" traits. There is evidence that
a lesser degree of mound construction and ceremonialism
also existed in Texarkana and McCurtain Foci, but the
Belcher Focus people were the chief and almost sole heirs
of the intense ceremonialism which prevailed during Gibson Aspect times.
POTTERY TYPES

Belcher Engraved. Moore suggested cosmic symbolism in
these designs, including the 4-node quadration, presence of
the cross or swastika or triskele centering the concentric
circles, and possible sun-and-ray symbols. No flower or

268

Texas Archeological Society

plant patterns have been recognized in Caddoan decorations,
hence it may be preferable to substitute "cosmic symbols"
for the words "flower or star-like elements" in the design
description. Quadrating nodes appear on the lip of small
vessels like Plate 5E, only on the angulated shoulders of
flat bowls like B, F-I.

Cowhide Stamped. Plate 13, L has stamped instead of incised cross lines filling the rim bands. Plate 20, K has
similarly stamped bands and should be included in Cowhide
Stamped type. Plates 13 and 20 show the close relationship
between Cowhide Stamped and Foster types.
Fulton Aspect Rattle Bowls and Noded Bowls. The type
name Moore Noded has been applied to clay-tempered noded
bowls by Howard in Arkansas and is used in our Belcher
manuscript. This contrasts with type Fortune Noded of
Phillips, Ford and Griffin, which is shell-tempered.
Glassell Engraved. This should be considered a tentative
type which needs more definition. I have applied it at
Belcher only to bowls like Plate 25, E, G, H , J-M, which
show rectilinear designs which may be derived from Krieger's "stepped designs" of the Davis site report. The rectilinear "stepped design" concept occurs in the Southwest, in
the Plaquemine complex (type L'Eau Noir), in Moundville
pottery and on the rims of Natchitoches Engraved bowls in
Glendora Focus. Krieger and I agree that Plate 25, N is an
atypical Natchitoches Engraved bowl. The eventual correct
placement of bottles A-C, I is uncertain.
Hempstead Engraved. By mutual agreement, some very
large bottles found in Texarkana, Belcher and Haley Foci,
decorated only with encircling engraved line and pendant
triangles at the base of the spout, are to be added to this type.
Hodges Engraved. Red filming of this type also occurs
rarely at the Belcher site in Louisiana.
Military Road Incised. The original type was set up by
Dr. and Mrs. Hodges and myself to incorporate only vessels like Plate 48, A-C, E which had fields of incising or

Comments Concerning Handbook

269

brushing separated by meandering or undulating bands of
punctations or dentate stamping. This made a characteristic
type, found abundantly in Mid-Ouachita Focus. Vessels
with decorations like Plate 48, D, F-I occur also in Bossier
Focus and the Plaquemine complex in Louisiana and have
been considered variants of Dunkin or Manchac Incised. In
a recent letter, Krieger has agreed to exclude Plate 48, D,
F-I from Military Road Incised, limiting the latter to the
original conception.

Pease Brushed-Incised. In Haley and Bossier Focus pottery in Arkansas, and in the Plaquemine of Louisiana at the
Sanson site, the panels of Pease vessels are nearly always
outlined by horizontal rows of punctates, as seen on the
high rims of several vessels in Plate 53. The panels are
nearly always vertical on Bossier vessels or sherds from
Louisiana, as in Plate 53, J . Either arrangement should be
acceptable for the type, with recognition of local variations.
Taylor Engraved. The vessels shown in Plate 65, M and
66 D, E must have been placed in this type from photographs, because of the scroll motif similar to that of Taylor.
These are from the Belcher site and, with a fourth small
jar which is decorated with arcs or "fish hook" figures
similar to 66 E, are classified in our report as Keno Trailed
type. This type is infrequent in Belcher Focus and we examined these vessels very carefully; since publication of
the Handbook they have been re-examined. There is no
question about the technique; they are not engraved but
are "trailed" with the same smooth drag-incising of a blunt
tool which is seen in Keno Trailed from Glendora, Keno,
Mid-Ouachita and Natchitoches sites. Jar and bottle forms,
extended bases, and short necks are seen in both Keno and
Taylor types; scrolls, volutes and spirals may be seen in
both types; and therefore it would appear that the decisive
criterion between them must be the decoration technique,
for which reason the vessels in Plates 65, M and 66 D, E
have been placed in Keno Trailed in our report. As sometimes happens, they represent a combination of features
from two distinct types.

270

Texas Archeological Society

Smithport Plain. Also includes plain vessels from Louisiana Alto Focus sites, with tapered-spout bottles somewhat
resembling those of Holly and Hickory Fine Engraved in
shape, although thicker-walled and made of lighter colored
wares.
Wilkinson Punctated. Continues to be a useful type in
Louisiana, since whole vessels and rim sherds are found
from many sites which have fingernail punctations extending to the rim as the sole decoration. However, pottery
should not be classed as Wilkinson unless large enough parts
are present to prove that both rim and body were covered
with fingernail punctates. Plate 70, H, I, illustrates vessels
which we would so classify.
PROJECTILE-POlNT TYPES

Alba Points. Confusion has arisen in that Ford and Cotter, in publications concerning Coles Creek and Plaquemine
sites, have included in Alba type those projectiles with
blades like Alba but with expanded stems - projectiles
which Ford originally described as "fir-tree" in shape.
Krieger and I have confined the Alba type to those projectiles which have a rectangular stem, as shown in Plate
126, A-C. Both types occur in Louisiana and were found
together in Gahagan burial pits, where the rectangularstemmed Alba points exceeded all other projectiles combined. In Central Louisiana, the expanded stem becomes
more frequent. A similar type, the Scallorn point (Plate
132, A-C) is common in Central Texas and some of them
are identical to the Louisiana points Ford originally described as "fir-tree" in shape. Krieger states that this form
is rare in the intervening area of East Texas. It would
seem desirable, with these differences in distribution, to
confine the Alba type to those with more or less rectangular
stems; to use the name Scallorn for the majority of examples in Plate 132 which have expanded stems and sufficient side notching to produce straight shoulders (rare or
non-existent in Louisiana); and to set up a new type for
those with expanded stems, long barbs and tendency to

Comments Concerning Handbook

271

concave or recurved blade edges. Related types would be
the Hayes points of Haley Focus, which have diamond or
lozenge-shaped stems, and another projectile of Central and
Northern Louisiana, which has wide shoulders, long and
wide barbs, convex bases and basal notching.
It has been a pleasure to read and review this Handbook; it has already been and will continue to be a useful
tool. Congratulations are herewith extended to the authors
for completion of a fine volume and to the printers for their
part in producing this superbly illustrated book.

COMMENTS CONCERNING SOME TYPE
NAMES IN nAN INTRODUCTORY
HANDBOOK OF TEXAS
ARCHEOLOGY"
CYRUS

N. RAY

This cloth-bound volume of 582 pages and 134 plates is
well edited, well printed and proof-read, and the pictures
are well done. This is the largest and evidently the most
expensive volume so far issued by the Texas Archeological
Society.
The introduction by Alex Krieger is excellent, the reasoning logical, and the quality of his writing is far above
that of the usual professional archeologists, who frequently
lack clarity and sometimes forthrightness of expression. We
consider the introduction to be the best-written part of the
book.
The most unfortunate feature of the book is that so many
of the classifications adopt Kelley's re-namings of the work
of others who had spent many years in making the basic
discoveries. Thus, many of the Handbook plates and type
descriptions show an absence of citations directing attention
to the fact that they show dart-point types under new names.
This will be quite confusing to careful researchers who have
read the original literature.
The writer will only discuss the stone artifact section of
the Handbook, especially the types of ancient man. Our
knowledge of pottery is not sufficient for comments on that
section. Apparently the person quoted most often as the
namer of ancient dart points, previously well known under
the names given them 15 or 20 years earlier, is one J. Charles
Kelley. Evidently this gentleman must have decided that
the names given these dart points by those who discovered
them, and who did the original research and publication on
them, lacked euphony or something and needed his lastminute attentions; but he should not have forgotten to mention their well-known, prior designations.

Comments Concerning Type Names

273

On Plate 80, under the name of Angostura points, we see
darts of a type first found near Abilene in ancient Clear
Fork Silts, and described and illustrated in the Bulletin of
the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society (1929;
1934, Plate 18, Nos. 93, 94, 95). Why the compilers of the
Handbook went to South Dakota for a name for these points,
first pictured in the literature as a very ancient Texas type,
we know not.
On Plate 81 of the Handbook we have Bulverde points,
and of the 25 examples shown as the same type, there seem
to be 11 different kinds.
On Plate 86 we have Darl points, and there seem to be
some different types included here also, but most of the
darts shown are of the earliest phase of the Valley Creek
Culture, which were used just before small arrow heads
superceded dart heads. They usually are found with undecorated potsherds of two types, both tempered with fossil
bone. In the late phase of Valley Creek Culture, we have
incised potsherds, and arrow heads of the pine tree and
side-notched triangular forms supercede the dart heads. The
four-edged beveled knife occurs in both the early and the
late phase. All these features are markers of Valley Creek
Culture.
The Handbook lists the Valley Creek Culture arrow heads
on Plates 129 and 131 as Harrell and Perdiz points, with no
reference to previous terminology or descriptions. The components of the Valley Creek Culture were first shown in
the 1935 Bulletin of this Society as being found at Pottery
Site 17. Later, E. B. Sayles and the writer agreed on the
name Valley Creek Culture, with these beveled dart heads,
pine-tree arrow head, side-notched triangular arrow head,
and four-edged beveled knife as the markers for this culture.
Obsidian from New Mexico and Rio Grande potsherds from
Valley Creek Culture sites were identified as such by Dr.
H. P . Mera of the Laboratory of Anthropology in Santa Fe,
and the findings published in the 1935 Bulletin. The late

274

Texas Archeological Society

phase of Valley Creek Culture was the last flint culture in
Central Texas.
On Plate 108 of the Handbook are shown some so-called
"Nolan points", but why Nolan is a mystery, as they seldom
occur in Nolan County but are common in Taylor County
to the east of it. This type was described as Clear Fork Dart
2 in an article on the Clear Fork Culture Complex in the
1938 Bulletin, and 25 specimens were shown on Plate 25 of
that Bulletin. On page 458 of the Handbook, we read that
"Kelley, 1947a, p. 99 and Plate 10, D refers to this type as
'Nolan Beveled Stem' and considers it as the diagnostic trait
of his 'Clear Fork Focus' although it occurs throughout the
Edwards Plateau; he includes C. N. Ray's 'Clear Fork Dart
Points 1 and 2' within it."
To the writer as the one who named and first described
the Clear Fork Culture in the literature, the above reference
about reaches the limit. In my opinion, the term "Kelley's
'Clear Fork Focus' " was designed to imply that someone
other than the writer discovered and first described the
Clear Fork artifacts.
On Plates 113-115 of the Handbook there is another collection of dart heads whose only co.mmon point of similarity
is a bifurcated base, but from there on they are divergent.
Thomas Wilson, in the 1897 Annual Report of the United
States National Museum, Plate 38, shows ten bifurcated
points, two of them from Texas. Several others were shown
by the writer in an article published in Scientific American
in January, 1928. One form of the bifurcated point has been
well known for many years as the Pinto Point, named by
the Campbells of Twentynine Palms, California. The Campbells visited the writer several years ago and identified
some Pinto Points in his collections. The so-called Pedernales
points in the Handbook seem to include seven or more different types, unrelated in time. On Plate 113, we think that
at least six points (E, F , K, 0, R, S) are definitely Pinto
Points.

Comments Concerning Type Names

275

On Plate 113, too, the point shown as A is the most unrelated to all the others in type and greatly resembles what
the writer named and described as the Gibson Point in the
1940 Bulletin of this Society. It was found in place in the
Gibson site in Lower Clear Fork Silt, 25 feet below the
present surface, where it was witnessed by Dr. Otto 0. Watts
â¢
of Hardin-Simmons University and E. J. Gardiner of the
University of Texas. The same type of dart had previously
been found on the surface of ancient gravel at the McLean
site (1940 Bulletin, Plates 41, Nos. 2, 3, and 42, No. 15).
Dr. J. E. Pearce of the University of Texas illustrated
bifurcated points in his article on "The Present Status of
Texas Archeology" in the 1932 volume of this Bulletin (p. 44
and Plate 10). He illustrated the later and larger forms
which he found in the middle section of his "Old BurntRock Mounds".
Perhaps we should begin to use the scientific methods of
priority in discovery and printed description as a basis for
terminology, instead of changing the names of artifacts
every time a new crop of students arrives on the scene.
Wilson's term "bifurcate" has age and distinction back of
it, and could be used as the general term for the points on
Plates 113-115. Then, if anyone can give data on the location
and age of any special variety, let him name it unless someone else has already done the work.
Plate 120 shows 25 triangular dart points of the Clear
Fork Dart 3 and 4 types, which were first fully described
in an article by the writer entitled "The Clear Fork Culture
Complex" in the 1938 Bulletin of this Society. On Plate
25 of this article, 28 of these darts are illustrated. In the
Handbook, they are listed as Tortugas points-why, we do
not know, as they do not resemble tortoises. The Clear Fork
Dart 3 and 4 types which are classed with Tortugas points
in the Handbook are quite distinct in the flint-knapping
techniques, and only resemble the others in having a general
triangular shape.

Texas Archeological Society

276

Clear Fork Dart types 3 and 4 were probably used much
later than types 1 and 2 during the thousands of years of
duration of the Clear Fork Culture, but the main marker
of this culture is the Clear Fork gouge, which has always
been found with all four types of these darts where they
occur in pure culture deposits .

.

The authors of the Handbook did a vast amount of hard
work in producing this book. The effort was worthwhile,
as it is something which had long needed doing. Only those
who have burned the midnight oil for years in similar endeavors are in a position to appreciate how much work
has been done. The text needs revision by scholars and
scientists who will ruthlessly cull out some mistakes and
omissions in terminology and credits which should not go
unchallenged.
609 Orange St.
Abilene, Texas

Editor's Note: Most of the "mistakes and omissions" in terminology which Dr. Ray has pointed out did not arise from
any wish to ignore his well-known researches for many
years in the Abilene area. Rather, they were simply the
result of divergent opinions on what constitutes a type of
artifact. Dr. Ray's published types were the result of his
observations and studies in that particular part of Texas.
On the other hand, in preparing the Handbook, we were
trying to create valid types from great numbers of specimens from many parts of Texas, which gave rise to many
very difficult problems in determining the range of variation
which could be included in each type, and in determining
where to make the divisions between forms that overlapped
in every possible way.
Certainly we made no claim that any of the Handbook
types were better than those described in print by Dr. Ray,
or should supercede them: they are simply different because
they were formulated in a different way. Thus, if Dr. Ray
thinks there are really 11 different types in what we illustrated as Bulverde, seven or more types in the Pedernales

Comments Concerning Type Names

277

photographs, etc., he is certainly entitled to think so, but
he should also present the detailed type descriptions needed
for others to understand his reasoning.
I believe now, that to be consistent, we should not have
used any of the type names coined by Kelley, for he has
never published any detailed descriptions or adequate illustrations of any projectile-point types; in fact, far less than
Dr. Ray has. In any case, we could have made our position
clearer at some points in the Handbook and avoided such
misunderstandings. I apologize to Dr. Ray for not specifically stating that some Handbook types were not supposed
to agree with his conceptions, even though there is some
overlapping in regard to individual specimens.
In such cases as "side-notched triangular", "pine-tree",
and "bifurcated", these are not type names in the modern
sense, but only roughly descriptive names for basic shapes.
In North America as a whole there are several distinct types
which could each be called "pine-tree", etc., so that when
we applied a name such as Perdiz, we had in mind a much
more specific form. As to Pinto points in Texas, it is true
that some of the Texas "bifurcated" points are practically
identical to some of the California Pintos, but what about
all the rest of them? Almost any type will inevitably overlap in some degree with another type in the same area or
another area; so how can the typological problems be solved
without a great deal of comparative work over large areas?
Artifact typology requires continual change and adjustment
as more is learned about the ranges of variation and how
they are distributed. Thus there are no types, in my opinion,
which can be set up once and remain valid forever; and
when different workers conflict in their conceptions, I know
of no method for determining who is closest to the truth
except that everyone interested should keep testing the
suggested types against facts of distribution in time, space,
and cultural association.
As to the question of who first discovered and named the
Clear Fork Culture, of course there is not the slightest doubt

278

Texas Archeological Society

in anyone's mind that it was Dr. Ray. He seems to have
missed the significance of our enclosing "Clear Fork Focus"
in quotation marks when referring to Kelley. We did this
deliberately to distinguish such a "Focus" from Dr. Ray's
Clear Fork Cultv.re. On pages 106-107 of the text, we clearly
stated that we did not know what the evidence was for
distinguishing this "Focus" from the others grouped b y
Kelley under Edwards Plateau Aspect, and therefore would
lump them all under the general term of Edwards Plateau
Aspect. I realize now that the use of quotation marks did
not really explain anything and repeat that this positively
was not meant to deprive Dr. Ray of any credit in priority
for the Clear Fork Culture.
It is fortunate that Dr. Ray has taken this opportunity to
set the record straight on priority of terminology, and perhaps this brief explanation will clear the air somewhat.

Midland, were attended by many of the members on Sunday.
The business meeting, held at 2:00 p. m ., November 5,
was opened by the President of the Society, W. C. Holden.
Minutes were read by Dee Ann Suhm, acting as SecretaryTreasurer in the absence of Edward B. Jelks, and approved
by a voice vote. The ~cting Secretary-Treasurer then initiated new business b;y reporting on the financial conditions
of the Society and status of membership. As no auditing
committee had been appointed to examine the Society's
books, it was agreed by voice vote to accept the financial
report published on page 566, Volume 25 of the Bulletin.
The Editor of Publications, Alex D. Krieger, gave his report, stating plans for Volume 25 and the reason for its
delay in publication. He also discussed means of increasing
the Society's income, emphasizing the need for selling more
back issues of the Bulletin. Cyrus N. Ray suggested that
Volume I, which is out of print, be reproduced. It was
agreed that this should be investigated and that a final
decision should be postponed until the cost of reproduction
could be determined.
The Nominating Committee, headed by 0. L. Sims, presented a slate of nominees for the various offices. This was
adopted by voice vote in lieu of formal balloting. The new
officers are listed in the front of this Bulletin.
It was decided that the Executive Committee should select
the location of the 1955 meeting. Following a vote of thanks
to Sul Ross College, and to Dr. Wildenthal and Victor J.
Smith for providing such excellent facilities for this meeting, the formal business was concluded.

THE 1955 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE
TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
The 26th annual meeting of the Society was held in the
Museum of Texas Technological College in Lubbock, on
November 11-13, 1955. A short field trip to the Lubbock
Lake Site was conducted on Friday afternoon, November
11th, followed by a barbecue supper at the Museum. At
7:45 P. M., President Floyd V. Studer called to order a
business meeting with an address of welcome and expression of thanks to Dr. and Mrs. W. C. Holden and the Museum
for providing facilities for the Society's annual meeting.
The minutes of last year's meeting were read by the
Secretary-Treasurer, Dee Ann Suhm. These were adopted
by a voice vote. The Secretary-Treasurer then reported
that :
(1) Receipts up to November 1, 1955 (including a loan
of $3,500 from the Texas State Bank) totaled $7,678.87;
(2) expenditures amounted to $6,578.95, leaving a total
balance of $1,099.92;
(3) the first note on the loan from the Texas State Bank
in Austin will be due April 15, 1956;
(4) that membership had increased to over 400 members;
(5) that all back issues of the Bulletin will sell for $5.00
each (Volumes 2 and 4 through 21 had been selling
for $3.00 each); and
(6) one copy of the Bulletin, the issue to be selected by
the Secretary-Treasurer, will be awarded to a member for every three new members solicited.
Judge 0. L. Sims, Chairman of the Nominating Committee, then presented a slate of nominees for the 1955-56

BOOK REVIEW
The Midland Discovery: A Report on the Pleistocene Human Remains from Midland, Texas. By Fred Wendorf, Alex D. Krieger,

and Claude C. Albritton. With a description of the skull by T. D.
Stewart. University of Texas Press, Austin, 1955. Pp. viii, 139, 36
figures, bibliography, index. $3.50.
Anyone who attempts to evaluate this book should know certain
facts about its publication. In the first place, additional field work
was done at Midland by E. H. Sellards after the manuscript of the
book had already been substantially completed. Second, actual
printing of the book was delayed pending receipt of radiocarbon
dates, which failed to support some of the authors' interpretations.
Third, still more excavation was done by Fred Wendorf after the
book was released. As a result the report is somewhat lacking in
unity and economy of presentation, and it also contains certain
conclusions that the authors will want to modify because of postpublication discoveries. It is too bad that they were trapped by
press commitments and were unable to delay publication a few
months longer. The main thesis of the book is that Midland man
is pre-Folsom in date, whereas the most recent field work suggests
that Midland man may actually be Folsom man. It would be better
if reviews of this book could be postponed until the authors have
had an opportunity to re-examine their data in the light of the
latest field investigations at Midland.
The Midland Discovery synthesizes the field and laboratory contributions of an impressive number of individuals. In addition to
the work of the four co-authors, eight other specialists prepared
technical reports that appear in a series of seven appendices, and
the Introduction acknowledges at least a dozen additional individuals who made significant contributions to the project. Wendorf and his associates seem to have exploited their data to the
fullest extent possible, and they are to be congratulated for producing a clear exposition of a very complex problem.
The Midland skeleton was found at the Scharbauer site, which
consists of five blowout localities in a sand-dune area at the southern end of the Llano Esta.cado . Extensive excavation was done- at
Locality 1, where the skeletal remains were found, and surface
collections of archeological materials were made at Localities 2-5.
The stratigraphic sequence established by excavation at Locality
1 consists of five units or strata of sand separated by disconformities.
The lower three units, which contain extinct faunal remains, constitute the Judkins formation; the upper two, with modern faunal
remains, the Monahans formation. In order of age (from oldest to
youngest) these units are :
Unit 1, the Judkins white sand, is an indurated lake-bed deposit
whiJch yielded bones of mammoth, bison, horse, camel, four-horned
antelope, peccary, wolf, and possibly sloth; a horse femur showing cuts believed to have been made by a flint tool; and a single
fragment of chipped flint. It is suggested that the white sand may
be contemporaneous with the lower lake-bed deposit at the Clovis
site, a stratum which has yielded Clovis points. Three small samples of unburned bone were combined to provide a radiocarbon date
of 6715 B. C. (plus or minus 600 years). The authors do not accept
this relatively late date as valid.

290

Texas Archeological Society

----------------------~~--~~~~--------------

Unit 2, the Judkins gray sand, is a dune accumulation that
yielded bones of horse, bison, and possibly mammoth, as well as
fire-fractured rocks, charred bones, three flint scrapers, and 13 flint
flakes. From a wind-eroded surface of the gray sand three projectile points were collected-an "unfluted Folsom" point, a basal
fragment of a similar point (which to me looks like a Plainview
point), and a lanceolate point with deeply concave base. The authors accept ''unfluted Folsom" points as part of the Folsom complex.
The bones of Midland man lay on this same eroded surface, and
two of the three projectile points also lay n earby. Because the
human bones are mineralized and appear to have had Judkins gray
sand adhering to them, and also because the fluorine content of the
human bones agrees with that of the animal bones from the Judkins
formation as a whole, the Midland skeletal remains are assigned to
the gray sand. A very small sample of carbon derived from unburned bone collected from the gray sand yielded two radiocarbon
dates: the first, based on the standard 48-hour count, was between
3000 and 2000 B. C.; the second, based on a two-week count, was
5145 B. C. (plus or minus 1,000 years). The age determinations for
the white sand and the gray sand agree with the stratigraphic
sequence, but the authors think that both dates are too recent and
reject them. Recent field work has resulted in the discovery of a
single "unfluted Folsom" point in the gray sand. If the ''unfluted
Folsom" point was made by the makers of Folsom points-and
this has yet to be proved-then the Midland skeleton may be an
example of Folsom man, not pre-Folsom man, as argued in the
book.
Unit 3, the Judkins red sand, is a dune deposit capped by a soil
zone. This unit yielded bones of horse, antelope, deer or elk, and
possibly mammoth. From the present wind-deflated surface of this
unit two projectile points were collected, a medial fragment of what
appears to be an "unfluted Folsom" point and a basal fragment
from a small lall)Ceolate point. The authors think that all of the
"unfluted Folsom" points at Locality 1 came from the soil zone
capping this red sand, and it is suggested that this soil zone may be
correlated with the diatomite layer at Clovis and at Lubbock (Folsom points occur in the diatomite at both of these sites). The
whole Judkins formation (Units 1-3) is placed in the Wisconsin
glacial period, and the soil zone at the top of Unit 3 is specifically
correlated with the last major Wisconsin glacial advance. Since
the "unfluted Folsom" point has been found in the Judkins gray
sand (Unit 2), a !Correlational realignment appears to be in order.
Unit 4, the Monahans light-brown sand, represents more r ecent
dunes stabilized by vegetation; and Unit 5, the Monahans tan sand,
represents present-day active dunes. These units contain a modern
fauna, but no artifacts are reported from them.
At Localities 2-5, a total of 75 artifacts was collected from the
surface-seven Folsom points, 20 "unfluted Folsom" points, one
Milnesand point, one Meserve point, 24 points that are not identified by type but which include a number of stemmed points, 19
scrapers or knives, and two manos. In all localities these were collected from the exposed surface of the Judkins red sand, and it
is argued that the red sand cannot be more recent than the Folsom points found on its wind-eroded surface, an opinion which
the authors may now want to suppress. Little interest is shown

in the stemmed proj ectile points from several of these blowout
localities. These are dismissed with the statement that they are
probably later than the Folsom material in the same blowouts.
Some of these stemmed forms resemble points from relatively late
cultures of the Trans-Pecos area to the southwest, and this might
have been cited in support of the statement about their probable
chronological position.
The Midland skeletal remains are briefly described by Stewart.
These consist of an incomplete skull, parts of two m etacarpals,
the mid-section of a first rib, and an unspecified number of small
fragments that probably represent arm bones. All of these bones
are attributed to the same individual, a female who died at about
the age of thirty. The skull is very long and narrow and has a
closely estimated cranial index of 68.8. According to Stewart, no
other American skull with a fair claim to antiquity exhibits such
low dolichocrany, but he points out that at a number of places
in Texas (Abilene region, Big Bend, and Texas coast) similar
long, narrow skulls have been reported, some of which may be
rather early in date. Citing the fragmentary nature of the single
Midland skull, as well as the paucity of female crania for proper
comparison, Stewart states that "detailed comparisons with other
putatively ancient American skulls would not be profitable." If
Midland man is as early as it seems to be, then the same physical
type survived and was well represented in the Texas population
for thousands of years.
At this time certain salient facts about the Midland discovery
need emphasis. The human remains were not found in place, and
their assignment to the gray sand is based on indirect evidence. No
Folsom points were found in place, and none was found on the surface at Locality 1, where the human bones were collected. The
presence of an "unfluted Folsom" point in the gray sand does not
necessarily prove that the Midland skeletal remains are those of
Folsom man. Although it appears likely that both Folsom and
''unfluted Folsom" points were made at the same time by the same
people, this has yet to be demonstrated by excavation data. The
case for Midland man is a good one, but it cannot be regarded as
closed. More excavation should be done at Locality 1, and the
stratigraphy at this locality needs verifitcation by excavation at
other localities in the dune area . In the meantime some attention
should be given to the typology of the ''unfluted Folsom" point, now
that it has been found in place. We n eed more criteria for distinguishing it from the Plainview point, especially in cases where
points are represented by basal fragments only.
I would like to register one minor complaint about the illustrations in this volume. The artifa cts from the various localities are
well illustrated in 15 figures, but the system of identifying artifocts
in these figures leaves something to be desired. The artifacts are
serially numbered from 1 in Fig. 12 to 89 in Fig. 25. This makes
sense, but why, in Fig 18, for instance, should the top row of
specimens be arranged (from left to right) in the following sequence: 45, 51, 42, 39, 40, and 38? This arrangement, which is also
found in eight additional figures, makes it unnecessarily difficult
to find illustrations of specimens de~ribed in the text.

COL. M. L. CRIMMINS
With the death of Col. Crimmins, the Texas Archeological
Society lost one of its most esteemed members. Col. Crimmins had been an active member since the Society was
chartered in 1929, had served as Regional Vice-President,
Director, and Trustee at various times, was President in
1948-1949, and a Fellow from 1952 until his death. His wide
range of interests, keen mind, gentle manners and unfailing
courtesy will be remembered for a long time to come.
Mr. Chris Emmett of San Antonio, who is writing a biography of Col. Crimmins, has supplied the following data.
Colonel Martin Lalor Crimmins, United States Army retired, died at San Antonio from a heart attack on February
5, 1955, after a few days illness. Born in New York in 1875,
one of 14 children of John Daniel and Lily Lalor Crimmins,
he had not quite attained his 80th birthday at the time of
his passing. Colonel Crimmins' grandfather immigrated from
Ireland at about the time Sam Houston was fighting the
battle of San Jacinto.
Martin Lalor Crimmins' early education at Georgetown
College, and later at the University of Virginia, qualified
him for what were to be his hobbies in later years, the
sciences. His career as a medical doctor was interrupted
by a personal invitation from Col. Theodore Roosevelt to
join the Rough Riders. Finding adventure in the Army so
appealing, he made the Army his career, serving in the
Philippines, in Alaska, and with General Pershing in the
Mexican Punitive Expedition.
After World War I, he was retired for disability. He
then applied himself industriously to his avocations, gaining international renown and the Walter Reed Award for
distinguished service to humanity by causing rattlesnake
poison to be injected into his body, so as to make antivenom serum. He gave many of his later years to writing.
More than 200 articles of scientific and historical nature
appeared in publications in the United States and England.
Much of the last year of his life was devoted to collaborating with Chris Emmett in recording the experiences
which had taken him into many countries as a participant
in world history-making events.
Surviving Colonel Crimmins are his widow, Josephine Y.
Crimmins, two sons, Lalor and Curtis, of San Francisco and
New York, respectively, as well as four sisters and one
brother, all of New York.
