ABSTRACT

Fort Concho National Historic Landmark, also designated as a Texas Historic Landmark, undertook the renovation and restoration of Enlisted Men's Barracks 2 as part of the ongoing master
plan of the City of San Angelo to restore the fort as closely as possible to its Indian Wars-period
appearance (ca.1880). Renovation and restoration were authorized under the Texas Historical
Commission's Buildings and Structure Permit No. HS 122 and Texas Antiquities Permit No.
1865.
Restoration necessitated the removal of a concrete driveway and loading dock on the east end of
the building so that a missing twenty-three feet six inches of the original barracks could be
reconstructed. Porches on the west, south and east sides of the building would also need to be
rebuilt and the area surrounding the barracks would require regrading to an elevation of 1,842
feet 8 3/4 inches above sea level.
Architectural plans were developed by Henry Schmidt of H. Schmidt Architects of San Angelo
and the construction firm of Master Builders Construction of Midland was hired for the actual
renovation. Construction work was monitored by Fort Concho personnel as follows: Executive
Director Robert F. Bluthardt and Melvin Bohnert, Director of Grounds and Operations, oversaw
work on the building itself; Curator of Collections Kathleen S. Roland monitored excavation of
the grounds in and around the building. Every effort was made to insure that the building
retained its historical integrity during the renovation. Artifacts recovered during the effort were
preserved and researched, and have since been added to the fort's permanent museum collection.
Archeological investigation confirmed the presence of limestone porch footings on the south,
east and west sides of the building. Four individual fourteen-inch-square limestone footings
were found on the shorter west and east ends at intervals of nine feet two inches center to
center. A continuous fourteen-inch-wide limestone footing was located nine feet from the south
perimeter of the· building.
On the east and west sides, all but one of the original limestone footings were saved and
incorporated into the reconstruction. Work on the east and west porches was halted at one point
to accommodate this modification to the architect's preliminary plans. These plans had called
for digging a continuous one-foot-deep footing filled with poured concrete in a effort to keep
the porches from sagging.

Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION

Archeological investigation and research of Enlisted Men's Barracks 2 at the Fort Concho
National Historic Landmark in San Angelo, Texas, began in August 1997, prior to and
concurrent with the restoration and reconstruction of the building. Findings from this
archeological effort resulted in alterations to preliminary plans for the physical work which
began August 6, 1997, under Texas Historical Commission's Historic Buildings and Structures
Permit No. HS 122. Restoration work was performed by Henry Schmidt ofH. Schmidt
Architects of San Angelo and the construction firm of Master Builders Construction of
Midland, Texas, Jack Huffman, superintendent.
Archeological investigation confirmed the presence oflimestone porch footings on the south,
east and west sides of the building. Four individual fourteen-inch-square limestone footings
were found on the shorter west and east ends at intervals of nine feet two inches center to
center. A continuous fourteen-inch-wide limestone footing was located nine feet from the south
perimeter of the building.
On the east and west sides, all but one of the original limestone footings were saved and
incorporated into the reconstruction. Work on the east and west porches was halted at one point
to accommodate this modification of the architect's preliminary plans. These plans had called
for digging a continuous one-foot-deep footing filled with poured concrete in a effort to keep
the porches from sagging.
Aside from the reconstruction of the porches, physical restoration of the Barracks 2 building and
its surrounding area included grading the ground to the west and south, removing the existing
concrete driveway and loading dock at the east end and reconstructing the missing twenty-three
feet six inches at the east end of the building.
Artifacts recovered from the excavated areas were analyzed and have become part of the
permanent collection at Fort Concho. The analysis of these artifacts and any conclusions as to
their historical significance is the basis of this report. These conclusions are contained in
Chapter 5.

Chapter 2: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
by Karen Fields

From its days as a frontier fort where buffalo roamed across its parade grounds, to today's Fort
Concho National Historic Landmark located within the City of San Angelo, Texas, Fort Concho
has become a prime example of a "living history" museum of the nineteenth century. A
portion of its significance in the context of Texas history is the black Buffalo Soldier -- so
called, according to generally accepted belief, because of the Indians' conception of the
"similarity between the hair of the African American soldiers and the wooly hide of the buffalo"
(Griffin 1996:Leaf2). But in the full context of history, the story of the Buffalo Soldier is not
the whole story of Fort Concho.
Fort Concho was established on December 4, 1867, to aid in the Anglo-American settlement of
Central West Texas and to map the vast, unexplored region. Units from the fort protected
settlers and travelers through the area, constructed roads, strung telegraph wires and escorted the
U.S. mail (Brown et al. 1989:43). Fort Concho detachments also served as escorts for cattle
drives along the Goodnight-Loving cattle trail between the Concho River and Horsehead
Crossing on the Pecos River, a particularly dangerous leg of the drive. "From June to August,
1872, Capt. Joseph Rendlebrock and a detachment from the Fourth Cavalry and Forty-First Infantry at Fort Concho convoyed nine separate (cattle) herds without a loss" (Smith 1999:111).

CONSTRUCTION AT FORT CONCHO
Fort Concho was part of a third series of frontier forts running roughly north and south from
Fort Richardson near Jacksboro, Texas, through Fort Concho (San Angelo, Texas) to Fort
Duncan on the Rio Grande (Figure 2-1). This unwalled, post-Civil War frontier fort was built at
the junction of the North and South Concho rivers along the route of the Goodnight-Loving
cattle trail after the U.S. Army abandoned Fort Chadbourne, about 45 miles northeast of Fort
Concho, due to lack of potable water (Bell et al. 1980:7, 11).
When Texas became a state in 1845, there was no federal land within its borders, a marked
departure from the manner in which other western states were incorporated into the Union.
Texas retained title to its public lands as a result of the negotiations during the debate over
statehood. The federal government had two objections to Texas becoming part of the Union:

slavery and the debt the Republic of Texas had incurred as an independent nation. The United
States government determined that the state would be held liable for the debt, but that, in return,
Texas would retain title to all its land. "This was a legacy of the Spanish colonial and Mexican
federal experience when provinces, rather than the central government, controlled public lands"
(Smith 1999:78). The 1,400 acres ofland on which Fort Concho would be built was leased by
the U.S. government from the Adams and Wickes freighting company for two hundred dollars
per month, one of the less complicated and less expensive lease agreements between private
interests in Texas and the federal government (Smith 1999:80).
Originally called Camp Hatch, the post name was changed to Camp Kelley in January 1868 and
to Fort Concho in March 1868. The fort was built of native limestone quarried several miles
south of the site and boasted up to 40 buildings on 1,400 acres. German stonemasons from
Fredericksburg, about 145 miles away, laid the cornerstones for most of the buildings over a
period of several years. Construction was then completed in stages by the soldiers (Figure 2-2).
All construction materials, except for the limestone and some pecan wood from the immediate
area, were transported from the commissary and quartermaster depot in San Antonio, 270 miles

southeast (Brown et al. 1998:29). Construction at Fort Concho was typical of building projects
at other U.S. Army forts during this period. "Although the post-Civil War construction program
was sufficient to create reasonable living condition at the posts, there were cases ... where the
lack of a grand design or long-term planning created a waste of resources, time, and money"
(Smith 1999:95). Two factors in particular contributed to construction problems at Fort
Concho: financing through congressional appropriation and the frequent turnover of fort
commanders.
In the summer of 1872, the chief quartermaster of Texas sent a civilian work force from San
Antonio to Fort Concho. These workers spent three months cutting limestone by hand and
chopping raw timber for use in a sawmill that wouldn't be in operation until November. To
further complicate matters, the fort site was changed from the south bank of the North Concho
River to the junction of the North and Middle Concho rivers. Due to a lack of wagons, none of
the cut limestone or timber could be moved to the new location of the fort. During this time
period, no fort buildings were constructed, but the federal government incurred the expense of
$27 ,34 7 in wages paid to the laborers with "little to show for the outlay" (Smith 1999:95).
Typical for U.S. Army construction practices of the period, a local quartermaster officer,
Captain David W. Porter, served as a general contractor for Fort Concho construction,
responsible for purchasing materials, organizing transportation and hiring a civilian foreman to
oversee the work. Porter was responsible for transporting building supplies by ox cart from the
Texas Gulf Coast to the fort; at one point, some of these supplies sat idle at Fort Concho for a
period of time "because of the difficulty he encountered in bringing enough labor to the remote
site" in a timely manner. By January of 1868, the foundation of "just one permanent building,
the commissary storehouse ... " was in place. The number of workers increased in the summer
1868, and, by the time of Porter's death in October 1871, the fort boasted eight stone buildings
and a stone corral. The eight buildings included two company-sized barracks, officers' quarters,
commissary and quartermaster storehouses and the hospital (Smith 1999:95-96). Construction
was halted in 1872, according to the post surgeon of the time, due to the "Misguided policy of
the holders of the purse strings." Post Surgeon William M. Notson wrote:
"Mechanics have been collected far and wide in the country, at
great trouble and expense, they have been kept but half employed
during the winter, in preparation for the more favorable building
season, and yet, as that season opens, they are discharged and
scattered, for the want of a small appropriation. After a few months,
work may go on again, but the men will be far from where they are
needed, the material will have deteriorated, the favorable season
wasted, and the stigma of waste and extravagance fastened stronger
upon the army by this illusion, and yet the subject is beyond army
control" (Smith 1999:96).

6

Also contributing to the inefficiency of the fort building program was the high turnover rate of
fort commanders. From 1867 to 1871, Fort Concho had twelve commanding officers. Each
commander had his own ideas of how the construction should proceed, "uniformly caus(ing)
much time and labor, and of course money, to be expended by the power of the hour, in undoing
some of the labor of his predecessor" (Smith 1999:96).
FORT CONCHO AND THE "INDIAN PROBLEM"
The frontier fort concept originated with President James Monroe's policy of 1825 which
established lines of military posts to create a "Permanent Indian Frontier" to separate Indians
and white settlers. The United States government's solution to its "Indian problem" of the time
was to move eastern tribes to the American plains west of the 95th meridian and use the frontier
forts as a line of demarcation between the U.S. and the "domestic dependent nations" of the
Native American tribes. Fighting that erupted between the transported Eastern tribes and the
Plains Indians who already inhabited the area ended as a result of the Indians themselves
agreeing in their own councils to end the conflict. The U.S. government was not a participant in
these negotiations (Bell et al. 1980:5-6).
While the Eastern tribes generally ended their hostilities, the Plains Indians, including the
Comanches, Kiowa, Kickapoo and Apache, continued ranging through West Texas. These
tribes watched more white settlers move into and through the area on their way to the California
gold fields and the continued decimation of one of the staples of their livelihood: the buffalo.
They stepped up their raids on settlements, ranches and farms both in the U.S. Southwest and in
Mexico. One of the major trails in Texas used by the Comanches to raid into Mexico crossed
the confluence of the North and South Concho rivers. The site was also a "pivotal point" for the
Kickapoo in Mexico and the Apache further west (Bell et al. 1980:8). The future site of Fort
Concho was relatively well-watered and, therefore, well-traveled in an otherwise desolate and
hostile environment.
There were two approaches to defeating the marauding Indians:
The Republic of Texas years (1836 to 1845) saw intermittent use of the Texas Mounted
Volunteers and Gunmen to protect frontier citizens first in the area between the Brazos and
Trinity rivers and, as settlements moved west, throughout Texas. These quasi-official
volunteers later evolved into the Texas Rangers.
"During most of the nineteenth century, (the Rangers) were
one of the most colorful, efficient, and deadly band of irregular
partisans; their best defense was to attack, dominate, and
subdue. The U.S. Army disliked the Ranger operations, and
the Rangers grew to hold the Army in increasing contempt.
Fueling such sentiments were the differing strategies pursued
by these two forces: the Army tried to police the frontier while
the Rangers rode to punish the Indians." (Brown et al. 1998:22)
7

Use of both institutions generally had ended the hostilities in Texas by the late 1850's. However, the coming of the Civil War and the secession of Texas from the Union resulted in the
abandonment of the frontier forts by the U.S. Anny. Able-bodied men of fighting age also left
the area to join the Confederate Army. Indian raids increased in number and intensity. The end
of the war saw the forts regarrisoned by Union soldiers but they were ill-equipped and the
majority of soldiers were sent to larger cities to enforce martial law in the chaos of the postCivil War era. "During the first two years after the war (on the frontier), Indians killed 162
settlers and carried forty-five into captivity. There were 3,672 soldiers in Texas by 1869, but
only 581 of these were distributed among Forts Richardson, Griffin and Concho" (Bell et al.
1980:7).
Fort Concho, constructed as an open or unstockaded fort, served throughout its history as more
of an offensive staging area rather than a defensive frontier fort. For example, the fort and its
soldiers played a pivotal role in two important confrontations with the Indians nowhere near the
fort itself: the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon in 1874 near the present location of Canyon, Texas,
and the defeat of the Apache chiefVictorio in Mexico, 1879-80.
In June 1874, the charismatic Comanche chief Quanah Parker and a combined force of
approximately 700 Comanche, Kiowa, Arapaho and Cheyenne warriors had attacked and been
defeated by fewer than thirty white buffalo hunters at Adobe Walls near today's Borger, Texas.
Quanah and his warriors had been incensed at the slaughter of more than four million buffalo in
the two-year period between 1872 and 1874; they decided to stop, once-and-for-all, the white
man's incursion into their lands. But the white hunters were marksmen with superior firepower
and unlimited ammunition. They killed fifteen Indians and wounded many more, including
Quanah, and ended the attack. The Indians retreated "disillusioned and bitter." In retribution
over the increased Indian raids following Adobe Walls, the Army began the Red River War
whose sole purpose was nothing less than the defeat of the Southern Plains tribes "for all time"
(Haley 1985:16).
Soon after the Adobe Walls battle, Colonel Ranald S. MacKenzie of Fort Concho assembled
600 cavalry and infantry soldiers at Fort Concho and headed north to the Panhandle. There they
combined with units from New Mexico, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and Fort Sill, Indian
Territory, to attack a large Comanche encampment in Palo Duro Canyon. There were
relatively few casualties on either side, but the soldiers slaughtered or confiscated as many as
1,000 Indian horses, virtually eradicating the Comanches as a fighting force. Without horses,
with the coming of winter and the buffalo in the area practically gone, most of the Indians
retired to reservation life (Haley 1985: 16).
Fort Concho's second contribution to ending the Indian wars was its role in the death of Apache
ChiefVictorio in Mexico in October 1880. Victorio and about 300 Warm Springs and
Chiricahua Apaches had escaped from the San Carlos Reservation in eastern Arizona in 1877.
Most were returned to the reservation almost immediately, but Victorio and about eighty
warriors eluded capture and, joined by other renegade warriors, began an extensive three-year
campaign of terror in Old and New Mexico and in Arizona. In March 1880, five troops of the
10th Cavalry under the command of Colonel Benjamin H. Grierson of Fort Concho rode from
8

West Texas to disarm the Mescalero reservation at Tularosa, New Mexico, thought to be
Victorio's source of supply and reinforcements. Combining with the 9th Cavalry, Grierson's
men confiscated a few guns and the reservation was occupied by soldiers for a short time.
Victorio had narrowly escaped several days prior to the Tularosa raid in the Battle of Hembrillo
Canyon. The Indian attacks continued, but Victorio retreated into Old Mexico after being
wounded in May. Grierson's troops were then stationed along the U.S.-Mexican border and
their primary job was to deprive the Apaches of access to water once they entered Texas.
Victorio was routed twice by Grierson's forces, once at Tinaja de las Palmas in Quitman Canyon
in July and again in August at Rattlesnake Springs in the Sierra Diablo Mountains. Both times,
Victorio retreated back to Mexico. In September, Grierson and some of his troops guarded the
Rio Grande while others from his force combined with units from Arizona and New Mexico
entered Old Mexico to attack Victorio on what had become his home ground. The U.S. forces
were turned back by the Mexican Army. Under the command of Colonel Joaquin Terrazas, the
Mexican forces attacked and killed Victorio in the Castillo Mountains in October. Those of his
warriors who survived moved west into Sonora, Mexico, and Arizona to fight with Nana and
later with Geronimo. The death ofVictorio ended the Indian threat in West Texas and was the
beginning of the end for Fort Concho's official Army capacity in the area.
THE U.S. ARMY AT FORT CONCHO

From Fort Concho's establishment until its closing in 1889, units representing five regiments of
cavalry and ten regiments of infantry were assigned to the post (Haley 1985:18). The cavalry
units were the 3rd, the 4th, the 8th, and the 9th and 10th (Buffalo soldier regiments). The
infantry units were the 10th, the 11th, the 16th, the 17th, the 19th, and the 24th and the 25th
(Buffalo soldier regiments), the 35th, the 38th and the 41st (early Buffalo Soldier regiments).
Reports do not indicate which regiments or companies occupied Barracks 1 and 2 (the focus of
this investigation and report) at any given time (Fort Concho Library, vertical files:1999).
All six enlisted men's barracks at Fort Concho consisted oflinear dormitory units with perpendicular mess hall and kitchen wings; this construction is consistent with other forts of the
Indian Wars period. Barracks 1 and 2 were cavalry barracks and were first occupied in August
1869 after numerous construction delays. They were the first enlisted men's barracks to be built
(Bell et al. 1980:102). Figure 2-3 presents a visual history of Barracks 2 as it appeared in 1878,
in 1908-10 and in 1997.
Barracks 1 and 2 were both constructed with limestone walls and wood-truss roofs with wood
purlins and nailers. The barracks had wood-shingled hip roofs, stone fireplaces, roof ventilators, symmetrical door and window arrangements, both enclosed ceilings and open ceiling
spaces, with nine-foot porticos on the dormitory units. Both had two dormitory units joined
under one roof by a twelve-foot wide sallyport (Bell et al. 1980:102). Cavalrymen would ride
or lead their horses through the sallyports to the corrals and stables located behind the barracks.
Barracks 1 and 2 were the only barracks built on the post specifically for the cavalry. Barracks
1 had a mess hall wing behind each of the dormitory units. Barracks 2 only had one mess hall
wing behind it. Floors were made of wood. Porches were not floored in the original

construction, but were floored with wooden planks in later years. The barracks buildings were
used as living quarters for the enlisted men, but at various times also served as a dance hall,
chapel, school and library (Bell et al. 1980: 102).
Historically, the creation of segregated African-American U.S. Army units during the Civil War
had been a successful experiment. Commanded by white officers, more than 180,000 black
soldiers served "with distinction" in the war, several units had outstanding combat records and
thirty-two Medals of Honor were awarded to individual soldiers (Brown et al. 1989:40).
Desertion was a significant problem in the Army following the war, but not in the black units.
"In 1867, for example, one-quarter of the entire U.S. Army deserted, as compared to four
percent of black troops." In 1870, about ten percent of the U.S. Army was comprised of
African-American units (Brown et al. 1989:41 ).
After the war, both cavalry and infantry units of black soldiers were assigned to Fort Concho
and other West Texas frontier forts. The first Buffalo Soldiers, the 9th Cavalry and the 4lst
Infantry, arrived at Fort Concho in mid-March 1869. From April 1869 to May 1870 and from
August 1877 to November 1880, Buffalo Soldiers comprised the entire enlisted complement of
the fort. In April 18 7 5, Fort Concho was designated as headquarters for the 10th Cavalry. A
scouting expedition of Buffalo soldiers from the 10th Cavalry and the 24th and 25th Infantry
was assigned the responsibility in July 1875 of extensively mapping the plains of West Texas.
"(They) reported favorably on the resources of the region, resulting in the first large influx of
ranchers;" this effort "was the most important (survey) made and served until 1888 as the major
source of information about the area." From 1869 to 1890, the Buffalo Soldiers were awarded
fourteen Medals of Honor, nine Certificates of Merit and twenty-nine Orders of Honorable
Mention. They served "with honor" in nearly 200 major and minor engagements against the
Indians (Brown et al. 1989:43, 44, 46). As noted Western author and long-time San Angelo
resident Elmer Kelton put it: "It was the black trooper's role to take the land away from the red
man so the white man could have it" (Lowry 1989:47).
In the intervening years between the defeat ofVictorio in 1880 and the closing of Fort Concho
in 1889, soldiers continued to map and patrol the region and build roads. The coming of the
railroad to West.Texas between 1880 and 1883 (1888 in San Angelo) greatly reduced the need
for the scattered frontier forts (Brown et al. 1998:9). An Indian attack in Ballinger, for example,
could be countered within hours by troops railed in from San Antonio, according to Robert
Broene, Fort Concho Museum guide. The U.S. Census of 1890 concluded that, by that time,
there was no longer "a discemable frontier in the United States" (Broene, personal communication 2000). As a result of these factors and because the Army was moving its Indian focus from
Texas west to Arizona and New Mexico and north to the Dakotas, approximately eighty percent
of the Army forts in Texas were closed. Fort Concho was officially closed on June 20, 1889
(Brown et al. 1998:39-40).

FORT CONCHO'S "CIVILIAN LIFE"

Occupied immediately by local citizens after being "closed" by the U.S. Army, the various
buildings of Fort Concho became private residences, warehouses, hotels and apartment complexes (Haley 1985 :C-7) (Figure 2-4) and were acquired piecemeal over the years by the City of
San Angelo. This continuous use of the buildings is cited as one reason for the fort's excellent
physical.condition today. In 1961, Fort Concho was registered as a National Historic Landmark
and as a Texas Historic Landmark, and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
Barracks 2 itself was leased by private citizens for business use after the U.S. Army departed.
In 1929, Higginbotham Brothers and Company purchased a portion of the fort including
Barracks 2. Barracks 1 and 2 were then purchased in 1959 by the Monarch Tile Company,
whose offices were located on the Oakes Street side of the fort. Both barracks buildings were
incorporated into its operation and doors were cut into the barracks' northern walls which
adjoined the tile facility. Barrack~ 1 and 2 were purchased by the City of San Angelo in 1981
for the purpose of making them part of the Fort Concho proper once again. The buildings were
used for a time by the fort for storage and carpentry shops. The city then temporarily rented the
two buildings to the M-System Company and, later, arranged various short-term leases with
other local businesses. Following that, the City of San Angelo rented the buildings to the
Fixture Concepts Company from 1991to1998. Fort Concho then reacquired use of the
buildings. Renovation of Barracks 1 into the fort's Visitor Center, fort offices and Sutler's Store
(gift shop) was completed in 1995. Restoration and reconstruction of Barracks 2 began in
August 1997 and was largely completed by 1999. Work on the building's north porch was still
in progress at the time of publication of this report.
Fort Concho Elementary School was constructed on the Parade Ground in 1908 and demolished
in 1987. The school was rebuilt that same year behind the row of Officers' Quarters and near
the reconstructed fort Hospital. The Hospital, completed in 1987, was rebuilt on its original
foundation after extensive archeological and architectural investigation. The foundation was
excavated by fort staff and volunteers from 1984 to 1986.
Fort Concho is now comprised of twenty-two original and restored or reconstructed buildings
and one stabilized ruin. Plans for the fort include removal of two modem city streets to restore
the Parade Ground to its original appearance and the completion of the company street on the
east and north sides of the Parade Ground. Also planned is the reconstruction of Barracks and
Mess Halls 3 and 4 (currently open ground), the Guardhouse, Bandstand and Post Surgeon's
Quarters next to the Hospital. There is a plan to eventually rebuild Officers' Quarters 5, which
is now a stabilized ruin and serves as an example of frontier construction techniques.
An estimated 65,000 to 75,000 visitors tour Fort Concho every year, according to Robert F.
Bluthardt, Fort Concho Executive Director. The fort, a department of the City of San Angelo
since 1955, is administered by a fifteen-member board of directors and has a permanent staff of
fourteen. As many as 1,500 volunteers donate more than 30,000 hours annually as docents and
for the fort's living history, education, buildings and grounds, and special events activities.

"The number of volunteers is particularly impressive when you consider that the population of
San Angelo is fewer than 100,000 people," explained Bluthardt.
Fort Concho is the annual site of Frontier Day during the City of San Angelo's Fiesta del
Concho in June. Christmas at Old Fort Concho each December is a popular three-day local
event, which was attended by an estimated 20,000 people in 1999.
Figures 2-5 through 2-10 show the fort as it appears in March 2000.

Chapter 3: ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION

The restoration of Fort Concho's Barracks 2 began in August 1997. Figure 3-1 is a photograph
showing the building prior to renovation and the grading of the surrounding area. Figure 3-2 is
a drawing illustrating the location of the loading dock and concrete driveway to be removed and
the area east and south of the barracks to be graded. Figure 3-3 shows the grading of the area
south of the building. Figure 3-4 illustrates features located during renovation, including the
original porch footings to the east of Barracks 2.
The project did not include any work on the north side of the original building due to the fact
that the entire side had been incorporated at an earlier date into the Monarch Tile Plant building.
(NOTE: Since completion of the project, however, the two buildings have been separated and
the porch on the north side is in the process of being rebuilt.)

Figure 3-3. Barracks 2 - South Grading

Due to the time constraints of working with the construction company, it was decided to limit
screening of disturbed soil to the following footings: F3 and F5 to the west, and F8, FlO, F12,
Fl4, F15, Fl6, F18, F20, F21, F23, F24, F26, F28, F30 and F32 to the south. See Figure 3-5.
All footings were a standard fourteen inches wide with the exception of F26. A small hole was
dug north of F26 to expose a profile that showed that the footing extended to a maximum depth
of six inches. The F26 footing was eight feet six and one-half inches south of the south wall
and extended to nine feet one inch from the wall, making this footing seven and one-half inches
wide. No artifacts were found in the profile hole which was comprised of hard-packed gravel
with a caliche base (Figure 3-6).
The ground to the west, south, and east of the barracks was graded to an elevation of 1,842 feet,
8 3/4 inches above sea level. Soil removed from the grading to the west and south of the barracks was screened, as was the soil from the trench (Ton Figure 3-4) dug when the loading
dock and driveway were removed. All soil was screened using one-quarter-inch and oneeighth-inch screens. All soil removal was monitored.
Master Builders Construction subcontracted the grading of the area around Barracks 2 to Reece
Albert, Inc., of San Angelo. A front-end loader with teeth was used to remove one and one-half
inches of asphalt from Wool Street at the east end of the building and cement curbs from East
Avenue C (Figure 3-4). The area of excavated asphalt and curbing measured eighty-one feet
(from East Avenue C north towards East Avenue B) by thirty-seven feet six inches. No soil
screening was done; only the asphalt and cement from the east end of the building were
removed and little or no soil was disturbed.

Figure 3-6. View of Footing 26 (F26) Profile Hole

Using the same front-end loader, Reece Albert, Inc., then removed the concrete loading dock.
Sledge hammers were used to remove the concrete immediately adjacent to Barracks 2. The
dock had measured fourteen feet one inch by four feet six inches by one foot, centered on the
overhead door on the east wall. Trench (T) (Figure 3-4) became the designation for the soil
beneath the dock and measured fourteen feet one inch by four feet six inches by two feet,
approximately one front-end loader bucketful or 855 pounds of soil. The soil profile consisted
of a pinkish caliche-colored mortar mix at the top, medium sandy brown soil in the middle and
sterile soil at the bottom of the trench. This soil had been disturbed during construction (date
unknown) of the dock and driveway.
The asphalt driveway that extended from the dock to Wool Street was removed next with the
front-end loader. The driveway measured fourteen feet one inch at the dock and extended five
feet one inch to Wool Street where its width measured seventeen feet nine inches at its widest
dimension. Removal of the driveway exposed a portion of the original limestone rock footing.
The remains of the footing measured two feet three inches south to north and one foot two and
one-half inches west to east and was determined to be part of the missing twenty-three feet six
inches of the east end of the building. Although no documentation has been discovered that
indicates exactly when the building was shortened by this twenty-three feet six inches, it is
generally accepted by fort personnel that the change was made to accommodate the extension of
Wool Street from East Avenue B to East Avenue C. Since the completion of the Barracks 2
project, Wool Street now terminates at East Avenue Band allows access to a parking lot.
24

Figure 3-7 shows the loading dock and driveway prior to renovation. The figure also shows the
limestone footing at the southeast comer of the original construction.
The top soil four feet five inches north and four feet five inches south of the old driveway was
graded to allow construction of a foundation pad that would accommodate the rebuilding of the
missing portion of the barracks. A second lower limestone footing was then exposed east of the
first footing. This second footing measured two feet south to north and three feet eight inches
west to east. Beginning at the east edge of the lower footing, the ground surface was scraped
four feet five inches to the south and ten feet one and one-half inches to the east toward old
Wool Street. To the northeast of the existing building was a chain-link fence four feet eight
inches at a diagonal west to east by seventeen feet ten inches south to north. Top soil was
removed from the area to the east of the fence line. An area that had been greatly disturbed was
found northeast of the existing Barracks 2 north wall. One large foundation stone was located
five feet one inch east on a line with the north wall. All original fooings were left in place. The
Wool Street/E. Avenue C street sign on the southwest of the intersection was also removed.
No artifacts were found during the excavation of Wool Street or the area beneath and to the
north and south of the driveway or during the removal of the street sign. Artifacts were located
in the Trench (T) beneath the loading dock. Refer to Chapter 4 for a discussion of the
recovered artifacts.
The scraped areas were covered with crushed caliche to build the street, driveway and loading
dock areas up to a level where the foundation pad could be poured to rebuild the missing east
end of the barracks (Figure 3-8). A crew from West Texas Utilities removed an electrical pole
northeast of the north wall; no artifacts were found.
On the south side of Barracks 2, workers for Reece Albert used the architect's specifications to
mark the locations for twenty-six separate footings for the outer porch perimeter. Using a frontend loader and backhoe blade, workers scraped the ground south from the building's south wall
to the edge of East A venue C to ground level. The soil profile consisted of the following:
Level 1 - grass in top soil, Level 2 - caliche fill, and Level 3 - a medium brown fill mix that
showed disturbed levels dating to the post-Fort Concho era.
Some rockfall from construction of the original south wall was noted. In the caliche fill, areas
of ground-up reddish pink brick were found near the sallyport. At this point, areas of original
limestone rock footings for the porch on the south side of Barracks 2 were discovered (Figure
3-9). A well-defined solid line of limestone was exposed extending thirty-eight feet in a
continuous run. This continuous run began at one-hundred-seven feet nine inches eastward from
the southwest comer of the building and extended west to east from footing F20 through F26
extending east to the area between F26 and F27 (not including F27). The footing was found
twelve and one-quarter inches deep, measured from the top of the south wall's footing.
Additional footings appeared at eleven feet, thirteen feet, ninety-four feet three inches, onehundred-seven feet nine inches, one-hundred-twenty-two feet and one hundred-forty-four feet
from the southwest comer of the barracks. The footing extended on the north edge eight feet to

three feet six and one-half inches to nine feet one inch on the south edge, giving the footings
widths that varied from six and one-half inches to thirteen inches. Original limestone was
missing from footings F7, F13, FlS, Fl6, F21, F27, F30, and F32 (See Figure 3-5). The
ground area between the footings and the south wall appeared to be hard-packed gravel.
Figure 3-10 illustrates the detail of these findings.
When the continuous run of footing rocks to the south of Barracks 2 was exposed (Figure 3-9),
all grading was halted until architect Henry Schmidt could be consulted. Schmidt, Fort Concho
Executive Director Robert F. Bluthardt, the building contractor and staff archeologist Kathleen
Roland met and decided that the architect should rework his plans to incorporate the newly
exposed footing into the concrete form footings that would be a part of the reconstruction of the
south side porch. The Texas Historical Commission was also notified of the discovery of the
footing.
The architect had originally planned to pour twenty-six one-foot-wide concrete footings
extending nine feet one inch perpendicular from the building's south wall to the end of the porch
perimeter. Incorporation of the original footing required shortening the concrete footings by
fourteen inches. The trenches for the concrete forms for the new footings were dug at slightly
larger widths to accommodate the concrete forms.
The grading of the west end of the barracks yielded three rock porch footings, Fl, F2, and F3.
Fl was located at a depth of ten and three-quarters inches, eight feet one and one-half inches on
the east edge to nine feet one inch on the west edge, making the footing eleven and one-half
inches by seven inches. The north edge of the footing was one foot nine inches and the south
edge was two feet eight and one-half inches from the south wall of the Monarch Tile Plant to
the north of Barracks 2 (Figure 3-11). F2 was a twelve-and-one-half-inch-square limestone
rock found at a depth of twelve and three-eighths inches from the top of the west wall footing.
Its north edge was twelve feet eleven inches and its south edge was thirteen feet eleven and onehalf inches from the south wall of the Monarch Tile Plant to the south of Fl.

F3 was the first footing uncovered during the grading of the west side of the barracks and was,
unfortunately, pushed out of alignment by the Reece Albert grader before it was realized that it
was an original footing. This twelve-inch-wide footing's north edge was located twenty-five
feet two inches and the south edge was twenty-six feet twenty-one inches from the south wall of
the Monarch Tile Plant. The grading to the west of the barracks yielded only a small number of
artifacts as outlined in Chapter 4.
A total of thirty-eight footing trenches were dug for the porches on the west, south and east
sides of the barracks. Figure 3-5 shows the orientation of the footings on the south and west
sides: twenty-six footings to the south and five footings and one "chicken-foot shaped comer
footing" to the west (Figure 3-12). On the east side of the building, five trenches and a second
"chicken-foot shaped corner footing" were dug into the caliche fill that was brought in to bring
the area up to grade level (Figure 3-8).

During excavation, the soil to the northwest of Barracks 2 was found to be contaminated by
lead. At the request of the city, SK Engineering of San Angelo tested the lead content of the
soil from the Trench (T). This work delayed screening for a week until analysis of the soil
could be completed. Results showed low levels of lead that required the soil screening crew to
wear masks and gloves as precautionary measures.

Chapter 4: ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS

A total of 3,978 artifacts weighing 15,567.45 grams were recovered from Fort Concho National
Historic Landmark's Barracks 2 archeological investigation.
Artifacts were categorized according to use, the same system that was used by Brown, Zapata
and Moses in their 1998 Camp Elizabeth report. Seven major categories were used in this
report and are discussed in the following order: activities artifacts, construction artifacts,
domestic artifacts, faunal remains, personal artifacts, workshop artifacts and miscellaneous
artifacts.
Glass, a difficult group to analyze in this case because of fragmentation, was categorized as
domestic or grouped into more specific use categories. For example, window glass was
designated as a construction artifact and a glass marble as an activity artifact. Jars were listed
under bottles in the domestic activities category but broken down further by more specific
descriptions.
Artifacts throughout this report are designated according to the location where they were
recovered and by the order in which they were found. For example, artifact B2-F12-18 would
be the designation for an artifact found in or at Barracks 2 (B2) at or near footing 12 (F12). The
number 18 indicates that it was the eighteenth artifact catalogued from that location.
Table 4-1 breaks down the percentage of artifacts by category and Table 4-2, by material. The
appendix is a tabulation of each artifact, indicating its description, the location of where it was
found by excavation area and depth, its designated artifact category, its total weight and the
number of pieces, where applicable. The "Diagnostic" column indicates with an "X" whether
the artifact can be assigned to a specific date or time period.

ACTIVITIES ARTIFACTS
Artifacts in this category include items associated with firearms, writing and recreational
activities. A miscellaneous artifacts subcategory is included in the activities category. A total
of fifty-two activity artifacts and/or fragments were found (1.31 percent of all artifacts) for a
total weight of 489.06 grams (3.14 percent of the weight of all artifacts) (Table 4-1).

Firearm Artifacts
Firearm-related artifacts include the weapons themselves as well as cartridges, shotgun shells
(also referred to as shotshells), bullets, percussion caps and primers, lead splatters and blanks.
No weapons or fragments of weapons were found during the reconstruction of Barracks 2.
Cartridges
Ten cartridges were recovered from the excavation. Figure 4-1 illustrates the headstamps used
to identify the cartridges recovered at the Barracks 2 site and indicates the quantity of each that
were found. Eight rifle, carbine or pistol cartridges were found, as follows: one .22 caliber
short, one .38 caliber, three .45/70's, one .45 Colt and two .50/70's. Two cartridges were
shotgun shells (Figure 4-2) .
.22 Caliber-Short Cartridge
One .22-caliber short cartridge (B2-F20-5) was recovered. It is a rim fire and made of copper
with no headstamp. These cartridges were available commercially for gallery practice as early
as the 1880's (Cheek 1977:62) and loaded with a very light charge of smokeless powder (Logan
1959:62) .
.38-Caliber Cartridge
One .3 8-caliber cartridge (B2-T-2) was recovered. Made of aluminum, the cartridge is a center
fire with a headstamp of "FEDERAL 38 SPL+P". The designation ".38 SPL" indicates a
.38-special cartridge and the "+P" indicates an extra load. The cartridge is from the Federal
Cartridge Company, probably dating from after 1920, far later than the fort period (Robert
Broene: Personal communication 1999) .
.45-Caliber Cartridge
Both .45 and .45/70 cartridges were excavated at the barracks.
In 1873, the U.S. Army adopted the .45-caliber cartridge as its official rifle and carbine round
for the single-shot Springfield rifle and carbine (Cheek 1977:64). The .45-caliber government
cartridge with 70 grains of powder (designated the .45/70) was the standard infantry issue for
rifles for the Fort Concho period. From 1873 to 1877, these .45/70's were internally primed and
without headstamps. Beginning in March 1877, the .45/70 internally primed cartridges were

marked with either an "R" for rifle or a "C" for carbine and carried headstamps with the month,
year and location of manufacture; for example, an "F" indicated the cartridge was made at the
Frankford Arsenal, which manufactured the cartridges between 1877 and 1882. From 1882 to
1886, manufacturers switched to externally primed .45/70 cartridges also headstamped with an
"R" or "C" and the month and date of manufacture. After 1886, the externally primed .45/70
cartridges did not carry the "R" or "C" designations (Cheek 1977:64) .
.45170 Cartridge
Three .45/70 cartridges were recovered. Two are rifle cartridges: B2-F21-67 and B2-F26-1 are
made of copper and externally primed with headstamps indicating manufacture in February
1886 at the Frankford Arsenal. The third .45/70 cartridge (B2-T-43) has no headstamp and was
produced between 1873 and 1877 (Cheek 1977:64) .
. 45-Colt Cartridge
One .45-Colt revolver cartridge (B2-F20-6) is stamped with "U.M.C . .45 COLT". This
pre-1912 cartridge was manufactured by the Union Metallic Cartridge Company before its
merger with Remington in 1912 (Remington-Union Metallic Cartridge Company: Personal
communication 1999).
35

.50170 Cartridge

The .50-caliber bullet with 70 grains of powder (commonly known as the .50/70 cartridge) was
standard U.S. Army issue from 1870 to 1873.
Two .50/70 caliber cartridges (B2-F12-11 and B2-F24-48) were recovered from the excavation.
They are both made of copper and are center fire and internally primed without headstamps,
indicating they were manufactured before 1877 (Robert Broene: Personal communication
1999).
Shotgun Shells (Shotshells)
Two shotgun shells were recovered from Barracks 2, one 12 gauge and one 20 gauge.
12-Gauge Shell

The 12-gauge shotgun shell (B2-F21-14) was a partially flattened, brass casing for a Winchester
shotgun. The shell has a headstamp with the designation "WINCHESTER NO. 12 LEADER".
The Leader No. 12 shotgun shell was manufactured by Winchester Firearms from 1894 to 1943
(Stadt 1984:38).
20-Gauge Shell

The 20-gauge shotgun shell (B2-F21-41) is a brass Remington shell with a headstamp that reads
"REM UMC NO 20 SHURSHOT". This cartridge still has remnants of its paper jacket. The
Remington-Union Metallic Cartridge Company dates this shotgun shell from between 1920 and
1930; the company discontinued use of the SHURSHOT name in 1930 (Remington-Union
Metallic Cartridge Company: Personal communication 1999).
Bullets
Only one lead bullet was recovered from the excavation. B2-T-3 is a .50-caliber conical,
flat-nosed bullet with 350.9 grains of powder for a Spencer Repeating Rifle, a common rifle
used during the Civil War and Indian Wars periods (1860's through the 1870's) (Flayderman
1998:512-513). This would have been a common rifle during the Fort Concho era.
Percussion Caps and Primers
No percussion caps or primers were found during the excavation of Barracks 2.
Lead Splatters
Eight lead splatters and fragments of splatters, weighing a total 185 .9 grams, were uncovered
during the reconstruction (Figure 4-3). Lead splatters were the result of hot liquid lead being
36

spilled during the bullet-making process. Reloading and bullet-making were common chores
for fort soldiers (Kathleen S. Roland: Personal knowledge of fort history).
Blanks
No blanks were found in this excavation.
Writing Artifacts
Ink Bottle
A multi-sided conical shaped bottle of aqua glass was recovered (Figure 4-4). B2-F12-18 is an
incomplete (sixteen fragments) "umbrella"-style ink bottle with a short round neck, a thick
shoulder ring and an eight-sided polygon base. Umbrella-style ink bottles were blown in
full-size, multi-piece molds for pattern and shape. They normally came in six- or eight-sided
shapes and were manufactured in the United States from 1865 to 1900 (Spillman 1983:122).

Recreational Artifacts

Harmonica Reed
B2-F20-3A and B are two pieces of a bent and broken brass reed for an harmonica (Figure 4-5).
There are no identifying marks on the reed, but similar harmonica reeds have been found in
previous Fort Concho archeological excavations and have been identified as from the fort period (Kathleen S. Roland: Personal knowledge from Mess Hall 3 and Barracks 4 excavations).

Parts of Toys
Two ceramic toy doll parts and two ceramic parts of toy tea sets were found at Barracks 2
(Figure 4-5). B2-F21-59 is a brown, under-glazed ceramic fragment that could be part of a doll,
and B2-F24-29 is a portion of a molded, porcelain doll face. B2-F3-10 is a partial porcelain,
molded toy cup base and side with broken handle. B2-F21-12 is a part of a curved porcelain,
molded toy pitcher or toy tea pot with remnants of handle attachments.
These toys had no specifically identifying marks and are most probably from the period after the
fort was abandoned in 1889.

Marbles
Seven individual marbles weighing 30.3 grams were identified from the excavation (Figure
4-6). Six marbles are made of glass and one is of clay.
Three of the glass marbles are of the type known as "slag" marbles, made from the multicolored chips of glass (slag) left over from the day's run at a marble factory. These marbles
have been dated from anywhere from the 1920's or 1930's through the present (Ron Howe:
Personal communication 1999). The three slag marbles are B2-F16-9, an orange and yellow
swirled marble with black lines; B2-F18-14, a green, purple, yellow and orange swirled marble;
and B2-F20-13, a blue and white swirled marble.
B2-F20-21 is comprised of three fragments ofred, blue and white glass, probably from a larger
solid-core marble, the only solid-core glass marble recovered from Barracks 2. This marble is
possibly from the fort period. Solid-core glass marbles were commercially made by hand in
Germany from 1846 to about 1920 (Ron Howe: Personal communication 1999 and Baumann
1970:132).
39

Top row (l.eft to right): slag marble with orange and yellow swirls with black lines (B2-Fl 6-9),
slag marble with green, purple, yellow and orange swirls (B2-F18-14) and slag marble with
blue and white swirls (B2-F20-13)
Bottom row: fragments of a solid-core marble (B2-F20-21), a common solid blue marble (B2F24-1), fragment of a clear marble with a yellow center (B2-F21-53) and an unglazed clay
marble (B2-F20-15)
Figure 4-6. Marbles
B2-F24-1 is a common, solid blue glass marble made sometime between 1800 and the 1950's.
B2-F21-53 is a tiny fragment of a clear glass marble with a yellow center (not a large enough
fragment to identify by type).
B2-F20-15 is an unglazed, light brown clay marble. Clay marbles were made by hand-shaping
clay and baking them in ovens (Grist 1988:38). This marble was more than likely from the fort
period.

Playing with marbles was most likely one of the past-times spent by the individual soldier on
the frontier. Clay marbles have been found at other Fort Concho excavations (Kathleen S.
Roland: Personal knowledge from Mess Hall 3 and Barracks 4 excavations).
Miscellaneous Activities Artifacts

The only miscellaneous activities artifact recovered was B2-F18-38, a fragment of hollow
pewter molded into the shape of a squared bell. It was first thought to be a fishing sinker, but it
was determined that it would have been too heavy to serve that purpose. Its use remains
unidentified (Figure 4-5).
40

CONSTRUCTION ARTIFACTS
Construction artifacts include the following types of construction-related items: fasteners
(including hand-forged, cut and wire nails), spikes, screws, staples and bolts; door hardware;
window glass and a sample of mortar. There were a total of 2, 142 construction artifacts and/or
fragments found (53.85 percent of all artifacts) for a total weight of 8,091.80 grams (51.98
percent of the total weight of artifacts) (Table 4-1 ).

Fasteners
The most common types of fasteners used at Fort Concho were nails, screws and bolts. They
were used in building construction and repair, and for machinery and vehicle repair. According
to Cheek, there were three types of nails used at the fort: the hand-forged nail, the cut nail and
the wire nail (Cheek 1977:69-70).
In this excavation, it was impossible to differentiate hand-forged from cut nails due to the high
degree of iron corrosion. As a result, it was decided to designate all square nails as cut nails for
the purpose of this report. Also due to the heavy corrosion, the weights of most of the iron
objects (including nails) will not be exact because of excessive amounts of rust. When attempts
were made to remove the rust, the fragile artifacts and artifact fragments broke apart or were
otherwise damaged.
Nails
Historically, commercial nails were sold in lots. A certain number of nails could be bought for
a penny. For example, 100 small-sized nails sold for one penny. This price was indicated at the
blacksmith's bin by a "d" (price, one penny for 100 of-this-size nail). Later, 8d and 1Od were
used to denote prices of nails per hundred count. Due to price fluctuations, "this significance
was lost" but the term was retained to designate length (Tremont Nail Company sample kit
1997). The designations, lengths and typical uses for the nails excavated from Fort Concho's
Barracks 2 are as follows:
2d equals 1 inch
3d equals 1-1/4 inches
4d equals 1-1/2 inches
5d equals 1-3/4 inches (commonly used for flooring)
6d equals 2 inches (commonly used for nailers in shingle or shake roof systems)
7d equals 2-1/4 inches (commonly used for flooring)
8d equals 2-112 inches (commonly used for flooring, siding and/or roofing)
9d equals 2-3/4 inches (commonly used for flooring, siding and/or roofing)
1Od equals 3 inches
12d equals 3-1/4 inches (commonly used for framing and ceiling joists)
16d equals 3-1/2 inches
20d equals 4 inches
40d equals 5 inches (considered a spike)
60d equals 6-1 /2 inches (considered a spike)
41

Common machine-cut nails date to ca. 1838 to 1890. Fort Concho used square-cut nails in its
initial construction; repairs and/or additions in the following years were done with wire nails
(Brown 1999:73).
A total of 548 intact nails with a total weight of 2,711.6 grams were recovered from Barracks 2.
Various nails and/or fasteners found included common, finishing and roofing nails; tin nails
used in roof flashing; box nails, slightly narrower than regular common nails; and brads and
tacks. No square-cut finishing nails were recovered.
A total of 1,390 nails and nail fragments were identified, weighing a total of 4,727.50 grams,
from in and around the barracks. Of these, 220 were square-cut nails weighing 1,128.10 grams
and 342 wire nails weighing 1,643 grams. A total of 828 nail fragments with a combined
weight of 1,956.40 grams were found; 519 were square-cut nail fragments weighing 1,288.90
grams, and 309 were wire fragments weighing 667.50 grams (Table 4-3).

Nails By Type
Nail fragments were the highest percentage type found in both cut and wire nails. A total of 828
nail fragments (59.57 percent of all nail types) with a combined weight of 1,956.40 grams
(41.38 percent of all nail weight) were found. Common nails were found to be the second
highest percentage in cut and wire nails in both number and weight. A total of 435 common cut
and wire nails were found, 31.30 percent of all nails weighing 2,3 51.15 grams (49. 73 percent of
the total weight). Roofing nails were the third highest percentage type found in cut nails:
thirty-three cut nails (2.37 percent of all nails), weighing 74.00 grams (1.57 percent of all nail
weight). However, finishing nails were the third highest in percentage of the wire nails:
fifty-eight wire finishing nails (4.17 percent of all nails) with a weight of 182.05 grams (3.85
percent of all nail weight) (Table 4-3 ).

Nail Distribution
The actual amounts by weight of cut nails versus wire nails are fairly close: cut nails totaled
53.17 percent and wire nails, 46.84 percent. Footing F20 had the highest percentage by weight
44

of nails, both cut and wire: 16.09 percent (8.76 percent cut and 7.33 percent wire). F21 had the
second highest percentage of both: 15.30 percent (6.43 percent cut and 8.87 percent wire). F18
had the third highest percentage of nails: 8.18 percent (wire only). The Trench (T) had the
highest number of nails in comparison to the individual footings, but this discrepancy must be
discounted because of the difference in area: T measured 14 feet 1 inch by 4 feet 6 inches by 2
feet, while the footings each measured 9 feet 6 inches by 12 inches by 12 inches (Table 4-6).
Spikes

The following sizes of nails were designated as spikes using the 1997 Tremont Nail Company
Catalog: 30d with a length of 4-1/2 inches, 40d with a length of 5 inches, 50d with a length of
5-1/2 inches, 60d with a length of 6 inches, 70d with a length of 7 inches and 80d with a length
of 8 inches (Tremont Nail Company Catalog 1997:20).

Ten intact spikes were recovered from the Barrack 2 reconstruction. Seven were 40d cut spikes,
two were 60d cut spikes and one was a 60d railroad spike. There were five cut spike fragments
also recovered (Table 4-7 and Figure 4-9).
Cut spikes outnumbered wire spikes at a rate of 6 to 1: 85.71 percent were cut spikes and 14.28
percent were wire spikes. Footing F18 had the highest percentage of all cut spikes by number
(28.57 percent) and by weight (48.12 percent). The Nailer had the second highest percentage
by number (21.43 percent) and by weight (13.47 percent). F23 had the third highest percentage
of spikes with 14.29 percent by number and 12.68 percent by weight. The Nailer must be
discounted in this analysis as it would be expected to have a large number of spikes for the
placement of nailers in the walls. Table 4-8 shows the distribution of spikes by excavation area.

Screws

Only two complete wood screws were found and both were most probably used for door hinge
plates. The first (B2-Fl2-5) is a Number 10 oval/rounded-head wood screw, one inch long.
The second (B2-F20-42) is a Number 12 flat-head wood screw, two inches long. There were
two screw fragments found: B2-Fl0-19 is probably a Number 10 beveled flat-head wood screw
(probable length 1-3/4 inches), most likely also used for a door hinge plate; B2-F12-3 is
probably a 1/2-inch, Number 5 metal screw used for an electrical switch plate (Melvin Bohnert:
Personal communication 1999).

Window Glass
Window glass was analyzed by thickness and weight rather than by number of pieces.
Approximately 75.0 percent of the all window glass found during the reconstruction of Barracks
2 was measured at 1.5 mm or thinner. There has been some discussion in pertinent literature
about window glass which suggests that glass that is thinner than 1.6 mm dates from before
1845 (Cheek 1977:45). It is reasonable to assume that glass from 1845 or earlier might have
been shipped to Fort Concho because the frontier would have, by common practice, received
older, warehoused building materials rather than newly manufactured glass that would more
likely be found in new construction in more populated Eastern areas.
There were 719 fragments of window glass (3 7 .31 percent of all glass found) with a total weight
of 1,267.4 grams (26.79 percent of the weight of all glass found). Twenty-four fragments (3.3
percent of all window glass) measured 0.5 mm thick at 8.5 grams (0.67 percent of all window
glass). A total of 151 fragments (21.0 percent of all window glass) measured 1.0 mm thick at
91.56 grams (7.22 percent of all window glass). Glass fragments totaling 370 (51.5 percent of
all window glass) measured 1.5 mm thick at 857.4 grams (67.65 percent of all window glass).
A total of 137 fragments (19.1 percent of all window glass) measured 2.0 mm thick at 218.34
grams (17.23 percent of all window glass). Twenty-one fragments (2.9 percent of all window
glass) measured 2.5 mm thick at 37.15 grams (2.93 percent of all window glass). Seven
48

fragments (1.0 percent of all window glass) measured 3.0 mm thick at 8.15 grams (0.64 percent
of all window glass). Nine fragments (1.2 percent of all window glass) measured 4.0 mm thick
at 46.30 grams (3.65 percent of all window glass).
Two fragments of the 3.0-mm thickness were clear on one side and white on the other and one
fragment at 1.0-mm thickness was gray. All three fragments most probably date from the postfort period, since this type of opaque privacy glass wasn't available earlier (Table 4-9).
The footing with the highest percentage by weight of window glass was F20 at 64.07 percent.
The second highest percentage was F24 with 10.21 percent. The third highest percentage was
F21 with 6.83 percent. F18 came in a close fourth with 6.58 percent.
The area around footing F20 at the southwest comer of the south sallyport, as an extra-wide
doorway, would be a likely place to find a large quantity of broken glass which, upon analysis,
would have fallen between the planks of the south porch of Barracks 2. Table 4-10 shows the
distribution of window glass by excavation area.

Miscellaneous Construction Artifacts
One 1-7/16-inch-long iron fencing staple (B2-F28-2) was found. Also uncovered were one half
of a white ceramic door knob (B2-F14-20) (Figure 4-10) and one 17-1/2-inch length of 15/16inch diameter iron rebar (B2-F22-1). Three bolts, two nuts and five washers (two of them
locking washers) were also found.
Numerous fragments of sandy colored, granular material were uncovered during the
reconstruction of Barracks 2 and were identified as building mortar (Kathleen S. Roland:
Personal knowledge). Mortar for Fort Concho's limestone buildings usually consisted of three
parts sand and one part lime with a binder of horsehair and crushed Concho River mussel shell
(Stephen Schmidt: Personal communication 1979).

DOMESTIC ARTIFACTS

The domestic artifacts category was used for cultural material relating to consumer or household
goods. These included glass and ceramic bottles, jars, vessels, ceramic tableware and serving
items, a teaspoon and several tin can fragments. There were a total of 1,289 domestic artifacts
and/or fragments (32.4 percent of all artifacts), weighing a total of 4,873.35 grams (31.31
percent of all weight) found in this excavation (Table 4-1 ).
The Ceramic Assemblage at Fort Concho's Barracks 2
by Jim Hughey
Excavation at Fort Concho's Barracks 2 yielded a total of sixty ceramic artifacts and one
complete ginger beer bottle (1.53 percent of all artifacts), weighing a total of 983.2 grams (6.32
percent of all artifact weight). Sherds and non-ceramic artifacts (representing non-vessel items
such as a portion of a porcelain doorknob, one ceramic button, various toy remnants and
fragments of a modem clay flower pot) were analyzed separately. The remaining forty-three
sherds represent a small ceramic assemblage, the bulk of which consists of stoneware (including
white ironstone) and porcelain. A small number of sherds were too fragmentary to make
positive identification possible; these were categorized as "refined white earthenware" for
reasons outlined below.
The statistical software package SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) was used in
the analysis of this data.
Distribution of Ceramic Artifacts
The excavated ceramics were concentrated mainly in the area between footings F8 and F26
(Figure 3-5) along the south portion of Barracks 2. Most of this assemblage was recovered from
footings FS, F16, F18, F20, F21 and F24, and suggests a highly patterned distribution within
footings F8 through F26. Footing F21 had one of the highest ceramic counts.
An analysis of type as it relates to footing location suggests that the ironstone sherds were
clustered within footings F16 through F21, with an additional peak at footing F24. Porcelain
follows a somewhat similar cluster, although with significantly lower numbers. Stoneware
peaks at FS (n=5); however, upon analysis, these sherds actually represent one bottle (Figure
4-11 ). Two porcelain sherds and one ironstone sherd were recovered by means of mechanical
scraping from the western and southern sides, respectively, of Barracks 2; all were recovered
from the top four to six inches of soil. Footings Fl through FS on the western side were
excavated down to sixteen inches. Footing F6 on the southwest comer and F7 through F32 on
the south were also excavated, but no additional ceramic artifacts were recovered.

Ceramic Vessels
A minimum number index study (MNI) produced an estimated count of twenty-one vessels
(Table 4-11 ), not including one complete ginger beer bottle recovered from footing F22. The
MNI count was produced by taking into account vessel form, rim diameter, ceramic type,
decorative traits and, in some cases, proximity. Undecorated indeterminate body sherds, which
made up 26.7 percent of the total assemblage (n=12), were excluded from this count. This
estimate should be considered as highly conservative.
Of the forty-four sherds analyzed, 60.0 percent (n=27) were classified as white ironstone. The
next highest percentage was of porcelain at 17.0 percent (n=8), followed by refined white
earthenware (n=2). Seven stoneware sherds are covered by this analysis; however, one sherd is
actually the ginger beer bottle previously noted, five form the lip and neck portion of a second
beer bottle and one is possibly from a utility vessel.
Sherd types uncovered from Fort Concho Barracks 2 include fourteen rim sherds, twenty-two
body sherds and eight basal sherds. When combined with attributes such as rim diameter,
curvature and decorative placement, vessel form percentages suggest an assemblage that is comprised of mostly plate sherds, but also includes saucers, cups, serving bowls, bottles, utilityware

*Fragments too small to positively identify by type

and possibly a pitcher. Forty percent of the sherds were too small to identify by vessel type;
these were classified as "indeterminate." A cross-tabulation of vessel form as related to type
suggests that the ceramic assemblage recovered contained a number of white ironstone vessels,
including cups, saucers, plates, bowls, serving bowls and a pitcher. Porcelain sherds represent
one cup, one saucer, a serving bowl, one plate and a restricted-neck bottle of unknown use
(Figure 4-12 and Table 4-12).
Box plots of rim diameter as related to both vessel and ceramic type are included in this
presentation despite the extremely small sample size (Figure 4-13). While most vessels and
types are represented by only one or two rim sherds, it can be noted that the porcelain rim
sherds (n=4) display the widest range in terms ofrim diameter with a minimum of 2 cm and a
maximum of 24 cm. The highest rim sherd count was of ironstone sherds (n=6) with a
minimum rim diameter of 8 cm and a maximum of 18 cm.
Discussion
Many of the sherds in this assemblage were highly fragmented, making identification of some
of the smaller sherds difficult or impossible. Two were identified as refined white earthenware

for two reasons: first, both appeared to be too coarsely grained to be designated as ironstone
and, second, the transitional nature of many of the late 19th century white earthenwares
identified by researchers as "whiteware," "pearlware" or, to a lesser extent, "ironstone," make
positive identification troublesome under the best of circumstances.
Since late 18th century ware nomenclature ("whiteware," "pearlware" and varieties of
stoneware, among others) cannot be applied to 19th century ceramics, researchers of the latter
are faced with a problem. As noted by Miller, mid-to-late 18th century technological, economic
and political changes relating to the English ceramic industry significantly enhanced that country's influence on the world's ceramic trade. This revolution, exemplified by the role played by
creamware and its successor wares (pearl ware and whiteware), would lead to the eventual abandonment of classification by ware types in favor of an economic scaling system that, in many
cases, emphasized decorative technique and style over paste composition (Miller 1980: 1-39).
The matter of classification is further complicated by changes in consumer taste and the
perceived fluctuations of marketability by manufacturers during the mid-19th century as the
amount of "blueing" (determined by the amount of cobalt added to the ceramic paste) was first
decreased and then briefly increased around 1840 to satisfy consumer demand.
55

Nomenclature variations also occurred in the use of the term "pearl" on makers' marks (e.g.,
"Pearl Stone," "Pearl White" and "Pearl Ironstone China"). These variations suggest that
classifications used today by researchers are focusing on distinctions that were not important in
the 19th century ceramic industry.
As an example, pearlware was developed from creamware in the 1780's and, in time, replaced it
in popularity. Characteristics of early pearlwares include a distinctive blue hue to the surface of
the vessel which is especially noticeable around the handles, curves and other areas where the
glaze had an opportunity to pool. This blueing was gradually reduced over time until, by the
1820's, the ceramic type termed by archeologists as whiteware began to appear. Common
diagnostic traits of whitewares include a generally whiter tone to the paste, a tendency for
potters to employ underglaze transfer printing for decoration and a noticeable reduction of wear
and crazing on the surface glaze. As stated by Miller, researchers classifying early 19th century
ceramics are likely to come across sherds that are "obviously pearlware .. , (those that are)
obviously whiteware ... and a third group that is between the two" (Miller 1980).
The best course, then, to take when dealing with a small, highly fragmented assemblage such as
the Fort Concho collection is to utilize a methodology that will restrict the likelihood of
identification error. These factors suggest that utilization of a ware-type classification scheme
should be done with caution when dealing with 19th century sites. Researchers working with
white ironstone sherds face a similar problem, although, in these cases, the variation comes
from within the ceramic type as opposed to among differing types.
Ironstone is a dense, mostly vitrified ware with a paste that is harder than earthenware but softer
than porcelain. White ironstone exhibits a graying tint in the paste and on the surface glaze that,
along with an increased vitrification of the paste, helps to distinguish it from other undecorated
white ceramics. Although originally developed by English potters in an attempt to compete
with Chinese porcelain, by the mid-19th century, a thicker, heavier, less vitrified and less
expensive type emerged, usually in the form of utility vessels which lacked the detailed patterns
found on earlier versions (Miller 1991). As a result, distinguishing between the earlier and later
versions of undecorated and sometime decorated ironstone sherds often depends on the
comparison between the relative thicknesses of the sherds and the degree of vitrification. These
comparisons can be made with little difficulty when dealing with large samples, but the small,
highly fragmented assemblages such as those found at Fort Concho tend to make these temporal
comparisons problematical.

Analysis and Results
Overall, this assemblage seems to be comprised of a miscellaneous collection of tableware as
there appear to be very few or no matching set components. In addition, a wide range of decorative techniques and styles was represented. Almost 60.0 percent of the collection exhibited
some type of decoration with techniques that included hand-painted (both under glaze and over
glaze), a small molded flower design, and transferware and "flow blue" transferware (Figure
4-14).
56

This diversity is counter to what would be expected from a military post normally purchasing
tableware in bulk, which was the case at Fort Concho during the army's occupation of the site.
Each enlisted man was issued a fork, knife, tin plate and tin cup. Certain vessels relating to
high-volume food preparation, such as large cooking pots, were available from the quartermaster's inventory. Tableware items for use in the mess hall by the regiment, however, were
purchased as sets with money made from the sale of excess food rations (Various Fort Concho
personnel: Personal communication 1999).
This brings up some interesting problems. One would not expect to recover a large ceramic
assemblage from the area in front of the barracks and, of those ceramics that were recovered,
the decorative variation, if any, should be minimal.

Why, then, is there so much variation in this ceramic collection? Also, how does one explain
the presence of porcelain items not normally associated with enlisted personnel, such as toy
fragments (parts of dolls and toy tea sets) and sherds from a tea set? Further, the interesting
distribution pattern previously covered in this analysis should be considered. Few of the
decorative patterns on these sherds provided much help in assigning a temporal range to the site,
and the meager sample size precluded any attempt to produce a mean ceramic date for the site
(South 1977). In general terms, however, an examination of the decorative techniques as they
relate to certain individual Fort Concho sherds is somewhat instructive, as outlined in the
following discussion of various artifacts.
57

Artifact B2-F22-5 - Decorative Traits
The only complete ceramic vessel recovered during the excavation of Barracks 2 is a stoneware
bottle (Figure 4-15). Based on form, this bottle is most likely a ginger beer bottle common
during the time of the barrack's military occupation. It measures 8-1/2 inches (21.6 cm) tall
with a rim diameter of 3 cm and has a flat base, straight sides and weak shoulders with a slightly
incurving neck. Stoneware bottles were produced over the years with a number of slips and
glazes. This specimen was covered with a common brown slip. This coloration was most
likely created by the addition of a small amount of manganese to the liquid clay (Watkins 1968).
Other methods of slipping and glazing stoneware objects that were common to the fort period
include the use of a particular clay to form an Albany slip which makes use of the clay's ability
to fuse a natural coating when fired and the addition of salt to the kiln during the firing process,
producing the characteristic "orange peel" texture of the ceramic. This vessel has neither the
texture of salt-glazed ceramics or the characteristic dark color of Albany-slipped vessels. The
brown-slipped colorization and texture are similar to many ordinary stoneware bottles of the
time.
Sherd B2-F21-35 - Decorative Traits
This artifact has been identified as stippled blue transferware of either a stem and leaf or vine
pattern printed on both sides. It appears to be an ironstone body sherd of an indeterminate
vessel (Figure 4-16).
Historically, the first use of stippled printing appears in the early 1800's (Coyish and Henrywood 1982) and remained in use until approximately 1820. During the first part of the 19th
century, these vessels were decorated with geometric borders in cobalt blue. Floral borders
were common during the 1840's (Mcintosh 1982, Price 1981 ). Printed transferware temporarily
declined in popularity in the 1850's as the demand for ironstone increased (Miller 1991); this
decline lasted until around 1870 when the call for printed wares again increased (Warburton
1931).
This sherd appears to pre-date the military occupation of the site and may, therefore, represent
an heirloom vessel.

Sherds B2-F20-29 A and B - Decorative Traits
One rim sherd and one body sherd of white ironstone with a simple molded flower and leaf
motif suggest a pitcher or similar serving vessel (Figure 4-16). Ironstone evolved from stone
china and was being imported from England by the 1840's; it is considered the dominant
material in use from 1850 until the end of the century (Miller 1991).
Sherds B2-F16-18 A, Band C- Decorative Traits
One base sherd and two body sherds of white ironstone plate are decorated on the interior with a
blue hand-painted flower and vine motif (Figure 4-16).
Blue painted floral motifs were popular on teawares as early as the 1820's and on plates in a
wider range of colors in the 1830's and 1840's (Miller 1991). These sherds are very small (5.6

~--'Figure 4-15. Complete Stoneware Ginger Beer Bottle (B2-F22-5)
grams weight for all three sherds) and show only a portion of the design, but they appear to
pre-date the site's Army occupation, indicating the possibility of an heirloom vessel.

Sherds B2-F21-3 7 A and B - Decorative Traits
One base sherd and one rim sherd of a white ironstone saucer are decorated with flow blue
transferware flowers (Figure 4-16).
"Flow blue" is a transfer technique that utilized the introduction of chlorine gas into the kiln
during the firing process to blur the blue into the white material of the ironstone. The process
was developed early the 19th century and was popular from the 1840's to the 1870's (Mcintosh
1982). The demand for flow blue ware declined somewhat during the 1850's due to the
importation of white ironstone into the United States (Warburton 1931 ). The design motif and
range of colors on these sherds suggest that the saucer may date to the later end of this range
(1870's), which would be the Fort Concho period.

Sherd B2-F8-10 - Decorative Traits
A highly fragmented ironstone (?) sherd from an indeterminate body was decorated with a handpainted overglaze of a rose and leaf motif in a red, green and black color scheme (Figure 4-16).
After the 1830's, hand-painted designs in black, reds, and light greens and blues were used for
tea sets and plates; from the 1840's to the 1870's, flow-painted wares in blues and purples were
popular (Miller 1991). While this sherd appears to pre-date the site's military occupation, the
high degree of fragmentation makes identification very difficult.

60

Sherd B2-F12-26 - Decorative Traits
An ironstone base sherd of an indeterminate vessel has a portion of a maker's mark (Figure
4-16).

The Henry Alcock Pottery of Colbridge, Staffordshire, England, was in operation from 1861
through 1910 (Kovel 1953). Only a portion of the mark is visible on the sherd, but it is similar
to the mark used by the Alcock factory between 1880 and 1910 in terms ofletter style and
arrangement with minor variations (Figure 4-17). If the mark on the sherd does indeed reflect
a change over time of the manufacturer's mark, the sherd itself should be dated to the time of
or immediately following the military occupation of Fort Concho.
Non-Vessel Ceramics
Non-vessel ceramic artifacts uncovered during the Barracks 2 reconstruction include one-half
of a porcelain doorknob (B2-F14-20) of the same type used at the fort, one ceramic marble
(B2-F20-15), a portion of a molded porcelain doll face (B2-F24-29) and two unidentifiable
porcelain fragments that have been tentatively labeled as toy portions. The first toy portion is
a brown underglazed fragment that could be part of a doll (B2-F21-59) and the second is a
curved fragment somewhat representative of a toy tea pot (B2-F21-12). Eight sherds from a
modem terracotta flower pot (B2-F20-1) were discovered near footing F20.
All non-vessel ceramics discovered most likely came with the civilian occupation that postdated the military occupation of the fort.

Conclusion
In terms of decorative traits, the ceramic assemblage from the barracks appears to be at odds
with what would be expected at a military fort, especially one post-dating the Civil War. This
obvious contradiction can be explained by taking into account both the layout of the fort during
its use by the military and by the site's subsequent occupational history after it was abandoned
by the U.S. Army in 1889.
While the fort was in use by the military, the complex of buildings near Barracks 2 included the
Officers' Quarters located south across the Parade Ground parallel to the barracks, and the Mess
Hall which ran perpendicular to the barracks to the north. To the east of Barracks 2 was
Barracks 3, which was converted to a hotel in 1889.
Barracks 2 was leased by civilians and used for various businesses, including the Higginbotham
Brothers and Company lumber business and the Monarch Tile Company. Refer to Chapter 2 for
a detailed discussion of the history of the fort and, specifically, of Barracks 2.
The fragmentary nature of the sherds recovered near the limestone footings of the south porch is
suggestive of periods of general clean-up of the area. This may also explain the apparently
random distribution of ceramics at the site.
It is more likely, however, that the bulk of the ceramic assemblage can be attributed to the later
domestic occupation that took place near Barracks 2 following the military use. This may
account for the several obvious inconsistencies, including the presence of parts oftoys, the
porcelain tea set sherds, the range of decorative styles and the seemingly later dates for some of
these sherds. The civilian occupation also helps to explain the presence of parts of toys, the
porcelain tea set sherds, the range of decorative styles and the seemingly later dates for some of
these sherds. The civilian occupation also helps to explain the presence of the decorative styles
and techniques which peaked in popularity after the fort's use by the military.
In conclusion, it appears that the Fort Concho assemblage reflects two occupations: the military
and the civilian. The bulk of the assemblage is undecorated and highly fragmented white ironstone, some of which may be associated with the military occupation of the site. The
remainder of the assemblage is made up of relatively larger, decorated sherds of white ironstone, a small amount of white earthenware, porcelain and toy fragments which may, based on
decorative style and technique, relate to the later civilian occupation. Although the small sample size may have biased this analysis, it suggests that the post-1889 civilian occupation is better
represented in this ceramic assemblage than the enlisted men who were assigned to Barracks 2.
Glass Assemblage
No intact glass bottles were found in this excavation. Because of the high degree of fragmentation, in most cases only a probable function can be assigned to any of the glass fragments found.
A total of 1, 141 items of domestic bottle, jar and bowl/vase glass was found with a total weight
of 3,258.35 grams. The footing with the highest percentage of domestic glass by weight was
62

F18 with 17.24 percent. The second highest percentage was F20 with 15.04 percent. The third
highest percentage by weight was F21 with 8.65 percent (Table 4-13). The south grade (SG),
the trench on the east (T) and the west grade (WG) must be disregarded as they cover a
disproportionately large amount of screened soil.
A total of 1,927 fragments of glass (48.44 percent of all artifacts), weighing a total of 4,730.85
grams (30.39 percent of all artifact weight), were found in Barracks 2. Refer to Table 4-2 and to
the activities artifacts and construction artifacts sections of this chapter for more information on
glass fragments and objects recovered during the reconstruction of Barracks 2. Table 4-14 is a
tabulated breakdown of all glass recovered by type.
Glass Bottles and Jars
A total of 1, 167 fragments of bottle glass (29 .34 percent of all artifacts) was excavated from
Barracks 2, totaling 3,398.5 grams of weight (21.83 percent of all artifacts). This total includes
seventy-eight jar fragments (1.96 percent of all artifacts), totaling 500.3 grams of weight (3 .21
percent of all artifact weight). Refer to Tables 4-14 and 4-15.
Much of this glass now has a permanent coating of silica/sand which often produces iridescent
reflections of light. When glass is buried in soil as mineral-rich as the area surrounding Fort
Concho, lime and other deposits leach from the soil and into the glass which then forms the
"skin." Ground water in the San Angelo area contains large deposits of lime and other minerals
that result in heavy deposits of this silica "skin" on glass buried for any length of time (Beck
1974:19). Table 4-15 shows the statistical breakdown of bottle glass objects and fragments by
color.
No complete glass bottles, or any other glass objects, were found in this excavation. Since
many of the bases were so fragmentary, it is virtually impossible to determine with any
accuracy, how many bottles are represented in the assemblage. It is possible that there are few
as twenty-three or as many as thirty-eight bottles, jars, bowls and/or vases present.
Glass Bottle Bases by Shape
A total of thirty-eight bases and/or fragments of bases were found. Of these thirty-eight, two
fragments were too small to type by shape. There were twenty-eight round bases, three straightsided bases (not large enough to determine the type(s) of straight-sided base(s)), two possible
beveled ideal bases, one plain oval base and one irregular polygon base (Fike 1987: 10). No
square bases were found. Refer to Table 4-16 for a statistical analysis and Figure 4-18 for
profiles of the bases that were excavated.

Glass Bottle Basemarks
Of the thirty-eight glass bottle or jar bases recovered, only thirteen have basemarks, and, of the
thirteen, only five are identifiable (Table 4-17). None of the glass bottle or jar bases are
conclusively from the fort period. The five identifiable basemarks are as follows:

B2-F18-56

B2-F20-61

B2-F21-38

B2-F24-33

A partial, clear glass base of a fruit jar displays the raised lettering
"15-7 Ball". The "Ball" 'TM' is in a slanting script, missing the
top portion of the "B" and a straight line finial from the last "l".
With the missing lettering, it was not possible to accurately date
the jar. The Ball Brothers Company of Muncie, Indiana, patented
the jar on November 30, 1858, and continues to produce it with
variations to the present (Toulouse 1969:27-41).
The letters "MG [BACKWARDS 'B'] 8 BUNION MADE GA"
indicate that the manufacturer was the Maywood Glass Company
of Compton, California, which was in operation from 1930 to
1961. This mark with the "MG" slanted to the left was dated ca.
1958 (Toulouse 1971 :357).
This clear glass bottle is from the Knox Glass Bottle Company of
Jackson, Mississippi, which produced glass from 1932 to 1953
(Cheek 1977:30).
A fragment of a cobalt blue VICKS 'TM' medicine bottle with
"Vick... " and "TRO" in raised lettering. The intact bottle would
have had an embossed triangle labeled "Vicks VA-TRO-NOL. For

B2-SG-3

(This fragment is also described in this report under the heading "Glass
Patent Medicine Bottles.")
A clear bottle base with raised lettering of a partial "F" inside a
partial keystone. Outside the keystone is the designation
"T-384-5". The bottle is probably from the C.L. Flaccus Glass
Company, Pennsylvania, post-1900 (Toulouse 1971: 190).

Glass Bottles and Jars With Lettering
Thirteen bottle parts have recognizable raised lettering in various locations other than the base.
B2-F18-28 is a parallel-sided clear glass medicine bottle side with the lettering "1 1/2 FL.
OZ 5" (Table 4-18).
Bottle fragments B2-F20-67 and B2-F21-47 have embossed lettering from the Coca Cola
Company. Coca Cola 'TM' began using embossed lettering on its bottles on November 16, 1915,
and continued their use until the early 1960's when the embossing was replaced with white
lettering. The body style of these bottle fragments is designated as the "hobble skirt" or "Mae
West" (Glynn Strom: Personal communication 1999). The fragments are not from the fort
period.
Glass Bottle and Jar Neck Finishes
Twenty-three fragmented neck finishes were found in this excavation. A neck finish is defined
as the addition of a collar or band of glass to the neck of a bottle at or near the lip of the orifice
or the manipulation of the bottle during the manufacturing process to produce a finished effect
( Herskovitz 1977:3). The names and shapes of finish styles were derived from Richard E.

Indeterminate Finish
There were eight glass bottle necks so highly fragmented that they could not be assigned to a
neck-finish type.
Glass Jar Lids
Two partial jar lids were found in this excavation:

B2-F18-23
B2-F24-20

Two fragments of thick, purple glass jar lid; one small piece with a
partial oval lip and the other with a straight lip, not threaded
Two fragments of clear glass jar lid, not threaded.

Glass Bottles and Containers with Designs and/or Patterns
Pressed Glass
Seventy-four recovered fragments of glass, weighing a total 219.3 grams, had been moldpressed with various designs. The designs included florals, bows, dots, ridges, curves, flutes,
triangles, bubbles, stars, ripples, ribs, diagonal lines, lozenges and squares. The vast majority of
the machine-pressed glass was made of clear glass. Weighing 51.2 grams with a diameter of
approximately 5.5 cm, B2-Fll-3 is a round, clear glass base with a partial stem, possibly from a
goblet or footed vase (Figure 4-20). There are no markings on the base.

Figure 4-19. Bottle Finishes
Pressed glass is created when glass is blown into a mold, simulating cut glass; it was first
manufactured in the 1820's (Spillman 1982:12). It is, therefore, possible that fragments of the
glass could be from the fort period, but, with no markings and with the high degree of
fragmentation, dating is impossible with any degree of certainty.

Cut Glass
No cut glass objects were identified in this excavation. The term "cut glass" describes an item
which has been decorated by cutting the surface after the piece had been formed either by
pressing or free-blowing (Herskovitz 1978:26).

72

Since the bottle glass that was found was so fragmented, it could not be determined with any
accuracy how many beverage bottles were represented by the assemblage. A total of 675
fragments, weighing a total of 1,581.7 grams (46.5 percent of all domestic glass) were of clear
bottle glass most probably from either alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage bottles.
Non-Alcoholic Beverage Bottles
A total of 108 fragments, weighing 261.4 grams (7. 7 percent of all domestic glass) are of aqua
bottle glass, excluding ink bottle fragments. Fifty fragments, weighing 130.5 grams, are of
light- to medium-green bottle glass. Both the aqua and green glass fragments were probably
from non-alcoholic beverage bottles, soda or mineral water. Without markings, there is no way
to determine if any are from the fort period.
Alcoholic Beverage Bottles
The drinking of alcoholic beverages was prevalent on frontier military posts during the Indian
Wars period, as proven on various excavations at Fort Concho and other posts of the era
(Kathleen S. Roland: Personal knowledge). Alcoholic beverages were available in several
types of bottles, such as brown or amber for beer, clear for whiskey and dark olive green for
wine and champagne. Since no complete alcoholic beverage bottles were found, it is virtually
impossible to determine with any accuracy how many alcoholic beverage bottles are represented
in the glass assemblage. It is possible, at best educated guess, that there are at least six
alcoholic beverage bottles present: four brown beer bottles, one clear whiskey bottle and at
least one dark olive green wine or champagne bottle.
Beer and Whiskey Bottles - A total of 189 fragments weighing 977.8 grams (28.8 percent of all
domestic glass) were of brown beer or whiskey bottle glass. No labels were found on these
fragments. A maker's mark was identified on artifact B2-F20-61(Figure4-21). Refer to the
section titled "Glass Bottle Basemarks" in this chapter for further details. Amber or brown glass
was widely used after 1860 for alcoholic beverages such as beer and whiskey (Fike 1987: 13 ), as
well as for medicine bottles. Only two intact beer or whiskey bottle necks were found in this
excavation, both with wine- or brandy-type neck finishes: B2-F23-9 and B2-F23-10. Fragment
B2-F21-45, with its plain oval base, may be from a clear glass whiskey flask.
Olive-Green Colored Bottles - A total of eighty-seven fragments weighing 277.8 g~ams (8.2
percent of all domestic glass) were of dark olive green. These fragments could have been from
wine, champagne or mineral water bottles. None of these fragments were bases and the one
neck fragment was too small to type. In use prior to 1870 and often called "black glass," these
bottles were used mostly for alcoholic beverages including stout, ale and wine, and for mineral
water (Fike 1978:13). Again, the high degree of fragmentation and lack of markings make it
impossible to date the fragments.
Non-Glass Beverage Bottles
The only intact bottle found in the excavation is B2-F22-5. This stoneware bottle, either for ale
or ginger beer (Cheek 1977: 117), is a complete vertical-walled bottle with a common brown
slip (Figure 4-15). See the "Ceramics Artifacts" section in this chapter for a further description.

Glass Condiment Bottles
Three possible condiment bottle fragments were identified. Both B2-F14-33 and B2-F15-3 are
fragments of clear bottle glass with five fluted sides typical of condiment serving bottles called
vinaigrettes.
B2-F18-12 is a round, clear glass condiment bottle neck with a small hole in the center. The
neck finish is broken, making it impossible to identify the type of neck finish; most likely, the
bottle had a small round neck. Again, the high degree of fragmentation and lack of markings
make it impossible to date the fragments.
74

Glass Patent Medicine Bottles
B2-F24-33 (Figure 4-20) is a fragment of a cobalt blue VICKS 'TM' medicine bottle with "Vick.
.. "and "TRO" in raised lettering. The original intact bottle would have had an embossed
triangle labeled "Vicks VA-TRO-NOL. For Nose & Throat, Vicks Chemical Co., Greensboro,
N.C." "Va-Tro-Nol" was introduced with Vicks Medicated Cough Drops 'TM' in 1931, a
product of the Vicks Chemical Company (Fike 1978:184). This fragment is also described in
this chapter under the heading "Glass Bottle Basemarks."

Six other possible medicine bottle pieces were found for a total of seventeen glass medicine
bottle fragments, weighing 91.7 grams. One piece is a fragment of amber-colored glass bottle,
two pieces are of brown bottle glass with squared sides and one piece (B2-F18-28) is a clear
glass side with the lettering "1 1/2 FL. OZ. 5... "on a partial base. Several other clear glass
partial bases with squared sides were uncovered, none with maker's marks. B2-F20-25 is a
short white milkglass round base which could have been from either a salve jar or a cold cream
jar.
There is no way to identify these medicine bottles as being from the fort period.

A fragment of a ruby(?) red pressed glass rim with a round lip,
smooth on one side (the inside of the curve) with a raised pressed

One fragment of white milkglass bowl rim with a partial design of
ridges at the fragmented edge
A fragment of clear glass vase(?) with a scalloped rounded lip and
mold-pressed dimpled and floral designs on one side.

There is no way to identify these vase or bowl fragments as being from the fort period.
Lamp Chimney Glass
Thirty-six thin, clear glass kerosene lamp chimney fragments, weighing a total of 10.2 grams,
were excavated from Barracks 2. These pieces are too fragmented to be positively identified as
coming from the "student-type" kerosene lamps issued by the U.S. Army in 1882 (Herskovitz
1978:30). B2-F21-46 is a fragment of a round, opaque, red and white piece of glass which
could be a lamp finial from the fort period.

Domestic Metal Assemblage
A total of fifty domestic metal artifacts and/or fragments (1.26 percent of all artifacts found),
weighing a total of 666.8 grams (4.28 percent of all weight), was recovered from Barracks 2.
Bottle Caps
Six crown-type, crimped metal bottle caps were recovered from Barracks 2. These are from the
post-fort period.
Furniture/Stove Parts
Five fragments of furniture hardware were found, as follows:

decoration or from a decorative box, possibly from the fort period
(Figure 4-23). (Also listed as a possible personal artifact under
"Personal Miscellaneous Artifacts" section.)
Oval brass escutcheon plate with attachment holes on either end,
possibly furniture decoration; possibly from the fort period (Figure
4-23). (Also listed as a possible personal artifact under "Personal
Miscellaneous Artifacts" section.)

Lamp Parts
One fragment of a brass wick holder from a kerosene lamp (B2-F21-15) was excavated from the
Barracks; this fragment is likely from the fort period.
Tableware
B2-T-42 is a silver-plated teaspoon with the maker's mark "PIXAGORN BRAND" on the back
of the handle (Figure 4-23). A reference search revealed no reference to this mark. No other
information was found to aid in the dating of this teaspoon.
Tin Cans
Thirty-seven tin can fragments, weighing 180.4 grams, were found. Of these, three are tin can
lids. All were in such poor condition that they cannot be identified by type or by date.

FAUNAL REMAINS
A total of 103 faunal remains (2.59 percent of all artifacts found), weighing a total of 155.65
grams (1.00 percent of all weight), was recovered from this excavation (Tables 4-1 and 4-19).
The faunal material was identified by Mr. W.L. McClure of Houston, Texas. Mr. McClure
identified thirty-five vertebrate faunal remains, weighing 115.21 grams, that were recovered
during the project. Sixty-eight unidentified bone fragments were found, weighing 34.04 grams.
Most of the faunal remains were highly fragmented.
Mr. McClure identified twenty-six cow bones (including one fragment of cow tooth enamel),
seven bones from large mammals, one chicken bone and one bone from a medium-sized
mammal. Twenty-three bones show butcher marks and/or handsaw cuts. Mr. McClure
concluded that there was a remote possibility that bones tentatively identified as cow bones may
indeed be bison (buffalo) bones. The bones from the large mammals could be deer, goat, pig,
sheep or pronghorn antelope. The bones from medium-size mammals could be from small or
young large mammals or from dog-sized mammals. He concluded that a large number of bones
were probably from cattle that had been slaughtered for food.

PERSONAL ARTIFACTS
Personal artifacts have been categorized into clothing (including buttons and military insignia),
coins, personal-care items, jewelry and miscellaneous. There were a total of thirty-nine
personal artifacts ( 0. 9 8 percent of all artifacts) for a total weight of 15 6 .10 grams ( 1. 00 percent
of all artifact weight) found in the Barracks 2 excavation (Table 4-1 ).
Clothing

The only identifiable items of clothing recovered were buttons and military insignia.
Buttons
Twelve buttons of the following materials were recovered: two brass, four steel, one bone, two
wooden, one pearl shell, one ceramic and one plastic.
Military Brass Buttons
The U.S. Army buttons most often found in the past twenty years at Fort Concho have been
either "line" or "general-service" three-piece brass eagle buttons consisting of a convex cover, a
backing and a loop shank (Kathleen S. Roland: Personal knowledge). The brass cover displays
an eagle facing right with outspread wings, holding an olive branch in the left claw and arrows
in the right and with a recessed shield in the center of its chest.
The "line" eagle button was adopted in 1833 and used through the Civil War for enlisted men's
uniforms and until 1902 for officers'. After 1840, the button had a recessed shield with a raised
letter indicating the wearer's branch of service: "I" for Infantry, "C" for Cavalry, "A" for
Artillery, "R" for Mounted Rifles, "D" for Dragoons and "V" for Voltigeurs (a designation of
service from 1847 to 1849). The manufacturer's name was often stamped on the flat back
surface.
The "general-service" eagle button was used by the U.S. Army from 1855 until 1902 for enlisted
men's uniforms. The button cover displays a simplified eagle with a recessed, wide, flat and
lined shield on its breast; the stylized wings are long and narrow. The design was modified
slightly in 1884 to show an eagle with short, wide wings and a long neck on a small raised
shield. Both buttons were manufactured in two sizes: coat button diameters measured 20 or 21
mm and the cuff/vest/jacket button, 14 to 16 mm. These sizes also varied greatly from
manufacturer to manufacturer (Brinckerhoff 1976:2-5, Cheek 1977:54). Refer to Brinckm-hoff
for more detailed information on military buttons.
Only two brass military eagle buttons were recovered from the Barracks 2 site: both are cuff or
vest buttons, one a line eagle and one a general-service eagle (Figure 4-24).

Left to right: brass Infantry line eagle cuff button with headstamp (B2-F20-10) and brass
general-service eagle cuff button with headstamp (B2-T-1)
Figure 4-24. Brass Buttons

Line Eagle Button
B2-F20-10 is a small line-eagle cuff/vest button with the letter "I" (Infantry) inside a raised
shield. The shank is missing and the button is headstamped "D. EVANS & CO. SUPERFINE".
With the headstamp data, it can be determined that the button is of a post-Civil War style that
was manufactured in the 1860's and 1870's (McGuinn 1983:36). It can be speculated that an
infantry button was found in a cavalry barracks by means of either of the following hypotheses:
•

Official post returns for companies that served at Fort Concho indicate that, at times, more
infantry soldiers were billeted than could be housed in existing infantry barracks (Post...
Returns, Fort Concho, Texas, December 1867 to June 1889). Infantry troops could have
been housed temporarily during these postings in the cavalry barracks.

•

The button could also have been lost by an infantry soldier working on a construction detail
to build or repair Barracks 2.

It must be noted, however, that both of the previous possibilities are merely speculation.
81

A third more obvious possibility also exists that an infantry soldier or officer was merely
walking past or visiting the cavalry barracks when he lost the button.
General-Service Eagle Button
The second brass button (B2-T-l) is a small (15-mm diameter) general-service eagle cuff/vest
button with a raised shield and intact shank, with the headstamp "SCOVILLS & CO. EXTRA".
This button was manufactured between 1840 and 1850 (McGuinn 1983:90-91).
Metal Buttons (Non-Brass)
Four rusted steel buttons were recovered (Figure 4-25):

Because of the high degree of corrosion, it could not be determined if these buttons were the
military "white metal" fly or suspender buttons referred to by Cheek (Cheek 1977:56). Therefore, there is no way to definitely assign these buttons to the fort period, even though it is likely
that they were from articles of men's clothing.
Bone Buttons
One bone, cream-colored, two-hole button with a diameter of 13 mm was found (Figure 4-25).
B2-F20-14 is probably a shirt button, but, with no identifying marks, it is not possible to
determine its origin for dating purposes.
Wooden Buttons
Two wooden buttons were found (Figure 4-25):

B2-F21-18
B2-F20-9

A four-hole, curved-top wooden button with a diameter of 14 mm
that was burned black; the black rubs off
A brown, two-hole wooden button with a diameter of 19 mm and a
raised top and circle at its edge and around the hole area.

With no identifying marks, no dating of the buttons is possible.
Shell Buttons
One pearl shell button was recovered (Figure 4-25): B2-F20-50 is a two-hole pearl shirt button
with a diameter of 15 mm and the hole area broken out between the holes. It is not possible to
date this artifact.
82

Ceramic Buttons
One ceramic button was found (Figure 4-25): B2-F23-2 is a two-hole, 15-mm-diameter shirt
button of off-white unglazed ceramic with large holes. No dating is possible.
Plastic Buttons
One plastic button was recovered (Figure 4-25): B2-F12-27 is a four-hole, 13-mm-diameter
off-white plastic button. Obviously, this button is not of the fort period.
Military Insignia
U.S. Army insignia from 1875 to 1897 (including the fort period) were thin, stamped, hollowbacked brass representations (crossed .45/70 rifles for the Infantry and crossed sabers for the
Cavalry) with four soldered loops mounted on the back for attachment to the cloth of the forage

The only item of branch insignia found during the reconstruction of Barracks 2 was B2-F22-3,
a very fragmented (ten pieces), brass Infantry crossed-rifle insignia, dating ca. 1875 to 1897
(Figure 4-26). This insignia is too corroded and fragmented to determine whether it had been
lead filled; it is datable to the fort period.
No cavalry insignia were found.

Coins
There was one coin recovered from the excavation and it is not from the fort period: B2-F20-44
is a 1906, copper, one-penny coin from Great Britain (Figure 4-27). The head of King Edward
appears in the center with "OMN: REX: FID: DEF: IND: IMP EDWARDUS VII: DEL GRA:
BRITT:". The obverse has a figure of Seated Victory in the center, "ONE" to the left,
"PENNY" to the right and "1906" at the bottom.

Personal-Care Artifacts
Two personal-care artifacts were found at Barracks 2: B2-Fll-2 and B2-F20-25.
Perfume Bottle

B2-Fll-2 is a partial, clear-glass perfume bottle with the neck and lip missing. It has an
irregular polygon-shaped base (six-sided with two long parallel sides and two shorter triangular
sides at each end). There is a raised flower design, possibly a rose, with leaves near the top on
both sides (Figure 4-28).
There are no identifying marks to make dating possible.

decoration or from a decorative box, possibly from the fort period
(Figure 4-23). (Also listed as a possible furniture artifact under
"Furniture/Stove Parts" paragraph.)

WORKSHOP ARTIFACTS

Objects in the workshop artifacts category are associated with barn and/or workshop activities,
including workshop tools, products and by-products. There were a total of seventy-one workshop artifacts (1.78 percent of all artifacts) weighing a total of 509.60 grams (3.27 percent of all
artifact weight) found in the excavation of Barracks 2 (Table 4-1 ).
Horse and Mule Gear

No horseshoes or horseshoe nails were found, somewhat of a surprise considering Barracks 2's
proximity to a stable area. A possible explanation of this dichotomy is that any horseshoe nails
had deteriorated over the years into any of the numerous deposits of rust uncovered during the
reconstruction.
Artifact B2-F21-42 is a buckle, probably part of a horse or mule harness or trappings (Cheek
1977:92). This small steel bar buckle measures 7/8 inch by 11/16 inch with a tongue attached
to a raised center bar (Figure 4-31 ).
Automobile Parts and Tools

Several non-fort period items associated with automobiles were found, including a Model-T
wrench (B2-F30-1) (Figure 4-31), dating from ca. 1909 to 1929 (Robert Broene: Personal
communication 1999). Also recovered were a bush rod and five spark plugs.
Tools

The reconstruction of Barracks 2 uncovered an eight-inch section of what appeared to be a
ten-inch metal file, referred to as a "bastard" file (B2-F16-27) (Figure 4-31). This tool was used
for finishing work on metal and could be from the fort period.
Wire

Forty-one fragments of wire weighing 154.2 grams were found. Nine fragments are made of
copper (weighing 37.7 grams) and thirty-two are made of steel (weighing 116.5 grams);
twenty-seven fragments are unidentifiable twisted strands of wire.
Modem Electrical and Telephone Materials
'-

Eight fragments of modem plastic-coated copper electrical wire (weighing 17.5 grams), two
circular steel fragments from electrical outlets (weighing 27.3 grams) and one length of
stainless-steel alloy telephone cable stretcher were found. These materials, of course, are not
from the fort period.

89

Miscellaneous Workshop Materials
Miscellaneous objects found during the reconstruction of Fort Concho's Barracks 2 include the
following items: a carbonized battery, a plastic cap, a piece of graphite, an unidentified
fragment of flat, thin lead, a metal spiral-shaped object, two steel springs, one cotter pin and a
small fragment of thin steel of unknown use. These objects do not appear to be from the fort
period.

Top to bottom: "bastard" metal-workingfile (B2-F16-27), Model-Twrench (B2-F30-1) and

MISCELLANEOUS ARTIFACTS
There were a total of 282 miscellaneous artifacts and/or fragments (7.09 percent of all artifacts)
for a total of 1,291.89 grams of weight (8.30 percent of all artifact weight) found during this
excavation (Table 4-1 ).
An artifact was placed in the miscellaneous category when it could not be assigned with any
degree of certainty to a more specific category. For example, many metal fragments were too
fragmented and/or corroded to be identified. As a further example, any of these fragments or
even localized areas of rust could have been portions oftin cans (making them domestic
artifacts) or nails (making them either construction artifacts or, if a horseshoe or muleshoe,
workshop artifacts).

Mussel Shells
There were forty-nine fragments of fresh water mussel shells recovered from Barracks 2,
weighing a total of 71.39 grams. These shells, most likely harvested from the North, Middle
and South Concho rivers, have been used throughout area history for several purposes:
•

They were, first, a local food source.

•

Second, masons at Fort Concho (and elsewhere in the area) used ground mussel shells as a
binder in the making of mortar for construction and, later, for repair of the limestone
buildings.

•

The shells and their pearls are, even today, valued for their color and texture. It is likely that
soldiers from the fort would have collected the pearls and their shells for jewelry and
possibly crafted decorative items from the shells themselves.

The shells recovered from the reconstruction of the Barracks were too fragmented to assign
them to specific usage categories.

Miscellaneous Metals
Many fragments of rusted iron and/or steel were found during the excavation. A total of 220
fragments of unidentifiable metal ( 12.16 percent of all metal artifacts), weighing a total of
1, 186.60 grams (12.40 percent of all metal artifacts) were noted. These fragments could have
come from rusted metal food containers or from fragments of nails but are not identifiable due
to fragmentation and corrosion.
"

Other Miscellaneous Artifacts
Thirteen other items of the following materials were categorized as miscellaneous artifacts:
Four brass:

a plug with the lettering" ... TE MADE IN USA" from the
1930's or later and three thin fragments, functions unknown

Chapter 5. CONCLUSIONS

ARCHEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE
The exposure of the run of continuous original limestone foundations for the front porch of
Barracks 2 was the most important discovery in this excavation, as well as the location of the
smaller one-foot-square footings on the west end of the porch. The other Fort Concho
buildings, including Barracks 1, 5 and 6, do not show evidence of a continuous run of limestone
footings as shown at Barracks 2. Barracks 3, 4, 5 and 6 were smaller barracks buildings and
probably did not warrant the use of continuous porch footings. Barracks 1, the other cavalry
barracks, probably would have had the same porch construction technique as used in Barracks
2. The area in front of Barracks 1 could have been more disturbed than the area in front of
Barracks 2. It was not surprising, however, that this method of footing construction was used at
Barracks 1 and 2 because they both have the longest expanse of porch. This continuous footing
method would have been used to assist in bearing the weight of such a long expanse of porch.

Interpretation of Site Features
The only previously unknown features identified from the Barracks 2 excavation were the
original footings found intact in the trenches dug for the new porch footing pads on the west
end, the south side continuous footings and those found on the east end. These original footings
were left intact and the concrete poured over them in order to form modem footings for the new
porch construction.

ARTIFACT CONCLUSIONS
Most of the fort period artifacts were fragmented and in poor condition. These items were
deposited there due to poor housekeeping techniques and were probably swept into the cracks of
the wooden porch flooring instead of being carried away to the dump grounds. Therefore, it is
not surprising that very few complete Fort Concho period artifacts were found during this
excavation.

93

Artifact Distributions
All artifacts collected during the Barracks 2 excavation were plotted by number count and
artifact categories according to footings and other areas where excavation was conducted or
artifacts were recovered (nailer, trench or gradings) (Figure 5-1).
Artifacts were also plotted by gram weight of artifact categories according to footings or other
excavated areas. See Figure 5-2 for weight distribution. Weights of artifacts were deemed to be
more important than number count of artifact fragments especially for the construction and
domestic artifact categories.
Presence/Absence Distribution
Figures 5-1 and 5-2 clearly show the presence or absence distribution of artifacts by artifact
category. Activities artifacts (cartridges, marbles and ink bottle, for example) were disbursed in
footings F3, F8, FlO, F12, F16, F18, F20, F21, F22, F24, F26, and in the South Grade, and
the Trench peaking in F18, F24 and the Trench. No activities artifacts were found in footings
FS, F8, FU, F14, F15, F23, F28, F30, F32 and in Nailer, South Grade or West Grade.
Construction artifacts (nails, spikes, screws) were dispersed in footings F3, FS, F8, FlO, and all
footings from F12 through F32 as well as in the Nailer, South Grade, Trench, and West
Grade. Construction artifact numbers peak in footings F20, F21 and F24 and in the Trench.
The only footing which did not have any construction artifacts is FU.
Domestic artifacts (glass bottles, ceramics, flatware) were found in all footings from F3 through
F32 and in all other excavation areas except in Nailer.
Faunal remains (animal bones) were dispersed in footings FlO, Fl2, F16 through F21, F24 and
in the Trench, peaking in footings F20, F21 and F24. Fauna! remains were absent in footings
F3 through F8, FU, F14, F15, F22, F23, and F26 through F32, and in Nailer, South Grade
and West Grade.
Personal artifacts (buttons, hat insignia, coins, etc.) were dispersed in footings F3, FU, F12,
F14, F16, F18, F20, F21, F22, F23, F24, and F26 and in the Trench, peaking in footings F20,
F21, and F22. Personal artifacts were absent in footings FS, F8, FlO, F15, F28, F30, and F32
and in Nailer, South Grade, and West Grade.
Workshop-related artifacts (metal file, wire, etc.) were dispersed in footings F8, FlO, Fl±, F16,
F18, F20, F21, F23, F30 and in the South Grade and Trench, peaking in the Trench and in
footings F18 and F20. Workshop artifacts were absent in footings F3, FS, Fll, F14, F15, F22,
F24, F26, F28, and F32 and in Nailer.
Miscellaneous artifacts were dispersed in footings F3, F8, FlO, F12, F14, F16, F18, F20, F21,

F22, F24, F26, F28 and in the Trench, peaking in footings F18, F20: and F21 and in the
Trench. Miscellaneous artifacts were absent in footings FS, Fll, FlS, F23, F30 and F32 and
in Nailer, South Grade and West Grade.
The majority of artifacts in all of the categories were clustered in footings F18, F20, F21 and
F22 and in the Trench excavation area. This comes as no surprise since footings F18, F20,
F21, and F22 would have been located in the sallyport area where most artifacts would have
been swept out of Barracks 2 during the Fort Concho period. It can only be surmised that this
may have been the same for the post-fort period as well. The Trench excavation area had the
largest amount of soil removed from the site during the excavation - thus, a large amount of
artifacts were recovered.
Weight Plotting
Artifacts were also plotted by gram weight of artifact categories according to footings and other
excavated areas. See Figure 5-2 for the weight distribution chart. Weights of artifacts were
deemed to be more important than number count of artifact fragments especially for the
construction (nails and fragments) and domestic artifact (glass fragments) categories. It was
thought that it would be interesting to see if the weight distribution was different than the
number count distribution especially with the construction and domestic artifact categories.
Activities artifacts by weight peaked at footing F12 with 137.60 grams for seventeen objects
(but second highest in number count), F20 with 106.03 grams for ten objects for second place
(but third highest in number count), and F3 with 5.40 grams for twenty-one objects (third
highest weight but first in number count).
Construction artifacts by weight peaked at footing F20 with 1,630.50 grams for 576 objects
(also highest in number count), the Trench with 1,251.30 grams for 302 objects for second
place (third highest in number count); and F21 with 585.99 grams for 205 objects (third highest
weight but second highest in count).
Domestic artifacts by weight peaked at footing F22 with 693 .1 grams for only one object, the
intact ginger beer bottle (not even ranking in number count), F18 with 649.35 grams for 304
artifacts (second highest in weight but highest in number count), and South Grade with 609.80
grams for only 117 objects (third highest weight but fourth highest in number count).
Faunal remains by weight peaked at footing F24 with 70.2 grams for twenty-eight bones (but
third highest in number count), F20 with 44.05 grams for thirty bones (second highest in \veight
as well as in number count), and F21with25.67 grams for thirty-three bones (third highest in
weight but first in number count).
Personal artifacts by weight peaked at footing Fl 1 with 115 .10 grams for only three objects
(this included the pair of iron scissors) (but tied for third highest in number count), F20 with
57.10 grams for ten objects (second highest in weight but first in count), and F21with6.40
97

grams for only four objects (third highest in weight but second highest in count).
Workshop-related artifacts by weight peaked at the Trench with 111.80 grams for nineteen
objects (also highest in number count), F16 with 104.4 grams for only two objects (including a
metal file) (second highest in weight but not even ranking in number count), and F18 with
75.60 grams for sixteen objects (third highest in weight but second in number count).
Miscellaneous artifacts by weight peaked at footing F18 with 537.15 grams for forty-two
objects (but third highest in number count), F20 with 275.75 grams for sixty-one artifacts
(second highest in weight but first in number count), and F21with244.45 grams for eighty-one
artifacts (third highest in weight but highest in number count).
On the whole, weight distribution corresponded fairly closely with artifact number count
distribution. If there were any changes within a category, the footing or excavation area just
changed positions within the top three highest rankings. Occasionally, one artifact accounted
for a large weight count; for example the intact ginger beer bottle or the metal file weighed
much more than the other artifacts combined.
Artifact Summary

Military Artifacts
There were only five artifacts found at Barracks 2 which can positively be identified as military
objects. These are: two brass military eagle buttons; one infantry line eagle button marked "D.
Evans & Co. Superfine" dated 1860-1870's, and one general service eagle button marked
"Scovills & Co. Extra" dated 1840; fragments of a brass crossed rifle infantry hat insignia dated
1875-1897; and two .45170 rifle cartridges from the Frankfort Arsenal dated February 1886.
The discovery of two infantry artifacts (one infantry button and one infantry hat insignia) poses
an interesting question: did infantrymen ever occupy cavalry barracks, in this case - Barracks
2? Or were these items lost during an infantry work detail? Evidence from research files in the
Fort Concho Library Archives suggests that either one of these answer could be correct. At
times barracks usually designated for infantry or cavalry were used by the other when need
arose. Enlisted men also built and repaired fort buildings as needed (Post Retums:1867-1889).
Another interesting question arises. Why were there no artifacts found in this excavation that
can be specifically attributed to the cavalry since Barracks 2 was a cavalry barracks? Perhaps a
more complete excavation of the entire Barracks 2 area would yield more cavalry artifacts .

.

Barracks 2 was extensively used and renovated after the fort's closure. The grounds were
scraped to build parking areas by the post-fort occupants of the building. This could account for
the lack of fort-period artifacts and the large amount of post-fort artifacts.

98

--------------------------==-~--~----_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _...._ __

Fort-Period Artifacts
Other artifacts that could have been used by the military during the fort period included: five
cartridges and one bullet (one .22 short cartridge with no headstamp, dated 1880's, one .45 Colt
revolver cartridge dated 1873-1912, one .45/70 cartridge with no headstamp dated 1873-1877,
two .50170 cartridges with no headstamps dated 1870-1877, and one .50 caliber Spencer bullet
dated 1860-1873.
Objects used at the Fort Concho buildings included: one partial white porcelain doorknob of
the type used at the fort, many cut nails and spikes, many window glass fragments, fragments of
kerosene lamp chimneys, fragments of glass bottles, and many fragments of white ironstone
china of the type found in other Fort Concho excavations in the past years (Kathleen S. Roland:
Personal knowledge from Mess Hall 3 and Barracks 4 excavations).
Fort-Period Activity Artifacts
Many of the objects found in the Barracks 2 excavation represent the day-to-day life of the Fort
Concho soldier. They include: one iron bar buckle used in horse gear, many lead splatters
(remnants from bullet-making at the Barracks), and an harmonica reed - a common musical
instrument used by soldiers on the frontier.
Non-Fort Period Artifacts
Most of the artifacts found at the Barracks 2 excavation were datable to the post-fort period,
1889 through the present. A large quantity of the datable bottle glass, ceramics, cartridges,
shotgun shells, and other items found date from the one-hundred-plus years of occupation after
the fort was abandoned by the military. Since Barracks 2 was occupied by several businesses
almost immediately after the fort was abandoned, many post-fort period artifacts were found.
These objects include: children's toys; two shotgun shells (one dating from 1894-1943 and one
dating from 1920-1930); a 1906 copper penny from Great Britain; a partial Vicks "VA-TRONOL" 'TM' bottle from 193 l-1960's; modem wire nails, modem Coca Cola 'TM' bottle fragments
and even a modem terra cotta flower pot among other things.
It is not surprising that the vast majority of artifacts found during the reconstruction of Barracks
2 in 1997 are datable to the post-fort period. Barracks 2 was extensively used and renovated
after the fort's closure. The grounds around Barracks 2 have been extensively disturbed by the
post-fort occupants of the building.

Every care was taken to identify, document, catalog, quantify and analyze the artifacts found
even though their impact on Fort Concho was perhaps minimal. No artifacts found were out of
the ordinary in comparison to the previous Fort Concho archeological investigations.
