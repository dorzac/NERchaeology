Abstract
The boundaries and degree of disturbance at site 41EP155/157 located near Horizon City in El
Paso County, Texas were reassessed by archeologists from aci consulting in order to aid Hunt
Communities GP, LLC in the planning of the Mission Ridge mixed use development. Following
testing, Willis and Peterson (2003) concluded that the site was eligible for listing as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) and inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, a
finding that was concurred upon by the Texas Historical Commission (TAC Permits 2923 and
3016) in August 2003. Site 41EP155/157 remains much as described by Willis and Peterson
(2003). While the site includes many deflated and disturbed hearths, less disturbed features
recorded by Willis and Peterson (2003) were relocated and found intact with datable materials.
Two additional areas with intact features and associated artifact scatters were also observed and
recorded. Modern disturbance is confined to the western portion of the site where there is
vehicle access along existing dirt roads. While minor adjustments were made to the site
boundaries, the site remains very close to the same size (approximately 44 acres) and location as
recorded by Willis and Peterson (2003). The newly recorded site boundaries were determined
and mapped by GPS with sub meter accuracy.
Site 41EP155/157 is a SAL eligible archeological resource as determined by Willis and Peterson
(2003) and confirmed through this investigation. Much of the site still remains stable, containing
discrete, intact features with potentially datable materials as well as diagnostic artifacts (pottery).
It is recommended that the site be protected from development and officially designated as a
SAL through the Texas Historical Commission. Should protection of the site not be possible,
mitigation in the form of data recovery is recommended.
Michael Pointkowski served as project archeologist and Ann M. Scott was the Principal
Investigator. Robin Benson Barnes assisted in the preparation of the report. Field work was
conducted in September of 2012. Field records associated with this project will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and site revisit forms for site 41EP155 and 41EP157
will be submitted as well indicating the updated findings from this investigation.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Site 41EP155/157 is located in the proposed Mission Ridge development located near Horizon
City, El Paso County, Texas. The site was previously tested and determined eligible for listing
as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) and inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places (Willis and Peterson 2003), a finding that was concurred upon by the Texas Historical
Commission (TAC Permits 2923 and 3016) in August 2003. Due to the possibility that the site
has been disturbed over the intervening decade and confusion over the exact site boundaries, the
Client, Hunt Communities GP, LLC, has enlisted the services of aci consulting to confirm the
location of the site boundary and reassess the current condition of the site in order to help in the
planning process for the proposed development of Mission Ridge.
The project area is located on the Clint NW 7.5 Minute USGS Quadrangle in El Paso County in
western Texas southeast of the city of El Paso and is bounded on the north by the Highway 62
and on the west by I-10 (Figures 1 and 2). The Client is proposing a mixed use phased
development, which includes single family residences, parks, and open space.
The area of the proposed Mission Ridge development was initially subject to archeological
survey during the 1970s (Lynn et al. 1975), with further work done in the 1980s (DeGarmo
1983), a desktop review in the 1990s (Kauffman 1994), and then more recently in 2003 when
numerous sites were tested for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) and/or National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility (Willis and Peterson 2003). The 2003 work was completed
ahead of a proposed land purchase with the General Land Office (GLO), the current owner of the
land, and a future developer. This plan was presumably based upon the 1997 Texas Historical
Commission Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the GLO concerning the East Lake
Blockup Area, El Paso County, Texas (courtesy of client records) in which 18 sites were
recommended for further evaluation (see Appendix 1 for a copy of the MOU). The results of that
work by Willis and Peterson under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) permits 2923 and 3016 were
concurred upon by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) on August 13, 2003, which noted
that, of the 18 sites tested, one site, a multi-component prehistoric site (41EP155/157), was
recommended as eligible for a SAL designation and warranted protection/avoidance, or data
recovery would be necessary if the site could not be preserved. A comprehensive map of the
distribution of sites in the East Blockup Area is shown in Appendix 2 (Figure 4 from Willis and
Peterson 2003).
A cursory examination of the records pertaining TAC permits 2923 and 3016 led to a
preliminary discussion with the THC, during which it was determined that a reassessment permit
could be issued to assess disturbances at the site. The assessment must indicate which parts of
the site may still retain integrity, and delineate the current site boundaries with sub-meter GPS
accuracy. Current site boundaries, based on the 2003 report, estimate the site to be
approximately 11 acres in size, although the exact location and size of the site on maps in the

1

report are in conflict with the location noted in the THC Sites Atlas database. The site is actually
estimated at 44 acres in size.
In summary, this project conducted under TAC permit 6345 includes the reassessment of site
41EP155/157 on state owned land with permission from the GLO and access obtained by Hunt
Communities, LLC, pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]).

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Environmental Setting
The proposed project area is located in the Rio Grande Valley, within the Rio Grande Watershed,
approximately 1 mile east of the Rio Grande River. The physiography of this region in West
Texas is known as basin and range, characterized by generally north to south trending mountain
ranges separated by wide internal drainage basins or bolsons. El Paso County lies over the
Hueco Basin and is bordered by the Diablo Plateau to the east. The survey area is within in the
Basin and Range Physiographic Province and is located in the Hueco Bolson between the Hueco
Mountains to the East, the Franklin Mountains to the west, the Rio Grande and the Sierra Juarez
to the south.
2.2 Climate
El Paso County is hot in the summer and moderately cold in the winter. In winter, the average
temperature is 48 degrees F and in the summer is 95 degrees F. Rainfall is too light for the
growth of vegetation apart from desert plants. Therefore, irrigation is necessary for farm crops,
gardens, and lawns. More than half of the yearly precipitation occurs in the summer months
during brief thunderstorms. Light snowfall occurs almost every winter, but rarely covers the
ground. In summer, the daytime temperature is usually around 95, and at night, the temperature
falls to the mid-60s. During winter, the temperature usually reaches 55 to 65 degrees. Sunshine
is abundant year round and the climate is extremely arid. In the summer, dust storms and sand
storms are easily formed by a moderately strong wind. These storms are most frequent in March
and April. Although possible, they rarely occur at other times of the year (El-Hage and Moulton
1998). Elevation within the survey area ranges from 3,995 to 4,020 feet.
2.3 Flora
Willis and Peterson (2003) note that the vegetation within the project area is atypical of the
Hueco Bolson and has instead been described as a Mesquite/Broom snakeweed association
(O'Laughlin et al. 1979). Mesquite formed coppice dunes make up approximately one third of
the project area. Common vegetation within the dunes includes four-wing saltbush and
vegetation within the interdunal areas includes broom snakeweed and sporobolis. Creosote,
Yucca elata, and prickly pear were also noted within the project area.
2.4 Soils and Geology
The surface soils identified in the project area have been described in detail by Jaco (1971) as
types within the Hueco-Wink Association with a small portion of the site within the Bluepoint
Association. The Hueco-Wink Association soils occur primarily in in the northern and central
parts of El Paso County. The soils have low organic matter and consist primarily of stabilized
sand dunes covered with mesquite, creosotebush, and annuals. The sediments of the
westernmost portion of the site are from the Bluepoint series which consists of deep sediment
deposits developed over outwash sediments. Current vegetation consists primarily of
5

creosotebush, mesquite, yucca, and four-wing saltbush replacing the native grasses following
over grazing.
Two soil types were noted within the site boundaries and are depicted in Figure 3.
Hueco-Wink fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand, hummocky, 0.5 to 3 percent slopes (HW) â
This soil is generally found on nearly level and gently sloping areas. The Hueco soils consist of
moderately deep fine sandy loam subsoil over caliche. Typically, the stratigraphy consists of a 4
inch surface layer of noncalcarious, brown, loose heavy loamy underlain by a 26 inch subsoil of
brown and yellow-ish brown fine sandy loam. The Wink soils have a similar profile except that
the surface layer and underlying layer are calcareous. The underlying subsoils consist of 32 to
50inches of indurated caliche. The soil has a low moisture capacity.
Bluepoint gravelly sand and loamy fine sand, rolling, 1 to 8 percent slopes (BPC) â This soil is
generally found in gently sloping areas. The surface sediment is generally a very pale brown,
loose, alkaline fine sand which extends to a depth of 60 inches. Twenty-five percent of the
Bluepoint soils consist of a gravelly fine sand. The soils are well drained with a low moisture
contact, slow surface runoff, and rapid permeability.
The Franklin Mountains are a north-south trending fault block that has tilted westward. In this
mountain block formations from the Paleozoic to Holocene are represented (Harbour 1972).
Precambrian cobbles of quartzite, rhyolite porphyry, limestone, basalt, and granite are the
principle source of materials for chipped stone, ground stone, and hearth stone as previously
recorded (Hard et al. 1983).

conditions during the Early Holocene (Bousman 1998). As megafauna gradually died off during
the shift to warmer climates, subsistence patterns shifted toward smaller game and plant
foraging.
Archaic Period
Archaic trends in El Paso County indicate a broader spectrum of subsistence patterns than the
Paleoindian period. Strategies leaned more heavily on gathering than large game hunting and
mobility was slightly more geographically restricted (Shafer 2001). Four temporal phases make
up the Archaic period in this region. These phases are Gardner Springs (8,000-6,300 BP),
Keystone (6,300-4,600 BP), Fresnal (4,600-2,900 BP), and Hueco (2,900 BP-800 BP)
(MacNeish 1993). This temporal scheme requires additional diagnostic markers and excavated
sites with stratified deposits are rare, but the work of Carmichael (1986) and MacNeish (1993)
have provided archaeologists in this area with a solid point of departure for interpreting a
landscape that is heavily deflated, and subject to intensive development and looting.
Gardner Springs (8,000-6,300 BP)
The archaeological record has not yielded as much data on the Gardner Springs phase as the
other subperiods. Projectile point styles that characterize this phase include Jay, Abasolo, and
Bajada (Anderson 1987; Beckett and MacNeish 1994). Small bands hunted smaller game and
exploited numerous types of microenvironmental zones in the spring and summer. Environments
exploited in the fall tended to be riverine, basin floor, and mountain habitats. Exploited winter
sites were typically in the basin floor playas, but also in higher elevations where acorns and
piÃ±on nuts could be stored for long periods of time (Beckett and MacNeish 1994; MacNeish
1993).
Keystone (6,300-4,600 BP)
Like the Gardner phase, the Keystone phase saw fairly static settlement patterns and similar
subsistence strategies. Several Keystone sites have suggested population increases, social stress,
and climatic changes. Projectile point styles indicative of this phase include Bat Cave, Pelona,
Shumla, Gypsum-Almagre, Amargosa, and Todsen. MacNeish states that this phase exhibits âa
subtle shift toward a more efficient desert foraging subsistence system as well as a possible
exploitation of more desert plants from more ecozonesâ (1989:689).
Fresnal (4,600-2,900 BP)
Significant pattern changes occurred during this subperiod. A shift from seasonal camps to more
semi-permanent base camps took place. Domestic plants such as maize, pumpkin, and some
squash began to take dietary precedence over hunted meat according to C12-C13 and N15
proportions examined in human burials (Brown et al. 1995). A higher quantity of recorded
Fresnal sites might also suggest a population increase during this phase. Projectile point styles
exhibited in the Fresnal phase consist of Fresnal, San Jose, Augustin, Chiricahua, and also
Todsen (Beckett and MacNeish 1994; MacNeish 1993).

9

Hueco (2,900 BP-800 BP)
This phase saw a heavier reliance on corn, squash, amaranth, and beans with a shift toward semiÂ­
permanent occupations of sites. Mesoamerican influence is present during the Fresnal phase
(Beckett and MacNeish 1994; MacNeish 1993; MacNeish and Beckett 1987), but these
influences are more apparent in the Hueco phase according to increases in observed cultigens in
the archaeological record (Holmes 2002). This phase also suggests seasonal exploitation of
desert basin resources (Graves and Peterson 1996; Mauldin et al. 1998). Projectile point styles
include Hueco, San Pedro, Armijo, and Hatch (Beckett and MacNeish 1994).
Formative Period
The presence of brownware ceramics marks the onset of the Formative period. This
incorporation of pottery into the relatively mobile lifeway indicates an important change in food
preparation and storage. The Formative period is divided into regional periods correlated with
local phases. The five temporal designations that make up the Formative period in this area are
the Early Pithouse Period/Early Mesilla Phase (1,800-1,400 BP), Late Pithouse Period/Late
Mesilla Phase (1,400-1,000 BP), Transitional Pithouse Period/DoÃ±a Ana Phase (1,000-800 BP),
Pueblo Period/El Paso Phase (800-600 BP), and the Post El Paso Phase (600 BP to European
contact).
Early Pithouse Period/Early Mesilla Phase (1,800-1,400 BP)
The Mesilla phase is characterized by data recovered during large scale surveys in the Hueco
Bolson and Tularosa Basin (Carmichael 1986; Whalen 1977, 1978, 1980). Recorded sites
indicated short-term camps associated with larger playas of concentrated resources. The Early
Mesilla phase is very much a continuation of the mobile settlement patterns of the Late Archaic
with the addition of ceramics and a major population surge (Carmichael 1986). Ceramic
assemblages typically consist of plain brownwares in the form of bowls, deep bowls, tecomates,
and short-necked jars. Diagnostic lithics include San Pedro projectile points, oval basin metates,
and one-handed manos.
Late Pithouse Period/Late Mesilla Phase (1,400-1,000 BP)
The population increase observed in the Early Mesilla continued to increase significantly more in
the Late Mesilla (Whalen 1981:82-83). Sites from this phase are observed in both the basin floor
and edges of the Hueco Bolson. Aggregated pithouse villages such as Turquoise Ridge and Los
Tules formed at this time. Subsistence strategies centered around the gathering of wild plants and
the hunting of small game, particularly rabbits. Ceramic assemblages consisted primarily of plain
brownware ceramics in the form of hemispherical bowls, deep bowls, tecomates, short-necked
jars, and ladles. Intrusive ceramics from neighboring Mogollon regions such as Alma Plain,
Alma Nick-Banded, Three Circle Red-on-white, Three Circle Nick-Corrugated, Mimbres Style I
and Style II have been documented at several Late Mesilla sites (Dering et al. 2001). Changes in
projectile point styles consist of corner-notched, expanding-stem arrow points which signify a
transition to bow and arrow hunting strategies that complimented or replaced atlatl hunting
10

during this phase. However, wooden shafts with sharpened tips have also been recovered from
Late Mesilla contexts (Cosgrove 1947).
Transitional Pithouse Period/DoÃ±a Ana Phase (1,000-800 BP)
Diagnostic architectural elements from the DoÃ±a Ana Phase consist of rectangular pithouses as
well as small huts (Dering et al. 2001:48). The distribution of sites tended to rest along
mountainous outwash fans at the basin edge rather than the basin floor, possibly due to increased
corn consumption (Whalen 1994). Additional data gathered on new styles of metates and manos
also suggest a heavier reliance on corn processing (Carmichael 1986). Corn consumption was
steady, but not necessarily grown locally. It may have been traded during interactions with more
sedentary Mimbres communities (Shafer et al. 1999). Locally painted wares entered ceramic
assemblages during the DoÃ±a Ana Phase such as El Paso Bichrome and early style El Paso
Polychrome. Mimbres Style III Black-on-white ceramics are also very common in DoÃ±a Ana
components. It is possible that the DoÃ±a Ana phase was a local cultural manifestation that was
briefly incorporated into the Classic Mimbres regional system (Schafer et al. 1999).
Pueblo Period/El Paso Phase (800-600 BP),
This phase of the Pueblo period experienced growth in settlements, larger residential units, a
population increase, more specialized site types, increased ceremonialism, and more interaction
with surrounding cultural regions (Dering et al. 2001). Diagnostic architectural traits of the El
Paso Phase include the presence of surface pueblos. Motifs in rock art dating primarily to the El
Paso phase people is not unlike symbolism found in other Pueblo period art (Dering et al. 2001).
This increase in ceremonial expressionism could be attributed to a heavier reliance on agriculture
(Dering et al. 2001), or may be a result of Mimbres influence from the DoÃ±a Ana phase (Shafer
1996). Subsistence data suggests more intensive use of domesticates than any previous period.
Floral inventories included corn (8- and 10-row cobs), beans, gourd, mesquite, prickly pear,
amaranth, tornillo, sunflower, yucca, etc. (Browning et al. 1993, Foster and Bradley 1984;
Whalen 1980). Diagnostic ceramic assemblages consist of classic or late-style El Paso
Polychrome jars with everted rims, restricted-orifice, necked jars, and hemispherical bowls
(Moore 1947; Wheat 1955). Intrusive diagnostic ceramics include Ramos Polychrome, Villa
Ahumada Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-white, Las Lunas Smudged, Playa Red Incised, St.
Johnâs Polychrome, Fourmile, Pinedale, Pinto Gila, and Tonto polychromes. This phase of the
Pueblo period is considered the apex of socioeconomic complexity in the Hueco Bolson
embodying numerous manifestations of the Southwest with influences from Mountain Mogollon,
Casas Grandes, and Salado cultures (Dering et al. 2001).
Post El Paso Phase (600 BP to European contact)
The abandonment of sites during the late Formative period has been a speculative topic. It could
be attributed to a shift in bison herd migration, climatic changes, internal conflict, collapse of
trading alliances, warfare, or a combination of variables (Holmes 2002; Dering et al. 2001).

3.2 Historic Background
Protohistoric Period
In Texas, the first exposure to European contact comes with the arrival of Alva NuÃ±ez Cabeza de
Vaca and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition in 1528. Between 1528 and the late
1600s, Spanish excursions into the Texas territory were limited. Europeans did not begin to settle
the territory until the beginning of the eighteenth century, and still the inhabitants of the region
were mostly Native Americans until the late 1700s.The Protohistoric period pertains to the first
Spanish accounts of the landscape in present-day El Paso continuing until more permanent
Spanish settlement in the 1650s when missions were built to convert the Sumas and Mansos.
Europeans first entered the El Paso area on April 28, 1598 when Don Juan de OÃ±ate and a party
of settlers and soldiers forded the Rio Grande (Brown et al. 1995).
The Manso, Suma, and Jumano Indians inhabited the El Paso Valley on both sides of the Rio
Grande River during the Protohistoric period. The Mansos lived in the area of modern El Paso
and to the north, and the Sumas lived south of El Paso. They subsisted primarily on fishing, deer
and bison hunting, plant gathering, and corn crops (Griffin 1983). The Jumano Indians occupied
the area east of present-day El Paso. They were primarily hunter-gatherers but some bands
farmed land at La Junta (Holmes 2002). Some data suggests that a shift in site locations might be
due to more defensively planned sites (Gibbs et al. 2000). The material culture of Native
Americans in this area soon changed with the introduction of Spanish metals. The period is
concluded with the establishment of a strong Spanish presence in the region in the mid- 1600s
and early 1700âs. Sporadic encounters between the indigenous populations and Europeans
occurred at this time. Identifying this period archaeologically is problematic since a clear set of
material culture associated with this period is lacking. Protohistoric sites may have mixture of
Late Formative and Historic artifacts.
Historic Period
This period begins in 1659 with the establishment of MissiÃ³n de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe.
After the conclusion of the Pueblo Revolt in northern New Mexico, Spanish and northern New
Mexico Indian refugees fled southward to present-day El Paso. By 1684, the settlement had
spread far beyond the walls of the MissiÃ³n de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe. The San Lorenzo,
Senuco, Ysleta, and Socorro Native American communities had established permanent farming
villages. However, strife with Spanish leaders, coupled with disease, drought, and war soon led
to the abandonment of numerous settlements. During the early part of the nineteenth century,
New Spain gained its independence as a result of the Napoleonic invasion of its motherland,
forming the new nation of Mexico. Mexico enabled the additional settlement of Texas by
allowing Anglo settlers, led by Stephen F. Austin, the opportunity to inhabit the region. After
the influx of the Anglo settlers, a movement for independence from Mexico was underway by
the 1830s. The Republic of Texas was incorporated into the United States in 1845. One year
later, the United States seized the El Paso area declaring the Rio Grande as the official border
(Timmons 1990).
12

The individuals in the El Paso area were an old and valued part of the Republic of Mexico and
had little involvement in the Republic of Texas period from 1836-1845. Following the Mexican
War and the resulting Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 all the area north of the Rio Grande
became part of the United States. At that time the El Paso passageway became very important to
the United States and the Texas Legislature proclaimed Sante Fe County, which included modern
El Paso County. In 1849 meetings were held in Austin to determine how to establish El Paso and
establish control over the passage way. Two frontiersmen were sent out to organize the area and
the same year a military force was sent from San Antonio to establish a military post in El Paso.
This post, established by a company of 275 soldiers, later became known as Fort Bliss.
In 1850, Sante Fe County was divided into four counties including El Paso County. San
Elizario, the ancient Spanish presidio town was chosen to be the county seat. By 1860, El Paso
County had a population of 4,456 and a strong agricultural base. In 1860 the census showed only
fifteen slaves in the area, however in 1861 the county voted strongly in support of secession.
Although the county had many troops present little combat occurred and Fort Bliss was
surrendered peacefully to the Confederates.
In the 1880âs El Paso County was a violent place politically. Political conflicts, such as the Salt
War of San Elizario, which resulted in a riot and murder in the streets resulted in the need for
government control. Much of this de-stabilization and un-rest was exacerbated by the economic
down-turn also occurring throughout the region. Farming and cattle ranching were seeing a
particularly difficult decade. This particular unrest caused the government to re-garrison Fort
Bliss to help stabilize the region. El Pasoâs economy grew steadily during the 1890âs and the
early 20th century. Farms increased and cattle ranching increased in economic viability. By
1929, cotton became an incredibly important crop for the region and chicken and eggs also
increased in importance. Manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and workers all suffered through the
Great Depression. The increase in personnel and enlargement of Fort Bliss during World War II
helped the El Paso community recover following the Great Depression. Fort Bliss remains an
important economic element of El Paso today.
4.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
A literature review of the THC Archeological and Historic Sites databases, historic maps, and
records from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) revealed that 123 sites, all
prehistoric, have been recorded within one mile of Site 41EP155/157 (Figure 4). Site
information is summarized in Table 2.
Many of the sites within a mile of the project area were first recorded by during a survey of the
Public Free School Lands of El Paso County (Lynn et al. 1975). A number of sites, including
site 41EP155/157, were given eligibility recommendation for status as SALs. An additional
parcel was surveyed by the El Paso Archeological Society prior to construction of the East El
Paso Reliever Airport (DeGarmo 1983). All the sites, as a group, were recommended as eligible
for listing on the NRHP along with a proposed two phase plan for mitigation (see Table 2, sites
13

recorded in 1982). However, records regarding additional work on the property prior to airport
construction were not located. Recommendation for treatment of these sites recorded in
DeGarmo (1983) were not specifically made in the 1997 THC (MOU) with the GLO concerning
the East Lake Blockup Area, El Paso County, Texas, which was based on the work performed by
Kauffman (1994) as a cultural resources overview (desktop) document of the East El Paso
Planned Community development. However, the report by the El Paso Archeological Society
(DeGarmo 1983) was mentioned in the text of the MOU.
In addition to those projects, two prehistoric sites (Sites 41EP5578 and 41EP5579) were
recorded by Perez (2005) during a wastewater line survey. Burt and Enrst (2006) also recorded
two prehistoric sites within one mile of the project area during a linear water utilities survey
(Sites 41EP5805 and 41EP5806). Willis and Peterson (2003) conducted the most recent cultural
resource investigations in the area including an assessment of site 41EP155/157 along with seven
other sites located within a mile of site 41EP155/157. These additional sites (41EP55, 41EP111,
41EP116, 41EP117, 41EP120, 41EP121, and 41EP175) were determined not eligible for
inclusion on the NRHP or listing as a SAL. The majority of previously recorded sites were
recorded as campsites defined by hearth features and associated artifact scatters.

4.1 Overview of Site 41EP155/157
Site 41EP155/157 was originally recorded in 1974 (Lynn et al. 1974) as two open campsites with
100-200 exposed hearths scattered over a large area. Material collected from the surface by the
original recorder at site 41EP155/157 included 1 stemmed biface, 2 biface fragments, 2
mano/metate combinations, 182 El Paso brownware sherds, 23 El Paso Polychrome sherds, 10
Chupadero Black-on-white sherds, and 1 plainware. . Site 41EP157 was subsumed within the
extended boundaries of site 41EP155 during resurvey of the project (Willis and Peterson 2003).
Willis and Peterson (2003) describe the site as being located on the escarpment of the Rio
Grande Valley and extending onto the desert floor north and east of the escarpment. Site
dimensions were given as approximately 600 meters north/south by 400 meters east/west in size,
extending from the bare caliche escarpment edge to the sheet sands and large coppice mesquites
dunes that dominate most of the intact portions of the site farther east and northeast. About 80
percent of the site was felt to be intact, but the area was threatened by drivers of off-road
vehicles as well as the erosion associated with the hydrology of the escarpment. The site
boundaries were based on the extent of thermal feature surface manifestations (Figure 5). The
majority of artifacts were found near thermal features and in blowouts or other deflated zones.
Rough estimates of the total number of artifacts range into the tens of thousands with the
majority of artifacts being lithics, groundstone and ceramics following in lesser numbers. One
complete projectile point and two fragments were found. The common types of ceramics found
during investigations at site 41EP155/157 were El Paso brownware and El Paso Polychrome
sherds. A total of 620 thermal features were found across the surface of the site. Five-hundredÂ­
and-ninety nine of the features are made-up of burned caliche and/or fire-cracked rock in various
states of deflation. Trowel testing of the features found that 174 contained ash-stained sands
and/or other charcoal remains.
Detailed recordation and mapping of the features revealed distinct loci of feature density. Locus
1 is located near the center of the site, northeast of the escarpment about equidistant between the
two dirt roads that cross the site, and covers an area 80 meters northeast/southwest by 30 meters
northwest/southeast. Locus 2 is located in the southeast portion of the site in the somewhat stable
dunes at the edge of the escarpment and is 43 meters northeast/southwest by 122 meters
northwest/southeast in size. The highest concentrations of intact features are located within
Locus 1. This area is partially sheltered by large dunes and has had far less impact from
recreational vehicles than much of the rest of the site. The lack of intact features within Locus 2
is likely due to a higher amount of erosion around the escarpment edge. The highest density of
artifacts associated with features also occurs within the two loci but cover a larger area. When
compared to other sites in the region, 41EP155 stands out in the sheer number and density of
features.

21

Radiocarbon dates recovered from the features included Middle Archaic period hearths circa
1800 B.C. as well as features dating to the Late Archaic period. The range of dates and intact
features indicate that the land surface appears to be intact and contain intact matrix from the
periods of deposition. The site also has a Late Prehistoric component indicated by Chupadero
Black-on-white and El Paso Polychrome sherds.
It was noted by Willis and Peterson (2003) that the site contained a high density of artifacts, firecracked rock, and burned caliche with apparently intact deposits from a very long range of
settlement periods ( see Figure 5). This diversity of artifacts and materials demonstrate that this
site has the potential to contribute data toward understanding the prehistory of the region. The
Late Prehistoric occupations represent a poorly known period of the Jornada Mogollon
prehistory when increased feature construction and occupational intensity occur and are
characteristic of the latter half of the Late Archaic period. The presence of âtransitionalâ Middle
to Late Archaic dates from Feature 6 at site 41EP155/157 supports previous findings that Middle
Archaic house structures and hearth features tend to be more common near the Rio Grande
Valley (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004) or other permanent or semi-permanent water sources (Miller
et al. 2006). Feature 6 and other potential Middle Archaic or transitional Middle/Late Archaic
occupations at site 41EP155/157 were recommended to be a major focus of future data recovery
programs.
Site 41EP155/157 is a uniquely large and diverse site. The density and diversity of features, the
extent of feature distribution and the diversity within the artifact assemblage all confirm the
importance of this locality within the region. Discovery of a small circular feature at Site
41EP157 within the present bounds of site 41EP155/157 suggests that during the Late Archaic
there was a diversity of features that might be discovered at this site with further study. The
deposits at the site produced radiocarbon age estimates from two separate areas which confirmed
the accuracy of the determinations from features at the site. This indicates that the site has the
potential for intact cultural deposits associated with their original depositional matrix. The large
number of features, where 614 were recorded during the testing phase for this project, coupled
with the sheer density of features within the site boundaries, demonstrates the presence of
settlement here from throughout the region.
5.0 FIELD METHODS
The first objective of the project includes the definition of the current boundaries of the site in
order to reconcile discrepancies in previously recorded site boundaries as well as document any
changes in the boundaries of the site following the last time it was recorded nine years ago
(Willis and Peterson 2003). The second objective is to assess the level of disturbance to the site.
This was done through assessing the condition of cultural features, primarily hearths, as well as
noting other types of general disturbances including natural factors such as erosion and manmade
disturbances such as dirt roads.

23

Definition of Current Site Boundaries
The first step in defining the site boundaries was to complete east-west transects across the
southern boundary of the previously recorded area of the site and relocate a previously recorded
set survey reference point in order to confirm the GPS site boundary data correlated with field
observations. This was followed by one crew member walking the previously recorded site
boundary using a handheld GPS and confirming the existence of the site along the boundary. A
second crew member then walked 10 to 20 meters outside the previously recorded site boundary
in order to confirm the presence or absence of indications that the site extended beyond the
previously recorded boundary.
Once the site boundary was verified, two persons re-walked boundary and placed flagging
(candy striped, then red/orange) in bushes on or just outside of the boundary. Flags were placed
to be visible from one to another, and usually could be viewed as a continuous line. The client
confirmed that the flagging would be sufficient, and the archaeologists met with surveyor to
explain the method of flagging. The site boundary was documented using a TrimbleÂ® through
the collection of a polygon data set. The surveyor would also record the flagged boundary with
their own equipment as requested by the client for planning purposes. Reference points with
accurate coordinates had already been set, so the site boundary would conform to the same
coordinates. Once the boundary was recorded the flagging was removed.
Relocation and Evaluation of Disturbance to Features
Previously recorded features were first relocated through use of the GPS. Through the process of
relocating features and assessing site boundaries, additional features were discovered, some of
which were photographed and recorded. Both previously recorded and newly discovered
features were trowel tested to determine whether charcoal stained soil and or charcoal or ash
were present. This was the primary criteria to determine whether features remained intact.
Shovel testing was not conducted as the features were clearly visible on the surface throughout
the site. No artifacts were collected.
Documentation of General Site Condition
Disturbance to the site was photographed and disturbances noted on aerial photographs of the
project area were also confirmed.
6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
Current Site Boundaries
The accuracy of the majority of the previously recorded site boundary was confirmed. In several
instances the boundary was adjusted based upon visual observation of features. The boundary
along the southwestern line was reduced to the north and the line smoothed to create more
uniform boundary (Figure 6). The western boundary was expanded to the west to enclose
features observed. As noted in the field methods section above, the current site boundary was
recorded with sub meter accuracy by aci consulting staff and flagged to the satisfaction of the
client for the professional surveyor to record for planning purposes.
