ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a 10.592 acre tract, the site of the proposed Villa West
Park, was conducted in February 1998 by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of
Bryan, Texas with William E. Moore acting as Principal Investigator under Antiquities
Permit 1946. The area was investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported
by shovel testing. The entire project area contained shallow soils and is considered a low
probability area for the presence of prehistoric sites. No prehistoric or historic sites were
found within the project area, and it is recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed as planned. Copies of the report and field notes are on file at BVRA and the City
of Bryan. Copies of the report are also present at the Division of Antiquities Protection,
Texas Historical Commission and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
in Austin, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates was retained by the City of Bryan to conduct a
cultural resources survey for the proposed Villa West Park in central Brazos County
(Figure 1). The project area consists of 10.592 acres and is described in the field notes
prepared by the City of Bryan (Appendix I). The project area is bounded on the south by
Villa Maria Road, on the east by Mary Branch Elementary School, and on the north and
west by private land holdings (Figure 2). The field survey was conducted on two days,
February 11 and 13, 1998 and was performed by the Principal Investigator (William E.
Moore).
No federal regulatory agency was involved in this project which was reviewed at
the State level by the Division of Antiquities Protection (DAP), Texas Historical
Commission. Since this project is being supported by state funds, an Antiquities Permit
from DAP was required, and permit number 1946 was assigned to this project. The
BVRA project number is 98-01. The project area is depicted on United States Geological
Survey topographical maps, Chances Store dated 1962 and photorevised 1980 and
Bryan West dated 1962 and photorevised 1971. The project area as superimposed on
the topographic maps appears as Figure 3 in this report.
The nearest water source is Turkey Creek. The main channel of this drainage is
about 450 meters south of the project area, and two of its tributaries are 200 meters to the
west and 350 meters to the east. Topographically, the project area is on the southern
slope of an upland, the apex of which is to the north and out of the area examined during
this investigation. Prehistoric sites have been recorded in the vicinity. Site 41BZ2 is the
nearest to the project area at approximately 100 meters to the southeast. Site 41BZ73 is
approximately 1300 meters northeast, and site 41BZ89 is approximately 4000 meters
southwest. Prehistoric sites found in Brazos County are typically situated on sandy ridges
and uplands close to dependable sources of water, mainly creeks and rivers. No
prehistoric sites in the county have been reported on clay hills or in areas where clay is
close to the surface.
Proposed construction includes a soccer field, picnic areas, trails, basketball
pavilion, playgrounds, volleyball court, outdoor classroom, restrooms, and horseshoe
pits. The park has been designed to incorporate the wooded areas. It is the intention of
the City of Bryan to remove as few trees as possible.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
The field survey was supplemented by a check of records housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas and an examination of
archaeological site reports and other manuscripts. The records at TARL were checked
for a listing of known sites in the project area. The Principal Investigator did all
background research.
The area was examined on February 11 and 13, 1998 with William E. Moore acting as
Principal Investigator. The project area was investigated utilizing the pedestrian survey
method supported by shovel testing. Shovel tests were excavated on the higher
elevations and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill was screened through
1/4 inch hardware cloth.* Data obtained from shovel testing were recorded on a shovel
test log (Appendix II). In all, 25 shovel tests were dug, and each test was backfilled. The
western boundary of the project area was not flagged and, as a result, shovel tests 9 and
10 were excavated to the west of and outside the project area. This error was discovered
on the second day of survey when Roy G. Ross of the City of Bryan visited the project
area and defined the western boundary.
Shovel tests were dug to clay. They averaged 30 centimeters in diameter and
varied in depth from clay at the surface (05 cm) to 40 centimeters below the existing
ground surface. The average depth of the 25 tests was 18.52 centimeters. Basic soil
descriptions were taken from Soil Conservation Service (SCS) soil surveys published for
the area obtained at the local SCS office (Mowery et al. 1958). This office is now referred
to as the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service. Field notes were taken by the Project Archaeologist.

* Due to the wet conditions, all soil was placed in the screen and examined by hand.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated within
the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized by gently
rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or sands. The
climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be predominately warm.
Annual rainfall for the county is 39.21 inches. A January minimum temperature of 42
degrees and a July maximum temperature of 95 degrees combine to produce a growing
season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180). The altitude varies from 200-400
feet. The project area is located on a tract of land that is bounded on three sides by
Turkey Creek and its tributaries.
According to the soil survey for Brazos County published in 1958 (Mowery et al.
1958:Sheet 31), the majority of the project area contains soils belonging to the Tabor
Series. Soils in this series are of moderate to low productivity and occur on gently sloping
uplands in most parts of the county. They were developed from alkaline to slightly acid
sandy clay. The natural vegetation consists of a scrubby hardwood forest and an
understory consisting of shrubs and vines and a thin stand of bunchgrass (Mowery
1958:13). The specific soil type in the project area is described as Tabor fine sandy loam,
1 to 3 percent slopes (Ta). A characteristic profile for Tabor fine sandy loam contains a
pale brown, slightly acid fine sandy loam (friable when moist, slightly hard when dry) from
0-7 inches; a very pale brown, acid fine sandy loam (very friable when moist) from 7-10
inches; and a light yellowish-brown, strongly acid clay mottled with yellow and with a few
yellowish-red spots (very slowly permeable; very firm when moist; very sticky and plastic
when wet; and extremely hard when dry) from 10-26 inches. Although the soils in Brazos
County are being reevaluated, the field survey appeared to confirm the soils in the project
area are at least similar to the Tabor fine sandy loam fine sandy loam as described above.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been
recorded in the project area. There was also no indication that any part of the 10.592 acre
tract had been surveyed by professional archaeologists. The reader is referred to recent
contract reports by BVRA for a discussion of previous work in the county (Moore 1989a,
1989b, 1992, 1993, 1994a, 1994b, 1994c, 1996). Aerial photography present in the Soil
Survey of Brazos County, Texas taken in the 1950s (Mowery et al. 1958:Sheet 31)
depicts a tract that contains soils of the Tabor Series (see Environmental Setting above).
No prehistoric or historic sites were found in the project area. The soils were
shallow with the deepest shovel test encountering clay at only 40 centimeters. The
average depth of the 25 shovel tests was 18.52 centimeters of sandy loam above a
reddish clay. It is, therefore, assumed that the landform along this segment of Turkey
Creek was not a desirable location for prehistoric settlement. The project area was
adequately assessed. First, the entire 10.59 acres was walked with the Principal
Investigator walking 20 meter transects in an attempt to locate any surface indication of
prehistoric or historic sites. Next, a close inspection was made of all exposed areas,
primarily eroded hillsides and the existing trails. The subsurface was examined through
the excavation of 25 shovel tests. An average of 2.38 shovel tests per acre was achieved
in an area that was determined to be low probability for prehistoric site occurrence due
mainly to the presence of shallow soils overlying a firm clay containing red and yellow
mottlings. Of particular note, is the presence of numerous pieces of silicified wood
throughout the project area, on the surface and in the shovel tests. Several large logs
were observed as well as large sandstone boulders. No sandstone was encountered in
any of the shovel tests or noted except in the form of scattered boulders throughout the
project area.
The extent of disturbance to the project area is not known. However, there
currently exists a network of trails that has subjected parts of the tract to erosion. Along
the eastern boundary, adjacent to Mary Branch school, is a slope that was obviously
created during construction of the school. The project area at this point overlooks the
school grounds below. Along the slope erosion is currently active. It is in this area where
the surface exposure was the greatest. The aerial photograph in the soil survey for
Brazos County shows the project area to be partly wooded and cleared, perhaps for
pasture or cultivation.
The survey was conducted on two days following heavy rains, and the presence of
standing water and wet soils throughout the project area combine to create a landscape
that would not be favored for prehistoric sites. Sites in the vicinity are all located on sandy
ridges containing well drained soils.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is the opinion of Brazos Valley Research Associates that there are no significant
cultural resource sites present in the 10.592 acre project area.
As a result of this
investigation, it is recommended that the City of Bryan be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned. It is always possible that cultural materials are missed during
any cultural resources survey. Should areas containing prehistoric or historic artifacts be
discovered during construction, the Division of Antiquities Protection must be notified
immediately and work stopped until the situation can be evaluated.
