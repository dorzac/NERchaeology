MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. (Magellan), contract operator of Longhorn Partners
Pipeline, L.P.’s Longhorn Pipeline, conducted emergency maintenance activities at 4 locations
along the existing Longhorn Pipeline right-of-way (ROW) within Gillespie and Blanco counties,
Texas. The maintenance activities consisted of the repair of portions of the pipeline due to the
presence of anomalies at each of the 4 locations. To conduct the “pig dig” repairs, the pipeline
was unearthed and encircled with a metal repair sleeve, or similar repair method. To conduct
the “re-coats,” the pipeline was unearthed, cleaned, and then recoated. All excavation was
restricted to the existing ROW and was confined to areas previously disturbed by original
pipeline construction and intervening pipeline and ROW maintenance. All 4 maintenance
locations were located on private lands and do not require federal funding, licensure, permitting,
or approval. At the request of Magellan, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 4 maintenance locations on 2 April
2007, prior to the maintenance activities. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
cultural resources were located in these areas, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources survey of the 4 maintenance locations resulted in entirely
negative findings at all 4 of the locations. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural materials were
observed at any of the 4 locations. If any cultural materials had been present, they would have
been confined to surface contexts by the exposed limestone bedrock or shallow, gravelly clay
deposits prevalent along the ROW. No areas containing any potential for deeply buried,
stratified cultural deposits were observed at any of the 4 assessed locations. Based on the
negative results of the cultural resources survey at these 4 locations, as well as the low potential
for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the maintenance
activities at the 4 locations have no potential for impact on significant cultural resources or
historic properties listed in or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and that no further
investigations are warranted.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. (Magellan), contract operator of Longhorn Partners
Pipeline, L.P.’s Longhorn Pipeline, conducted emergency maintenance activities at 4 locations
along the existing Longhorn Pipeline right-of-way (ROW) within Gillespie and Blanco counties,
Texas. The sections of the pipeline containing the 4 maintenance locations were internally
inspected during an integrity verification measure intended to meet the requirements of 49 CFR
Part 195.452, Pipeline Integrity Management. The results of the inspection indicated the
presence of certain pipeline anomalies that required immediate repair. To conduct the “pig dig”
repairs, the pipeline was unearthed and encircled with a metal repair sleeve, or similar repair
method. To conduct the “re-coats,” the pipeline was unearthed, cleaned, and then recoated. All
excavation was restricted to the existing ROW and was confined to areas previously disturbed
by original pipeline construction and intervening pipeline and ROW maintenance. All 4
maintenance locations were located on private lands and do not require federal funding,
licensure, permitting, or approval. At the request of Magellan, Horizon Environmental Services,
Inc. (Horizon) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 4 maintenance locations
on 2 April 2007, prior to the maintenance activities. The purpose of the survey was to determine
if any cultural resources were located in these areas, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of each of the 4 maintenance locations, and the production of a report
suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the
Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27,
and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal
Investigator for the project. Reign Clark (Horizon project archeologist) conducted the field
investigations on 2 April 2007.
In all, the assessed areas totaled approximately 2.3 acres, including areas adjacent to
each maintenance location that were visually assessed. This equates to approximately 2033.6
feet (620.0 meters [m]) of overall ROW length with a width of 50 feet (15.3 m). The location,
description, and results of the investigations at each maintenance location are presented
together in Section 4 of this report following the general cultural background of Central Texas in

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

Section 2 and a description of the general methods employed during the investigation in Section
3.
In summary, the cultural resources survey of the 4 maintenance locations resulted in
entirely negative findings at all 4 of the locations. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural
materials were observed at any of the 4 locations. If any cultural materials had been present,
they would have been confined to surface contexts by the exposed limestone bedrock or
shallow, gravelly clay deposits prevalent along the ROW. No areas containing any potential for
deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits were observed at any of the 4 assessed locations.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey at these 4 locations, as well as
the low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
maintenance activities at the 4 locations have no potential for impact on significant cultural
resources or historic properties listed in or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and that no further
investigations are warranted.

2.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of western Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical
sequence: PaleoIndian, 9200 to 6000 BC; Archaic, 6000 BC to AD 800; Late Prehistoric, AD
800 to 1600; and Historic, 1600 to 1870.

2.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9200 TO 6000 BC)

The PaleoIndian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence (Weir
1976; Prewitt 1981), although the best known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of large
mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as the
Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that during the early part of the
PaleoIndian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth, bison,
and horse), as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the PaleoIndian period, the Folsom stage, subsistence seems
to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game, particularly bison. This
presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working, and kill sites, mostly in or near
grassland habitats, are all that have been documented (Collins 1995:382). This change was
most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer and drier than the previous
Clovis stage.

2.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6000 BC TO AD 800)

The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar transition found worldwide at approximately the same time; the most noted indicators being the extinction of
Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual decrease in
moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends first noted
during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic changes was a
greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the case in most
places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth ovens become

more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued. Although still
nomadic, Archaic people restricted their travel to smaller areas than did the PaleoIndian groups.
The Archaic period, which covers two-thirds of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995),
is divided into 3 subperiods: Early (6000 to 3000 BC), Middle (3000 to 1000 BC), and Late
(1000 BC to AD 800) (Hester 1986). Each period is represented by specific point styles. The
Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from PaleoIndian
lanceolate-shaped points to notched and stemmed points. Overall, the Early Archaic patterns in
Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) wrote that, prior to 3000 BC, the late
Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in terms of subsistence
strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau Prairie, South Texas
Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyonlands. After this date, regionally distinctive projectile points
emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that the Early Archaic typological
developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments in Central and Southwestern
Texas, as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid, climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open camp sites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and a cave, Hall’s Cave.
Lithic materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones,
projectile points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork
and Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late PaleoIndian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).
The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population distribution, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and
changes in settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and
McGraw 1985:38). Hester (1986) suggests that during this period, the inhabitants of the
Balcones Escarpment region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of
abundant regional resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
the upland areas, and special activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large, burned rock features (hearths as well as rock ovens) of the
early part of the Middle Archaic give way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens
(Collins 1995). These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different
subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represented intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more

frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. Middle Archaic projectile points include
the Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is considered by
Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment region.
The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of burned
rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter part of this
period (Collins 1995).
Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic and may reflect the
establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Story 1985:49; Black 1989:30; Black
and McGraw 1985). Hester (1986) suggests the development of wide-ranging trade contacts
may have also occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile points include triangular
types such as Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with the smaller, expanding stem points
such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.

2.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 800 TO 1600)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca AD 800 to 1300) and Toyah (ca AD 1300 to 1600). The Austin phase is characterized by
the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow points,
particularly the expanding, stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Prewitt 1974; Black 1989; Collins 1995).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contracting
stem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited agriculture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

2.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 1600 TO PRESENT)

The Historic period, which began with the arrival of Europeans into the region, can be
divided into 3 subperiods: early, middle, and late. Only a brief overview of the period is given
here. For a more detailed essay, see Newcomb 1993:1-63.
The first documented arrival of Europeans into Central Texas dates to the early 18th
century (Newcomb 1993). Their influence, however, preceded their arrival. In the late 17th

HJN 050175 AR

5

Chapter 2.0: Cultural Background

century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began migrating into Central Texas
to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines, missions, and on Spanish
ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the Spanish had become an
integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison hunters of the High
Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They terrorized native
groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to flee, some into
Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region encountered native
groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the Apache, and the
diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their accounts, therefore, do
not provide direct analogs to prehistoric lifeway patterns, but rather represent a time of drastic
cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns may have prevailed through
time. Along with large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic
affiliations, small band-sized residential camps, both dating to this particular period, are found in
Central Texas (Collins 1995:386). These latter sites may represent indigenous groups.
The middle Historic subperiod began about 1730 and ended about 1800 as the mission
system was failing (Hester 1989; Collins 1995:386). Historic documents of this period make
reference to remnants of native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins
1995). Toward the end of this subperiod, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern
Texas from the high plains. Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be
highly biased since they are provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers
(Collins 1995).
The late Historic subperiod is composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung
nomadic native groups (primarily the Comanche),” and an archeological record of the European
presence (Collins 1995:387). The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th
century. Their final demise heralded the end of Native American presence in Central Texas.

Pipeline Right-of-Way in Gillespie and Blanco Counties, Texas

3.0 GENERAL METHODOLOGY

Prior to the field effort, Horizon conducted archival research via the Internet at the THC’s
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas restricted database web site (the Atlas) in order to determine if
any previously recorded archeological sites were documented within the vicinity of each of the
maintenance locations, and if any previous cultural resources assessments had been conducted
near each location. The results of the archival research are presented in Section 4 in
association with each of the maintenance locations.
Following the archival review, a Horizon archeologist completed an intensive pedestrian
survey of the 4 maintenance locations (2 pig digs and 2 re-coats) on 2 April 2007. In general,
this included intensive surface inspection, as well as subsurface shovel testing when possible,
at each maintenance location. In areas where shallow clay soils or exposed bedrock were
present, shovel testing was not conducted. As each pig dig location typically consisted of only a
small area of impact (generally 15 feet [4.6 m] in length), 1 to 2 shovel tests were deemed
substantial enough to assess the deposits at each location. The re-coat sections generally
consisted of several hundred feet of pipe exposure, where 2 to 3 shovel tests were deemed
appropriate. The Texas State Minimum Survey Standards require a minimum of 3 shovel tests
per acre for projects less than 2 acres in size. As each location amounted to considerably less
than 0.25 acres, the 1 to 3 shovel tests at each maintenance location would have exceeded the
Texas State Minimum Survey Standards. The results of the intensive pedestrian survey are
also presented in Section 4 in association with each of the maintenance locations.
In addition to the assessment of each maintenance location, the archeologist also
visually assessed the surface of the existing ROW while en route to each of the locations.
Although no shovel tests were conducted along the areas traveled en route to the maintenance
locations, the ROW surfaces were visually assessed in order to determine if surface cultural
deposits were present or if subsurface deposits that had been unearthed during the initial
construction of the pipeline were exposed. The results of the additional visual assessment are
also presented in Section 4 in association with each of the maintenance locations.
In all, the assessed locations totaled approximately 2.3 acres, including the areas
adjacent to each maintenance location that were visually assessed. This equates to
approximately 2033.6 feet (620.0 m) of overall ROW length with a width of 50 feet (15.3 m).

Chapter 3.0: General Methodology

During the field investigations, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils,
land forms, shovel tests conducted, cultural material observed (if any), etc. If any new
archeological sites were encountered, standardized site forms were to be completed and
submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent housing.
Similarly, “re-visit” forms were to be completed for any previously recorded sites encountered
during the investigations. Standardized shovel tests forms were completed for each excavated
shovel test, and digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The
locations of the 4 maintenance areas and all shovel tests conducted were recorded via
handheld global positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the
NAD 27 map datum.

Pipeline Right-of-Way in Gillespie and Blanco Counties, Texas

4.0 MAINTENANCE LOCATIONS

The 4 maintenance locations (2 pig digs and 2 recoats) are found along a stretch of the
existing Longhorn Pipeline ROW in Gillespie and Blanco counties, Texas. The area
environment, results of archival reviews, and results of field investigations are presented below
in relation to each of the 4 maintenance locations.

4.1

PIG DIG P-100

Pig Dig P-100 is located in northeastern Gillespie County (Figure 1). The maintenance
activity at this location consisted of the excavation of a short section of the pipeline within the
confines of the previously disturbed ROW and repair of the anomaly present.
4.1.1

Area Environment

Pig Dig P-100 is situated on a rocky upland above a drainage of Crabapple Creek,
located a short distance to the east (Figure 2). Exposed granite outcrops are present along the
ROW. Soils at this location are mapped as Ligon soils, undulating (LlC). The Ligon series soils
consist of shallow, gently sloping or undulating soils situated upon uplands. The undulating
classification of the Ligon soil series is specifically described as being situated on broad convex
ridges. Solum consistency is clay loam with a thickness ranging from 12.0 to 20.0 inches (30.0
to 50.0 cm). These soils are underlain by schist (USDA 1975).
4.1.2

Archival Review

A review of the THC’s Atlas database indicated the presence of no previously recorded
sites within 0.6 miles (1.0 kilometers [km]) of Pig Dig P-100 (THC 2007). According to the Atlas,
no formal cultural resources surveys have been conducted in the vicinity of Pig Dig P-100.
4.1.3

Assessment Conducted

During the field assessment, the archeologist excavated 2 shovel tests at the Pig Dig P100 location. Table 1 presents the resulting shovel test data. In addition, the archeologist
conducted surface inspections at this location.

Recommendations

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources assessment at Pig Dig P-100, it
is Horizon’s opinion that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by the maintenance
activities at this location and that no further cultural resources investigations are warranted.
Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for this location.

4.2

PIG DIG P-102

Pig Dig P-102 is located in north-central Gillespie County, roughly 4.7 miles (7.5 km)
west-southwest of Enchanted Rock State Park (Figure 3). The maintenance activity at this
location consisted of the excavation of a short section of the pipeline within the confines of the
previously disturbed ROW and repair of the anomaly present.
4.2.1

Area Environment

The location of Pig Dig P-102 consists of a hill slope covered with exposed bedrock
within the existing ROW (Figure 4). Soils at this location are mapped as Eckert stony soils,
rolling (EcD). The Eckert series soils consist of shallow, stony soils situated upon uplands.
These soils are formed in material formed from hard, siliceous limestone. Typical Eckert soils
are rocky silt loams less than 12.0 inches (30.0 cm) thick, underlain by indurated limestone
bedrock (USDA 1975).
4.2.2

Archival Review

A review of the THC’s Atlas database indicated 1 previously recorded site within 0.6
miles (1.0 km) of Pig Dig P-102 (THC 2007). This site, 41GL335, was recorded as an aboriginal
lithic procurement area located north of the ROW. It was not considered eligible for inclusion in

Cultural Resources Assessments of 4 Maintenance Locations along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P.
Pipeline Right-of-Way in Gillespie and Blanco Counties, Texas

4.2.3

Assessment Conducted

During the field assessment of Pig Dig P-102, the archeologist conducted only a surface
inspection due to the fact that the dig is located within an area composed entirely of exposed
bedrock.
4.2.4

Results

The investigations conducted at Pig Dig P-102 produced entirely negative results. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of this location.
4.2.5

Recommendations

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources assessments at Pig Dig P-102,
as well as the lack of potential for subsurface deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that no significant
cultural resources will be impacted by the maintenance activities at Pig Dig P-102 and that no
further cultural resources investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for this location.

4.3

RE-COAT 11586+75 TO 11590+60

Re-coat 11586+75 to 11590+60 is located in northeastern Gillespie County,
approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km) west of the Gillespie/Blanco county line (Figure 5). The
maintenance activity at this location consisted of the excavation of a roughly 85-foot (25.9-m)
section of the pipeline within the confines of the previously disturbed ROW and subsequent
recoating of the pipe.
4.3.1

Area Environment

Re-coat 11586+75 to 11590+60 is situated on a slope within a cleared pasture (Figure
6). This pasture has been root-plowed to a depth of roughly 8.0 inches (20 cm). Soils at this
location are mapped as Purves soils, undulating (PuC). The Purves series soils consist of
shallow calcareous soils located upon uplands. These soils are formed from weathered
interbedded hard limestone and calcareous marls. Typical Purves soils are shallow rocky clay
loams ranging from 14.0 to 19.0 inches (35.0 to 47.5 cm) thick, underlain by fractured limestone
bedrock (USDA 1975).
4.3.2

Archival Review

A review of the THC’s Atlas database indicated the presence of no previously recorded
sites within 0.6 miles (1.0 km) of Re-coat 11586+75 to 11590+60 (THC 2007). According to the
Atlas, no formal cultural resources surveys have been conducted in the vicinity of this re-coat
location.

4.4

RE-COAT 11115+03 TO 11117+83

Re-coat 11115+03 to 11117+83 was located in north central Blanco County,
approximately 0.7 miles (1.1 km) southwest of the intersection of Farm to Market roads (FM)
1320 and 1323 (Figure 7). The maintenance activity at this location consisted of the excavation
of a roughly 280.0 foot (85.4 m) section of the pipeline within the confines of the previously
disturbed ROW and the subsequent recoating of the pipe.
4.4.1

Area Environment

Re-Coat 11115+03 to 11117+83 is situated in a marshy lowland with standing water
over most of the length of the ROW (Figure 8). Soils at this location are mapped as Hye fine
sandy loam, 1 to 5% slopes. The Hye series soils consist of moderately deep, well-drained soils
formed from weathered sandstone. These soils are generally sandy loam in the upper 12 to 18
inches (30.0 to 45.0 cm). Sandy clay soils exist to a depth of around 36 inches (90 cm). These
soils are underlain by indurated sandstone bedrock (USDA 1979).

5.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the 4 emergency maintenance locations resulted in
entirely negative findings at all 4 of the locations. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural
materials were observed at any of the 4 locations. If any cultural materials had been present,
they would have been confined to surface contexts by the exposed limestone bedrock or
shallow, gravelly clay deposits prevalent along the ROW. No areas containing any potential for
deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits were observed at any of the 4 assessed locations.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey at the 4 emergency
maintenance locations, as well as the low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits,
it is Horizon’s opinion that the maintenance activities at the 4 locations will have no impact on
significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted. Horizon
recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for all 4 emergency maintenance
locations.
