ABSTRACT
On November 28 and December 1, 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton &
Associates) conducted an intensive archeological survey on CR 143 at Seale Creek in Nolan County,
Texas prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction (CSJ: 0983-20-019).
The survey was performed at the request of AIA, Inc., and on behalf of the Texas Department of
Transportation’s Abilene District. Field investigations found no cultural materials and curation was
unnecessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Investigations on CR 143 at Seale Creek in Nolan County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with backhoe trenching and shovel testing prior to proposed roadway improvement
and bridge replacement construction on CR 143 at Seale Creek (CSJ: 0983-20-019). Surface and
subsurface investigations discovered no cultural resources within the project area.
The proposed construction would occur only within the existing CR 143 right-of-way (ROW), which is
approximately 40 to 50 feet wide. The existing unpaved roadway is 18 feet wide feet wide and consists of
two 9-foot wide lanes with no shoulders (see attached the typical sections and the plan and profile). The
current steel I-beam bridge measures 60 feet long by 20 feet wide. Available construction schematics
indicate that the proposed bridge would measure 60 feet long by 26 feet wide and accommodate two 12foot wide lanes. The proposed bridge would consist of one pre-stressed concrete span with T-beams and
the 150-foot long roadway approaches would be widened to match the width of the proposed new
structure. The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) therefore, measures approximately 360 feet in length
and 40 to 50 feet wide. The project area is located in north-central Nolan County approximately four
miles south-southwest of Sweetwater, Texas
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 0.41 acre
DATE OF WORK: November 28 and December 1, 2006.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4326
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Based on the lack of archeological deposits within the project area, Blanton &
Associates, Inc. recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the
existing CR 143 ROW without additional cultural resource investigations. As the proposed project area
has been modified by roadway construction and maintenance, as well as buried utilities, it is unlikely that
intact buried cultural resources would be discovered during construction. If the planned construction
should require additional work space outside of the existing ROW, then additional cultural resource
investigations in those areas would be necessary.

INTRODUCTION
On November 28 and December 1, 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton &
Associates), at the request of AIA, Inc., and on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s
(TxDOT) Abilene District, conducted an intensive archeological survey on CR 143 at Seale Creek in
Nolan County, Texas prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction
(CSJ: 0908-20-019). The project area is located approximately four miles south-southwest of Sweetwater
in north-central Nolan County (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
The proposed highway improvements would involve replacing the existing steel I-beam bridge with a
wider and longer pre-stressed concrete span capable of handling current and future traffic load. In
addition to the bridge replacement, roadway improvements on CR 143 would involve the widening of the
150-foot long approach roadways on the north and south ends of the bridge to match the width of the new
structure. According to available engineering schematics, no new ROW or temporary or permanent
easements are planned for the construction.
The proposed construction would occur only within the existing CR 143 right-of-way (ROW), which is
approximately 40 to 50 feet wide. The existing roadway is 18 feet wide, unpaved, and consists of two
9-foot wide lanes with no shoulders (Figure 2). The existing steel I-beam bridge measures 60 feet long by
20 feet wide. The proposed bridge would consist of one pre-stressed concrete span with T-beams
measuring 60 feet long by 26 feet wide to accommodate two, 12-foot wide lanes and the 150-foot long
roadway approaches would be widened to match the width of the proposed bridge (Figure 3). Vertical
impacts for the bridge support columns would extend approximately 20 feet below the existing ground
surface. The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) measures therefore, approximately 360 feet in length,
40 to 50 feet wide, and encompasses approximately 0.41 acre.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by the state, the project is subject to the
provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of
State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political subdivision of the State of Texas,
defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the laws of this state, including a city,
county, school district, or special district created under the Texas Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or
(2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must identify potential SALs through survey of
public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally
funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the
ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal
agencies.

The federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and in the
regulations of the agencies and federal divisions engaged in historic preservation. Protection of cultural
resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as defined
by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the ACHP is the final arbiter of the Section
106 process, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence by the involved agency
and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the THC.
Investigations were conducted in accordance with the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA)
among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) among TxDOT and THC. The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological
survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC
in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was
to identify and describe all cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural
resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as
avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed project area is located in the Rolling Plains ecological region of Texas, which is
characterized by a gently undulating to rolling plain. Elevations across the Rolling Plains range from
approximately 1,000 feet in the eastern margins of the region to 2,200 feet at the base of the Cap Rock
Escarpment on the region’s western edges (Jordan et al. 1984). Climatic conditions in Nolan County are
semi-arid with long, hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is heaviest in the spring and fall, with
roughly 23 inches of annual rainfall. Surrounding the project area, land use consists of pasture and ranch
land.
GEOLOGY
The CR 143 study area is underlain by Quaternary (Holocene) Alluvium and the Permian-age Whitehorse
Sandstone and Cloud Chief Gypsum, undivided. The alluvium consists of floodplain and low terrace
deposits adjacent to the channel, while the interbedded Permian deposits of sandstone, gypsum, sand, and
dolomite comprise the surrounding uplands (Barnes 1974). Soils mapped in the project area are identified
as Colorado loam, frequently flooded immediately adjacent to the creek, and Quinlan loam, 1 to 5 percent
slopes, on the nearby uplands (Lowther 1981). Colorado loam, frequently flooded consists of deep loam
formed in calcareous loamy alluvium on bottomlands (Lowther 1981:64). Adjacent to the Colorado soils
is Quinlan loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes, which consists of shallow, loamy upland soils that formed in situ
from red-bed sandstone (Lowther 1981:70). Quaternary alluvium found along local and regional
drainages has consistently been shown to contain buried cultural deposits.
SOILS
Soils in the project area consist of Colorado soils, frequently flooded, which are deep, nearly level loamy
soils formed on benches above creek channels in calcareous loamy alluvial sediment. Clairemont silty
clay loam is mapped west of the project area and is described as a deep, nearly level loamy soil on
bottomlands astride creek channels formed in calcareous alluvium. Just east of, and adjacent to, the APE
is an area of Owens-Badland complex, 3 to 12 percent slopes. The Owens series consists of clayey,
sloping upland soils that formed in clayey shale, while Badland consists of exposed redbed shaly clay on
or below escarpments. The Owens-Badland complex, 3 to 12 percent slopes, is found on steep knolls,
escarpments, and ridges (Conner 1976).
VEGETATION
Nolan County lies in the Kansan biotic province (Blair 1950). Vegetation is a mixed-grass plain
dominated by little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and
western wheatgrass (Agropyron Smithii). A mesquite-grass association is common and dominated by
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), with various species of grama (Bouteloua spp.), three-awn (Aristida
spp.) and broomweed (Gutierrezia texana). Shorter grass species include buffalograss (Buchloe
dactyloides) and various grama grasses. The bridge location also supports deciduous riparian species
dominated by oak, (Quercus spp.) American elm (Ulmus americana) and hackberry (Celtis occidentalis).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of data available online on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and records at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) was conducted to determine the presence of any previously
recorded sites or previous project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of the project area. That review
revealed that there are no previously recorded sites or project area within the search area.

METHODS
The intensive archeological survey on CR 143 at Seale Creek involved surface and subsurface
investigations of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of
any discovered cultural resources. Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the
guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and
Guidelines (NPS 1983). Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA
among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project area by two
archeologists systematically examining the ground surface for cultural remains. Subsurface investigations
involved limited backhoe trenching, the excavation of shovel tests and shovel columns, and the inspection
of road cut profiles along CR 143 to prospect for buried cultural materials. Shovel tests and columns were
at least 30 to 40 centimeters in width and excavated with a square-head shovel to a depth of 100
centimeters or more below ground surface or until soil characteristics or bedrock prohibit further
excavation. All sediments removed from shovel tests and shovel columns were screened through ¼-inch
wire mesh. All appropriate shovel data was recorded on Blanton & Associates shovel test and shovel
column forms and plotted with hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receivers.
Backhoe trenching was limited as the backhoe operator was concerned that: 1) because of the narrow
ROW, the backhoe and backfill would have been forced to occupy the road during excavations,
2) excavations would have undercut and impacted the existing fill section and road base, and (3 the local
utility representative indicated there was an unmarked buried telephone cable on the west side of the
ROW, the exact location of which was unknown.
Excavated backhoe trenches were approximately 5 meters (16.4 feet) long, 1.0 meters (3.3 feet) wide, and
1.5 meters (4.9 feet) deep. Following excavations, the archeologists cleaned and examined trench walls to
locate any in situ artifacts, cultural features, or soil anomalies in trench profiles. Stratigraphic units in
each trench were recorded and described in detail and a photographic record made. If any buried cultural
material is identified, a 30-x-30-centimeter shovel test column will be excavated in the trench with a
square-head shovel. All sediments removed from the columns will be screened through ¼-inch wire mesh
and all appropriate data was recorded on a Blanton & Associates geologic profile form. Backhoe trench
locations were plotted with hand-held GPS receivers. All field investigations were thoroughly
photographed with digital cameras.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Archeological investigations at Seale Creek indicated that the existing CR 143 ROW is extremely narrow
and disturbed by erosion, buried utilities, and roadway construction and maintenance. In the northeast,
northwest and southwest quadrants of the project area, the distance between the ROW boundary fence and
the edge of the pavement is about 12 feet, while in the southeast quadrant the width is only eight to 10
feet (Figure 4). According to the local utility representative, there was an unmarked buried telephone
cable paralleling the west side of the road in the northwest and southwest quadrants of the APE.
Surface investigations within the APE revealed no prehistoric or historic cultural resources, only modern
roadside debris and trash. Subsurface investigations at Seale Creek consisted of the excavation of one
backhoe trench, two shovel tests, and two shovel columns (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). Because of the unmarked
buried telecommunication cable west of the roadway and the very narrow ROW, subsurface
investigations in the northwest and southwest quadrants of the APE involved the preparation of roadcut
profiles and shovel columns, while excavations were possible in the northeast and southeast quadrants.
Backhoe Trench 1 was excavated north of Seale Creek and contained sand and clay construction fill with
roadbed gravel overlying sandy loam and sandy clay loam to a maximum depth of 191 centimeters below
ground surface (Figure 6; see Figures 5.1 and 5.2). Three stratigraphic zones (I–III) were identified during
trench examinations. Zone I (0 to 36 centimeters below ground surface) consisted of alternating bands of
brownish dry, firm, and compacted clayey construction fill with roadbed gravels throughout. Inclusions
consisted of one fragment of barbed wire and several plastic fragments. The lower boundary was clear
and smooth. Zone II extended from 36 to 87 centimeters below ground surface and consisted of dry and
firm strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sand loam with a weak granular structure. Inclusions included common,
distinct, yellowish red mottles and 3 to 4 millimeter size pea gravels. The lower boundary was gradual
and smooth. Zone III extended from 87 to 191 centimeters below ground surface and consisted of
massive dry, very firm brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam with a blocky structure. This zone contained
few faint and fine brown (7.5YR 5/4) mottles and abundant calcium carbonate flecks and filaments. Zone
III terminated at the floor of the trench so the lower boundary was not observed.
Shovel Tests 1 and 2 were excavated in the southeast quadrant of the APE (see Figures 5.1 and 5.2).
Shovel Test 1 extended to 103 centimeters below ground surface and exhibited 17 centimeters (0 to
17 centimeters) of brownish dry, firm, and compacted sand and clay construction fill with road gravels
overlying massive, dry, and firm reddish brown sandy loam alluvium from 17 to 103 centimeters below
ground surface. Shovel Test 2 was located south of Shovel Test 1 and contained construction fill
overlying sandy loam alluvium. Between 0 and 22 centimeters below ground surface, Shovel Test 2
consisted of very dry and hard construction fill with gravels and broken limestone rock fragments. From
22 to 46 centimeters was dry and extremely firm reddish brown sandy loam truncated by road
construction cut and fill activities. Below the truncated zone, from 46 to 78 centimeters below ground
surface, Shovel Test 2 exhibited dry and firm reddish brown sandy loam with water worn gravels
appearing at the bottom of the level. The final stratum in Shovel Test 2 consisted of a virtually
impenetrable deposit of water worn gravel between 78 and 83 centimeters, at which depth excavations
were halted. No cultural materials were discovered within the alluvial deposit.

The excavation of two shovel columns (Shovel Columns 1 and 2) west of the roadway revealed massive
partially intact to intact alluvial deposits (see Figures 5.1 and 5.2). Shovel Column 1 was located in the
northwest quadrant of the APE near the bridge embankment and consisted of 30-centimeter thick strata of
dry and firm to very firm dark yellowish brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam with occasional water worn
gravels alternating with thin (10 centimeters) bands of yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy loam containing
decayed organics and many worm casts to a maximum depth of 230 centimeters below ground surface
(Figure 7). The lower boundaries between various strata in Shovel Column 1 were clear and smooth.
However, the lower boundary of the deepest stratum, which terminated at the creek bed at a depth of
230 centimeters, was not observed. In the southeast quadrant of the APE, Shovel Column 2 extended to a
maximum depth of 200 centimeters below ground surface and exhibited stratigraphy similar to that
observed in SC 1 (see Figure 7).
Profiles 1 and 2 were prepared along the CR 143 road cut in, respectively, the northwest and southwest
quadrants of the APE. Both consisted of massive yellowish red (5YR 5/6) dry and firm sandy loam
alluvium from 0 to 140 centimeters below ground surface (Figure 8). Occasional golf ball size water worn
gravels were observed throughout. No lower boundary was observed at depth in either profile. In general,
investigations suggested that the more intact soils were located immediately adjacent to the bridge and
near the northern and southern termini of the APE. No archeological materials were discovered in the
profiles.

The intensive survey on CR 143 at Seale Creek discovered no cultural resources within the APE. Given
the results of the surface and subsurface investigations, as well as the narrow, disturbed conditions
throughout the APE resulting from a buried telephone cable, erosion, and highway cut and fill
construction, it is unlikely that any intact cultural resources would be impacted within the APE by the
planned bridge replacement and associated roadway improvements.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive survey efforts found no cultural resources within the existing CR 143 ROW at Seale Creek.
Shovel testing, backhoe trenching and the preparation of shovel columns and road cut profiles revealed
sandy and clayey construction fill overlying truncated alluvium or massive partially intact to intact
alluvial deposits. West of the roadway, the existing ROW contains soils disturbed by an unmarked buried
telephone cable, erosion, and highway cut and fill construction. East of the roadway, ROW conditions
were similar except there was no buried utility.
Given the results of the survey and the soil conditions throughout the project area, it is the opinion of
Blanton & Associates that there is little to no potential for the APE to contain intact buried prehistoric
deposits or intact historic cultural resources. Therefore, Blanton & Associates recommends that, because
the project would impact no prehistoric or historic cultural resources that could contribute new or
important information to our understanding of regional or local prehistory and history, construction
should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional cultural resource investigations.
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional ROW for the proposed construction or for future
construction projects, then additional cultural resource investigations are recommended for those areas. In
the event that previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the
immediate area would cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental
discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
