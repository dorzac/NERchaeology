CVAS Annual Archeological Fair
Huge Success
Larry Riemenschneider

Today as I sit and reflect on the events
of yesterday, “Yesteryears Revisited”, all I
can say is what a success. The weather was
great and the approximately 1500 people attending made for a very exciting day.
A good feeling came over me as I
walked through the buildings during the day
and saw the many people (both young and
old) participating in the exhibits, demonstrations and activities. To see children excited
about finding artifacts in the mock excavation or eating hot dogs and telling their parents about all they had done makes all of
our efforts worth the time spent.
I am very pleased with the results.
You, the participants who volunteered your
time, are to be commended for providing
quality exhibits, demonstrations and handson activities. A very special thanks to those
who helped set up and closed the fair.
Without all of the time and effort that everyone devoted to this event, it would not have
been the success that it was.

I would like to thank all of you for participating
in this year’s Archeology Fair and providing archeological and historical information to the
public. I feel that the CVAS has met one of its
most important goals, helping the people of the
Concho Valley better understand the importance
of preserving our heritage. Just think, your exhibit, demonstration or what you had to say may
have sparked an interest in someone that may
encourage him or her to actively pursue a career
in archeology, anthropology, or other fields devoted to history.
Thank you again for your time, energy and
expertise. The CVAS looks forward to your participation in Yesteryears Revisited, 2008.

Rattlesnake Shelter Pictograph Tour

October 25-28, 2007
(coincides with the RAF Rendezvous Oct 26-28)

Drawing by Forrest Kirkland from The Rock Art of Texas Indians

Sign Up Sign up sheets for tours will be in the interpretive center/office at Seminole Canyon State Park. Meet
Texas Tech representative at the Seminole Canyon Center at 8 AM for a morning tour, or 1 PM for an afternoon
tour. Sign 2 liability release forms and make $25 donation ($5 for students) (cash or check payable to Texas
Tech University).
Travel Participants are responsible for their own transportation. Carpooling is encouraged to reduce the number
of vehicles involved as much as possible. Tours will depart at 8:30 AM and 1:30 PM from the Seminole
Canyon Center parking lot. If you are not with the guided group, you will not be able to get in.
Drive to Langtry on Hwy. 90 (ca. 20 miles). From Langtry, there is a short drive west on Hwy. 90. We will then
enter a private ranch through a locked gate and travel about 3.5 miles on a rough gravel road. Ranch road is slow
and dusty, but 4-wheel is not required. However, your vehicle needs to have high clearance. The group should
be back at Seminole Canyon in about 3 hours.
Difficulty The hike to Rattlesnake Shelter is moderately strenuous. The round- trip walking distance is
about 1 mile involving going into and coming out of the canyon on unimproved trails. We will be in a remote
location where response to serious injuries and medical emergencies will be difficult.
Clothing Sturdy hiking boots, long pants, and a hat are recommended.
Restrooms The closest public restrooms are at the Judge Roy Bean Center in Langtry.
Bring A quart or two of drinking water, camera, walking stick, bug repellent, etc.
Don't Bring Firearms. Pets. Alcohol.

Friends and colleagues: Legendary personages are not always purely mythological or
simply the stuff of Hollywood movies: sometimes they are very real. Such is the case
with the pirate Blackbeard, the subject of
Queen Anne's Revenge Overview, the latest
video feature on our nonprofit streamingmedia Web site, The Archaeology Channel
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org).
Blackbeard, the most notorious pirate in the
history of seafaring, met his end on the
North Carolina coast in 1718. In 1996, divers searching for shipwrecks discovered a
room-sized mound of cannons, anchors,
and ballast stones that state underwater archaeologists agreed quite possibly was the
remains of Blackbeard's flagship, Queen
Anne's Revenge, lost at that location in
1718. This video highlights recent underwater excavations conducted at the site,
representing one of the most ambitious archaeological assessments of a North Carolina shipwreck. Through the artifacts recovered from that site, Blackbeard steps out
from the shadows of the past and becomes
a tangible historical figure.
This and other programs are available on
