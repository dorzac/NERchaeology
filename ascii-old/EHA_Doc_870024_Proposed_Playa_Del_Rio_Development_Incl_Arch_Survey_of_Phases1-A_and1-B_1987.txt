INTRODUCTION
The Playa de! Rio project area (Figure 1-1) consists of approximately

lZ,500 acres (ac) of land in Cameron County, Texas, located along the north bank of
the Rio Grande, extending inland from the Gulf of Mexico for a distance of 13 miles
(Zl kilometers (km)) and extending north of the river along the coastline for a

!

distance of approximately 8 miles (13 km). Also included within the project area is
a large portion of Brazos Island.

Development of this area will include low-,

medium-, and high-density residential sites; retail, office, commercial and convention space; marinas; golf courses; amenities; open space; schools; and utility sites.
This study was performed in compliance with the following Federal
legislation:

915, 4Z U.S.C. 4321), 1970
An archaeological and historical assessment of the Playa de! Rio project
area was conducted by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (EH&A).

Early in .the

project planning process (summer of 1984), a literature search involving a review of
all literature pertaining to the prehistory and history of the area was begun and a
records search for known sites was accomplished.

A field reconnaissance and

evaluation of all previously-Tecorded prehistoric and historic sites known to exist in
the project area was conducted in March and April 1987. In addition, two tracts of
land (Phase I-A and Phase I-B) (Figure 1-Z) proposed for development during Phase I
of the Playa de! Rio project were intensiv.;ly surveyed in an attempt to locate any
archaeological remains which may be present within these areas.

A total of 10 archaeological/historical sites have been recorded within
the project area (figures A-1 and A-Z; see Appendix A), including two prehistoric
sites, seven historic sites, and one of unknown origin (41 CFS). An additional historic
site (41 CFlZ.7), the former location of Del Mar, a 1930s resort community on Brazos
Island, is included in this discussion. Although not located within the project· area, a
road associated with the project is proposed to cross Brazos Island near the vicinity
of this site. The sites located within the project area include: two prehistoric sites
which were recorded by A. E. Anderson in the 1930s (these sites, labeled S8.4 E and
S8.6 by Anderson, have never been assigned a Smithsonian Trinomial System site
number as more recent investigators have not been able to relocate them); 41 CF4,
Brazos Santiago Depot, a nineteenth-century military encampment, supply depot and
port of entry on the north end of Brazos Island; 41 CFS, reported to be a multiple
human burial site of unknown temporal affiliation recorded in the sand dunes near
the mouth of the Rio Grande; 41 CF6, a mid-nineteenth-century site, located near
the river at Tarpon Bend, believed to be the remains of Shin's Ferry; 41 CF7, the
former townsite of Clarksville (1847 to 1874) at the mouth of the river; 41 CF9, a
nineteenth-century site located on Loma de la Estrella; 41 CFS!, a supposed and
apparently destroyed nineteenth-century

In addition to the designated sites mentioned above, there is a possibility

that remains from at least four other historic sites, known from nineteenth century
maps and historic literature, may exist within the project area.

These include:

1) Camp Belknap, a temporary U.S. military encampment on Loma de la Estrella
during the Mexican War; Z) White Ranch, a major point of commerce during the era
of river steamboats on the Rio Grande; 3) Miguel's, an unidentified historic site
shown on the north bank of the Rio Grande in an 18S4 map of the river; and 4) the
wreck of the steamboat Camargo which was sunk at the White Ranch landing in
1867.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND

The prehistory of the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas and Tamaulipas
is poorly understood.

Archaeological investigations have primarily been limited to

surface collections by professional and amateur archaeologists.

To date, no

extensive controlled excavations have been undertaken in the area and, with the
exception of occasionally-found burials, definable subsurface components and/or
stratigraphy are only rarely found south from Baffin Bay to the Rio Grande,

I
I

The earliest and most extensive work in the area is that of A. E.
Anderson. From 1908 to 1940, Anderson, a civil engineer by training, collected and
kept accurate records on data from almost 400 sites in Cameron County and
adjacent parts of Tamaulipas, Mexico.

In l 93Z, he published a brief description of

his artifacts from the Brownsville area (Anderson, 193Z:Z9-31),

Artifacts from his

collection are generally typical of cultural material. found on the Lower Rio Grande
Delta and his collection reflects the predominance of a shellworking industry that
has frequently been called the outstanding characteristic of the area by later
investigators. Many professional archaeologists have relied heavily on the Anderson
Collection as a supplement to their own survey data in making interregional
comparisons and in establishing chronological schemes (Sayles, 1935:40-41; Jackson,
1940:99-137; Campbell, 1947:40-75; MacNeish, 1947:1-15; Prewitt, 1974:55-65) •.

The

first

widely-accepted

terminology

for Texas archaeology

was

defined with the publication of An Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology
(Suhm et al., 1954).

A chronology based on four broad divisions, called stages, was

established, consisting of the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Nee-American (referred to here
as Late Prehistoric, after Hester and Parker (1970)), and Historic stages. Information for three of the four stages in the Lower Rio Grande Valley area is lacking, but

I

L

relevant data for most of these unknown time periods is available in varying degrees
from surrounding areas.

The earliest evidence of man in the Americas is generally accepted as

Fl

I

being represented by the Paleo-Indian stage, and includes materials predating 5000
to 6000 B. C.

During Paleo-Indian times, great expanses of land were inundated by

the sea from the melting of the glacial masses at the end of the Pleistocene.

The

final rise .in sea level began about 18,000 years ago with the present coastline being
achieved some 3,000 years ago (Brown et al., 1976:21).

No Paleo-Indian sites have

been found in the immediate project area. Anderson's collection contains one Clovis
point base, an isolated find reportedly found near the Laguna Atascosa National

r

I

Wildlife Refuge.

W. A. Price saw mammoth bones eroding in the same vicinity in

later years (Suhm et al., 1954 :118, 121).

Other area researchers (Prewitt, 1987)

report that they have not identified any positive evidence of Paleo-Indian remains in
the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

It should be pointed out, however, that the barrier

island and riverine systems of the Lower Rio Grande Valley are very dynamic
environmen.ts (e.g., Morton and Pieper, 1975); thus, preservation of sites dating to
the P.aleo-lndian period would not necessarily be expected'.

I.I

In the greater south Texas and northeast Mexico area, several PaleoIndian sites have been reported, and in a few cases, excavated.

At the Falcon

Reservoir, about 150 miles (240 km) west"'llorthwest of the project area, the Evans

1,

site on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande yielded an artifact possibly associated with
extinct megafauna (Cason, 1952:243). On the other side of the Rio Grande, Mexican
archaeologists found flint debitage and an artifact eroding out of a mammoth
locality (Kreiger, n.d.:8).

A Plainview point was found at another of the Falcon

Reservoir sites by Mexican archaeologists (Arguedas R. de la Borbolla and Aveleyra
Arroyo de Anda, 1953:392-393).

In Starr County, approximately 93 miles (150 km)

to the northwest,

excavations by Weir 0956:59-78) and Newton (1968) isolated a Paleo-Indian com-

ponent at the La Perdida site, as identified by Plainview, Meserve, Angostura,
Scottsbluff, and Clovis projectile points. Abundant Archaic material was also found •.
North of Corpus Christi, approximately 150 miles (250 km) from the

[_;

project area, Clovis, Folsom, and other early projectile point types were found in

[I

association with mammoth, mastodon, horse, bison, and glyptodon bones at the

r'

Buckner Ranch Site in Bee County (Sellards, 1940:1627-1657).

Large quantities of

late Paleo-lndian points have also been found slightly further north on San Miguel
Creek in Atascosa and McMullen counties (Hester, 1968:147-162).

As the climate changed and big game animals died out, there was a

!I

I

transition into the Archaic Stage.

Recognized Archaic dart .points in the Anderson

collection indicate the presence of Archaic peoples in the area; however, no Archaic sites on the lower Texas coast have ever been excavated.

~-'

South of the project area, pertinent information, including a chronology
for the Archaic in Tamaulipas, was published by MacNeish (1958) after three seasons
of survey and excavation.

Tamaulipas.

They are, from earliest to latest, the Nogales, R~pelo, and Abasolo

complexes, and span the time period from 5000 B.C. to A.D. 100. He made comparisons to Archaic materials from the Falcon Reservoir where the Archaic Falcon
focus was defined with an estimated temporal span of approximately 5000 B.C. to
A.D. 500 or 1000 (Suhm et al., 1954:136-142).
Recent unpublished investigations in south Texas, in an area approximately 150 miles (250 km) north of the project area, include the excavation of a
large Archaic cemetery named Loma Sandia, 41LK28, in Live Oak County (Taylor
and Highley, in preparation).

Dart points, stone pipes, shell ornaments, and deer

antlers are among the grave goods found with some of these burials.

data on the Archaic of interior south Texas (Hester, 1980:61).
In the Coastal Bend or central section of the Texas coast above

Brownsville, the Aransas Focus of the Archaic stage has been described (Campbell,
1947:40-75, 1958:145-175; Corbin, 1974:Z9-54).

North of Corpus Christi, these

Archaic and later peoples left behind mound-like midden accumulations of oyster,
clam, conch, and mussel shells.
middens are absent.

.,

I
I

Between Corpus Christi and Brownsville, shell

Coastal peoples from the Archaic and Late Prehistoric stages

chose clay dunes (locally called lomas) most frequently as locales for habitation and
burial (Campbell, 1958:154-155), such clay dunes extending from St. Charles Bay in
Aransas County to as far south as the Rio Soto la Marina in central Tamaulipas. No
extensive excavations have ever been conducted on any of these Joma sites in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley area.

Farther north, however, on Oso Creek in Nueces

County, the Kirchmeyer site, 41NU11, has been tested (Hester, 1980:63).
Survey work in Willacy and Hidalgo counties, west and north of Cameron
County, has yielded dart points which may be of Archaic age ( Mallouf et al.,
1977 :193). However, work at the Falcon Reservoir showed that some of these types
continue into the Late Prehistoric (Suhm and Jelks, 196Z:Z49). Other limited survey
work, some of which has occurred in the actual project area, has examined locations

I'

where archaeological materials, including those of Archaic age, are generally found
(Prewitt, 1974:58-59). Prewitt noted that sites most frequently occur on clay dunes,
particularly where these face Jagunas and inland lakes; on resacas; and on the
barrier islands. Additional studies conducted in Hidalgo and Willacy counties include
those of Prewitt and Day (1981) and Prewitt and Mercado-Allinger (1983).

The Late Prehistoric stage (Hester and Parker, 1970 :1-Z3), termed NeoAmerican by Suhm,

Krieger,

and Jelks (1954:18-ZO),

follows the Archaic at

approximately A.D. 1000 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The stage is most clearly
marked by the replacement of dart points by arrowpoints in the artifact inventory.

Z-4

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

_\!though, in many areas of Texas, ceramics appear on archaeological sites during
this stage, ceramics are relatively scarce in the Lower Rio Grande Valley; the entire
Anderson collection contains only about a hundred specimens.

Fl
I
l

The bulk of our knowledge of the archaeology of the lower Texas coast is
from the Late Prehistoric. Mac Neish (1958 :!86-19Z) has defined two closely-related
complexes, the Brownsville and Barri!, for the Lower Rio Grande delta.

Common to

both complexes are shell disks, pierced shell disk beads, plugs made from a
columella which are round in cross section, rectangular conch shell pendants,
mollusc shell scrapers, and Starr, Fresnos, and Matamoros projectile points. Intrusive pottery of Huastec origin from southern Tamaulipas appears in occupation sites
and in burials (Anderson, 193Z:Z9-31; Mason, 1935:Z9-46; MacNeish, 1947:7).

[]

The Barri! Complex is thought to be slightly earlier than the Brownsville
Complex, and is almost entirely restricted to the south side of the Rio Grande.
Artifacts diagnostic of the Barri! Complex are antler perforators; pitted stone
anvils; Jong, narrow, rectangular conch shell pendants; chipped pebble hammerstones; tubular beads made. from a co!umel!a; co!umella projectile points; bone
points;

split-bone

awls;

round

shell pendants; and

triangular shell pendants

(MacNeish, 1958:189).

f

h

I·

Brownsville Complex sites occur almost exclusively in Cameron C.ounty,
Texas.

Pierced whole conch shells, small snail shell beads, conical pumice pipes,

bivalve beads, Marginella beads, conch shell fishhooks, Cameron projectile points,
shell plugs with rectangular cross sections, columella gouges, and chipped, pin-like
drills are diagnostic of this complex (MacNeish, 1958:189).

Brownsville Complex burials have been founa at the Floyd Morris site
(Collins, Hester and Weir, 1969:199-146) in Cameron County and at the Ayala site in
Hidalgo County (Campbell and Frizzell, 1949:63-7Z).

BrownsviJ!e Complex burials

are characteristically flexed, bundled, or cremated, and sometimes covered with red

Z-5

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

ocher. Large amounts of grave goods, including bone and shell beads, shell tinlders,
perforated canine teeth, and altered human bones often occur.
Cultural materials from the Brownsville Complex are similar to those

Fl

north in the vicinity of Baffin Bay, where the Late Prehistoric Rockport Focus has
its southern limits.

Triangular arrowpoints, scrapers, conch shell gouges, and some

shell ornaments appear in both areas. Some Rockport pottery has also been found in

r

Brownsville Complex sites.
South of the Brownsville and Barri! complexes in Tamaulipas, MacNeish
(1958 :186) defined three other complexes:

the Catan, Panuco, and Las Flores.

These are . all related and more or less contemporaneous to the Brownsville and
Barri! complexes.

All of these complexes, along with the Mier Focus of southwest

Texas, share similar projectile point types (MacNeish, 1958:186).

The Catan

Complex, which is located inland south of the Barri!, is viewed as similar to the

,

1--i
' .

I

Barri! Complex, but lacks its artifact density. The Catan is almost identical to the
Mier Focus, except for the lack of Huastec trade pottery in the Mier Focus.
The Panuco and Las Flores complexes are Huastec sites that occur in

1-1

L

extreme southern interior Tamaulipas.

On the coast, these complexes cover the

south coast and extend northward to approximately the Rio Soto la Marina,
approximately ZSS miles (408 km) south of the P!aya de! Rio project area.

These

sites consist of shell mounds· and, in some cases, include ball courts and earthen
mounds. These complexes are the origin of the Huastecan pottery that occurs in the.
Brownsville area.

!,
I

This pottery may have been traded for items produced by the

Brownsville and Barri! peoples. The Panuco Complex and Las Flores Complex sites
also contain trade items from central Texas to the north and central Veracruz to the
sou th.

The Panuco arid Las Flores complexes may be viewed as the northeastern-

most extension of the agriculturally-based complex society of Meso-America.

Z-6

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

L

The Panuco and Las Flores complexes also represent the northern
extension of the Huastec language.

This language is from the Mayan linguistic

family. which is found in the southern Mexican states of Chiapas, Campeche,
Yucatan, Quintana Roo, and in adjacent Guatemala and Belize.

The Spanish explorers found Indians of the final stage, Historic Indians,
speaking the Coahuiltecan language in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico
north of the Huastec area. The Coahuiltecan language is similar to the Karankawan,
which was spoken by coastal peoples north of Corpus Christi up to the west side of
Galveston Bay (Swanton, 1940:144).

From Corpus Christi, the Coahuiltecan area

extended northwestward to San Antonio, westward to just below the point where the
Pecos River empties into the Rio Grande, and southward into Nuevo Leon, northeast
Coahuila, northern San Luis Potosi, northeast Zacatecas, and northern Tamaulipas
(Newcomb, 1961 :29-30).

Coahuiltecan peoples are linguistically related to the

HISTORlC BACKGROUND
The Lower Rio Grande Valley, with its rich and diverse history, has long

played a pivotal role in the history of the vast territories that extend on either side
of the river.

Because of its strategic location at the mouth of one of the great

waterways of North America, the region has been an important center of activity
since the sixteenth century.

Z.Z.1

Spanish Exploration and Early Settlement

The Spanish are recognized as the first nation to claim territory that
'encompasses the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

Alonso Alvarez de Piileada is believed

. by many to have been the first European to reach the mouth of the river, arriving in

1519 (Scott, 1937:Z; Stambaugh and Stambaugh,

1954:Z).

Pmeada,

who was

commissioned to map and explore the Gulf of Mexico by Francisco de Garay,
Governor of Jamaica, discovered a large river with a grove of palm trees at its
delta.

He subsequently named this waterway Rio de las Palmas (Clark and Scott,

1955). Historians do not agree as to which ·river Pmeada actually discovered. Some
maintain that it was the Rio Grande (Webb, 195Z Il:474), while others believe it was
the Rio Soto la Marina in Tamaulipas, Mexico (Hill, 19Z6:14). Weddle (1985:104-105)
supports the latter contention, pointing out that the Rio Soto la Marina was known
until the mid-eighteenth century as the Rio de las Palmas, while one of its southern
tributaries continues under that name today.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding

the exact location of Rio de las Palmas, Pmeada's efforts spurred further explora-

u

tion of territory in the region.
Jn 1520, a year after Pmeada's trip, Garay sent an expedition Jed by

Diego de Camargo to colonize the territory.

Although unsuccessful because of

conflicts with native tribes in the area, this effort demonstrated the strong desire of

I
I

the Spanish to consolidate their claims to the region.

Jn addition, Camargo is

credited with naming the narrow waterway that extends between Brazos and Padre

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

R

islands.

He called this pass Brazos de San Iago, in honor of Saint James Day

(Alperin, 1977 :137). A. A. Champion, a local historian, notes that Iago is the ancient.
form of Diego which, translitted into English, is James.

In subsequent years, the

name evolved into Brazos Santiago, by which it is known today (Washington, 1979).
Several other attempts were made by the. Spanish to explore and settle
the Lower Rio Grande Valley during the sixteenth century, including expeditions led
by Gonzalo de Ocampo in 1523, Sancho de Ca'iiiedo in 1528 and Pedro de Alverado in
1535; however, no permanent settlements were established.

After these efforts,

Spanish activity was severely curtailed and no serious attempts were made to
colonize the Lower Rio Grande Valley until the mid-eighteenth century.
Spanish activity during the intervening ZOO years was primarily military

[

in nature, as efforts were made to locate and counter expeditions of, or settlements
established by, other European nations.

Such intrusions were regarded as direct

threats to Spanish sovereignty and, despite an occasional lack of concrete evidence
for their existence, were always taken seriously. In 1638, for example, rumors of a
Dutch invasion at the mouth of the Rio Grande prompted the Spanish to send Jacinto

1-!

L

Garcia de Sepulveda and his men to find these intruders. None, however, were found
(Stambaugh and Stambaugh, 1954:21; Ruecking, 1955:55).

In 1685, Alonso de Leon

led the first of several expeditions assigned to locate Fort Saint Louis which had
been established near Lavaca Bay by the Frenchman Rene Robert Cavalier, Sieure
de La Salle.

De Leon's search eventually took him throughout the southern Texas

coastal areas and he is believed to have crossed the Arroyo Colorado in midCameron County.

De Leon eventually discovered the fort, abandoned (Stambaugh

and Stambaugh, 1954:23; Webb, 1952 1:483-484).

I
t

By

the

mid-eighteenth

century,

Spanish

authorities

demonstrated

renewed interest in settling land that inc)uded the Lower Rio Grande valley, as well
as much of modern-day south Texas and northern Mexico.

Although Spain had

retained control of this territory, which was known as Nuevo Santande.lfor over

200 years, very little was known about its land, resources and vegetation.

R

on September 3, 1746, Jose de Escandon was made lieutenant of the viceroy of Sena

Plans

were made to inspect the region between Tampico and the San Antonio River and,
Mexicano and conquistador and governor of the province of Nuevo Santande~ This -

,,

appointment marked the beginning of Escand'on's 23-year commitment,. to the

Fi

colonization of these lands and proved to be a turning point in the development of
the Lower Rio Grande Valley. In 1747, Escanden dispatched four expeditions to the

I'

region and personally led one that took him and his party to the Rio Grande and
nearby environs.

Captain Joaquin de Orobio Bazterra, commander at Presidio La

Bahia de! Espiritu Santo, led another expedition that explored territory between the
Nueces River and the Rio Grande. These and the other parties met near the mouth

I

r

of the river (Bolton, 1962:292-293; Hili, 1926:58-59).
With the knowledge acquired from these expeditions, Escanden instigated
a

colonization policy

that

resulted

in

the

establishment

of 23 settlements.

Departing from traditional Spanish practice which relied heavily upon a strong
military presence, EscandOn, as Bolton writes, "was a firm believer in the superiority
of civil settlements and missions as a. means of subduing the natives and of holding
the country against foreign aggression" (1962:292).

Towns founded by EscandOn

were, therefore, dependent primarily upon civil defenses.

L

None of his settlements

were located in the project area; the closest was Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de
Reynos (now known as Reynosa) on the south bank of the Rio Grande, about 81 miles
(130 km) from the mouth.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, organized settlement began
to expand toward the Gulf of Mexico.

In 1765, San Juan de 'los Esteros, a small

ranching village populated by residents of Reynosa, was established about 22 miles
(35 km) from the mouth of the river. Initially, the settlement struggled to survive,
but in 1795, a large influx of colonists from Nuevo Leon assured its prosperity.

A

year later, it was renamed Nuestra Senora de! Refugio; following Mexican independence from Spain, its name was changed again, this time to Matamoros,' in honor of a

Mexican Jurisdiction and Texas Independence

Mexican independence from Spain in 1823 contributed to the development of the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

In 1829, the first land grant issued in the

project area was awarded by the newly created state of Tamaulipas (formerly Nueva
Santandes) to Jose Ygnacio de Trevmo (Cameron County Deed Records Volume G,
pages 260-263), Encompassing six leagues, the grant included the mouth of the Rio
Grande and utilized the meandering river as its .southern boundary (Figure 2-1).
Unfortunately, little is known of Trevmo and his family, but he is c.redited with the

IJ
H
'

establishment of the San Martili Ranch, whose headquarters were located near the
Rio Grande at the western end of the grant (Anonymous, 1974:2; Emory, 1857:59).

Although exact figures are not available, Mexicans were the prevalent
cultural group in the region. Like Trevmo, most of these settlers were ranchers, as
the land and the semi-arid conditions proved particularly well-suited for ranching.
As trade increased and Matamoros grew, many Americans and Europeans came
seeking economic opportunities.

Unlike the Mexicans, however, these individuals

were, for the most part, merchants (Graf, 1942:451). charles Stillman, a native of
Connecticut, was one such individual and he later became a dominant force in the
economic development of the region.

He settled in Matamoros in February 1828

and, along with his father, operated a profitable mercantile business.

I

He later

joined forces with Mifflin Kenedy and Richard King in a steamship operation that
transported goods from the mouth of the Rio Grande to Matamoros during the midnineteenth century (Webb, 1952 Il:673).

Perhaps the most significant development during this period was the
establishment of a sea port in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in 1823. Prior to this,

Vera Cruz had served as Spain's sole open port in Mexico which made the
transporting of goods to more remote areas in the colony difficult, expensive and
time consuming. With the opening of a port in Matamoros, however, trade with the
rich hinterlands of northern Mexico was more accessible. Martin de Leon, who later

R

founded the town of Victoria, Texas, initiated commercial shipping to the Rio
Grande region when he chartered a schooner in New Orleans that sailed to Brazos
Santiago.

From there, the goods were transported overland to Matamoros for

distribution (EH&A, 1981:16).

I

Another important event of the era was the inauguration of steamship

t.

service along the river.

I

his steamer Ariel from

!

Henry Austin, a cousin of Stephen F. Austin, arrived with
New York on June Z9, 18Z9.

Despite Austin's grand

intentions, the operation of the steamboat was not profitable.

The difficulty of

navigation on the river and the lack of cooperation and participation among Mexican
merchants were prime factors for its abandonment in September 1830. Austin then
took the vessel to the Brazos River (Graf, 194Z:6Z-66).

H
' .

Although its impact on

commercial trade was hardly noticable, the arrival of Austin's steamboat ushered in
an era that gained considerable significance in subsequent decades.

Texas' struggle for independence, for the most part, bypassed the Lower
Rio Grande Valley, as most military and political events took place farther north.
Following the war's conclusion, 4,000 soldiers of Santa Anna's defeated army
converged on Matamoros and depleted much of the available food supplies.

Com-

merce and trade in the town and nearby areas diminished with this sudden influx, hut
its effects were only temporary.

Soon, the economy rebounded and residents went

on about their business (Thompson, 1965 :17 -18).

After the ·Republic of Texas was officially formed and was truly
independent of Mexico, territory between the Rio Grande and. Nueces River was
claimed by both countries.

The inability of each government to effectively control

or exert much influence in this area left many residents vulnerable to attack by

Z-13

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

[
Indians and roaming bands of "soldiers" of both countries.

Another event that

increased tensions occurred in 1839 when Francisco Viadaurri and others declared
that a new nation, the Republic of the Rio Grande, was being formed from the
Mexican states of Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua, Coahuila and Tamaulipas, including the

The Mexican War and the Advent of the Steamers

When Texas was annexed by

I

Unlike the Texas war for

the

United States in 1845,

Mexico

reaffirmed its claim to territory between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande.
President James K. Polk, meanwhile, sent General Zachary Taylor and 1,500 men to
Corpus Christi to assert the United State's position that the Rio Grande served as
the border.

H
i

I;
j

In February 1846, Taylor and his troops marched southward, reaching

the north bank of the Rio Grande in the following month.

He ordered his men to

construct a garrison, later to be called Fort Brown, on the river opposite Matamoros.

Taylor also recognized the need to expand shipping and trade in the region

_::j
__

to assure a reliable source for, and easy access to, incoming supplies.

On a small

island just south of Brazos Santiago, he ordered the construction of a military depot
to serve as a port of entry for goods and men (Thorpe, 1846:45).

f

All of Taylor's soldiers were initially stationed at Fort Brown and at the

I

Brazos Santiago Depot. As the war expanded and more soldiers arrived, temporary
camps were established along the north bank of the river (Champion, n.d.). Precious
little is known about these camps; however, a map (Figure Z-Z) prepared by
Lieutenant J.

r:i.

Webster in 1847 shows Camp Belknap within the project area on

Loma de la Estrella.

In 1846, Taylor had also established a small military post at

the mouth of the Rio Grande (Figure Z-Z) consisting of several wooden-framed
buildings (Emory, 1857:59).

These structures were purchased by a

civilian,

William H. Clark, who later founded the town of Clarksville upon this site (Edman,

1966).

There were many small skirmishes between American and Mexican

troops throughout Taylor's early occupation of the area. The first major battle took
place on May 8, 1846 at Palo Alto, on a prairie near Loma Alta, and Taylor's troops
were victorious (Bond, 1979).

The following day, the Mexican army under the

command of General Mariano Arista regrouped and attacked at Resaca de la Palma

Five days later, Taylor occupied

Mexican

territory

(Pierce,

1917:28-330; Thompson, 1965:20-22).

All subsequent fighting took place within Mexico; thus, the battles at
Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma were the only ones north of the Rio Grande.
Hostilities ceased with the signing of the Treaty of Hidalgo on July 4, 1848. ·
Provisions of this agreement established the Rio Grande as the boundary between
the two countries, but also recognized land titles issued by the Spanish and Mexican
governments.

All public lands, however, were granted to the State of Texas

(Thompson, 19.65 :23).

At the conclusion of the war with Mexico, counties were formed
throughout southern Texas. In 1848, Cameron County was carved from the Nueces
County Land District and was named in honor of Ewe Cameron, a Texas soldier who
was executed in the Black Bean Massacre.

Santa Maria initially was the seat of

government, as recorded in the minutes of the commissioner's court, but within a
few years, the county seat moved to Brownsville.

Among the first acts taken by the county government was the issuance
of licenses for ferries to operate on the Rio Grande, reflecting the strong desire of
the county's early leaders to maintain links to, and encourage trade with, Mexico.
R. E. Clements was granted rights to operate a ferry from the mouth of the Rio
Grande to Burrita, a ranching settlement on the Mexican side (Figure 2-3).

Meehan established ferry service across the Boca Chica, thus linking Brazos Island
with

the

mainland

(Minutes

of the

Cameron

County

Commissioner's

Court,

Transcribed: var.). Besides issuing the rights to establish ferry service, the county
also set the rates that could be charged.

Although ferries were located at several

points on the river, the most important, as could be expected, were between
Brownsville and Matamoros (Graf, 1942:222).

While the lower Rio Grande witnessed much military action between the
years 1846 and 1848, the most significant impact of the war to the region was the
advent of regular steamship service.

Earlier attempts had failed primarily because

of the lack of trade and the uncertainties of navigating the river.

Taylor's almost

constant demand for supplies proved that such an operation could be successful.
With this knowledge, Charles Stillman joined forces with Richard King, who later
founded the famous King Ranch, and Mifflin Kenedy in establishing what became an
extremely lucrative shipping business along the river. The firm, begun in 1850, was
originally known as M. Kenedy &

Co.

Providing the initial financial support,

Stillman purchased most of the steamboats used by Taylor and his men.

Stillman

left the day-to-day operations to King and Kenedy, both of whom were able river
pilots who had come to the area during the Mexican War.

Terminals were

established at the mouth of the river and at White Ranch (Figure 2-4) about 10 miles
(16 km) upstream.

Almost all of the trade to and from Matamoros and the newly

settled town of Brownsville, which developed adjacent to Fort Brown, came by way
of these stations.

Imported goods from ocean-going vessels were unloaded onto

lighters and taken to wharves on the inland side of Brazos Santiago.

A steamboat

transported the freight down Laguna Madre through Boca Chica and up the river to
White Ranch.

There, the goods were transferred to a smaller steamer for travel

further up the river (Lea, 1957 :57 -59). As Lea writes, "the boats of M. Kenedy and
Co. became key factors in the economy of the lower Rio Grande and a wide section
of northeastern Mexico" (1957:77).
New York.

Stillman sold. his interests and moved to

Although King and Kenedy reorganized and founded King, Kenedy and

Co., the new enterprise operated for only a few years.

King and Kenedy eventually

became prominent ranchers in south Texas (Thompson, 1965:77).

Clarksville, on the American bank (figures Z-5 and Z-6), was founded by William

Opposite Clarksville was Bagdad, which had been a small fishing

A good description of the area was provided in 1857 by Captain William H. Emory

At the mouth of the river there are a few frame houses
erected by the army in 1846, now owned by the steamboat
company engaged in the navigation of the river. Opposite is

Civil War and Late Nineteenth-Century Development

The Lower Rio Grande became a strategic economic, trade and military
center when civil wars in the United States and in Mexico erupted during the 1860s.
U.S. military forces maintained a strong presence after the Mexican War, manning
garrisons at Fort Brown and Brazos Santiago Depot.

Jn 1860, when the question of

secession was taken to the electorate of the state; the majority of voters, including·
those in

Cameron County,

agreed to withdraw from

the Union.

When the

Later in the war, Union forces instigated a naval blockade of all
Confederate ports. As the plan was implemented, Matamoros and the nearby port of
Bagdad in Mexican territory became important outlets for Confederate cotton. In
addition, much-needed arms were transported to the Confederacy by way of these

R

same cities (Boothe, 1967 :58-59)..

On November Z, 1863, Union. forces totaling

7 ,000 men under the command of Major General Nathaniel Banks landed on Brazos
Island, occupying the depot there.

Upon news of the landing, General Bee and his

troops abandoned Fort Brown, burning many of the buildings and remaining supplies.
Union troops marched along the north bank of the river and captured Fort Brown a
few days later (Pierce, 1917 :42.-43).

~-Meanwhile, Mexico was embroiled in its own civil war that had begun in
the mid 1850s. By 1862., France, seeking to extend its influence, became involved in
the conflict.

A year later, French troops successfully invaded the country and

for the Confederacy by July 30, 1864.

Union troops retreated to the Brazos

Santiago-Clarksville area, protected by U.S. gunships anchored offshore.

There

were minor skirmishes between the two forces, however, no major fighting took
place for almost a year.
Although the Civil War officially ended on April 9, 1865, news of Lee's
surrender did not reach the southern tip of Texas for several weeks and the last
engagement of the Civil War occurred on May 12-13, 1865.

Colonel Theodore

Barrett, commander of the Union troops, wrote in his official report of the battle:
••• we returned [from White Ranch) to a hill about a
mile from Palmetto Ranch where the Thirty-fourth

Indiana had already taken its position. About 4 p. m.
the rebels, now largely re-enforced, again reappeared in
our front, opening fire on us with both artillery and
small-arms. At the time a heavy body of calvary and a
section of a battery, under cover of the thick chaparral
on our right, had already succeeded in flanking us with
the evident intention of gaining our rear. With the Rio
Grande on our left, a superior force of the enemy in
front on our right, our situation at this time was
extremely critical. Having no artillery to oppose the
enemy's six lZ-pounder field pieces, our position
became ·untenable. We therefore fell back, fighting
(Lamont, 1896:Z66).

Colonel John Ford and his troops eventually won the engagement, only to learn that
armistice had been signed .several weeks earlier (Thompson, 1965).
After the war, trad·e in the area diminished greatly, as the cotton and
arms market, so lucrative during the war years, collapsed.

So too did the fortunes

of many of the merchants and speculators who operated on both sides of the .river.
A state of chaos ensued.

General Phillip Sheridan, who commanded the remaining

Union troops, worked to bring order

~d

stability to the region.

In 1864, Sheridan ordered the construction of the county's first railroad
which ran from Brazos Santiago to White Ranch.

It was put up for bid in 1866.

Although King, Kenedy and Co. attempted to buy the railroad, another group outbid

I

them.

Unfortunately for these individuals, the railroad ended at King, Kenedy &

Co. 's riverboat terminal at White Ranch. A stalemate ensued in which goods shipped
by rail to White Ranch could not be offloaded to steamboats; thus, supplies
continued to be shipped by way of the river's mouth (Thompson, 1965:108).

Matters

were "resolved" when a hurricane struck the coast in 1867, destroying the rail line.
The same storm brought about the demise of Clarksville and Bagdad (Edman,
1966 :5).

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

Several attempts were made to re-establish rail service along the Rio
Grande in subsequent years, but none were successful until 1871 when the Rio
Grande Railway was completed from Point Isabel to Brownsville {Webb, 1952 I:Z77).
This line was used until 1933 when a deepwater port was established at Brownsville
{Hall and Grombacher, 1974:38).

The Rise of the Agricultural and Tourist Industries

The economy of the lower Rio Grande became more diversified during
the early years of the twentieth century, primarily because of the advent of largescale flood control and irrigation projects. The San Benito Land and Water Company
is credited as the pioneer in these efforts, completing the first flood-control works

'
!

on the lower river in 1907. Others soon followed {Watson, 1931 :69).
As the river was tamed and irrigated water became available to the rich
and fertile delta region, agricultural production increased dramatically. In 1907, for
example; 761 freight car shipments of fruits and vegetables produced in Cameron
County were tallied by railroad officials. In 1920, that figure reached 6,307, while a
decade later it had climbed to 28,113 {Watson, 1931 :152-53).
The tourist industry has become a dominant force in the local economy
in recent years although its early development can be traced to the 192.0s. Men such
as Sam Robertson were involved in numerous land-speculative transactions aimed at
bringing people from northern states to the area.

Robertson also envisioned the

growth of resort communities along the beach front and his Del Mar venture on

l

Brazos Island is believed by many to be among the first serious attempts at such an
endeavor {Krause, 1987). In 1929, he purchased the rights to a 640-ac tract on the
island from D. B. Pate of Louisiana {Cameron County Deed Records Volume 154,
pages 9-11); That· same year, Robertson formed Del Mar, Inc., serving as president.
Other officers included A. L. Montgomery, vice-president; Marie Robertson, secretary; and Ewing D. Clark, manager.

The company quickly implemented its plans,

Vegetative

This area is at the southern end of the Gulf Prairies and Marshes

Area of Texas and contains elements of the South Texas Plains

vegetation area which occurs to the north and west (Gould, 1975). The project area
is bordered on the south by the Rio Grande and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico.
The Lower Rio Grande Valley has a climate which includes marine,
coastal-type, subtropical, and semi-arid characteristics (USCE, 1979).

Long, hot

summers and short, mild winters produce a mean temperature of 73.Z°F (Blair,

Gulf cordgrass, black mangrove, buffalograss, curly mesquite, saltcedar, sumpweed,
mesquite, yucca, and prickly pear cactus.

Gulf cordgrass is dominant in ponded

areas, while sea oxeye, saltflat grass, glasswort, saltwort, and Gulf cordgrass occur ·

wintering place for many species of ducks and geese. Animals common in the region
are Virginia opossum, nine-banded armadillo, longtailed weasel, striped skunk,
hog-nosed skunk, coyote, bobcat, black-tailed jack rabbit, cottontail, javelina, and

Rio Grande, producing a deltaic plain characterized by meandering channels,
crevasse splays, and saline interdistributary basins. The Rio Grande system has been
undergoing net retreat for about the last 3,000 or 4,000 years, and its subsiding Gulf
margin is undergoing transgression by the Laguna Madre and Padre Island.

Recent

construction of dams on the watershed and an increasing usage of irrigation waters

Fl

have essentially eliminated normal sediment discharge through the Rio Grande
(Brown et al., 1980; Morton and Pieper, 1975).

f

I

Most of the meanderbelts, floodbasins, distributary channels, and interdistributary areas within the project area are inactive environments that were
abandoned by the shifting river earlier in its Holocene history.

The present Rio

Grande system only periodically floods, actively depositing sediment, and due to
dams, irrigation, and limited rainfall, flow is ephemera!.

Periods of activity are

usually generated by the passing of intense tropical storms or hurricanes over the

r:

area and is marked by the activation of point bar accretions, levee and crevasse
splay building, and floodwater discharge into floodbasin and interdistributary areas.
The passing of the storm, however, brings back the period,s of inactivity (Brown
et al., 1980).

The documentation of historic channel migration within the project

area is discussed in detail in Section 4.0.

3.Z.Z

Barrier Island System

Ib
The modern barri<;'r island system forms at the interface between land
and ocean resulting from the interaction of marine and terrestrial processes.

This

barrier island system was formed from reworked sediments of the Rio Grande
fluv.ial-deltaic system. The Holocene Rio Grande deltaic system prograded over the
south Texas coastline to a position approximately 10 miles (16 km) east of its
present location, depositing a complex cuspate delta system into the open Gulf of
Mexico.

Between 3,400 and 1,900 years ago, sediment supplies diminished because

of decreased river discharge brought about by decreasing rainfall and increasing
aridity in the Rio Grande watershed.

With the absence of a sufficient sediment

3-3

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

supply to maintain the delta building process, subsidence and consequent erosion of
the delta began.

Modem Brazos Island probably originated when the delta lobes

subsided, permitting waves and littoral drift to erode and rework the shoreline sands
into offshore shoals.

These shoals coalesced to form a peninsula attached to the

retreating Rio Grande deltaic headlands, and transgressed in a northerly direction
eventually connecting to middle and northern Padre Island (Brown et al., 1980;
McGowan et al., 1977; Morton and Pieper, 1975).

The main components of the barrier island system in the project area

L

are:

(1) beach, consisting of sand and shell; (Z) fore-island dune ridge, a narrow

ridge of moderately- to poorly-stabilized sand dunes; (3) sandflats, a broad, flat
area about 4 feet (ft) (l.Z meters (m)) above mean sea level (MSL) composed of a
mixture of fine-grained sand and shell (copice sand dunes have formed where
vegetation has provided limited stability); and (4) washover distributary channels and
fans, composed of sand and activated by storm-surge tides •

r
'

.The beaches of Brazos Island are composed of fine gr.ained, well sorted
sands containing abundant volcanic rock fragments, volcanic quartz, and sanadine
derived from the vo.lcanic areas of west Texas and Mexico and transported by the
Rio Grande. Heavy mineral analysis shows an assemblage of minerals distinctive to

r
it=c;

the Rio Grande source.

This composition consists of 60% basaltic hornblendes and

pyroxene,. 10% green hornblende, and 30% of the more durable minerals such as
zircon, garnet, staurolite, tourmaline, and rutile (Morton and Pieper, 1975).

Beaches along Brazos ·Island are mostly in an erosional state, however,
there is a net accretion on the upcurrent (south) side of the jetties at Brazos
Santiago Pass. Erosion of the beaches is contributed to several factors: (1) a deficit
of sand to the system; (Z) waves generated by the dominating southeast wind strike
the shoreline at a high angle, generating a strong longshore drift moving the sand
out of the area; (3) the southeast winds, along with hurricane and tropical storm
·winds, transport sand onto the wind-tidal flats and Laguna Madre; and (4) the Rio

Grande deltaic muds continue to undergo compactional subsidence, which causes a
relative rise in sea level and a landward shift in the shoreline (Brown et al., 1980).

R

Another component of the barrier island system found in the project area
is the fore-island dune ridge, a narrow, discontinuous ridge of moderately stabilized
dunes that parallel the beach creating the greatest relief along the coastline (5 to
30 ft (1.5 to 9 m) MSL).
backbea~h and

The dune ridge is the product of sands blown from the

made stable by a sparse cover of salt-tolerant grasses.

It is

important in protecting the barrier island from the impact of storm-created tidalsurges, but overgrazing, droughts, and destructive storms in the latter years of the
1800s and early 1900s initially destroyed the fore-island dunes forming broad, flat
areas called sandflats.

The fore-island dune ridge has only recently begun to

redevelop in the area (Brown et al., 1980).
A few washover channels and fans are located in the project area on
Brazos Island.

H
I

These features were created during hurricanes when storm-surge

tides breached the island.

Storm currents erode channels, transporting sand and

shell onto the wind-tidal flat where it accumulates as a washover fan feature.

The

channels are usually sealed at the seaward side by sand transported via longshore
drift in a few weeks after the storm's passage.

I

Two types of washover fans are

located in the area; one type is vegetated, the other is not. Vegetated washover fans

b

are hard to recognize as washover deposits due to their resemblance to the ridge-

swale topography of eolian deposits.

Unvegetated fans are low sand and/or shell

lobes accumulating where the channel opens out onto the wind-tidal flats (Brown
et al., 1980).

and the bay-estuary-lagoon system in the region have both shifted progressively

Dune-like ridges, locally called lomas, are found on the shore facing

Lower Laguna Madre, and on the east and north sides of these inland lakes (Price

Lomas are created by southeast winds which blow clay

particles up from dry lagoons and bay bottoms.
and compacted into hills.

These particles are then deposited

The lamas were utilized by both historic and aboriginal

inhabitants and are considered high site probability areas (Prewitt, 1974; Hall and
Grombacher, 1974).

Price (1958:59) estimated the rate of accumulation of wind-

blown clay in lomas at between 0.75 and 1.00 ft (O.Z and 0.3 m) per century. Price's
estimates were based upon the age of archaeological deposits found buried within
clay dune deposits.

In one instance, an archaeological component having an age

estimate of 1,700 years was found buried beneath 15 ft (4.6 m) of windblown clay in
a Joma (Price, 1958:59).

ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON SITE DISTRIBUTION/DISCOVERY

The physical environment of the project area has played a major role in
the location and preservation of archaeological sites, both historic and prehistoric.
Most known prehistoric sites in the region are located in areas which have a high

enough elevation to preclude inundation and/or are located on relatively stable
landforms. Lomas are, by far, the most common locations for prehistoric sites.
=

I1
R

r;

Historic sites are less often confined to lomas. Due to the importance of
shipping during the historic period, historic sites are often concentrated along
coastal inlets and major inland waterways•. It is likely that prehistoric sites also
developed in similar settings; however, the dynamic nature of the coastal .and
riverine environments within the project area (Morton and Pieper, 1975) would, no
doubt, have destroyed or obscured most such remains.

A further discussion of

riverine dynamics and their effect upon site preservation along the Lower Rio
Grande is provided in Section 4.0.

IITSTORIC DOCUMENTATION OF RIVER CHANNEL
MIGRATION
The course of the Rio Grande has changed significantly and, at times,

rapidly throughout history. For example, as recently as 1955, the river's mouth was
located 5,500 ft (1.7 km) north of its current position (U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
1955, 7.5' series topographic map, Mouth of Rio Grande, Texas quadrangle). Because
of the dynamic nature of the river, the location of the modern channel differs

I

significantly in places from its path during the mid- to late-nineteenth century. In
order to determine the location of historic sites which were adjacent to the river at
that time, it is necessary to determine where the river flowed then in relation to
present-day landmarks.

For example, numerous resacas (i.e., oxbow lakes), channel

scars, and land-locked point bar deposits, all remnants of past river channels, are

t:

visible on aerial photographs of the project area.

h

historic river channels.

I

The object of documenting river

channel migration is ultimately to correlate these river scars with the .appropriate
In this way, it should be possible to determine:

1) the

former location of historic sites which are .shown on nineteenth-century maps; 2) the
possible age· and identity of historic archaeological sites which have been recorded
within the river's recent meander belt; and 3) the location of nineteenth- versus

[

L

twentieth-century riverbank deposits.

The latter point is an important one, as cut

bank erosion, associated with channel migration, has destroyed a large portion of the
nineteenth century riverbank within the project area.
Historic maps showing the river's course during the nineteenth century
are abundant. Many of these are sketches lacking accurate scale and credibility for
purposes of documenting channel migration; however, several detailed maps also
exist which are based upon official surveys of the international boundary between
the United States and Mexico.

Three international boundary survey maps were

selected for use in documenting historic shifts in the river.

These include: 1) an

1853 map surveyed by William· H. Emory, Chief Astronomer and Surveyor, U.S.

4-1

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

I'
Corps of Topographical Engineers (Emory, 1853); Z) an 1898 map surveyed for the
International Boundary Commission (IBC) by W.W. Follett and E. Zayas (IBC, 1903);
and 3) a 1911 map also surveyed by W.W. Follett and E. Zayas (IBC, 1912.).
The process of overlaying these three maps on a present-day map of the
project area at the proper scale was complicated by the fact that none of the early
maps show sufficient, permanent landmarks which can be registered with landmarks
on current maps.

Initially, it was hoped that parallels of latitude and longitude

could be used to register the maps; however, it was found that large discrepancies
exist in the location of these parallels from one map to another.

r

I

The problem of properly registering the maps was solved by utilizing
point bars, associated with two modern resacas, as r.egister points. These points are
labelled "A" ·and "B" in Figure4-1. Point "A" is at the extreme southern end of the
point bar associated with La Burrita Banco and point "B" is at the extreme eastern
end of Stell-Lind Banco. La Burrita Banco was cut off from the United States by a

associated with these areas may contain intact archaeological sites of corresponding
age. Likewise, there is a potential for historic shipwrecks, dating to the period of
steamboat navigation, to be buried within undisturbed 1853 channel deposits and
within undisturbed deposits located between highlighted sections of the 1853 and
1898 channels (Figure 4-1).

Based upon comparisons between historic channel configurations shown
in Figure 4-1 and historic maps (figures Z-2, Z-3, 2-4, 2-5 and 6-5 (see Section 6.0)),
it is possible to determine .the approximate location of historic sites relative to
modern landmarks.

Of special note in this regard are historic riverbank sites,

including White Ranch (figures 2-4 and 6-5), "Miguel's" {Figure Z-3; possibly an

The approximate locations of the above historic sites

relative to modern landmarks have been plotted on Figil.re A-1.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF PHASES I-A AND I-B

During April of 1987, a 100% archaeological survey was conducted on
selected portions of the Playa de! Rio project area, totalling approximately
1,000 acres.

The

surveyed

areas,

designated

as

Phase I-A

and

Phase I-B

(Figure 1-2), are areas planned for development during the initial construction phase
of the Playa de! Rio project.
The survey areas are located in two distinctly different settings.
Phase I-A is situated along the left bank of the Rio Grande in an area of very little
vertical relief, the highest elevation being approximately 5 ft (1.5 m) MSL.

This

area is vegetated primarily in grasses and small shrubs. Some cacti and yucca occur
on the higher elevations.

Phase I-A contains numerous examples of river channel

scars which are visible on aerial photography.

Most of these seem to predate the

earliest known historic maps of the river; however, portions of nineteenth-century
channel and river bank deposits remain intact within the Phase I-A area (see
Section 4.0).
Prior to conducting a survey of these areas, a review of the site files at

I

h

the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (T ARL) in Austin had revealed the
presence of one previously recorded archaeological site within the areas to be
surveyed.

This site, 41 CF6, was originally recorded in 1969 as the nineteenth-

century remains of White Ranch.

Site 41 CF6 is located in the Phase I-A survey

area.

·The Phase I-B area is situated behind the beach in an area of low-lying
sand and mud flats.

The southeast portion of this survey area is covered by

stabilized dunes, the tallest of which is 22 ft (7 m) MSL.

The northern half of

Phase I-B consists of sparsely vegetated or barren tidal flat.

The remainder of the

area is vegetated in a variety of grasses.

I

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

The archaeological survey of Phase I-A and Phase I-B was performed by
a crew of two EH&A archaeologists over a period of approximately eight man-days.

l

c.l
ccj

The survey involved close inspection of the ground surface while walking over the
survey areas along parallel, linear transects.
(164 ft) was maintained between transects.

A distance of approximately 50 m
Areas having unique vegetation or

noticeable vertical relief were surveyed more closely, as such areas were suspected
of containing historic site remains. The cutbank of the Rio Grande was also closely
inspected along· the entire length of the Phase I-A survey area.
Due to a number of factors, including periodic inundation and the
dynamic nature of the riverine and dune environments, the probability for the
occurrence and preservation of prehistoric sites in the survey areas is considered
quite low.

Should any of the land surface within either area be old enough to

contain prehistoric remains, the likelihood that these would be located above the
water table or within reach of standard shovel-testing techniques is also considered

I' '

I

quite low, as the Rio

Grand~,

until this century, annually dispersed large quantities

of sediment across its floodplain. For this reason, .shovel testing was not conducted
on a systematic basis; rather shovel tests were excavated in areas suspected of
containing historic remains.
Ground-surface visibility in the survey areas was generally from 10 to
30%; although portions of the Phase I-B area were unvegetated tidal flats having

f

!

l 00% visibility.

A low-lying area in the eastern half of the Phase I-A survey block

held standing water from recent heavy rains.

This area may be the remnant of a

previous river channel and associated point bar deposit.

Due to the depth of the

water, this area was not surveyed.
As mentioned above, only one site, 41 CF6, bad been previously recorded
within the survey areas.

A thorough description of · this site and of the work

conducted there is provided in Section 6.1.

Artifacts from Site 41CF6 will be

curated with existing collections from this site at the Texas Historical Commission.

No additional archaeological sites were discovered during the survey of Phase I-A

yuccas and cacti, for example) is located approximately in the right place to be

ASSESSMENT OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL/HISTORIC SITES
In order to provide a baseline assessment of the cultural resources

present· in the Playa del Rio project area, all known archaeological sites within the
property were investigated by a team of two EH&A archaeologists during April,
1987.

This work involved relocating each site and evaluating its potential for

eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

In the case of

several sites, cultural remains were not located. It was necessary, in such cases, to
base a large portion of the evaluation upon the results of previous investigations in

le

combination with the physical condition of the reported site location.

I

A total of 11 previously-recorded or reported archaeological sites were
investigated during the course of the field work (figures A-1 and A-Z). This number
includes eight sites having State trinomial site designations (41 CF4, 41 CFS, 41 CF6,
41 CF7, 41 CF9, 41 CFS!, 41 CF93 and 41 CF!ZS), two sites which were recorded by
A. E. Anderson in the 1930s and designated after his own numbering system (58.4E
and 58.6), and one previously unrecorded site which is located outside of the project
area, but which is in the vicinity of a proposed project road across the southern tip
of Brazos Island.

L

This site, the historic resort community of Del Mar, has been

subsequently designated as site 41 CF1Z7.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED OR REPORTED SITES

6.1.1

Site 41CF4 - Brazos Santiago Depot
Site 41 CF4, Brazos Santiago Depot, was an important center of military

i

I

and commercial activity in the Lower Rio Grande Valley during much of the historic
period.

The first recorded visit to the area was in 1 SZO when a Spaniard, Diego de

Camargo, christened the pass between Brazos and Padre Islands "Brazos de San
Iago".

Although Brazos Santiago Pass was undoubtedly used by ships during the

6-1

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.
I

I
intervening years, it was not until 1846 that the north end of Brazos Island came to
be extensively used when General Zachary Taylor constructed .a military supply
depot there (Thorpe, 1846:45),

By 1848, a lighthouse, a star-shaped fort, a

customhouse, and several storage buildings had been built.

El

During the height of the river steamboat trade that followed, the depot
at Brazos Santiago served as an important commercial shipping port.

Due to the

shallow water and treacherous bar at the mouth of the Rio Grande, goods were
generally shipped to Brazos Santiago Depot where they were transferred to a
shallow-draft river steamer for transport down the coast and then up the river.
With the advent of· the Civil War, Brazos Santiago once again became a
strategic military outpost and supply depot. The depot was captured by Confederate

IH

!

Ii

forces early in 1861, then retaken by Union troops on November

z,

1863. The Union

maintained control of the island throughout the remainder of the war, forcing the
Confederates to import and export merchandise by way of Bagdad at the mouth of
the river.
In 1864, General Sheridan began construction of a railroad line from

Brazos Santiago Depot down the island and across the mainland to White Ranch.
The rail line was used to transport goods between Brazos Santiago and the river boat
landing at White Ranch until completion of the Rio Grande Railroad between
Brownsville and Point Isabel in 187Z signalled the end .~f the river· steamboat era on
the lower Rio Grande.

[j

Throughout the history of Brazos Santiago Depot, a number of structures
were built on the site, including warehouses, wharves, barracks, fortifications,
hospitals, and a railroad line. Several historic maps exist which have been overlaid
on a 1970 topographic base map in figures A-3 to A-10 in order to delineate areas of
occupation relative to modern landmarks.

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

Brazos Santiago Depot was first brought to the attention of archaeologists in 1967 when Hurricane Beulah uncovered large areas of the site which had
been previously covered by sand.

The site was visited by archaeologists following

the storm, at which time artifacts were collected from several areas. These areas

B
'

'

'

are shown in Figure A-11, as are the locations of the terrestrial magnetic survey
conducted by EH&A (1981), and the deep draft marina facility, proposed for
construction as part of the current undertaking.
The preservation of perishable items and structural remains at Brazos
Santiago Depot, following Hurricane Beulah, was considered exceptional.

Tunnell

and Jensen (1971) described the site condition following the storm as follows:

Here before us were thousands of supply wagon tracks, many
with the draft horse and oxen boofprints in between them.
Neat rows of tent pegs and the wooden bases to flagpoles and
large buildings abounded. The wooden foundation to the first
lighthouse built in the Port Isabel area and hundreds of other
architectural features lay exposed and as fresh as the day
they were built.

L

Artifacts of every description were so profuse that it was
literally impossible to carry more than a small portion back
to Austin for study and preservation. Most noticeable among
the artifacts are the large numbers of well-preserved perishable items -- boots, shoes, rubberized ponchos, wood, and
cloth which, after lZO years of being submerged in saltwater,
look almost new after preservation.

r

I:
t

tJ

Similar materials were observed at the site following a severe hurricane in 1933
(Champion, 1938).
At the time of the 1967 collections following Hurricane Beulah, the
location of numerous exposed architectural remains and features was mapped in
Area 1 (Figure A-11) using a plane table (Corbin and Webb, 1967). Most of the area
included in this map bas subsided below sea level.

Mapping was possible due to an

unusually low tide; however, the work had to be completed quickly (Corbin 1983).

[

L

No field notes were taken during the mapping of the site (Corbin, 1983); however,
Tunnell (1987) stated that nearly all of the cultural features that had been exposed
by the storm were located within Collection Area 1.

Attempts to accurately

pinpoint the locations of these features relative to the boundary of the proposed
marina are complicated by the fact that the few landmarks included on Corbin arid
Webb's (1967) map do not appear on recent maps of Brazos Island. These landmarks
include a double row of pilings which cross Area 1 from northwest to southeast and
an unnumbered survey marker placed there by the USCE in 1933. The double row of
pilings reportedly supported a railway used in construction of the stone jetty at

r

Brazos Santiago Pass during the early twentieth century (Hoyt, 1987).

All mapped

features are located at least 180 ft (SS m) northeas_t of this line of pilings.
Examination of low level oblique aerial photographs (on file at the Texas
Historical Commission (THC)) taken of the site by Tunnell following Hurricane
Beulah indicates that this double line of pilings and all of the features mapped by
Corbin and Webb (1967) may be located northeast of the proposed marina boundary.
Accurate plotting of feature locations relative to project boundaries should be
possible using low level vertical photographs, provided that the double row of pilings
from Corbin and Webb's (1967) map is visible in the photographs.
The site was again visited in 1970 by archaeologists from the THC at
which time additional artifacts were collected. The site had been covered with sand
by this date; however, glass and ceramic fragments dating from the mid-nineteenth
century were recovered from the backdirt of holes dug by bottle collectors in Area 3
(Prewitt, 1987). Brazos Santiago Depot was nominated to and listed on the NRHP in
1971.
In 1980, the site was once again uncovered, this time by Hurricane Allen.

Having been informed of extensive looting by collectors, archaeologists from the
THC returned to the site, Artifacts were systematically collected from ZOO x ZOO ft

(61 x 61 m) units laid out in a grid over the northern part of the island (Banks,
1983 :45), Unfortunately, a map showing the location of these collection units is not
available (Banks, 1983 :169).
In 1981, a terrestrial magnetometer survey was conducted on portions bf

Brazos Santiago Depot.

This work was conducted by EH&A, as part of the Brazos

lsland Harbor Channel Improvement Project of the Brownsville Navigation District
(EH&A, 1981).

The area encompassed by the magnetometer survey (Figure A-11)

includes most of the proposed marina, the entirety of collection areas 1 and 5, and
the southwestern portion of collection areas A and B.

The survey was performed with a Geometrics model 806 marine survey
magnetometer, a Geometrics model 806 base station sensor, and a Soltec 5-inch
dual trace recorder.

Power for the instrumentation was provided

by two heavy-

duty batteries aligned to produce Z4 volts. The instruments were placed in a Hustler
all-terrain vehicle (A TV), which provided mobility across the survey area.

The land magnetics survey team included an instrument operator, who
drove the A TV and operated the magnetometer console. A second individual .carried
the base station sensor in a shoulder pack and walked about 50 ft ahead of the ATV,

L

tethered by the sensor cable connected to the magnetometer console.

To aid in

maintaining a constant pace over the debris, vegetation, and varied terrain, a third
individual kept the sensor cable free of snags and clear of the A TV during
maneuvering.

It was necessary for the individual with the sensor to remove all

metallic objects (keys, change, knives, etc.) from his person to reduce magnetic

!l
I

interference. The magnetometer survey team could traverse the lines at a natural
walking pace.
The magnetometer was adjusted to take readings of 1-gamma sensitivity
at 1-second intervals. Readings were continously recorded on a strip chart moving
at 8 cm per minute.

Use of the base station sensor in a mobile survey mode

6-5

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

increases the noise level of the data, due to the sensor's sensitivity to motion and
orientation to the earth's magnetic field.

With careful orientation and cushioning

from the shocks and jars of walking, the sensor noise level was maintained at
.:!:_3 gammas.

E!

During the land magnetics survey, lines with unacceptable noise levels in
the data, or with unusually high magnetic activity, were rerun in an effort to
maintain acceptable noise levels and to .determine the validity of the earlier data.
On several lines, the rerun data did not confirm the earlier readings, suggesting

external magnetic interference. External interference such as this can be caused by
solar activity, microwave radiation, or overheating of the sensor through constant
use.

The approximate location of the

position of magl)etic anomalies within the area indicated on Figure A-11. Based on
a compari_son of Figure A-11 with figures A-lZ through A-15, there does not appear
to be a good correlation between the areas of dense anomaly concentrations and the
location of the 1967 collection areas.

L

There do appear to be distinct areas of

concentrated magnetic activity, as well as areas notably Jacking in anomalies;
however;

insufficient data exist to determine whether clusters of anomalies

represent features associated with Brazos Santiago Depot or whether they are
caused by modern debris.

Ji

In April of 1987, Brazos Santiago Depot was visited by EH&A archaeo-

logists as part of the baseline assessment of the site for the Playa de! Rio project.
A reconnaissance survey of the site, concentrated on collection areas 3 and F,
showed it to be once again covered with sand. This portion of the site is vegetated
by dense grasses, limiting ground surface visibility to 0-ZO% in most areas.

No

artifacts or cultural features were observed. The portion of the site in the vicinity

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC. ·

L

of the proposed marina (Figure A-11), likewise, has been covered with sand.
Accurate delineation of the site boundaries is, therefore, not feasible on the basis of
a reconnaissance survey.

A comparison of historic maps (figures A-3 to A-10) with Figure A-11,
which illustrates the locations of areas proposed for dredging, the 1967 collection
areas, and the area of the 1980 magnetic survey, indicates a large discrepancy
between what is known about the site from historic sources versus what is known.
archaeologically and what is suggested by the magnetic data.

Based upon the

location of the 1967 collection areas (Figure A-11), portions of the site will be
impacted by the proposed dredging. Historic maps of the island (figures A-3 - A-10)
indicate, on the other hand, that structural remains may be missed, in most cases,
by impacts from dredging.

1-i

Data collected during the 1981 magnetic survey

(figures A-lZ through A-15) indicate that numerous magnetic anomalies will be
impacted by the proposed dredging of the marina and associated channel. However,
it is not known whether these anomalies are associated with the historic remains of
Brazos Santiago Depot.

Due to the uncertainties in the locational data from Brazos Santiago
Depot, it is recommended that the site boundaries and locations of cultural features

L

within the Playa del Rio project area be accurately delineated in order to allow a
precise determination of impacts which would result from the proposed undertaking.
As mentioned above, site boundaries cannot presently be delineated on the basis of a
reconnaissance· survey due to a covering of sand over the site.

An alternative

method for delineating site boundaries would involve a second magnetic survey
followed by archaeological verification of a sample of anomalies.

Site 41 CFS
In 1968, the remains of human skeletons were discovered by beach-

combers near the mouth of the Rio Grande.

These bones were found "in an area

about six feet square at the base of the Gulf-side of a sand .dune••• about 300500 yards (Z74-475 m) north of the mouth of the Rio Grande" (Lynch, 1968). The
bones were analyzed by A. B. Wesolowski (1968) from the Department of Anthropology at The University of Texas at Austin. It was determined at this time that at
least two individuals were present. Both are young males estimated to have been
from 19 to Z1 years old at death. A third individual was suspected on the basis of a

pathologies were observed on any of the bones.

No

Race was not determined as the

skulls were not found. Two of the bones bad metallic stains: an iron oxide stain on
the distal posterior shaft of one humerus and a green copper-like stain on the
anterior portion of the iliac crest on one of the innominates.

I-

The origin of these skeletal materials is uncertain.

The possibility that

they are prehistoric is not likely, due to the highly dynamic environment of this
area.

Shifting of sand· dunes due to storm ·generated winds and high tides, in

combination with rapid changes in the course of the river near its mouth, make it
unlikely that the dunes in this area are of prehistoric age.

The presence of only

young adult males makes it much more likely that the bones are those of soldiers

11

L

from either the Mexican or the Civil War or possibly those of former residents of
Clarksville, nearby.

Champion (n.d.) stated that burials were common in the sand

dunes during the Mexican War, but that erosion of the graves by wind and wave
action shortly after the war resulted in the reburial of many soldiers by the military

I

on Loma de las Ebanitos. For a more complete description of these events, see the
discussion of Site 41 CFS!, Loma de las Ebanitos Cemetery, below.

I
I

Based upon the description of the site location by Lynch (1968), the
present attempt to relocate this site was concentrated on the. Gulf side of sand
dunes within 600 yards (549 m) of the river's mouth.

A crew of two archaeologists

walking the Gulf facing dune bases within this area was unsuccessful in locating the
site.

It is possible that ,shifting sands have reburied any skeletal materials which

1.

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

may remain.

The limited size of the site, however, in combination with the fact

that someone had apparently carried away the skulls prior to discovery by Lynch,
suggests the likelihood that nothing remains of the site.

F-l

The site is located in a

proposed natural preserve; thus, any portion of the site which might remain
concealed by the dunes will not be affected by the Playa de! Rio project.

Based

upon the available information, no statement of National Register eligibility can be
made for Site 41 CFS at this time.
6.1.3

Site41CF6
This historic site is located approximately 250 m (820 ft) northeast of

the current course of the Rio Grande (Figure A-1). The site was formally recorded
and given a site number in 1969 by Curtis Tunnell and H. P. Jensen. At that time,
they reported the presence of historic artifacts dating to the mid-'llineteenth

1-i

century spread over an area of several hectares. They characterized the site at this
time as extensively potted with "potholes several feet deep" present on the site
(Tunnell and Jensen, 1969).

II

L

The site was visited again in 1970 by Prewitt & Associates, at which
time a large sample of artifacts was collected from the site including:

50 ginger

beer bottle fragments, 1 nearly complete ginger beer bottle, 26 other historic
ceramic fragments, 108 glass bottle and jar fragments, 2 metal buttons, animal
bones, and a small amount of building material including brick, mortar and window
glass.
In April 1987, the site was investigated by archaeologists from EH&A.

At this time, the site had been impacted by construction of a paved road across the

I

western portion of the site, by the excavation of a narrow surface drainage across
the site, and by the erosion of several shallow washes which cover large areas of the
site. Impacts to the site observed at this time occurred prior to the inception of the
current undertaking. A sketch map of the site (now on file at TARL) was prepared

the margins of eroded areas (Figure 6-1). Based upon .the extent of the artifacts in
these areas, the site size is estimated at lSO x ZSO m (49Z x SZO ft).

:-_-!

Three shovel tests were excavated in order to determine the depth of the
cultural deposit.

Two of these were excavated along the margins of eroded areas

and one at the highest portion of an erosional remnant. All were excavated in areas
of relatively high artifact density, as observed in the. erosional cuts.

These shovel

tests were excavated to depths of 40, 60 and 70 centimeters (cm) (16, Z4 and
ZS inches); however, cultural materials were limited to the upper ZO cm (8 inches) of
soil in all cases.. Charcoal flecking was also observed in each shovel test but only in
the first ZO cm (8 inches).

'

I-!

The soil associated with the cultural horizon is a light

gray sandy loam. At a depth of approximately ZS cm (10 inches), the soil changes to
a lighter color with a significant increase in clay content and the addition of minute
chalky white inclusions in the soil.

I

LI -

L

No soil change was observed below the ZS-cm

(I 0 -inch) level.

Examination of the artifacts collected during this most recent visit to
the site indicates the presence of a definite Civil War period occupation. Four brass
military buttons with a spread-eagle motif were recovered at this time. These are
typical of the General Service button of the Union Army from 18S4-190Z (Albert,
1969:39-40). Three Minie balls were also recovered, including a Williams .SS caliber
slug. The Williams cartridge was used by the Union Army from 1861 to the end of
the war (Black, 1987).
Based upon information provided by Jack Bartholomew, a long-time
resident of .the area, 41 CF6 was initially identified by Tunnell and Jensen (1969) as
the former location of White Ranch, a mid-nineteenth century riverboat depot.

A

comparison of nineteenth-century ·maps with documented changes in the course of
the Rio Grande (Figure 4-1), however, indicates that White Ranch was located

The operation of ferries was taxed and licensed by Cameron County.

a ferry license was

much as.575 m (approximately one-third of a mile) southeast of 41CF6 based upon
the position of the 1853 river channel relative to the modern channel (Figure 4-1).
The location of White Ranch as shown in figures Z-4 and 6-5 (seep. 6-40) is 1,550 to
Z,650 m (approximately 1 to 1.6 miles) west/southwest of 41 CF6, respectively.

Hanson's 1894 sketch (Figure 2.-4) illustrating the location of White
Ranch along the northwest bank of a meander should be regarded as the most
accurate available, with respect to the true position of White Ranch.

The

configuration of the river channel in Hanson's (1894) sketch is nearly identical to
that shown in Figure 4-1 for 1898 (IBC, 1903), with the exception that La Burrita
Banco had been separated from the United States by a channel shift in 1895 (IBC,
1910:31).
The position of Shin's Ferry as plotted on the anonymous mid-nineteenth
century sketch shown in Figure 2.-3 cannot be regarded with the same degree of
accuracy as Hanson's (1894) sketch.

While the river channel shown in Figure 2.-3

approximates the 1853 channel configuration (Figure 4-1), it is very obviously a
hand-drawn sketch, whereas Hanson's was probably traced or, at least, based upon

I-,

his survey notes. · In addition, Shin's Ferry is represented in Figure 2.-3 by a rather
large symbol, occupying the entire bend of the river; thus, we cannot be certain
precisely which position on the bend the symbol was intended to indicate.

Hanson,

on the other hand, using a larger scale for his map (Figure 2.-4), indicated White
Ranch by three small structure symbols located at a fairly discrete point on the

outside of a river meander.
Although the identification of 41 CF6 as Shin's Ferry is tentative, it is
the opinion of the investigators that the site is not the remains of White Ranch, as
was previously thought to be the case.

Although no cultural features have been

observed at the site, the presence of building materials, such as brick, nails and
window glass, indicates that a structure(s) was present on the site.

I

The fact that

this site was occupied during the Civil War, and may have functioned as a major
river crossing prior to and during this conflict, indicates that it may be eligible for
the NRHP.
Currently proposed development in the vicinity of 41 CF6 calls for the
site to be covered by fill dirt to raise the elevation.

Site 41 CFi - Clarksville
The community which came to be called Clarksville was occupied from

1846 to 1874.

During the Mexican War in 1846, the army erected a few frame

houses on the site (Emory, 1857 :59). These buildings served as a military post for
General Zachary Taylor. . Following the war, the buildings were apparently purchased by William H. Clark, a civilian who had been superintendent of Taylor's post.
In subsequent years, Clark served as an agent for M. Kenedy Co. which ran a

steamship line on the lower river (Edman, 1966).

L

Emory's (1857:59) sketch of the town in 1853 (Figure Z-6) shows at least
nine structures, several of which are two-story.

These buildings were apparently

constructed on wooden pilings (King, 1953 :85).

An 1854 U.S. Coast Survey map

(Figure Z-5) shows at least 15 structures concentrated along the left bank of the

L
I

river. Across the river, the community of Bagdad is shown to be slightly smaller at
this time.

Bagdad later mushroomed to a population of thousands during the Civil

War, due to the lucrative blockade-running business. Clarksville, however, remained
fairly small. The exact number of structures on the site is not known.

Clark owned

a general store, his own home, and several rent houses (Edman, 1966 :Z). According
to King (1953:86), 16 of Clark's rent houses were destroyed by a hurricane in 1867.
A second storm in 1874 apparently destroyed the remaining structures.

The historic townsite of Clarksville was first recorded as an archaeological site in 1969. The site was described at this time as having "few traces left,
large pieces of rusted metal, debris only" (Tunnell and Jensen, 1969).

The site was

recorded as covering two or three hectares "behind stabilized dunes and covered
with blow sand", 150 m (49Z ft) west of the Gulf and 50 m (164 ft) north of the Rio

13

Grande (Tunnell & Jensen, 1969),

The site was later visited by Prewitt (1970) who

collected a variety of historic artifacts including 14 glass bottle fragments, one
stoneware sherd, one whiteware rim sherd,. one porcelain sherd, two bricks, two
pieces of asphalt, a shell casing and a screw.
During the April 1987 visit to this site by EH&A, the area recorded by
Tunnell and Jensen (1969) was intensively surveyed.

The majority of the area

recorded by Tunnell and Jensen is low-lying, vegetated mud flat.

This. area was

partially inundated at the time of the current survey. The eastem margin of Tunnell

1-l

and Jensen's (1969) site area is covered by small stabilized backdunes. Four shovel
tests were excavated along a north-south line in the backdune area. Low-lying areas
between the dunes were selected for placement of these shovel tests. No artifacts
were recovered from the shovel tests.

in every case. Only one artifact of possible Clarksville vintage was observed on the
site. This is a blue transferware bowl rim of unknown origin, found at the northern
end of the site as mapped by Tunnell and Jensen (1969) (Figure A-1). ·More recent
debris present on the site includes the rusted remains of two automobile bodies and
numerous beverage containers.

The presence of an historic component at Site 41 CF7 is apparent from
the artifacts which have been collected there; however, documentation of shifts in
the river indicates that the river has encroached upon Clarksville (compare
figures Z-5 and 4-1), removing most, if not all, traces of the site which may have
remained following the 1874 hurricane. This is corroborated by King:

6-15

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

Recently, when the Clark sisters (daughters of William H.
Clark) who were born there returned to the spot of their
birth, they revisited the site but were unable to find the spot.
The Rio Grande had changed its course and was flowing over
the site that had once been Clarksville (1953 :87).
Historic accounts of the destruction of Clarksville and of the subsequent
encroachment of the river upon the site (King, 1953), in combination with independent corroboration of the latter event (see Section 4.0), suggest that the
townsite no longer exists. This does not, however, rule out the possibility that some
habitation areas associated with Clarksville were located farther north and west
than indicated on sketch maps of the townsite. Another possible explanation for the
position of Site 41 CF7 is that the area was used for garbage disposal by the
residents of Clarksville.

I-!

Although it is possible that the artifacts observed by Tunnell and Jensen
(1969) and by Prewitt (1970) were associated with an outlying portion of the
Clarksville townsite, .it is also possible that they were associated with a quarantine
station which Hanson shows in. his 1894 sketch .of the river (Figure Z-4).

The

quarantine station is plotted more accurately on an 1898 boundary survey map of the

11

river (IBC, 1903).

The approximate position of this quarantine station relative to

the present river course is shown in Figure A-1.

regarding the role of the quarantine station in the history of the area.

By this late

date, steamboat traffic on the river was insignificant to the regional economy; thus,

Equally little is known archaeo-

An objective documentation of the hori-

zontal distribution of artifacts relative to the river channels shown in Figure 4-1
and of the potential age range of these artifacts would be necessary to strengthen

I

the argument that these materials may be associated with the former quarantine
station rather than with the Clarksville townsite.

Although no artifacts were

discovered below the surface during the present survey, the potential exists for
subsurface cultural materials to exist.

The dynamic nature of the environment

6-16

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

would, however, suggest a low potential for the survival of intact structural
remains.

It is the opinion of the investigators that the majority of the Clarksville

townsite has been destroyed by channel migration and by beach erosion, the latter
resulting from a greatly decreased sediment load in the Rio Grande in this century.

Fi

While it is possible that Site 41 CF7 may be associated with outlying portions of the
Clarksville townsite and/or with the latter quarantine station known to have existed
in the vicinity, our present knowledge of the site is insufficient to allow a positive
identification or to allow an accurate assessment of its potential for National
Register eligibility. Further archaeological testing may be necessary to accomplish
the above assessments.

A visit to this site by EH&A archaeologists during the current investigations failed to identify two discrete concentrations of artifacts which could be

The only cultural material observed in the suspected vicinity of Area II was recent
household refuse which had been discarded in two trash heaps adjacent to dirt
roadways.

Vegetation, however, is extremely dense inside the treeline east of

Area I, consisting of ebony trees, brush thickets, and a heavy cover of knee-high
grasses. Surface visibility in this area is near zero except along dirt roadways where
it averages about 80%.

The suspected location of Area II was intensively surveyed

with negative results. Two shovel tests, both culturally sterile, were also excavated
in this area to a depth of approximately 30 cm.

The extreme hardness of the clay

soil hampered digging, making it infeasible to conduct extensive shovel testing on
the site within the time available.

The historic identity of Site 41 CF9 is unknown.

Although reported as

two possible house sites, no structures, domestic or otherwise, are known to have
existed in the vicinity of the site.

The presence of ceramic ginger beer bottles

indicates a mid-nineteenth century occupation.

The only historically-documented

use of this Joma during the nineteenth century was Camp Belknap (Figure 2-2), a
temporary military encampment occupied during 1846 by approximately 6,000 U.S.
troops (Champion, n.d.; Webster, 1847a, 1847b). This camp was only occupied for a
brief period and presumably lacked permanent structures. Based upon the location
of Camp Belknap as plotted on Webster's (1847a) map (Figure 2-2), it is unlikely that
the artifacts recovered from 41 CF9 are associated with the remains of this military
encampment.

Although the remainder of Loma de la Estrella has not been

systematically surveyed, it is probable that cultural materials associated with the
Camp Belknap occupation are present in other areas.

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

Based upon what is currently known of the area recorded by Tunnell and
Jensen (1969) as 41 CF9, a determination of National Register eligibility is not
possible at this time. Area I (Figure A-1) has been severely altered by erosion, and
no cultural materials, other than modern debris, were found in the vicinity of

[~l

Area JI.

Nevertheless, due to the possibility that cultural materials associated with

Camp Belknap exist on Loma de la Estrella, it is recommended that any projectrelated impacts to this Joma, especially to portions of the lama located east of
41 CF9, be preceded by an intensive survey of these areas.

Site 41 CFSl - Loma de !os Ebanitos Cemetery

This site was first reported to .the Texas Historical Commission by A. A.
Champion, a former owner of the land on which the site is located. Champion (n.d,)
stated that, through the years, he had seen human remains exposed on many
occasions on the north slope of Cemetery Hill (Loma de los Ebanitos),

On one

occasion, he remembered "having seen a whole human skeleton partly exposed and
the rest still embedded in the clay wall of the hill" (Champion n.d.).

According to

Champion, this site was used as a cemetery by the U.S. military during the Mexican

11

L

War (Figure Z-Z).

Champion wrote a brief description of the history of this

cemetery from which the following excerpt is taken.
Troops from Maryland, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee,
Georgia, Alabama and other states were encaml'ed at
Belknap [Figure Z -z] for several weeks [during 1846] • The
camp had between 7 and 8 thousand troops at one time.
Disease... took the lives of about one in ten of all volunteers
during the war. On Aug. ZS, an Illinois trooper wrote that
they buried a fine young man and had to leave him beneath
the turf of the chaparral grove. By him lie some of the
K~ntucky troops. There are interred in this vicinity a great
many men from the states, and a funeral or two takes place
every day "We have to lay the dead in the vault without
coffin or box, for the boards or plank cannot be found in this
place.•

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

Other military camps were used during the war along the
Gulf beach, at Brazos Santiago and the mouth of the river
and their dead were buried close by or wherever they fell.
After the war, a soldier of one of the regiments returning
home wrote that he strolled out to the dunes so thickly
populated with our dead. "The revelation was shocking," he
said. "Wind and wash had hauled away the covering of the
graves, exposing their contents." His colonel ordered him to
take a working party and rebury all remains. Later the Army
detailed working parties in wagons gathering all bodies found
uncovered and taking them to the little Cemetery Hill and
Camp Belknap and reburying in a more permanent sepulchre
(Champion, n.d.).

Although Champion has conducted considerable research on the subject, he does not
reference his sources.

Due to health reasons, Mr. Champion was unavailable for

questions at the time that the current project was being researched.

In April, 1987, Site 41CF51 was examined by EH&A archaeologists.

The

surface of the loma was heavily vegetated by grasses at this time, affording near
zero visibility of the ground surface, except in roadways.

It was

immediat~ly

evident, as had been stated by Champion (n.d.), that large portions of this loma on
the north and east sides have been mined away, leaving a nearly vertical cutbank
3 m (10 ft) high (Figure 6-2). No cultural or human remains were observed along the

cutbank where they had been reported by Champion (n.d.).

It is apparent from

examination of the loma remnant below this cutbank that the loma originally
extended at least an additional 30 m (98 ft) to the north and east.
In the early part of the twentieth century, Loma de los Ebanitos was

used as a U.S. military rifle range.

.(Figure 6-2).

Although no

evidence of human burials was observed on the site during the current investigation,
the possibility that additional burials may exist cannot be ruled out short of

It is, therefore, recommended that subsurface

disturbance of this loma during construction be limited where possible.

If

subsurface disturbance is expected, archaeological monitoring of construction
activities should be practiced.

Site 41 CF93 - Palmito Hill Battlefield
The last battle of the Civil W;u was fought on, and in the vicinity of,

Palmito Ranch on the western periphery of the Playa del Rio project area on May 1 Z

fl

and 13, 1865.

Although Lee had surrendered at Appomattox on April 10, word had

not reached the Texas front.

An historical monument describing this battle is

located along the south side of State Highway 4, just inside the extreme western
edge of the project area.

The following account of this battle is based upon the

Official Records of the War of the Rebellion (Lamont, 1896:2.65-2.69).
On the night of May 11 at 9:30 p.m., a force of ZSO men of the Sixty-

second U.S. Colored Infantry and 50 men of the Second Texas Cavalry, not mounted,
crossed Boca Chica Inlet from Brazos Island and advanced toward White Ranch

~I

where they expected to encounter a Confederate outpost of 65 men.
White Ranch by Z a.m. on May lZ, they found it deserted.

Arriving at

Being too exhausted to

make Palmito Ranch by daybreak, the Union troops spent the remainder of the night
hidden among the brush and weeds of the river bank a mile and a half above White
Ranch (this would have been south of Loma de la Estre.lla just downstream from

Buri ta). At 8 :30 on the morning of the lZth, they were discovered by persons on the

Mexican side of the river who alerted the Confederate troops.

The Union troops

most of the way. By noon, the Confederates had been driven from their camp at
Palmito Ranch. The Union forces stopped to rest on the hill at Palmito Ranch from
where, at 3 p.m., they sighted "a considerable force of the enemy".

The hill was

considered indefensible so they retreated to White Ranch for the night, skirmishing
along the way.

During the night, Lt. Col. Branson, commanding the Union troops,

sent for reinforcements from Brazos Island.

At daybreak they were joined by ZOO

men from the Thirty-fourth Indiana Volunteer Infantry and, once again, advanced
toward Palmito Ranch.

"Skirmishing soon commenced; continued all the morning."

Halting at Palmito Ranch to burn the Confederate supplies remaining after the
previous day's raid, the Union troops then advanced two miles further upstream

6-2.3

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

where "a sharp fight took place in the thicket on the river bank" (Branson, 1865:268).
Following this engagement, the Union troops fell back a mile and a half to a bluff on .
the river "about 1Z miles from Boca Chica" (west-southwest of Palmito Hill),
intending to spend the night there.

rj

At 4 p.m., however, a large force of the

Confederate cavalry was observed trying to cut off their rear.

Seeing this, Col.

Barrett ordered a line of men to be formed on the right flank extending (away from
the river) obliquely to the rear.

This skirmish line,· consisting of 140 men,

immediately· came under the fire of Confederate artillery from a hill located a mile
and a half upriver.

Under the protection of their right flank, the Union forces

retreated in quick time along the course of the river, skirmishing much of the way
back to Boca Chica.

Colonel Barrett (1865:267) stated that the "last volley of the

war, it is believed, was fired by the Sixty-second U.S. Colored Infantry about sunset
of the 13th of May, 1865, between White's Ranch and the Boca Chica, Tex."

I~

The Battle of Palmito Hill was fought primarily along the banks of the
Rio Grande in the vicinity of Palmito Ranch.

The portion of the battle which

occurred downstream from Palmito Ranch to White Ranch, including the portion
located within the Playa del Rio project area, consisted of running skirmishes

II
L

associated with the advance and retreat of the Union forces. The hills mentioned in
the above account still exist, although outside of the project area.

The only

landmark within the project area which is mentioned in accounts of the battle is
White Ranch which has been destroyed by river encroachment in subsequent years
(Pierce, 1917:61; also see sections 4.0 and 6.2.2.1).

A large portion of the land

surface which was river bank during 1865 has been eroded by channel migration and

u

replaced with more recent sediments (Figure 4-1), thus reducing the portion of the
actual battleground which lies within the current project area. No attempt has been
made to archaeologically document the Palmito Hill battlefield.

To do so is not

considered feasible, as the battle was spread out over a large area, was of ·short
duration, and was primarily a running battle between infantry and cavalry, involving
artillery to only a limited degree. The historic significance of the Battle of Palmito
Hill lies primarily in the fact that it was the last battle of the Civil War. It was not

Site 41 CFlZS
This site is an unidentified historic shipwreck believed to date to the

nineteenth century. The vessel is located on the beach just outside of the Phase I-B
survey area. In 1980, the surf line was located approximately ZOO ft (61 m) east of
the wreckage. At the time of the present survey, the wreckage was covered over by
sand, and thus could not be located and examined. The vessel was first discovered in
1967 when it was exposed by Hurricane Beulah. In 1980, following Hurricane Allen,

I,

the wreck was again exposed and this time recorded by archaeologists from the
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC).

Only the uppermost portions of the frames

were exposed above the sand and these showed evidence of burning. Two large test

IJ
L

pits and severa.I smaller holes were excavated at this time in order to determine the
dimensions and characteristic construction of the vessel.

The results indicated a

boat measuring 88 ft (27 m) long and having a 20-ft (6-m) beam.

The hull is

constructed in a carve! fashion of wooden planking, fastened together with wooden
treenails.

Copper sheathing is present between the interior hull planking and the

frames; however, the outer hull apparently lacks sheathing.

I

Although the identity of the vessel at Site 41 CFIZS is unknown, the style
of construction suggests that it was probably built during the nineteenth century
(Arnold, 1986).

The possibility that this vessel contains intact structural elements

which may embody characteristics distinctive of an historically-significant type of

vessel, or of a. specific time period of historic significance, indicates that this site
may be eligible for the NRHP. This site is located entirely within an area currently

Site 41 CF127 - Del Mar

The remains. of a small resort community known as Del Mar are located
in Brazos Island State Park near the south end of Brazos Island (Figure A-1).
Mar was founded in 1929 by Sam Robertson, a local engineer.

Del

At one time, the

community consisted of 26 beach cottages, bath houses and a dance hall pavilion
(Allhands, 1960:94-96; Lindhorn, 1987).

At the time that Del Mar was founded,

Brazos Island was separated from the mainland by Boca Chica Inlet; therefore,
Robertson constructed a low, wooden, one-lane bridge to the island and charged a
10¢ toll (Lindhorn, 1987).
Del Mar was destroyed by a hurricane in 1933.

Today the remains of

several structures are present at Del Mar, consisting primarily of railroad ties used
as building pilings (Figure 6-3).

Several brackish wells can be found scattered

around the townsite in low-lying areas between the dunes. These apparently served

L

as a water supply for the small beach cottages (Lindhorn, 1987).

A large concrete

water tank (now collapsed) constructed on wooden pilings at the top of a tall dune
served as an additional source of water.
Although the Del Mar townsite is located on State-owned land, outside of
the Playa del Rio project area, the possibility that a portion of this site would be
impacted by construction of a proposed roadway across the southern portion of
Brazos Island was investigated.

recommended as eligible

for the NRHP; however, the proposed roadway, as

currently staked, will miss all visible structural remains by at least 50 m (164 ft),
thus no impacts to the site will result from the project.

It is the opinion of the

Texas State Historic Preservation Officer that the increased population resulting

Fl

from development of the area mai result in vandalism of this site; therefore, it is
recommended that the site receive sufficient documentation to allow a determination as to its NRHP eligibility status.

Anderson's Sites 58.4E and 58.6

Two prehistoric sites were recorded by A. E. Anderson on Loma de las
Vacas in the 1930s.

Following his usual method for designating sites, Anderson

referred to these sites by the longitudinal parallel on which they occur. In instances
where two sites were found on the same parallel, they were differentiated by adding
the letter "E" to one, as with Site 58.4E.
1-:

I

Sites 58.4E and 58.6 were recorded,

respectively, on the west and east ends of I;oma de las Vacas (figures A-1 and A-Z).
Anderson collected only one artifact from each site. A Starr arrow point was found
at Site 58.4E and a bone ornament at Site 58.6.

Anderson's artifact collection is

currently being curated at TARL; however, the bone ornament is missing from this
collection (Boone, 1987). Neither site has been relocated in subsequent years; thus,
they have not been assigned Smithsonian Trinomial System site numbers.

During the April 1987 examination of these sites by EH&A, an extensive
area of vertical cutbank (Figure 6-4), located along the west, north and east margins
of the loma and measuring approximately 6-7 m (ZO-Z3 ft) in height, was examined.
Visibility of this cutbank surface was 100%; however, no cultural materials were
observed.

I

Due to the apparent lack of significant cultural deposits, neither site is

recommended as potentially eligible for the NRHP.

As Loma de las Vacas is a

proposed natural preserve, no project-related impacts to these sites are expected.
In the event that impacts become imminent, additional attempts to locate and

assess these and other sites is recommended.

River Steamboats and Other Watercraft
Steamboat navigation on the Rio Grande played a major role in the

development of the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

Steamboats first appeared on the

river in 18Z9 (Graf, 194Z:65) and continued until at least 1884.

The most active

period of river navigation, however, was between 1846 and 187Z. Graf (l 94Z:6Z-75,
l 9Z-Z06) provides an excellent synopsis of navigation on the lower Rio Grande.
Due to the hazards of navigating such a shallow and winding river, a
large nuinber of vessels were wrecked. The first portion of Table 6-1 lists a total of
Z8 vessels which were wrecked in the river in Cameron County during the nineteenth
century.

This information was compiled from the shipwreck file of the TAC in

Austin, Texas.

Very little precise information is known regarding the locations

where these vessels were wrecked.

Another vessel, the sidewheeler Mexico,

Based upon the documentation of historic channel migrations, illustrated
in Figure 4-1, it is apparent that portions of the mid-nineteenth century river bed
have remained undisturbed within the project area.

Although the Camargo is the

only vessel known to have wrecked in the river within the project area, the
possibility that other wrecks may be present within the undisturbed portions of the
nineteenth-century riverbed should be considered.

The latter portion of Table 6-1 lists 46 nineteenth-century vessels which
wrecked at or near the mouth of the Rio Grande. Several of these vessels may have
been lost while trying to maneuver around the bar just beyond the mouth of the
river.

fl

It is possible, however, that some were lost within the river's mouth, for

example, at the Clarksville docks, but reported as lost "at the mouth of the river".

Ii
In addition to these vessels, there are approximately 75 vessels reported
as having wrecked· in or near Brazos Santiago Pass. Figures A-8 and A-10 illustrate
the approximate locations of two unidentified wrecks which, given the margin of
error possible in overlaying historic sketches on modern maps, may currently be
located either beneath the sediments of Brazos Island or in the bottom sediments of
Brazos Santiago Pass.

A study to delineate areas containing possible historic shipwrecks, as

well as historic features associated with Brazos Santiago Depot, was conducted by

From December 1980 to February 1981, a marine magnetometer survey
was conducted along portions of the Brownsville Ship Channel (EH&A, 1981) in an
attempt to delineate areas which might contain the remains of historic shipwrecks.
The area covered by the survey was divided into five channel sections: Clark Island
Section, Brazos Island Section, Jetties Section, 1050 Section and 750 Section.

The

0.8-mile long Brazos Island Section is located inside Brazos Santiago Pass, adjacent

·In order to acquire more accurate data as t6 the true size of a magnetic

anomaly, the depth of the sensor was varied to keep the sensor no more than 30 ft
from the bottom. Sensor depth was adjusted by changing the length of cable trailing
behind the vessel (1 ft depth per 3 ft total cable deployed 5 knots), or in very
shallow water by floating the sensor on the surface. As the inshore segments of the
survey had water depths of 1 ft to 45 ft, the amount of cable trailed (sensor offset)
could not remain constant. Sensor offsets varied from 150 ft offshore, to ZS ft with
the sensor on a float inshore. All changes of offset were noted on the data and its
accompanying running log.
The marine magnetometer survey identified a large number of magnetic
anomalies from the Clark Island Section t.o a point just offshore of the jetties.

The work of Clausen and Arnold (1975), Arnold (1976; 1978) and Arnold and Weddle
(1978) have concentrated on an area north of the project in the area of the 1554
Spanish wrecks. In 1975, the TAC also conducted a marine magnetometer survey of
the shore from just north of the mouth of the Rio Grande to a point 7 km (4.Z miles)
north of Brazos Santiago Pass.

As a result of this ·survey, three possible and two

probable wrecks were delineated (USCE, 1977 :16),

In order to avoid accidental

discovery of wreckage in the project area, especially in undisturbed riverine
sediments of historic age and in areas bordering on Brazos Santiago Pass, it is

L

recommended that subsurface impacts be preceded by some form of remote-sensing
survey. Although magnetic surveys have been conducted on the north end of Brazos
Island and in Brazos Santiago Pass (EH&A, 1981), no form of archaeological
verification of magnetic anomaly sources accompanied· this work.

Relocation of

anomalies identified at this time would require additional magnetic surveying.

Historic Place Names

6.Z.Z.l

White Ranch

The tentative identification of Site 41 CF6 as Shin's Ferry leaves us
wondering where White Ranch may have been located. The location of White Ranch

6-38

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

is shown on two historic maps, one dating to 1881 (Figure 6-5) and one to 1894
(Figure Z-4).

A comparison of these maps with the 1853 and 1898 river channels

(Figure 4-1) indicates that White Ranch was located south of Loma de los Ebanitos
in the vicinity of the abandoned Port Isabel Reservoir or slightly to the east in the

fJ

western portion of the Phase I-A survey area (Figure A-1).

The latter location

seems more probable based upon the attention to detail which Hansen gave his 1894
sketch (Figure Z-4). Further cause for doubting the location indicated in Figure 6-5
is due to the fact that the river channel in this .map dates to 1847 (compare with
Figure Z-Z).

Thus, the map illustrated in Figure 6-5 was originally traced from

Webster's (1847 a, 1847b) map, after which place names were added in their
approximate locations.

That these positions are, indeed, approximate is further

emphasized by the misplacement of "Palmeto" (Palmito) Ranch on this same map.
Pierce (1917:61) stated that White Ranch had been washed away by the
encroachment of the river. He went on to say that the railroad bed from Sheridan's
railroad between Brazos Santiago and White Ranch "remains intact from the nearest
f 1

11

approach to the site of White's Ranch down to Boca Chica, where the bridge piling
still stands" (Pierce, 1917:61). Although the pilings and roadbed west of Boca Chica

fl

!j

L

remain visible from the air today, no trace of the railroad bed is visible in the
vicinity of the river which might pinpoint the former location of White Ranch.

No

cultural material was observed in the western portion of the Phase I-A survey area
during the current investigation.

The area surrounding the Port Isabel Pumping

Station, although located outside of the Phase I-A survey area, has been extensively
disturbed by construction of water reservoirs and a levee and by the excavation of
drainage canals, thus it is likely that materials associated with White Ranch, if once
present in this area, would no longer remain intact.

Camp Belknap

Camp Belknap was a temporary military encampment for United States
troops during the Mexican War.

According to Champion (n.d.), Camp Belknap was

occupied briefly during 1846 by approximately 6,000 troops.

The location of this

camp on Loma de la Estrella is shown on an 1847 map of the area (Figure Z-Z).

The tent symbols used to indicate Camp Belknap in Webster's (1847al
map (Figure Z-Z) suggest a temporary encampment. It is possible that some type of
more permanent standing structures existed there; however, no evidence of their
existence has been reported.

Although the remains of Camp Belknap have never

been verified archaeologically, artifacts dating from the nineteenth century have ·
been recorded at 41 CF9 on the western end of Loma de la Estrella.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A baseline study of the cultural resources located within the Playa de!

Rio project area has been conducted, This work involved assessing the significance
and archaeological potential of the known archaeological sites, Also included within
this study were suspected sites which had not been recorded by an archaeologist or
reported by a local informant, but which were known from maps or other historic
references to have existed in the project area at one time. In addition to assessing
known sites, an archaeological survey was conducted of two areas proposed for
development during the initial phase of the project. The information resulting from
this survey was incorporated into this report as a summary of the cultural resources
present within these specific areas, designated Phase I-A and Phase·I-B; however,
this information also proved useful as a means of ground-truthing suppositions
regarding the whereabouts of certain suspected historic site locations which were
known only from historic references.
A review of archaeological site records showed that nine archaeological
sites had been reported within the current project area boundaries.

L

These include:

41CF4, 41CFS, 41CF6, 41CF7, 41CF9, 41CF51, and 41CF1ZS, all of which are
historic sites, and two prehistoric sites recorded as sites 58,4E and 58,6 by A.E.
Anderson during the 1930s. In addition to these nine sites, portions of Site 41CF93,
the Palmito Hill Battlefield, are known from historic references to be located within
the project area. The 1930s resort community known as Del Mar (41 CF1Z7) was also

I:

included within this report due to its proximity to a proposed project-related
roadway.

Sites known from historic references to have existed within the project

area at one time, but which have never been archaeologically verified, include White
Ranch, Miguel's,. an· 1898 quarantine station at the mouth of the. Rio Grande, the
wreck of the steamship Camargo, Camp Belknap, and St. Anna's Canal.

7-1

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

L

In the case of known archaeological sites, assessing significance and
archaeological potential involved historically documenting each site and examining
each site in the field to determine the nature, extent, and archaeological integrity
of the cultural deposits. In the case of those sites located adjacent to the river, this
also involved documenting the position of the sites relative to known changes in the
course of the Rio Grande in order to determine whether intact portions of these
sites could be expected and whether place names shown on historic maps of the river
could be correlated with archaeological remains observed in the field.
Based upon the results of site assessments, specific recommendations
were made with regard to additional site investigations which may or may not be
necessary before an accurate assessment of project-related impacts can be made.
Recommendations have been provided on a site by site basis in Section 6.0 and are

r

briefly° summarized below. Included with each recommendation is a statement as to
whether the site is recommended as being eligible or potentially eligible for the
NRHP.
41 CF4 - Bra.Z os Santiago Depot

L

This site has been listed on the NRHP; therefore, mitigation of projectrelated impacts is required.

Due to the fact that sand and/or water covers all of

Brazos Santiago Depot, it is not possible to visually assess the impacts which this
site might receive as a result of the current undertaking.

It is, therefore,

recommended that the physical limits of the site be delineated using a combination
!

'

of remote sensing, such as magnetic surveying, and archaeological testing of
selected magnetic anomalies. Having delineated archaeologically-sensitive areas in
this manner, it will be possible to determine appropriate mitigative measures.

No further archaeological investigation is recom-

mended unless human skeletal remains are encountered during clearing or construction activities.

I.!_]
L

Should portions of this site remain intact, it may be considered

eligible for the NRHP.
41 CF93

Due to the diffuse nature of the cultural materials associated with the
Battle of Palmito Hill, especially those portions inside the project area, it would not
be feasible or productive to archaeologically document this historic event; therefore, no further investigation is recommended. The site may, however, be eligible
for the NRHP under Criterion A (36 CFR, Section 800.10).
41CF125
The remains of this historic ship are considered by the investigators to
be potentially eligible for the NRHP; however, the site is located· in an area

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

currently proposed as a natural preserve and will not be impacted by the current

B

undertaking. No further investigation is recommended at this time.

41CF1Z7

Fl

J

The historic townsite of Del Mar is recommended as being potentially
eligible for the

NRHP due

to its uniqueness as one of the earliest resort

communities on the Texas coast. This site is located on State lands and will not be
impacted by the current undertaking; thus, no further investigation is recommended.
Anderson's Sites 58.4E and 58.6

fl
LJ

Due to a lack of cultural materials from all investigations subsequent to
when Anderson recorded these sites in the 1930s, neither site is recommended as
being eligible for the NRHP, and no State .of Texas site numbers will be assigned.
These sites, if they still exist, will not be impacted by the current undertaking, as
they are located in a proposed natural preserve.

No further investigation is

recommended.

I

Additional Recommendations

~

In addition to site-specific recommendations,

the following general

recommendations are offered:

1-

All dredging activities which will affect intact channel deposits dating to

(

the period of steamboat navigation on the Lower Rio Grande (see the 1853 and 1898
channels in Figure 4-1) should be preceded by a magnetic survey of the area in
question and/or carefully monitored, as it has been demonstrated that historic
shipwrecks may be present in such deposits.

7-5

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

I

L

Project-related impacts to Loma de la Estrella, if any, should be
preceded by an intensive archaeological survey in an attempt to locate the remains
of Camp Belknap.

R'
r:
I'

Marine and land dredging operations associated with channel construction from the Brownsville Ship Channel to and beyond the present shoreline of
Brazos Island will be necessary to provide vessels with access to the deep-draft
marina facility proposed for construction on the north end of Brazos Island.

Such

dredging should be preceded by marine and terrestrial magnetometer surveys of the
proposed channel followed by archaeological verification of selected magnetic
anomalies, as this area has a high probability of containing the remains of historic
shipwrecks and features associated with Brazos Santiago Depot.
