Archeology 101: Recognizing and Documenting Archeological Sites
On January 30 and 31, 2009, TAS will partner with the
Williamson Museum to present an Archeology 101
Academy in the historic Williamson County Courthouse. On Feb. 1, participants will conduct field exercises at the Gault Site. This Academy will introduce
basic archeological procedures, techniques for recovery
of data, and methods for preserving valuable archeological resources

Friends and colleagues: Turkey is a
country where cultural heritage, enhanced by the added dimension provided
by archaeology, is a key element of economic planning. Global Heritage Fund is
working with Turkish agencies on an exemplary heritage development project described in Saving Turkey’s Treasures:
Eastern Anatolia, Turkey, the latest video
feature on our nonprofit streaming-media
Web site, The Archaeology Channel
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org).
An ancient Armenian capital now
part of Turkey in the heart of the South
Caucasus region, Kars alternately came
under Byzantine, Turkish, Georgian,
Russian, and Armenian control. Until recently, the Kars Historic District was a poor squatter settlement, a
backwater without city services such as
sewage, waste management and utilities. Global Heritage Fund is working
with the Kars Municipality, the Turkish
Government, and others in eastern Anatolia to mix historic preservation and urban revitalization with community development and sustainable tourism.
This and other programs are available on TAC for your use and enjoyment. We urge you to support this public
service by participating in our Membership (http://www.archaeologychannel.org/
member.html) and Underwriting (http://
w w w. a r c h a e o l o g y c h a n n e l . o r g /
sponsor.shtml) programs. Only with your
help can we continue and enhance our
nonprofit public-education and visitorsupported programming. We also welcome new content partners as we reach
out to the world community.
