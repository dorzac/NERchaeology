Between April 15 and 21, 2009 Blanton & Associates, Inc. conducted intensive non-collection
archeological surveys of FM 1391 at Cedar Creek Relief (CSJ: 1396-01-011) and FM 1565 at Draw (CSJ:
1494-02-007) in Kaufman County, Texas prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway
improvement construction. The proposed construction would be conducted within the existing FM 1391
and FM 1565 right-of-way by the Texas Department of Transportation’s Dallas District. Augmented by
subsurface testing, investigations discovered no archeological resources within the proposed construction
areas. It is the opinion of Blanton &Associates, Inc. that the project should be allowed to proceed as
planned without additional archeological investigations, as the proposed construction should not affect
any State Archeological Landmarks (13 TAC 26.12) or archeological historic properties pursuant to 36
CFR 800.4(d)(1). No artifacts were collected and curation was unnecessary.

PROJECT TITLE: Intensive Archeological Survey of FM 1391 at Cedar Creek Relief and FM 1565 at
Draw in Kaufman County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenching prior to proposed bridge replacement and
roadway improvement construction on FM 1391 at Cedar Creek Relief (CSJ: 1396-01-011) and FM 1565
at Draw (CSJ: 1494-02-007) in Kaufman County, Texas County, Texas. The proposed construction would
occur within the existing FM 1391 and FM 1565 right-of-way.
The existing concrete bridge-class culvert at Cedar Creek Relief on FM 1391 is about 60 feet long and 32
feet wide with two 10-foot wide lanes and six-foot wide shoulders. The proposed bridge would consist of
a 150-foot long by 46-foot wide prestressed concrete slab with two 12-foot wide lanes, 10-foot wide
shoulders, and a one-foot wide safety rails. The approach roadways to the bridge would be widened to a
maximum of 40 feet to accommodate two 12-foot wide lanes and variable width (0 to eight feet)
shoulders for approximately 350 feet from the eastern end of the bridge and 350 feet at its western end.
The overall Area of Potential Effect therefore measures approximately 850 feet long, a maximum of 100
feet wide, encompasses about two acres, and extends to a maximum depth of approximately 20 to 30 feet
below the ground surface for bridge supports and three feet or less for approach widening.
The existing concrete box culvert bridge at Draw on FM 1565 is 35 feet long and 29 feet wide with two
10-foot wide lanes and four-foot six-inch wide shoulders. The proposed bridge would consist of a 104foot long by 46-foot wide pre-stressed concrete slab with two 12-foot wide lanes, 10-foot wide shoulders,
and a one-foot wide safety rails. The approach roadways to the bridge would be widened to a maximum
of 40 feet to accommodate two 12-foot wide lanes and variable width (0 to eight feet) shoulders for
approximately 318 feet from the eastern end of the bridge and 278 feet at its western end. The overall
Area of Potential Effect therefore measures approximately 700 feet long, a maximum of 100 feet wide,
encompasses 1.6 acres, and extends an estimated maximum depth of 20 to 30 feet below the ground
surface for bridge supports and four feet or less for approach widening.
PROJECT LOCATION: FM 1391 at Cedar Creek Relief is in southeast Kaufman County
approximately 3.5 miles east of Kemp, Texas and FM 1565 at Draw is in north Kaufman County
approximately seven miles north of Terrell, Texas.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 3.6
DATE OF WORK: Between April 15 and April 21, 2009
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.

TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 5226
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Based on extensive disturbances from surface and subsurface utilities, as well as a lack of
archeological deposits within the project areas, Blanton & Associates, Inc. recommends that the proposed
construction should be allowed to proceed as planned within the existing right-of-way without additional
investigations, as the survey discovered no archeological historic properties eligible for inclusion to the
National Register of Historic Places or sites eligible for formal State Archeological Landmark
designation. Further, as the proposed project area has been extensively modified by buried utilities,
drainage improvement, and roadway construction and maintenance, there is little to no potential for any
archeological historic properties eligible for the NRHP or SALs to be discovered during construction. If
the planned construction should require additional work space outside of the existing and proposed rightof-way, then additional cultural resource investigations in those areas may be necessary.

I NT R ODUC T I ON
Between April 15 and 21, 2009, Blanton & Associates, Inc., conducted intensive non-collection
archeological surveys of FM 1391 at Cedar Creek Relief (CSJ: 1396-01-011) and FM 1565 at Draw
(CSJ: 1494-02-007) in Kaufman County, Texas prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway
improvement construction by the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Dallas District..
FM 1391 at Cedar Creek Relief is in southeast Kaufman County approximately 3.5 miles east of Kemp,
Texas and FM 1565 at Draw is in north Kaufman County approximately seven miles north of Terrell,
Texas (Figures 1 through 4). The proposed construction would be conducted within the existing FM 1391
and FM 1565 right-of-way (ROW).
The existing FM 1391 ROW at Cedar Creek Relief is 100 feet wide with a 24-foot wide paved roadway
containing two, 10-foot wide lanes and 2-foot wide shoulders (Appendix A). The existing concrete
bridge-class culvert at Cedar Creek Relief is about 60 feet long and 32 feet wide with two 10-foot wide
lanes and six-foot wide shoulders. The proposed bridge would consist of a 150-foot long by 46-foot wide
prestressed concrete slab with two 12-foot wide lanes, 10-foot wide shoulders, and a one-foot wide safety
rails. The approach roadways to the bridge would be widened to a maximum of 40 feet to accommodate
two 12-foot wide lanes and variable width (0 to eight feet) shoulders for approximately 350 feet from the
eastern end of the bridge and 350 feet at its western end. The overall APE therefore measures
approximately 850 feet long, a maximum of 100 feet wide, encompasses about two acres, and extends to a
maximum depth of approximately 30 feet below the ground surface for bridge supports and three feet or
fewer for approach widening.
The existing FM 1565 ROW at Draw is 100 feet wide with a 20-foot wide paved roadway containing two,
10-foot wide lanes and no shoulders (see Appendix A). The existing concrete box culvert bridge at the
crossing is 35 feet long and 29 feet wide with two 10-foot wide lanes and four-foot six-inch wide
shoulders. The proposed bridge would consist of a 104-foot long by 46-foot wide prestressed concrete
slab with two 12-foot wide lanes, 10-foot wide shoulders, and a one-foot wide safety rails. The approach
roadways to the bridge would be widened to a maximum of 40 feet to accommodate two 12-foot wide
lanes and variable width (0 to eight feet) shoulders for approximately 318 feet from the eastern end of the
bridge and 278 feet at its western end. The overall APE therefore measures approximately 700 feet long, a
maximum of 100 feet wide, encompasses 1.6 acres, and extends an estimated maximum depth of about 30
feet below the ground surface for bridge supports and four feet or less for approach widening.
Because the planned construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered
by TxDOT, the proposed project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now
subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary
conditions for recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that
any state agency must identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could
potentially damage those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of Archeology
administers the code’s provisions. Archeological surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities
Permit issued by the THC in accordance with the provisions of the code. This project was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5226 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.

It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to consider the effects on cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are
federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states
that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by
federal agencies.
Consideration of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on
criteria defined by the National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Protection of archeological sites
under state law is tied to eligibility for formal SAL status pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. Federal and state
review of this project will occur pursuant to First Amended Programmatic Agreement among the FHWA,
TxDOT, the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation (ACHP), and TxDOT regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings
(PA-TU), as well as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council
of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all
cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural resources be located, make
recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or
further investigations.

Kaufman County is located within the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic region (Fenneman 1931, 1938).
Topographically, the study area is nearly level to gently rolling. The climate of the project area is
characterized as humid subtropical with abundant and well-distributed precipitation.
G E OL OG Y
Geology of the FM 1391 project area is Holocene alluvium, which consists of floodplain deposits (gravel,
sand, silt, and silty clay (Barnes 1972). Geology in the FM 1565 APE is Upper Cretaceous age Nacatoch
Sand, described as fine grained quartz sand with thin calcareous sandstone beds the lower and upper parts
of the formation (Barnes 1972). Regionally, Holocene alluvium has consistently been shown to have a
good potential for containing buried archeological deposits. In contrast, Nacotoch Sand has virtually no
potential for containing intact archeological deposits as the Upper Cretaceous predates known human
occupation for the region. Sandy and loamy soils that developed in situ from Nacotoch Sand could
contain some archeological remains, though any cultural deposition would likely be a palimpsest of debris
from multiple occupations and not intact.
SOI L S
Soils in the FM 1391 project area consist of Aufco soils, frequently flooded, which are deep bottomland
soils formed in recent clay alluvial sediments. A typical profile exhibits a series of five A horizons
extending to about 185 centimeter below the ground surface (Pringle 1977).
The FM 1565 APE contains three soils: Axtell fine sandy loam, 1 to 4 percent slopes, which is an upland
soil that developed in situ from clay and sandy clay under post-oak forest conditions, is in the southeast
and southwest quadrants of the creek crossing; along the creek channel is Kemp loam, frequently flooded,
a deep bottomland soils formed in recent clay alluvial sediments that extends to a depth of at least
150 centimeters below ground surface; in the northeast and northwest quadrants of the creek is the
Lufkin-Rader complex of upland soils that developed in place from sediments under post oak savannah
conditions and can extend to depths of 200 centimeters below ground surface; its two A horizons are
about 20 centimeters of fine sandy loam overlying clay and silt clay from 20 to 200 centimeters (Pringle
1977).
F L OR A
Kaufman County lies in the Texan biotic province, which represents a transitional zone between the
eastern woodlands and the western grasslands (Blair 1950). The province has been divided into four
subregions: the Blackland Prairie and Grand Prairie of the Blackland Prairies region, as well as the Oak
Woodlands and Eastern Cross Timbers of the Oak Woods and Prairies region.

Prior to filed investigations, A review of records available on the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (TASA) was conducted to determine the presence of any previously recorded sites or previous
project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of the APE. The research indicated that there are no previously
recorded archeological sites within a 1,000-meter radius of the FM 1391 or FM 1565 APE. TASA
indicated, however, that approximately 100 meters east-northeast of the southeast corner of the FM 1565
bridge is the Dry Creek Cemetery (THC Cemetery No. KF-CO53). The following text is from the THC
Historical Marker (No. 8506) in the cemetery:
Named for a nearby ravine, this burial ground originally served the community of
Turner's Point located on the overland stage road between Shreveport, Louisiana and
Dallas, Texas. The settlement was established by Elisha Turner in 1845. In the 1870's
the town was moved to a new location (1.5 miles southeast) and re-named Poetry. The
earliest marked grave at this site is that of Samuel Key (1840-1871). Now closed for
burials, the cemetery has 279 burial sites bearing names of English, Scottish, Irish and
Welsh pioneer settlers of the area.

B&A conducted an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey of the FM 1391 and FM 1565 APEs with
surface and subsurface investigations as necessary in accordance with an appropriate research design
(developed pursuant to 13 TAC 26.21(d)) and survey methods as defined in the Department of the
Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the CTA (THC n.d.).
Surface investigations consisted of an inspection of the ground surface within the APEs, as well as those
areas adjacent to and visible from the APEs. Where possible, cutbank profiles along the creeks were
inspected for the presence of buried archeological deposits.
Given the potential for Holocene alluvium and the presence of alluvial soils along Cedar Creek Relief and
the Draw, backhoe excavations proceeded as necessary (and possible) depending upon field conditions.
Backhoe trenches were approximately five meters (16.4 feet) long, 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) wide, and
1.5 meters (4.9 feet) deep and plotted with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
Following excavations, archeologists immediately cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ
artifacts, cultural features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units identified in
each trench were described on a B&A geologic profile form. All trenching activities were monitored by
an archeologist to avoid any unnecessary damage to potentially buried archeological deposits. Because of
the aforementioned saturated conditions throughout the APEs, trench excavations were not possible in
every quadrant of every creek crossing. Further, the roadways are associated with significant fill sections
and/or ditches and, buried utilities that restricted safe backhoe trenching. When trenching was warranted
but no possible due to restricted space, subsurface testing involved hand-excavated shovel tests.
Shovel tests were 30 centimeters in diameter or on a side and excavated with a standard round point or
square head shovel in arbitrary 20-centimeter levels to a maximum depth of 100 centimeters below
ground surface or until soil characteristics or bedrock preclude deeper excavation. All removed soil was
screened through 0.25-inch wire mesh to ensure artifact recovery. All appropriate data was recorded on a
B&A shovel test form and all shovel test locations were plotted with GPS. Investigations utilized a
no-collection strategy so curation was unnecessary.

R E SUL T S OF I NV E ST I G A T I ONS
Intensive survey efforts discovered no archeological resources within the FM 1391 and FM 1565 APE.
Previous surface and subsurface disturbances from buried and overhead utilities, drainage improvement
(e.g., ditches and culverts) erosion, and highway construction have truncated and/or thoroughly disturbed
all soils within the APE.
F M 1391 A T C E DA R C R E E K R E L I E F (C SJ : 1396-01-011)
Surface investigations on FM 1391 revealed a steep, tall (ca. three meters), and wide fill section
occupying the majority of the existing ROW (Figure 5). As Figure 6 illustrates, the fill section typically
extended to the ROW boundary fences on either side (north and south) of the roadway. There are also
ditches paralleling both sides of the FM 1391 roadway as well as a buried AT&T fiber optic cable in the
southeast and southwest quadrants of the creek crossing. Guard rails are present along both sides of the
roadway that prevented vehicular (e.g., backhoe) access, though even without the rails vehicular access
would not have been possible as machinery would have been forced to drive on the steep and elevated fill
section for about .50 mile just to reach the eastern approach roadway to the bridge crossing.
Given the difficulties with backhoe access, subsurface investigations consisted of systematic shovel test
(ST) excavations. A total of 12 STs (1 through 12) were excavated in the APE for the recovery of buried
archeological deposits (Table 1; see Figure 5). Shovel tests extended to a maximum depth of
55 centimeters below ground surface and yielded no archeological materials, only construction fill with
modern debris overlying two or three strata of dense sandy and/or silty clays. Based on the results of field
investigations, it is the opinion of B&A that there is little to no potential for the existing FM 1391 at
Cedar Creek Relief APE to contain intact archeological resources.

Surface investigations on FM 1565 revealed a steep, tall fill section in the northwest quadrant of the APE
and evidence of previous disturbances from surface and subsurface utilities (e.g., AT&T fiber optic cables
paralleling both sides of the roadway), ditches, a large (ca. 18 to 24-inch diameter) corrugated steel pipe
culvert at the entrance to Dry Creek Cemetery, and road construction, as well as roadway flooding.
(Figure 7 and Figure 8).
Of particular concern during survey investigations was the proximity of the historic Dry Creek Cemetery
to the north edge of the FM 1565 ROW and the possibility of unmarked graves extending into the ROW
(Figure 9). An inspection of the cemetery determined that the distance between the northern edge of the
existing FM 1565 ROW and the enclosure around the marked graves is 39 meters (128 feet). Because of
previous impacts, surface investigations revealed no evidence suggesting the presence of unmarked
graves potentially associated with the cemetery in or immediately adjacent to the existing ROW.
To determine if there were graves within the FM 1565 ROW, as well as to test the remainder of the APE
for buried archeological resources, subsurface investigations involved the excavation of three backhoe
trenches (BHTs 1 through 3) and seven shovel tests (STs 1 through 7) (Appendix B; Table 2; see
Figure 7). The excavation of BHT 1 occurred in the southeast quadrant of the APE on the south side of
the roadway opposite the entrance to Dry Creek Cemetery. BHTs 1 and 2 exhibited three soil zones
consisting of construction fill overlying two sandy clay strata to a maximum depth of, respectively,
130 and 145 centimeters below ground surface. BHT 3 was excavated to a maximum depth of
190 centimeters below ground surface and exhibited four strata comprising, from top to bottom,
construction fill overlying two sandy clay zones that in turn overlie silty clay. Excavations discovered no
archeological resources.

Because of the proximity of buried fiber optic cables and the presence of ditches on both sides of the
roadway, trenching locations were restricted and shovel testing was performed instead. A total of seven
STs (1 through 7) were excavated in the APE for the recovery of buried archeological deposits (see Table
2; see Figure 7). Shovel tests extended to a maximum depth of 60 centimeters below ground surface and
yielded no archeological materials, only construction fill with modern debris overlying two or three strata
of dense sandy and/or silty clays (see Table 2). Shovel testing discovered no archeological resources.
Based on the results of field investigations, it is the opinion of B&A that there is little to no potential for
the existing FM 1391 at Cedar Creek Relief APE to contain intact archeological resources.

SUM M A R Y A ND R E C OM M E NDA T I ONS
Intensive archeological survey efforts within the existing FM 1391 ROW at Cedar Creek Relief and
FM 1565 at Draw discovered no archeological resources. In the APEs are soils disturbed from previous
surface and subsurface impacts that include erosion, utilities, drainage improvements, and roadway
construction. Subsurface investigations within the proposed APE on FM 1565 at Draw revealed
construction fill overlying truncated soils that in turn overlaid basal clay and no evidence that previously
unknown grave were/are in the ROW. Excavations on FM 1391 at Cedar Creek Relief reached basal clay
or were halted due to water seepage and/or rock and fill obstructions that prevented further excavation.
The above data suggest that there is little to no potential for the FM 1391 at Cedar Creek Relief and
FM 1565 at Draw APEs to contain previously unidentified archeological historic properties (36 CFR
800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12). B&A recommends therefore that because no archeological deposits
were discovered within the APE and the previous levels of disturbance within the APEs are not conducive
to the preservation of intact archeological deposits, the proposed construction should not affect any SALs
or archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1).
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional ROW for the proposed construction or future projects,
then additional cultural resource investigations may be necessary in those areas. In the event that
previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area
of discovery would cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental
discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
