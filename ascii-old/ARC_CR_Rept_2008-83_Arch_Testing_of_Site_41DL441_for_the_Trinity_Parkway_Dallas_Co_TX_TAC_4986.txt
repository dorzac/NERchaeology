ABSTRACT
On September 25, 2008 a series of backhoe trenches were excavated in the
floodplain of the Trinity River in Dallas Texas. The trenching was to
relocate the buried hearth (41DL441) that was discovered in Trench 34
during the initial testing for the Trinity Parkway in 2006. Charcoal from
the hearth and at a loci thought to be on the same horizontal surface as the
hearth were dated to 170± 40 BP [1886 AD] and 230±40 BP [1796 AD]
respectively.
The second backhoe trench exposed the top of the hearth, a thin ash lens
and some burned clay. Mixed with the ash was a single shard of slightly
curved clear bottle glass. The glass was not warped or discolored by heat
and had been included in the matrix after the fire was extinguished. No
other artifacts were noted in or around the burned clay or the ash. Four
more trenches in close proximity to the exposed hearth did not reveal any
other deposits or artifacts. No artifacts were collected for curation. Site
41DL441 is younger than first thought and since no other artifacts or
features are associated with it the site is not deemed eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL).
Based upon the results of the testing, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends
that the North Texas Tollway Authority be allowed to construct in the site
area without the need for further cultural resource investigations.

INTRODUCTION
The North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA) is proposing the construction of an
approximately 9 mile long limited-access toll facility from IH35E/SH183 interchange
(north terminus) to the US 175/SH310 interchange (south terminus) in the City of Dallas
in Dallas County, Texas. The proposed facility is known as the Trinty Parkway. The
Trinity Parkway would provide a needed reliever route around the existing freeway loop,
which encircles downtown Dallas. If implemented, the Trinity Parkway would initially
consist of four to six mixed-flow main lanes, local street interchanges and freeway-tofreeway interchanges. The proposed Trinity Parkway Supplemental Draft Environmental
Impact Statement is currently under development, evaluating eight (8) build alternatives
and a no-build alternative. The study area includes the Dallas Floodway, a federal flood
conveyance and levee system carrying the main stem drainage flows of the Trinity River.
In consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT), the area-of-potential effect (APE) for
archaeological resources has been established (pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(a)) for the
proposed build alternatives. The APE generally consists of 100 feet on either side of the
Dallas Floodway levee toe (bottom of the slope) in those areas where the proposed
alternatives would be immediately on the inside (river side) or the outside of the levees (a
distance of approximately 6 miles). The APE includes the areas of proposed ground
disturbance in all other areas. The estimated right-of-way required for the proposed
Trinity Parkway ranges from 264 to 490 acres, depending on the alternative. The road
surface for alternatives within the Dallas Floodway would typically be located on a raised
embankment along the levees. Potential excavation areas within the floodway that could
serve as a source of borrow material for roadway embankment may disturb a total
estimated surface area of up to 335 acres. The assumed average depths of excavations
within the potential floodway borrow areas range from 3 to 18 feet below ground surface,
and the estimated volume of soil that may be excavated from these areas is 5.9 million
cubic yards.
Because the location of the APE is either heavily developed or in areas disturbed by
previous floodway and levee construction, the archaeological field survey of the APE has
been limited to the Dallas Floodway in areas where old meanders of the Trinity River are
located and also the general area of potential borrow excavations for roadway
embankment material.

The Texas Antiquities Code applies to this investigation since the NTTA and TxDOT,
which is a project sponsor, are public entities. Furthermore, since the site is located
within the Trinity River’s floodplain, it falls within the purvey of the Fort Worth District
of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The Dallas Floodway land where the site is located
is public land and owned by the City of Dallas. The Archeology Division of the THC will
not only review this report as the state agency but also as part of their Section 106 review
process. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of

1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93291).
This report was written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the THC,
Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (ND). The
following chapters present a brief description of the natural and cultural environmental
resources of the area. The research design and methodology and then the results of the
field investigation follow. The last chapter titled recommendations concludes the body of
the report. A list of references cited follows.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The natural environment of most of Dallas County has been characterized as being a
Blackland Prairie, which is rooted in the underlying Cretaceous limestones and shales.
The Trinity River, and its tributaries, cut through the relatively soft bedrock formations
and formed valleys and ultimately created depositional terraces over years of flooding.
The drainages provided water and floodplain soils and supported narrow zones of trees
and a variety of other plants. The prairie and the floodplain forest zones offered a variety
of habitats that were occupied by numerous mammals, fish, reptiles, and birds.
The Trinity River’s floodplain consists of Recent and Quaternary alluvium which is
underlain by the Upper Cretaceous-aged Austin Chalk (Bureau of Economic Geology
1972). Soils within the study area are part of the Trinity-Frio Soil Association which
consists of deep, nearly level floodplain clays (Coffee et al 1980:General Soils Map). The
specific soil is frequently flooded Trinity clay, which is a deep poorly drained soil found
in recent alluvium on floodplains (Coffee et al 1980:67-68).
In the past, a floodplain forest containing dense stands of trees lined the entrenched
valleys and extended as narrow bands along the valleys that originated in the uplands.
Today’s urban setting is not representative of the native vegetation, because many of the
forests have been cut down and trees have been planted or have become established in the
upland areas, which formerly were short-grass prairies. The tributary valleys are lined
primarily with elm, hackberry, and some cottonwoods. Undergrowth consists of grasses
and vines, including poison ivy, wild grapes, and greenbriars. Forests of the terraces and
floodplains include elm, cottonwood, and several mast-bearing tree species such as oak,
walnut, and pecan. The understory is similar to that described above.
Inhabiting these tree-lined drainages, terraces, and floodplain forests were diverse animal
populations. The larger mammals, such as deer, are infrequently found today. Instead, it
is the smaller mammals, such as raccoons, rabbits, beavers, skunks, moles, mice, and
squirrels that are abundant. Reptiles and amphibians, such as turtles (snapping turtles and
mud turtles), lizards, snakes, salamanders, toads, and frogs, inhabit most of the still water
areas that line the river. Dallas is along one of the major north/south bird migration routes
and in the spring and fall, there are birds of all types present that take advantage of the

floodplain/terrace resources of food and water. Temporary inhabitants include
hummingbirds, geese, ducks, swallows, and warblers. Permanent avian inhabitants
include doves, hawks, kites, owls, sparrows, herons, egrets, and ducks. The fish
population is comprised primarily of catfish, minnow, carp, sunfish, perch, and bass, to
name a few.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN THE
TRINITY RIVER FLOODPLAIN
In truth, very little archaeology has been conducted in the immediate study areas of the
Trinity Parkway route alternatives, although numerous studies in the surrounding area,
particularly downstream, demonstrate the presence of potentially significant historic and
prehistoric site deposits in some settings which are similar to those included within the
study area corridors. Virtually no substantive archaeological investigations occurred in
the floodplain of the Trinity River between the junction of the West Fork and the Elm
Fork and the eastern edge of Dallas county before 1980. Although limited in scope, most
investigations in the area have been conducted in the last ten years.
This paucity of information, as well as the discovery of a few buried sites in the Elm Fork
of the Trinity, led to the prediction that the floodplain of the Trinity River in Dallas had a
“high” potential for containing prehistoric archaeological sites (Skinner, Richner, and
Johnston 1978: Figure 23). Prior to 1980, it was believed that the river terraces had an
even higher potential for archaeological sites and that the tributaries and the uplands had
medium and low potential, respectively. Although a more careful review of historic maps
would have highlighted the fact that the current river alignment in the study area was not
the pre-levee channel, we had no appreciation of the geomorphological variability within
the floodplain, and thus equated the floodplain with similar settings on other river
tributaries. This understanding was further supported by the reported discovery of buried
sites, or apparently buried sites, in the vicinity of the Central Wastewater Treatment
Plant. As discussed elsewhere (Skinner 2001) and later in this report, the floodplain of the
Trinity in Dallas is no longer considered a monolithic “high probability” area.
In 1981, a team from Environment Consultants, Inc. (Bennett 1981) conducted a survey
of the proposed Dallas Floodway Extension, which begins just downstream from the
study area and continues downstream beyond Interstate Highway 20. The survey area
included the lower reaches of White Rock Creek and Five Mile Creek. This surface
survey recorded prehistoric site deposits on terrace deposits overlooking the Trinity
floodplain, along with historic standing structures and historic archaeological site
deposits. Shovel testing and backhoe excavations were not part of this investigation. At
the time, it was recommended that several of these sites warranted further investigation in
order to assess site significance for consideration in the NRHP.
In 1982, Archaeological Survey Associates (Kozloff and Bruseth 1982) conducted
surveys of proposed park sites for Dallas County, Department of Public Works. At that
time, they investigated a park site that extended from the mouth of Elam Creek south
along McCommas Bluff. The park was then known as Trinity River Park. Much of the
park property is situated in the floodplain and no prehistoric or historic archaeological
sites were found in this setting. Prehistoric sites had previously been recorded near the
park boundary, but each of these sites was located on the surface of the terrace sediments
that overlie the upland bedrock overlooking the floodplain. The only site recorded in the
floodplain was Lock and Dam No. 1 below McCommas Bluff which was recommended

for inclusion in the NRHP (Kozloff and Bruseth 1982:18). The site is also included, along
with a 1905 photograph, in an article about Metroplex floodplain sites (Reese, Pegues,
and Yates 1988).
In 1983, ARC conducted research with regard to the planned redevelopment of the
Neuhoff Bros. packing plant site on Stemmons Freeway. The 9.5 acre site had been the
location of a City of Dallas dump in the late 1800s and early 1900s, before it became the
site of a meat packing operation. The dump was situated on the end of a projection of the
upland bedrock that projected into the Trinity River floodplain. The dump contained a
stratified deposit dating as early as 1895 at a depth of 7-8 feet below the ground surface.
The lower deposit was three to four feet thick and contained artifacts dated between
1895-1917. This lower zone was overlaid by 6 inches to 2 feet of black fill, brick, and
some ash – probably the residue from the clearing of a burned building. The next layer
ranged from 6 to 18 inches in thickness and contained ash, bricks, concrete, bottles, and
metal pieces dated between 1915-1930. A two foot thick layer of black clayey fill capped
the deposit. This development never materialized and no further archaeological or
archival evaluation of the property was conducted (AR Consultants 1983).
As part of planning for developments in the Upper Trinity River Basin, C. Reid Ferring
and a team from North Texas State University (Yates and Ferring 1986) inventoried
cultural resources in the immediate river area [up to the 500 year flood elevation]
primarily within Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant Counties. This investigation was conducted
for the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. A reconnaissance and
inventory of archaeological sites within the area were conducted and significant emphasis
was placed on reconstructing the Late Quaternary geology and environments of the
region. Of particular interest is the compilation of boring logs from the White Rock
Creek area which show deeply buried Late Quaternary deposits that have the potential for
containing prehistoric archaeological deposits. This investigation and interest in the area
resulted in another publication by Ferring (1990) and the expansion of a chapter on
historic archaeology that included descriptions of sites, including Lock and Dam No. 1,
downstream from the Trinity Parkway study area (Reese, Pegues, and Yates 1988).
Site Y-41DL18 is a mixed Archaic and Late Prehistoric archaeological site located on
and in the upper part of the first terrace deposits of the Trinity River just downstream
from the Forest Avenue crossing of the Trinity River. The site had been monitored for
more than fifteen years by Bill Young (1998) who reported finding evidence of probably
Archaic burials in backdirt at the site. He reports a wide variety of cultural materials from
his surface collecting at the site, but was unable to locate any undisturbed cultural
features, burials, or even distinct cultural horizons. This is one of few remaining site
deposits located in first terrace sediments along the Trinity River that may contain some
intact archaeological deposits.
In conjunction with construction of the John F. Kennedy Exhibit addition to the Dallas
County Administration Building, archaeological excavations in Dallas’ Block 10/13 were
conducted by the Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University in the
winter of 1987-88 (Jurney and Andrews 1994). This was the first recorded archaeology to

be done in the Central Business District, and served to identify building remnants,
support structures, and material culture beginning in the late 1840s or early 1850s and
extending into the first decade of the railroad’s presence in Dallas in the 1870s. This
excavation demonstrated that buried evidence of mid-1800s Dallas remains buried in
some areas in the higher river terraces, even in downtown Dallas. Limited deep testing
indicated that dispersed prehistoric deposits may be present in the terrace sediments.
In the summer of 1990, ARC relocated two prehistoric archaeological sites in conjunction
with construction of the Rochester Park Levee east of Central Expressway, north and
west of the intersection of the Trinity River and White Rock Creek (Skinner, Young, and
Whorton 1990a and b). Both sites are situated on the edge of the first terrace of the
Trinity River. Testing at site 41DL70 failed to find a significant buried deposit and the
geomorphological evaluation was that the remaining deposit is in a derived condition. No
further work was recommended at the site. Limited testing of site 41DL69, which is also
designated as Y-41DL18 by William L. Young (1988), determined that the site had
suffered significant impacts in the past, but may contain buried deposits that are in place
and make the site potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Beginning in the summer of 1991, ARC conducted an assessment of archaeological sites
adjacent to and downstream from the Central Waste Water Treatment Plant (Skinner,
Whorton, and Young 1991). In the course of this investigation, two previously
unrecorded prehistoric archaeological sites were recorded as was the historic Miller’s
Ferry Bridge over the Trinity. Subsequent monitoring during construction resulted in the
recording of five additional prehistoric sites in the area (Skinner and Whorton 1995).
These five sites appeared to consist of small and ephemeral deposits contained in the
floodplain sediments that had been deposited near the river channel over a lengthy period
of time in the prehistoric past.
In the early 1990s, the Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University
conducted monitoring of bridge construction across the Trinity River floodplain just
upstream from the existing Santa Fe Railroad bridge (Archaeology Research Program
1991; Adovasio 1992). This monitoring failed to locate any evidence of buried historic or
prehistoric deposits in the floodplain between the levees. Monitoring the excavation of
footings and inspecting the effluent resulting from pier augering was difficult but did
result in a reconstruction of the subsurface sediment stratigraphy and the recognition of
buried soil horizons.
In the winter of 1993, a pedestrian survey of two tracts making up the proposed Little
Lemmon Lake Park was done for the Dallas County Park and Open Space Program
(Skinner and Whorton 1993). The survey found no evidence of prehistoric deposits on the
surface of the floodplain and was unable to relocate a previously recorded site located
near the south end of Little Lemmon Lake. This site had been reported as having been in
one of the numerous gravel borrow pits that are present in this part of the floodplain. A
previously unrecorded buried prehistoric archaeological site consisting of what appeared
to be parts of a possibly articulated bison skeleton was found in the river bank. The

second site was the historic Wulschleger Farm, which was a truck farm that provided
vegetables to the Dallas Farmers Market after World War II.
Between July of 1995 and March 21, 1997, ARC monitored trench excavation of the
West Bank Relief Interceptor Project, Phases II & III, which is a 120 inch diameter
pipeline built by Dallas Water Utilities (Trask, Whorton, and Skinner 1997). The pipeline
route is on the south side of the Trinity River floodplain between the Central Waste
Water Treatment Plant on the southeast and the Interstate Highway 30 crossing of the
Trinity River on the west. The construction corridor for the project was 100 feet wide and
16,771 feet long. The pipe trench averaged about thirty feet deep and was excavated into
the bedrock in places. The floodplain clays from the I-30 Trinity River overpass to east of
the I-35E overpass had a low potential to contain archaeological sites. The bedrock
exposures first noted east of the I-35E overpass and continuing to east of the Martin
Luther King Boulevard overpass were considered to have a medium potential. The gravel
bars and creek crossing situated on top of the bedrock appeared to have a high potential.
Because the only evidence of terrace-like deposits was at Cedar Creek, particular
attention was paid to the examination of the exposures and excavated back dirt, but no
buried cultural resources were observed.
In 1995 and 1996, ARC monitored the Phase I widening of the channelized Trinity River
channel extending upstream from the DART bridge to the Interstate 35E crossing of the
river (Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996). No evidence of prehistoric occupation was
uncovered in the floodplain sediments, but two historic sites were discovered and
recorded. Neither site would have been located by pedestrian survey and standard shovel
testing. The first site, 41DL370, was a hand-dug and brick-lined well associated with
trash dated approximately 1940. The second site was also an early 1900s trash
accumulation containing an abundance of marine oyster shells.
In 1995, ARC conducted deep testing using a trackhoe upstream from the axis of the
DART bridge over the Trinity River floodplain (Skinner, Whorton, Trask, Scott, Caran,
and Dillon 1996:140-174). As with the construction monitoring previously done by the
Archaeology Research Program, no buried cultural materials were found in the profiles of
the eleven trenches and two profiles that were investigated. Although the possibility of
buried archaeological deposits was recognized by the geomorphologists (Caran and
Dillon 1996), none were isolated. It was noted that deep testing in floodplain sediments in
the Trinity River floodplain poses limitations due to sediment instability.
In the fall of 1997, ARC evaluated buried deposits contained in the area where the
downtown TU Electric power plant was located and where American Airlines Arena was
being built (Skinner 1997). Although prehistoric artifacts previously were recovered from
this general area by Bill Young, no prehistoric site deposits were found during backhoe
trenching. A historic trash deposit was found but was water-logged. Due to the mixed
contexts of the historic artifacts contained in this part of the old City of Dallas dump,
their collection would not have provided contexts useful for historic sites archaeology.

In 1997, Geo-Marine, Inc. reevaluated 41 archaeological sites previously located within
or adjacent to the APE for the proposed Dallas Floodway Extension between Corinth
Street and Interstate Highway 20 (Cliff, Hunt, Prior, Gaither, and Autin 1998); fourteen
of these sites are within the floodway footprint. Six of the fourteen sites were considered
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP due to heavy disturbance. The remaining eight sites
were recommended to be considered eligible for NRHP inclusion pending further
investigations. Several of these buried prehistoric sites were recommended for inclusion
as macro-sites or site clusters. It also was recommended that an abandoned City of Dallas
dump, site 41DL320, retained some research potential. Forty-nine architectural resources
were recorded within the APE, and it was recommended that three require assessment by
an architectural historian and three others would require this assessment when they
become fifty years old. The remaining 43 resources did not warrant further investigation.
In the summer of 1999, ARC monitored Phase 2 of the Trinity River Channel Widening
which extended from east of the Interstate Highway 35E bridge to west of the Continental
Avenue bridge (Skinner 2001). No in-place prehistoric or historic archaeological sites
were found. Regular inspection revealed that the top of the pre-levee floodplain is located
from one to three meters below the present ground surface. Furthermore, this upper
sediment contains historic materials, particularly fill dirt along with various construction
materials that were deposited over the floodplain, probably since levee construction.
Monitoring recorded the presence of a buffalo or cow skeleton and recovered a cluster of
weak-side broken fresh-water mussel shells (Todd 1999). The age of the animal skeleton
is uncertain. Due to the breakage of the mussel shells, it was concluded that they were
opened prehistorically.
In 1999, Geo-Marine, Inc. did a reconnaissance and deep probe testing in the floodplains
of the East Fork, West Fork and within the Dallas Floodway (Cliff, Shannabrook, Hunt,
Autin and Prior 1999). Although no buried cultural resources were found during their
testing they recognized there was strong potential along the remnant channel of the West
Fork between Inwood and Westmoreland Roads.
In 2006, ARC (Frederick, Trask and Skinner 2006) excavated 41 backhoe trenches within
the Trinity River floodplain for the proposed Trinity Parkway, which is proposed to be
constructed by the NTTA. The testing generally resulted in the absence of buried cultural
deposits and the presence of modern trash, borrow pits and other disturbances. However,
two sites (41DL4440 and 41DL441) were recorded. Site 41DL440 consists of an early
20th century trash accumulation and site 41DL441 consists of a Protohistoric-aged hearth.
Charcoal from the hearth dated to 170+40 BP (Beta 216210) and charcoal from a nearby
location returned a date of 230±40 BP (Beta 216209). ARC recommended that the site be
tested to determine its eligibility to the NRHP.
Past investigations in the study area have shown that prehistoric sites are more prominent
and recognizable on the terraces adjacent to the floodplain. Sites in these settings have
generally been eroded and bioturbated, thus reducing the potential of finding features and
artifacts in primary contexts. Historic sites have been found in the floodplain both along
the river channel, such as Lock and Dam No. 1 downstream at McCommas Bluff and the

two historic sites dated in the 1900s and recorded during the Phase 1 widening of the
Trinity River channel upstream from the Corinth Street Viaduct and in the center of the
study area. Early maps indicate that the floodplain was used primarily for farming prior
to construction of the levees and river channelization, and these farming activities may
have led to the construction of the brick-lined well located during the channel widening
project.

METHODOLOGY
The primary purpose of testing site 41DL441 was to determine its eligibility to the
NRHP.
In order to do so, a trench was excavated to uncover the site and expose any artifacts that
might be present. After that, three additional trenches were dug perpendicular to the
discovery trench at 5 meter intervals. These trenches were excavated to a meter deeper
than that of the hearth and surrounding charcoal. The trenches were 10 meters long and
stair-stepped according to OSHA standards. A fourth trench was excavated perpendicular
to the above three trenches to unite the three trenches. The backdirt from each trench and
the trench walls were visually examined for cultural materials.
For each trench, the profile was described in general accordance with the methods
advocated by Schoeneberger, Wysocki, Benham and Broderson (2002). We also
endeavored to link the exposed alluvial deposits with previously published studies on the
Trinity River stratigraphy (e.g. Ferring 1990, 1994) and published work done in this
specific area (Cliff, Shannabrook, Hunt, Austin and Prior 1999; Cliff, Hunt, Prior,
Gaither and Austin 1998; Ferring 2000).

RESULTS
In this portion of the report, the original description of site 41DL441 is presented as well
as the recent investigation with backhoe trenches and plots in Figure 3. Conclusions from
the recent investigation end the chapter.
2006 Testing - Site 41DL441 and the Stratigraphy of the Old West Fork Channel
Trenches T34 and T35 exposed what appeared to be a Pilot Point age channel fill, and
this may be the same deposit logged by Geo-Marine in their Trench WF3. The orientation
of the southern edge of this channel, as exposed by Trench 34, suggested to us that it is
oriented northeast-southwest in this location, but more work is necessary to pin down its
location. What is clear is that the fill of this channel is distinctly different from that
exposed by Trenches 31 and 32. Trench 36 was placed to the west of Trench 34 and
revealed a typical exposure of the West Fork soil overlain by a thin drape (~85 cm) of
Recent Alluvium. To the north of the paleochannel, closer to the rectified channel of the
Trinity, Trench 33 revealed about 1.5 m of mechanically deposited earthen fill,
sandwiched between recent alluvial deposits. Finally, Geo-Marine borehole WF4, located

immediately adjacent to the modern Trinity River channel, revealed a strange suite of
deposits consisting of 4 m of recent to very late Holocene levee deposits on top of the
Aubrey alluvium and Carrolton alluvium. The Pilot Point alluvium and the West Fork
Soil were not recorded here.
During excavation of T34, we also discovered what appeared to be a single hearth in the
east wall (Figure 2). Two charcoal samples were extracted from the hearth proper and at
the location marked “Charcoal” in Figure 2. Results from the material sent to Beta
Analytic for dating returned a date of 170± 40 BP [1886 AD] for the hearth and 230±40
BP [1796 AD] for the charcoal.
The trench profile and sides were closely examined for cultural artifacts that could be
associated with the hearth. Unfortunately none were found. With the discovery of this
somewhat discreet feature adjacent to the old river channel two more backhoe trenches
were excavated nearby. Trenches 35 and 36, discussed above were placed in close
proximity to Trench 34 in order to explore for other features or artifacts that could be
associated with the hearth. Trench 35, placed approximately 7 m to the NE and parallel to
the old channel, was negative and Trench 36, placed approximately 15 m to the NW and
slightly perpendicular to Trench 34, was negative as well.
Considered together, the results of our trenching of not only T34 but surrounding
trenches and Geo-Marine’s coring reveal the stratigraphy in this area to be surprisingly
complex, in part owing to the presence of what may be more than one late Holocene
channel deposit, inset into the Pilot Point alluvial floodplain, and the presence of spoil
introduced by recent earth work.
The trench description and comments for T34 are presented below in Table 1, and a
graphic representation of the trench is presented in Figure 2.

East wall profile of Trench 34 showing deposition zones, hearth and
charcoal. Note the steeply dipping interface between Zones 4 and 5 thought
to be the southern edge of a paleochannel. From Frederick et al (2006:43).

This trench revealed a thin drape of Recent alluvium resting on a channel fill within the
Pilot Point alluvium. The trench exposed the southern shoulder of the channel feature,
and a burnt earth feature presumed to be a hearth was observed buried near the top of the
channel fill deposit but beneath the recent alluvium. The hearth was situated at the point
where the ground started to drop off into the topographic depression (swale) defined by
the channel. The radiocarbon ages obtained from this feature and scattered charcoal near
it provide some support for the field interpretation that this could be a Protohistoric
occupation, but calibration of both ages indicate that there is a chance that they may be of
20th century.
Recent Investigation
Excavation with a backhoe began at the location logged with a Global Positioning
System (GPS) during the original survey (Figure 3). The first trench uncovered what was

thought to be part of a trench from previous excavations because the backdirt consisted of
mixed peds from different horizons. No discernable old trench walls were found and the
trench was abandoned. The next trench, placed approximately 4 meters to the northeast
found undisturbed soil. Excavation continued and at 60 cm below the surface (cmbs)
some charcoal, ash, and burned clay were exposed in the trench floor and the west wall.
Mechanical excavation was halted. Excavation with a trowel revealed a thin layer of ash
approximately 5 mm thick, some charcoal, and a piece of broken clear bottle glass
(Figure 4). At the west edge of the trench was burned clay. A check of the GPS location
confirmed that this hearth was the one first exposed in Trench 34 in 2006. Careful
clearing around the exposed ash and charcoal found it measured 32 cm N/S by 44 cm
E/W and extended slightly into the west wall of the trench. As stated earlier, the ash and
charcoal was 5 mm thick and it was determined that the burned clay in the west trench
wall was the hearth remnant found in the previous testing of Trench T34.
The shard of clear bottle glass measured 4.5 x 3.5 x 4 mm thick and was caked on both
sides with ash, soil, and charcoal specks. Because the glass shard had no identifying
marks, there was no way to get an absolute date of manufacture. The original testing
submitted two samples for dating; the first was from the hearth proper and the second
was from a loci of charcoal believed to be associated with the hearth. The first sample
from the hearth returned a date of 170±40 BP (1886 AD) and 230±40 BP (1796 AD) for
the loci sample. The glass shard discovered during this excavation would suggest that the
dates for the hearth and charcoal are more in the range of 1928 and 1838, respectively.
No other artifacts were recovered.
The single glass shard mixed with the ash, yet not altered by heat, means it was deposited
when the hearth had gone cold. Yet it was shortly after the hearth was cold because it was
within the ash and not on top of it. The single shard would suggest the rest of the glass
was deposited somewhere else. The subsequent clay deposits on top of the hearth and
shard reflect the type of fluvial environment the site was subjected to. That environment
can be described as one where sediment, in this case clay, was deposited in layers over
time. During the deposition of these layers, there was not enough stream power to
dislodge the shard giving credence to the theory that the other shards were deposited
elsewhere.
It is unlikely that river flooding was the agent for the removal of the other shards. This is
based on the types of flood episodes that subsequently buried the hearth. These flood
episodes are the type where water rises and falls with enough power to deposit heavier
sediments than silt, in this case clays, yet do not have enough strength to dislodge the
shard or disperse the ash. Typical Trinity River floods are events where the water rises
and falls slowly, with the rise and fall dictated by volume of water. An atypical Trinity
River flood is the type where a wall of water moves down channel with enough power to
dislodge objects. These types of flood events are rare and were not noted in the trench
descriptions in and around the site. The trench descriptions from the 2008 testing are
presented in Table 2.

Due to the discovery of the hearth during the 2008 testing, the original proposed
excavation method was not followed; instead a plan to discover other hearths or artifacts
was implemented. That plan involved excavating an area around the original hearth away
from the bank of the unnamed tributary (Figure 3). Successive backhoe trenches (Figure
3 and Table 2) failed to uncover further buried cultural materials or features within the
floodplain deposits. Approximately 108 square meters of dirt was excavated during the
2008 testing of site 41DL441. At the end of the trenching, the trenches were backfilled.
During the backfilling process, the dirt was compacted so that the land could be returned
to its original level as much as possible.
Conclusions
Trenching by backhoe to relocate Site 41DL441 were successful. Trench 2 exposed the
hearth originally found in Trench 34. The glass shard found within the ash lens means the
hearth is historic in origin. The single artifact of a clear shard of bottle glass, along with
the ash and flecks of charcoal implies that 41DL441 was the location for a single event: a
campfire at the banks of a tributary of the West Fork of the Trinity River. During that
single episode, a bottle was broken and a single shard of that bottle landed in the now
cold embers of the campfire. The lack of disfigurement of the glass means the shard
landed there when the fire had died and was not hot enough to alter the glass in any way.
Flooding covered the site with sediment until it was exposed in 2006 and 2008.
This site was recorded during the original testing for this project in 2006 (Frederick et
al:42). When it was first exposed, the lack of artifacts in and around the hearth was a
problem as the only way to get a date was from the charcoal and the burned clay. The
lack of artifacts was thought to be because the site either 1) represented a single event
(i.e. a campfire for a single day or night) or 2) was not associated with human activity
and was the result of a log burning in place and burning the ground as well.
Trenching in 2008 confirmed the site was a single event early in Dallas’ history. The lack
of datable artifacts and other features means the site is not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP or as an SAL.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on results of the testing, AR Consultants, Inc., recommends that the North Texas
Tollway Authority can proceed with construction activities in and around site 41DL441
without the need for further cultural resource investigations.
