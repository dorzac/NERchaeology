INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates was retained by the City of Bryan through
CSC Engineering & Environmental Consultants, Inc. to conduct a Phase I cultural
resources survey of a proposed sewer line and lift station (approximately 211 acres)
that will service the Tradition Golf and Country Club at University Ranch in central
Brazos County (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on United States Geological
Survey (USGS) topographical map Chances Store dated 1962 and photorevised 1980
(Figure 2). The sewer line parallels Turkey Creek and one of its tributaries and
connects with the site of the lift station on a sandy hill overlooking a bend of Turkey
Creek (Figure 2). The sewer line will be placed in a 10-15 foot deep trench with a width
of 6 feet. A permanent utility easement of 15 feet will be retained on either side of the
centerline. The lift station will be approximately 50 x 50 feet in size.
Based on an examination of the route of the sewer line and probable location of
the lift station as depicted on the topographic map, parts of the project area were
considered to be medium to high probability areas in terms of containing significant
prehistoric and/or historic sites, thereby warranting an archaeological survey. Since a
local municipality will finance the construction of this project, an Antiquities Permit was
required, and permit number 2498 was assigned to this project. The field survey was
accomplished on November 26 and 27, 2000 and February 13-15, 2001. In all, 96
person hours were necessary to complete the field survey portion of this project.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acidic sandy loams or
sands. The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for the county is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees and a July maximum temperature of 95 degrees
combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180). The
altitude varies from 200-400 feet. No soils book is currently available for Brazos County.
Soils data were obtained from the local field office of the Natural Resources
Conservation Service in Bryan. Specific soil types encountered in the project area are
discussed in the Results and Conclusions section of this report.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
A check of the records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no archeological sites have been recorded within the current
project area. It was discovered that significant sites have been recorded in Brazos
County. Prehistoric sites in this area are typically found on sandy ridges and uplands in
close proximity to dependable sources of water such as creeks and rivers. No
prehistoric sites in the county have been reported on clay hills or in active floodplains.
During a recent survey of the Tradition Golf and Country Club at University
Ranch (Moore 2000) one previously unrecorded prehistoric site with a historic
component (41BZ131) and three previously unrecorded prehistoric sites (41BZ132 41BZ134) were recorded. All of the prehistoric sites were situated in a deep sandy
mantle and considered not significant by the Texas Historical Commission. These sites
are located on sandy hills overlooking Turkey Creek and its tributaries in an adjacent
tract to the northeast.
Brazos County also contains sites of historical significance. The Richard Carter
site (41BZ74) represents the earliest historic settlement in the county at circa 1831
(Carlson 1983, 1987). The town of Boonville (41BZ91), including Boonville Cemetery,
was the first county seat of Brazos County and was established in 1841 (Webb
1952:188).

FIELD METHODS
The project area was first examined on November 26 and 27, 2000. At that time
the proposed sewer line and lift station were in a location that was different from the
currently proposed alignment. Because of landowner and access issues, the field
survey was delayed until February when the site of the sewer line and lift station had
been moved to its current location. On February 13-15, 2001, the field crew returned to
the project area and conducted a pedestrian survey.
The entire route was walked by the field crew and examined by shovel tests and
probes. Prior to the field survey, sections of the sewer line route were considered to be
medium to high probability areas for the presence of archaeological sites. This
assessment was based on the route as depicted on the topographic map. However, in
the field it was discovered that most of the sewer line route was in low-lying, frequently
flooded areas adjacent to the creek. One hill that appeared to be a good location on the
topographic map contained very shallow soils over dense red clay found by shovel
probing to be about 20 cm below the sandy stratum. Except for one low sandy hill along
the sewer line that was shovel tested, this area was examined by visual inspection and
shovel probes. Shovel probes were used to identify areas where clay was at or very
near the surface. Probes differ from tests in that they are not screened. Shovel tests
were concentrated in areas where sandy soil was present, with the main concentration
in the area of the proposed lift station. The location of the lift station as depicted on the
topographic map (Figure 2) is approximate. Therefore, all sandy hills adjacent to the lift
station and in the immediate vicinity were tested. Shovel tests were dug to clay when
possible. The size of each test was 30 x 50 cm and varied in depth from 15 to 100 cm
below the existing ground surface. All excavated fill was screened through 1/4 inch
hardware cloth. Data obtained from shovel testing were recorded on a shovel test log
(Appendix I). In all, 25 shovel tests were dug. Fourteen tests were excavated in the
vicinity of the proposed lift station, and 11 tests were excavated along the sewer line in
sandy areas. The rest of the area was examined by visual inspection and shovel
probes (n=20).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been recorded in the project area. There was also
no indication that any part of the project area had been surveyed by professional
archaeologists. The records search revealed the presence of prehistoric and historic
utilization in the area (see Archaeological Background above) as evidenced by
prehistoric sites in the adjacent golf course tract, the nearby town of Boonville (1841),
and the Richard Carter homestead (circa 1830s).
As stated above, most of the route of the sewer line follows the main channel of
Turkey Creek and a tributary much of which is in low lying, frequently flooded areas.
The entire route of the sewer line is viewed as very low probability for archaeological
sites. Several sandy hills were observed in the area of the proposed lift station. Shovel
tests and examination of exposed cutbanks did not produce any cultural materials.
According to the soils sheet, seven soils are present in the project area (Figure 3).
These are Chazos loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent slopes (ChC), Gredge fine sandy
loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (GrC), Gredge fine sandy loam, 5 to 8 percent slopes (GrD),
Robco loamy fine sand, 1 to 3 percent slopes (RoB), Sandow loam, frequently flooded
(Sa) and Uhland loam, frequently flooded (Uh), and Zack fine sandy loam, 5 to 8
percent slopes (ZaD).

RECOMMENDATIONS

8

It is the opinion of Brazos Valley Research Associates that there are no
archaeological sites within the current project area. Therefore, it is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible that archaeological
sites are missed during any cultural resources survey. Should areas containing
prehistoric or historic artifacts not discussed in this report be discovered during
construction, the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission, must be notified
immediately and all work stopped in the area of concern until the situation can be
evaluated.
