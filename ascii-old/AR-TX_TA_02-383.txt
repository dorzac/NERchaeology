Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of the proposed 27549 West
27th Street Tower Site and a 400-meter access/utility right-of-way in central Smith County,
Texas. The Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA;
47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an
undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological
report was provided by the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeology Division. The total area
to be impacted is 2,500 square feet (0.06 acres), in addition to a 20-foot wide by 400-meter long
(1,312 feet) access and utility easement right-of-way (0.60 acres).
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted the survey on January 19, 2016. A thorough
pedestrian survey of the surface areas was conducted before 14 shovel tests were excavated. No
evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural materials was found either on or below the
surface.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the monopole tract and right-of-way as planned. However, Tierras
Antiguas further recommended that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were
encountered during development, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds could be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Project Setting
The Project Area lies in
northeast Texas, within the
central area of Smith County
(see Figure 1), within the East
Texas Timberlands region, and
which as shown in Figure 4 is
within the broader area defined
as the Interior Coastal Plain.
In this area of the Texas
Timberlands Region, fine sands
and fine sandy loams overlay
Quaternary-age interbedded
sandy clays. Elevation in Smith
County ranges from 300 to 600
feet above mean sea level
(Fenneman 1931; Groat 1965;
McCrosky 1996).
The modern climate of the
Smith County area can be
classified as warm and moist,
with moist tropical air emanating

from the Gulf of Mexico
(http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg).
covering the area. The end result
is often long and hot summers, but with generally cool and fairly short winters. Large fluctuations
in temperature occur throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from an average high
of 95 degrees during the Summer to around 33 degrees in the Winter. The average annual
precipitation is about 44 inches, though significant fluctuations are common. Post Oak, blackjack
oak, and tall grasses cover roughly 2/3 of the Smith County area, while the remaining 1/3 is
heavily forested pines and hardwoods (Hatherly 1993; McCrosky 1996).
Hydrology
Two rivers form portions of the boundary of modern-day Smith County. The Neches River flows
along its western edge, and the Sabine River runs along its northern edge. Lake Palestine was
created by the construction of the Blackburn Crossing Dam across the Neches River in 1962.
Besides the Neches, runoff from the Kickapoo Creek basin also empties into Lake Palestine. Lake
Tyler (west) was created by the damming of Prairie Creek, and Lake Tyler East was created when
a dam was built across Mud Creek in 1966. Otherwise, numerous drainages, low lying swamp
areas, and ponds are prevalent throughout the county.

Soils
Soils across the county range from sandy prairie loams in the northwest and east, to loams over
clay in other parts (Hatherly 1993). A review of county soils maps and publications both online
and in hard copy format indicates that the construction of the 27549 West 27th Street Tower Site
and Access/Utility Easement Right-of-Way will impact three different soil classifications. The
characteristics of these soil classifications offer varying depths, sedimentation, and deposition
rates. As such, the soils in the area likewise imply the potential for the preservation of intact
cultural resources to exist. Figure 5 shows the tower site and access/utility right-of-way through
these soil areas, and they are briefly described below (Hatherly 1993; Web Soil Survey 2016).

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
Smith County is located in the northern portion of the Northeast Texas archaeological region.
Formal archaeological research in Northeast Texas can be traced to the 1930s when a number of
sites and cemeteries of prehistoric age were excavated by the University of Texas (Pearce 1932;
Jackson 1934, 1934). Since that time, most of the archaeological sites within the region have been
recorded either by avocational archaeologists, or as the result of professional surveys and
excavations during large-scale reservoir and lignite mine projects. All dates given in the following
5

discussion are approximate and given as years before present (B.P.), i.e, before A.D. 1950 when
radiocarbon analysis was refined.
Paleoindian Period
This period spans the period estimated at between 11,500-7950 B.P. in the Pineywoods of
Northeast Texas (Perttula 2004). The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the
Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early Paleoindian interval (ca. 11,500-10,00 B.P.) include
Clovis points and elongated blades expediently used as tools. Discoveries of Paleoindian artifacts
in Northeast Texas suggest that these early inhabitants of the region were tethered to major stream
basins and valleys.
In general, the early Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of
nomadic, big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth,
mastodons, bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis
has been placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early
Americans (Fields and Tomka 1993:82), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers,
and raccoons (Collins 2004; Collins and Brown 2000), although they undoubtedly hunted the
large animals as well (Dibble and Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries,
caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Collins 2004).
As the warming trend that marked the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to
take effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift
is also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, and camel before
10,000 B.P., and giant bison (Bison antiquus) by 8,000 B.P. The descendants of Bison antiquus
have survived into modern times. During this late Paleoindian interval in Northeast Texas that can
be roughly dated to ca. 10,000-9000 B.P., stone tools such as Dalton, Plainview and various forms
of laneolate-shaped points and tools
Archaic Period (7950-2150 B.P.)
The Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods in Northeast Texas are poorly dated, but it is
generally accepted that the Early Archaic interval begins around 7950 B.P (Perttula 2004). The
extinction of large herds of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene
stimulated a behavioral change by the Prehistoric inhabitants. While the basic hunter-gatherer
adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. However, it appears that the small Indian groups of this period remained highly mobile,
moving frequently across the landscape hunting and foraging, but often returning to the same site
locations repeatedly, perhaps seasonally.
The Middle Archaic is characterized by larger sites in major basins in the region, a more diverse
hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the increased use of plant foods
as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features. Possible hearths, ovens and burned
rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and cooking of plant resources was important
6

(Perttula 2004). Valuable lithic raw material and tools were traded were likely exchanged across
the region (Fields and Tomka 1993:92).
Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic-period sites are relatively common along major
streams by springs in the uplands, and on tributary drainages. During the Late Archaic,
populationdensity may have peaked, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites
and greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread distribution
of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined territories, and
regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).
Woodland/Early Ceramic Period
The Woodland period (ca. [2150 B.P.] 200 BC–AD 800) is not well defined but is largely
identified by plain ware ceramics, tempered with clay/grog or bone, and by Gary projectile points.
At sites near the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while at other
sites in Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not as common.
One explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food processing and
diet during this period, all of which may have an effect on the degree of sedentism between
regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests that Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers
living in larger groups and settling in given locations for longer periods than they had during the
Archaic period. There are some instances (e.g., Skibo and Blinman 1999) in which pottery making
is linked to sedentism, perhaps giving reason for these long stays. In some cases, such as at the
Ray Site, small settlements with structures and middens suggest a more concentrated occupation,
but these sites are not as permanent as those seen at later Caddo-period sites in the region (Perttula
2004). With the exception of sites in the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina river basins, Woodland
sites are not very common throughout much of Northeast Texas, but when they occur, they are
represented by villages and hamlets in the floodplains or on terraces of larger streams, and also
by smaller components in the uplands. No Woodland-period burial mounds have been
documented in the region.
Formative Caddoan Period and Early Caddoan Period
Sites dating to the Formative Caddoan (ca. AD 800–1000) and Early Caddoan periods (ca. AD
1000–1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and smaller
tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were primarily
chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash, and native plants. Permanent settlements
that included structures, middens, pits, and cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and ceramics
were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads with
rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities, such as the George C. Davis Site on the Neches River, are also
encountered. These large villages are more common during the Early Caddoan period and
continue through the Middle Caddoan period, and include large groups of many structures, mound
7

centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and earspools, and
diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from Formative and Early
Caddoan sites (Perttula 2004).
Middle Caddoan Period
The majority of archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddoan period (ca. AD
1200–1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements with
multiple mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddoan period. One example of such a site is the
Oak Hill Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public structures.
Cultivation of maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence on maize and
other crops until after AD 1300 (Perttula 2004).
Late Caddoan Period
Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddoan period (ca. AD 1400–1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddoan sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches river basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddoanperiod
archeological sites are either large permanent communities, or smaller farmsteads, both with
associated cemeteries. Late Caddoan-period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily used
from AD 1400 to 1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction and mound shaft
burials continued until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and
bioarcheological evidence from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily
dependent on maize as their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddoan Titus phase (ca. AD 1430–1680) refers to the archeological remains of Caddo
peoples that lived in the northeastern portion of the Texas Piney Woods between the Sulphur and
Sabine rivers. These Caddo peoples lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society. They
constructed both small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with statusranked community cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titus Phase
sites are usually found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and
permanent settlements are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).
Historic Caddoan Period
Europeans in the region define the Historic Caddoan period (ca. AD 1680–1860) as the sustained
European presence in and occupation of the Caddoan area. It is during this period that the Caddo
and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were eventually moved
from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddoan settlements in the region were small
farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities were composed of
many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts recovered from these sites
include a wide variety of Caddoan ceramics, basketry, ornaments, and bone, stone, and wooden
8

tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddoan sites after ca. AD 1740 and
include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles, hatchets, knives, hoes,
lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

History of Northeast Texas Archaeological Region through the 19th Century
Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries
The Spaniards
In part to stifle French encroachment into east and northeast Texas, as well as to convert the
Caddo Indians (both Tejas and Kadohodahos) to Catholicism, the Spanish decided to establish
up to seven missions in what is now east Texas. In 1689 the first Spanish mission, Mission San
Francisco de los Tejas, was established west of the Neches River for the Tejas Indians near Alto
(Chipman 1992:89). Two years later, while isolated in east Texas, Fathers Bodoy and Jesús María
founded a second mission, Santismo Nombre de Maria, about five miles northeast of San
Francisco de los Tejas (Chipman 192:97). These missions were founded while Bodoy and Jesús
María were waiting for Father Massanét and Governor General Terán de los Rios to help establish
the other missions. Terán made it to the Kadohodachos, but the remaining missions were not
attempted. After that, Terán left Mission San Francisco and returned by ship to Vera Cruz, leaving
only “three religious and nine soldiers” at the missions (Chipman 1992:97-98). Hostile attacks
finally forced the demise of the mission, and after burying the mission bells and military cannon
at Mission San Francisco de los Tejas, the three padres remaining there set it on fire and fled back
toward Coahuila in 1693 (Chipman 1992:99).
Mission San Francisco was reestablished in 1716 for the Neches Indians and others, east of the
mission established in 1690 on the other side of the Neches River. It was renamed Nuestro Padre
San Francisco de los Tejas. In July 1716, Mission Señora de la Purisma Concepción was
established on the Angelina River, abut 15 miles west of Nacogdoches, to serve the Hainai
Indians. Later in July 1716, Mission Señora de Guadalupe was founded at present-day
Nacogdoches to serve the Nacogdoche tribe. Mission José de los Nazonis was established north
of modern-day Cushing in July 1716 to serve the Nazoni Indians. In early 1717, Mission Nuestra
Señora de los Dolores was established near modern-day San Augustine to serve the Ais Indians.
Also in early 1717, Mission San Miguel de los Adaes was established near modern-day Robeline,
Louisiana to serve the Adais Indians. In 1721, Governor San Miguel de Aguayo established
Presidio Señora de Pilar on the Red River in western Louisiana near Natchitoches and then refounded Presidio Delores near San Augustine to protect the six east Texas Indians (Chipman
1992:113-123).
In 1718, the first mission, Mission San Antonio de Valero, was established in San Antonio, and
José y San Miguel de Aguayo was established in 1720. On May 13, 1721, the new Governor San
Miguel de Aguayo crossed the Rio Grande with 500 men, 2,800 horses, 4,800 cattle, and 640
sheep and goats to supply Mission San José in San Antonio. He then departed for east Texas. His
was the first cattle drive through Texas, and the beginning of Spanish ranching in Texas
9

(Chipman 1992:121). However, by their own admission, early Spanish settlements in east Texas
produced only enough agricultural goods to feed themselves, most likely due to the remoteness
of the area and not because of a lack of rainfall or fertile soil (Chipman 1992:6). The remoteness,
reluctance of the Indians to stay in the missions, and disease led to the ultimate decline of the east
Texas missions, Finally, in July 1730, the Presidio de los Tejas was closed at the recommendation
of Father Miguel Sevillano de Paredes. Three east Texas missions, Señora de la Purisma
Concepción de Acuña, San Francisco de la Espada, and San Juan Capistrano, were also closed
and moved first to Barton Springs in Austin in July 1730, and then relocated to San Antonio from
March to May 1731 (Chipman 1992:131).
The English
After a disastrous sea battle between the English slave trader Sir John Hawkins and the Spanish
navy off the port of Vera Cruz in 1568, a crew of 114 that included David Ingram landed on
northern Mexico shores. They walked through Texas en route to Cape Breton off Nova Scotia,
but only three men survived. David Ingram eventually reported vast riches in land, minerlas, and
fur to the English authorities. Yet the English were wary of Spain’s dominance in the Gulf of
Mexico and would not attempt organized expeditions into Texas until after the end of the Seven
Years’ war and the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Although small numbers of Englishmen were reported
near Natchitoches and the Trinity River in 1772, the Spanish did not find them. However, they
did encounter Indians with English-made firearms. In 1775, on group of Englishmen farmed for
a season on the Neches River, possibly attempting colonization in northeast Texas, and in 1777
a boat loaded with bricks ran aground in the Neches (Cutrer 1985:7-12). These early activities by
the English did not result in permanent settlements in Texas.
The French
France’s first notable attempt at colonizing Texas came with the building of La Salle’s fort on
Garcitas Creek near Matagorda Bay in 1687 (Chipman 1992:79). The expedition was a failure and
La Salle was murdered in east Texas near the Trinity River in 1687 (Chipman 1992:84). The sixth
land expedition to look for LaSalle’s fort was led by Spanish explorer Alonso de León, Jr.,
accompanied by Father Damián Massanét. They found the ruins on April 22, 1689. They later
returned to the Fort St. Louis (La Salle’s fort) en route to establish a new mission (San Francisco
de los Tejas) in east Texas, and Father Massanét is the one alleged to have set fire to the ruins
(Chipman 1992:89). Frenchman Sieur d’ Pierre Lemoyne Iberville sailed into the mouth of the
Mississippi and established a French fort near modern-day Baton Rouge in April 1699, further
threatening Spain’s fledgling efforts to protect its interests in Texas (Chipman 1992:101).
Alliances were formed between early French traders and Native American tribes for economic
reasons during the first half of the eighteenth century. In an attempt to extend their trade network
from Louisiana to santa Fe, french traders sought peaceful relations and trade agreements with
Wichita villages in Oklahoma. The Wichitas provided valuable otter, mink, beaver, and muskrat
furs, as well as buffalo robes in exchange for French guns, ammunition, knives, cloth, and other
hardware (Morris 1970:79-80). In 1747, the French were instrumental in helping the Wichitas
form a trade alliance with the Comanches, who were encroaching on the western periphery of the
Wichita’s territory in modern-day western Oklahoma. The wide-ranging Comanches were able
10

to provide more furs from territories they controlled to the west. The Wichita acted as middlemen
in the French-Comanche trade; the Wichitas accepted Comanche furs in exchange for French
muskets and other goods. The Osage raids and hunting forays from Missouri into northeastern
Oklahoma occupied by the Taovaya, a band of the Wichitas, forced most of the Taovaya into
southeastern Oklahoma in 1757, joining other Wichita bands in the area and establishing Twin
Villages across the Red River from each other, in Jefferson County, Oklahoma and Montague
County, Texas. In response, a new French trading post was established at Natchitoches on the Red
River (Morris 1970:80-81).
The French/Wichita/Comanche alliance proved costly to both the French and Spanish. In 1758
the Comanche, Wichita, and tawakoni Indians (a Wichita group) attacked Mission San Sabá on
the San Saba River near present-day Menard in south-central Texas. The mission was established
at the request of the Apaches, enemies of the Comanches. The massacre of the mission inhabitants
by the Comanches and Wichitas was carried out with French muskets (Weddle 1964). In
retaliation, Spanish Colonel Diego Ortíz Parrila led an expedition into north Texas where he
enjoined the Wichitas in battle. His command was defeated and he retreated to San Antonio
(Chipman 1992:158-161). French and Spanish relations in Texas were strained from that time
forward. Across the Atlantic, however, Spain and France had forged a different relationship. In
return for Spain’s support of France in the Seven Years’ War, France ceded Louisiana to Spain
in 1763.
The Spanish wisely appointed Athanase De Mézières, a Frenchman, as the lieutenant governor
of Louisiana. De Mézières enforced Spanish laws against trading with the Indians for guns,
ammunition, horses, mules, and Indian slaves. This in effect curtailed the French and taovaya
Indian trade. Reluctantly, the Taovaya agreed to Spanish rule in 1771. De Mézières then allowed
Spanish traders access to the Taovaya at Twin Villages. However, the Taovaya preferred the guns,
horses, and mules that French traders could provide them, and trade with the French generally
increased. De Mézières countered by offering higher payments to the Taovaya for deer skins and
buffalo robes, which returned favored trading status to the Spanish. After De Mézières died in
1779, Spanish traders refused to pay the higher prices, and trade with the Taovaya effectively
ceased (Morris 1970:81).
Meanwhile, the Taovaya were harrassed by their dreaded Osage enemies. In 1782, gifts in the
form of guns, ammunition, and assorted sundry articles from the Spanish village of Nacogdoches
to the Taovaya helped forge an uneasy and short-lived trading alliance. The Nacogdoches firm
of Barr and Davenport, formed in 1798, successfully lobbied the Spanish Government to grant
an exception to the trade laws. This allowed them to trade Louisiana goods for east Texas Indian
furs, horses, and hides. The firm was also granted a legal exemption that allowed them to export
horses to Louisian (Faulk 1964:96-97).
Because of the many changes in political possession of northeast Texas and Louisiana and the
almost constant warfare between Indian tribes, the smuggling of tobacco, cloth, and horses was
commonplace throughout the eighteenth century. Ironically, Spanish law encouraged this activity.
First, the laws denied Spanish citizens the right to trade with French Louisiana. Scond, as goods
11

moved between Mexico and Texas, they were taxed heavily as they crossed each provincial
boundary. Finally, unscrupulous governors and presidio captains would often ignore the laws
(Faulk 1964:97-98).
Nineteenth Century
Taovaya Abandonment of the Area
Although trade relations were re-established with the Taovaya after 172, the Spanish broke the
alliance by transferring ownership of Louisiana back to France in 1800. Three years later France
sold Louisiana to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase (Morris 1970:82). Although Spain
objected, the United States quickly took control of the Red River and began trading with the
Taovaya. However, constant attacks by the Osage on trading parties, most notably that of Captain
Anthony Glass, again stemmed the Indian trade. The Wichitas had also had enough of the
relentless Osage; in 1811 they abandoned Twin Villages and headed south to join with the
Tawakonis, presumably around present-day Waco and Palestine (Krieger 1996:213; Morris
1970:82).

Smith County History
Clovis points have been found in the county, suggesting that the area has been occupied at least
periodically over the past 11,000+ years. However, the Caddo Indians are the first documented
Native Americans in historic times. The Anadarkos, a sub-group of the Caddo occupied the area
long before the arrival of the first European in 1765 - Spanish missionary Jose Francisco
Calahorra y Saenz. By the late 1700s, the Caddo had been decimated by disease, and forced by
the Cherokee and other Indians to abandon the area, and by 1820, the area was inhabited by the
Cherokees who infiltrated from North Texas. In the 1820s and early 1830s, the Mexican
government issued land grants to empressarios such as David G. Burnet, Peter Ellis Bean, and
Vincent Filisola. Nevertheless, continuing Indian depredations inhibited any permanent settlement
in the 1830s. By the time Texas gained her independence from Mexico in 1836, there were 40
people, three trading posts, and a salt works. Even then, most of the people fled the county after
the fall of the Alamo. The uneasy tensions were calmed following the defeat of the Mexicans at
San Jacinto in 1836, and following the forced removal of the Cherokees after the Cherokee War
in 1839 (McCrosky 1996).
New homesteaders from Alabama, Tennessee and other southern states were enticed into the area,
and in 1846 Smith County was organized. By the 1850s, settlers were actively trading via oxdrawn wagons between New Orleans, Shreveport, and Tyler along the Dallas-Shreveport Road.
The first newspaper in the county was the Tyler Telegraph published weekly beginning in 1851,
and Tyler University opened in the early 1850s. By 1860, the county’s population had boomed
to over 13,000. That same year, the county had 6 sawmills, 5 gristmills, 3 corn-whiskey
distilleries, 17 blacksmith shops, 9 wagon makers, 3 saddle shops, 5 cabinetmakers, 31 general
stores, 31 schools, 45 churches, and 5 Masonic lodges. As with the rest of the country and all of
12

Texas, Smith County residents and the economy were devastated. However, a large ordnance
plant located in Tyler employed 75 workers, and Camp Ford, a Union prisoner-of-war camp was
established near Tyler (McCrosky 1996; Thoms 2000).
Reconstruction efforts and racial tensions were rampant in Smith County, as they were for most
of Texas. Nevertheless, cotton production stimulated the local economy so that over 45,000 bales
were produced in 1880, and farmers grew over a million bushels of corn and oats. By 1890, new
industries in Tyler included a box manufacturer, a bottling works, a cigar factory, two national
banks, four sawmills, an ice factory, and six canning companies. By the turn of the century local
farmers had turned their focus on orchards and the variety of fruit that could be plentifully grown
and exported. In addition, they figured out that the acidic soils around Tyler were ideal for
growing roses, ultimately resulting in Tyler being known as the Rose Capitol of Texas, and the
first Texas Rose Festival being held in 1933 (McCrosky 1996).
Although numerous dirt and gravel roads crisscrossed the county before 1921, the Dixie Highway
constructed in 1921 between Tyler and Winona became the first hard-surface road. It was built
from iron ore, gravel, asphalt, and crushed limestone. As with the rest of the country, Smith
County residents were negatively impacted by the dismal economy of the Great Depression
beginning about 1929. The staple cotton crop fell due to an overabundance in production along
with boll weevil infestation. Federal programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps helped
revive the local economy. They constructed schools, dams, fences, planted trees and grass, and
developed Tyler State Park. However, the real economic stimulus came from the discovery of oil
in 1931, and the exploitation of the East Texas oilfield. Concurrently, the county’s population
increased to over 69,000 by 1940 (McCrosky 1996).
Ironically, the atrocities of World War II brought further prosperity to the citizens of Smith
County. In 1943, an Infantry training center was constructed near Owentown, bringing with ti
2,500 jobs, Army soldiers, and prisoners of war. Following the war, the oil industry continued to
expand exponentially, and in 1949 a dam was constructed across Prairie Creek to create Lake
Tyler. The attraction of the lake brought vacationers, fishermen, and tourists. In 1966, another
dam was constructed across Mud Creek to create Lake Tyler East. The growth of roses continued
so that by 1969, roses were the most lucrative crop grown, although lumbering and sawmills also
comprised a very important portion of the local economy (McCrosky 1996).

Archaeological Background Review
Smith County
Professional archaeologists began documenting archaeological sites in Smith County in the 1950s.
A review of the Texas Atlas Online indicated that as of January 15, 2016 there were 480
archaeological sites recorded within Smith County. Of those 480, 146 (30.4%) can be categorized
13

as prehistoric open campsites or open habitation sites, where there was not convincing evidence
that the occupants remained at those sites for extensive periods. Typically, these sites exhibit
hearth remnants, along with scattered pottery sherds, lithic debitage and perhaps ground stones
and faunal remains. Diagnostics found at these sites suggest a continuum of occupation(s) from
the Paleoindian through early Historic periods. Conversely, evidence of intensive and prolonged
occupations, and relatively more sedentary occupations had been found at 51 sites. These sites
exhibited multiple hearth features, a wider variety and abundance of pottery types, a wider variety
and quantity of stone tools and faunal remains, and occasionally exhibit mounds and burials. In
that regard, 51 of the 480 recorded sites can be classified as Caddo hamlets, villages, or
farmsteads.
Lithic scatters are the most prevalent of the prehistoric archaeological sites recorded within Smith
County. A total of 162 (33.8%) of the 480 sites can be classified as lithic scatters. As with
prehistoric open campsites in Smith County, diagnostics found at these sites suggest a continuum
of occupation(s) from the Paleoindian through early Historic periods. These sites simply represent
the chipped stone debris and broken tools that were left behind when Native Americans made new
tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural
material normally found at open campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there
for any extended period of time (however, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert
or quartzite cobbles to make them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales
because of the natural outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as
chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include
cobbles with one or two flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans
knew from experience the quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone
tool production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality
was judged to be inferior, then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested
cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone
tool products are carried away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the
manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular
debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’.
These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’
that can be used to further reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it.
The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried
off, presumably to areas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry
blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Prehistoric burials have been found at 23 sites. They range from a single burial to multiple burials
within Caddoan cemeteries. There have been 130 known Historic components documented within
the county. They are diverse in both nature and age. They consist of multiple late 1800s and early
1900s trash scatters, numerous farmsteads, homesteads, single houses, and family cemeteries.
Unique historical sites include five 1800s salt processing facility with furnaces, an 1800s log
cabin, late 1800s and early 1900s one-room schools, WWII training sites, Civilian Conservation
Corps encampments and construction sites, 1900s cotton gins and mills, an early 1900s pottery
kiln, a quarry pit turned fish hatchery, an 1800s plantation house, and 1850s bridge across the
14

Sabine River, a sandstone fish weir, a cattle dipping vat, early 1900s churches, and early 1900s
railroad grades.
There are 26 State Archaeological Landmarks within Smith County. Predominantly, they include
Caddoan mounds, hamlets, villages, and campsites. Others of particular note are a Civilian
Conservation Corps camp in Tyler State Park, the Carnegie Public Library in Tyler, the GoodmanLeGrand House in Tyler, the Tyler Hydraulic-fill Dam, and Camp Ford. During the Civil War,
Camp Ford was located near Tyler, and was the largest prisoner of war camp west of the
Mississippi for Union soldiers (Thoms 2000).
Project Area
As shown in Figure 3, there have been two professional archaeological surveys conducted and
four archaeological sites recorded within one mile of the Project Area. There are no documented
State Archeological Landmarks within one mile, but there are three National Register of Historic
Properties listed.
Archaeological Surveys
In 2002, AR Consultants, Inc. archaeologists conducted a survey of Woldert Park for the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department and the City of Tyler, resulting in the discovery of site 41SM293
and documenting of three other previously recorded sites - 41SM35, 41SM36, and 41SM41
(briefly described below). In 2012, AJC Environmental archaeologists conducted an area survey.
No previously undiscovered sites were found, but previously recorded site 41SM33 lies within
that area.
Archaeological Sites
41SM33 - This prehistoric site of an unknown age is situated on a protruding finger ridge above
the north bank of Black Fork Creek. It was recorded in 1941 by legendary archaeologist Jack
Hughes. No other information is available on the Texas Atlas.
41SM35 - This prehistoric site of an unknown age was recorded in 1943, also by Jack Hughes.
It lies on a sideslope on the south edge of Black Fork Creek. Little else is known of the site.
41SM36 - Jack Hughes recorded this site in 1943. With the discovery of a Gary dart point, it is
described as an Archaic campsite. Artifacts spread across the surface encompassed an area of
roughly 300 meters x 600 meters on a terrace on the south side of Black Fork Creek. In addition,
artifacts were discovered in five out of ten shovel tests excavated at the site.
41SM293 - This early Caddoan open campsite was found in 2012 by AR Consultants, Inc.
Archaeologists during a survey of Woldert Park. At that time they observed grog-tempered potery
sherds, along with scattered fire-cracked rocks and lithic debitage across a surface area of roughly
27 meters x 20 meters. The results of shovel testing revealed a sherd and six lithics to a depth of

15

12 centimeters below the surface. However, the site was heavily eroded to shallow clay and
generally assessed as non-significant.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around both prehistoric and historic patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and
social systems for the Northeast Texas Archaeological Region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)
locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;
2)
quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
3)
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Prefield Preparation
Before the official survey began, the Principal Investigator reviewed the Texas Archeological Site
database to determine what archaeological sites had been recorded within one mile of the project
area. Following that, a thorough review of the literature pertaining to the area was conducted, and
site and survey reports from the area were examined. Then, USGS 7.5 quadrangle maps, a soils
map, and a geological atlas sheet were consulted.

The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the Project
Area was conducted. Surface visibility ranged from 0 to 30-percent within the tower footprint
area, and roughly 30 to 100 percent along the utility/access right-of-way (see, for example Figures
6-9). In addition, rodent and mammal backdirt piles and eroded surfaces were common; all of
these exposures were visually inspected for the presence of cultural material.
A total of 14 shovel tests were excavated. Shovel tests were excavated to a depth of at least 70
cm; or if shallower, to the depth of sterile Pleistocene soils. Our Scope of Work specified that if
cultural materials were encountered from 60-70 cm, then additional levels would be excavated
in an attempt to determine the vertical extent of cultural deposits. All shovel test locations were

16

mapped on field maps, and their locations recorded with a hand-held Global Positioning System
(GPS).
Sediments from the shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments, and screened through 1/4inch wire mesh. The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms. The
Scope of Work specified that if cultural materials were encountered that indicated the likelihood
of an archaeological site, then additional shovel tests would be excavated at closer intervals in
order to further define the horizontal extent of the site.
Cultural materials of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, observed either on the
surface or within shovel tests were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented
via sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Following that they would be returned to the
surface if surface finds, or to the top 10 cm of shovel tests. Exceptions were to be those artifacts
which could be considered as particularly significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory,
such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. Those were to be
collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or
the Project Archaeologist.
In addition, any buildings 45 years or older that were located on or adjacent to the pipeline ROW
were to be documented with photographs and included in a Draft and Final report of
investigations.

Results of the Investigation
Modern trash items were observed on the surface. However, no prehistoric or historic cultural
materials were observed either on the surface or in any of the 14 shovel tests excavated. In
general, sterile and eroded clays were encountered either on the surface or very shallowly buried
under loam within the shovel tests. Locations of the shovel tests within the Project Area are
shown in Figure 10, and although the results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel
Test forms, a synthesis of the results is presented in Table 1.
In addition, no potentially historic structures either within the Project Area or adjacent to it were
present.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations

A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface areas that offered up to 70 percent surface visibility
was conducted before 14 shovel tests were excavated. No evidence of either prehistoric or historic
cultural materials was found either on or below the surface. As such, Tierras Antiguas
Archaeology recommends that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to oversee development of the
cellular tower tract and right-of-way as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development, work
should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds can be examined and evaluated by
Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.
